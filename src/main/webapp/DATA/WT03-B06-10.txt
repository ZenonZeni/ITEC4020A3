By Georges, they're gorgeous!

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Hisham Harun

WHEN my two friends and I were invited by French fashion export agent
Beatrice Bostyn to view several items from Georges Rech's latest
Fall/Winter accessory collection from Paris, we didn't quite expect to be
thoroughly bowled over.
  So what if Rech was famed for integrating creativity with realism, or
that he was one of the pioneers to revolutionise ready-to-wear in the
early 60s... we've seen so many great designs by numerous top couturiers
and so how much different could Rech be?
  Then we saw his new line of bags, scarves, shoes and jewellery which
were simply displayed on Bostyn's hotel room bed. We were captivated, to
say the least. Why, we even picked up some items with intent to buy.
  Sweet as she was, however, the marketing executive who had brought the
items down with her couldn't help us here as she was assigned by her
company, Anne Mucci, to look for potential Georges Rech distributors in
this region.
  The items Bostyn had brought with her would have to follow her to the
next destination, Singapore, and then later to Hong Kong and "a few other
places" before going back to the world's fashion capital.
  So there we were, clinging on to some of the most vibrant flowy floral
silk scarves, jewellery pieces, bags and shoes, feeling a tad
disappointed.
  Under Rech's establishment, big and bold jewellery that belonged to the
80s looked nonetheless elegant and classy.
  The smaller, simpler pieces looked chic and sophisticated while the more
artistic, almost avant garde ones, were contemporary, fun, stylish and
most importantly, still wearable.
  Rech's jewellery - that formed bracelets, necklaces and earrings - took
on basic oval, round or square shapes and came either in matte silver or
gold. Onyx and sparkling clear Swarovsky crystals were the main stones
used.
  The belts were mostly slim, and came in shades of brown and black with
silver and gold detailing as well as the popular GR logo that didn't seem
too loud or overbearing but gelled naturally with the overall look.
  In keeping with current trends, one could see that Rech also included
Prada-like buckles and the ever-popular Paloma Picasso criss-cross in his
range.
  Both the shoes and belts collection in ebony conformed to the minimalist
requirements of all that's classic and refined.
  Besides the generous flower prints, most of his designs for the scarves
were presented in a delicious offering of brown and red hues. Ribbons and
fruits were also the main focus.

Your last chance to catch `Tanah Abang'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

By Shuib Taib

TANAH Abang, a period play produced by Panggung Negara, will end its run
at Auditorium DBKL tomorrow. The curtain rises at 8.30pm.
  Tickets priced at RM10 can be obtained from Panggung Negara (tel:
2943022) or Matic (tel: 2643929).
  Scripted and directed by Onie Moraza, Tanah Abang tells of the British
intervention in the administration of Perak in 1528. In order to
strengthen his position, Sultan Muzaffar Shah (played by Karim Latiff)
decides to marry Tun Merah (Erma Fatima) and make her the new queen.
  However, his intention is misconstrued. Tun Merah's parents and brother
think he only wants her to fulfil his sexual needs, thus making her a
gundek or mistress. Tun Merah is naturally disgusted by the thought.
Besides, she has a long-time fiance.
  Also in the cast are veteran actor Zulkifli Zain who plays Megat
Terawis, Sidek Husin (Anjang), Mustafa Abu Bakar (Pedro) and Wan Norazlin
(Tun Perabu).

Just think: Childers, a true servant of justice

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

By Chandra Muzaffar

ONE of the most courageous and eloquent voices in the eternal struggle for
a just world is silent.
  Erskine Childers died of a heart attack on Aug 25 in Luxembourg hours
after making an impassioned speech on his favourite theme - the importance
of UN reform - at the 50th anniversary congress of the World Federation of
United Nations Associations (WFUNA) of which he was Secretary-General. He
was 67.
  In the last few years of his life, Childers campaigned with relentless
vigour for a United Nations which in its structure and content would
reflect the interests of the majority of humankind.
  He wanted the UN General Assembly in particular strengthened because it
was that one political organ in the UN system that, theoretically at
least, treated each and every member state as an equal.
  But the UN, he argued, should go beyond the nation state. It should,
through the creation of a new tier, give real meaning to that fundamental
concept embodied in the UN Charter, namely, "We, the peoples of the United
Nations."
  It was one of his great sorrows that the UN had been hijacked by the
powerful in the North, especially after the 1991 Gulf War. It was being
used against the nations of the South.
  For Childers, the UN was vital for the well-being of the South or the
Third World. It gave them the collective security that they needed in a
world dominated by the elites of the North.
  In a 1993 essay, essay he noted that, "The arrival of the Third World in
the United Nations ... was a truly epochal, history-making moment ... for
the whole of humankind ... For it was the first moment in the entire
history of human life on this planet when all of its societies could meet
in one place, supposedly on terms of equality and mutual respect among
nations large and small, to strengthen common standards of behaviour and
to develop and then implement all across the world common programmes for
peace, justice, and social and economic equity."
  But Childers knew that if the UN had failed to realise the aspirations
of the people of the South, it was because the entire international system
was weighed against the interests of the majority of humankind.
  The intellectual, economic and social, and political frameworks had been
established in such a manner that they facilitated the dominance of the
world by a small minority located largely in the West.
  Western intellectual domination, for instance, "closed down, placed in a
straitjacket, all indigenous processes of intellectual enquiry and
evolution of political and social institutions of most of humankind...
Whole peoples were taught that nothing in their culture, however long
proven and however vibrant, was any longer worth anything; that the only
way to that condition called `progress' was to learn from their colonial
masters."
  As he lamented the intellectual suppression of the South, so did
Childers lambast the gross iniquities in the economic and social relations
between the North and the South.
  He was never tired of highlighting that indisputable fact that in the
Nineties, the 20 per cent Northern minority controls 82.7 per cent of
world gross national product; 81.2 per cent of world trade; 80.5 per cent
of domestic investment; and 94 per cent of research and development.
  Childers would often quote the UN Development Programme which has
calculated that "the developing countries are losing over US$500 billion a
year in income that they could earn, because of protectionist barriers
against the exports they try to sell to the North, because of Northern
manipulation of interest rates on their borrowings, and because of other
structural inequities between the North and the South. That is to say that
the policies of Northern governments are preventing the developing
countries from earning 10 times all the official aid they receive from the
North."
  For Childers, the political framework of the North-South divide was also
a major cause of global tensions and conflicts.
  He bemoaned "the imperial legacy of grafting the western centralist
nation state onto every society in the world, whether or not that
structure had the remotest relevance or "fit" to the value-systems of a
given culture."
  It is partly because of this that ethnic conflagrations continue to
break out every now and then in many post-colonial societies.
  These conflagrations deeply troubled Childers which is why he often
implored the UN to develop mechanisms that could deal with ethnic and
cultural conflicts.
  The UN - its shortcomings notwithstanding - had a very special place in
Childers' heart for it was in the UN that he built his career.
  He joined the UN secretariat in 1967 and worked with almost every organ
and agency within the UN system in different parts of the world for 22
years.
  His last UN post was that of Senior Adviser to the UN Director for
Development and International Economic Cooperation.
  After his retirement, he continued to travel all over the world talking
and writing about global injustices with that passion and commitment that
was his trademark.
  It was at one such conference on UN intervention and national
sovereignty in Sigtuna, Sweden in May 1992 that I first met with Erskine
Childers.
  We met a couple of times after that and corresponded with one another.
  When Just World Trust (JUST) established an International Advisory
Panel, he was one of the first persons I approached to become a member. He
accepted the invitation with much enthusiasm.
  Later, in December 1994, he was one of the main speakers at the JUST
international conference on "Rethinking Human Rights" in Kuala Lumpur.
  At the conference and in a television interview I did with him, Childers
spoke in great detail about how crucial it was to organise and mobilise
the South to fight the injustices in the global system.
  Indeed, fighting for justice was in the genes of the man. His
grandfather was a revolutionary who gave his life for the cause of Irish
freedom.
  Executed by the British in 1992 for treason, Erskine Childers won
international fame as the author of the classic, The Riddle of the Sands.
  His son, also Erskine Childers, became President of Ireland and was also
a steadfast advocate of social justice.
  It is one of the sad ironies of life that the second Erskine Childers
also died after delivering a speech.
  Coming from a family with such a strong love for justice, was it any
wonder that the third Erskine Childers took up cudgels on behalf of the
oppressed and the downtrodden?
  It is significant in this regard that the cause that first attracted the
energy of the young Childers was Palestine.
  His first book, Common Sense about the Arab World, was a product of this
commitment. His second book, The Road To Suez: A Study In Western-Arab
Relations, expanded the ideas in the first book and articulated profound
concerns about inter-civilisational ties which remained dear to Childers
till the end of his life.
  In more specific language, Childers felt that the West has been terribly
unjust in its treatment of Arab, and, in a larger sense, Islamic
civilisation.
  The West has to this day sought to block out its collective
consciousness its immeasurable debt to the Arabs and Muslims for "the very
rise of Western civilisation itself".
  Childers called this "the largest self-induced amnesia in human
history".
  His incisive analysis of this phenomenon is contained in one of his most
brilliant essays entitled "Amnesia and Antagonism" which JUST helped to
distribute worldwide.
  In it Childers employs meticulous scholarship to illustrate how in
almost every sphere of human activity, Europe borrowed heavily from Arab
and Muslim sources.
  From medicine and mathematics to architecture and the arts to government
and commerce, the European Renaissance absorbed a whole variety of ideas
and institutions from the Islamic world.
  As an example, Childers observes that, "The million word Qanun of Ibn-
Sina (980-1037) cataloguing all then-known ailments, diseases and their
treatments, was the prime textbook of the new medical schools at Paris,
Bologna, Montpellier, Padua and Naples and continued in use until the
early eighteenth century."
  The adamant, arrogant refusal to acknowledge the pervasive influence and
impact of Islam upon the West was not the only injustice which concerned
Childers; in the interface between the two civilisations, the West has
also displayed a great deal of antagonism towards Islam.
  He attributes Western antagonism to theological differences, to the
Muslim occupation of parts of Europe, to the Crusades, to colonialism, and
to contemporary neo-colonial interests.
  It is mainly because of the desire of the centres of power in the West
to protect and perpetuate their economic interests, specifically oil, that
certain important Western governments pursue foreign policies that are so
palpably unjust to the Muslim world - especially those countries that are
determined to preserve their independence and autonomy.
  Childers regarded this as a formidable obstacle to any Western-Islamic
dialogue.
  In fact, he believed that, "The dissolution of the Russian-Soviet empire
has released the West from its historically brief fixation with that
particular "East", just as its concerns with its original demon-East -
Islam - have begun a new cycle of volatitily."
  In order to break this volatile cycle, the West, Childers was convinced,
should try to be just and fair to Islam and Muslims.
  Whether it was the relationship between the West and Islam or the divide
between the North and the South, Erskine Childers' paramount
consideration, it is apparent, was justice. It is, in that sense, that he
was a true servant of justice with very few parallels in the modern world.

Bolshoi Ballet set to mesmerise KL folk

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 5

By Hafidah Samat

IT isn't everyday that Sleeping Beauty wakes up to paint the town red. But
the Bolshoi Ballet of Tashkent is offering nothing less with their
mesmerising performances when they stage a three-act ballet of the 19th-
century classic Sleeping Beauty, in Kuala Lumpur.
  The performance, which will be taking centrestage for two days starting
Oct 31, is organised by Event Management (EM) Consultants Sdn Bhd in
collaboration with MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity Fund.
  To formalise the understanding between MAA-Medicare and EM Management
Consultants Sdn Bhd, a memorandum was signed recently.
  Signing on behalf of MAA-Medicare was Datuk Lee Lam Thye, a member of
the Board of Trustees, while EM Consultants was represented by its
managing director, Syed Isa Syed Alwi.
  According to Lee, the primary aim of the MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity
Fund is to provide more affordable dialysis treament to patients
throughout the nation.
  "In only one-and-half-years, we have successfully set up three charity
dialysis centres which are located in Kuala Lumpur, Teluk Intan and
Butterworth," he adds.
  The largest is the one in KL which is treating 89 patients and has 19
haemodialysis machines. The Teluk Intan branch has seven machines and
treats 14 patients, while the Butterworth branch, which was launched in
May, is treating seven patients with five machines.
  "Our efforts have benefited more than 110 patients who are charged RM99
per bicarbonate treatment. This is much cheaper than those charged by
private clinics and hospitals which are between RM150-RM250 per
treatment," says Lee.
  According to Lee the urgent need for more charity centres is evident as
insufficient funds and the lack of machines have caused many unnecessary
deaths.
  "These projects require huge funding. Besides appealing to corporate
bodies and the public for financial support, we are open to co-operating
with any party to organise fund-raising activities," says Lee.
  And of course, one such event will be the Bolshoi Ballet's performances
in KL. According to Syed Isa, the 120-member troupe will include 40
orchestra musicians and 53 dancers.
  "The Bolshoi Ballet is in the middle of its Asian tour and Malaysia will
mark its first stop," says Syed Isa.
  "We strongly feel that this cultural exposure will enable Malaysians to
witness world-class performances ...
  "We will ensure that its two-hour show is going to be entirely different
from any other ballet performance," say Syed Isa.
  All proceeds from the performances will be forwarded to MAA-Medicare
Kidney Charity Fund.
  "We hope to donate about RM500,000 to the fund, but this depends on the
ticket collection," says Syed Isa.
  The production of Sleeping Beauty was first staged in St Petersburg in
1890 and was adapted from Charles Perrault's fairy tale.
  Tickets for the charity premier show on Oct 31 are priced at RM250,
RM350, RM550 and RM800. Tickets for the performance on Nov 1 are priced at
RM180, RM250, RM450 and RM800.
  For corporate bodies, tickets can be purchased in various packages of
differing amounts and privileges.
  For futher information, call Abdul Aziz of EM Consultants Sdn Bhd at 03-
9811129 or MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity Fund at 03-4447906.

Music magic from piano duo

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 5

By Shuib Taib

WHEN you are on your own in a foreign land, the will to "carry on"
inevitably becomes stronger despite the odds.
  Take Dennis Lee, for instance. Born in Penang, the professional pianist
has come a long way since the first time he played the piano. Like most
professional musicians, Lee also had to sit for one exam after another to
upgrade himself.
  At 14, Lee won a scholarship to study piano - with Angus Morrison - and
violin at the Royal College of Music. Having obtained his Bachelor of
Music with First Class Honours and his Masters of Music, he then received
an Austrian government scholarship to study with Joseph Dichler in Vienna
where he earned both the Akademie Diploma with Distinction and the
Stepanow Prize.
  And when he was in Venice, Lee had to continue his piano lessons in
Milan. He had no money then.
  "Then again, music has nothing to do with economics. It's not only for
the rich, and no one should be deprived of it," chips in his wife, Toh
Chee Hung.
  Lee, who was penniless at the time somehow managed to find his way to
Milan for his practices. This he did religiously until he completed his
course.
  "I think music is magic. It is multi-functional and can help train your
mind. It teaches you to be disciplined, helps you to co-ordinate and to
use your five senses to your advantage," says Lee.
  It was also in Milan that Lee met his wife, Toh.
  "You could say that, for us, Europe is where it all happened. Musically
speaking, it's where classical music began and it is also where we first
met." While Lee had to travel from Venice to Milan, Toh travelled from
Switzerland for her piano lessons with the same 95-year-old teacher named
Kodaly.
  "For geographical reasons, we are now based in London as it's difficult
to stay in Asia and travel to Europe regularly to fulfil engagements,"
explains Toh.
  Like Lee, Toh also sat for many examinations and won many prizes. Born
in Singapore, Toh studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London under
Max Pirani. She then won the Sterndale Bennett Prize, Christie Moore Award
and MacFarren Gold Medal (the top piano prize).
  She has also made recordings that have been aired worldwide over the BBC
World Service. Before finally residing in London, she held various
professional posts in Switzerland.
  While Lee has performed in Washington DC, Japan, Malta, France, Germany,
Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, Toh has toured Britain, US, Canada,
Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and the Far East.
  Their 1996 appearances include performances in France, Italy, US,
Canada, Malaysia and the Barbican Centre in London.
  Lee and Toh are in Malaysia for a series of special performances - two
held over the weekend in Ipoh and Penang and the third tomorrow - called
"Piano Duo" where, for the first time, they are featured side by side.
  Although it is rare to see two pianists playing simultaneously, Lee says
that "it should be interesting to hear different interpretations of the
same melodies. We will do four songs together and one solo piece each".
  "You will hear stereo-phonic sound and it should also be interesting to
see two people in action at the same time."
  Their final performance will be held tomorrow at the Petaling Jaya Civic
Centre at 8pm. Tickets, priced at RM30, can be obtained from Yamaha Music
branches in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya as well as Sedaya Music College
and L & J Music Studio, Old Klang Road.

First person: Why some films turn me into a wretched sob queen

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

By Saleha Ali

I TRIED but I still cried.
  Okay, if you must know, movies have a way of affecting me up close and
personal. Forget about self control, the tears will just roll.
  Last week, I found myself weeping unabashedly in the theatre (yet
again!) as this guy puffed his last breath in the arms of his lady,
stricken as he was with some malignant brain disease.
  I wasn't sure who was more devastated, me or the silver screen blonde.
As I stumbled out of the darkened cinema, I remembered why I had vowed to
see tear-jerkers only in the safe haven of the living room.
  You see, once the lights go up and reality bites, red puffy eyes are
just a no-no.
  This crying game will strike when you least expect it too. For instance,
is Independence Day a heartrending tale? Far from it, right?
  Hmmm, that was what I thought. No prizes for guessing who left the
cineplex with a wrung-out heart and an all-night sniffle after seeing the
newly-widowed US President holding on to his little daughter for strength.
  On assignment in Singapore some time ago, I caught a movie called Bright
Lights Big City, about a young man coming to terms with his mother's
impending death from cancer.
  That struck too close to home. A colleague, Joan, who shared the same
experience, broke down in floods too.
  Boy, was I glad I was home alone when I saw The Joy Luck Club. Grief
struck at almost every juncture and at the end of it, I felt faintly
dehydrated.
  The film, on the lives of four courageous women and their rapport with
their daughters, was only too reminiscent of my sometimes turbulent
relationship with my late mother.
  I saw my enterprising, take-the-bull-by-the-horns Mak in the mothers and
caught glimpses of the hurting child that I used to be in the daughters.
  You see, because of Mak's constant chidings (she used to think I was the
world's greatest procrastinator), I thought she loved me least until I saw
her hastily wiping away tears when I made my maiden voyage to KL to attend
college years ago.
  Altitute doesn't help matters, I have discovered. The watertap can still
flow some 15,000km above sea level.
  I recall seeing several in-flight movies which left me completely
bereft. One was Father Of The Bride II (I know, I know!).
  You see, while it had a good dosage of Steve Martin's hilarity, there
were also plenty of tender father-daughter bonding scenes, not unlike
moments when my dad carried me on his back at age five to do some awesome
underwater swimming and gave me the thumbs-up when I brought home my first
domestic science achievement - a wobbly concoction called cornflour mould.
  The list goes on. Watching The Mambo Kings turned me into a wretched sob
queen. It was seeing the sacrifices that the older sibling made to keep
the younger one afloat that got me.
  Another film, Mr Wonderful, about a couple who separate only to discover
that there are many invisible threads holding them together, sadly
reminded me of ... well, never mind.
  So, you get the picture. Tales of family, loss of a loved one, human
bonding, unrequited love, injustice and missed opportunities touch me in
the raw.
  I wish sometimes that I could crow along to Jim Carrey's antics but
slapstick humour leaves me cold. No, you would not find me buying popcorn
in readiness for an Ace Ventura evening.
  Nor am I inclined to drool over brawny Arnie Schwarzenegger in The
Terminator or hunky Bruce Willis in the Die Hard series.
  But I relish feature films which are warm and witty, with a pulse on
real life situations. I appreciate lines which remind us of something or
someone.
  But then again, these are the very movies which can ruthlessly peel away
at the layers of armour we wear to shield off the elements.
  I would like to think it is all therapeutic, this blubbering and losing
all sense and sensibility watching films like Sleepless In Seattle, French
Kiss and Forget Paris, not to speak of the out-and-out "heavies" like
Cyrano De Bergerac and The Scarlet Letter.
  But it has made me distinctly wary of even titles like Pinocchio and The
Hunchback of Notre Dame....!

Enlightening on AIDS

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 9

By Cheah Chor Sooi

THE deadly HIV/AIDS is the cover story for this month's issue of Jelita.
  Writer Lily Haslina Nasir interviews Health Ministry Public Health
Department AIDS/HIV Division deputy director Datin Dr Harrison Aziz
Shahabuddin as well as Tenaganita director Irene Fernandez on the issue.
  They agree that every woman should have the right to question her hubby
if she is doubtful of his health status.
  "The present mind frame that the decision to pursue sexual intercourse
lies with the man should change.
  "Women have the right to probe if they become suspicious of their
spouse's movements. The truth is, it has become more difficult these days
to ascertain if one party has remained faithful to the other."
  Jelita relates the first-hand experiences of women who have fallen prey
to the disease because of their husbands' infidelity.
  Early detection helps greatly to counter the spread of the disease. Find
out the necessary steps to take if the medical check-up shows that you are
a carrier or have contracted AIDS.
  There is also a list of counselling bodies and voluntary organisations
that can lend a hand to ease suffering.
  In the world of dresses, view the elegant kebaya and baju kurung made
contemporary after being fashioned from silk and batik.
  For those taking exams, Jelita gives tips on how to get good grades.
  Annual subscription rate for Jelita is RM64.30 in Peninsular Malaysia
and RM84.30 for Sabah and Sarawak.
  Maxima cardmembers enjoy a special subscription rate of RM56.20 for
Peninsular Malaysia and RM73.70 for Sabah and Sarawak.

By Sharmane Raphael

YOU do not need to resort to acrobatics and black leather to have good
sex. All you need is a little time and an indispensable guide to rekindle
the passion in your love life.
  In The 7-Day Guide To A Better Sex Life, the writer says that "the bad
sex or no sex at all situation" can be improved and sex life can be made
more enjoyable.
  If you would like to bring back the excitement and romance into your
life, why not get a few helpful hints from the writer?
  Those who wish to protect their skin against stretch marks can look into
the three simple steps offered in The Truth About Stretch Marks.
  Here, the writer sheds the age-old myth about acquiring stretch marks
only after pregnancy and offers useful tips on reducing them, since total
elimination seems to be out of the question.
  If you think fashion is only limited to your wardrobe, handbag and
shoes, think again as eyewear begins to join the line-up, says Anis Ramli
in Vision 20/20.
  "It is no surprise that some eyewear companies consider eyeframe design
a work of art," she says. "They combine new materials with major
breakthroughs in technology and engineering to develop the most advanced
and high tech eyeframes ever to be seen."
  So, if you want to be part of the in-crowd, catch some of the latest
trends for this year's eyewear fashion.

effective business plan is one way to avoid the nerve-wracking pitfalls.
  So if you're an aspiring entrepreneur, Nathan Balakrishnan, in his two-
part series, gives five tips on what an effective business plan should
cover.
  "Whatever your intentions, a plan that's well thought of will help you
map out the course of your business and help uncover areas you hadn't
considered before," he says in Start Your Own Business Successfully.
  He also gives several pointers on promoting your products and services
and how you can increase sales.
  If you're bidding farewell to those good 'ol thirties and preparing to
enter a new decade of life, Surinder Jessy and Anis Ramli can certainly
offer some helpful hints in Health Beauty For The Mature Woman.
  The key seems to be in successful ageing and the authors have certainly
presented several simple yet effective secrets to maintain that fountain
of youth.
  If you think your face alone will conceal your real age, your hands,
neck, decolletage and feet will certainly betray you if you have not been
looking after them, says Sunita Chhabra in Telltale Anatomy.
  She offers some helpful prevention measures.
  Still on the "age" topic, find out about the benefits of Hormone
Replacement Therapy which can drastically improve your life after

Bead stringer's adroitness draws the crowd

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Azura Abas

CULTURAL EXTRAVAGANZA ... Nonrinji Mantuku from the Rungus tribe was a
star attraction with her bead work at the "Mini Sabah" promotion at the
Sungai Wang Plaza in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
  The promotion was among a host of cultural activities held in
conjunction with Malaysia Fest which was launched on Saturday night.
  Mantuku, 36, from Kudat, a full-time beads stringer in her village,
said: "It only takes me a day to string beads with simple patterns while
it takes almost a week to complete those with difficult patterns."
  She learnt it from her mother when she was only 10 and hopes her six
daughters will continue the colourful tradition. Beads are the main
decorative items of the tribal women.
  Other attractions of the promotion included demonstrations on making the
Kota Belud parang or machete, Tandek rattan mat, Ranau tree bark yarn,
Nabawan bag and Kota Merudu basket-weaving.
  The 15-day promotion was launched by Sabah Tourism and Environmental
Assistant Minister Nahalan Damsal.
  Meanwhile in Petaling Jaya, the Pahang Government launched its Cultural
and Arts Festival under the theme "Treasures of Pahang".
  State Culture and Arts Committee chairman Datuk Law Kee Long launched
the festival using a traditional blow-pipe to burst a balloon filled with
coloured particles at the foyer of Subang Parade shopping complex.
  It was then followed by an Orang Asli dance and several cultural dances
staged by a State cultural group.

KL to play major role in R&D of renewable energy resources

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Syed Nadzri in Harare

MALAYSIA will play a major role in the development of renewable energy
resources in the absence of a strong commitment from the West towards
international efforts in this area.
  Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the country was
always prepared to be at the forefront of research and development
strategies to counter depleting energy sources.
  "We are showing our commitment and will continue with our efforts," he
told reporters after attending an investment briefing at the Zimbabwe
Industrial Corporation office yesterday.
  Dr Mahathir's affirmation came a day after he was appointed vice-
president of the World Solar Commission which is organising the Second
World Solar Summit here from today.
  He is one of the two vice-presidents of the commission headed by
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. The other is Pakistani President Farouq
Ahmad Khan Leghari.
  The presence of Dr Mahathir and Leghari added the only sparkle to the
otherwise lacklustre summit which was supposed to be attended by no less
than 14 heads of government.
  Asked on the poor turnout, especially the absence of leaders from
developed countries, Dr Mahathir said he could not find a clear reason.
  "Maybe they are not interested in solar energy," he quipped.
  The Prime Minister was also asked whether the commission would face
problems due to lack of financial support from the richer countries.
  He admitted that development efforts would be a little difficult because
"people with funds are not too keen".
  Later in the afternoon, he witnessed the signing of investment
agreements involving YTL Corporation which has won the privatisation
contract of a power station at Hwange.
  Asked on the role of Malaysian companies in the development of Zimbabwe,
the Prime Minister said the firms could contribute effectively based on
their experiences in Malaysia which had trodden Zimbabwe's path before.
  "Zimbabwe is at the begining of an industrial process and this is
somewhat similiar to what Malaysia went through several years ago.
  "At the moment, Malaysian companies are concentrating on infrastructure
development. Once this is achieved, they will venture into other areas,
especially labour-intensive industries," he said.

Interview checklist

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Nor Azlina Abdul Wahab

YOU can't escape them. For most of us anyway. For employment or enrolment
in a tertiary institution, the interview can determine, in a large part,
your acceptance or rejection by the other party.
  In an interview, which is a face-to-face meeting, communication skills
are required. This is not as complicated as it sounds. You won't need to
attend classes to acquire such skills. What would be useful is a checklist
of what you would need, and need to avoid.
  Before the interview, make sure you:
  * Confirm your attendance by calling up the organisation or sending the
reply cards if required.
  * Find out the exact location of the interview prior to the session so
that you will know your way around on the big day.
  * Read and find out more about the job or course that you are applying
for and the organisation or the institution involved.
  * Prepare the relevant documents in a file. Don't have them folded or
stapled together.
  * Prepare intelligent questions, such as "What are the job/course
prospects?"
  * Prepare the correct attire and be presentable. Avoid wearing colours
that are too bright. Try to wear soft, but not dull, colours. Avoid jeans
or T-shirts.
  * Arrive early and act in a proper manner while waiting for your turn.
  During the interview:
  * Do knock on the door before entering unless the door is being opened
for you.
  * Do greet the interviewers appropriately and wait until you are asked
to be seated. Sit straight, but not stiffly with your hands folded over
defensively.
  * Do watch your body language. Avoid habits such as picking your nose or
biting your nails.
  * Do relax and answer positively but politely. Avoid answering with a
simple "yes" or "no". Try to use "Usually, but...", or "Yes, unless...",
or even "It depends on what you mean by..."
  * Do take the chance given to ask questions.
  * Do watch out for the interviewer's tricks. Try not to be angry easily.
Furthermore, do not curse in any language.
  * Do thank the interviewer for seeing you when leaving.
  Even though the qualities that interviewers look for differ depending on
the situation, there are a few aspects that are usually evaluated. These
are:
  * Physical appearance, which includes your dressing.
  * General knowledge.
  * Special skills that you have.
  * Personal interests.
  * Your attainments.
  This may not be the A to Z guide on interviews, but it is a basic
checklist for that all-important date.

Health threat from poor alien worker screening methods

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Ramlan Said

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Malaysian Medical Association today expressed
concern over weaknesses in the health screening procedures for foreign
workers which are posing a threat to public health.
  Dr Tibbs Fernandez, chairman of its Private Practitioners Section, said
this was the reason behind the increase in cases of communicable and
contagious diseases in the country, some of which had for years been
successfully controlled or eradicated.
  Public health would be at risk as the diseases were contractable, he
added.
  He said reported cases like malaria, tuberculosis and elephantiasis at
government hospitals among foreign workers were disproportionate to their
population in Malaysia, indicating the seriousness of the problem.
  He said even diseases that had never been seen or detected for a long
time in Malaysia like kala-azar had surfaced. Kala-azar is a viral
infection which causes inflamation of the liver.
  "No doubt the country's development is partly dependent on foreign
workers but it should not be at the expense of public health."
  There are about two million foreign workers in Malaysia.
  Dr Fernandez was speaking to reporters after chairing the section's
first national working committee at Bangunan MMA. Also present was MMA
president-elect, Dr Milton Lum.
  Dr Fernandez said the diseases were most probably brought in by foreign
workers who came mostly from less developed countries with inferior public
health systems.
  He said the problem could be overcome through a concerted and systematic
approach from the authorities, like stricter enforcement especially in
nabbing illegals and enhancing screening procedures.
  "For instance, one problem that can be ironed out is the refusal by some
Immigration Department offices to use a medical examination form with a
new format for foreign workers although the Health Ministry and MMA have
agreed on it."
  Dr Fernandez said the council had tried to solve the matter with the
Task Force on Foreign Workers but was unsuccessful.
  He also said medical tests for foreign workers should not be monopolised
by certain groups. He declined to elaborate on the matter.
  Dr Fernandez added that MMA fully supported action against those found
manipulating medical tests for foreign workers, even if it involved
private doctors and laboratories.
  "The medical screening exercise is time-consuming and costly especially
for employers.
  "But we can't afford to cut corners as the consequences would be
disastrous."
  A standard medical test for a male and female foreign worker costs RM205
and RM220 respectively.
  Dr Fernandez said the council viewed with concern the danger posed by
the foreign workers, especially those who entered illegally as the latter
were not subject to any health screening tests.
  "If left unchecked, it can turn into a national security problem.
  "Nobody knows the exact number of the illegals, so the magnitude of the
problem could be far worse.
  "We fear we will reach a stage where diseases like malaria and
tuberculosis can be easily contracted by, or passed to, the public."

Picture perfect: Caring for the camera

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Zahari Zakaria

BESIDES picture-taking accessories, a complete photographic outfit should
contain a range of accessories for maintaining and repairing equipment.
  Like any equipment, cameras and lenses need a certain amount of
attention if they are to continue functioning accurately.
  Heavy use, particulary on location, inevitably causes wear and tear, and
certain moving parts, optical surfaces and integrated circuitry are
sufficiently delicate to be affected by dirt, moisture, heat and cold.
  The basic maintenance programmes consist of care in use, regular
cleaning and regular checks of major systems. In addition, damage may be
repaired by the user, although this should be approached with caution.
  Regular checking of all camera functions is an important precaution.
Familiarity with the sound, feel and appearance of the mechanisms makes it
easier to identify potential faults and can be an aid to repair. A good
occasion is when the camera is empty.
  There are, in most cameras, five major systems in the camera body -
shutter, wind-on, mirror box, viewfinder and metering, and three in the
lens - focusing, aperture diaphragm and aperture lingkage.
  The slower speeds of the shutter can be checked visually by opening the
camera back, holding the camera to the light and triggering the shutter
from its slowest speed to its highest.
  Speeds of about half a second and longer can be timed, while
progressively reducing the speed-setting makes it possible to judge speeds
even to about 1/125 second, as each should appear to be about one half the
duration of the previous one. Faster speeds cannot be reliably assessed by
the eye.
  The winding mechanism should feel and sound smooth and an additional
check is to watch the movement of the film leader when a new cassette is
installed. In use, the rewind lever on a 35mm single lens reflex will
move, although not necessarily each time the film is moved on.
  The mirror operation in a single lens reflex can be checked from the
front with the lens removed, both during normal operation and by moving
the mirror lock-up lever fitted to some models.
  Any significant problems in the viewfinder system will be immediately
obvious, but the seating of the viewing screen should be checked by
inspection.
  Any optical faults in the viewfinder which might affect accurate
focusing can also be checked by opening the shutter and the camera back,
fitting a lens and focusing an image on a piece of tracing paper held
against the open shutter.
  This should compare with the focus as seen through the viewfinder. The
best immediate check of the metering system is to compare it against
readings from at least one other meter.
  Two likely lens-focusing faults are a slack mechanism and lateral
movements, and both can occur through extended wear and tear.
  The first can be checked by holding the lens face down and watching it
to see if the focusing bow slips down under its own weight.
  Lateral movement can be seen through the viewfinder while shifting the
focus; it does not effect the recorded image but is distracting.
  The aperture diaphragm should be checked visually, with the lens both on
and off the camera, for smooth operation and to make sure that it stops
down to the full range of apertures.
  Careful handling of photographic equipment under normal circumstances
can be vital to avoid later problems or damage. Both front and rear lens
surfaces, and the body aperture can be protected with caps and clear glass
filter.
  When carried, equipment should be packed carefully. In use, moving
controls like the cocking lever and the rewind lever should be operated
smoothly and without straining.
  In storage, tensioned parts, which include the shutter mechanism and the
full automatic diaphragm (FAD) should be left slack.
  Equipment should be regularly serviced by professionals. A well-used
camera, for instance, should be serviced at least once a year.

company's products. Though regular checking of all camera functions is an
important precaution, the equipment should be regularly serviced by
professionals.

By Farouk Aziz Peru

ONE of the kings of France was a vicious and cruel man. He loved torturing
his enemies to death and his favourite method was to wrap them up in
animal skin, let them escape and hunt them down with dogs, letting the
animals tear them to pieces.
  For all his cruelty, however, he was also fascinated by animals. He kept
an elephant, monkeys and bears. He had a tame lioness even, which he often
took with him as he travelled throughout his kingdom.
  His weirdness reached new heights when he asked the Abbot of Baigne, a
local cleric, to produce a concert using swine voices.
  The abbot (who was probably used to the king's nonsense) agreed and
asked for a sum of money which was immediately delivered to him.
  He gathered hogs of all ages and got them together under a tent. He kept
them under a cover of velvet and made an organ out of them.
  How?
  His "keys" to the organ were little spikes which pricked the hogs on
command. Apparently he delighted the king and his companions that day.
  About 400 years later, the instrument created by the abbot was adapted
by the inventor of the so-called Porco-Forte.
  This device, however, was a little different. The pigs were put in a
partitioned box and their tails projected through holes.
  With a keyboard mechanism, the tails were pinched to produce a
harmonious range of oinks.

HERE is a relaxation method for those who feel tense after a hard day's
work or at school. It may seem a little strange to do it at first but if
you keep at it, you'll find yourself more energetic and relaxed than ever
before:
  Do a little stretching before the exercise. Gently please! No bouncing
and forced stretching which can only heighten tension.
  Find a place free of interruptions. Loosen all clothing and remove
watches, belts and glasses.
  Lie down and close your eyes. Feel the heaviness in your body. Feel your
body melting into the ground. Breathe deeply. Again, no forced efforts.
Breathe as deeply as you possibly can.
  Keep this breathing up for another two minutes.
  Now curl your toes up as  tightly as possible. Hold to a count of five.
At that point release and relax. Feel the difference?
  Next, tense up the muscles in your lower legs like the feet, calves as
well as the toes. Count to five and release. Enjoy the feeling.
  Next, tense up the muscles in the upper as well as lower part of the
legs. When you feel the tension, tense them a little more. Count slowly to
five and release. As usual, enjoy the feeling.
  Then tense up the buttocks, lower back and abdomen. Hold for a count of
five and release.
  The upper torso such as the shoulders hold a lot more tension. When you
tense them, do so more than for the other parts of the body. Hold for a
count of five and release.
  Now, tense up your arms. Hold them for a count of five. Release and let
them hang loose at your side.
  Squeeze the muscles of your face like your jaw, cheeks and scalp. Hold
for a count of five and as usual, release. Feel the relaxation in every
part of your face. This exercise makes you look younger!
  Now tense your entire body, starting with your toes and working your way
up. Hold for a count of five. Now relax. Unwind. Release. Let go. Mentally
scan your body for any tense parts and relax that body part.
  Now count to five slowly. At the end of the count, open your eyes. Keep
up the practice and your sense of well-being will experience a dramatic
increase.

Towards more open education (HL)

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By A. Kathirasen; Noor Adzman Baharuddin

PENANG, Sun. - A more open education with stress on critical and creative
thinking, and the atmosphere to voice them, is needed for Malaysia to
progress in the information age, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim said today.
  He added that Malaysia could not afford a copycat mentality, especially
in the field of science and technology, if it wanted to progress and
compete in the global arena.
  "We need in Malaysia today an education which is open; where people can
voice their views, offer and accept criticism while being committed to
acquiring a diverse range of knowledge and skills.
  "We need to master new skills and disciplines to progress. A country
will not progress if its knowledge is copycat knowledge; if its
scientists, experts and knowledgeable persons simply copy what others have
said and done.
  "We must have innovative technology, creative minds and critical
thinking for society to progress."
  In this context, he said, it was also important to master the English
language.
  Anwar said this when launching the Penang Free School Foundation at the
PFS hall this afternoon. Also present were Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh
Tsu Koon, PFS Foundation chairman Tan Sri Mohd Sheriff Mohd Kassim, old
boys Tengku Datuk Ahmad Rithauddeen and Tan Sri Elyas Omar, and PFS
principal Mohd Ismail Ibramsa.
  "We want Malaysians to master Bahasa Malaysia. It is the national
language. But we also want Malaysians to master other languages,
especially English. While we maintain Bahasa Malaysia as our national
base, our attitude should be global. This means better mastery of
English."
  He said many Malaysians wanted to learn various languages. Mandarin, for
instance, was now being encouraged as it had potential to be a language of
the economy. More people were picking up Tamil too, just as an increasing
number are learning Japanese, French and German, he added.
  "Mastery of other languages would not obstruct the usage of Bahasa
Malaysia or result in the sacrifice of Bahasa Malaysia. We are promoting
English after being satisfied and convinced that the promotion of Bahasa
Malaysia will proceed undisturbed at a greater pace."
  He said the country could progress only if it pursued a more open policy
and encouraged the mastery of English and other languages so that more
knowledge could be derived from the mastery of these languages and used in
taking the country to greater heights.
  The Finance Minister said while academic excellence was important, it
should not be at the expense of the creation of a wholesome adult and the
inculcation of moral and religious ideas.
  "At present there is too much stress on our schoolchildren. Parents
appear obsessed with academic excellence - at the expense of the birth of
a wholesome man.
  "I do not deny that Malaysia needs academic excellence - that we need to
master new disciplines - but it should not stop there. Emphasis should be
placed on morality. Critical and creative thinking should be our goal too.
  "How can we progress if the thinking habit is absent, the love of
scholarship is not there?" he added.
  Anwar also reminded Malaysians of the need to temper material goals with
moral goals, adding: "There is excessive and unbridled individualism today
in our country. This has caused the downfall of many civilisations in the
past. If the motivation is materialistic and individualistic, we will be
in trouble. And that is why wholesome education is needed."
  The Deputy Prime Minister praised PFS, the oldest English school in the
Asean region, for coming up with the foundation and suggested that the
board prepare a list of all successful old boys and get them to contribute
to its fund.
  The foundation is a charitable organisation to raise and donate funds
for upgrading and improving the school and to carry out activities in the
interest of the school. Mohd Sheriff, who is also chief executive officer
of Khazanah Holdings, hopes to set up a RM5 million trust fund.
  Anwar later received RM494,000 in donations from various groups,
organisations and companies including RM375,000 from the Kuala Lumpur and
Selangor PFS old boys association headed by Mohd Sheriff, RM100,000 from
old boy Datuk Md Zain Yusof and his relatives and friends, RM34,000 from
PFS, and RM11,000 from Elyas.
  Earlier in Prai, Anwar urged politicians and community leaders to
encourage more youths to participate in team sports and recreational
activities.
  He said by doing so, they would not idle their time away, and could put
to good use their youth and strength towards racial harmony and nation-
building.
  "Let's stop nagging them on what they should do with their youth.
  "Instead, provide useful programmes and activities such as canoeing,
hill-climbing, jet-skiing and the various games and sports to them so that
they can participate actively as a team.
  "Also, don't just provide them with the programmes and activities that
can be participated by all, but we must also join them so that they can
fully understand why we are encouraging them to do so," he said after
participating in an eight-km canoeing competition along Sungai Prai, from
Titi Timbul in Sungai Dua to the Seberang Prai Municipal Council
recreational park in Ampang Jajar.
  It was organised by the State Youth and Sports Department to promote
Sungai Prai and the Ampang Jajar recreational park as a major watersports
centre in Seberang Prai.
  Also taking part among the 400 participants were Chief Minister Tan Sri
Dr Koh Tsu Koon, his deputy, Datuk Mohd Shariff Omar, State Land,
Entrepreneur and Co-operative Development Committee chairman Abdul Latiff
Mirasa and several State Assemblymen.
  Anwar also reminded schools against being too obsessed with achieving
academic excellence that they neglect or downplay the importance of sports
and athletics.
  Earlier when launching a cleanliness campaign in Jalan Tuna here, Anwar
said the Government would not budge from its policy in requiring housing
developers to build low-cost houses in their schemes.
  "We have to insist that they comply with the requirement (of building
low-cost houses in their schemes) since this is the only way to ensure the
poor can enjoy affordable housing," he said.
  More than 200 flat-dwellers took part in a gotong-royong, held in
conjunction with the ceremony.
  He also urged all developers to fully understand why it was necessary
for them to assist the Government in providing ample affordable housing
for the people.
  Anwar also took to task some residents, especially flat-dwellers, who
refused to participate in cleanliness campaigns organised in their
neighbourhoods.
  "It is for the good of all. Gotong royongs help ensure your surroundings
are clean besides fostering closer relationship among neighbours," he
said.
  Later, when witnessing the sale of 8.4ha land, valued at RM6.5 million,
belonging to the Sungai Pelet area farmers' organisation to JKP Sdn Bhd in
Penanti, Anwar praised the organisation for its efforts to venture into
non-agricultural activities which could bring bigger returns for its
members.
  JKP Sdn Bhd, a company formed by the State Bumiputera Steering and Co-
ordination Committee, plans to carry out a RM40 million mixed development
project on the land.
  The company was represented by its managing director Dr Zulkifli Hassan
while the organisation was represented by its chairman, Adnan Ramli.
  At the same function, Adnan announced the organisation's purchase of 20
shophouses in Taman Sama Gagah, costing RM6.9 million, from Permatang Pauh
Realty Sdn Bhd.

Klang heartbeat: Motorcycle thefts getting serious

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Annie Freeda Cruez

THEFTS of motorcycles are becoming a serious problem in Klang especially
with at least 150 of them being reported stolen every month for the past
few months.
  Strangely, there are many who are not reporting the theft of their
machines  to the police in the hope that they would recover their
motorcycles or for reasons only known to them.
  Klang district police chief Assistant Commissioner Aziz Ariarasa
Abdullah strongly feels thefts of motorcycles can be prevented if owners
are more responsible and take proper security measures.
  He said many of the motorcycles are stolen when the owners leave their
machines unattended with the keys still in the ignition, not properly
locked or in places known for such thefts.
  "There were even instances when thieves rode away with motorcycles after
the owners left their machines running while going into a shop to get
something," he said.
  "If people are more careful, many of the motorcycles would not have been
stolen."
  He said the public should take the initiative to protect and safeguard
their property.
  He said motorcycle thefts could be reduced only with the co-operation of
the owners who had to ensure their machines were always locked up
properly, possibly with additional security locks.
  Motorcycle thefts have been reportedly high at Kampung Delek, Berkeley
Garden, Taman Sentosa, Jalan Meru, Jalan Kapar, Bandar Sultan Sulaiman,
Jalan Kem and Taman Sri Muda.
  Most of these bikes, especially the brand RXZ Yamaha, were reported
stolen near flats and shopping complexes in the district.
  Aziz said the recovery rate of stolen motorcycles per month was about 15
to 20 per cent with many of them found abandoned along road sides and
recovered during police operations.
  Recently, police arrested eight youths aged between 15 and 20 years,
mostly school dropouts and recovered from them eight stolen motorcycles.
  "People steal motorcycles for joyrides, transportation, to resell them
for cheaper price or to cannibalise and sell to illegal racers," said
Aziz.
  He said many of those who steal motorcycles for joy-rides were
schoolchildren and youths.
  Aziz said it would surprise many that there were even people who
"borrow" motorcycles as a means of transport to take them to a particular
place where on reaching they abandoned the machines.
  "Those who actually steal them are groups of youths usually school
dropouts who sell them at a cheaper price to unsuspecting buyers in
estates and Felda schemes or cannibalise the parts to sell to illegal
racers to make quick money," he added.
  So far this year, Aziz said, the police had picked up eight such groups
or in police jargon "pocket groups" with each group comprising between
three and seven people, and recovered several stolen motorcycles.

Many candidates seeking clarifications on functions

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

PENANG, Sun. - Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
he was getting letters from Umno Ministers and leaders contesting for
posts in the October party elections, seeking clarification on functions
they could attend following the ban on election campaigning.
   Speaking in his capacity as Umno disciplinary committee chairman, he
said: "Several of them have written to me seeking my advice on certain
programmes that they were slotted to attend. I have cleared some
programmes and disapproved some programmes."
  He was asked on the fact that many Umno Ministers were not attending
even official functions following the directive of the Umno supreme
council that they should not attend functions which could be construed as
campaigning.

City sidewalks: Ugly attitude of urban indifference

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Balan Moses

CONSIDER this assumption: As a nation develops and people become more
sophisticated and knowledgeable with better education, civic consciousness
should be heightened.
  Right-thinking people will probably rationalise this as being logical
and, therefore, theoretically quite probable.
  But does this actually happen in Malaysia, or closer home, in Kuala
Lumppur today?
  Let's look at the facts. Between January and July this year, City Hall
collected RM6 million in fines and compound penalties from a total of
228,042 notices issued to the public.
  This is RM400,000 more than what was collected for the same period last
year. Are city folk regressing as far as civic responsibilities are
concerned?   Facts, invariably cold and bare, give an accurate picture.
They are neutral and do not lie.
  What then ails city folk that they end up paying so much to the
authorities in fines and compounds for civic infringements?
  As Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said on Saturday (see story
on Page 23), the figures show that some city folk are not interested in
observing the law.
  Lamenting on the increase in fines and compounds, he said it was not a
good sign of the times.
  More received compound notices for not paying metered parking charges in
the first seven months this year compared with the same period last year.
  They paid a total of RM2,792,175 to City Hall for the period this year
for the offence.
  The local authority collected RM1,267,130 from hawkers for a variety of
offences while traffic offences brought in RM1,220,480.
  Other offences that brought in substantial amounts in fines were
committed under the Earthworks By-Laws 1988, Parks By-Laws 1981, Streets,
Drainage and Building Act 1974 and the Collection, Disposal and Management
of Garbage By-Laws FT 1981.
  Why this indifference among city folk to rules and regulations?
  A critical look around will show that indifference to rules are not the
only thing city folk are guilty of.
  Many are also indifferent to fellow Malaysians and in some cases, their
neighbours.
  Granted that there is an equal number or more of caring Malaysians who
always rise to the occasion when it comes to caring for others, the ugly
Malaysian syndrome and the number of people subscribing to it is
frightening.
  Why do people dump rubbish along roads and in front of their neighbours'
homes? Why do people wantonly dirty public toilets?
  Why have more road bullies surfaced recently? Some men have even taken
to assaulting women drivers, something unheard of before.
  Why do drivers end up in fist fights over trivial issues like cutting
lanes or blaring the horn?
  The Press has also reported recent cases of people standing by while
robberies were being committed.
  The environment, especially green lungs and forests, are also becoming
victims of indifference. Some businessmen are beginning to think that a
concrete jungle and the almighty ringgit are what life should be all
about.
  They do not have time to stop and smell the flowers.
  Something needs to be done to check this rot before it is too late and
such abberant behaviour becomes an accepted part of Malaysian culture.
  City folk have to sit up and ask themselves if indifference is what they
want to leave behind as a legacy to their children.
  We, as a society, will suffer if this becomes a reality.
  The authorities also have a role to play in helping Malaysians become
more caring and responsible.
  The young should be taught the need to help and care for one another,
regardless of their station in life. After all, this is what community
living is all about.
  Religious education, regardless of the faith, will go a long way in
inculcating civic consciousness among people.
  In the final analysis, however, change has to come from within. City
folk, and others, should give their best in making Kuala Lumpur and the
nation a better place to live in.
  * Sometimes, the most obvious things are the last seen. And so it may
have been in the case of the city-above-the-river Kuala Lumpur Linear City
(KLLC) project.
  The river and its reserve were there waiting when some developers were
busy cutting trees and hills for projects.
  We could have saved some of our natural heritage if the project had been
proposed earlier.
  The KLLC, to be built over the Sungai Klang, will result in a deeper and
wider Sungai Klang besides a squatter-free environment along the river
which will ensure a less polluted waterway.
  The People-mover Rapid Transit system which runs alongside the river is
another benefit accruing from the project.
  The mega-project itself will cover 117.6ha over a 12km route along the
river.
  It will stretch above and along the Sungai Klang between the Jalan Tun
Razak bridge at the upstream and the Jalan Klang Lama bridge downstream.
  It will have offices, entertainment centres, restaurants, hotels,
medical centres and apartments on arch frames over the river.
  While the benefits cannot be denied by way of more space for
development, the authorities also have to ensure that the project is
environment-friendly.
  This means that they have to ensure that the quality of river water is
not affected by the project.
  At a time when many children have not seen cows or goats save for what
is shown on television or in movies, we hope they will not forget what a
river looks like.
  We hope there will still be something of the river to see when the
project is completed. With the deepening and widening of the river, we
also hope it will lose its ugly brown hue for a healthy colour.
  It is left to be seen if the KLLC will spawn similar projects over other
rivers in the city.
  Some have raised the question of whether the project is violating the
guidelines of the Drainage and Irrigation Department.
  The authorities have to provide acceptable answers to such questions.

Town Planning head to perform duties of council secretary

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

KOTA BARU, Sun. - The Kota Baru Municipal Council has appointed its Town
Planning Division chief Kamaruddin Mamat to take over the duties of the
council secretary.
  Its president Hassan Abdullah said the appointment which was approved by
councillors at the special full council meeting today took effect
immediately.
  He added Kamaruddin was asked to perform the duties because MPKB did not
recognise the appointment of Shokri Mohamed.
  The council and the State Civil Service Commission are facing a standoff
following the council's rejection of Mohd Aiseri Alias to the post of MPKB
deputy president and Shokri as secretary.
  Hassan said MPKB had nothing against the two officers but did not
recognise their appointment by the commission because they were not made
according to procedures.
  Under service circular 5/1989, appointment to the two posts can only be
made upon the council's request. However, Hassan had said that the
commission did not refer the matter to him before making the appointment.
  However, he added, the council would not ask the two to leave or vacate
their posts.
  "I have no plans to take any action against the two but would appreciate
it very much if the commission withdrew the appointment," he said after
chairing the meeting.
  Hassan also did not rule out the possibility of the council filling the
posts with officers of their own choice.
  "If we do appoint our own people to fill the two posts, they would have
to be appointed by the State Exco," he added.

Feedback: Letter: Towards a better bus service

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By A Regular Commuter

ON taking over the Sri Jaya operated bus service 244 (Klang bus stand-
Bandar Utama through Pusat Bandar, Damansara Utama, Damansara Jaya and
Taman Tun) recently, Intrakota has redesignated the route as 21C.
  In addition, it has renamed Service 21 as 21A, and introduced 21B to Lot
10, giving all three services a common path between Bandar Utama and Bank
Negara.
  Unfortunately, the rather pale yellow dot-matrix numbers on a light
black, often greyish black, background becomes readable only when the bus
is almost upon one.
  Is it possible for Intrakota, which no doubt has the interests of both
commuter and driver at heart, to have the numbers boldly displayed as Sri
Jaya did?
  Would it also be possible for Intrakota to make available the schedule
of buses on this route so that, while allowing for the time of day and
uncertain traffic conditions, one can attempt to minimise waiting time?
  Can it be possible as well to have this information displayed at the
terminals at least for the benefit of all?
  When, for example, does the first bus leave either end of the route in
the morning and when does the last bus do likewise?
  Now that commuters can only board the bus one at a time - and at
terminals when the bus is ready to move - should not steps be taken to
inculcate the habit of queueing?
  For example, during the initial days, a security guard could be
stationed at the Klang bus stand during peak hours to ensure commuters
wait in line.
  In the mornings and evenings and during peak periods, one only has to
see the rush to board buses at the Klang bus stand to realise how
immeasurably advantageous it would be for all concerned - young and old,
men and women, drivers and management alike - to have such a system
enforced.
  Despite its many idiosyncrasies, Service 244 was predictable. Regular
commuters would undoubtedly in due course have the information to manage
their commuting but at this stage of Intrakota's takeover, the company
should make such information more widely available.

By Joe and family

WE are an elderly couple who have been staying alone in a TOL home at Loop
Road, Seremban for some 30 years now.
  Often our house and nearby homes get flooded when a nearby river
overflows during heavy rain.
  Although some digging at the river was done sometime ago, the situation
has not improved.
  On Sept 2 at 3.30am, flood waters entered our home and there was not
much we could do as the flood waters damaged our carpets and furniture.
  We aren't against development but such things should not mean that we
suffer as a result of it.
  We are appealing to our State Assemblyman and MP to please look into
this and help us improve the situation here.
  The Menteri Besar has promised titles to this place during the last
elections but nothing has come about so far.

Penang takes court action against 10 for polluting rivers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

By K. Suthakar

PENANG, Sun. - The Penang Water Authority has initiated legal action
against 10 private landowners for allegedly polluting rivers in water
catchment areas.
  The charges included that of diverting water flow illegally.
  A source said some of the cases were being heard while others were in
the pre-trial process.
  The action is being taken following the gazetting of all rivers as
catchment areas in April 1994 under the Penang Water Authority Enactment
1972.
  The cases included development which had polluted rivers as early as
1991.
  The source said this when commenting on a recent New Straits Times
report that pollution resulting from encroachment into catchment areas by
developers was threatening the quality of water supply in the State.
  The report quoted State Infrastructure Facilities, Transportation and
Telecommunications Committee chairman Datuk Dr Hilmi Yahaya as saying that
the water authority had detected mud and E. Coli in the raw water supplied
to water treatment plants.
  He was also reported to have said the State Government had yet to
gazette land around the rivers as catchment areas "due to limitations in
the law".
  The source said three catchment areas on the island - at Teluk Bahang,
Sungai Pinang and Air Itam - were facing serious water pollution problems
caused by encroachment.
  Private landowners who have put up structures to tap the potential of
eco-tourism have been blamed for this state of affairs.
  "We have detected toilets built near rivers and some people diverting a
stream to create a `private reservoir' for water durian trees.
  "We have also detected a bungalow in the catchment area. The Penang
Island Municipal Council had removed the roof as it was an illegal
building, but the owner has since put up a new roof," the source said.
  The source also said the water authority had taken a developer in Teluk
Bahang to court two years ago for allegedly polluting a river from
hillslope cutting activity. The case is pending.
  Meanwhile, Penang Housing Developers Association chairman Datuk Eddy
Choong said the authorities should allow owners of land within catchment
areas to develop their property. However, he advocated conditions such as
a minimum distance from rivers to ensure pollution was averted.

Feedback: Letter: `Killer' Seremban junction

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By G. Tarlochan Singh Gill

LOOP Road in Seremban and its surrounding areas have seen much improvement
lately with the upgrading of roads, the new Sungai Senawang, construction
of new bridges and overall renewal of Tenaga cables.
  Thanks to efforts undertaken by wakil rakyat Goh Siow Huat and Datuk
Wong See Wah, who have visited the areas frequently.
  Furthermore, another Bailey Bridge has been completed and was officially
opened on Sept 8, to the relief of many residents of Kampung Semarak and
surrounding areas whose schoolgoing children now have a proper access to
go to the Jalan Loop schools, and the working class group.
  However, attention has not been given to the "killer junction" (picture
above) at the trunk road which leads to Taman Rasah Jaya, Taman Thivy
Jaya, Taman Blossom Park, Taman Blossom Heights and the many housing
estates which have sprung up in the area over the years.
  Even southbound traffic ply this road to get to Port Dickson and Kuala
Lumpur via the south toll plaza.
  As a result of the heavy traffic, there have been many accidents at the
spot.
  Recalling an incident, a motorcyclist was dragged to his death some 200
metres while coming out from Taman Ujong and colliding with a car coming
downslope towards the town from Rasah Jaya. Months later, a pasar malam
operator was dragged similarly along this stretch.
  Since then, there have been more accidents, including fatal ones.
  It is advisable to have traffic lights controlling the Taman Ujong and
Taman  Blossom Park traffic flow, possibly also with a new approach route
to Taman Ujong at the upper section for oncoming traffic.
  Residents staying nearby are so used to the sounds of "bangs" that they
would quickly quip satu lagi, meaning one more accident, when they hear
one.
  The accidents at the nearby Rahang overhead railway bridge and Jalan
Tampin-Jalan Tuanku Antah junction have also kept the Seremban traffic
police very busy, especially during weekends.
  Since this falls under the Seremban Municipal Council's traffic
committee, it is hoped the committee will act promptly before more lives
are lost.

Feedback: Letter: One lane access problem

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Wife of Agitated Driver

PLEASE do something about the one lane going in and out of Plaza Phoenix,
Km 10.4 Cheras.
  The junction is the only access to 14 housing estates in the area.
  In addition to the one lane problem, there is also a big hole at the
junction, adding to the massive congestion which lasts throughout the day.
  Two-way lanes have been turned into one lane. It would not surprise me
if accidents were to occur and even result in lives lost as motorists
using the lane to get to work or return home are getting very impatient.
  Can someone do something about this? Just getting out of this place
during peak hours to the main road in Cheras takes almost half an hour.
  Think of the precious time wasted. And even in town, we have to face the
crazy traffic situation.
  I know that jams are everywhere. But residents in Cheras have been
putting up with traffic jams for quite some time.

Concert in honour of Tamil poet

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

THE Temple of Fine Arts Malaysia will stage a Sangeetha Nruthya Nataka
Upanyaasam entitled Krishnaarpanam at the PJ Civic Centre on Thursday.
  The programme celebrates Shri Oothakkadu Venkatasubbier's selected
inspired outpourings.
  This is the first time a concert in recognition of the poet is being
attempted in the country although most Carnatic music lovers here are
familiar with the Shri Thyagaraja's compositions.
  Venkatasubbier was a poet, musician-cum-saint who lived 350 years ago in
the Tanjor district of South India, dedicating his life to Krishna.
  Many of his pieces such as Alai Paayuthey, Paal Vaadiyum and Aadathu
Assangathu are popular pieces to those who appreciate Tamil poetry.
  Most lovers of Carnatic music and the bharatanatyam dance form are
familiar with his immortal composition Taye Yasodha.
  Many of Vekatasubbier's compositions are a delight to dancers because
the percussion sounds are rhythmic in character.
  TFA's music department director Suresh Ramachandran said the
presentation of song and music would follow the traditional Nadopasana
style of Vadya Gita Brindam or a vocal and instrumental ensemble.
  The 50-member ensemble includes instruments like the veena, violin,
flute, harmonium and mridangam.
  "Adding to this and giving visual imagery to the saint's inspiration is
an exposition of Abhinayam and Nrittam by our dancers," he said.
  "To enable the younger generation to appreciate the programme, we have
decided to explain and compere the evening both in English and Tamil."
  The programme will see the presentation of seven numbers.
  Admission is by invitation and enquiries can be made by calling 03-
2743709.
  TFA has also made an appeal to members of the public to sponsor the
souvenir programme, promised to be a quality publication with translations
and transliterations in English and Tamil.

Stipe's report: Maszeli suspended three days

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 43

APPRENTICE Maszeli Amin pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding and
was suspended three day by the Stipendiary Stewards yesterday. He was
astride Allez Allez III in Race 6.
  The Stipe's report is as follows:
  RACE 1: Park Lane III (S Sam), Vietnam Ranger (A John) and Caro Lad (I
Azhar) which were difficult to be boxed, will each be required to pass one
starting stall test prior to them being declared to race again. Inside the
final 100m, Caro Lad drifted out under pressure, causing Bendemus to
steady. Jockey I Azhar was warned to make more attempt to keep his mount
on a straight course in future.
  RACE 2: Near the 300m, Aspen Gold (App M Zaini) was steadied when
Fullmarks (I Azhar) was carried inwards by Pay Me Cash (A John) which
shifted in.
  RACE 3: Soviet Wonder drifted outwards in the closing stages of the race
carrying Mega Gold (WH Lao). Jockey WH Lao (Mega Gold), placed second,
lodged an Objection against Soviet Wonder, being declared the winner, on
grounds of interference in the last 200m of the race. After considering
all of the evidence, the Race Meeting Stewards were of the opinion that
the incident had not affected the result and the Objection was overruled.
The result stood and Jockey Lao's deposit was refunded.
  App SH Lee was warned to make more attempt to keep his mount on a
straight course in future.
  RACE 4: Acting on veterinary advice that Haramoun (J Saimee) was
coughing, the Race Meeting Stewards ordered its withdrawal. Jockey SY
Leong, the rider of Gleam, reported that this horse did not act in the
going.
  RACE 5: Trainer D Baertschiger was fined $50 for failing to produce the
correct colours on Silently Yours.
  Near the 600m, Bellotto Glory (KL Oo) was steadied to avoid the heels of
Jade Princess II (SH Oh).
  RACE 6: Rounding the 800m turn, Dear Sir and Brown Sugar were both
checked when tightened between Treasure Dragon (App T Ong) which was
hanging out and Allez Allez III (App M Maszeli) which shifted in. This
incident also resulted in Track Lark II having to be steadied. At a
subsequent Inquiry, App Maszeli, in the presence of his master, Trainer D
Dragon, pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding under MRA Rule 149
(a) (ii) in that he allowed his horse, Allez Allez III, to shift in on the
turn at the 800m mark causing varying degrees of interference to Brown
Sugar and Dear Sir. The Panel took into account mitigating circumstances
and suspended App Maszeli from riding in three race days with effect from
Mon, 16 Sep 96. He was advised of his Right of Appeal.
  Near the 100m, Jockey SH Oh the rider of Valid dropped his whip when
attempting to straighten the horse who had a tendency to lay in. He
pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding under Rule 149 (a)(ii) and
fined $500. He was informed of his Right of Appeal.
  RACE 7: Approaching the 1100m, mark Charming Star (V Sivan) began to
buck repeatedly losing some ground. Charming Star will be required to pass
a 100m, gallop trial from the barrier and veterinary examination.
  Trainer JF Heng was questioned about the apparent reversal of form of
King Of Hearts II (WH Au-Yeung). He explained that this horse had returned
from a break prior to which he had problems with its off-fore hoof.
  RACE 8: Rounding the home turn, Martina (App B Tai) when racing tight on
the inside of Because Of You II (KL Oh) steadied and then stumbled
dislodging App B Tai. Game Of Bridge (SH Oh), Showgirl VIII and Sparrow
Hawk had to take evasive action losing some ground. Shortly after this
incident, High Colours stumbled over the fallen rider, App Tai, dislodging
App SH Lee. Wings Of Freedom (L Cropp) and Air Jumbo had to take evasive
action losing some ground.
  App Tai was taken to hospital for observation and a statement concerning
the fall will be taken from App Tai when he is available.
  RACE 9: Approaching the 300m mark, Sunway was held up for a run on the
inside when Dingsheng (M Narredu) drifted inwards. Jockey KK Loh was
questioned regarding his ride on Sunway in the early part of the race. He
advised the Panel that his instructions were to settle the horse in mid
field but he found that the pace was too fast and he ended up further back
than he had wished.
  RACE 10: Shortly, after the start, Raphael Gold (M Narredu) was
tightened when Yes It's True (P Carbery) and Jiwa Jiwa (TM Wan) both
shifted ground. Linford (J Saimee) was also tightened when River Palace
(KL Oo), and My Encore (L Cropp) both shifted ground.
  An investigation will be opened into the running and handling of
Chattaronga II (CH Chua).

Palm oil

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

CRUDE palm oil physicals ended sharply lower the week in moderately active
trading, in line with the weaker CPO futures contract and uncertainty in
the Chicago market.
  Talks that palm oil production for end-August will be 15 percent firmer
over July contributed to a bearish sentiment on the cash market.
  Estimates by private crop forecaster Ivan Wong that end-August oil palm
production would increase by 11 percent to about 800,000 tonnes from July
while palm oil stocks to grow to 775,000 tonnes from the official figure
of 754,634 in July, however was factored in by the market.
  A lack of fresh leads and uncertainty over the market's trend in the
immediate and near term contributed to lacklustre trading on the cash
market.

Rubber

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

THE Malaysian rubber market closed mixed to lower last week in overall
quiet trading despite brokers regaining confidence to trade actively in
the market.
  The International RSS One buyer was unchanged from last Friday at 329.00
sen per kg while SMR 20 declined by one and a half sen to 314.00 sen per
kg.
  Improved buying interest from local traders and increased overseas
enquiries, had boosted prices Thursday.
  A dealer said there would be encouraging buying interest in the
immediate term, following traders' response to what they describe as
"comfortable" price levels.
  The market see-sawed in a tight range owing to the uncertainty in
regional markets and the lack of fresh factors.
  The International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) daily market
indicator price for Friday (September 12) was at 250.30
Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg.

Berita Harian-EON East-West Tour 1996.: Cycling.: Domingo dominates stage
five

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 44

By Zakri Baharudin

THE Philippines strengtened their lead in the overall team standings after
Enrique Domingo won the fifth stage of the Berita Harian-EON East-West
Tour from Taiping to Sungai Petani yesterday.
  Domingo's time of three hours 33:11.41 not only enabled his team to pull
away from the rest but it also allowed him to snatch the overall leader's
yellow jersey from teammate Victor Espiritu.
  Kuala Lumpur B's Wong Ah Thiam came in second in 3:34:57.12 while Harris
Fadzillah Osman of Kuala Lumpur B was third, a futher 56.71 seconds
behind.
  Domingo put up a strong performance and led the first breakaway 30km
after the starting line near Pondok Tanjung.
  He maintained his lead through the flat and narrow 140km stretch and
pulled away again with about a dozen other cyclists near Selama.
  "With this win, I have avenged our defeat in the first stage of the
Tour," said Domingo.
  "I knew that this stage was in the bag because as I got closer to the
end I could only see Wong trailing me," added the 26-year-old who works
for the Philippine Star daily.
  Philippines coach Bart Flores was glad that his cyclists adhered to his
orders.
  "My plan is working, especially now that the team are in a solid
position," said Flores.
  He added that it would be very difficult for any of the other teams to
win the overall championship at the end of the Tour in Langkawi.
  Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur A coach Ng Joo Ngan admitted that his strategy
didn't quite work out.
  "The Philippines are a strong team but I didn't expect them to break
away as early as in Kamunting," said Ng.
  All 86 riders will lineup at the Kuala Muda District Council office to
begin the 137km stage six from Sungai Petani to Alor Star today.
  RESULTS - 140km stage five from Taiping to Sungai Petani - Individual: 1
Enrique Domingo (Phi) 3hrs 33:11.41, 2 Wong Ah Thiam (KL B) 3:34:57.12, 3

Tin

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

TIN price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) settled the week 11 sen
lower at RM15.02 per kg from the previous Friday on overall higher
offerings and volatility on the London Metal Exchange (LME), dealers said.
  An overall drop of three-month tin on the LME by US$30 from last Friday,
resulted in sentiment being easier which sparked off a wave of
liquidations by miners.

Taking stock: Prestar may scale new highs in profit growth, turnover

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 34

By S. N. Lock

AS the KLSE second board continued on its unabated record-breaking surge,
some second board counters went about their consolidation while some
others were in a hurry to complete their base-building consolidation to
join in the superbull bandwagon.
  On Friday, some second board counters broke out of their recent lull and
maintained their technical composure while the second board underwent its
meaningful consolidation in late afternoon trade.
  Prestar Industries Bhd (Prestar) was one such counter that bucked the
KLSE SBI trend on Friday while Sin Kean Boon Group Bhd was the other.
  Prestar was incorporated under the Companies Act 1965 as a private
limited company on July 12, 1984 by some members of the Toh family.
Subsequently, it was converted into a public limited company on June 27,
1994 when it changed its corporate identity to its present form. The
change in its corporate identity was a move that prepared Prestar for its
listing on the KLSE second board.
  Prestar is principally involved in the manufacturing and trading of
wheelbarrows, building materials and material-handling equipment hardware
which includes hand-trucks, wheels and hot-dip galvanised overhead
transmission accessories and parts.
  The manufacturing set-up of Prestar was originally intended to
complement the marketing and trading services of YK Toh Marketing Sdn Bhd
which was involved in the importation and distribution of hardware,
building materials and material-handling equipment. The group later
diversified into the manufacturing of other related material-handling
equipment like hand-trucks and hot-dip galvanised products.
  Besides meeting the domestic demand for wheelbarrows, Prestar embarked
on an international marketing campaign and has successfully secured orders
from the United States of America, Japan and Middle East countries. With
the increasing domestic and export market demands, Prestar undertook an
expansion programme when it moved to its new factory in Rawang.
  In July 1995, Prestar subscribed to a 35 per cent equity stake in
Zelleco Metal Galvanising Sdn Bhd. The remaining stake in the joint
venture company was taken up by Selleco, a subsdiary of Malaysian
Resources Corporation Bhd. The joint venture company was formed to
undertake projects undertaken by MRCB-PNB Consortium.
  Chartwise, Prestar made its debut on the KLSE second board on Sept 20,
1995 when its shares were traded from an intra-day low of RM3.26 to an
intra-day high of RM3.62 before easing to close at the RM3.54 level with
913,000 shares changing hands.
  Immediately after its listing on the KLSE second board, its price trend
went sideways for the next 2 1/2 months before embarking on its first
upleg to RM7.45 on Jan 23, 1996. Prestar's price trend corrected down to
RM5.00 on Feb 13, 1996.
  A new uptrend unfolded immediately after its price trend reversed out of
its short consolidation. The feverish uptrend with the KLSE second board
run-ups sent its share prices to yet another all-time historical high of
RM10.60 on April 26, 1996.
  The ensuing second board corrections sent its price trend all the way
down to RM5.50 on June 3, 1996. A strong technical rebound to RM8.15 on
July 17, 1996 followed by a swift retreat to RM6.20 on July 30, 1996 set
the stage for its current uptrend breakout. Its share prices closed at
RM9.00 on Friday.
  Here are the readings of some of its technical indicators:-
  Moving Averages: Prestar's current prices continue to stay above all its
10-, 20-, 30-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages in their bullish
sequential order.
  Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index has since reversed to the
upside following its recent successful re-test of its neutral reference
line.
  On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV is firmly staying above its 10-day
exponential moving averages after moving sideways for four months.
  Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI staged a decisive breakout of its
immediate overhead resistance at the 65 per cent level.
  OUTLOOK:
  After establishing its market leadership in wheelbarrows, hand-trucks
and other material-handling equipment in the domestic market, Prestar is
on the move once again.
  Its joint venture with Selleco into a galvanising project for works
undertaken by MRCB-PNB Consortium and its venture into the manufacture of
steel guard rails (used mainly as road dividers) clearly signalled its
determined diversification into supplying projects related to
infrastructure development of the country.
  Apart from its diversification into infrastracture projects, Prestar
moved further upstream when it acquired a 70 per cent stake in Summit
Steel Service Centre Sdn Bhd. Summit Steel Service Centre Sdn Bhd sheers
steel into coils and supplies them to the steel industry, including metal
stamping companies.
  Its diversification exercise coupled with its domestic market leadership
in material-handling equipment will afford Prestar to scale newer highs,
both in terms of turnover and profit growth. This will continue to
underpin share prices.
  Technically, Prestar's decisive breakout of its immediate overhead
resistances (See Prestar's weekly bar chart - D3-D4 - and daily bar chart
- E1-E2) clearly signals a trend reversal to the upside. Its price trend
has successfully taken out the neckline (E1-E2) of its double-bottom
pattern formation.
  Its pattern measuring objective is likely to take Prestar's short- to
intermediate-term to stage a re-challange of its all-time historical peak
at the RM10.60 level.

Currency review: Currency review

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 34

THE greenback is poised to strengthen further against the ringgit in the
weeks ahead on the softening ringgit interest rate outlook. Although the
ringgit was steady against the greenback last week, we expect a declining
ringgit trend to commence soon. The greenback closed Friday at 2.4895,
unchanged from the week before.
  * THE Singapore dollar's recent rise took a turn downwards against the
ringgit last week. This was due to the unloading of Singapore dollars by
an institution last week. The Singapore dollar closed Friday at 1.7640,
down from 1.7700 the previous Friday. Although still on a medium term
bullish trend, the dollar's rise could continue to be checked this week.
  * THE Japanese yen continued to fall against the ringgit last week amid
expectations that the BoJ would maintain the yen's interest rate at its
historic low. This expectation was strengthened further when data on
Friday showed that Japan's second quarter gross domestic product shrank
0.7 per cent. The yen closed Friday at 2.2560, down from 2.2780 the week
before.
  * AFTER being boosted by the previous week's tension in the Middle East,
sterling pared its gains last week against the ringgit. The latest
economic figures show that the UK economy is growing steadily. This could
mean the end of further UK rate cuts and should be bullish for sterling in
the medium term. Sterling is not expected to rise just yet.
  * THE Australian dollar surged against the ringgit and other currencies
Monday on the expectation that global inflation would boost Australian
commodity prices. But the dollar weakened Thursday and Friday when the
central bank hinted that there was still room for lower Australian rates.
The Australian dollar closed Friday at 1.9750, from 1.9688 the previous
Friday. It is expected to be steady this week.

Technically speaking: KLCE CI's short-term trend shaping up well

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 32

By S. N. Lock

SHARE prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange closed broadly higher last
week. The bullish run-ups on the KLSE second board spilled over to some
second and third liners on the main board. Selective buying support on
blue-chips and index-linked counters underpinned the KLSE Composite Index.
  Persistent retail buying support chased KLSE second board counters on
Monday but blue-chips and index-linked counters continued to trade lower
amid lack of institutional support. In its earlier trading the CI dipped
to its intra-day low of 1,101.40 points before recovering to close at
1,104.28.
  The broader market ignored news that Malaysia's gross domestic product
was higher at 8.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year when compared
with 8.3 per cent the previous quarter. From the look of things, it was
expected and within the confines of some fund managers' forecasts.
  The KLSE Second Board Index cooled momentarily on Tuesday when its
advance was clipped 5.44 points, or 0.97 points, to 555.55 level. However,
the SBI managed to post an all-time intra-day high of 566.41 points in its
earlier trading
  Some investors switched from speculatives on the second board coupled
with some renewed buying from institutional investors sent the CI 7.47
points higher to 1,111.75 level on Tuesday. Many investors viewed the
second board as way overstretched and took profits accordingly. This
explained why the SBI suffered its first loss following four consecutive
daily upticks.
  Contrary to many investors' expections, the SBI reversed when retail
players resumed buying second board counters. Some second board counters
were marked up with triple-digit gains. There was talk that some fund
managers who missed the second board run-ups were waiting for the second
board bubble to burst before returning to invest in blue-chip stocks.
  While the second board continued with its unabated record-breaking run,
many analysts started to question the overvaluations on some second board
counters. On Friday, there were bouts of profit-taking pressure on second
board counters but bargain huntings managed to absorb the selling pressure
remarkably well.
  Reflecting the consolidation mood of the broader market, the CI managed
to put up a good show when it gained 12.22 points, or 1.10 per cent, to
close at 1,117.55 points on Friday. The KLSE All Share EMAS Index rose
4.28 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 324.20.
  The KLSE Industrial Index recovered 21 points, or one per cent, to
2,114.21 level. The SBI jumped 17.85 points, or 3.22 per cent, to 572.24
points.
  On the sectoral performance analysis, the property sector was the top
gainer with gains of 3.86 per cent followed by second board in second
place with a gain of 3.22 per cent. Elsewhere, all other remaining sectors
posted gains ranging from 0.26 per cent to 2.57 per cent.
  Chartwise, the CI recovered from its initial setback on Monday when it
staged a successful re-test of its 1,100 support.
  The next four trading sessions saw the strong buying support on blue-
chips counters. The following are readings of some of its technical
indicators:
  Moving Averages: The KLSE CI managed to recover above its 10-, 20-, 30-,
50- and 200-day moving averages while its 100-day moving averages
continued to hover.
  Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index moved out of its recent
falling field trend.
  On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV trend staged a re-penetration of
its 10-day exponential moving averages.
  Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI continued to trade within the
confines of its neutral zone.
  OUTLOOK:
  The KLSE CI successfully moved out of the upper two per cent standard
deviation band of its Keltner Channel. Similarly, it managed to break out
of its short-term downtrend (See KLSE CI's Daily Bar Chart - B3-B4). Both
of these technical scenarios suggest that the CI's short-term trend is
fast improving as it approaches its next bullish time window.
  From its weekly bar chart, the CI continued to stay within the gradual
upward path of its Andrews' Channel. Its immediate-term Andrews' Channel
provides glimpses of the CI's intermediate-term perspectives.
  The CI violated the Andrews' lower median line (See KLSE CI's weekly bar
chart - A5-A6) in November 1995, but was quickly vaulted back into the
channel, staying right below its median line (A1-A2). Once again, it
staged a successful re-test of the support of its lower median line (A5-
A6) on July 30, 1996.
  Thus, the CI's short- and intermediate-term perspectives are shaping up
very nicely as it approaches its next bullish time window. This week, the
CI is poised to take out its immediate overhead resistance at 1,123 point
level. Its next resistance zone hovers around 1,140-1,155 points.
  The SBI is poised to crack the 600 level this week amid intermittent
profit-taking. Rotational plays will once again feature prominently as the
SBI will continue to move along its uptrend channel (See KLSE SBI - C1-C2
and C3-C4).

Clean-up Day team clears up 620kg of rubbish

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

KLANG, Sun. - A car-seat, a baby-walker and motorcycle spare parts were
among the "treasures" collected at The Body Shop's Fifth Annual Coastal
Clean-Up at the esplanade, Port Klang, today.
  More than 100 participants from The Body Shop, Klang Municipal Council,
Klang Youth Council and Red Crescent societies from schools here scoured
the 1.5 kilometre esplanade for trash dumped by inconsiderate people.
  The total amount of trash collected weighed 621.20 kilogrammes.
  The clean-up was held in conjunction with International Coastal Clean-Up
Day which is co-ordinated by the Centre for Marine Conservation in
Atlanta, the United States.
  CMC is a non-governmental organisation which co-ordinates more than
200,000 volunteers in clean-up efforts around the world on the second
Sunday of every September.
  The Body Shop's public and media relations manager, Molly Fong, said it
initiated the first Malaysian clean-up in 1992 and had co-ordinated annual
clean-ups at different coastlines, including at Langkawi, Tioman and
Pantai Morib.
  Today's clean-up was launched at 9.30am by Sementa Assemblyman Datuk
Abdul Rahman Talil.
  Mina Foong, managing director of The Body Shop Malaysia, said the clean-
up was to single out the kinds of rubbish dumped indiscriminately.
  Participants recorded information about the trash collected on data
cards which will be sent to CMC. The information will be processed and
become part of CMC's annual International Coastal Clean-Up report.
  Foong said CMC would use the report to lobby Governments, the United
Nations and companies whose products were commonly found in coastal trash.

Using cards to pay toll by year 2000

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

By Mimi Syed Yusof

SUNGAI SIPUT, Sun. - Motorists in the Klang Valley will have to use
electronic cards for payment under the open toll system which will be
introduced in the year 2000, Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said.
  He said the central electronic toll collection system would reduce
manpower at toll stations.
  "The best option is to introduce electronic toll cards as a mode of
payment for motorists entering the Federal capital," he told reporters
after attending a badminton exhibition match yesterday.
  Samy Vellu said the proposal was submitted to the Cabinet at its meeting
last Wednesday.
  The move would ensure smooth toll collection as motorists need not queue
for long periods at toll booths.
  Under the system, motorists will have to purchase the electronic toll
cards.
  The Minister also said the Cabinet had requested his ministry to submit
a report on the system within two to three months.
  On the system, Samy Vellu said a central collection agency would be set
up to collect all toll payments via the electronic cards.
  The agency will then channel the payments to all the companies and
concessionaires of road projects.
  He said to date 12 road projects outside Kuala Lumpur had been approved.
  After the roads are completed there will be toll stations every three or
five kilometres along the roads leading to the city centre.
  "This means there will be about 200 toll stations around the Klang
Valley," he said, adding that several companies had recommended that an
intelligent system be implemented to facilitate toll collection.
  On whether Projeck Lebuhraya Utara Selatan would be included in the new
system, Samy Vellu said PLUS would be exempted because it dealt with long-
distance travelling based on the closed toll concept.
  "The focus is now on the toll collection system in Kuala Lumpur which
will include all the roads around the capital and from Kuala Lumpur to the
highways," he said.
  Also included are the Federal highway and roads from Kuala Lumpur-Shah
Alam, the integrated highway from Kuala Lumpur-Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang, Shah Alam-Putrajaya and KLIA, Jalan
Kuching to Kuala Lumpur and Shah Alam-Petaling Jaya.
  Another route is Jalan Cheras-Batu 7 Kajang which is connected to the
North-South Expressway.
  Samy Vellu said the system must be adopted because it was the best way
to collect toll from all the entry points of the city centre.
  He said the ministry would also hold discussions with consortiums of
road projects in preparing the proposal.
  He said six companies had started work on several toll stations and at
least two would start collecting toll when the roads are completed.
  He also said experts would be called in to study the situation and to
provide feedback.

`Ban Singaporeans from buying food'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

TAIPING, Sun. - The Federation of Malaysian Consumer Association wants the
Government to ban Singaporeans from taking any food items out of Johor
Baru.
  It has proposed that the Government check the car boots of Singaporeans
leaving Johor Baru for the purpose.
  Speaking at a press conference after a forum on current consumer issues
organised by the Consumer Association of Taiping held at a leading hotel
here, Fomca president Mohamed Hamdan said the move was aimed at protecting
consumers in Johor Baru.
  He said if the Singapore Government could have a half-tank policy to
check on the petrol tanks of cars entering the republic, then it was not
unreasonable for the Malaysian Government to check the car boots of
Singaporean motorists to prevent them from taking away food items.
  Mohamed Hamdan said as the country was not self-sufficient and importing
many essential food items like rice, flour, fish and chicken, it was
unfair for Singaporeans to be allowed to take away food items from
Malaysia.
  "How can we allow Singaporeans to take away our imported essential food
items," he said.
  Mohamed Hamdan also cited as an example how Malaysia was importing wheat
100 per cent.
  He added that the Singapore Government was imposing a lot of
restrictions on Malaysians entering the republic.
  Mohamed Hamdan said since food had become costly in Johor Baru, it was
wise for Malaysia to control the "re-exportation" of such items by non-
Malaysian individuals.

Hamdan: Open system a burden

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

IPOH, Sun. - The Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association president
Mohamed Hamdan Adnan said today the open toll system requiring motorists
who enter Kuala Lumpur to pay toll was a burden to consumers.
  He said consumers were currently burdened with many taxes, which
included paying the highway toll.
  He said the association would only support the system if the Government
ensured that the public transportation system and infrastructure
facilities within the Klang Valley were up to the mark.
  While agreeing that this would help reduce traffic congestion within the
city centre, Hamdan said without a proper public transportation system,
the open toll concept was inappropriate.
  He also said there were other ways to reduce city centre traffic
congestion such as moving activities from Kuala Lumpur to other parts of
Klang Valley.
  "Kuala Lumpur is congested because development is currently concentrated
there.
  "The Government should also consider other alternatives such as
organising activities outside the city and to put a stop to development
plans within Kuala Lumpur," he told reporters after giving a talk at the
Old Andersonian Club on current consumer issues.
  Hamdan also said the Government should not concentrate solely on
development within the city but that it should be balanced and spread out
evenly.
  He proposed that the Government set up townships outside the city
centre. He, however, said development of townships should not harm the
environment but should be properly planned so that it would complement the
outskirts of the city.
  "The Government should not burden the consumers by asking them to pay
without giving them an option," he said.

State aims to reduce number of poor families

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

By Sa'odah Elias

SABAK BERNAM, Sun. - The Selangor State Government aims to reduce the
number of poor families to less than one per cent of the State's
population before the end of the century.
  The number of families living below the poverty line in Selangor
currently stands at 2,302 or slightly over two per cent.
  Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib said besides direct help
and assistance, various programmes would be introduced to provide members
of these families with new skills to enable them to better their lives.
  "Through our concerted poverty eradication programme, we hope to reduce
the number of poor families in Selangor to below 1,000 by the year 2000.
  "With the help of the State Poverty Eradication Foundation, we are
confident of meeting this target," he said at a key presenting ceremony to
14 proud homeowners whose houses were built by YBK.
  Each of the two-bedroom houses built under the YBK Desa Kasih scheme in
Kampung Tebuk Pulai near here cost about RM20,000 which includes the value
of a piece of land measuring 15 by 21 metres.
  They were built for families in the district identified as being very
poor. Besides a house, each family was provided with 20 hydrophonic cases
to enable them to venture into hydrophonic farming.
  Muhammad said in the effort to eradicate poverty in Selangor, emphasis
would be placed on upgrading the skills of the people to enable them to be
independent and discourage them from expecting Government handouts.
  He said the programme, which also encompassed the poor in urban areas,
would be further intensified over the next few years to ensure their place
in the mainstream of development in the State.
  He said the rural poor would be supplied with new farming skills while
those in urban areas would be provided with business opportunities with
the setting up of stalls and hawker centres.
  YBK chairman Datuk Zainal Abidin Sakom said since 1991, the foundation
had provided monetary aid to 481 families living in Malay traditional
villages to repair or rebuild their houses under the Lindungan Kasih
scheme.

Gold cheaper by RM3 per gm due to price war

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

IPOH, Sun. - The price of the top three grades of gold is down by RM3 per
gramme after a price war between Federation of Malaysian Goldsmiths and
Jewellers' Association members and non-members.
  Perak branch chairman Y.M. Chong said the price reduction came about
after an emergency meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Sept 3.
  "We are doing this to stabilise the price of gold in the local market,"
he told a news conference today.
  He said about 200 members in the State had been advised to adhere to the
association's resolution although their profit margin could be cut to less
than five per cent.
  Chong said non-members were selling gold at a lower price and this was
seriously affecting the business.
  "In the past, it was up to 12 per cent but we are making a sacrifice to
alert consumers of what is happening in the industry," he said, adding
that the price was expected to go up early next year.
  He said the 999 (24 carat gold), which was sold at RM39 per gramme, was
now being sold at RM36, 916 (22 carat) from RM37 to RM34 and 835 (20
carat) from RM34 to RM31.
  Chong claimed many non-members sold gold to customers at a cheaper rate
but this was of inferior quality.
  "There are also goldsmiths who offer gifts like radios and cameras.
  "This could be a sales gimmick to sell off inferior quality gold," Chong
said.
  He said these errant goldsmiths refused to become members because they
had to adhere "to our strict business ethics, rules and regulations".
  "We self-regulate ourselves by investigating members if customers
complain they have been cheated or shortchanged by them," he said.
  He advised consumers to buy jewellery from reputable goldsmith outlets
who were also members of the federation.
  Chong said customers could not get good resale prices for their
jewellery if they bought inferior items.
  He said the standard rate was 18 per cent off the current gold market
price.
  Chong said the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry's
enforcement unit also periodically checked the outlets.

Hotel Equatorial opens doors in Ho Chi Minh City

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

By Shareem Amry in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

THE Hotel Equatorial chain was extended to seven locations when its latest
addition in Ho Chi Minh City officially opened its doors on Saturday.
  Owned by Singapore-based Planergo Pte Ltd, the RM87.5-million hotel was
opened by the acting chairman of Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Vo
Viet Thanh.
  Pembangunan Anika Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hotel Equatorial
(M) Sdn Bhd, is the biggest shareholder in Planergo with a 31 per cent
stake. Arab-Malaysian Development has 20 per cent, while Singapore's
NatSteel Properties Pte Ltd and Lim Kah Ngam (Investment) Pte Ltd hold
23.75 per cent and 20.25 per cent respectively.
  Vietnamese entrepreneur Phan Thanh holds the rest.
  Speaking after the launch, Planergo's executive chairman Datuk Lim Kong
Wai said:
  "We think things will improve here, especially since Vietnam established
relations with the Asean. We even upgraded the hotel because of our
confidence in Vietnam's economic reforms."
  The hotel now registers an occupancy rate of between 40 and 50 per cent.
  The chain extends to Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Singapore, Jakarta, Guangzhou
and Shanghai.

Golden Valley expects RM20m from sale of lots

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 30

GOLDEN Valley Golf Resort Bhd expects a return of RM20 million from the
sale of 180 bungalow lots at its course in Air Panas, Jasin, Malacca.
  Its executive director, Azman Abdul Ghani, said the 180 lots were 7,000
to 15,000 square feet in area and were being sold for between RM14 and
RM16 per square foot.
  "Those who had purchased these lots can choose from our 10 models of
bungalow houses. Our subsidiary company will construct them at a cost of
RM200,000 to RM500,000," he said.
  Azman added buyers would also get a free membership to the golf club
which is worth RM36,000.
  He told this to reporters after witnessing Chief Minister Datuk Seri
Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani launch the project on Saturday.
  The development of the bungalow lots is the second major project
undertaken by Golden Valley.
  Its previous project was a 27-hole golf course with a clubhouse, seminar
facilities, a karaoke lounge and a Japanese hot bath on 160ha.
  Azman said the company had spent RM8 million on the infrastructure for
developing the bungalow lots.
  He said owners who chose to let their houses could get assistance from a
Golden Valley subsidiary.
  Future projects for the company include the development of chalets and
220 service apartment units.
  "This project would be completed in five to eight years and we hope the
profit generated from this and our other projects would spur our drive to
become a listed company," Azman said.

Emerging companies: Company profile: Saujana sees lots of opportunities
waiting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 30

By Zuraimi Abdullah

AS suggested by the Malay word saujana, which is often associated with the
phrase sejauh mata memandang (as far as the eyes can see), Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange main board-bound Saujana Consolidated Bhd sees its days of
glory not within its grasp yet.
  "The horizon is endless, and so are the opportunities," managing
director Abu Bakar Mohamad Nor said during a recent interview.
  Although it has carved a niche for itself in the hotel and golf course
management business the company believes there is a lot more business
opportunities to be seized.
  Recalling the history of Saujana, Abu Bakar said it all began in the
early 1980s when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, after
returning from an overseas trip, instructed Peremba Group of Companies -
via the Urban Development Authority - to set up a company to manage hotel
cum golf resorts.
  "Peremba at that time was under UDA, and the Prime Minister who was in
his early years in office, had this vision. Thus, Saujana came into
existence.
  "Eventually, with the combination of expertise from three good partners
- Hyatt International, Peremba and Saujana itself - and after some
problems, we have grown to what we are today."
  Saujana now owns and operates the renowned Hyatt Regency Saujana Hotel
and Saujana Golf and Country Club, both in Subang Jaya, Selangor, and
develops and markets computerised information systems as well as sells
turf equipment to golf clubs.
  And more recently, it diversified into the property sector after
acquiring 30 per cent equity in developer PGK Sdn Bhd.
  Abu Bakar said Saujana was proud to have built the country's best golf
course at the Saujana Golf and Country Club. The 18-hole course had been
voted the best course by Golf Malaysia magazine in 1991, 1993 and 1995.
  He admitted Saujana had benefited much from its link with its parent
company, Peremba.
  The alliance with Hyatt was formed over eight years ago. The partnership
allayed Saujana's fears of stiff competition in the hotel and hospitality
industry.
  "When we mention the name Hyatt, the thing that crosses people's mind is
its five-star hotel. During the recession, when several hotels were coming
up in the Klang Valley, we still managed to record an occupancy rate above
75 per cent."
  Abu Bakar said Hyatt Regency enjoyed an average occupancy rate of 74 per
cent last year and 82 per cent for the first six months this year. This is
high when compared with the 66 per cent registered by other hotels in
Peninsular Malaysia.
  About 75 per cent of Hyatt Regency's customers are corporate and
business travellers and of this, about 65 per cent are repeat customers.
  Now after eight profitable years, Abu Bakar said Saujana wanted to
introduce the concept in other places in the country.
  "Future expansion will be geared towards synergistic growth consistent
with our core business."
  He foresees more golf courses will be built, providing greater business
opportunities for the company.
  "The best way to exploit this is to support them through full
utilisation of our Toro turf equipment and Club Car golf buggies. We have
already captured 70 per cent of the market share in turf equipment.
  "On top of that, we believe many local authorities are going to develop
parks and football fields and they still need our machinery.
  "Furthermore, many other hotels as well as airports need our products
like the buggies," he said, adding that Saujana is the sole distributor
for Toro products and the golf buggies.
  It also plans to increase its land bank, which stands at 7.6ha and
located close to Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International Airport in Subang.
The land was initially earmarked for the development of 569 units of
condominium.
  "Although the development of the condominiums has been approved, we will
still evaluate other proposals to maximise returns on investment and those
that complement our core business."
  Saujana is now scouting for land in Johor, Phuket in Thailand and Bali
in Indonesia for property development.
  "We are now talking to several parties. In Johor, we hope to secure
about 400 acres (160ha) of land. As for Phuket and Bali, we cannot say
much as the discussions are still at the preliminary stage," he said.
  Abu Bakar said Saujana, backed by expertise from Peremba and its
associated company PGK, was capable of undertaking any property
development.
  PGK is now developing Bandar Baru Wangsa Maju in Kuala Lumpur which is
expected to be completed in about 10 years.
  The company recently completed Phase Six of the project and to date has
recorded sales of about RM650 million.
  He ruled out the possibility that the property sector would supplant
Saujana's core business, saying that income from both sectors would
probably be the same in a few years.
  "In the next few years, our hotel business and property business each
will contribute 40 per cent to our revenue. The remaining 20 per cent will
come from our golf business."
  Currently, the core business contributes about 60 per cent of its income
and property 30 per cent.
  Saujana has forecast a pre-tax profit of RM15.76 million for the
financial year ending 1996. Last year, it made about RM11.18 million.

Electrolux aims for larger market share in Asean

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

By Noorzita Samad in Stockholm, Sweden

SWEDISH home appliances giant Electrolux AB aims to be among the top three
suppliers of washing machines, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners in Asean
by the year 2000.
  The target was set amidst its comprehensive plan to capture a larger
share in Asia's emerging consumer markets - traditionally dominated by
price-competitive products from Japan and to a lesser extent, South Korea.
  Apart from Asean countries, other potential markets in Asia identified
by Electrolux are China and India.
  And having set its goal to make further inroads into Asia, Electrolux
has consistently focused its efforts in developing products as well as
widening its investment in manufacturing operations in various Asian
nations.
  The group recently unveiled a new range of environmentally-friendly
products known as AlphaCare in Singapore.
  The new Electrolux washing machine, refrigerator, vacuum cleaner, built-
in oven and gas hob, and microwave oven will be launched in Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand next month.
  Its senior executive vice-president and chief financial officer Lennart
Ribohn said EIectrolux hoped the introduction of the AlphaCare range would
provide an impetus towards realising its goal of becoming tops in Asean.
  The group is aiming for a 20 per cent market share of washing machines
and a 10 per cent market share of refrigerators in Asean within the next
four years.
  It is estimated that by then, the washer market in Asean (excluding the
Philippines) will be worth about US$500 million (RM1.25 billion) and
refrigerator, almost US$1 billion.
  Ribohn said this to a group of journalists from Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong and China during a visit to Electrolux
global headquarters last week.
  The group also visited Electrolux-Zanussi factory in Pordenone, near
Venice in Italy; the group's vacuum cleaner factory, quality control and
testing facilities in Vastervik, about 280km from Stockholm; and,
Electrolux Home Centre and retail shops in Sweden's capital city.
  Ribohn said the group was now evaluating the feasibility of setting up
manufacturing facilities in the Asean region.
  Although he declined to disclose the possible locations and the
estimated investment for the ventures, Ribohn said the plants would
produce washing machines and refrigerators.
  They will likely be in the form of joint ventures with local partners,
with Electrolux maintaining the majority control.
  The deals are expected to be finalised by the end of this year, said
Ribohn, who also heads the new markets division which besides Asia also
includes Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Africa.
  Electrolux (Malaysia) Holdings Sdn Bhd deputy managing director S.N.
Soon was quoted as saying last month that the company planned to increase
its investment in Malaysia through the establishment of another factory.
  He said the company had yet to determine what to manufacture, adding
that the final plan would be decided by its Stockholm head office.
  Electrolux now has a vacuum cleaner factory in Shah Alam, Selangor.
  Electrolux is not a newcomer to the Malaysian market, having been around
since the 1970s. In fact, Electrolux is almost synonymous with vacuum
cleaners in Malaysia.
  But there is more to the group than just vacuum cleaners.
  It also produces other household appliances, commercial appliances and
outdoor and industrial products. It manufactures washing machines,
dishwashers, industrial-size laundry machines, lawn trimmers and
chainsaws, to name a few.
  Last year, sales reached 115.8 billion Swedish Kroners (RM45.16
billion).
  The group now manufactures appliances under a number of brand names of
companies which it had acquired over the years. In 1994, for instance, it
took over German appliance company AEG Hausgerate.
  It shifted to higher gear in its global expansion drive with the
acquisition of the famous Italian brand name, Zanussi, in 1984.
  Electrolux now has investments in more than 90 countries in commercial
appliances, industrial products and outdoor products.
  While its brands are tops in Europe and North America, sales in Asia
only contributed 5.1 per cent to the group's turnover last year.

AGENDA Istimewa Sdn Bhd, a member of the Gasing Heights group, will soon

bungalow lots, which breached RM120 million since the launch in July.
  Kesuma Lakes is a 548ha self-contained township comprising residential,
commercial and industrial development with facilities such as a private
college, four schools, a medical centre, police and fire stations.

Germany's Vega eyes Malaysian mart

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

GERMAN-BASED Vega AG, which produces unplasticised polyvinyl chloride
window and door systems, will join up with Malaysian companies to market
its products.
  "The companies will buy the (window and door) profiles from us as well
as the machinery for cutting the profiles. We hope to identify long-term
partners by the end of the year," regional manager (Asia Pacific) Lionel
Teng said in a statement.
  He added that the company had taken the first step towards regional
expansion by increasing the use of its softline system of window and door
profiles for the Asian market.
  "Veka is also seeking to consolidate its foothold in markets such as
Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.
  "To date, we have formed strategic alliances with manufacturers in
Singapore, Thailand and Brunei," said Teng.
  To cater for the requirements of the Asia Pacific market, Veka has
developed a "tropical compound", which safeguards against discolouration
of uPVC from prolonged exposure to intensive solar radiation, heat and
humidity.
  "In Malaysia, profiles will be developed in co-operation with leading
architects and designers to ensure local appeal."
  Veka headquarters is in Sendenhorst, Germany and it also has operations
in the United States, Britain, Belgium, France, Spain, Poland and China.

RM1b sales expected form Lestari Perdana

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

SAP Holdings Bhd expects RM1 billion in sales from its latest development
project, Lestari Perdana, situated next to a forest reserve in Selangor.
  The 400ha project will see the mushrooming of bungalows, semi-detached
units and link houses situated within an integrated garden township.
  Residents will also enjoy facilities such as fibre optic networks, a
hypermarket, a private hospital as well as schools and community halls.
  The project, managed by SAP Air Hitam Properties Sdn Bhd, is expected to
be completed within eight to 10 years.
  Sales of the first phase of the project, comprising bungalow lots, was
launched in Kuala Lumpur Saturday.
  SAP Air Hitam general manager (property sector II) Ahmad Azhar Hanafi
said the response had been satisfactory with 65 of the 200 bungalow lots
sold during a soft launch a month ago.
  "Sales from the 65 lots amount to RM20 million," he told reporters,
adding that the cost per square foot ranges from RM28 to RM37 while the
bungalow built-up designs range from 8,000 square feet to 17,000 square
feet.
  SAP is now finalising the details and plans for the link houses and
semi-detached units which are expected to be launched mid next year.

Bank to expand savings products

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

By Kasmiah Mustapha

PACIFIC Bank Bhd plans to boost its savings products and services in
response to the Government's call to nurture the saving habit especially
among schoolchildren and workers.
  President and chief executive officer Tan Sri Dr Lin See Yan said with
this in mind, the bank intends to introduce more savings products targeted
at people from various ages.
  "Our savings programme will be divided into four phases, starting from
age one right up until the person retires, as the needs of the public are
different."
  To develop the saving habit among the public, the Government has also
formed a Cabinet Committee on Savings, envisaged to help raise the
national savings rate and reduce the savings-investment gap.
  The country's savings rate which currently stands at 34.3 per cent is
insufficient to balance the needs for investment, which has reached 40 per
cent.
  Lin said as a first step, Pacific Bank has launched the Dolphin Save
account nationwide, to coincide with the opening of its branch in Bandar
Sunway, as part of its national savings campaign drive.
  Holders of the Dolphin Save account, who are children aged 12 and below,
will enjoy a free personal accident insurance coverage up to 10 times the
account balance and extended two-way insurance coverage which covers both
children and adults.
  Lin said through the systematic programme and a good branch network,
Pacific Bank hopes to attract more depositors. Last year, Pacific Bank's
total deposits were RM5.5 billion.
  "To date, the amount has increased to RM6.5 billion and we hope to
record total deposits of RM7 billion by the year end."
  Speaking to reporters after officiating Pacific Bank's latest branch in
Bandar Sunway on Saturday, Lin added the bank plans to have 60 branches by
the end of the year from 57 at present.
  "We believe with a strong branch network, we would be able to attract
more depositors and at the same time encourage people to save."

Telekom gets Amalan Tepat jobs

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

TELEKOM Malaysia Bhd has been given the exclusive rights for the next five
years to provide telecommunications infrastructure for projects conducted
by Amalan Tepat Sdn Bhd in Malacca.
  This includes the A Famosa Golf Resort in Alor Gajah.
  Telekom expects to spend a total of RM4.2 million as an initial cost to
provide telecommunication facilities there and to Amalan Tepat's other
projects in the near future.
  A memorandum of understanding was signed between the two companies on
Saturday in Malacca.
  Amalan Tepat was represented by its managing director Alex Lau while
Telekom by its senior vice-president, Dr Mohd Khir Harun. Also present
were Telekom's general manager for main trade and Government, Adnan Rofiee
and Amalan Tepat's executive director, Kevin Lau.
  Lau said Telekom was chosen for its wide experience in the field of
telecommunications.

First Islamic credit card in region launched by Arab-Malaysian Bank

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

THE Southeast Asian region's first Islamic credit card launched by Arab-
Malaysian Bank Bhd on Friday is designed to help Muslims conduct only
halal transactions, said managing director Azlan Zainol.
  Payments for haram transactions - as for liquor, gambling activities or
pornographic materials - will be automatically barred, following Visa
International Inc's agreement to block such payments worldwide.
  "This AMBank Al-Taslif Visa card is designed to help Muslims live the
Islamic way of life," said Azlan, adding that only about 15 types of
products and services out of Visa International's 2,000-odd categories
would be affected.
  He also said the card, designed in accordance with Islamic principles,
is not a credit card by conventional definitions.
  Other Islamic cards have been issued by Pakistan and some Middle East
nations, he said, but their adherence to Islamic principles is not as
comprehensive as the Al-Taslif card.
  For one, the credit limit for the AMBank card is determined by how much
the subscriber has placed as a fixed deposit in the Al-Mudharabah account,
and is as such different from convetional credit cards which require no
collateral.
  Further, the management fees or effective interest rate applied to
outstanding balances is capped at 12 per cent per annum.
  When the return on investment or interest earned on the fixed deposit is
also factored in, the net interest rate applied to outstanding balances
for card users works out to about only six per cent annually.
  "There is no other additional penalty charge on outstanding balances,"
Azlan said after the card was launched at Restoran Seri Melayu in Kuala
Lumpur by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  Conventional credit cards usually charge an additional five per cent
interest on late payments.
  However, the Al-Taslif card user will still have to pay a minimum of 15
per cent of his outstanding balance at the end of each month in compliance
with Bank Negara's ruling.
  Another feature of the card is that no cash advance can be obtained; it
can be used only for transaction payments.
  "We may allow this in the future if advice from the Syariah Council is
that such a service is within Islamic principles," said Aslan, adding that
the card can also be used to make zakat payments.
  Further, a RM1 rebate will be given to the subscriber for every RM100
spent on payments using the card. Part of this annual total of rebates
will be given out to charity on behalf of the cardholder.
  "This is how Islamic principles should be applied. When doing business,
be prepared to also give to charity," Anwar said at the launch.

Talking point: Don't fall into credit card trap with wild spending

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

By K. H. Lim

CREDIT cards. Are they a boon or a bane? Depending on whom you talk to,
they can be either or both. We have heard of high income-earning
executives being hauled to court by card issuers for failing to pay their
debts. On the other hand, there are thousands of satisfied cardholders who
feel the card is as good as cash.
  Which brings us to the point: the card IS as good as cash. Therefore,
manage it like you manage your cash. Don't spend more than you can afford.
Of course, this is easier said than done. Which is why hundreds (maybe
thousands) of people have ended up on the wrong side of the law.
  In a timely move Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last Friday
directed Bank Negara to study how regulations could be further tightened
to protect card users.
  I suppose he had in mind the questionable practices of certain issuers.
These may range from being Shylock-ish in their unending search for
interest charges or their incessant barrage of unsolicited mail.
  But then again, why do banks have such an image problem when it comes to
credit cards? Is it because they need the revenue from penalties on late
payments or are they incurring high costs in their card operations.
  Other than charging penalties for late payments or direct interest on
rollover balances, banks also get revenue from card acceptors, ie outlets
which have signed contracts with the various card companies to accept
their cards.
  Certain issuers charge as much as two per cent of the value charged as
their commission while others go as low as 0.5 per cent. Market forces
have determined that these rates cannot be arbitrarily increased just to
ensure card-issuing banks meet operational costs.
  One will then have to look at the cost of their card operations.
Although costing profile and work culture may differ from bank to bank, I
cannot help but notice that at least two banks are very aggressive in
their marketing campaigns to attract cardholders.
  Besides enticing customers with various gifts (which means more costs),
these banks hire card sales executives on fairly high salaries and then
impose high targets for them to achieve.
  It's no wonder that these banks record the highest turnover of staff in
card sales operations. One must bear in mind that all these costs will
ultimately have to be borne by customers, in this case, cardholders.
  The pressure on these young and ambitious salespeople is so great that
they have, to their credit (pardon the pun), managed to sell their
products to people already holding cards belonging to other issuers.
  I know of people who not only carry different cards, but have two or
more Mastercards or Visa cards from different banks.
  Bank Negara statistics show that there were 1.8 million credit cards in
use as of end-June 1996 compared to 1.6 million a year earlier. I don't
think there were 200,000 new cardholders in the intervening 12 months.
This means among them were people who already had cards and were reeled in
by the "pressure-selling" tactics of these card sales executives who had
to meet quotas, failing which they would lose their jobs.
  Is it a wonder then, that the default rate has increased? One must bear
in mind that there are annual charges to pay besides the interest on
rollover balance.
  Here again, consumers must be aware of the various costs of owning
cards. Credit cards are no longer a status symbol; they have become a
necessity unless one relishes the idea of carrying large amounts of money,
or using ATMs every other day.
  Consumers must demand that card issuers do not charge annual fees, not
only for the first year, but also for subsequent years. After all, they
should run their card operations based on revenue from outlets and not
cardholders' penalties.
  To be fair, cardholders must charge a minimum of, say RM5,000 a year, so
that issuers can recoup costs. The minimum could be two or three tiered
depending on the "colour" of the card.
  Cardholders must always remember never to under-estimate what a monster
interest can turn out to be. Its cousin, called compound interest, is even
worse. I have personally known of people who surrendered their cards to
the issuers and gradually paid back what they owed over the next few
years. All due to an impulsive spending spree and a gross under-rating of
interest.
  Talking Point: The word credit card is a misnomer. It is the
convenience, not credit, that you need. Use it like a charge card. Make
use of the 20-day to 50-day interest-free period to pay. And pay in full.
Spend only what you can afford to pay in those 20-50 days. Otherwise,
don't.
  This way, both you and the bank will be happy.

Restructing to put TRI ahead in telecoms

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 25

By Elaine Jeyakumar

TECHNOLOGY Resources Industries Bhd is rearranging its corporate structure
under a five-year plan to further spearhead the group towards realising
its vision of becoming the premier telecommunications company in Malaysia.
  In an exercise known as Focus II, TRI is dividing its various
telecommunication activities into seven core areas:
  * mobile services,
  * international services,
  * value-added/content/multimedia
  * transmission
  * fixed network
  * data group and other products
  * international ventures.
  Focus II is a continuation of TRI's "Project Focus" implemented in April
1993 which outlined the group's focus and emphasis in the
telecommunications industry.
  Chairman and chief executive Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said the group's
business had grown such that there was a need to streamline its activities
into these core areas.
  "This will give us a better platform to expand each of the sectors and
move forward in the industry," he told a Press conference in Kuala Lumpur
on Saturday.
  Each of the seven units will be headed by a president who will oversee
and manage the activities of each sector, which will eventually be
separate business entities relying on their own strengths.
  Effectively, the group's activities will fall under seven main companies
under the TRI umbrella.
  Under the original structure, all of TRI's telecommunication activities
fell under the umbrella of its 100 per cent-owned subsidiary Cellular
Communications Network (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.
  Celcom's subsidiaries include Celcom Transmission (M) Sdn Bhd which
handles the group's transmission projects such as fibre-optics and
microwaves and Celcom Technology (M) Sdn Bhd which manages the value-added
and multimedia services.
  Under the restructured organisation of TRI, some of these companies will
be brought out from under Celcom and recognised as independent units in
their various sectors.
  "We will reposition them and possibly change the names of the companies
to better reflect their importance," said Tajudin.
  Meanwhile, Celcom will only concentrate on the cellular business and
handle the group's ART 900 and Celcom GSM services, trunk radio and paging
activities.
  Tajudin added that new companies would be set up for three business
units, namely the fixed network, data group and international venture
sectors.
  He said the group was also working towards product branding in a bid to
associate both the company and the products as one.
  "TRI is widely-known mainly as a cellular service provider because of
the Celcom mobile phone service network which is managed by Celcom.
  "What many do not realise is that we have a complete range of licences
to conduct a host of other telecommunication-related activities, some of
which have already been implemented."
  This includes one for the group's fixed network activities, which have
yet to make an impact on the industry. Nevertheless, TRI already has deals
with 25 companies to provide fixed services which are in various stages of
planning and implementation.
  Tajudin said in time, the cellular division, which now contributes 65
per cent towards the group's earnings, would become one of the smaller
contributors.
  The reduced contribution to about one-third of the group's earnings, is
expected in the light of the more rapid growth anticipated for the other
sectors.
  Tajudin said the ART 900 network was maturing and there was not much
room for further growth in that area. However, the Celcom GSM network has
potential for expansion.
  He said a number of the group's operations, such as international
services, transmission activities and value-added services, had already
started turning in a profit.
  Certain overseas joint ventures are also profitable. In addition, the
group has recently received the licence to conduct cellular operations in
Bangladesh.
  The restructuring of TRI is similar to the exercise undertaken by
Malaysia Airlines, which is also in Tajudin's stable of companies.
  Tajudin said the TRI restructuring exercise was expected to take between
12 and 18 months, encompassing the legal aspects as well as the
contractual agreements between the companies within the group.

Petronas set to issue third Yankee bond

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 25

PETRONAS has confirmed that it will issue a third Yankee bond soon to
raise funds to finance both ongoing and new projects in the downstream
sector.
  The national oil corporation's president, Datuk Mohd Hassan Marican,
said the bond, to be issued end of this month, or early next month,
followed two previous successful issues in 1993 and last year.
  Mohd Hassan said Petronas had appointed two American financial
institutions, CS First Boston and Solomon Brothers, as joint lead manager
for the issue.
  "But the size of the bond would be determined later ... if the price and
the response from the market is good, we will take as much as we can," he
said on Saturday after launching the new image for Petronas service
stations.
  The service station at Taman Sri Hartamas in Kuala Lumpur is the first
to adopt the new concept which includes the "Mesra" convenience stores,
mini post offices and automated teller machines.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Paloh "to be back on fast lane when S46 members join
Umno"

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

IT takes a lot to survive as the wife of a politician husband and this
could not be truer than in the case of the wife of Norzula Mat Diah,
Assemblyman for Paloh.
  Norzula's wife, a nurse, was transferred from Gua Musang to Kota Baru
last year in a move perceived to be connected to the fact that her husband
was an Opposition strongman. It seemed that the local Wanita Umno wing
thought she was campaigning among the patients.
  Since Norzula could not possibly move to Kota Baru, the couple made the
difficult decision that she resign from the service. And she did,
reluctantly and not without a great deal of resentment.
  The family also had to move out of the government quarters into a
makeshift home in the annex of the Semangat '46 service centre.
  Thus, it is high irony that barely a year later, her husband is now
preparing to return to Umno.
  "That's politics, I suppose," he said with a shrug.
  His long-suffering wife, he claimed, had been sabar sangat over the
latest development, or so he thinks.
  Norzula's constituency is virtually one huge land resettlement tract
variously under Kesedar or Felda. About the only big areas not under some
land scheme or other are the Orang Asli settlement in Pasir Linggi and a
traditional village in Limau Kasturi.
  Limau Kasturi is Paloh's current and sole claim to fame. The village was
the inspiration behind the award-winning TV drama of the same name, its
storyline woven around a teacher's dedication to his pupil in the face of
daunting Islamic fundamentalism.
  Fortunately, the problems faced by Norzula are far less unnerving.
  The population here is still very much tied to the land and subjected to
the caprices of nature. Thus, the off-fruit season often finds him
reaching deep into his pocket to meet requests from settlers for money for
their children's examination fees, uniforms or books. Requests for bigger
sums are forwarded to the Yayasan Kelantan Darulnaim or Kelantan Religious
Affairs and Malay Customs Council.
  A large chunk of his wakil rakyat allocation goes to constructing fish
ponds.
  Paloh, he said, will be back on the fast lane once Semangat '46 members
join Umno.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: The prince has big plans for placid Gua Musang

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

All reports on "My Wakil Rakyat and I" by Joceline Tan; Badrul Hisham
Mahzan

TENGKU Razaleigh Hamzah's association with Gua Musang began in 1969. Thus,
it seemed best not to be argumentative when he claimed to know almost
every nook and cranny of the constituency.
  Back then, getting to Gua Musang town - if it could be called a town -
meant a journey of a day and a half. The prince would motor from Kota Baru
to Kuala Krai where he would put up the night.
  The next morning he would be up at the crack of dawn, down some coffee
and head off to the train station to wait, hopefully, for the 6.15am,
southbound train. If all went well, meaning there was no derailment or
other delays, he and his entourage would arrive at Gua Musang before 11pm.
  Otherwise, he would still be waiting when the sun was overhead.
  The river was an alternative. But it was accessible only during the
rainy season which could be dangerous and less than accessible during the
dry season when it was safe.
  To his credit, the Kelantan prince endured the hardship and now, looking
back, even claimed that he found it beneficial.
  "It was a challenge. This is the best constituency for me to learn about
my state and my people," said, involuntarily slipping into the royal "my".
  Tengku Razaleigh is in Gua Musang at least once a month.
  There seems little doubt that he intends to roost over the constituency
for awhile to come judging by the house he has built as well as the annex
of facilities for meetings and gatherings nearby.
  It is here that even the humblest of constituents will come to see him.
  "Mostly they want a land title to their name," he said in what was to
become  a ringing refrain among the other wakil rakyat here.
  Being the benevolent host that he is, he ensures that they are fed and
rested before they depart. Those who have come long distances, as most of
them are apt to, often receive some reimbursement for the journey home.
  But Tengku Razaleigh's long-term intentions are perhaps most revealing
in his plans for the constituency. For several years now, he has been
talking about elevating Gua Musang into the State capital while Kota Baru
will enjoy the status as a royal town.
  The rationale is that Gua Musang is far more central a location than
Kota Baru in the peninsular context.
  And it is, geographically speaking. Gua Musang is certainly nearer Kuala
Lumpur, and all other major towns in the peninsula than Kota Baru.
  Unfortunately, only his supporters and those living in Gua Musang seem
to find this idea exciting.
  Shifting the capital calls for a great deal of political clout and until
such time that Tengku Razaleigh manages to rally such clout, then Gua
Musang town will remain a placid and sequestered dell.
  He also has grand plans for the town centre which he was unable to
develop further after breaking away from Umno.
  But now that he is breaking away from Pas, he intends to revive those
plans or as he put it: "I want to re-do the town centre once Nik Aziz (the
Tok Guru) retires."
  Then, more seriously, he said: "They (people here) have been left
behind."
  He believes some of the more immediate solutions to the people's
problems can be solved with better infrastructure (especially more feeder
roads linking remote villages to main route), residential schools and, of
course, jobs.
  Among the ordinary people, especially the Malays who make up 90 per cent
of the 100,000 population here, there is, after all these years, a certain
awe that a privileged personality like Tengku Razaleigh would choose to
spend time, money and effort on their behalf.
  Although much of his accomplishments came during the 1970s and 1980s,
the projects he pushed forth were right on target on the Malay pulse. He
quenched their thirst for land and he basically opened up what was till
then a god forsaken terrain.
  The Orang Asli support for him has also not been for nothing. He stands
among a handful of politicians who have treated the Orang Asli with the
respect and dignity they deserve and not only when he wants their votes.
  All this, explains to a large extent the bedrock of support that he
continues to command in spite of his political vacillation.
  Given the Malaysian propensity for titles, it would not come as a
surprise if he is lauded as the "Father of modern Gua Musang" one of these
days.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Requests for land titles will test rep's abilities

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

OMAR Muhamad favours the jubah and with his flowing beard and white
turban, he looks more like a Pas man than a Semangat '46 assemblyman.
  He also did not look well. The effects of a serious road accident
several years ago seem to have affected his train of thought and his
opinions came in hesitant spurts.
  Omar presides over the largest of the three State constituencies with
Orang Asli form a substantial segment of the electorate.
  His is perhaps the only constituency where special campaign strategies
and tactics are employed on the parts of both the ruling and opposition
parties to win over the Orang Asli.
  During the by-election, the BN air-dropped thousands of posters and
pamphlets from helicopters. The paper campaign may not have been very
useful then, given the less than desirable literacy rate, but the posters
were probably put to good use by the Orang Asli to cover up cracks and
gaps on the walls in their houses.
  Although many Orang Asli have been moved to more permanent settlements,
a large number still prefer to stick to their traditional sites that can
only be reached by river or on foot in a journey that sometimes takes up
to two days.
  And according to Omar, the best form of persuasion with these gentle
people is not through "air-mail" but face-to-face contact.
  "Everybody wants land titles ... Malays, Orang Asli, squatters," he said
in a resgned manner.
  The legendary Malay attachment to the land could not be more stark than
here in the Kelantan heartland.
  In fact, there are some 1,000 squatters clamouring for land titles in
his constituency, a task that will surely put him to the test in the next
few years.

RM150,000 grab from goldsmith shop

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

SEREMBAN, Sun. - Four masked men, three with pistols and another with a
knife, escaped with jewellery worth RM150,000 during a robbery at a
goldsmith shop in Jalan Datuk Bandar Tunggal yesterday.
  The robbers who struck just before the shop closed for business at
6.30pm escaped in a car which was later found abandoned near a shopping
complex about 200 metres away.
  A district police spokesman said the robbers had warned several workers
and its owner to surrender jewellery placed in several trays inside a
glass showcase.
  He said the robbers scooped the jewellery into several bags. However,
during the heist an alarm in the shop was triggered and the robbers fled
with the loot in a car driven by another accomplice, which was parked
outside the shop.
  Police later found a white Proton Saga car, believed to have been
abandoned by the robbers, at the basement of a shopping complex in Jalan
Tuanku Munawir, about 200m from the goldsmith shop at 9am today.
  Those with any information on the robbery are urged to contact the
district police station at 06-7635522.

Bahasa: An appeal to private sector

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

By Hanizah Hashim

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Private sector leaders should show their commitment
towards Government's efforts to increase the use of Bahasa Malaysia by
holding discussions through open forums.
  Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka`s director-general Abdul Aziz Deraman said the
participation of the private sector in forums to be held in the 1996-98
Private Sector National Language Movement was essential.
  He said these forums would provide a platform for discussions and give a
clearer picture on the problems faced by the private sector in
implementing the use of the national language.
  Abdul Aziz was opening the forum "Enhancing the Economic Value of the
National Language" organised by the DBP and Malaysian Linguistics
Association yesterday.
  The panelists were Permodalan Nasional Bhd's group chief executive Datuk
Mohd Helmi Mohd Taib, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd's managing director Datuk
Ahmad Tajuddin Abdul Rahman and Universiti Sains Malaysia lecturer
Professor Abdullah Hassan.
  Abdul Aziz said open forums would provide the best arena for the
exchange of ideas and opinions on ways to achieve the movement's objective
with the support and co-operation of the private sector.
  During the panel discussion, chaired by former DBP director-general
Datuk Hassan Ahmad, Mohd Helmi said it was important to find ways to
encourage the use of Bahasa Malaysia in the private sector.
  However, he said, in the financial sector, clearer directives were
needed from Bank Negara for the increased use of the national language in
official transactions.
  "The current reality of the job market in the private sector is that
graduates with a good command of the English language was preferred as
this is the language used for business communication.
  "We have to find ways to increase the use of Bahasa Malaysia in the
private sector or else graduates from local universities would not be
accepted as their lower proficiency in English could be viewed as a
weakness," he said.
  Ahmad Tajuddin said extra effort from all sectors and closer co-
operation between the public and private sectors would be needed to make
Bahasa Malaysia a respected language in the business community.
  He said the profit motive was an important factor in the private sector,
thus it would seem unnecessary to translate a document into Bahasa
Malaysia if the English version was more commonly used.
  Economic strength was vital, he said, citing the "language pride" of the
Japanese as an example which made it necessary for those interested in
doing business with them to learn the Japaneses language for easier
communication.
  "If we are economically successful, more people will want to know how we
succeed and will learn our language and culture."

60 unwed pregnant women find shelter in Negri

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

SEREMBAN, Sun. - Sixty unwed pregnant women have been placed under the
care of the State Welfare Department and a non-governmental organisation
in Negri Sembilan.
  Of the total, 56 have been placed in welfare institutions under the
department throughout the State while the remaining are under the care of
the State Malaysian Islamic Welfare Organisation branch.
  State Unity and Community Development Committee chairman Goh Siow Huat
said today most of them were students of private learning institutions and
factory workers aged between 16 and 19 years.
  He said some of them had sought the assistance of the department
voluntarily while the others were either sent by their families or ordered
by the courts to be placed under the department's care.
  "Most of them became pregnant after indulging in sexual relationship
with their male companions who later abandoned them," he said, adding that
these women came from all over the country.
  He said the four women under the care of Perkim were from outside the
State who became pregnant while working here.
  Goh said the department would take care of the pregnant women including
delivering their babies who would be returned to the mothers or their
families or placed under its adoption scheme.
  "We are really serious in wanting to help unwed pregnant mothers. So we
hope they will not be shy or afraid to come forward."
  The department's move was not to encourage pregnancies outside marriage
but to provide a place for these women to deliver their babies in efforts
to curb cases of abandoned babies, he said.
  Goh urged parents to instil discipline among their children especially
through values and religious knowledge to prevent them from indulging in
unhealthy activities.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Rozali Isohak: A genuinely nice chap in politics

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

IT was hard to believe that the voice roaring through the loud speaker
belonged to Datuk Rozali Isohak.
  The first and last time I met him, had been in his office. Then, he had
struck me as a gentle soul, soft-spoken and muted in his views.
  And here he was, under the blazing mid-afternoon sun, lambasting Pas in
a fashion almost comparable to the king of political oratory, Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim.
  Later, he said a little sheepishly: "This is Kelantan. You have to talk
like that to get their attention."
  Actually, as the Kelantan media clique will tell you, Rozali is a
genuinely "nice chap", so much so, that one wonders what he is doing in a
business like politics. Then again, niceness is not exactly the most
effective of political tools.
  He is one of Tengku Razaleigh's most trusted party comrades which
perhaps explains his appointment as Deputy Menteri Besar II. The party had
to settle for the "II" after failing to get their hands on the "I", and it
was incidents like this which eroded the early camaraderie of Semangat '46
and Pas.
  His constituency, Dabong, is one of the most remote and underdeveloped
in Kelantan. Here, roads are more the exception than the norm and many
villages are accessible only by river.
  The country may have been catapulted along at eight per cent growth and
skyscrapers in KL may be making headlines worldwide, but life has changed
minimally for Malays here.
  The everyday act of going to school continues to be a physical challenge
while a simple illness may lead to death. Amenities and services urbanites
take for granted are still the stuff of dreams or as they say here, mimpi
saja.
  According to Rozali, projects scheduled under the Sixth Malaysia Plan
were not implemented. This included a road linking Dabong and Gua Musang
and a bridge over Sungai Galas.
  The rural economy does not generate new employment and Dabong has seen a
steady migration of its young people.
  The biggest employer is the Komplex Perkayuan Kelantan, a subsidiary of
the Kelantan Economic Development Corporation with a payroll of 200; the
Majlis Daerah Kuala Krai Selatan comes a close second with 100 employees.
  "Dabong needs at least 1,000 more jobs," Rozali said.
  Like most politicians, Rozali thinks his constituency has tourism
potential. The Stong Hill Resort, boasting the longest waterfall in South
East Asia, has attracted more than 10,000 visitors, mainly foreigners.
  The Assemblyman returns weekly. As is typical of the way politics and
religion tend to merge in Kelantan, Rozali arrives in Dabong in time for
Friday prayers and then stays back at the mosque to meet his constituents.
  He has a service centre run by five volunteers but some constituents
still travel all the way to Kota Baru to see him.
  Rozali is confident the Dabong electorate will go where Tengku Razaleigh
goes. And although his party's pending merger withUmno has captured the
national imagination, life in Dabong is unlikely to change radically.

Datuk Rozali Isohak
(APU - Parti Melayu Semangat '46)
N41 - Dabong
Age: 46
Married with five children; Deputy Menteri Besar II; third-term
Assemblyman; State S46 liaison chief.

Squash.: Ong to skip Hong Kong doubles tour

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By A. Devaraj

PROFESSIONAL player Ong Beng Hee, who has set his sights on winning the
Milo-Dunlop PJ Open title early next month, intends to skip the doubles
playing tour of Hong Kong on Sept 27-29.
  Beng Hee's father, K.H. Ong, said yesterday that the playing tour is too
close to the PJ Open, which is scheduled for Oct 2-5 at the Astaka courts.
  Said Ong: "Quite frankly Beng Hee is not very keen on playing doubles.
He'd rather concentrate on singles and for this year's PJ Open. I think he
has a very good chance of winning it."
  Ong has requested the SRA of Malaysia to reconsider sending his son for
the Hong Kong trip.
  SRAM executive director Lt Kol (R) Wong Ah Jit said yesterday they were
looking into Ong's request. "If Beng Hee is not really keen on playing
doubles in Hong Kong, there's no point in sending him. However, we will
make a decision soon."
  National director of coaching Mej (R) S. Maniam is currently in India on
a coaching course and SRAM are likely to wait for him to return before
making a decision.
  Beng Hee is supposed to partner Kenneth Low in Hong Kong. The other
players named for the Hong Kong trip include Yap Kok Four, Ng Tian Sin,
Tan Tian Huat, Ricky Lee and Allan Soyza.
  For the PJ Open, Beng Hee is seeded second behind Low and the duo are
expected to meet in the final.
  Said Ong: "If Beng Hee is excused from the Hong Kong trip, he will be
fresh for the PJ Open and that is another reason why I would prefer him
not to go.

Squash.: SRAM prepare players for England stint

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By A. Devaraj

THE SRA of Malaysia will concentrate on improving the fitness of Kenneth
Low, Ong Beng Hee, Yap Kok Four and Kuan Choy Lin before they leave for a
four-month stint in England on Nov 1.
  SRAM executive director Lt Kol (R) Wong Ah Jit said this is to ensure
that they will be ready for the tough training and playing stints in
England.
  Said Wong: "We don't want them to waste time on their fitness there when
we can do it here. That is why they are doing a lot of runs and gym work
and will be ready, fitness wise, for the England stint."
  Low and Yap will be attached to John Milton, who runs Proace Management
in Broxbourne, outside London.
  Ong and Choy Lin will be attached to national coach Jamie Hickox. But
all of them will be staying together, only the training programmes will be
separate.
  "In the case of Ong, he will be playing matches with professionals in
London and also Wales while the others will be basically staying in
Broxbourne.
  "Proace, who manage several top profession`ls, will come up with a
training programme for Low and Yap while Hickox will prepare a schedule
for Choy Lin and Ong.
  "However, we have insisted that the players be involved in the League
where they will be able to play against some of the top names in the
world. The English League is a very tough one and most of the top players
in the world are involved in the League in November and December.
  "However I'm not sure whether there is a League for women where Choy Lin
can compete."
  Wong said that in the latest fitness tests conducted on the players
early this month at the National Sports Council sports and medicine unit,
Low was the fittest.
  "Low's results were impressive. He only has a fat level of five per cent
and this is very good. Top American athletes have a fat level of three per
cent.
  "Ong's results were also good but Yap is overweight and needs to lose
some weight and will have to undergo a special diet.
  "Choy Lin is also carrying excess weight and she too will have to diet.
  "However, we are still awaiting the final overall results of all the
players. Once we get that, those who are not fit will have to undergo
extra fitness training before they leave for England."

ACC qualifier 1996.: Cricket.: Bangladesh outclass UAE

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By C. Navaratnam

BANGLADESH gave a classic all-round display to outclass the United Arab
Emirates by 108 runs in the final of the Pepsi-Asian Cricket Council
qualifying round competition at the Kilat Club padang yesterday.
  With this convincing win, Bangladesh have qualified for the Asian Cup
four-nation tournament in Sri Lanka next year. They will play against the
Test playing giants Pakistan, India and hosts Sri Lanka.
  Bangladesh were certainly a cut above UAE in all aspects of the game.
UAE, who fielded five players who took part in the World Cup competition
earlier this year, batted badly and went down meekly.
  Bangladesh, electing to bat, knocked up 212 runs in 49.3 overs. They
were given a flying start by their openers, Shariar Hoss`in and Harun-Ur
Rashid, who put on 66 runs by the 16th over.
  Shariar, in particular, was quick to punish the loose balls and went on
to make a majestic 58 which included seven fours off 95 balls, while Harun
hit a well-grafted 21.
  In-form Aminul Islam coming in No 4, kept up the tempo by belting 46
runs in only 44 balls.
  After his dismissal, wickets began to fall at regular intervals and they
were trotting at 180 for 9 but their last pair, Saiful Islam (15 n.o.) and
Sheikh Salauddin (8), batted well for a valuable 32-run partnership.
  Off-spinner Saleem Raza was easily the pick of the bowlers capturing
three for 31.
  Set a target of making just slightly more than four runs an over for
victory, UAE opening bat, Saleem Raza took off in blistering style
smashing 11 runs in the opening over off left arm medium pacer Anisur
Rahman.
  However, Saleem failed to last long and went out to a superb diving
catch by Mohamed Rafiq at deep midwicket off Khaled Mahmud for 20 runs off
17 balls.
  They then lost three quick wickets and were precariously placed at four
for 49 but a fifth wicket stand of 39 runs by Qais Farook (14) and Arshad
Laiq (31 n.o.) saw the score move up to 88.
  With the Bangladesh spinners bowling intelligently and backed by tight
fielding, the UAE batting crumbled and they were all out for 104 in 36.5
overs.
  Medium pacer Khaled Mahmud, who came in as a late replacement after
their regular opening bowler Hasibul Hossain was hurt during a training
session on the eve of the competition on Aug 5, was adjudged man-of-the-
match by match referee K. Srikanth, former Indian Test opening bat.
  "He fully deserves it. He broke the back of the UAE batting by taking
the three vital wickets to put his side on the road to victory," said
Srikanth.
  Off spinner Sheikh Salauddin bowled effectively to pick up three wickets
for 13 runs in six overs while left arm leg spinner Mohamed Rafiq bagged
two for 10 to trouble the batsmen.
  UAE, however, gained some consolation when Syed Azhar Saeed was named the
player-of-the-series.  FINAL - Bangladesh 212 (Shariar Hossain 58, Aminul
Islam 46, Harun-Ur Rashid 21, Saiful Islam 15 n.o.; Saleem Raza 3-31, Akbar
Rana 2-26, Arshad Laiq 2-35, Azhar Saeed 2-45).  UAE 104 (Arshad Laiq 31 n.o.,
Ali Akbar Rana 21, Saleem Raza 20, Quas Farook 14; Sheikh Saluddin 3-13,
Khaled Mahmud 3- 26, Mohamed Rafiq 2-10).

Hockey.: Yayasan see red despite victory

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

YAYASAN Negri Sembilan assistant manager Satwant Singh was an angry man
after his side's 2-0 win over Bank Bumiputra in a Malaysian Hockey League
match at the Tun Razak Stadium yesterday.
  Satwant's anger was not aimed at his players, who surprisingly struggled
to find the net in a match they dominated from start, but at umpire Surjit
Singh of Tenaga Nasional Berhad.
  The match ended on a controversial note when Mukesh Kumar was sent off
in the 67th minute after apparently hitting BBMB's Masrukin Kadiman on his
head with his (Mukesh) hockey stick.
  Mukesh and his teammates claimed it was an accident as Masrukin was
stretchered off with his head bleeding and were livid when Surjit thought
otherwise and flashed the red card.
  Satwant and several of his players could hardly contain their anger
after the match and stated what they thought of the umpiring.
  "I am aware that I can be hauled up for speaking my mind but this was
poor umpiring. What happened was not on purpose and I don't understand how
the umpire could have sent Mukesh off," said Satwant.
  YNS, who face Tenaga in a top-of-the-table clash next, will miss Mukesh
and also Maninderjit Singh and Satwant was furious.
  "I don't know what the umpire was trying to do. I leave it to others to
interpret it but something has to be done about the umpiring," said
Satwant.
  The red card constitutes an automatic one-match suspension. Maninderjit,
who received a yellow card in yesterday's match, misses the Tenaga clash
as well as it is his second.
  "I risk getting suspended by the Technical Committee but I have to speak
out as today's incident was daylight robbery," said Satwant.
  The controversial sending-off aside, the finishing of his players must
have also worried both Satwant and coach Stephen Van Huizen.
  Besides the two field goals through R. Shankar in the 13th minute and
Mukesh in the 50th minute, YNS missed one penalty stroke and 11 penalty
corners.
  In another match, star-studded Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (MPPJ)
returned to their winning ways when they edged Bank Simpanan Nasional 2-1
at the Petaling Jaya Stadium.
  MPPJ, who suffered a 3-2 defeat to defending League champions Maybank on
Saturday, looked lethargic throughout the match and needed a goal in each
half to subdue BSN.
  Forward Atul Kumar was the toast of the MPPJ team when he scored both
the goals in the 13th and 67th minutes.
  BSN, who did well despite losing 3-1 to favourites Yayasan Negri
Sembilan on Saturday, were again full of life yesterday.
  But for all their hard work, they only had a Sarjit Singh goal in the
59th minute to show for.
  BSN coach C. Paramalingam was obviously unhappy with the result.
  "But we are a young side. We will improve as the tournament goes on."
  In Ipoh, National player Kerpal Singh scored twice as pacesetters Tenaga
Nasional Berhad destroyed Armed Forces Electrical, Mechanical Engineering
Corps (JLJ) 4-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to three matches at the
Azlan Shah Stadium yesterday.
  It took Tenaga 30 minutes to breach the JLJ defence off a penalty
corner. The ball hit an onrushing JLJ defender and Kerpal was at the right
place to slot it home.
  Hardly three minutes after the break Tenaga increased their lead to 2-0
when ex-national player S. Sivabalan scored off a penalty stroke.
  Two minutes later, they were three up. Mahinder Singh scored off a move
initiated by Nor Basni Abas.
  Kerpal struck again in the 47th minute to stretch their lead to 4-0.
  However, JLJ never gave up and were rewarded with a consolation goal in
the 69th minute through former National player Zainal Hussain.
  In Kuantan, DeTas needed an Azman Ariffin goal in the 50th minute to
beat Segambut Hockey Club 1-0 at the Kuantan Hockey Stadium yesterday.
  DeTas controlled the game but could not capitalise on their chances.
They had 11 penalty corners, compared to one for Segambut, but failed to
convert any.
  Segambut's defence put up a brilliant performance and their goalkeeper
Jasvinder Singh was in top form.STANDINGS

Climbathon.: Salagan's hat-trick

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

DEFENDING champion Guainus Salagan coasted to an easy win in the men's
category of the 10th Malaysia Airlines-Mount Kinabalu international
climbathon, to notch a hat-trick of the title in Kota Kinabalu yesterday.
  With the exception of Indonesian Yoseph Lawa Yohanes, who finished
second, the top 10 finishers in the event - which attracted 164 entries
including 17 foreign competitors - were Malaysian runners.
  The climbathon is a race up and down Mt Kinabalu, Southeast Asia's
highest peak at 4,101 metres, with the event covering a distance of
21.4km. It is jointly organised by the Sabah Tourism Promotion Corporation
and the Sabah Parks with Malaysia Airlines as the main sponsor.
  The 29-year-old Guianus posted a time of 2 hours 52 minutes and 51
seconds to emulate his elder sister Hasny who yesterday extended her
winning streak in the women's category for three years in-a-row.
  First runners-up Yoseph recorded a time of 2:56:19 while self-employed
Rodimin Sodundu finished third with a time of 2:56:57.
  Guianus, who finished 82nd from a field of 160 international runners in
the recent World Mountain Race in Austria, received US$4,500 (RM11,250)
and a return air-ticket to London.
  The father of a three-year-old son also received a bonus of US$1,000 for
being the first to reach the summit.

Badminton.: Fancied Roslin too good for off-form Lo

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By J. Naidu

TOP SEED Roslin Hashim had no trouble winning the men's singles crown in
the Proton-EON Kedah Open badminton championships at the ASRC Hall in Alor
Star last night.
  He beat an off-form Lo Ah Heng, the 1995 All-England semifinalist, 15-5,
15-11.
  The small crowd which turned out last night were totally disappointed
with the token resistance provided by Lo and Roslin was in full control
from start to finish.
  In the first game, he took four straight points in one service. After
that, it was one-way traffic with Roslin collecting his points with
pinpoint smashes and drop-shots to wrap up the game in just 16 minutes.
  Lo checked himself and led 6-2 in the second game but Roslin caught up
at 6-6 and romped home an easy winner in 26 minutes.
  This is his fourth win in the circuit. Roslin was champion in the Sabah,
Perlis and Johor Opens.

Fook against second seeds Rosman Razak and Chew Choon Eng proved to be the
best tie of the night.
  After 72 gruelling minutes, Lee-Choong triumphed 8-15, 15-8, 18-14.
  In the women's singles final, second seed Norashikin Amin played a cool

minutes.
  The women's doubles final also saw topseeds Kuak Seiok Choon and
Norashikin Amin upset by second seeds Lim Pek Siah and Chor Hooi Yee. Pek
Siah and Hooi Yee gave a sterling performance to beat their opponents 15-
10, 15-4.

Soccer.: Chow tells youngsters to prove their worth

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 48

By Vijesh Rai

DESTINED to miss the Malaysia Cup for the fourth consecutive time, Kuala
Lumpur aim to prove that their season has not been a total waste when
Premier League action resumes on Saturday.
  So far it has been a season where the bad things have far outweighed the
good things, starting with the failure to land three Indonesian players,
the poor performance of players on whom KL had placed much hope on, right
to the sacking of Azrul Amri Burhan and Wong Kah Loon.
  But in coach Chow Kwai Lam, KL have a fighter who will not allow his
boys to surrender until the final whistle is blown on Oct 19 - KL's last
match of the season against Terengganu.
  "I know that we are almost out of the running as we have dropped too
many points and are far adrift of the others," said Chow.
  Far is the right word as KL, above only Kelantan in the standings, have
collected a meagre 13 points from the 20 matches they have played.
  Mathematically, they are still in with a chance but Chow knows that
their fate doesn't only depend on how they do in the remaining matches as
the performances of several other teams too will decide whether KL make
the Malaysia Cup.
  "The boys know that we are looking at missing the Malaysia Cup again but
I have told them that we have to continue fighting," said Chow.
  What Chow wants them to do in the remaining matches is to prove that
they are worthy of being called professional footballers.
  "They must go out and show that they are capable of making the grade and
that KL can again be a team to be reckoned with," said Chow.
  But for that to happen, there must be more commitment as this is
something which has been lacking in several players.
  "I have been stressing to them that good performances will not only
benefit the team but individually as well," said Chow.
  Indications are that several KL-bred players, who left the team for
greener pastures, might return next year and this is bound to create a
rivalry for places.
  And for those who are still keen on playing for the city side again next
season, good and committed performances in the remaining matches will help
them when their contracts come up for renewal.
  "All I want from them is a fighting performance that will show that KL
may be down this season but in time, we will rise again," said Chow.

Letter from Moscow: Enthralled by the change in seasons and fortunes

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 12

By Vadim Potapov

TO tell you the truth, all the shopping for our family is usually done by
my wife. Actually, it's not a difficult task, as Moscow shops are nowadays
full of whatever you may want, even such exotic items as shark's fins,
giant lobsters and abalone. Prices bite, as we say, but that's another
issue.
  Yesterday, however, quite unexpectedly for myself, I made a small
contribution towards the family's shopping: I bought five packs of
detergent for cleaning irons ... I must confess that I've never before
even heard about such a thing.
  It so happened that while leaving the metro, I noticed an elderly well-
dressed man. He was a retail trader and was selling all kinds of stuff.
  His appearance was so unusual for a tradesman that I decided to talk to
the man.
  His name was Nikolai Ivanovich, he was retired, and before that he had
been a scholar in the field of mathematics. He became involved in retail
trade because his pension was too small.
  I felt sorry for him, and that's how I found myself an owner of five
packs of the detergent.
  By the way, the sum I paid for the purchase was equal to one US dollar,
and I can't even imagine how many such packs it would be necessary to sell
in order to earn one's living.
  Today, in Russia, it is believed that the market has put everything in
proper perspective.
  This is true to a certain extent, but there are many people who failed
to find their places in this new life.
  The government is trying to render assistance to poor and old, but its
reserves are hardly considerable for the given purpose. Its main goal now
is to collect as many taxes as possible.
  For the first two weeks of this month, this issue was widely discussed
by top government officials.
  Trying to increase critically small budget revenues, the government
prepared a presidential decree allowing tax authorities to levy taxes on
all payments into individual bank accounts.
  The step could lead to double taxation for simply shifting money from
one account to another, and that's why the news immediately caused a wave
of public indignation.
  The decree was adopted mainly because of Alexandr Livshits, the new
Minister of Finance and a former chief economic adviser to Boris Yeltsin.
  Livshits became a well-known personality in Russia for his revenue-
rising measures and frequent appearances on TV screen.
  Earlier this year, he revealed and made public that directors of big
state enterprises - instead of paying wages to workers - deposited the
money to commercial banks, gaining high interests.
  Then Livshit's revelations caused no negative reaction with the public,
while in the last case, the protest were obvious.
  "My salary is hardly that of a royal family member, and I am definitely
against the government's intention to collect taxes two or even three
times, and that's exactly what the implementation of this decree might
lead to", said Irina, a salesgirl in a large Moscow supermarket.
  Many ordinary people shared Irina's sentiments, and responding to that
tornado of public resentment, the new tax decree was cancelled.
  The promptness of that decision surprised the public just as much as the
absurdity of the decree.
  Early this month, President Yeltsin continue to surprise the Russians.
  This time he announced on TV that he had a heart problem, and would
undergo an operation at the end of the month.
  People were astonished as they were not usd to the president speaking
about his health himself, but many of them sighed with relief, as finally
the uncertainty was over and done with.
  Those, who just the day before scolded Yeltsin for his two-month absence
before the public, felt compassion for the man after his annoucement.
  "I do hope the president will return to the Kremlin in good physical
condition, even if it takes a long time. I really wish him complete
recovery," Olga, 26, a school teacher, said.
  Against the background of Yeltsin's lengthy absence, Kremlin security
chief General Alexander Lebed continues to strengthen his authority.
  He is a frequent guest on TV screens, and media comments on his every
word.
  The euphoria he causes today eclipses many other news, including the
information about the creation of a new political union, "For Truth and
Order".
  It was announced by Lebed's supporters that the new movement would serve
as a kind of supporting force for the general outside the government.
  Its creation belonged to Lebed himself, and its main goal now is to back
his peace initiatives in Chechnya.
  It is expected that Lebed soon will be elected as the leader of this
party.
  It is also reported that the three organisations that comprise this
party have branches in more than 60 of 89 regions in Russia.
  Thus it may serve Lebed as a good base if he is to make a bid for
presidency.
  Summer is over. I thought about it when I saw a man feeding two cute
donkeys with a large red watermelon.
  Piles of the fruit have appeared in Moscow along with the first signs of
autumn.
  Life goes on.

DELL AKBAR KHAN (Malaysian team manager): We played well and we could
match the Thais. They deserve my praise. We have shown that we can stand
side by side with the Thais. And if we had a little bit of luck last
night, we could have won it.
********
THAVATCHAI SAJAKUL (Thailand coach): It's a relief we are still the
kingpins of Southeast Asia football. I've always said it was going to be
close and tough. But as I said again whoever scored first would have the
advantage. We did tonight and that made the difference. But Malaysia have
proven that they are now a force to be reckoned in Southeast Asia football
also.

Asean Football Federation Championship Cup (September 1-15, 1996 :
Singapore).: Soccer.: End of a fairy tale

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 48

By Dan Guen Chin

MALAYSIA  .......... 0
THAILAND  .......... 1

THE fairy tale had come to an end. A sad end for Malaysia on a night the
Thais were crowned champions of Asean soccer.
  For all their hard work and will to win, the Malaysians knew deep down
in their hearts that Thailand were by far the better team in the final of
the Asean Football Federation championship last night and the winner's
cheque of US$80,000 (about RM200,000) rightly belonged to them.
  Psychologically, Malaysia were affected even before the start. The
experience of Dollah Salleh was not there in the starting lineup to
provide the steadying influence in midfield.
  Dollah's ankle injury and the fear that it could not take the strain was
the reason why.
  And there was no place for Negri Sembilan fullback Faizal Zainal
although he had served his mandatory two-match suspension and was
available last night.
  For the Thais, there was a bonus in the form of skipper Surachai
Jaturapattarapong, who returned to the starting lineup - ankle injury or
no - for that was the tonic they needed.
  Right from the kick-off, the Thais went straight for the jugular and
they kept pressing forward, comfortable in the knowledge that their
attacking flair would pay off.
  And it didn't take them long either.
  Only nine minutes into the match, the Thais were ahead - and deservingly
so too.
  As wave after wave of the blue-shirted Thais charged forward, Kiatisuk
Senamuang - in his roving role - picked up the ball midway in the
Malaysian half.
  Zainal Abidin Hassan hesitated, so did B. Rajnikandh. Kiatisuk saw the
opening and, from 25 metres out, hit a tremendous shot with all the swerve
and power that beat Khairul Azman Mohamed all the way.
  There was no response from the Malaysians after the early setback, and
in all honesty, they could not raise their game to match the Thais.
  The Thais were in no mood to give the Malaysians the space and
opportunity to create their moves.
  Even when Thai skipper Surachai left the field midway in the first half
for Phitaya Santawong to come on, the rhythm of the Thai attack was never
out of sync.
  As Malaysia continued to struggle to find their footing and the form
which had taken them right through to the final, the Thais grew even
stronger and could have punished the Malaysians further in the 25th minute
but Apichard Teelamcharlemdit's attempt from 20 metres smacked the
crossbar.
  Even Zainal, who had hardly put a foot wrong throughout the tournament,
could no longer carry the burden of rallying his men to the team's cause
and neither could K. Sanbagamaran force his way through from midfield in
search of another crucial goal to turn Malaysia's fortune around.
  For the 33,000 fans gathered last night, and there were many Malaysians
among them, they knew deep inside who were the better team.
  It had to be the Thais with their fluent movement and the varied attack,
leaving the Malaysians with little to offer except maybe to wait for the
one silly mistake needed to punish the Thais.
  Even when Zainal abandoned his defensive role to push upfront; even when
Rusdee Sulong was taken off and even when M. Chandran came in Rizal
Sukiman, there was little likelihood that Malaysia could score from open
play.
  But the Thais did look good for another goal. And although it did not
come, there was no denying that the Cup was theirs for the taking.
  Malaysia gained some consolation though when Zainal was named the most
valuable player of the tournament after the final.
  MALAYSIA: Khairul Azman Mohamed, Zami Mohamed Noor, B. Rajnikhand, Azmil
Azali, Zainal Abidin Hassan, Rizal Sukiman (M. Chandran), Nazri Yunos, Yap
Wai Loon, Azman Adnan, Rusdee Sulong (Shamsurin Abdul Rahman), K.
Sanbagamaran (Faizal Zainal).
  THAILAND: Wacharapong Somchit, Kritsada Piandit, Surachai Phatanapong

Teelamcharlemdit (Jakarat Tonhongsa),  Natipong Sritong-In, Surachai
Jaturapattarapong, Kiatisuk Senamuang, Worawwot Srimaka, Dusit Chalermsan,
Phitaya Santawong.
  Referee: Yoshimi Ogawa (Jpn).
  * IN the third placing playoff earlier, Vietnam came good last night
and, in doing so, made the Indonesians look so ordinary.
  Vietnam were one up in the 10th minute thanks to a cheeky back heel from
Huynh Quoc Cuong after Nguyen Hong Son had split the Indon defence.
  Vietnam went 2-0 up in the 27th minute when Hong Son's cross from the
right saw Indonesian defender Yeyen Tumena deflecting the ball into his
own net.
Indonesia pulled a goal back in the 65th minute from a Kurniawan Yulianto
shot from 15 metres out.
  But the Vietnamese dealt them another blow in the 76th minute after Hong
Son was brought down in the box and skipper Vo Hoang Bu made it 3-1 from
the spot.
  There was a brief fightback from the Indonesians after they reduced the
deficit in the 84th minute, from a wonderful goal put away by Aples
Gidgeon but it came too late.

Editorial: Bosnia votes to make or break

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 12

BOSNIA just made it in time to vote. On Saturday, the last day set by the
Dayton timetable, the international community narrowly managed to shepherd
the warring sides to the ballot box. It was Bosnia's brightest spot since
the Dayton signing last year. But plenty of hard feelings remain. Since
the Dayton implementation, all sides have been gravitating towards their
bastions and strongholds. Returning refugees have not been welcomed,
particularly by their Serb transplanters. Local mixed community elections,
such as in Mostar, have not been harmonious. Similar elections are due for
the rest of the country, with little cause for rejoicing. All parties
strike and parry and take postures - each looking to get what they can out
of the loose ends of the Dayton plan.
  Most of those loose ends could have been tightened by a more resolute
implementation effort. As it happened, Dayton's sponsors took too much for
granted after the accords' signing. They delayed the removal of its
biggest obstacle - renegade Serb leader Radovan Karadzic - and gave the
indicted war criminal enough freedom to push his own and the other sides
deeper into their nationalist corners. It is in the safety of these
corners that they have remained stuck, and where their votes will
eventually count.
  Disagreements about how sternly to treat the rebel Serbs have remained
to divide the Americans and Europeans even after the removal of Karadzic.
The Europeans never acted tough enough to purge the Serb leadership of his
supporters and their persistent calls for a separate Republika Srpska in
contravention of the Dayton formula. The Serbs were made to back down only
about a week before the elections. They have toned down their defiance,
rather cunningly calculating that they have a better chance of holding on
to ethnically cleansed territory (Dayton had handed them 51 per cent of
the country) by fixing ballot majorities than by showing resistance. In
the elections, non-Serbs returning to their former hometowns were
channelled to polling stations through specified routes, where many of
them found their names absent from the rolls. The shadow of ethnic
cleasing and forced eviction clouds the elections in other ways - more
than a fifth of the votes cast were the postal ballots of Bosnians chased
out of their homeland.
  Twenty-five years ago, the West pooled some US$60 million to help out a
Yugoslavia thrown on a limb by Marshal Tito's death. About four years ago,
their hastiness in recognising the independence of the Yugoslav
constituent states left the federation in tatters. The Europeans still
cannot see the difference between ameliorating and aggravating their
"Balkan problem," acting in two minds over the guilt of the Serbs in the
present crisis. Their dithering reinforced the Serbs' closed-in mentality,
justifying their acts of genocide and brutality on the grounds that the
rest of the world were against them. Although the holding of the elections
has been a qualified success, its results are anything but certain.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is too full of bad memories to cure its history in one
day. At best, Dayton will create something much less than a mini-
Yugoslavia - but at least Bosnia will survive, hopefully long enough to
heal its wounds. At worse, the institutional strings forced on by a weak-
willed international community will be pulled to breaking point - by a
Bosnia electing, rather than fighting, to carve itself up.

Letter: Artists as keepers of Malaysian national heritage

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Jane Hughes

DURING a recent visit to Malaysia, I could not help wondering if even the
best Malaysian artist could survive the constant bombardment of cultural
imperialism from the West.
  Television, cinema, advertising push us all towards an international
homogeny that is hard to resist. In the art world, this is particularly
dangerous as a nation's cultural heritage needs to be nurtured in order to
flourish and move forward.
  I have spoken to many Malaysian artists who think deeply about this
threat and grapple with the problem in their work. Most have trained in
the West or been taught by visiting Western artists. Some influence is not
a bad thing as long as it does not become exclusive. Artists must, and do,
strive to take only the best of Western influences while remaining firmly
rooted in traditional cultural ideology.
  So artists realise the danger and take their role as keepers of national
identity seriously but there is an even more insidious threat. This comes
from the patrons and general public to whom art works are offered. If
their tastes are affected by the call to ape Western styles, will they not
demand such art?
  Few artists are privileged enough to be able to ignore such economic
influences.
  There are two main courses of action that would help this problem. The
first is greater government support for the arts in general with more
consistent provision for presenting contemporary art to a wide public.
While some States seem to provide lavishly, official commitment elsewhere
appears to be less enthusiastic. Improved State funding would ease the
economic pressure on artists.
  The second course of action is greater promotion of Malaysian art
overseas.
  Although there has been a few forays by artists to exhibit
internationally, Malaysian art is still almost unknown in the UK and the
US. I feel certain that if westerners had access to more contemporary
Malaysian art, it would be applauded unequivocally. Consequently, as the
Malaysian public see how their culture is valued, it will encourage an
even greater national confidence that is essential to withstand outside
forces.
  Malaysian art is an excellent advertisement for the country and should
be given a more prominent role.
  Politicians should not forget that, ultimately, all societies are
remembered for their culture.

Letter: Desludging of septic tanks: IWK explains

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Mirza Mohamed Tariq

I REFER to two letters that appeared in the New Straits Times recently,
regarding the need to desludge septic tanks and sewerage rates. There
seems to be still many misconceptions about desludging of septic tanks.
  Septic tanks are settlement tanks and need to be desludged according to
their design. The Malaysian Standard (MS 1228) for a septic tank serving a
household of five people is two-metre cubic. These septic tanks are
designed with a settling basin with a retention time of 24 hours and a
sludge storage capacity of up to two years.
  Accordingly, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government's Technical
Committee on Sewerage Services has recommended that septic tanks be
desludged once in two years on an average to ensure that they operate
efficiently and their final effluents do not pollute the environment.
  If not desludged, these septic tanks will cause sludge solids to be
discharged into the waterways. Hence, it is not surprising that the
Department of Environment has identified domestic sewage as one of the
major pollutants of our rivers in every annual report.
  The sewerage rates for a domestic customer varies between RM2 and RM10 a
month and there are no additional charges for scheduled desludging.
Pending the outcome of the Sewerage Review Committee, IWK continues to
provide the scheduled desludging service and appeals to all customers to
co-operate and ensure that their septic tanks are desludged in order to
safeguard their immediate environment.

Letter: JB council's reason for failure to pay its debt is a real joke

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By H. Tan

AS a citizen from the State of Johore, and an old resident of Johor Baru,
I don't know whether to laugh or cry when I read in the New Straits Times
on Sept 6, that the Johor Baru City Council had failed to pay a debt of
RM100,380.67 to a music production house as a result of which the council
was sued and its premises, which has over RM100,000 worth of equipment and
other items inside, sealed.
  Failure to pay the debt, according to the council's secretary, was
"because of a communication breakdown". What will happen if the office
equipment and other items are sold to pay off the debt?
  Presumbly, the council's entire administrative machinery will grind to a
halt and the reason will be "because of a total office equipment
breakdown". What other jokes can the council produce to entertain us?

Letter: Arts or Science: Ringgit and sen is main issue

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By N. Sum

WE have heard calls from politicians and educationists to arrest the
declining interest of students in science and to make the subject more
interesting in class so that students would prefer to take up Science
subjects instead of Arts.
  But that is not the crux of the problem. It is a matter of ringgit and
sen.  At the end of school life and when the person starts to earn a
living, how much more can the former Science student earn compared to the
Arts graduate despite the extra effort put in to study Science subjects?
  The private sector does not call for more Science students as it does
not need scientists to sell a product or a service. So the banking, hotel,
tourism and trading industries, to name a few, do not need scientists.
Only in the Research and Development wing of the pharmaceutical, food,
chemical, heavy and light industries are a few scientists needed.
  In almost every country, it is the Government sector that employs the
largest number of scientists.
  Prior to the implementation of the New Remuneration System in 1992, a
A11 officer (senior timescale) earned about RM250 more than his junior A19
(timescale) officer.
  With the implementation of the NRS, the senior timescale officer is now
downgraded to a timescale officer. Not only that, within the same category
(Kategori IV), there are numerous grades according to the departments they
serve in.
  For example, in the Education Department, it is DG3, in the Agriculture
sector, it is G3, in the Science sector, it is C3, in the Economic sector,
it is E3 and so on and so forth.
  What is so demoralising is that with the implementation of the NRS, the
former A11 senior timescale officer may be earning a few ringgit less than
a former A19 timescale officer in another department. Particularly galling
is that he may have a Master's or a doctorate whereas the former A19
officer may only have a general degree (without Honours).
  Not only that, the system of salary increments to the P2 and P3 scales
from the P1 scale within the same category may see the former A19
timescale officer earning more than the former A11 senior timescale
officer.
  It is already bad enough that very often, junior officers are promoted
to higher posts (Kategori II) over more senior officers because of
favouritism. But to earn less than junior officers may be the last straw.
  Such is the anomaly of the NRS in the Government sector that mediocrity
is prevalent among the scientists; not that the scientists are mediocre,
(after all, they were the creme de la creme of their schools and their
universities), nor did they achieve mediocrity, but they had mediocrity
thrust upon them.
  For some of them, their talent in sales matches their talent in science,
and so they opt for the private sector. But to rub salt into their wounds,
the Government has stopped those in the teaching and medical professions
from opting out, citing their services are critically needed; yet at the
same time, treating them like bad step-children, to be punished and not
rewarded!
  However, for many others, (some have served more than 20 years), they
have no choice but to remain in the civil service until mandatory
retirement, since the private sector does not require that many
scientists.
  So, do not blame the parents, who only have the welfare of their
children at heart, if they advise their children to drop science subjects.
As it is, it has been stated that the country needs 10,000 accountants by
the end of the century, but has anyone said that the country needs 10,000
scientists who will be rewarded according to their work? Since the country
does not respect and reward scientists accordingly, how can scientists
respect themselves?

Outlook: Safety at workplace not for government to shoulder alone

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Lee Lam Thye

DEPUTY Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim launched a month-long
nationwide campaign on occupational safety and health on Sept 3 initiated
by the Ministry of Human Resources.
  This effort by the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health
of the Human Resources Ministry is being carried out with the objective of
increasing awareness among employers and employees on the importance of
occupational safety and health as well as to make OSH practices part of
our culture.
  Deputy Human Resources Minister Datuk Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir has
revealed that since the introduction of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act 1994, the number of workplace accidents has declined.
  He said the accident rate last year was 15 per 1,000 workers (117,231
accidents) compared with 17 per 1,000 workers (125,535 accidents) in 1994.
  But fatalities rose from 787 in 1994 to 1,167 last year.
  Now that the campaign has started, our industries need to re-assess
their safety and health practices, to see how far they fulfil present
requirements.
  In the final analysis, it is not only the awareness that we should seek
to promote but the palpable will to achieve the targets set for an
accident-free workplace.
  Employees and unions have a special stake in this life and death issue
and must assert their right for a high safety standard at the workplace.
  There is also a necessity for people to change to meet the demands of
industrial development.
  The most important change is that of attitude towards safety and health
practices at worksites.
  There is a need to remove the notion that safety and health at work are
the responsibility of the Government alone.
  It is not. It is a collective responsibility.
  In this respect the top-level management must prove their commitment and
adopt a pro-active approach.
  They should employ safety engineers, industrial hygienists and
occupational physicians and conduct occupational safety and health
programmes.
  Industrial accidents, including occupational diseases constitute a
serious problem. Apart from loss of life, injuries and personal suffering
to the victims and their dependants, industrial accidents also cause much
economic loss.
  Unlike accidents, occupational diseases are difficult to detect becuase
the signs take a longer time to manifest. The cumulative cost is
tremendous.
  Everybody loses - the employer, employee, Government and the nation.
Losses to property are quantifiable but human suffering is not.

Jitters over control by consortium

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 14

By Harris Iskandar Taib; Shareem Amry

PRIVATE waste contractors fear abuse of power, favouritism and
victimisation at the hands of the consortium that won the contract for the
nationwide privatisation of garbage collection.
  Klang Valley Solid Waste Contractors' Association president Francis Lai
said there was also no guarantee their services would not be wrongfully
terminated in favour of other contractors lobbying to take over their
existing contracts.
  "We are not against privatisation. What we are asking from the
consortium is that it liaise with us and let us know what the entire plan
will be like. At the moment it holds our future in its hands."
  The consortium, led by Hicom Holdings Bhd, and also comprising Malaysian
Mining Corporation, Konsortium K.K. Industries and Konsortium Consec Gali,
is set to take over the nation's waste collection on Jan 1 next year.
  It has set up a company called Eminent Flora Sdn Bhd to undertake the
project, and to date, has already taken over the dumpsite at Taman
Beringin.
  The consortium recently submitted a draft proposal of a new law
governing garbage collection to the Economic Planning Unit.
  New legislation is necessary not only to set national standards of
garbage management, standards now under the discretion of the local
councils, but also to award the consortium jurisdiction over all areas of
garbage collection.
  This includes collecting, storing, transporting, processing, treating
and recycling solid wastes, dealing with domestic, commercial, non-toxic
industrial and construction wastes and wastes from road cleaning, drain
and river cleaning.
  Lai said the association could offer some valuable suggestions and ideas
to the consortium if there was only an effort to consult them.
  "We do not want to get shortchanged by the privatisation programme. That
is why it is necessary for the consortiums and the Government to let us in
on their plans.
  "Some of us have invested a lot in machinery and equipment. Contrary to
belief, this is not a very lucrative business.
  "Therefore, if it is wiser for us to fold up now we will do it rather
than lose much more by waiting."
  Private sector waste collectors have been working on contract for all
142 local municipal councils since 1976. In the central and northern
regions alone, their investments add up to an estimated RM240 million and
they directly employ about 2,500 people.
  Alarmed by the privatisation exercise, private contractors formed the
association in December last year to put forward a plea to the Government:
Let us stay in business.
  In a letter to the Housing and Local Government Ministry dated July 16
this year, the association wrote: "We want our stake recognised so that we
are allowed to co-exist with the Government-appointment consortium
 ...Specifically, we would like to continue servicing the trade and
industrial community."
  Their stake can only be assured if legislation, currently being drafted
to make way for the privatisation exercise, states clearly that the
consortium will only handle residential waste and leave industrial garbage
collection to private contractors.
  The consortium is expected to allow private waste contractors already
servicing this industry a grace period before eventually being absorbed as
sub-contractors.
  Lai proposed that the consortium draw up a set of regulations and
principles that would allow the association to supervise and regulate all
sub-contractors on its behalf.
  He said the consortium should also include in the new legislation being
drawn up, a provision requiring all sub-contractors to become members of
the association before being allowed to operate.
  This would make it easier to regulate the operators, rather than the
consortium being left with the task of tackling every sub-contractor
individually.
  Describing the plans to take over every sector of waste treatment as
ambitious, he said the consortium should instead concentrate on opening
and managing new and existing dumpsites, the building of transfer stations
and incinerators.
  Some residents are unenthusiastic about changing the system for fear of
being at the mercy of the consortium.
  Said Bukit Bandaraya's residents association president Tunku Zahiah
Tunku Sulong: "Based on our past experience, we are worried that we would
not be able to address our complaints to the consortium as effectively as
we can to City Hall.
  "At least City Hall has shown that they will respond if we tell them our
problem.
  "When we have complaints about the cutting of grass in our area on the
other hand, which is handled by a private company, it is not so easy."
  "What happens when the contractors fail to collect our rubbish on the
designated time and date?" asked Petaling Jaya resident Ramlan Ismail.
"Does the new legislation allow us the opportunity to seek compensation
and damages?"
  Another houseowner was worried about the method of billing, fearing
there might not be a way to prove if the contractors were overcharging
him.
  "If we are going to be billed by the bin, this means every household
must keep track of how many bins of rubbish they dispose in a month.
  "What happens when our figures do not tally with that of the
contractor?"
  Perhaps the biggest question left unanswered in the project to privatise
the country's waste treatment system is whether the consumer will have a
choice of disposing the rubbish himself and so avoiding having to pay for
privatised services.
  One resident likened the situation to the privatisation of highways: "If
a motorist refuses to pay toll, he can still use the trunk road. Will we
have the same option?"
  Unlike the treatment of sewage, consumers have the capability and
resources to discard rubbish themselves as it involves no sophisticated
equipment and technical expertise.
  The present system makes it compulsory for consumers to pay for the
services as it is part of the assessment charges which also includes the
installation and maintenance of street lighting, drains and the cutting of
grass.
  But when charges for rubbish collection are taken out of the assessment
and the service run by a company instead of the Government, then the
service becomes more of an option.
  The new legislation is expected to address these issues, besides
proposing methods of how to separate charges for the collection of garbage
from the assessment charges.

Hanky-panky in garbage collection jobs

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 14

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Garbage collectors, who make low bids to get their
contracts, are cutting corners to ensure profits by hiring lorry drivers
and owners to do the job part-time but at the expense of the environment.
  The part-timers are dumping garbage indiscriminately as some don't even
know where the dumpsites are, people in the business said this week.
  The contractors' cost-cutting measures also ranged from not picking up
garbage as regularly as the contract specified, to the use of open lorries
instead of compactor trucks.
  "Some who win the contracts don't even own proper garbage compactors.
They haul the rubbish in open lorries, which is a cheaper mode of
transportation but very unsanitary," said Yamin Vong, group general
manager of the Sitamas Group, which also includes Conwaste Disposal
Services Sdn Bhd.
  Other private garbage collectors, who have been complementing local
council services since 1976, said these contractors were able to obtain
contracts from the local councils through low bids.
  "But they are not in the business so they don't even know where the
proper dumpsites are," said Hi-Tech Waste Management Sdn Bhd director
David Zon.
  "What happens is they just discard the garbage indiscriminately."
  With the average Malaysian tossing out between 0.5kg and 0.8kg of
rubbish a day, this has given rise to a number of foul, illegal dumpsites.
  But those in the industry claim that the contractors are not the only
ones to be blamed as the local councils are also partly at fault.
  There are allegations that some councillors who sit on the tender board
award contracts to companies owned by them, relatives or friends by
overriding the Urban Services Department's recommendations by a simple
majority vote.
  There are even accusations of councillors or politicians monopolising
the entire rubbish collection service within one district.
  "We know who they are, but there is no way to prove that these companies
belong to them because the permits are issued in the name of other
individuals," said one contractor.
  "What we know is that they collect a certain percentage at the end of
the month. Some politicians are also involved, lobbying for contracts
either for themselves or for their supporters."
  In some cases, allegations have also tainted the local council senior
officials.
  "Don't be surprised if the health inspectors, the council secretary, one
of the directors or even the council president has an interest in one of
the companies which have been awarded a contract for refuse collection,"
said another private contractor.
  When contacted, local authorities did not deny that their services fall
short of expectations, but said they were not professionally-trained to
handle the job and did not have the resources to compete with private
contractors.
  "This is why we need professionals to do it. Many of the people in local
councils today do not have the expertise to handle waste management,
because the entire rubbish industry is different today than it was 20
years ago," said Petaling Jaya Municipal Council president Mohd Nor Bador.
  "In the past, it was just a matter of collecting the rubbish and
disposing it. Today's urban services development involves recycling and
incineration. We are not trained to do this, and this will involve plenty
of re-evaluation."
  Mohd Nor said it would be unfair to say local councils were completely
inefficient in handling rubbish. Because of the lack of a proper system
and proper resources, he said, it would appear as if the local councils
were incompetent.

Concerted effort vital to maintain clean image of Langkawi island

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

By K. Bala

LANGKAWI, Sun. - Depending on the authorities alone to strive for a
constant clean image for the island resort is going to be a difficult
task.
  There must be help and concern from all parties - the business sector,
voluntary bodies, schools, sports bodies, political parties and the
layman.
  The District Council does carry out clean-up campaigns and invites
various parties to join them but these must be prolonged and not on an ad-
hoc basis.
  Hotels, particularly the bigger ones and other tour related businesses
do organise clean-ups in places other than their surroundings. But these
are few and too far in between to be effective. And one tends to get the
feeling that the outside clean-up is for media publicity.
  Sheraton Perdana general manager John O Shea is all for hotels to take
part regularly in such clean-ups by providing the voluntary manpower in
organised clean-ups.
  "A group of hotels and tour organisations can adopt a particular area
near their vicinity on a regular basis," he says.
  The hotel which opened for full business recently did a clean-up of the
Masjid Al-Hana and surrounding areas.
  Langkawi Village Resort manager Feisol Danker and public relations
manager for both Pelangi Beach Resort and Burau Bay resort, David Fong,
are also for the move for more co-ordinated efforts.
  "True, all the bigger hotels clean their surroundings and beaches daily
but if the other areas where our guests go are not as clean, it may negate
our efforts," Feisol says.
  Unlike major towns there are not many voluntary and sports bodies on the
island but the few active ones can play their part.
  For instance, the active Beach Hash House Harriers who have their run
every Sunday can adopt a particular beach to clean on the eve of the run
at least once a month.
  Kelab Puteri Langkawi comprising women in business organises an annual
charity event to raise funds for the needy.
  Its president Khorshida Begum said they are also contemplating getting
their husbands and children to take part in gotong royong activities
regularly.
  Perhaps the political parties particularly the BN component parties
which have large memberships could devote time to non-political activities
like clean-up of beaches and the town.
  The sector that has benefited most from the Langkawi boom are shopping
outlets in town, a few of whom were reported to have recorded a turnover
of more than RM1 million a month each.
  The least they can do is to employ workers if their own employees are
busy helping out in the business to clean up their surroundings of litter
and the clogged drains on a weekly or fortnightly basis instead of merely
complaining about the problems.
  This will sort of repay the island and community for the booming
business they have been enjoying because of the duty-free port status.
  Schools too can play their part in inculcating the clean habit from
young.
  Schools can organise at district level such activities just like they do
for sports and get the children to be involved with parental permission.
  All they have to do is pick up the empty cans, bottles, palm fronds and
driftwood without dirtying their hands too much.

Demand for inquiry into death of workers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 19

IPOH, Sun. - The Perak Information Network and Service Organisation today
called for an inquiry to determine the party responsible for the
electrocution of two factory workers at Sungai Kinta in Jalan Raja Musa
Aziz on Friday night.
  Pinso legal adviser M. Kula Segaran said the Deputy Public Prosecutor's
office should apply for a magistrate to sit as coroner.
  He said the court should also determine whether Tenaga Nasional, Ipoh
City Council or the contractor carrying out the road widening project was
responsible for the incident.
  The bodies of R. Arumugam, 32, of Taman Emas in Chemor and A.
Santhanakumar, 28, of Pokok Assam, Taiping were found at the river bank by
a member of the public who called the police about 10.30pm.
  Tenaga Nasional staff removed a live electric wire near a bridge which
was also being widened.
  Preliminary investigations revealed that Santhanakumar touched the wire
while Arumugam was also electrocuted when he went to his friend's aid.

A higher standard of cleanliness is needed

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 19

LANGKAWI, Sun. - Village elder Aziz Musa,77, told his teacher son, Kamal,
32, that the big porch in his recently built house on a piece of land he
had presented would be just another tempat ayam berak (a spot for chicken
droppings).
  Both father and son laughed, for the remark made in humour, is a common
happening in kampungs on this enchanting island where chicken roam freely
just like the cows and buffaloes do in the green fields and at times stray
on to the roads.
  With wooden homes giving way to brick buildings as the island awoke from
its slumber under seven generations of curse by as the legend of Mahsuri
had it some eight years ago, the chickens tend to wander into the cement
flooring and make their droppings freely.
  But the specks of chicken droppings can be easily washed away. Just a
little water and a broom, the droppings disappear only to reappear a day
or two later.
  Of course a fencing around the homes can keep the hens, cockerels and
the chicks at bay.
  But these days city folk rarely get to see live chicken in their posh
housing estates except for dressed chicken in the supermarkets.
  Anyway the kampung chicken is much tastier than those from the
commercialised farms what with worry over use of nitrofuran in chicken
feed.
  This chicken episode bears importance when one discusses the cleanliness
of beaches and the blue waters of unique and scenic Langkawi comprising
104 islands.
  Generally, the beaches and waters are clean except for some litter and
occasional temporary spots of dark patches in the blue waters or on land.
  Elsewhere there are muddy or dusty roads depending on whether it wet or
dry season caused by the airport runway extension works and the marina
project on reclaimed coastal land in Kuala Muda and the island-wide
digging to lay a modern sewerage system.
  When these works are completed in a year or two, there will be bigger
runways to accommodate jumbo jets, a marina resembling the Mediterranean
and a comprehensive sewerage system.
  The only problem with this price for development is that most foreigners
plan their vacations well ahead.
  As they drive or ride a motorcycle along the pothole-ridden stretches,
they do not know that all these works are part of the development plan for
the island and that they will turn the muddy beaches of Kuala Muda into a
paradise.
  There is therefore a need to minimise the discomfort unless we want them
to return home with wrong impressions. Anyway the authorities have set
some guidelines of late and there seems to be some improvement.
  For an international resort which attracted some 1.83 million tourists
last year, there should be a higher standard of cleanliness, not
withstanding the more than a dozen big signboards along the main roads
exhorting the people to "Keep Langkawi clean".
  Just as the porch of Aziz's home will be soiled after a period of time
if the chicken droppings are left uncleaned, the image of the island may
suffer the same fate.
  The chicken can get away at most with a shoo or by having a slipper
hurled at it but the island requires the authorities, the residents,
visitors and those involved in development works to act more responsibly.
  Talk at coffeshops and pubs - the latter being an attraction among
Caucasians who have managed to make the island their second home - tend to
centre on the rapid pace of development and the accompanying problems it
may face including mantaining the serenity and cleanliness.
  Their fears of over-development at the expense of environment appear to
have little basis given the repeated assurances by Government leaders and
planners that the tranquillity of the resort island would not be
sacrificed.
  That means the hills, forests, sandy beaches and clear waters which make
the island unique will always be there for these have made Langkawi
popular since it opened its doors in 1987.
  "Rest assured that we are not going to kill the goose that lays the
golden egg," said Datuk Abdul Halil Mutalib, the general manager of
Langkawi Development Authority recently.
  But the fears expressed at the coffeeshops and pubs should not be
dismissed totally. For what it is worth, there is need for vigilance to
prevent the island from following the less cleaner ways of Penang or Port
Dickson.
  At present, the island's beaches and waters can be considered clean.
  The District Council which is responsible for mantaining the island
clean can do better particularly in Kuah town where rubbish and clogged
drains are a common sight.
  With impending nationwide privatisation of garbage collection, the
council should ensure that the company responsible does a better job than
what it has been doing.
  Most of the white sandy beaches along Pantai Cenang, Pantai Tengah,
Tanjung Rhu, Datai and Burau Bay are without doubt clean simply because
they are fronts for many of the classier hotels.
  Just like the family which has to wash the chicken droppings, these
hotels diligently keep their surroundings including the beaches (which
belong to the Government) clean by deploying workers to pick up litter and
other debris washed ashore daily. They are more interested in getting
their guests to return.
  The problem is with the budget chalets fronting the sea. Their
managements are more worried about filling their rooms rather than to
spare a worker or two to clean the surroundings including the beaches.
  There is also a problem with the public beaches like certain stretches
of Pantai Cenang, Pantai Tengah, Pantai Kok, Pantai Pasir Hitam and Pasir
Tengkorak.
  There has been an ongoing debate as to who the culprits behind the
littering are.
  The argument by the council that it is the work of visitors seems to
hold water.
  For generally, the Malays from the kampungs have always taken pride of
their home and surroundings, however poor they may be.
  Of course, Malaysians have yet to learn to take pride in their
surroundings in their their own backyards let alone when they are out of
town.
  Surprisingly, visitors from Asian countries also acquire the Malaysian
habit. Perhaps they want to express their freedom after being subject to
stringent anti-litter laws back home.
  We too have anti-litter laws. There are signboards in various parts of
the island which read: Warning. Please do not litter. Fine RM2,000.
  If enforcement is lax then we should not put up such signboards as they
are a waste of money. Fine them irrespective of whether they are
Malaysians or foreigners and word will get around just like the jail term
for drink-driving which was first enforced here.
  The unique Pantai Pasir Hitam (Black Sand Beach) is among the tourist
attractions which draws a large number of visitors. At times one has
difficulty seeing the sand as they are covered with plastic and driftwood.
  After the clean-up by council workers it looks better but worsens until
the next spruce-up.
  A group of traders operates from stalls built by the Government beside
this beach. A little gotong royong spirit can ensure cleanliness of the
short stretch which is their bread and butter.
  But then they would rather be counting the till selling samples of the
black sand and other souvenir items to the tourists. They are thinking of
getting rich with little investment while the Government and private
sector spend billions to make the island a popular international resort.
  Another scenic public spot is the short stretch at Pasir Tengkorak along
the way to Datai. Several wooden huts have been built amidst trees for use
by visitors who enjoy the clear cool waters of the Andaman sea.
  There are at least six large litter bins in the area yet garbage is
strewn all over.
  Perhaps more garbage bins should be put up. But frankly the beaches and
towns could do with more and bigger bins to prevent over-flow.
  But there is hope yet to change the littering habit among Malaysians
judging from the cleanliness along the Pantai Kok during a recent visit.
  It is a popular spot among the young expecially schoolchildren from
outstation who come to camp at the site. It was refreshing to see the
beach clean though many schoolchildren had camped there during the recent
school holidays.
  Perhaps the observations of two foreign tourists best sum up the
situation in Langkawi.
  Petite Miharu Nishima, 24, and her sister Yasue from Osaka who spent
three days on their first visit to the island found the beaches generally
clean though they had some reservations about the situation in Kuah town
where they went shopping.
  "You have such a beautiful island. Please ensure that it remains this
way, beautiful and more clean," says Miharu.
  Educationist Terry Swanson from New Zealand was at Pasir Tengkorak where
he had taken his wife Gillian and three children for a dip in the Andaman
waters in a 4WD hired from the five-star hotel where he was staying.
  He decided to spend a week in Langkawi - of which he heard so much -
after the New Zealand Education Fair in Kuala Lumpur.
  Asked for his frank opinion about the state of cleanliness in Langkawi,
Swanson, who is Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at Nelson Polytechnic
said:
  "You have beautiful white sand beaches, warm waters that are not
polluted and an enchanting island. You have a valuable asset which needs
to be protected and nurtured.
  "The island is not at all dirty but (the situation) could be better."
  The island could be cleaner just like the porch after Aziz and his wife
wash away the chicken droppings. Langkawi can be a shining example to
others with concerted efforts on the land and sea blessed by nature.
                       

Pix: Swanson ... could be better.

Pix: Nishima ... beaches generally clean.

Top Asian athletes among 3,000 for Terengganu run

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA TERENGGANU, Sun. - The Sept 22 Terengganu Bridge Run is expected to
attract some 3,000 participants.
  State Tourism Development, Arts, Culture and Sports Committee chairman
Datuk Aziz Awang said well-known Asian athletes were also expected to
participate.
  "Compared to the previous competitions, this year's response is
overwhelming," he said at a briefing for 700 tournament officials
yesterday.
  Among the international runners invited for the run are Myanmar's Thura
and Thinor, Chheng Piseh (Cambodia), Roy O Vence (the Philippines), Wong
Sai Wing (Singapore) and Mujini Ronala (Thailand).
  Indonesia will be sending its 15-year-old woman runner, Endang
Rahauingsih.
  India is sending its international woman runner, Sunita Godara.
  Singapore and Thailand will be sending the most number of participants,
with 250 runners each.
  So far more than RM225,000 has been collected for the run.
  Aziz said beginning this year the State Government had decided to turn
the 21.1km run into an annual event. Previously it was held biennially.
  He said each of the invited runners had a track record of less than 75
and 85 minutes respectively for the men's and women's categories.

Police launch city-wide campaign to fight crime

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Prevention is better than cure... With this in mind,
police today launched a city-wide crime prevention campaign and urged
cityfolk to fight crime.
  Police hope the campaign would help reduce the number of break-ins
reported at homes and business premises.
  "Since 1994, we have received 7,613 reports of break-ins at homes and
business establishments," city police chief Datuk Ismail Che Rus said.
  There were 2,910 reported cases in 1994, 2,922 cases last year and until
last month, police have received 1,781 reports.
  Police investigations revealed in most instances the burglars gained
entry into the premises through doors and windows.
  "Of the 7,613 cases reported since 1994, this method of entry was noted
in 5,636 cases," Ismail said.
  Besides this, 770 cases showed the burglars had gained entry through the
roof while 247 cases were pulled off with the use of duplicate keys.
  Ismail was speaking at the launch of the Crime Prevention campaign at
the Sri Sabah flats in Cheras.
  The campaign was jointly organised by city police and the Kuala Lumpur
Housing Developers Association.
   Also present were city Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior
Assistant Commissioner (II) Zakaria Mohamad, Sentul and Brickfields police
chiefs Assistant Commissioners J.R.J. Raj and John Chong respectively;
Cheras deputy police chief Superintendent Asmaon Alias and KLHDA president
Mustaza Mohamad.
  Ismail said despite premises being fitted with window and door grilles,
burglars still gained entry using basic house break-in tools like
screwdrivers and crow-bars.
  "Very often, these grilles are of low quality material and can be easily
removed using these tools, he explained.
  He also advised property owners to ensure that locks are changed or
added when they receive the keys to their new homes.
  "Anyone, from the labourer to the developer, who handled the keys prior
to the owners, could easily make duplicates," Ismail said, adding that
police have identified the Cheras district as having the highest crime
rate.
  In view of this, police have intensified their efforts in Jalan Peel,
Jalan Menteri, Jalan Bendahara, Taman Kobena, Taman Maluri, Taman Shamelin
Perkasa, Taman Miharja and the Sri Sabah flat.
  At a similar function in Brickfields, Chong said police have identified
the Happy Garden, Taman Bukit Aman and Brem Park housing estates to focus
their efforts as these areas have the highest crime rate in the district.

Fire razes factory, two houses

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Fire destroyed a furniture factory and two squatter
houses in Kampung Michael Chen, off Km13 Jalan Puchong today.
  Factory owner, Chin Chong Yau, 40, said the fire, which broke out about
4.30pm, destroyed finished products worth about RM900,000.
  A Fire Services Department spokesman said the fire was believed to have
started at one of the squatter houses.
  "We have ruled out a short circuit as the houses do not have electricity
supply," the spokesman said.

Fire Services Department to get new name, responsibilities

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Fire Services Department will be known as the
Fire and Rescue Services Department by the end of the year, under the
Government's plan to widen the scope of its duties.
  Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said his
ministry was preparing a working paper on the change of name and would be
presenting it to the Cabinet soon.
  Ting said this was the first time the department would be changing its
name since its formation.
  "The ministry plans to enhance the emergency and rescue services of the
department. It must be multi-disciplined and multi-skilled to keep abreast
with the rapid pace of development.
  "In fact, the department already carries out rescue work, in instances
when a building collapses, when there are landslides, flash floods and
road accidents. The Pos Dipang incident was a good example where fire-
fighters also carried out search and rescue operations.
  "The department also does work which has absolutely nothing to do with
fighting fires like helping detain mentally ill persons and catching
snakes."
  The Minister was speaking after opening a two-day International
Convention of Chung Shan Associations at the Concorde Hotel today.
  There were about 600 participants at the convention, which brought
together people who originated from the Chung Shan province in Kwangtung,
China.
  Participants came from over 20 countries to the convention, held for the
first time to discuss investment opportunities in Malaysia and to renew
old ties.
  Ting said between 20 and 40 per cent of the duties carried out by the
Fire Services Department had nothing to do with fighting fires. Fire-
fighters accepted the duties out of a sense of humanity, he said.
  On training for fire-fighters, Ting said the curriculum would be
revamped in line with the name change.
  "To my knowledge, however, their present training already encompasses
things other than fire fighting."
  Ting said a change in uniform for fire-fighters was also being
considered. He added: "We are looking at a design which is smarter and
more functional."
  Ting also appealed to the younger generation to join the department. He
said it was a risky job with very few takers.
  "There are also very few Chinese and Indians who want to join the
department as the economic boom has given rise to a lot of other job
opportunities."

Call for more biographies to be written on past leaders

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

KOTA KINABALU, Sun. - Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee said more books
should be written about past leaders so that their contribution to the
State and nation could be remembered.
  He said such books would particularly help the younger generation
appreciate the role played by these leaders in developing the State and
promoting unity.
  "The struggle of our past leaders ought to be remembered and appreciated
by the people," he said when launching an autobiography of Yang di-Pertua
Negeri Tun Sakaran Dandai at the Shangri-La's Tanjung Aru Resort
yesterday.
  Yong said books on other Yang di-Pertua Negeri such as Tun Datu Mustapha
Datu Harun, Tun Pengiran Ahmad Raffae, Tun Fuad Stephens and Tun Hamdan
Abdullah should also be written.
  The autobiography, compiled by former Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka director
Ismail Abbas and DBP staff Nadin Salleh and Japar Ungki, will be launched
on Monday to coincide with Sakaran's 66th birthday.

Spectacular dance contest

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

By Loo Kian Boon

AMATEUR and professional dancers of both the Latin and modern dance
disciplines came together to put up a spectacular dance gala when they
competed with one another for honours and glory at the second Malaysian
International Dancesport Grand Prix 1996 at the Mahkota Ballroom of Hotel
Istana Kuala Lumpur recently.
  The competition saw 74 pairs of dancers from seven different countries
in the Asia Pacific region competing in 10 categories.
  It was organised by the William and Luisa Danceworld, a dance school
opened by the husband and wife team of six-time Southeast Asia amateur
Latin champion and current Malaysian Professional Latin champion William
and Luisa Lor.
  The competitors, who came from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia, were split into the Latin and modern
sections which both included the novice, pre-amateur, senior, amateur
Closed and amateur Open categories.
  Sixteen adjudicators from the seven competing countries were invited as
judges during the finals.
  The adjudicators, who were either former or current ballroom dancing
champions, were led by 14-time Australian professional Latin champion
Anthony Gauci and Tania McGuinness.
  Before the competition commenced, guests as well as the contestants had
the opportunity to purchase from an array of ballroom dancing shoes for
both males and females outside the dining hall.
  The competition then began with the senior modern section in which eight
pairs took to the floor in their smart tail jackets and elegant ballroom
dresses.
  After six finals had been completed, the dance floor was cleared for the
arrival of the guests-of-honour Tunku Dara Naquiah Tuanku Ja'afar and her
husband Tunku Mudzaffar Tunku Mustapha.
  The competition was then formally declared open by chief organisers
William and Luisa Lor, followed by the parade of the contestants according
to their countries.
  In his welcoming speech, Lor thanked all the supporters and sponsors who
had contributed tremendously to the success of the dance competition.
  "It is hoped that by hosting this championship, we would be able to
further raise the level of ballroom dancers in Asia and particularly in
Malaysia," he said.
  "This championship will feature some of the top professional dancers
from the Asia Pacific region, who will highlight this event with their
special performances."
  Prizes were then presented to the winners of the first six finals by the
organising committee patron Datin May Lee Leong.
  Among the winners were John Lim and Joanne Leong in the senior modern
section, Sharizal Zainal and Lynette Ow in the novice modern section, and
Ng Le-On with his partner Cheah Su-Ann in the novice Latin section.
  Talking about the victory in the novice Latin category, Cheah expressed
her joy of winning her first dancing title.
  She then admitted about being a little confused when she was announced
as the winner along with her partner Ng.
  "This win was never expected especially when the competition from our
rivals was so strong. It was difficult for us to anticipate victory."
  The win was especially sweet for Cheah because she almost didn't make it
to the final when she sprained her ankle two weeks earlier.
  "Let's just say God answered my prayers," she added.
  Ng, who was also the amateur Latin champion at the Kuala Lumpur
international ballroom dancing championships last year with Andrea Quah,
gave full credit to his partner who struck up a good understanding with
him despite dancing together with her for only three months before the
competition.
  As the dinner commenced, the competition continued with the amateur
Latin Closed and amateur Latin Open finals.
  Unlike the modern dance finals, the Latin sections saw a much a younger
set of dancers.
  Dresses worn by the female partners are more vibrant and sexy.
  Even their male counterparts discarded the jackets and instead went for
plain long-sleeve shirts.
  The tempo of the music was also switched from the tango, cha-cha and the
waltz to the hippier tune of jive, samba, ramba (the dance of the bull
fighter) and the romantic love dance.
  In between competition, guests were also treated to some rare
demonstrations of Latin and modern dance by some of the established
dancers in the region.
  Incidentally, most of them have been invited as judges in the
championships and they sportingly obliged by taking the dance floor with
their partners to give competitors a tip or two.
  Among them were undefeated Indonesian professional modern champions and
grand finalists in all Southeast Asia professional championships Soenarko
Josodihardjo and Jenny Indrawati, 12-time Taiwanese modern champions and
professional modern and Latin champions John and Jennifer Shih, and seven-
time undefeated Southeast Asia professional ballroom champions Melvin and
Nancy Low.
  The highlight of the night was the amateur Latin Open and amateur modern
Open, which saw international participation.
  The star attraction was the sole Australian pair of Adam Reeve and
Rebecca Allen, who amazed the judges with lightning quick movements and
synchronised routines.
  There was no doubt they were the true champions when they were announced
as the winners of both the Open categories.

MAS wins bid to stage road race

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

MALAYSIA Airlines won the bid to host the World Airlines Road Race or Warr
97 in Kuala Lumpur next year.
  Although Malaysia Airlines has been participating since 1990, it was
only last year that it won the bid against five other airlines at the
Durban WARR.
  WARR is the largest and the most popular airline sporting event in terms
of participants.
  Hosting the event is a honour for Malaysia as it is the first time WARR
will be held in an Asian country since its inauguration in San Francisco
in 1982.
  It is anticipated that about 100 airlines with an estimated 4,000
participants will converge in Kuala Lumpur.
  However, Malaysia Airlines will be working hard to create history with
the highest number of participants, about 4,500.
  Last Saturday, a team of 15 Malaysia Airlines athletes left for Atlanta
for the WARR five and 10km races.

New committee to hold meeting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE Petaling District FA, under a new management council, will hold its
first meeting on Thursday.
  The meeting will be held at association (PDFA) president Megat Firdouz
Megat Junid's office in Kelana Jaya.
  Megat Firdouz, who at 27 became the youngest PDFA president, will chair
the meeting which is expected to discuss matters pertaining to the
adminstration of the association.
  But one man who is seen as livewire of PDFA is council member K.
Mukunthan, better known as Dass, who was largely responsible for Megat
Firdouz being at helm at the last biennial annual meeting.
  Mukunthan, a former FA of Selangor (FAS) staff and Selangor team
caretaker, is the link between the association and Megat Firdouz.
  He will be mainly responsible for the daily running of the association
with secretary S. Selearajan, a Fifa referee, and assistant secretary M.
Namasivayam.
  The meeting will see the appointment of the various sub-committee
chairmen.
  Megat Firdouz is expected to head the finance committee. Either Megat
Firdouz or vice-president K. Rajendran will take care of youth development
and rules, vice-president P. Mohan (competitions), vice-president Habibul
Rahman Kadir Shah (disciplinary) and senior council member Ismail Yaacob
(referees board).
  The PDFA is RM30,000 in the red and Megat Firdouz, who is also a Majlis
Daerah Petaling councillor, will shoulder the daunting task of putting the
association in the black in the next two years.
  The competitions committee will have to look into the three-division
league which has been poorly organised by the previous committee.
  It has to complete the league and start the FA Cup, which will involve
all 38 teams competing in the Super, Div One and Two Leagues.
  Besides this, the committee will also have to look at ways to raise
prize money for FA Cup champion and runner-up.
  Winners in tha PDFA League and FA Cup have not got their prize money in
the past but with the new council earlier promising to change that, the
association will have to start off with the current FA Cup.
  There has not been much development programmes for youths either. Though
PDFA has a team playing in the FAS Div Three, the team is in a shambles.
  It is time PDFA officials form a management committee for the handling
of the PDFA soccer team and participation in the FAS League.

Police urged to act fast against petrol bombers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

By R. Sittamparam

JOHOR BARU, Sun. - The Information Ministry has urged police to urgently
apprehend those responsible for hurling petrol bombs at the Royal Museum
and the State's RTM complex to avert repeat attacks.
  Its Deputy Minister Datuk Suleiman Mohamed said the incident should be
interpreted as an attack against the Goverment and that it was a very
serious matter.
  In the incident last Thursday, a youth on a motorcycle hurled two petrol
bombs at the Istana Besar, which houses the Royal Museum at Jalan Tun Dr
Ismail at 4.15pm.
  The youth, who was followed by two others in a car, proceeded to the RTM
complex and threw a petrol bomb at a guard house at the Jalan Tasek Utara
entrance about 45 minutes later. None of the petrol bombs exploded.
  The three then made their way to another guard house in Jalan Kolam Air
and smashed the glass panes of the guard house.
  It is believed that an RTM staff had received an obscene telephone call
during one of their live phone-in programmes on Friday, prompting RTM to
cancel all live telephone programmes.
  Speaking to reporters after officiating at the Malaysian Ex-Policemen's
Association's 24th annual delegates meeting in Skudai today, Suleiman
said:
  "The culprits should be nabbed as soon as possible as there is always
the fear that they will repeat the attacks.
  "The Ministry has received an initial report on the incident and we are
liaising closely with the police to keep in touch with the progress in
investigations."
  Suleiman dismissed the idea that the attack was linked to RTM's pro-
Government stand and selective programming.
  "Those who are dissatisfied with RTM programmes or its allegiance to the
Government can use the proper channels such as writing in with their
views.
  "RTM is not purely a profit making organisation, rather it also has a
social responsibility to fulfil, hence it cannot function like other
private stations."
  Meanwhile, district police chief S. Divakaran said police were
intensifying the investigation into the arson attack and were considering
several possible motives.
  Asked about grafitti on RTM's signboard at the junction of Jalan Kolam
Air and Jalan Tasek Utara, he said it was probably not related to the
incident.
  The word "Ria" was spray painted on the signboard. Ria is believed to
refer to the Radio Corporation of Singapore's Malay station "Ria 89.7".
  "We have not managed to uncover any clues so far but we hope to get some
leads from the findings of the Chemistry Department.
  "The department is presently analysing the fragments of the petrol bomb
and its components."
  Meanwhile, the Johor Security Working Committee conducted a thorough
investigation of Thursday's incident at the RTM complex today.
  RTM southern region broadcasting director Norzihan Mohd Salleh said the
probe was to ensure the premises would not be subject to a similar attack.

     16 Sep 1996, page 21

By Y.S. Segaran

PLAYERS battling for honours in the 16th Petaling Jaya Open squash
championship from Sept 27 to Oct 5 will have to be at their best to emerge
on top.
  The Open will be held at the newly renovated Astaka Squash Courts in
Petaling Jaya.
  Organising secretary Mary Ong said the draw for the men's Open was one
of the best in recent years.
  She said Squash Racquet Association Selangor (SRAS) president Datuk Mohd
Aini Taib would contribute RM1,000 to increase the prize money for the
men's Open section.
  Ong said Mohd Aini, who won the approval from Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Muhamamd Muhd Taib for the renovation of the Astaka venue, was eager to
see keener competition in the men's Open.
  After the draw was made, favourite Kenneth Low is the top seed in the
men's Open with fast improving Ong Beng Hee the number two while Jamie
Hickox and Yap Kok Four are joint third and fourth seeds.
  Barring upsets, Low and Beng Hee will meet in the final and their
matches have always been absorbing duels.

Three JB council officers told to explain

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

JOHOR BARU, Sun. - Three Johor Baru City Council senior officers have been
given show-cause letters pertaining to the council's delay in settling a
debt with a production company.
  Datuk Bandar Datuk Hashim Yahaya said the three had been asked to
explain why action should not be taken against them for the delay of
payment, resulting in the sealing of the council's office on Sept 3.
  Speaking to reporters after closing a property exposition here, he said
the officers were from its legal, administrative and treasury departments.
  On Sept 3, Jojos Production Sdn Bhd obtained a court order to seal the
council's office following the council's failure to settle a debt of
RM100,000.
  The amount was part of the RM200,000 payment due for services rendered
by Jojos Production for an entertainment show organised by the council at
the Dataran Bandaraya here on Jan 3, 1994.
  "Show-cause letters were given to the officers concerned on Sept 12.
They have one week to reply.
  "The disciplinary board will then decide what form of action to be taken
against them," he said.

Rakan Muda `promotes a healthy lifestyle'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Youths in the country should be involved in
activities like Rakan Muda as it promotes a balanced and healthy
lifestyle, 4B Kampung Selayang Lama branch chief Mohamad Ali Mohamad Odin
said today.
  He said youths were the future of the country since they would determine
the direction of the country's development.
  "The Rakan Muda programme launched today is aimed at ensuring that
youths do not fall prey to social ills.
  "They must realise that they are the country's treasure and that they
have roles and responsibilities," he said.
  Mohamad Ali was speaking at the opening of the Kepong Parliamentary
division's Rakan Muda Day by Youth and Sport Ministry's Parliamentary
Secretary Shahrizat Abdul Jalil at Sekolah Menengah Raja Abdullah.
  He also urged government agencies and the private sector to co-operate
with Youth and Sports Department in the various Rakan Muda programmes that
would be organised.
  He said this would help to prevent youths from being involved in
negative activities such as drug abuse and playing truant.
  Mohamad Ali said the Youth and Sports Department had identified a few
shopping complexes where Rakan Muda programmes would be carried out.
  Shahrizat, who was also the patron for today's function, expressed her
hope that the Kampung Selayang Lama community would take the opportunity
to ensure closer rapport among themselves.
  She said the programme was not only meant to prevent youths from being
involved in negative activities but also for the families to get
acquainted.
  Earlier, Shahrizat joined several residents in a 20-minutes aerobics
workout which was part of today's Rakan Muda activities.

Getting students to study nature at park

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

SHAH ALAM, Sun. - A joint educational programme between the Malaysian
Agriculture Park and schools should be established to help students learn
to appreciate nature, Agriculture Minister Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud
said today.
  He said such programmes would be beneficial to students at all levels as
the park was not confined to the study of agriculture.
  "There are a number of other fields that can be explored, ranging from
ecology, topography, biology and agronomy," he said at a gotong-royong at
the park organised by Esso Production Malaysia Inc employees.
  He added these programmes could also be extended to institutes of higher
learning for research and development purposes.
  Sulaiman said this would not only make the park more popular but was
also in line with the Government's efforts to instil environmental-
consciousness at all levels of society.
  Situated at Bukit Cahaya Seri Alam, the 1,258ha park is the world's
first Agro-Forestry park.
  As part of the gotong-royong project, about 70 Esso employees and the
park's workers helped replace broken planks along the jungle pathways and
clean up the surrounding areas.
  Esso also donated five safety convex mirrors for placement at strategic
points to warn road-users of on-coming traffic and 10 cement-ferrous
permanent garbage bins.
  In his speech, Esso Exploration Manager David H. Lehman said the project
was part of their community support programme with safety as this year's
theme.
  He hoped Esso's contribution would help make the park safer for
visitors.

Pahang to woo more tourists

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

PETALING JAYA, Sun. - The Pahang Government will implement a "development
strategy" for several potential tourist destinations which are situated
along the proposed East-West expressway, Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad
Khalil Yaacob said today.
  "There are three main corridors which can be further developed and
provided with infrastructure and other facilities, to attract more
tourists to the State.
  "They are situated in the centre of the proposed East-West expressway
which will soon link Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Terengganu via Kuantan in
Pahang," he said in his speech, read by the State's cultural and tourism
committee chairman Datuk Law Kee Long, at the launch of Pahang Arts and
Cultural Festival here.
  The three corridors are:
  * Highlands Corridor which comprises Cameron Highlands, Bukit Fraser and
Genting Highlands;
  * Middle Corridor which includes eco-tourism and agro-tourism
destinations like Taman Negara, Endau-Rompin, limestone caves, lakes and
other natural attractions;
  * Coastal Corridor which covers the entire 208 kilometre stretch from
Cheating to Rompin; plus
  * Railway Corridor which includes its stopovers at Mentakab and Kuala
Lipis towns.
  Khalil said the first three corridors would be developed along the road
networks while development activities for the fourth corridor would be
conducted along the tracks between the railway stations.
  "This Three-plus-One Tourism Corridor package will enable the State
government to increase its number of tourist destinations.
  "It will also provide socio-economic opportunities for the local
residents especially in the services and tourism-related sectors," he
said.
  Besides its legendary attractions, Khalil said the State also retained
such natural resources like its mountainous terrains, tropical
rainforests, flora and fauna, 208 kilometre-long coastline and tropical
islands, as its other tourist attractions.
  "Pahang is popularly known as Peninsular Malaysia's State of
superlatives. It can offer you a cultural experience and a chance to
explore the State's natural wonders and marine life.
  "With over 60 per cent of the State still covered with forests, Pahang
is proud to be in the forefront of making Malaysia greener," he said.
  Khalil said the State government was also in the process of gazetting
the Endau-Rompin forest reserve as a State Park, as another addition to
the State's list of tourist destinations.

Knockout tournament set to kick off Sunday

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE 5th Milo Unity Cup Under-18 soccer knockout competition at Jalan Timur
ground, Petaling Jaya on Sunday is expected to draw a good response.
  Organising chairman Mohamed Ariffin Hamzah said they were happy with the
response for the competition so far.
  "The response for the competition is good and we hope the teams will
show up early for the competition."
  Mohamed Ariffin said more than 30 teams have made preliminary enquiries
and are expected to participate in the one-day competition.
  "The last four competitions have been successful and we will leave
nothing to chance in our effort to make this year's competition better
than the previous years'."
  The annual series offers RM300 to the champion, RM150 to the runnerup
and RM100 to third and fourth finishers.
  The best players in goalkeeping, defending, midfield, topscorer and man-
of-the-match in the final will receive special awards.
  Besides, there will also be tins of Milo, Milo T-shirts and free drinks
for the top four teams, all sponsored by Nestle.
  Mohamed Ariffin said they were thankful to Milo for giving its full
support in promoting the game among youths in the Klang Valley.
  "The youngsters have not much action as there is no league competition
for their age-group. Thus, this kind of competition will be much welcomed
by the youngsters and parents."
  Mohamed Ariffin said that the FA of Selangor (FAS) could also use the
competition to shortlist players for youth programmes.
  Besides, Kelab Sukan Sri Indah is also identifying players to start its
own youth development programme together with Majlis Perbandaran Petaling
Jaya (MPPJ).
  The entrance fees for a team is RM50. For details call Rosnani Wahid at
03-2226960 or Sree at 018-8203185.

Team's dismal performance

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE national women's participation in the Kuala Lumpur Hockey Association
Div Three League is drawing a big blank.
  After three outings, they are right at the bottom of the standings with
no points, having lost all three matches.
  Despite the disastrous performance, the team is also taking a break from
the league for training stints and test matches overseas.
  In the previous three matches, it lost 3-2 to Royal Selangor Club, 3-1
to Bangsar Residents and 6-2 to Stamford College.
  And now, it has been reported the national squad will leave for Germany
on Sept 26 for training and test matches.
  A KLHA official said the performance and calibre of the national squad
was in question.
  "If the players cannot put up a decent performance against the Div Three
opponents, I don't see how they can be prepared to play test matches
overseas," said the official.

RM100m request to buy `naltrexone'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

KUANTAN, Sun. - The Health Ministry is seeking more than RM100 million
from the Federal Government so that it could implement the use of
addiction control pill "naltrexone" at the country's 28 dadah
rehabilitation centres.
  There are now 17,934 addicts being treated at the centres.
  Deputy Health Minister Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman said today:
"Curbing this social problem will top the ministry's main agenda until the
year 2000. We have to seek this allocation to reduce the number of
addicts."
  Siti Zaharah added that the allocation would be used in part to buy the
tablets. The rest would be for management expenses, she said after closing
the Paya Besar Innovative Day at a multi-purpose hall.
  From January to May, there were 1,022 cases of new addicts below the age
of 19. To date, 15,000 addicts had been tested positive for HIV and 40 per
cent of prisoners were found to be dadah abusers.
  The Government had to spend some RM517 million last year to curb the
abuse of dadah among youths and finance dadah rehabilitation programmes.
  Naltrexone is a narcotic antagonist, keeping heroin or other opiate
addicts off dadah. It works by blocking the opiate receptor sites on the
cell membranes, where the dadah takes effect. If a person on naltrexone
later takes in an opiate, it will have no addictive effect.
  Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said recently that the ministry had
conducted a one-year study on the use of the medicine on 176 addicts.
  The study, run by the Kuala Lumpur Hospital and Universiti Sains
Malaysia in Penang, showed encouraging results.
  Among others, addicts were able to stop their habit after a year of
treatment, he said.

Driving licence: Minimum age stays

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

LUMUT, Sun. - The Government has no immediate plans to raise the minimum
age of Malaysians to apply for driving licences as it is not an effective
solution to reduce road accidents, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling
Liong Sik said.
  Raising the age limit will only pose problems for working youths.
  "Some youths enter the job market when they are only 16 and it will be
unfair to them if we raise the age limit," Dr Ling said.
  The present minimum age to hold motorcycle licences is 16, 17 for cars
and 21 for heavy vehicles.
  He said an amendment to the Road Transport Act approved by Parliament
last month made it compulsory for all new drivers to undergo a probation
period.

Ling: Spend quality time with the family

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

By Vijayan Menon

RAWANG, Sun. - MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik today urged
party members to spend "quality time" with their families.
  Dr Ling, who is Transport Minister, said the family was the basic unit
of the nation and called on MCA leaders to spend more time with their
families despite their demanding schedules.
  "When people are involved in demanding careers and have to work long
hours, they should endeavour to spend quality time with their families."
  He said it was not the quantity but the quality of time that people
spent with their families that mattered.
  "Don't just spend time sleeping while with the family but engage in
wholesome discussions, sharing experiences and relating to one another,"
he said when opening the MCA national-level Family Day Carnival at Sekolah
Rendah Kebangsaan Sinaran Budi, Kuala Garing.
  The family day was organised by the party's Selayang division.
  He quoted a Chinese proverb "If the family is united even 10,000
problems can be solved," to illustrate the importance of nurturing strong
family ties.
  Dr Ling said the family was not only the basic unit of the nation but
also the fundamental unit of society and "it is also the fundamental unit
of the MCA".
  Later when asked how family units could be strengthened especially when
there were more cases of single parents and career-minded people delaying
marriages, he said this was not serious.
  "It involves only a tiny proportion of society. In general, people are
dating young and marrying early. I think only about five per cent of the
population are marrying late or do not believe in the institution."

SELANGOR edged Singapore 2-1 in a veterans' friendly soccer match at
Yayasan FAS ground in Kelana Jaya recently.
  Selangor was represented by FAS officials and former State players while
Singapore was led by the Majid Arif XI team.
  The visitors' line-up included former Singapore players Syed Ahmad,
Majid Arif, S. Rajagopal, Hasli Ibrahim, Nasir Jalil, Razali Alias and
former Malaysian internationals Ali Bakar and Zulkifli Norbit.
  Selangor was led by FAS president Datuk Mohd Aini Taib, deputy president
Tengku Ahmad Shah, vice-president Hamdan Abdul Rahman and council members.
  Former Selangor players include M. Chandran, Syed Harun Syed Jaafar,
Mohd Shah Norbit, Rashid Hassan, Reduan Abdullah and K. Rajagopal.
  FAS secretary Kudus Abdul Karim, 60, was the oldest player on the pitch
when he played in the second half as a leftback.
  Selangor went ahead in the 12th minute through Mohamed Ariffin Hamzah's
header while Harun Abdul Rahman's half-volley gave them a 2-0 halftime
lead.
  Midfielder Baharuddin Manan reduced the deficit for the Majid Arif side
when his grounder from just inside the box beat Rashid.
  Aini gave away prizes to both sides. The prizes and dinner were
sponsored by Mohd Ariffin Hamzah.

`Study wage disparity between expatriates and Malaysians'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

RAWANG, Sun. - The Finance Ministry and the International Trade and
Industry Ministry should study the huge disparity in the wages earned by
expatriate profesionals and managers and Malaysians doing the same jobs,
Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek said today.
  Lim said some of the jobs currently done by expatriates could be handled
by Malaysians who he said were equally efficient.
  He said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had once
expressed concern over the disparity in the wages paid to expatriates and
Malaysians.
  "On my part I feel there are certain jobs currently held by expatriates
which can be handled by Malaysians. I personally know cases where jobs
held by expatriates can easily be filled by Malaysians.
  "Locals are equally efficient and capable," he told reporters at the MCA
Family Day Carnival.

TO raise funds for its various ongoing community service projects, the Sri
Lanka Buddhist Temple in Sentul Pasar, Kuala Lumpur held a food fair at
the temple premises recently.
  As there was a sea of visitors, there was brisk business for all the 40
stalls set up by temple devotees and well-wishers.
  The fair, which was earlier launched by Bukit Bintang Member for
Parliament Dr Lee Chong Meng with a donation RM1,000, is expected to raise
about RM50,000 for projects like the Siri Jayanti free clinic, tuition for
poor children, annual food distribution to the poor, and visits to wards
and welfare centres with gifts.
  Lim Cheng Ean, president of the Siri Jayanti Welfare Organisation, said
the temple would use some of the money from the food fair to buy a kidney
dialysis machine and donate it to an institution.

Certain KL roads to have gazetted bus lanes

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

KUALA Lumpur City Hall is in the process of gazetting a few roads in the
city to have special lanes for buses.
  City Hall Urban Transport Department director Mahfix Omar said the
Federal Government had given its approval to the suggestion but City Hall
had yet to make the relevant changes to the infrastructure on the proposed
roads.
  The allocation of bus lanes will affect the current location of bus
stops, taxi stands, road signs and available space for road dividers.
  He said this after the 27th City Hall Directorate Day celebration at
Taman Tasik Titiwangsa on Saturday.
  As a trial, Mahfix said three roads would be gazetted to have bus lanes.
They are Jalan Raja Laut, Jalan Tun Razak and Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman.
  He said under the bus lane concept to be introduced, buses are not
allowed to go out of the designated lanes.
  "This is different from the concept used in other countries which allow
buses to go out of their lanes but not allowing other vehicles to go into
the bus lanes," he said.
  He said the concept was aimed at giving priority to buses to move faster
and also to discipline bus drivers.
  "The designated bus lanes are for the convenience of the buses to move
and also to discipline bus drivers from switching lanes or weaving in and
out of traffic as they like," he said.
  To avoid congestion in the designated bus lane, Mahfix said City Hall
planned to allocate one-and-a-half lanes for the buses.
  "It should be sufficient for the buses to overtake the buses that stop
to pick up or drop passengers."
  Mahfix said City Hall has received support from bus companies operating
in the city about the plan.
  Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif was reported as saying the
public would be invited to comment on the bus lane proposal.
  The proposal for designated bus lanes in the city was proposed for the
first time in 1980 but was later scraped as the authorities found it
difficult to implement the system.
  There was a move by City Hall to revive the 1980 plan in 1994 but the
result has yet to be seen.

Low cost homes for villagers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

THE Selangor Government, together with Bank Negara, will construct low
cost houses at Kampung Damansara Dalam in Petaling Jaya under the Projek
Perumahan Rakyat Termiskin scheme.
  State Executive Councillor Datuk Mohd Aini Taib said PPRT, a subsidiary
of Bank Negara, would acquire the land soon.
  He said the project would take off after minor details had been
finalised.
  "We are in the midst of finalising the terms and agreement of the joint
project. It is not easy as it involves villagers, the landowner and State
Government as well as PPRT," Mohd Aini said after launching the Petaling
Jaya Municipal Council's Bersih dan Indah campaign at the village
yesterday.
  He said the 10ha site housed more than 1,100 families, of whom a small
number were squatters.
  On the gotong-royong exercise, Mohd Aini said residents in the State
needed to play their part in ensuring their neighbourhood was clean and
beautiful.
  "Residents should work together to make gotong-royong a success. We want
to be aggressive in our effort to clean up areas, especially those which
are infested with illegal dumps."
  Mohd Aini said to further improve the rubbish collection system in
Petaling Jaya, it would have lorries collecting domestic waste and garden
refuse such as cut trees, twigs and plants.
  He said the council would provide the service which was chargable on a
fortnightly basis for residents.
  On the illegal video arcades, he said shopping complexes would also be
affected by the new ruling.
  "Our piority at the moment is to close down all illegal video arcades in
the State and concentrate on the legal arcades."
  He said the Government expected to shut down illegal arcades in the
State by the end of this month.

Video game machines seized in raid

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

By Angela Rao

THE Petaling Jaya Municipal Council confiscated more than 30 video game
machines from an illegal video arcade in Section 5, Petaling Jaya.
  The operation was the first to be held by the council after the Selangor
Government gazetted the Entertainment Enactment 1995 on Sept 1.
  The joint operation between the Petaling Jaya police department and the
council's enforcement unit hit a snag after three of the nine illegal
video centres visited were closed at 11am on Saturday.
  Initially, it was presumed that the operators adhered to the one-week
notice which ended on Friday to wind up their business but it was
confirmed later that many of the centres opened later in the evening.
  However, there was a two-hour delay during which undercover officers
from the council's enforcement unit monitored the activities of the areas
where there were illegal video games operators.
  The operation, led by MPPJ health department director Dr Abdul Rahim
Ahmad, caught the owner of a centre at Jalan 5/59 at Section 5 by
surprise.
  The 30 video game machines were then loaded into the waiting MPPJ
enforcement truck.
  Abdul Rahim said the operator, Rapi Permai Sdn Bhd had, applied for a
licence last August but the council rejected his application.
  "We will call the owner to our headquarters for further discussion and
let our legal department take over for further action," he said.
  Abdul Rahim said the operator who owned another licensed outlet in
Subang Permai, USJ, will be charged under the newly gazeted by-law which
provided for unlicensed video operators to be fined up to RM20,000 or
jailed for a maximum of five years or both.
  The operator will be the first video arcade owner in Petaling Jaya to be
charged under the enactment.
  The by-law covers all forms of entertainment including plays,
demonstrations and public performances.
  Licensed video arcades found to be operating illegal gambling machines
in their premises or failing to comply with regulations can be fined up tp
RM10,000 or jailed a maximum of three years or both.
  The council has given five illegal video operators in Petaling Jaya
Selatan 1, 2, 10 and 11, two in SS2 and one in Section 5 a week's grace to
cease operations.
  The notice expired last Friday.
  Abdul Rahim, who was assisted by the deputy superintendent of health
Ahmad Jaffar, is also temporarily heading the newly set up Entertainment
Licensing Unit.
  Health inspector Ong Poo Soong, public relations officer Norhayati
Sulaiman and her assistant Norshalizawati Baharudin were also present.
  The operation will continue for two months or until all illegal video
arcades are shut down.
  Confisticated items will be placed in storage at Kelana Jaya.
  Enforcement will be carried out phase by phase at legal and illegal
video and karaoke outlets in the township.
  Enforcement officers will be visiting karaoke centres for regular
inspections to see that the new rules are being adhered to.
  Under the new regulations, guest relations officers are banned from
working in the centres while tinted glasses will have to be removed.
  The council plans to call karaoke and pub operators for a meeting soon
to brief them on the new rules.
  With the gazetting of the by-law, MPPJ has taken over the licensing of
entertainment centres such as karaoke centres, pubs and discotheques from
the district office from Sept 1.

Fines reflect indifference to City Hall regulations

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

By Rosnazura Idrus

THE huge number of fines and compounds issued by City Hall for various
offences for the first half of this year show that the public is still
indifferent towards the rules and regulations set by the authority, Kuala
Lumpur Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said.
  Referring to the increase in the total of notices issued and collection
of compounds from January to July 1995 and 1996, he said awareness of the
rules and regulations among city dwellers was still low.
  The increase in the collection of compound was not a good sign though it
meant an increase in City Hall's revenue.
  "Our intention is not to collect as much money as we can but more
importantly, for the public to be aware of the rules and regulations and
abide by them," he said.
  From January to July this year, City Hall collected about RM6 million
from a total of 228,042 notices issued compared to RM5.6 million from
251,346 notices issued last year.
  Kamaruzzaman was speaking to reporters after the 27th City Hall
Directorate Day celebration at Taman Tasik Titiwangsa on Saturday.
  According to the statistics, compounds issued under the Road Transport
Ordinance (Metered Car Parks) Federal Territory 1984 recorded the highest
increase compared to last year.
  For the same period last year, City Hall collected about RM2.32 million
compared to RM2.79 million this year.
  The offences under this ordinance include indiscriminate parking,
parking outside the gazetted areas and causing road obstruction.
  "The figure shows the public's attitude of flouting the law," he
remarked.
  The second highest in collection this year was from offences under the
Street, Drainage and Building 1974 - RM1.26 million.
  But this showed a decrease from last year's RM1.58 million.
  The Earthworks by-law 1988 which was enforced in April this year
recorded a total of RM229,730 in collection for 1,479 compounds issued.
  Offences committed under this by-law cover dirtying of roads by lorries
carrying earth from construction site, carrying uncovered earth on lorries
and overloading.
  Kamaruzzaman said to date the Enforcement Directorate only has 1,200
enforcement officers.
  "We are still short of 400 enforcement officers and we plan to recruit
more.
  "But even with this number, we are still able to be effective in our
enforcement," he said.
  During the celebration last Saturday, a total of 82 officers were
awarded medals and certificates for various recommendations.
  The highest medals Pingat Khidmat Terpilih-Kelas 1 were given to two of
the horse unit advisers, Datuk A. Rahim Omar and Dr Bashir Fateh Mohamed.

Silently Yours reigns again

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 43

By Go-Ram

SILENTLY Yours proved beyond doubt that she is the champion among the
mares and fillies in the Malayan Racing Association circuit when she gave
a repeat performance to score a back-to-back victory in the S$150,000 NSF
Breeders' Vase over 1200m (Race 5) at Bukit Timah yesterday.
  Partnered by Saimee Jumaat, the five-year-old New Zealand-bred by Clay
Hero jumped smartly and positioned herself in third spot early behind
Golden Eagle II and My Sweet Partner.
  Once the field swung for home, Silently Yours quickly headed off Golden
Eagle and pulled away from her rivals to win by 5 1/2 lengths from Fancy
Lady (Chavez). Third was Princess Fury (Lisa) third with Andy's Polly
(Yin) fourth.
  Prepared by Donald Baertschiger for Silent Stable, she returned S$12 and
S$5 (RM14 and RM6) for her fourth success.
  Yesterday's event was the seventh occasion that Perkhidmatan Usaha Tegas
Sendirian Berhad sponsored a race at Bukit Timah.
  PUT is a Malaysian-based company with a successful track record in
providing telecommunications and broadcasting services.
  Imperial Gold II, the likely favourite for the S$650,000 Singapore Gold
Cup on Sunday, gave a stunning performance to win his warm-up race for
Class 1 sprinters over 1200m in Race 9.
  Ridden by Oscar Chavez, the four-year-old French-bred by Funambule last
early made his move at the turn for home where he swept past his rivals to
win by a head.
  Imperial Gold, trained by Mohamed Yusof, paid S$73 and S$16 (RM70 and
RM22).
  The day's races started with a shock when Caro Lad upset all
calculations to clinch the Class 3, Div 2 event over 1600m.
  Prepared by Mohamed Ismail and ridden by Azhar Ismail, Caro Lad paid
thumping dividends of S$467 and S$67 (RM280 and RM45).
  Apprentices Lee Soo Hin and Brethem Tai were involved in a fall in Race
8 yesterday.
  Lee escape injuries while Tai has been sent to hospital for X-rays and
observation.
  The going was good for the first two races, changed to yielding for Race
3 and soft for the remaining seven races.
