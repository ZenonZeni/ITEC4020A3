<HR>

<P>
 Admission into the
 Graduate Certificate Program in Software Systems Engineering
 is identical to that of the
 Master's degree in Software Systems Engineering.
 Each applicant must possess knowledge equivalent to the following
 undergraduate courses:
 structured programming in a modern programming language,
 data structures,
 discrete mathematics,
 and machine organization.
 The level of knowledge may also be achieved by taking the following
 George Mason University courses,
 which are referred to as the SWSE foundation courses:

 <B>
  <UL>
   <LI> INFS 501 Discrete and Logical Structures for Information Systems
   <LI> INFS 515 Computer Organization
   <LI> INFS 590 Program Design and Data Structures
  </UL>
 </B>

 In addition, it is desirable, but not necessary,
 for applicants to have at least one year of appropriate work
 experience in building and/or modifying software systems.

 Applicants are required to submit a brief
 (one- to two-page) statement of educational and work experience
 in the computing field that includes a self-assessment form,
 which can be obtained from the
 Department of Information and Software Systems Engineering.
 This form provides summary information concerning background and
 preparation for the program.

 For those students not enrolled in a graduate degree program at GMU,
 application for the certificate program in software systems engineering
 is made through the
 Graduate Admissions Office of the university.
 Students enrolled in a graduate degree program at GMU
 should apply to the 
 Department of Information and Software Systems Engineering
 for admission into the certificate program.
