<H2>Chapter 5: Invest in Science and Technology Advances</H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I>

<P>

Advances in science and technology contribute to the Nation's goals of economic growth, environmental quality, and national security. The Administration is pursuing a broad agenda of scientific research and technology development, effectively using national assets such as the national laboratory system and ensuring that scientific discoveries and technological advances move rapidly into U.S. and global markets.<BR>

<P>

Science and technology provide the essential foundation for economic prosperity. Investments in research and development (R&D) that spawn new technologies increase long-term productivity and high-wage job growth. This is especially true for energy technologies. Basic technologies, such as the electric motor, the internal combustion engine, and <a name="ifl"></a>incandescent and fluorescent lighting, have had a profound effect on the way we live and work today. Emerging technologies, like<a name="cells"></a>fuel cells, photovoltaics, <a name="gels"></a>aerogels, and <a name="wave"></a>radio-wave lighting, may have an equally profound effect on the way Americans live in the next century. <BR>

<P>

The technologies that we use to transform energy and materials into goods and services affect the amount of natural resources consumed, the types and amount of wastes produced, and the proportion of high-paying, high-tech jobs created in the economy. Because energy is so important to economic progress, energy R&D provides some of the highest national paybacks available for public expenditure. Advances in energy science and technology are critical to achieving the long-term economic, environmental, and national security goals of this Nation.<BR>

<P>

The Administration's science and technology policy emphasizes effective investments in energy R&D that will keep America in the forefront of providing sustainable energy technology for domestic and global markets. The demand for solutions through science and technology will only become more acute as the world population increases and competition for limited resources intensifies. Recent projections suggest that world demand for energy could increase by 50 percent over the next 25 years,5 and energy R&D must respond to these global pressures and opportunities. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="5.1">The Federal Role in Supporting Science and Technology</H4></a>

The Federal Government has traditionally supported a balanced portfolio of basic and applied research in a variety of disciplines. That balance is evident in energy R&D, where Federal support ranges from conducting long-term and high-risk energy research to assisting technology development and facilitating rapid diffusion of new technologies into the marketplace.<BR>

<P>

The Administration's energy R&D agenda is part of the larger national policy framework.  This policy framework is rooted in a strong belief that basic science provides the essential underpinnings for technology advances and that government can play a critical role in accelerating the development and deployment of technologies that serve the Nation's economic, environmental, and national security needs.<BR>

<P>

Whether conducted by private firms or government, R&D is an investment in the future and must compete with current spending priorities. Industry is the largest supporter of R&D in the Nation, providing about 52 percent of the total national R&D investment. However, it is estimated that more than 95 percent of the $107 billion industry will spend on R&D in 1995 will be for very low-risk projects. <BR>

<P>

While the private sector has always been more focused on near-term R&D, it is increasingly relinquishing its sponsorship of more basic and long-term research. Troublesome trends in private-sector R&D suggest that government must maintain its robust commitment to basic and applied R&D if the Nation is to retain its status as the world leader in energy-related science and technology. The recent Yergin Task Force report concludes that private-sector R&D in energy and energy-related areas has declined substantially over the past 10 years. At the same time, R&D spending by U.S. firms has shifted sharply toward near-term development (See Figure 16).<BR>

<P>

The Government must partner with industry to maintain the long-term research base that will support tomorrow's applied R&D by offsetting ominous trends toward shorter R&D time horizons. Federal support will help the United States remain competitive in the large and growing domestic and international market for sustainable, productivity-enhancing technologies. The cornerstone of the Administration's strategy is expansion and improvement in peer-reviewed competitive research, placing a high priority on cost-shared partnerships at all levels of applied R&D in efficient end-use energy technologies, renewable energy systems, fossil-fuel combustion systems, and nuclear technologies. Stakeholder involvement throughout the planning process provides the link to the marketplace. In an era of constrained Federal budgets, the Administration continues to pursue innovative efforts to enhance and leverage national science and technology assets.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="5.2">Basic Science and Energy Research: Building a Foundation for a Sustainable Energy Future</H4></a>

Advances in basic science improve our understanding of real-world phenomena and provide the basis for both revolutionary breakthroughs in technology and informed national policies that anticipate and mitigate the effects of energy choices on society. But such basic advances in knowledge or technology are not adequately rewarded in the market. The Administration continues its firm commitment to basic science and energy research where long-term potential for great scientific discovery compensates for a lack of immediate commercial interest.<BR>

<P>

Under this guiding premise, seven areas of basic research are of particular importance in helping to find new ways to conserve resources, develop new energy sources, control pollution, reduce waste in manufacturing, assess and predict the impacts of global climate change, develop innovative approaches to cleaning up hazardous waste sites, and to define the long-term human health and environmental risks from energy production and use. The seven basic research areas are the following:<BR>

<P>

Materials Science. New discoveries about the nature and properties of materials will result in significant energy savings and productivity gains. Research sponsored by the Department of Energy has resulted in such breakthroughs as metallic glasses; pollution-preventing lead-free solder; materials that offer superior properties for corrosion resistance, welding and joining, and high-rate and superplastic metal forming; solar photovoltaic cells; high-temperature ceramics and ceramic matrix composites; lightweight materials for batteries and fuel cells; and high-temperature alloys and superconducting materials.<BR>

<P>

Geosciences. Research focused on the behavior and properties of the outermost layers of the Earth's crust has contributed significantly to the development of underground imaging, computer modeling, experimental simulation, and remote sensing. These advances are critical to the discovery of new energy resources and the enhanced recovery of existing reserves, ranging from conventional fossil fuels to alternative energy sources such as geothermal and gas hydrides. <BR>

<P>

Energy Biosciences. Energy-related biotechnologies show great promise for improving energy productivity and environmental performance. Developing tomorrow's energy-related biotechnologies requires improving our basic understanding of biological processes. Research focuses on the basic mechanisms affecting plant productivity, conversion of biomass and other organic materials into fuels and chemicals by microbial systems, and the ability of biological systems to replace energy-intensive processes.<BR>

<P>

Chemical Sciences. Critical research into chemical properties and interactions provides insight into the chemistry involved in combustion processes, enabling increased combustion efficiency and improved environmental performance, as well as the development of new catalysts and catalytic processes. Catalytic processes help produce nearly 75 percent of chemical and petroleum products (by dollar value), and they are central to the prevention and remediation of environmental pollution and the conversion of solar energy to clean hydrogen fuels.<BR>

<P>

Biological and Environmental Science. Research on the environmental, physical, and safety risks related to the development and use of energy can help policymakers identify, understand, and anticipate the health and environmental effects of energy use. Fundamental research in physical, chemical, and biological processes contributes to the development of advanced monitoring and analysis systems that provide the foundation for addressing major biological, medical, and environmental problems.<BR>

<P>

Supercomputing and Modeling. Advancing the state of the art in computational techniques, such as the use of massively parallel supercomputing, can help probe basic questions regarding the effects of energy systems on the environment as well as aid research into new techniques and methods of energy production and conversion. These efforts can help solve mysteries both "large" (for example, by analyzing environmental and climatic phenomenon) and "small" (such as by developing and analyzing advanced materials at the molecular and subatomic levels and mapping the human genome).<BR>

<P>

Future Energy Sources. Research into fundamentally new, advanced energy sources such as hydrogen technologies and fusion energy can have substantial future payoffs. Because of ongoing research, hydrogen may serve someday as an energy carrier like electricity or as an end-use fuel like natural gas, or both. Similarly, the Nation's fusion program has made steady progress and last year set a record of producing 10.7 megawatts of power output at a test reactor supported by the Department of Energy. This development has significantly enhanced the prospects for demonstrating the scientific feasibility of fusion power, moving us one step closer to making this energy source available sometime in the next century.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="5.3">Technology Research and Development: Linking Science to Sustainable Energy Goals</H4></a>

Advances in science provide a critical foundation for a sustainable energy future, particularly as subsequent technology developments help maximize energy productivity, prevent pollution, and enhance national security. Strengthening the linkage between science and the market is important, not to displace the impetus of private R&D efforts but rather to accelerate the introduction of knowledge and technologies that respond to the Nation's goals and to the needs of markets. Appropriate partnerships with the private sector, and other methods to enhance the linkage between science and the marketplace, can maximize the contribution of Federal investments in science and technology research to attain sustainable energy goals.<BR>

<P>

Many of the specific technologies that are critical for a sustainable energy future are described elsewhere in this document. The overall strategy that motivates the Administration's technology R&D portfolio reflects the goals established in the Energy Policy Act of 1992<a name="box"></a>. Three other operational goals also guide our research agenda:<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>Encourage holistic, systems-level processes and technologies that support integrated resource efficiency, pollution prevention, and industrial ecology. These emerging concepts and techniques require industrywide participation in creative partnerships with government agencies to get beyond the pilot stage. If widely adopted, they have the potential to change the landscape of industrial America.<BR>

<P>

<li>Develop appropriate cost-sharing arrangements with industry to speed the development of specific technologies that increase energy efficiency, increase the use of clean-burning natural gas, and enhance the performance and lower the cost of renewable energy sources and other supply technologies that are smaller, cheaper, and less polluting. These programs focus on technologies with the highest potential payback from the standpoint of multiple national energy goals, where the private sector is less capable of providing the necessary R&D resources and where cost sharing ensures a high probability of market acceptance.<BR>

<P>

<li>Maintain leadership in technology research for future energy resource options that have not reached the commercial stage but hold the most promising long-term economic, environmental, and national security gains. For example, continued research into technologies that could accelerate the adoption of hydrogen energy systems could someday revolutionize the way we produce, distribute, store, and use energy.</ul>

<H4><a name="5.4">Enhancing and Leveraging National Assets</H4></a>

The U.S. science and technology enterprise is the largest in the world and has been recognized as one of the Nation's premier assets, a treasure that we must sustain and build on for the future. The scope of this scientific establishment is truly impressive, and it includes public and private institutions, individual researchers, and facilities and instrumentation located throughout the Nation. These investments in the capacity to do long-term, fundamental research deliver a steady stream of new knowledge and maintain our global leadership in science and technology. The Administration's policy is to continue strong support for strategic national science and technology assets, so they can serve our needs today and respond to the challenges of tomorrow.<BR>

<P>

In these times of constrained budgets, the Administration is ensuring that the national science and technology enterprise will meet our Nation's future needs by finding and adopting new and better ways to leverage scarce resources. These include pursuing tighter linkages between our public-sector, university-based, and private-sector research; collaborating with other nations on large-scale scientific initiatives; and coordinating and streamlining the Federal research system to maximize efficiency.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="5.5">The National Laboratories</H4></a>

The Department of Energy's national laboratories make up the largest research system of its kind in the world and form the backbone of the Nation's scientific and technological enterprise. They offer the expertise of 18,000 engineers and scientists performing world-class research in the pursuit of national security, an affordable, sustainable and productive energy future, and enhanced environmental quality. These laboratories feature centralized, generally large-scale facilities that perform R&D for which there is a strong public purpose and that cannot be maintained by academia or the private sector.<BR>

<P>

More than 15,000 industry, university, and government-sponsored scientists currently conduct unique, cutting-edge experiments at state-of-the-art Federal research facilities, including high energy and nuclear physics accelerators, neutron and light sources, and smaller facilities such as electron microscopy centers. The demand for the use of facilities such as the Department of Energy's accelerators for high energy and nuclear physics research, neutron sources, magnetic fusion facilities' supercomputers, and synchrotron light sources exceeds their availability. The Department's synchrotron light sources, alone, are used by more than 3,000 government, university, and private-sector researchers each year for work in the areas of semiconductors, polymers, alloys, superconductors, magnetic materials, structural biology, and pharmaceuticals. Administration policy encourages increasing access to these highly sought-after resources by providing additional funding to increase significantly and immediately the experimentation time available to researchers.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="5.6">The University Research Infrastructure</H4></a>

University capabilities are another important component of the Nation's science and technology assets. Universities are critical to maintaining our science and technology leadership because of their primary role in educating the next generation of scientists and engineers, their ability to provide low-cost, high-quality research, and their relative freedom from national security-related barriers to the flow of knowledge. While the national laboratories excel at "big science" and in areas where the ability to form large interdisciplinary research teams is essential, universities contribute substantially to the Nation's other important science goals. Research and development conducted at U.S. universities accounted for 5.7 percent of the total fiscal year 1993 R&D expenditures of $160.8 billion. The Department of Energy's direct investments in the universities are complemented by its support for the national user facilities at national laboratories. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="5.7">Maintaining Science and Technology Excellence</H4></a>

The intellectual resources of our national laboratories and the larger scientific community are far too valuable for future generations to lose. The Administration is committed to preserving national research capabilities through continued support of the research infrastructure. Key strategic areas needing support include robotics, alloys, ceramics, semiconductors, fuel cells, building technologies, bioremediation, batteries, and biomass and other renewable energy resources, in addition to the more traditional fields of high energy physics and nuclear physics.<BR>

<P>

Continued success in meeting our national science, energy, national security, and environmental quality goals also depends on the quality and quantity of our scientific and technical workforce. Thus, science, mathematics, and engineering education is a key component of maintaining U.S. excellence in science and technology and, by extension, international economic and technological competitiveness.<BR>

<P>

Linking, Coordinating, Streamlining. The National Science and Technology Council is the primary vehicle used to coordinate the use of the Nation's R&D infrastructure to meet current needs. Through the use of this structure, for example, the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce are effectively coordinating their activities with the three major U.S. automakers and their supplier companies in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, and the Department of Energy coordinates biofuels research with the Department of Agriculture. In addition, advances in information technology are creating new opportunities to link the research capabilities at each of the national laboratories to each other and to the university and private-sector R&D community. <BR>

<P>

Focusing on National Needs, Revisiting Structural Relationships. Changing world and domestic conditions present increasing challenges for successfully leveraging our national science and technology assets. In response to these realities, and with input from a variety of sources, the Administration is moving to strategically align science and technology actions with our national security, environmental quality, and economic productivity goals. This alignment will end unnecessary redundancies within the Federal science and technology enterprise and will yield savings by reforming contract and procurement practices, by reducing layers of management, and by privatizing, delegating, or eliminating assets that are no longer critical to the Nation's needs.<BR>

<P>

International Collaborations. Encouraging international collaboration on a variety of larger scale, high-cost, and experimental facilities is one way to leverage our Nation's research capabilities in selected areas. Although international collaboration on R&D projects risks diffusion of control of the research focus and many user facilities are already overburdened by excess demand, there are nonetheless great opportunities for the United States to share information, costs, and expertise with the larger international community<a href="ch7.html"> (See Chapter 7).<BR></a>

<P>

<H4><a name="5.8">Access and Communication: Capitalizing on Science Investments</H4></a>

To be more effective in bringing the results of scientific research and technology development to the market and to <a name="nation"></a>help our Nation capitalize on R&D investments</a>, Administration policy emphasizes communication and cooperation among public- and private-sector participants. Building on prior Administrations' efforts to improve technology transfer, the Administration is taking further steps to enhance cooperation among States, local governments, and community resources. The goal is to bring science and technology to successful market application through the formation of a seamless network of information and service providers.<BR>

<P>

This more decentralized approach to leveraging existing infrastructure will ensure that Federal science and technology, coupled with private-sector and university science and technology, will quickly find its way into the marketplace. Specifically, the Administration is working to improve the communication and possible synergy across the continuum of basic science, applied R&D, and commercial development by;<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>Making scientific results and breakthroughs more accessible to applied researchers for conversion to technologies<BR>

<P>

<li>Improving public access to information on new technologies<BR>

<P>

<li>Improving access to and the quality of science, mathematics, and engineering education<BR>

<P>

<li>Providing scientists with feedback on market needs and demands<BR>

<P>

<li>Improving industry access to cooperative technology programs of State and local governments, which are investing close to $400 million per year in these efforts.</ul>

 

R&D partnerships are an important vehicle for bringing scientists, engineers, and commercial developers together in productive undertakings. Large partnerships and R&D consortia offer extremely high leverage in bridging the gap between basic science and commercial products to benefit U.S. industry and the Nation. The traditional linear model of the research, development, and demonstration continuum has given way to a more enlightened and realistic model that integrates basic science, applied research, and commercial development into a blended, iterative process with better feedback from consumers and users throughout the process. This system relies on "real time" interactions among the participants, each bringing his or her own unique perspectives to problem solving.</BODY><HR>
