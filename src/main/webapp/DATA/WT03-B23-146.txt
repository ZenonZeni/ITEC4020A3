		<P>
				When a bond is initially sold, the issuer establishes a stated
				coupon rate that is determined by current market rates and is
				competitive with other income investments at the time. Once issued,
				the price of a bond in the secondary market will be influenced
				by any changes in the credit rating of the underlying issuer and/or
				changes in market interest rates. The coupon rate will always
				remain constant but the price of the bond will fluctuate according
				to any changes in the economy, supply of money and credit and
				inflation expectations. On any given day, a bond's market value
				may be higher or lower than the investor's original purchase price.
				Bonds selling at less than their par value are called discounted
				bonds; those selling above their par value are called premium
				bonds.

		<P>
				In general, bond prices and market interest rates have an opposite
				relationship. To form a better picture of the basic relationship,
				imagine a giant seesaw. Bond prices sit on one side and interest
				rates on the other. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall;
				when interest rates fall, bond prices rise. A new bond is initially
				offered with a competitive rate, but once issued, it becomes part
				of a giant pool of existing securities that can be traded in an
				open secondary market.
