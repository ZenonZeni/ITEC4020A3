from a UK contributor " hardware crypto is a dog as far as markets are concerned" <p>

&gt;&gt;Given that GCHQ's main mission these days is sigint support for the
&gt;&gt;FBI, it's hard to see how they could avoid involvement [on clipper]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Nonetheless, hardware crypto is a dog as far as markets are
&gt;&gt;concerned. The future is with software, and we held a workshop last
&gt;&gt;December of fast software encryption which elicited a dozen new
&gt;&gt;algorithms (including from the likes of Don Coppersmith, Jim
&gt;&gt;Massey and David WHeeler).
&gt;
&gt;(The proceedings of this workshop are to be published by Springer Verlag I
&gt;gather.)
