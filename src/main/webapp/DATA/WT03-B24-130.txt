<h2>Summary</h2>
One of the most significant things was obvious in
the parking lot.  Unlike September's meeting, this time it was empty.
Inside the hall, it was obvious that no one came. It was packed in
September, and now, entire rows were empty. I'm bad at guessing numbers,
but its easy  to guess that only 1/3 as many people showed. Maybe less.
<p>
The meeting was hosted by <a href=#Roback>Ed Roback </a>
of NIST, who quickly introduced
<a href=#Nelson>Mike Nelson</a> of the White House. 
Mike is clearly a political guy.
His handout says: "We believe that our proposal for exportable 64-bit key
escrow encryption meets these goals [the goals of VP Gore's letter to Rep
Cantwell, July 20, 1994]." He said that the criteria describe a solution,
but not the only solution.  He said it does not preclude other
implementations in the future. He anticipates that the State Department
will issue guidance based upon these criteria in "early 1996," and that
between now and then, any product that meets the criteria will be elegible
for expidited approval. Of course, the existing (slow as molasass) process
will continue.

<p>
I asked the first questions from the floor. The two questions were:
(1) Is this meeting concerned solely with export
of software, or does it deal with controling domestic use of strong
cryptography? and (2) since the 64-bit limit was severly criticized at
the Sept meeting, why is it still needed if there is also escrow?

<p>
His answer was that there is "no intention to control domestic encryption"
and on the 64-bit issue, that the government is "not certain it will
work." he says they "want to see it implemented and want to see
how it works" because 64-bit encryption is very strong. If the escrow
doesn't work, they don't want a lot of softare to be in widespread use.
<p>
He said that they have studied the encryption that is supposed to be widely
available on the Internet. He said that viewed by crypto experts, not
much is very good. He mentioned "two incidents" where Netscape had
weak implimentations. He feels that companies will not trust software
over the 'net. that they "want the US Government to say that 'this is
good enough'."
<p>
[I don't know what two incidents that he spoke of. There were four separate
noteworthy postings about Netscape, two were breaking RC4-40, Ian Goldberg
showed that the random seed was ineptly implemented, and Ray Cromwell
showed a trivial buffer overflow bug that could lead to serious 
security problems.]
<p>
Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed that
they were surprized at the industry concern over "one product" for
worldwide markets. There were lots of questions. He eventually admitted
that because of the "one product" concern, export regulations will effect
domestic products. [all the more reason for Netscape to keep building ten
or whatever it is.]
<p>
Brooks admitted that it is impossible to prevent multiple encryption.
Cypherpunks would do that by using PGP and then sending it using GAK.
He said "as a person, you can set up a secure communication method, and
nothing can be done about it." His concern is not that smart people can
have stronger crypto, but that strong crypto will be easy and widely used.
<p>
He said that the 64-bit key limit is not meant to restrict RSA keys to
64-bits, but rather to restrict the session keys that are encrypted using
RSA. Unspoken was the assumption that the 2000 bit RSA secret key would
have to be escrowed.
<p>
There were some interesting (and bad IMHO) implications of interoperability.
I'll cover them more in the long version. Basically, they admitted that
the interoperability restrictions made it stupid to have an export
version, you should have a strong domestic version, and an international
version developed offshore for sale to the rest of the world.
<p>
They admitted that there can be no controls over export of data, so once
interoperating software is available both domestically and from offshore
sources, there is no value in the export controlled, crippled version.
<p>
My favorite policeman, <a href=#GeoffG>Geoff Greiveldinger,</a> 
then described the
characteristics of an acceptable key escrow agent. There was a long list
of criteria, all unseen before the meeting. The general reaction
of the audience was that these were "yet another set of criteria that
must be met." Geoff claimed that they were simply trying to address
the questions raised at the earlier meeting about who is an
acceptable escrow agent. One point that caused a lot of concern
was that at least one employee of the escrow agent has to have a SECRET
clearence.
<p>
Industry, with a few exceptions, soundly said that this is a dumb idea,
that there is no market, that the criteria are too hard, etc. Except
Padgett Petersen, representing Lockheed-Martin. He said that LM thought
that the criteria were just peachy. The  usual civil liberties folks
also soundly trashed it.
<p>
There was a representative from Netscape. He said that they, as a company
think this is a terrible idea. They oppose it now, and will be issuing
a company policy soon. I didn't catch his name, and couldn't find him
to get the obviously carefully prepared text. 
<p>
One of what I thought were the most important admissions was made 
by Geoff G. in response to a question phrased about corporations
"holding their own keys." He was forced to admit that we
do "have a right to hold your own keys."
<a name="ProductCriteria">
<hr>
<h2>Product Criteria</h2>
This covers the product criteria, except interoperability.
<p>
There is a fair amount of information on the NIST web server. Use url:
<a href="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/">
http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/</a>
<p>
Nelson said that they have studied the encryption that is 
supposed to be widely available on the Internet.
He said that viewed by crypto experts, not much is 
very good. He mentioned "two incidents" where
Netscape had weak implementations. He feels that companies 
will not trust software over the 'net. that
they "want the US Government to say that 'this is good enough'."
<p>
Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed that they
were surprised at the industry concern over "one product" for worldwide markets.
<p>
He stated that they were addressing "not domestic policy, per se, but we
keep wrapping around" because of the 'one product' issue.
<p>
The criteria are on the NIST page,
<a href="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/">
url: http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/criteria.txt</a>

<p>
They handed out a guide to the changes in the criteria between September
and now. This is available from NIST as url:
<a href="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/bground.html">
http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/bground.html</a>

<p>
Here is a portion of it:
<ul>
<li> Old Criterion 1.     Moved to #7;
<li>Old Criterion 2.     Moved to #8;
<li>Old Criterion 3.     Split into #1 and #2
<li>Old Criterion 5.     Moved to #10
<li>Old Criterion 6.     Moved to #9;
<li>Old Criterion 7.     Moved to #5;
<li>Old Criterion 8.     Moved to #6;
<li>Old Criterion 9.     Deleted.
<li>Old Criterion 10.    Moved to #3;
</ul>
<p>
Only in Washington. Oh yeah, they also clarified a lot of the wording.
<p>
<h3>Ideas that I thought important enough to make notes of concerning the
criteria:</h3>
<p>
These criteria do not address either hardware nor non-escrow encryption.
Export controls of these are not changed, they can be exported with the
current procedures.
<p>
Brooks said that these rules are not applicable to the protection of
internal data for US corporations, even for overseas locations of US firms.
He said that getting permission to export for _internal corporate use_ is
easy, if it is to protect corporate secrets and for internal communication.
I took this to mean that a multi-national, US-based corporatgon can get a
permit for ViaCrypt and export it for their own use. [later in the day,
some people mentioned that this isn't nearly as easy as Brooks claimed.]
<p>
He said that the intent in the new wording is flexibility. They don't want
to prescribe implementation details, he wants industry to invent what
sells. He specifically stated that the meetings were not about setting
standards. This caused at least a fair amount of confusion, probably due to
the fact that NIST used to be called National Bureau of Standards, and NBS
set standards all the time. For example, a couple of folks were interested
in interoperability, say between a Netscape encryption system and one made
by, say, Microsoft. This meeting did not address this level of
interoperability.
<p>
about #2, <blockquote>"The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall be
inoperable until the key(s) is escrowed in accordance with #3."</blockquote>
Brooks said
that the intent was to allow vendors to make a single product that doesn't
activate the key-escrow function if not needed. The idea was that when the
keys are escrowed, the encryption engine would be activated. He also said
that "manufacturers may not want to be in the key escrow business" and
would therefore want to ship products that could be activated by a third
party escrow agent.

<p>
While talking about #3, 
<blockquote>3. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions' key(s)
shall be escrowed with escrow agent(s) certified by the U.S.
Government, or certified by foreign governments with which
the U.S. Government has formal agreements consistent with
U.S. law enforcement and national security requirements.
</blockquote>
<p>
He stated that this does not preclude the use of "other agents." This
became a major issue throughout the day. Ken Mendelson, staff attorney at
TIS, asked (roughly) "Under what authority does the US Government grant
certification to agents?" The response was a run around. Another hot issue
was whether you can "hold your own keys" rather than using a third party.
Seems that the corporate users are arguing that they want to hold their own
keys, and the government reacted to that favorably (not unfavorably?).
[Later in the day, Geoff Greiveldinger was asked if US citizens have the
right to hold their own keys. Geoff was forced to admit that, "yes, you can
hold your own keys"]
<p>
<blockquote> "5.    The product's key escrow feature shall allow access to the
key(s) needed to decrypt the product's ciphertext regardless
of whether the product generated or received the ciphertext."</blockquote>
<p>
Contains a significant change that was not discussed in September. It means
that having the key for either end is sufficient. Brooks conceded that this
was a big change, but claimed it was needed. The claim that one-ended
surveillance is easier is most likely true.  It clearly is easier if one
end is US based and using GAK and the other is foreign where there is
respect for civil liberties.
<p>
He even claimed that it made the system less intrusive: His argument was
roughly:
<blockquote>
Lets say they are snooping on me.  With one-ended, they can read all of my
messages, to and from, without needing the keys of my correspondents. (lets
pick Geoff G. as an arbitrary correspondent) With two ended, they'd have to
get both my key and Geoff's, and then they could read all of the messages
Geoff gets or sends.
</blockquote>
<p>
I said it was <i>their</i> argument. Seems to me to be groundless, unless they
got the keys of everyone in the chain, all of the folks that I talk to, all
of the folks that everyone I talk to, etc.
<p>
Several questioners asked if <i>any</i> will met criteria #5.
<a href=#Smid>Miles Smid</a> described a trick for meeting Criteria #5, 
if you encrypt the session key with your own public 
key, in addition to the key of your destination, and 
if you have escrowed your private key with an Escrow 
Agent, then nearly any approach meets criteria #5.
<p>
<blockquote>"7.    The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall use
an unclassified encryption algorithm with a key length not
to exceed sixty-four (64) bits."</blockquote>
<p>
This is really aimed at session keys, or at least non-RSA keys. I suggested
that they really needed some wording that make it clear.
<p>
He said that the 64-bit key limit is not meant to restrict RSA keys to
64-bits, but rather to restrict the session keys that are encrypted using
RSA. Unspoken was the assumption that the 2000 bit RSA secret key would have to be escrowed.
<p>
<blockquote>"8.    The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall not
provide the feature of multiple encryption (e.g., triple-
DES)."</blockquote>
<p>
He pointed out that the wording used to say "prevent" and now just says
"not provide".  He acknowledged that "prevent" was impossible.
<p>
<blockquote>"9.    The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall
interoperate only with key escrow cryptographic functions in
products that meet these criteria, and shall not
interoperate with the cryptographic functions of a product
whose key escrow encryption function has been altered,
bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative."
</blockquote>
<p>
Brooks said that this was intended to allow multiple modes, such as
compatibility with other encryption schemes. Of course, he said, the other
modes are subject to export restrictions.
<p>
Somewhere in the discussion, Ed Appel took over for Brooks. Appel is
"Director of Counter Intelligence Programs, National Security Council, The
White House" He was introduced as FBI.
<p>
Ed Appel: the LEA’s are very interested in Criteria #5 
(two ended decryption) as they have more than 100 
international offices.
<p>
There were some interesting (and bad IMHO) implications of interoperability.
I'll cover them more in the next section
<a name="Interoperability">
<hr>
<h2>Interoperability Issues</h2>
Part 2 of three hasn't been written, it is supposed to 
address the issues related to interoperability. I 
decided it was better to get this part out than to 
wait.

<a name="AgentCriteria">
<hr>
<h2>Key Escrow Agent Entity Criteria</h2>
<p>
Geoff G. says that the discussions on agent criteria 
are simply a follow-on to the main criteria #3.
The criteria themselves have been spam'd to the list.
They are also available at url:
<a href="http:/www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nist/escagent.html">
http:/www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/nist/escagent.html</a>
<p>
There was a lot of reactions to the SECRET clearance
requirement, which they claimed was to handle
secure investigations (e.g. FISA). 
The logic is that since some investigations are classified,
and since you can't even see a classified document 
unless you have a proper clearance, each Key Escrow Agent Entity,
must have at least one properly cleared employee. This
was not a popular requirement.
<p>
David Lesher asked a series of questions concerning 
the requirement that the Key Escrow Entity employ a 
person with a SECRET clearance. They included: what 
agency will issue the clearance? Who will authorize 
for the BI (background investigation)? Who will pay 
for it? Who does the existing RBOC clearances? Geoff 
dodged nearly all of them. He acknowledged that "they" 
will have to pay, but made no effort to define who 
"they" are.
<p>
Geoff said that they may want legislation support for 
protecting against illegal release of keys, failure to 
release, etc.
<p>
A fair number of the agent criteria would be considered
professional business practice (no single point of
failure, dual locations, etc.) if you thought that
escrowing keys was a good thing.
<p>
<a name="Presentations>
<hr>
<h2> User/Industry presentations</h2>
<h3>Bill Sweet of TIS</h3>
Bill gave a presentation about his CKE product, and 
how hard he is working to "find a global solution."
<p>
This is actually the same product that Bill talked 
about in September when he worked for National 
Semiconductor. It was impressive then (private keys 
are NOT escrowed, only session keys, etc.) and is 
still not approved for export.
<p>
Bill talked about "information owners," they 
ultimately decide which security systems get deployed 
"in spite of various government requirements around the 
world." He said that "if rational key escrow systems 
are not offered, or do not adequately protect their 
information, owners will use unescrowed encryption 
from whatever sources available (Germany, et al)."
<p>
Bill talked about a UK University (Royal Holloway) 
study on UK/European needs for key escrow. He said 
that there was a lot of overlap with the NIST 
criteria, but that there were criteria that were 
judged as totally unacceptable. The first and loudest 
finding was:
<p>
"the use of the scheme should provide visible benefits 
to the user."
<p>
This begs the obvious question, what 
visible benefits to the user does GAK bring?
<p>
Two other interesting findings in the study were:
<ul>
<li> An entity with a warrant should not be able to 
fabricate false evidence."
<li> Abuse by either side should be detectable by the 
other.
</ul>
He suggested that these criteria be added to the NIST 
list of 10.
<p>
Bill went on to look at the NIST criteria. He said, 
concerning Criteria #3 (agents certified by US 
Government or reciprocal agreement), that "this is a 
show stopper!" because:
<ul>
<li>no reciprocal agreements exist today, anywhere.
<li>what about countries where justice systems are 
different, and what about where "these agreements are 
not desirable (e.g. Nigeria, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, 
Argentina, Poland, etc.)?
<li> even for NATO countries, agreements will be 
different (Germany has data privacy laws, in Greece), 
or we may not want to be reciprocal (in Greece, the 
government likes to bug the opposition)
</ul>
He also says that Criteria #7, 64-bit keys, is 
unacceptable. CE Infosys currently sells a PCMCIA (PC 
Card) encryptor that does triple-DES at T1 speeds. TIS 
uses it, and sells it in the US. [as an aside, I was 
told that they can import and resell them, but when 
one breaks, TIS can’t ship it back to Germany for 
repairs. Sigh.]
<p>
Sweet had two recommendations:
<ul>
<li>develop a tiered crypto policy, with hardware and 
software under differing levels of rules,
<li> allow a pilot project, where TIS can sell VPN 
(virtual private networks) using strong encryption. A 
VPN is the use of the Internet as a private network 
for a corporation by adding appropriate firewalls, 
encryption, etc.
</ul>
It seems to me that while TIS' CKE doesn't meet the 
criteria, it could be made to, with a few changes.
They've have to change the design to allow GAK
for any one target. (Criteria #5) This would mean
for generating one DRF (ie., LEEF) for each recipient 
as well as for the sender (as opposed to just for 
the sender) The neat thing about CKE is that each 
LEEF holds only the session key -- so you never 
give away your private key. (I think the govenment
really expects that we'll be willing to 
escrow our private keys. Fat chance!)
<p>
But this is a bit of a catch 22, because 
to follow all the criteria, you can't stop there.
<ul>
<li>For each encryption, you generate a DRF for the 
sender and each recipient
<li>
For each DRF generated, you must have and check 
a certificate chain for the chosen DRC and 
refuse to encrypt unless all recipients and 
the sender have validly certified (ie., USGovt
approved) DRC public keys.
<li>
Each receiving application must refuse to 
decrypt unless every other recipient and 
the sender have validly certified DRC
public keys. This gets into the interoperability
issues that I need to write up...
<li>
I don't know how they can meet the revised #6. It
seems to be designed specifically to break CKE.
</ul>
To get govie approval, each DRC needs to meet all the
key escrow agent entity criteria. I'm really not at
all convinced that it is actually practical. This is
sad, because CKE is obviously designed with the spirit
of the government at heart, with just some modifications
to make it marketable. Guess TIS needs an Ireland office 
too.
<p>
<h3>Ken Mendelson of TIS</h3>
Ken gave a solid presentation describing how all of 
the Government’s need for data about key escrow agents 
could be met with a commercial "vendor registration" 
approach instead of a Government mandated 
"certification" scheme. This would be in keeping with 
the current "spend less money, have less government 
bureaucratic rules" political climate. I have copies 
of his slides, I’d rather not type them in. With any 
luck, he’ll put them up on the TIS web site url: 
http://www.tis.com
<p>
<h3>Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University</h3>
<p>
Dorothy Denning gave a presentation based upon an article that 
will be published in the March 96 Communications of 
the ACM. It analyzes currently available products (and 
vapor products) and sees how well they meet Criteria 
#5. It says that eight of the sixteen approaches that 
she surveyed currently meet Criteria #5. She lists her 
web page as http://www.cosc.georgetown.edu/~denning, 
but as of Sunday 12/10, the text is not available.
<p>
<h3>Melanie Janin, US Council for International Business</h3>
Ms. Janin’s speech presented the US Council for 
International Business’ comments on GAK. They are a NY 
based trade group, representing 300 clients. They 
don’t like GAK. She called for a coherent policy on 
all encryption. Major topics in the presentation 
include:
<ul>
<li>free choice
<li>open to the public
<li>international acceptance
<li>flexibility of implementation
<li>User key management
<li>Key escrow (where they "embrace key escrow as one 
possible method of managing encryption keys.")
<li>Liability
</ul>
<h3>Ed Scheidt, Tecsec</h3>
Presented both comments on the criteria and his 
company’s VEIL and Export VEIL Version 2.0 products. 
He raised a number of points, including:
<ul><li>how do we protect our commercial information unless 
we have the best cryptography?
<li>we need "constructive key management technology" to 
manage keys, key splits, and different algorithms for 
extended data separation.
<li>solution must address issues such as international 
trust in a key escrow.
</ul>
He said that his "Export VEIL 2.0" product meets "the 
intent of 11/95 export criteria today."
<p>
<h3>Daniel Weitzner of CDT</h3>
<p>
Mr. Weitzner agreed to shorten his presentation so 
that he could yield some time to VTW.
<p>
He opened by pointing out that while the schedule had 
both him and Jerry Berman were supposed to talk, Jerry 
was too busy to make the meeting. "Jerry is out 
defending pornographers, so I’ll be here defending 
terrorists."
<p>
I expect that his text will be on CDT’s webpage, url: 
http://www.cdt.org. I’ll just enter the key points.
<p>
The first thing he said is that "this is the wrong 
forum" and that "the [NIST] process will not work." He 
proposed a open, privately sponsored forum to develop 
alternatives that will work.
<p>
"The NIST proposal will not provide adequate security, 
privacy, promote secure communications worldwide, or 
guarantee user privacy." Major issues are:
<ul>
<li>Inadequate security
<li> No viable policy framework for the long-term
<li> Hinders the deployment of globally interoperable 
secure systems
<li> not necessarily voluntary
<li> not viable in the marketplace
<li> no constitutional privacy protections
<li> will not meet the needs of law enforcement, since it 
will "not deny criminals or terrorists access to 
strong encryption, the stated objective of the 
policy."
</ul>
<h3>Shaber Safdar, Voters Telecommunication Watch</h3>
Described the results of an Internet-based, non-
scientific survey that the VTW recently made. Not 
surprisingly, those who replied were overwhelmingly 
against the NIST proposal. I don’t have the slides, 
but VTW has a website with most of their information. 
The url is <a href="http://www.vtw.org">
http://www.vtw.org</a>
<p>
There were 26 respondents to the survey. 24 out of 26 
said that they would never buy products with law 
enforcement access. 16 out of 24 are already using 
security products.
<p>
He described a Technology Pledge that VTW is 
presenting to politicians (available at url: 
<a href="http://www.vtw.org/pledge/">
http://www.vtw.org/pledge/)</a> and stated that Rep. 
Ronald Wyden (D-OR) signed the pledge with pro-
freedom, pro-market answers.
<h3>David Sobol, EPIC</h3>
As expected, EPIC doesn’t like much about the NIST 
proposal. Their comments are on their web page, url:
<a href="http://www.epic.org/crypto/EPIC_Statement.html">
http://www.epic.org/crypto/EPIC_Statement.html</a>
<p>
A key statement is "Given the reality that users are 
unlikely to adopt key escrow systems on a voluntary 
basis, we believe that the current policy will result 
in the eventual prohibition of non-escrowed products. 
Indeed, documents released to EPIC under the Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA) reveal that NSA and FBI 
concluded nearly three years ago that
<blockquote>
‘Technological solutions such as they are, will 
only work if they are incorporated into all 
encryption products.’"
</blockquote>
Major points 
<ul>
<li>Public comment is frequently solicited but never 
heeded.
<li>Relevant information has not been released. 
<li>The proposal conceals the attempt to expand 
wiretapping capability 
</ul>
As a result, EPIC proposes the following Policy 
Recommendations
<ul>
<li>Relax export controls on encryption and permit the 
free flow of encryption products across national 
borders
<li>Withdraw FIPS 185 (the Clipper standard for voice, 
fax,...  and low speed data networks in the 
federal government)
<li>Remove "cryptology" from items that may be 
classified ...  under executive order
<li>Do not fund the Telephone Carrier Compliance Program         
(the "Digital Telephony" proposal)
<li>Do not permit the use of classified algorithms for         
public networks
<li>Examine the activities of the National Security 
Agency ... since passage of the Computer Security 
Act of 1987.
</ul>
NOTE: during Mr. Sobel’s discussion, a FBI 
representative sitting at the head table said  that 
the issues addressed by key escrow are "not just 
wiretapping, they include search and seizure of all 
stored media." I was not able to identify the person. 
He was sitting at Ed Appel’s seat, but did not have a 
namecard. No one sitting near me recognized him 
either.
<h3>Padgett Petersen, Lockheed Martin</h3>
Noted Internet personality, Padgett Petersen took a 
rarely held position, he spoke as a Security officer 
of Lockheed Martin, rather than speaking as a private 
net-citizen.
<p>
He said that "these criteria are acceptable and can be 
made to work." He also said that "without US 
agreements, there is no reason to be concerned with 
export." Lockheed Martin was looking forward to 
participating in using and buying the escrowed 
products that will hit the market as a result of this 
process.
<h3>Robert Hollyman, Business Software Alliance</h3>
Mr. Hollyman said that "the facts are clear, companies 
are unanimous against" the NIST proposal. His members 
agree that:
<ul>
<li> security is critical
<li> 40 bit is not viable
<li> the 1992 government review requires a change in 
policy.
<p>
He recommended:
<li> immediate approval of DES or equal strength 
alternative for export.
<li> encourage companies to build encryption software by 
submitting code to NIST (under non-disclosure) for 
review
<li> add two bits ever three years to allowable key 
lengths in recognition of Moore’s law. He called this 
a COCA allowance (cost of cracking algorithms).
<li> removal of restrictions on interoperability because 
they are artificial and antithetical to the Global 
Information Infrastructure.
</ul>
He stated that the current criteria are vague, and 
will take years for approval. Yet he notes that in 
industry, the average life cycle of software is 18 
months.
<h3> Alex McIntosh, PC Security</h3>
PC Security sells key management systems. Shell is a 
customer. He addresses a couple of areas that his 
commercial customers ask. 
<p>
The first question is "why encrypt?" He said that the 
answer is to protect confidential data. These data 
include email, PC files, and archival data. 
<p>
This leads to the obvious question, why use key 
management? The two separate answers are to have  
operational backup and to allow compliance with 
internal and external law enforcement.
<p>
He said that he has a surprise for the NIST folks 
concerning key escrow agents. The corporate customer 
is the key escrow agent.
<p>
Other key observations:
<ul><li> Companies, such as Shell, often do business in 
countries where they can not trust the government.
<li> Shell handles over a million email messages a day. 
This defines engineering requirements for any system 
to meet.
<li> Liability is a huge issue, and the amounts are 
huge. Geologic information, market strategies, etc. 
are worth staggering amounts of money. The "US 
Government can NOT cover Shell’s liabilities."
</ul>
<h3>Doug Miller, Software Publishers Association</h3>
Mr. Miller said that his members need immediate relief 
from the current encryption export policies. "our 
members are poised, but cannot leap, because of the 
barriers that U.S. cryptographic policy continues to 
impose." He wants to be able to export 56-bit DES. His 
position paper says, "we believe the discussion should 
also include assessment of the exportability of 
products employing the DES algorithm. DES-strength 
(56-bit) products can compete with 179 foreign 
products (80 of which are software products) that 
employ DES. Liberalization of the export restrictions 
of software with encryption capabilities is essential 
if U.S. companies are to compete with strong, widely 
available non-escrowed products."
<h3> Viktor Hampel, Hampel Consulting </h3>
Proposed "a ‘Consumer Protection Act for Digital 
Products’ to support electronic commerce and to 
control the increasing abuse and lack of security on 
the national information highways." A copy can be 
obtained from Hampel Consulting, 1515 Jefferson Davis 
Highway, Crystal Square Suite 913, Arlington VA 22202-
3312.
<p>
In his remarks, Mr. Hampel said that trust is 
important between business. Business worries about 
issues as varied as what accountability is in the 
system and how much is the per minute interest on a 
billion dollar money transfer? These cause business to 
need solutions that NIST hasn’t raised.
<p>
He recommended that a public key infrastructure be 
included into the Uniform Commercial Code.

<H2> Closing comments.</h2>
Mike Nelson noted that the meeting had some time for 
floor questions.
<p>
He was asked what is the timeframe for finishing the 
process. He danced, saying that promising a fixed date 
for policy decisions is bad for your career, but 
thought it would be done in a couple of months.
<p>
Someone asked about the "Personal Use" export process 
(the one that will allow you to export PGP on a laptop 
computer for personal use, and that was promised for 
"in a couple of weeks" at the September NIST meeting). 
They said that it is about to go to the Federal 
Register, and should be available within weeks.
<p>
Nelson was asked about foreign escrow agents. He said 
that "if there exists bilateral diplomatic agreements, 
then the US will allow specification of Foreign Escrow 
agents." [Of course, no such agreements exist now.]
<p>
Ed Appel of the White House said that the intent is to 
make export "as easy as 40-bit" is under the existing 
policies. The existing export policies will continue.
<p>
He also said "so far, we are only controlling export" 
and that "the government has very strong cryptography 
available to them, so they are not worried about 
export." He said they hope to control export in two 
ways, first by applying the combined purchasing power 
of the US Government to encourage the market, and by 
controlling export.
<hr>
After the meeting closed, I invited both Mike Nelson 
and Ed Appel to the next <a href="http://www.isse.gmu.edu/~pfarrell/dccp/">
DC Cypherpunks meeting. </a>
Somehow I expect it when they declined. But they
both said they were interested in future meetings.
We'll see if they were just being polite.

<h2>Who is Who amongst the Government folks</h2>
<ul>
<li><a name="Appel">Ed Appel's card says <br>
Director of CounterIntellegence Programs<br>
National Security Council<br>
The White House
<p>
He is clearly a very smart law enforcement guy.
<p>
<li><a name="GeoffG">Geoff Greiveldinger is 
listed in the agenda as being with "U.S. Department
of Justice." He is clearly very high up in the organization. All of
the examples he gives are domestic, so he is probably FBI instead of NSA.
He also constantly refered to "equipment" instead of software.<p>
<li><a name="Nelson">Mike Nelson's card says <br>
Michael R. Nelson, PhD.<br>
Special Assistant, Information Technology<br>
Executive Office of the President<br>
Office of Science and Technology Policy<br>
OEOB (Old Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds)
<p>
He is a geophysist by degree. An impressive politician.
<p>
<li><a name="Roback">Ed Roback works at NIST. He coordinated
these meetings. After the meetings, a number of us kidded him
about "comming out" and admiting that he really is
only doing this because NSA insists.<p>
<li><a name="Smid">Miles Smid works at NIST. He is rumoured to have
been the brains behind the design of the Clipper system. He knows
a lot about cryptography. Other rumours say he learned about
Cryptography while employed at NSA.

<h2>Pat's Opinions</h2>
The meeting was in general a repeat of September's meeting, and similar
meetings that have been going on for years. Both sides talk past each
other. I think this has degenerated into a parallel with the abortion
debate. There is no common ground.
<p>
The biggest items that I heard was the admission by Geoff G. that 
we do have "the right to hold your own keys." This admission
means that they know they have no expectation that outlawing
unescrowed encryption is constitutional. This, sadly, doesn't mean
that they won't try.
<p>
<h3>What I think it means:</h3>
<p>
I believe that the government deeply wants to restrict domestic use of
strong encryption, but they have no legal justification for doing so.
They can't expect that they will get it if they go to Congress. So they
are attempting an end-arround using the export criteria, which they
<strong>do control.</strong> 
They hope that the pain of having multiple versions will be
so high that no vendor will bother, and all we'll have is crippled
software.
<p>
The usual civil liberties lobby folks (CDT, EPIC, etc.) want to
hold their own, industry sponsored meetings to develop workable systems.
<p>
I think that the real key is for everyone, worldwide to insist on
both strong crypto and interoperability. The Germans are already
writing fine software and making fast hardware. Microsoft and Netscape
can easily afford to do some of their development offshore. If the products
sell and are deployed, it won't matter what the govies want.
