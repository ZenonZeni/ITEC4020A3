</center>
<P>
The <a href="http://www.paltech.com/ttc/nha/">National Hydrogen 
Association (NHA)</a> advises members on the most 
current opportunities for developing and using hydrogen as a fuel.  NHA 
also works 
with industry and others to identify the institutional, regulatory, and 
nontechnical 
issues that must be resolved before commercial markets for hydrogen can 
emerge.  
NHA projects include assessing the production, transport, and use of 
hydrogen by 
region; identifying industry's interest in developing hydrogen as a 
commercial fuel; 
determining NASA's interest in hydrogen vehicle demonstrations; and 
assessing 
the feasibility of building a hydrogen pipeline from the southeastern 
states to 
southern California.  The NHA also develops demonstration projects that 
can result 
in public and private partnerships to develop hydrogen as a fuel of the 
future.
<P>
Information exchange and transfer are important activities of the NHA.  
Publications distributed to members include the <I>H2 Digest</I> and the 

<I>Legislative Update.  </I>A quarterly newsletter that will be a forum 
for NHA member 
activities is also planned.  Information exchange among industry members 
is facilitated by the NHA's participation in technical meetings.  The 
association also develops exhibits, papers, and presentations for 
industry and the public.  The chief means of disseminating information is 
the NHA Annual Hydrogen Meeting; held in the spring, it draws experts in 
the field from all across North America.
<P>
The NHA is also the focal point for the development of codes and 
standards for the 
commercial use of hydrogen as an energy source.
<P>
<b><I>Recent Activities</I></b>:
<P>

The premiere issue of the NHA's quarterly newsletter, <I>NHA 
Advocate</I>,

was distributed to approximately 125 NHA members and DOE officials.

 And the March/April issue of the <I>H<sub>2</sub> Digest</I> was also 
distributed to 

approximately 125 individuals.

<P>

The NHA exhibited at the Renewable Energy Expo hosted by the House

Renewable Energy Caucus.  As part of the exhibit, NHA recruited

a scientist to demonstrate the properties of hydrogen and an industry

representative to demonstrate a &quot;hydrogen-powered, manned-portable,


fuel cell power system&quot; that powered a TV and VCR at the

exhibit.

<P>

The 7th Annual U.S. Hydrogen Meeting was held April 2-4, 1996.

 This year's meeting was one of the most successful in the history

of the NHA; 200 representatives from industry, small business,

government, research, and nonprofit institutions attended.  The

wrap-up of the 7th Annual Meeting continued into May.  Collection

of papers for the final proceedings has begun.  Planning for the

8th Annual U.S. Hydrogen Meeting has also begun.  A &quot;Call

for Papers&quot; flyer should be distributed at the DOE Hydrogen

Program Annual Review Meeting.

<P>

 A draft agenda was prepared for an Executive Committee Planning Meeting


for the Industry Plan Workshop scheduled for June.  The agenda was 

sent to the Chairman of the Board for review and suggestions.  The codes 


and standards workshop was held May 30-31.  The NHA Executive Committee 


and other key hydrogen safety, codes, and standards experts were 
consulted on the

workshop's agenda.
