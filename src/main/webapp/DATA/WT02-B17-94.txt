<H2>Technology Development and Validation</H2>
<br>

<p>Researchers and other DOE-funded staff members who are engaged in 
technology development and validation work with scientists in 
universities, other 
agencies, and industry on research projects designed to minimize the 
technical and 
commercial risks that are associated with almost any new energy 
technology.  Their 
goal is to develop and validate advanced processes and technologies that 
will allow 
us to efficiently produce, store, transport, and use hydrogen as an 
energy carrier 
and fuel.  Through interactions with other federally funded programs, the 
DOE 
Hydrogen Program is able to stretch the nation's energy research dollars 
in a well-
planned, collaborative research and development program.</p>
<p>Technology development and validation efforts under the DOE Hydrogen 
Program focus on these three areas:  <I>production, storage and 
transport,</I> and 
<I>use.</I>  Brief summaries of projects in each area are included in 
this 
section.
