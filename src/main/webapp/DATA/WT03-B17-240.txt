<PRE>     Only  ants instill more hate and fear than cockroaches. They  have
been  called by many names, " The Rats  of the insect world"  for  one.
Cockroaches belong to the order Blattoidea (family Blattidae), and  can
live  up to a year. The Female lays several egg cases containing 30-50 eggs
ea.  during  her life time. Some varieties carry their egg  cases  with
them  and  place  them  for hatching later. Cockroaches  utilize  their
antennae to pick up chemical signals from the air. This helps  them  in
keeping  away from any synthetic chemical used against them. What  this
means  is  that cockroaches will detect pesticides and avoid the  area.
They  also  sample food stuffs before eating to detect pesticides  used
against  them.  This is why using chemicals against them is  fruitless.
Cockroaches  have  memories as good as the ants'. They remember
where  your food  stuff  is at and how to get at it. They also remember
where  they hide  that last morsel.  Like the ant, they  have developed
immunity to many pesticides. They are very active at night.

     Since  the days of cavemen, roaches have shared their home  with  humans.
Cockroaches will live in almost any environment. They can be  found  on
board  ship, near food areas, bathrooms. Their eggs are good travelers,
hitchhiking  on board containers en route. Air travel doesn't  bother
them.  They will thrive any where the moisture, temperature and  amount
of food available falls within tolerable boundaries.
     Like  the  ant, a cockroach is capable of traveling many miles  in
one  day.  They can move  through the cracks in walls. Where  they  go,
their  eggs follow. A cockroach can live without food for three  months
and without water for over thirty days. Their egg cases can survive for
years under the right conditions.
     There are over 4,000 species of cockroaches known; 57 are found in
the  United  States. Cockroaches have existed since  the  Paleozoic Era
which  is  about 400 million years ago. Only 6 species in the  USA  are
considered bad household pests.
