<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> <img src="blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>Purpose</b> </p>

<p> The purpose of this manual is twofold: first, to analyze the
arguments employed by proponents of drug legalization or
decriminalization;1 and second, to provide arguments necessary to
defeat these positions. </p>

<p> <b>Structure</b> </p>

<p> This manual is divided into chapters, each chapter addressing
a different argument used by the &quot;legalizers.&quot; For
example, Chapter One addresses the argument that legalizing drugs
would reduce the addiction rate; Chapter Two addresses the impact
that legalizing drugs would have on the crime rate. Furthermore,
each chapter is divided into two parts. The first part, termed
the &quot;Discussion&quot; section, briefly states the
legalizers' arguments and then provides an in-depth analysis of
how to defeat them. </p>

<p> The second part of each chapter is termed the &quot;Summary
Sheet&quot; section. The Summary Sheet section is designed for
people who for whatever reason do not have time to read the
Discussion section - for example, those people who actually are
involved in a debate at that moment. The Summary Sheet section is
divided into two columns, the first titled &quot;If They
Say,&quot; and the second called &quot;Then You Say.&quot; The
Summary Sheet section basically iterates the factual highlights
of the Discussion section in a format that is easy to &quot;just
pick up and use.&quot; In both the Discussion and the Summary
Sheet sections, relevant facts will be footnoted or otherwise
cited. This is so that if anyone asks you where you got your
information, you will be able to tell them immediately. </p>

<p> Appendix One suggests a structured format for an actual
public debate. Following these rules will prevent the debate from
disintegrating into a shouting match and a forum for
&quot;speeches&quot; from the audience. </p>

<p> Finally, an extensive bibliography is provided for your
convenience should you choose to pursue additional reading. </p>

<p> 1 For purposes of this manual, &quot;legalization&quot; means
a policy whereby selling and using drugs is legal.
&quot;Decriminalization&quot; means a policy whereby penalties
for breaking the drug laws are lessened and/or the drug laws are
restricted in scope. See Ralph A. Weisheit and Katherine Johnson,
&quot;'Exploring the Dimensions of Support for Decriminalization
of Drugs,&quot; Journal of Drug Issues, Winter 1992. That is, if
heroin were legalized, it would be legal to sell or use it. If
heroin were decriminalized, it technically would be illegal to
use it, but (for instance) the penalty for its use would be a $10
fine. Another example of decriminalization would be allowing the
use of heroin as a common pain killer in hospitals. </p>

<h2>Introductory Pointers </h2>

<p> <img src="blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Before getting to the substance of the legalization debate
itself, here are three suggestions for use when debating the
legalizers. </p>

<p> <b>1.</b> <b>Right to expect benefits. </b>As with any
policy, you have a right to demand that the legalizers prove that
the benefits of their proposal outweigh its costs. </p>

<p> <b>2.</b> <b>Right to specificity. </b>As with any policy,
you have a right to demand that the legalizers provide a specific
proposal which to debate. One cannot talk about policy in the
abstract. For example, let's say that you were debating whether
the federal government should cut spending - you have to have
some idea of what is to be cut, how much is to be cut, when it is
going to be cut, etc. With regard to the legalization debate, you
should ask your opponent these questions <i>at the beginning of
the debate:</i> </p>

<ul>
    <li>What drugs are we talking about? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are they advocating legalization or decriminalization? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are there limitations on who can use these drugs - what
        about children, pregnant women, prison inmates, police,
        members of the military, people who drive buses or fly
        planes, etc.? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Are there limitations on the quantity or potency of drugs
        that the individual can use? Would an unlimited supply of
        drugs be made available to the habitual users or drug
        addicts? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Who will create, market, and sell the drugs? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>How much will the drugs cost? Will the drugs be taxed,
        and if so, at what rate? </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Will drug addiction be able to be used as a defense in
        civil or criminal trials? </li>
</ul>

<p> Make sure that your opponent answers these questions early!
After all, it is only fair that you know what you are debating
before you begin the debate. </p>

<p> <b>3. Right to sources of information. </b>You have a right
to ask the legalizers the source of their data. By the same
token, they have the right to ask the same of you (and that's why
this manual is complete with footnotes). </p>

<p> Bearing these pointers in mind, we begin with an analysis of
legalization and addiction rates. <br>
