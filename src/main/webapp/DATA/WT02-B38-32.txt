PAYBACK TIME FOR MEXICO?

Mexico roared into the markets with its first deals of the year,
raising more than $1 billion last week from some of the same investors who
decried the country as untouchable just a year ago. The sovereign easily
raised DM 1 billion Monday with its first ever 7-year DM issue, equal to
$690 million. The state bank Nafinsa raised $100 million Wednesday and the
import-export bank Bancomext issued $300 million in commercial paper.
        But top Mexican financial officials denied that the country is
using the sovereign cash expressly to make any of the $1.3 billion in
payments due Jan. 29 on short-term swaps drawn from the U.S. Treasury and
the Fed.
        "People might think it is for the IMF or the U.S. Treasury, but the
money does not have a specific purpose," insists Daniel Martinez, advisor
to Martin Werner, Mexico's director general of public credit."The money is
just being used to refinance short-term debt and improve the debt profile."
        Market sources, however, disagreed and seemed amused with Mexico's
curious response.
        "They have some money to pay back to the U.S. Who are they
kidding," wonders a syndicator.
        Chemical Bank analysts suggest that Mexico will almost surely repay
the half due to the Fed, for legal reasons, but that payment on the
Treasury's half is less certain. There's been "some hint" that the Mexican
government has been seeking to roll over the debt, says the research group
in a Jan. 8 analysis. But, "given the politically charged environment in
the U.S., we believe this will be a hard sell," Chemical says.
        Martinez  refused say when Mexico would issue next. Perhaps the
country will follow Argentina to Japan--Mexico has certainly mimicked
Argentina before. The Argentine government is said to be leaning towards a
yen deal, maybe as soon as this week (see page 8).
        Deutchemark deal fever shows no sign of abating--the likely drop in
German interest rates should stoke even more issuance. Mexico was the
second Latin American country to lengthen a DM tenor to seven years. Co-led
by CS First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the issue carried a 10.38%
coupon, 1/8% higher than the 10.25% coupon that Argentina's seven-year deal
carried two weeks ago.
        A syndicate source says the Mexican issue's higher coupon makes it
slightly more attractive than the Argentine seven-year bond, and has sold
briskly with German and Swiss retail investors. Mexico last tapped the DM
market in October with a five-year DM 1 billion deal for 9.38%.--Dan B.

DEBT RESTRUCTURING TICKING ALONG

With the holidays over, the commercial debt restructuring deals of
Peru, Panama and Slovenia are seeing renewed progress toward completion.
There have been no reports of significant snags or delays in any of the
deals; the original timetables seem to be substantially on track.
        As it promised, Panama has refrained from asking for a rebalancing
of options choices in its $3.5 billion Brady, even though the choices were
far from the balanced breakdown the country the country had sought. With
nearly all the debt spoken for--and no indication of any major renegades
among creditors--the overwhelming majority of orders came in for interest
reduction bonds, covering 81.9% of the debt by Panama's count. Pars bonds
were chosen for only 13.6% of the debt, and discounts only 4.5%. Nary a
creditor chose new money.
        "There is nothing at this point that would hold the deal back,"
said a banking source. Panama is still reviewing the final documentation.
No signing debt has been set, but the two sides are still hoping for
signing in this quarter, and a closing in the next.
        The aggressive timetable for Peru's $9 billion Brady has slipped a
little. Bank creditors handed their version of the term sheet to Peru in
early December, right on time, but it hasn't yet come back. The Peruvians
say they want a first quarter closing, but it looks now like both sides
would have to work like lightning to accomplish that. There has been no
further movement on specifying more closely the debt's participation in
debt for equity swaps; apparently the term sheet will say only that the
Brady debt can't be excluded from any such scheme the country puts forth.
        Slovenia's bank advisory committee was last week awaiting waivers
from creditors that would free Slovenia's share of the ex-Yugoslavia's debt
and allow Slovenia to begin paying off about $800 million in obligations at
Libor + 13/16. Creditors holding at least two-thirds of the debt must
approve the country's exit from the joint and several liability for ex-Yugo
debt. Bankers have not expected a problem, but the New York blizzard and
the fact that some French banks reportedly didn't get the documents until
last Tuesday could create some slight delays. Slovenia hopes to close the
deal within 70 days from waiver approval. -- MD

THINK TANK CHIEF FORESEES CUBAN BLOODSHED

Despite some Cuban economic modernization and a tentative opening
toward non-U.S. foreign investment, Cuba and the United States are unlikely
to move toward eliminating the long-standing U.S. economic embargo against
Cuba in the near future, predicts Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on
Foreign Relations.
        In fact, Gelb foresees something much darker: the possibility of a
bloody civil war "as awful as Bosnia" in the coming years, with the
transition away from a Castro regime.
        Cuba "could be on the edge, in three years, or 10 years, of real
civil war," Gelb suggested last week during a talk at the Americas Society
in New York, shortly after returning from a week of talks in Cuba that the
Council on Foreign Relations arranged with the Cuban government.
        Gelb, a former Pulitzer-prizewinning New York Times journalist and
U.S. diplomat, participated in a series of meetings with top Cuban
political and economic officials during his November visit, which included
five hours of talks with Castro.
        His conclusions are bad news for investors who hope for
regularization of Cuba's defaulted $4 billion debt to Western banks. While
offshore and other non U.S.-registered funds have taken small positions in
defaulted Cuban loans (the Emerging Markets Traders Association recorded
nearly $1.2 billion face value in trades of Cuban instruments last year,
$652 million of that in loan trades that averaged less than $2 million
each), and there are several funds collecting money in wait for better
portfolio investment opportunities on the island, the main impetus for
appreciation of such investments would be the lifting or softening of the
35-year-old embargo.
        Liquidity would improve dramatically, as U.S. investors now banned
from holding the debt would be allowed to participate. War, of course,
could wipe out such positions altogether. Cuban debt now trades in the low
to mid 20s.
        Cuba has a team of well-trained economic managers, which Gelb
equates with the teams Mexico has sported in the last dozen years. However,
their initiatives would presumably be overshadowed by the thrust U.S. -
Cuban diplomatic relations.
Both Sides Take Hard Line
        Pressured by anti-Castro Cubans in the United States, President
Clinton is highly unlikely to soften the U.S. stance toward Cuba in the
runup to the Nov. 1996 U.S. presidential elections, Gelb points out. But,
for reasons of its own, the Castro administration isn't particularly eager
to see sanctions lifted now, either.
        Despite a 40% plunge of the Cuban economy after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and a desperate need for U.S. investment, Castro seems to
fear that the end of the embargo also might mean an end to his regime.
Cubans could become further disillusioned with their president if they
conclude that domestic problems typically blamed on the embargo persist
after it is lifted.
        "My sense is that Fidel Castro is not interested in the next year
or two in making any significant concession to the United States," Gelb
says.
        Gelb advocates gradually lifting the embargo, to avoid shocking the
Cuban economy, and calls for increased diplomacy via U.S.-Cuban military
contacts and a strengthening of the trend to encourage U.S. NGOs to operate
in Cuba.
        But he doesn't think the present situation can last too long,
partly because of the great pressure of an alluring American society 90
miles away.
        "I don't think the situation is long-term stable," Gelb says. Cuba
has begun to grow again, but the 2.5% growth expected this year--perhaps 4%
later on if the sugar harvest is good--is far too slow to be meaningful
after a tumble that was far worse than the United States suffered during
the Great Depression.
        "I just don't think the Cuban situation will continue to evolve
peacefully," he says. He reports that Cuban officials are "very concerned"
about how to create a transition from the rule of Castro, who doesn't want
to leave. Under one scenario, the Cuban military could end up disbanding,
Miami Cubans could return en masse, and the island could find itself thrust
into a civil war.

NY FED'S E-MARKETS CHIEF: IT'S NOT A CRACKDOWN

The New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be strongly
focused on information gathering and policy recommendation--and wasn't
created to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,
the chief of the effort stresses.
        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smack
people in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named to
the new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.
        Checki, 50, becomes the New York Fed's eighth executive vp. The job
is intended to consolidate various pieces of emerging markets research and
supervision that had been scattered across different departments, he says.
His top priority, he adds, is to be sure Fed policymakers know what's going
on.
        While it seems logical to take such a step after the solution to
Mexico's Dec. 1994 peso crisis landed squarely and expensively on the U.S.
government's doorstep, and the Daiwa Bank trading loss debacle appeared to
catch the New York Fed failing to act on information it had for years, Fed
officials said creation of the group was neither expressly the result of
these issues, nor a signal of stepped-up or changing regulatory practices.
"We're not doing anything now that we haven't done before," Checki said.
        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge of
international banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDC
expert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDC
debt crisis in the 1980s, functioning as ex-NY Fed chief Gerald Corrigan's
top international troubleshooter and then taking on the same role for
current NY Fed chief William McDonough.
         But Checki doesn't see his role as limited to U.S. commercial or
foreign bank supervision. Instead, he expects to maintain information ties
with all of the players and influences driving emerging markets--keeping
informed about the initiatives of investment banks and funds, tracking
political, economic and financial trends, and consulting with other central
banks.
         His priority is to get emerging markets information to McDonough,
preferably "before it emerges," and make policy recommendations, he says.
        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure better
economic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing the
majority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in the
wake of the Mexican crisis.
         "I think we need to see that the information is as available as
possible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that the
IMF "should not be in the business of assembling information for the
private sector," he does think the Fund has an important role to play in
making sure good financial information is procured from borrowing
countries.
        His advice to those thinking of participating in emerging markets
for the first time: "Tell them to be sure of their ability to swim," he
says, "and to understand how deep the water is."--Mary D'Ambrosio

TELEBRAS RATED TO SOVEREIGN CEILING

Moody's has assigned an initial B1 rating to Brazil's
Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras). About $720 million worth of debt
securities are affected. The rating is constrained by the Republic's B1
sovereign ceiling.
        The agency says Telebras needs to raise significant funds, reduce
overhead and adjust its rates as it loses its virtual reign as the monopoly
provider of Brazil's telecommunications service.
        Moody's believes, however, that the Brazilian government will
establish a new regulatory and pricing framework to adjust Telebras's rate
structure so the rates become closer to the costs of providing services,
enabling Telebras to compete more effectively in the new environment.
Chilgener Rated Baa1
        Moody's has assigned a Baa1 to Chilgener of Chile, at the sovereign
ceiling. The rating will apply to the company's $150 million Yankee.

CALDERA MAY FACE VIOLENCE; CHINA TIED TO DENG'S FATE

Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera faces the increased threat of
political violence and a military coup if he accepts IMF conditions, and
the country may emerge with a center-left government in the 1998 elections.
China's business climate is threatened by a weak central government and
political uncertainty as Deng Xiaoping's death nears. In Ecuador, a
sluggish economy and a divided congress mean May 1996 elections are
unlikely to usher in economic improvements.
        Those are some of the conclusions that the Syracuse, New York
analytical firm Political Risk Services presents in its January forecast.
        Romanian President Ion Iliescu's supporters are unlikely to win a
majority in September's Parliament elections. But both Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori are seen as secure in
their positions.
        Venezuela's considerable problems remain due to an overdependence
on oil exports and a lack of fiscal discipline, in the opinion of these
analysts, in a climate of high inflation and no growth. Inflation is
projected to climb to 75% in 1996, from 46.9% last year. Caldera's populist
stance is not making the country's situation easier either, and leftist
Causa R may benefit in the 1998 elections. Causa R's presidential candidate
Andres Velasquez finished second to Caldera in 1993.
        In China, despite some forms of private enterprise, there is much
concern over the business climate. Some government groups are discussing
the removal of foreign tax breaks. Another potential problem is the growing
aggressiveness of the Chinese military in the South China Sea. Pressure
from the U.S. over the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, trade policy and
human rights could also threaten foreign businesses, analysts say.
        In Ecuador, prospects are slim that President Sixto  Ballen's
administration can implement necessary economic reforms to stimulate the
economy. GDP growth is expected to fall to 1.8% in 1996 after reaching 3.6%
this year.
        The economy is also at risk because of increased violence and the
threat of a military coup. But the May 1996 elections are unlikely to
result in a regime any more capable of improving the economy.
        Romania's Iliescu is favored to win September's presidential
elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a parliamentary majority.
Despite opposition, Iliescu remains popular as he moves the economy towards
integration with the EU.
        Budget cuts and market reforms are being implemented to qualify for
assistance from the IMF and the EU, but not enough to greatly improve the
business climate. But, inflation is projected to fall dramatically to 28%
in 1996 from 161.5% last year and GDP growth is expected to rise to 4% this
year from 3.6% shrinkage in 1995.
        In Egypt, Mubarek's willingness to use force, mixed with political
liberalization, has kept the opposition off balance and solidified his
control in Egypt. Some progress has been made in reducing foreign debt,
controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth,but essential
privatizations have yet to occur.
        Peru's Fujimori also shows no signs of losing control, standing
high in public opinion polls. Peru's economy is healthy by South American
standards, and Fujimori presided over the country's debt-restructuring
deal. A question for the long term is finding a presidential successor.

LEGAL NOTES

Legal Notes is prepared by James Leavy and M. Cecilia Gaviria of Serra
Michaud & Associes, Paris based on information produced by law firms from
Latin America. This is part one of their monthly report. Part two will
appear next week.
Brazil
Measures to strengthen the financial system
The government and the Central Bank have adopted a series of measures to
support the financial system, parts of which have come under strain as
Brazil moves to a low-inflation monetary system.
a) PROER
A package of measures concerns a special program created by the Central
Bank and known as PROER (Program for Encouraging the Restructuring and
Strengthening of the National Financial System).
Created by Resolution 2208 of the Central Bank, PROER consists of the
following major elements:
i) a special line of financial assistance linked to securities or other
operations of the National Treasury or Federal Government entities, to
losses arising in the process of reorganization of financial institutions,
to the costs of restructuring and modernizing operational systems and to
mobilization of assets of the participating institutions. (Circular 2636 of
the Central Bank sets out the principal conditions applicable to operations
using this financial line);
ii) availability of resources arising from compulsory deposits or
contributions, linked to acquisition of bank CDs issued by entities
participating in PROER;
iii) greater flexibility in reaching operational limits required of
financial institutions;
iv) deferment of costs related to restructuring and modernizing of
financial institutions.
In connection with this program the Government adopted a provisional
measure providing for several tax concessions to entities taking part in
PROER, including the following:
a) where an entity is incorporated to take over a failing institution, it
may treat the institution's difficult loans as losses ("difficult loans"
are defined in Resolution  2210 of the Central Bank);
b) the incorporating entities may treat as a financial cost, the difference
between the purchase price of their investment and the book value of their
interest in the acquired entity;
c) for tax purposes, the losses described in a) and amortized costs
described in b) (up to a limit each year together with tax losses carried
forward from previous years, of 30% of gross profits) can be offset against
gross profits.
Central Bank Circular 2633 specifies that access to the PROER program will
be decided on by the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis and is limited to
recognized financial institutions which acquire the control of another such
institution or whose control passes to such institution or which assume the
rights and/or obligations of such an institution. The Circular specifies
that admission to PROER does not diminish any criminal or other liability
which the directors of an entity taken over might otherwise have.
b) Other Measures
Provisional Measure 1.182 applies the rules of existing legislation on
quarantine of property ("indisponibilidade de bens") to that of the persons
controlling a financial institution which is the subject of intervention,
liquidation or temporary special administration. It authorizes the Central
Bank to take special measures such as injecting additional capital,
transferring control or corporate restructuring for the purpose of
safeguarding the public interest (including the interests of depositors)
where a financial institution is in serious difficulty. It sets out the
types of measures which can be taken with the prior authorization of the
Central Bank when a financial institution is subject to intervention,
liquidation, as well as the measures which can be taken in respect of the
directors of the affected institution.
Resolution 2.212 of the Central Bank strengthens the capital adequacy and
prudential requirements of financial institutions, particularly in the
context of a change in the control of such institutions.
Resolution 2.211 of the Central Bank approves the by-laws and regulations
of the Credit Guarantee Fund, which is designed to guarantee deposits and
other credits against financial institutions in case of bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar situations. Financial institutions contribute monthly
to the Fund an amount equal to 0.025% of the balance of accounts guaranteed
by the Fund.

Colombia
Privatization legislation
Following a decision of the Constitutional Court, Congress has adopted
legislation to regulate article 60 of the national constitution and thus
provide a general legal framework for privatizations. The new legislation
provides that privatizations must be carried out in accordance with a
program approved the Finance Ministry and the relevant Ministry to which
the respective entity is attached, which program must be notified to
Congress.
Each privatization must be carried out in a context which permits wide
dispersion of share ownership, protection of public resources and (where
applicable) continuity of the public service which is provided by the
privatized entity.
Current and former employees of the entity would be given preferred status
in the allocation of shares, as would, labor unions, employee pension
funds, investment funds and similar entities.
Shares in the relevant entity must be offered at a price which reflects the
valuation carried out under the authority of the relevant ministry. Offers
can only be made when arrangements have been put in place to enable those
having preferred allocation rights to exercise those rights, including
special lines of credit (minimum term 5 years: security interest on shares
being purchased). Those receiving preferred share allocations may be
required to retain their shares for up to 2 years and limits may be placed
on the amount of shares allocated to senior management of the entity
immediately prior to privatization.
The new legislation specifies that privatizations of financial institutions
are subject to the special legislation governing the financial sector and
that no privatizations of certain entities in which the State telecom
company has an interest may be carried out before Jan. 1, 1998.
(Source: Vincent Trevisani, Cavelier Abogados, Santafe de Bogot )
Mexico
Adjustments to financial institutions legislation
A recent congressional decree has made some adjustments to the legislation
governing banks, securities markets, insurance and guarantee companies and
specialized financial institutions. Among the changes are the following:
i) provision is made so that the shares held by foreign financial
institutions or insurers in their Mexican subsidiaries are clearly
identified. At least 51% of the shares in the subsidiary must be held in a
special category reserved to the foreign controlling entity (or its holding
subsidiary). Those shares can only be disposed of with the prior
authorization of the Finance Ministry;
ii) the limits on individual holdings of shares in insurance or guarantee
companies can be exceeded where such a company is being converted into a
local subsidiary of a foreign entity;
iii) financial institutions must establish systems for dealing with clients
inquiries and complaints and a system of arbitration is provided for before
the National Banking and Securities Commission where a dispute persists
between a financial institution and its client;
iv) special provision is made for recovery of claims owed to the national
government and generally for carrying out treasury activities in respect of
assets held by or belonging to the national government, including funds and
securities.

SOVEREIGN FUND SEES VALUE IN VENEZUELA AND BULGARIA

Diego Aramburu, manager of Atlantic Security Bank's Atlantic Sovereign
Fund, thinks Venezuelan and Bulgarian bonds will help him build on the
23.06% gain the $26 million fund achieved last year.
        The Cayman Island-registered fund, held by the offshore securities
arm of Banco Credito de Peru, performed slightly behind the J.P. Morgan
Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus, which returned 26.78% in 1995. But
Micropal ranked the fund third out of 23 Latin American regional debt funds
through last November.
         The fund is 100% emerging markets debt, and Aramburu, who invests
mostly in Bradys and some sovereign Eurobonds for yield and liquidity,
touts bonds of Venezuela and Bulgaria as values this year.
        "We understand the risks in Venezuela. We think there are
fundamental changes in the policy that will make Venezuela attractive,"
says Aramburu, who works out of Lima and Miami. Though he is critical of
President Rafael Caldera's populist stance, he supports the government's
recent devaluation and thinks an IMF deal is coming soon.  He is also
counting on banking, social and tax reforms to cut the fiscal deficit.
Gasoline price hikes are also likely as part of an IMF deal, but the fund
manager differs from many analysts in believing that social unrest will not
result. "The population is understanding better that some measures need to
be taken. They are going in the right direction," says Aramburu.  But he
predicts that Caldera won't be reelected in 1998.
        Aramburu recently bought options on Venezuelan DCBs, bringing the
portfolio's Venezuelan holdings to 5%. "The fact is the market gave us
relative value with those," he says.
        Aramburu also argues that Bulgarian Bradys, which make up 10% of
the fund, are undervalued compared with Poland's. "There is not a big
difference between those countries," he insists. "Bulgaria's financial
numbers are not the best, but they are improving." Aramburu thinks
Bulgarian IABs, yielding around 14%, are one of the most undervalued
instruments available today.
        The remainder of the fund's portfolio includes a heavy 10% position
in Peru, a standard 25% stake in Brazil, 15% holdings in each Argentina and
Mexico, 7% holdings in Nigeria and small positions in other Latin
countries, such as Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.
        The fund started in Oct. 1994 when the company merged the bank's
Latin and Growth funds. Aramburu had established the Latin Fund in 1990,
shortly after joining the bank, and set up the Growth Fund two years later.
But, "both funds had similar objectives so it didn't make sense to have the
two separate," he says.
         Fund products cannot be sold in the U.S. The Sovereign Fund pays
dividends twice a year equal to six-month Libor + 1% of the value of the
purchase price of the fund's shares. Latin American private investors are
the typical clients,  and they purchase shares with a minimum investment of
$50,000.
        Aramburu, 34, is a total return investor who uses bottom-up
fundamental analysis when making investment decisions. He also follows
political situations closely, but acknowledges his worst mistakes have been
those made primarily based on news from various newspapers around the
globe.
        "The political part of analysis is very difficult to quantify, and
we are very much interested in quantification," says Aramburu, who holds a
Ph.D. in international economics from the University of Miami. Aramburu
follows a model that establishes a relationship between the values of
assets against a country's fundamentals.
        Aramburu generally holds assets for at least three months, but
trades part of the portfolio heavily once a month to find high yields. The
fund is now fully invested, compared to the 40% cash it held at the
beginning of 1995.
         Aramburu maintains a 25% stake in Brazilian holdings because he
finds excellent values among DCBs, Exits and EI's.
        Argentine FRBs and discounts make up the bulk of the 15% Argentina
position. Aramburu says Argentina is being unfairly correlated with pre-
peso devaluation Mexico; he thinks the country's stronger export sector and
reserve position leave it in superior shape. Aramburu expects Mexico to
struggle mightily during the first half as fourth quarter 1995 numbers are
released, but foresees improvements later in 1996.              One country
he won't invest in is Russia, despite the $32 billion debt rescheduling
agreement. "The problem with Russia is the lack of financial numbers," he
says. "It's like investing in a company that you don't have the financials
for. I still don't have a grasp on what Russia's numbers are. --Dan B.

BRAZIL BUYBACK TALK STOKES LDCS

The LDC debt market gained for the second straight week, despite
concerns over the U.S. budget negotiations, rising about one point on the
week to Thursday. Brazil led a spirited rally last Thursday on strong
rumors that it will soon conduct a two-step buyback worth $300 million of
debt owed to it by Paraguay. Brazilian locals were active in the buying as
well as a U.S. insurance company, which purchased $150 million worth of
Brazilian C-bonds, pars and EI's, according to a New York trader. C-bonds
gained two points to 61 3/8 bid, 61 5/8 offered, while IDU's were up almost
a point to 87 1/8 bid, 87 1/2 offered.
        The market traded up early last week, before halting last Tuesday
when the U.S. budget negotiations bogged down again. But the market rallied
later in the week and stopped following the long bond down. The long bond
then rallied last Thursday afternoon following President Clinton's news
conference to yield 6.15%. "The emerging markets are short of treading
water watching the U.S. budget discussions, but the underlying bid is still
strong," says the trader, noting how new money continues entering the
market.
        Mexican issues were mixed. Discounts gained almost one point to 74
bid, 74 1/4 offered, while pars lost 1/2 to 66 1/8 bid, 66 3/4 offered.
        Argentine issues were flat. FRBs were unchanged at 72 3/8 bid, 72
5/8 offered, while pars lost about 1/2 a point to 56 3/8 bid, 56 5/8
offered. Venezuelan issues held firm as the market watches the country
resume discussions with the IMF this week. Pars were flat at 58 1/8 bid, 58
3/8 offered, as were DCBs at 57 1/4 bid, 57 1/2 offered.
        Exotics, big gainers two weeks ago, were flat last week. Nigeria
par bonds fell one point to 51 bid, 51 1/2 offered, while Morocco tranche A
was off half a point to 67 3/8 bid, 67 3/4 offered. Vneshekonombank dollar
loans lost almost 3/4 of a point to 34 3/8 bid, 34 7/8 offered.

NEW ISSUES


U.S. Investors Inhale ELM
     Timing was everything for Mexican cigarette company Empresas La
Modern, which increased its Euro with a 144A option to $125 million last
week. ELM's three-year deal, joint led by ING and J.P. Morgan, was
oversubscribed two to one and enlarged from $100 million. ELM was to launch
the deal last November but backed out due to a difficult market
environment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,
carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia and
Europe.
        "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds,"
says Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It was
relatively attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and is
well priced and valued."
        Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELM
issue last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was lured back by the
changing sentiment towards Mexico.
Nafinsa Gets Aggressive
        Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro via
Salomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive and
aggressive. The three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 bp
over U.S. Treasuries. The deal, which carries a 144A option, was popular
with European retail investors, but some in the U.S. were not impressed.
        "I think it's expensive for the investor. You can get Nafinsa paper
with the same spread for shorter maturities," says one.
Argentina Weighs Yen
        Argentina, fresh off of a DM 500 million ($347.8 million) deal two
weeks ago, is receiving bids for another issue, and may launch a
substantial yen deal this week, according to a yen source. "They've
received a number of different structures, but a yen deal looks good," the
source says. Argentina may launch either a five-year, 50 billion ($476.8
million) deal with a 6% coupon or a three-year, 30 billion yen ($286
million) issue with a 4.5% coupon, the source says. Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko
are in the running.
        But Argentina may instead issue in Italian lira again to get a
bigger deal, according to the source. Argentina issued a 150 billion lira
($93.1 million) Euro last September and may want to continue diversifying
again.
Colombia Dusts Off Yankee
        Colombia's 20-year Yankee issue lead-managed by Merrill Lynch and
Goldman Sachs is expected to launch in the next three weeks, according to
market sources. Yield-hungry investors are said to have made the deal,
shelved last November, possible again. The issue may contain two tranches--
seven- and 20-years. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Goldman Sachs officials
would comment.
Chilgener Takes $150M Deal To Road
        Roadshows for Chilgener's $150 million Yankee begin today in New
York (weather permitting) and end in California later in the week. Lead
manager Smith Barney, and co-managers Chase Manhattan and ING Baring are
marketing the 10-year notes for Chile's second largest electric generator
to high grade funds, but few emerging market accounts, according to a
syndicate source. Price talk is not available, but a source says it will be
similar to the 7% that Celulosa Arauco's $300 million Yankee carried last
December. "Chilgener is a better credit than Celulosa Arauco. It is better
rated and is a utility while Celulosa is in the forestry industry," the
syndicate source says.
Brazilian Samurai Mandate Expected
        Brazil is expected to award a mandate for a Samurai bond worth 30
billion yen ($286 million). Nomura has been rumored to be named lead, but
yen sources say it may not be a done deal. "Nomura has been backing off,"
says one. "I think they believe their relationship with Brazil will be
enough to get them the deal." The issue is expected to be for five years
with a coupon of between 6% and 6.25% and may launch at the end of
February.
BBA Leads Brazilian Banks
        Banco BBA Creditanstalt is expected to launch a DM 100 million
($69.5 million) issue for three years this week via Banque Paribas. The
deal is expected to carry an 8.63% coupon for a yield of 470 bp over the
bund.
        Other Brazilian banks, including Banco Safra and Banco Bamerindus,
are expected to launch deals before the month is out. Safra is planning a
Eurobond, while Bamerindus is planning a Deutschemark issue via CS First
Boston, market sources say.
Telebras Set To Dial Italy
        Telecommunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras) is expected to launch a
300 billion lira ($189.9 million) deal via J.P. Morgan this week. The
issue, expected to carry a coupon of between 13.25% and 13.50%, may be
increased to 400 billion lira ($253.2 million) due to positive responses by
potential investors, market sources say.
Japanese Brave Refah Threat
        Despite the possibility of a Muslim-led government in Turkey, some
Japanese investors have a strong thirst for Turkish paper. Turkey launched
a 10 billion yen ($95.4 million) deal via Yamaichi last week. The 10-year
notes sold at par with a 7.2% coupon and were purchased by Japanese
institutional investors and financial institutions. "This issue was driven
by a specific demand by a series of investors," says a Yamaichi source.
Turkey raised $493 million last December with a three-year 50 billion yen
deal led by Nomura Securities. Turkish officials are now contemplating
issuing more bonds in other currencies.--Dan B. Levine

CLARIFICATION

A story about the emerging market business on Dec. 18 left out
phrases in several statements by Bank of Boston Managing Director Ignacio
Sosa.
        Sosa said that "Whatever we did previously in emerging markets
sales and trading has absolutely no relationship to where we are going. He
added that the bank's focus "on the new issue side will be on corporates,
that is one difference in relation to our competitors who focus on
sovereigns."
        We regret the omissions.

IFC GETTING OUT OF BANKERS' YARD

WASHINGTON
Commercial banks are applauding the new guidelines
adopted by the International Finance Corp. designed to keep the World
Bank's private finance arm out of areas that could be handled by the
private sector. However, in a report by the Institute for International
Finance reviewing
the IFC changes, the banks cautioned that there are areas where the IFC
needs to be more clear about its efforts to avoid displacing private banks.
        The banks expressed concern about the IFC continuing to participate
in financing in countries that would have no trouble attracting private
sources, and should have been graduated from the IFC program by now, among
them Chile, Colombia, Turkey and Thailand.
        The IFC has left this "graduation" up to private banks, and has not
set a clear criteria for staff to judge whether a company or country should
be treated as off limits. Often companies that have a long-standing
relationship with the IFC are inclined to return there in the future, even
when they could find private capital sources.
        In these cases, the IFC should only become involved in exceptional
circumstances, and limit participation to countries that could not
otherwise find financing, the report stated, although it added the proviso
that a country's graduation should be reversible, so that the IFC could re-
enter if needed.
        "In Latin America and Asia the private sector is capable of doing
the job, if not single-handedly, than at least predominantly," while there
is much more need for the IFC in Africa, said Donald McCouch, group
executive of Chemical Bank, who participated in preparing the report.
However, McCouch said the IFC should be given credit for trying to adapt to
a changing world.
        The IIF report, which focuses on nine areas of the new IFC
guidelines, in general was in favor of the changes. "We believe the IFC is
taking important steps towards increasing its effectiveness and increasing
its ability to catalyze private finance for developing countries," said
Charles Dallara, managing director of the IIF.
        "It will help focus the efforts on places where it is most needed,
and greatly reduces if not eliminates the displacement of private sector,"
Dallara told reporters, adding that scarce IFC resources should not be used
on a project that could be financed wholly with private funds.
        The report also recommended the IFC limit its activities in
securities underwriting and equity participation to exceptional cases where
it is clear the transaction would not be completed without IFC
participation.
        The value of IFC participation in underwriting international issues
has been limited, since it has worked with well-known companies in
developing countries that could have been underwritten by private
investment banks. However, IFC has scaled back its operations in this area.
        There also were concerns about a conflict of interest when the IFC
acts as a lender, particularly in a B-loan syndication, in a company in
which it has equity interest.
        The report praised the IFC for deciding to refrain from competing
in bidding for privatization advisory mandates, but said the IFC should
continue to scale back its advisory operations, and stay out of any bidding
for such programs. It should concentrate on establishing regulatory
environments necessary for privatization, model privatization transactions
in countries like Russia and the Ukraine, and focus on those where there is
negligible private sector interest, such as Haiti.
        Bankers stressed that in no instance should the IFC link financial
support to obtaining the advisory mandates, which Dallara said he has seen
happen many times in the past.
        The report also recommended the IFC increase its use of guarantees
to leverage private financing, continue its efforts to diversity sources of
co-financing for B-loan syndications, use private sources more for
appraising, arranging and managing project financing, and put in place an
appeals procedure for institutions concerned about displacement.

PEOPLE

The next two weeks will be nervewracking for Chemical Bank and
Chase Manhattan emerging markets division employees,  as Chemical/Chase co-
emerging markets heads Daniel Canel and Jorge V. Jasson are expected to
eliminate some duplicate jobs. "The additional cuts are probably going to
come at the end of the month," says a Chase insider.
        Canel and Jasson named 13 top managers last month for the new
capital markets division: seven from Chase and six from Chemical. Chase
head Brady trader George P. Grunebaum and Chemical managing director Raul
Ponte become head traders in the U.S., while Barry J. Hoffner and Brian C.
Lazell, each of Chemical, hold the same positions in London. Chase research
head Lawrence J. Brainard maintains the same position in the consolidated
group, with Chemical research chief Thomas J. Trebat as deputy. Chase head
of syndication Cynthia Powell also keeps her spot, Chase's Federico L.
Amadeo is responsible for Latin America origination and Chemical's Gabriel
G. Politzer will cover Latin America local markets and external debt.
        Also, Chase's John P. Colligan has been tapped to handle U.S.
sales, while Chase's Gustavo M. Dominguez is responsible for derivatives,
structured products and arbitrage. Rounding out the appointments are
Chemical's Anette L. Kolenda, named business manager, and Chase's Rachelle
C. Keller, who was selected as Kolenda's deputy.
        Noticeably absent from the list is Chemical syndication head Juan
Lacroze, who helped engineer Mexico's $1.5 billion Eurobond last December.
Lacroze is remaining with the new Chase--just not in the syndication
department. But his new role has not been announced.
