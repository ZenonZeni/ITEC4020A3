<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
About 680 acres at Fort Benning Military Reservation, Georgia, were prepared as a parachute drop-zone in 1988.  Trees were cut down, stumps grubbed, and gullies filled, destroying existing plant cover.  This resulted in a barren, infertile landscape that became severely eroded.  Sediment was carried into adjacent forest, and the accumulation of sediment damaged and killed some of the den trees of the red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species that requires living trees for nesting.

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne's CERS was asked to develop an erosion control and revegetation plan for stabilizing the drop-zone.  CERS staff conducted site surveys to collect data on the amount and types of existing plant cover and the type and degree of soil erosion.  Soils samples were collected and analyzed to determine soil characteristics.   A global positioning system was used to map the locations of roads, existing dam checks, and other physical features.  This information was combined with topographic and other data, using a geographical information system, to provide detailed site maps.  Information was gathered on local climatic conditions, candidate revegetation species, and designs for erosion control structures.
<P>
Test plots were established to evaluate potential revegetation species and determine plant response to soil amendments.  These data were then used to develop detailed erosion control and revegetation plans and specifications.
<P>
Detailed cost data on materials, labor, and equipment used were collected during each rehabilitation operation.  Following revegetation efforts, changes in vegetation cover were monitored.  Field observations were made to determine the effectiveness of erosion control structures.  Cost information was combined with monitoring data and field observations to determine the cost-effectiveness of each rehabilitation operation.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
Four erosion control and rehabilitation contracts have been implemented by local contractors at the drop-zone.  Revegetation efforts involved liming, fertilizing, and seeding with mixtures of adapted grasses and legumes to increase vegetative cover and reduce runoff rates.  Of the 680 acres in the drop-zone, approximately 365 have been limed, fertilized, and seeded; another 62 acres have been fertilized to increase vegetative cover and reduce soil erosion rates.  Over 1,000 feet of silt fence was constructed to curtail sediment deposition in adjacent forest areas.  The 1,400 feet of terrace and the 325 feet of riprap-lined waterway have helped to control erosion of the steep slope next to the airstrip.  Six porous check dams were constructed in gullies to limit gully erosion, and outlets on six existing check dams have been modified to reduce runoff velocity and trap sediment.

<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Cost, effectiveness, and site condition data will be used to refine future erosion control and revegetation plans for other disturbed sites with similar conditions.
