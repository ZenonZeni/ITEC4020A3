DEPRECIATION PROPOSALS ALARM UK COMPANIES

UK STANDARD setters will face concerted opposition from the brewing and
hotel industries to proposed accounting changes which could slash 10
percent or more from the pre-tax profits of both sectors.

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) wants to impose a general
requirement for companies to depreciate the value of their properties.
Current rules enable them to avoid this on the grounds that the
properties are either increasing in value or being regularly maintained
or refurbished.

Shares in the brewing industry fell recently in anticipation of the
change, even though it would have no impact on a company's cash flow.

The proposals are contained in a new ASB discussion paper on
measurement of tangible assets, which the board expects to lead to a
new accounting standard. The paper argues that it is normally
"uneconomic" to provide a limitless extension to the life of a property
through maintenance or refurbishment.

The board also wants all companies to have their properties
independently revalued every five years. About 60 percent of companies
revalue operating properties. These values should also be kept up to
date, the board says.

"Under the present arrangements, companies that revalued their
properties in the late-1980s at the height of the property boom have
since been able to leave these valuations in their accounts unchanged,"
pointed out ASB chairman David Tweedie. One exception to the new rules
would be so-called "trophy" properties, assets of historical
significance which have an unlimited useful economic life and need not
be depreciated. This category might include stores such as Harrods,
prime site city hotels or 16th century coaching inns.

The possible impact of the proposals is shown in the table, supplied by
analysts UBS Global Research. Scenario 1 is conservative, assuming 25
percent residual asset value (being freehold land and remaining bricks
and mortar) and a 50-year depreciation charge. Scenario 2 is more
optimistic at 33 percent residual value, 100-year depreciation on
freeholds and 50 years on long leaseholds.

The board has recommended that investment properties should continue to
be excluded from depreciation (assumed in the table). UBS points out
that this will be particularly welcomed at certain companies such as
P&O and GUS, where investment properties form by far the greatest
proportion of their portfolio. However, the analysts also stress that
this exemption may eventually be lost under EU accounting plans.

Another bright spot for the companies, says UBS, is the paper's
apparent suggestion that an element of repairs and maintenance spend
may be capitalised and depreciated along with the asset.

The majority of this spend is currently written off immediately to P&L,
UBS points out. Therefore earnings benefits could come via deferral of
a part of the expense, potentially offsetting any additional
depreciation hit.

The proposals have been put out to consultation and a draft standard is
likely some time next year. According to an ASB spokesman, a final
standard is unlikely before 1998"at the earliest".

SHARE ACCOUNTING CRACKDOWN

NEW PROPOSALS aimed at tightening up accounting for employee share
ownership schemes have been published in the UK. The Accounting
Standards Board's Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) wants to see the real
value of shares - not merely their nominal amount - charged to the
profit and loss account.

The new proposals would apply to Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) as
well as more long-standing types of scheme. LTIPs, a new type of
executive share scheme which links rewards to performance, have become
popular since the Greenbury Committee on executive pay recommended they
should replace existing executive schemes last year.

Companies' use of LTIPs is an ongoing source of controversy. A recent
study by corporate governance analysts Pension Investment Research
Consultants found a host of top UK plcs were breaching good practice
guidelines on their use (see TA 5913).

Under the new proposals, adjustments would be made to the profit and
loss account charge to take account of such factors as: changes in the
probability of performance criteria being met; conditional awards
lapsing; or purchases of shares at different prices (either to hedge
the cost of conditional awards or meet the cost of final awards).

In cases where options are granted at a discount (ie the exercise price
is below the market value of the shares at the date of grant), the UITF
said, the discount should be recognised as an expense over the
appropriate period. One example is SAYE schemes, where the exercise
price is normally at a 20 percent discount.

Executive share options schemes are unlikely to be affected by the
proposals, as Greenbury recommended that executive share options should
never be issued at a discount.

The proposals have been sent to finance directors of listed companies
for comments.

A deadline of November 7 was set for responses.

SCOTS SEEK GUIDANCE ON PRELIMS

THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) has called
for new guidance on compiling preliminary results announcements, after
a survey found that companies currently publish a wide variety of
information. ICAS also wants the figures to be audited.

The institute analysed the prelims of 20 top 500 companies and compared
them with the information contained in the annual report. To its
surprise, the study revealed not all companies included a profit and
loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement in prelims as a
matter of course.

Every company published a P&L but one omitted a balance sheet and four
failed to include a cash flow statement. Inclusion of the statement of
total recognised gains and losses (8), the reconciliation of movements
in shareholders funds (9), and the historical cost profit and loss
statement were found to be still more variable.

Analysis of narrative content showed that all but one company in each
case included a chairman's statement and financial highlights. But only
11 and 10 respectively published a financial review or chief
executive's statement.

ICAS has called on the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) to develop a
non-mandatory statement of best practice to improve consistency.

The Scots also argue that the market would be better served if the data
were audited.

"Using audited information would result in the preliminary announcement
being an extract of the annual report which provides a consistent level
of information across all companies," said Graeme Bissett, convener of
the institute's Accounting Standards Committee.

At present, Stock Exchange rules stipulate that prelim figures must
have been "agreed" with the auditors. Bissett claimed this requirement
had been"intepreted differently by different companies".

The ASB is expected to review the subject of prelims soon and ICAS's
comments are the latest contribution to an expanding debate.

The Big Six firm KPMG recently argued that prelims could be materially
curtailed if they were largely replaced by the immediate filing of
audited statutory results (see TA 5914).

GOVERNANCE POLICIES SHOWN TO BE UNRELATED TO PROFITS

A NEW STUDY has failed to identify any link between good corporate
governance and improved financial performance in the vast majority of
leading European companies. Only in the UK was a "slight correlation"
detected.

The finding comes in a survey of European corporate governance by
Deminor, a Brussels-based consultancy which advises minority
shareholders. The widespread absence of such a link, the company
speculates, suggests the relationship between corporate governance and
financial performance could only be proved "in the medium-term". Large
American pension funds have established a link on the basis of much
larger statistical data, the report points out. This explains why a
growing number of Anglo-Saxon and other institutional investors
"explicitly take corporate governance standards into account when
investing in European companies", Deminor adds.

Overall, the UK was furthest advanced in the field, ahead of (in order)
France, Germany and Belgium. Holland was placed last among the five
countries surveyed. A large majority of Dutch companies, the report
says, employs fiduciary mechanisms and structures unknown elsewhere
which produce "serious and significant distortions between ownership
and control".

Deminor analysed how shareholders were treated in main stock indices of
each country - FT-30 (UK), CAC-40 (France), DAX (Germany), AEX
(Holland) and BEL-20 (Belgium). Publicly available information from a
total of 140 companies was surveyed, including annual reports and
companies' bye-laws.

Scores were awarded against a range of criteria, such as use of board
committees and quality of information to shareholders. Final rankings
were then compared with financial performance based on EPS/Stock Price
ratio.

In addition to the rankings, three other main conclusions emerged. Some
corporate governance issues are neglected everywhere; countries differ
widely on certain criteria; and there remains much room for
improvement.

Few corporations provided information on directors' independence and
the internal working of the board. On director's remuneration and the
issue of board committees, however, a clear divergence emerged.

British companies complying with the Greenbury Code reveal much about
how they pay directors. But in most other countries, with the exception
of a few French companies, shareholders are given only an aggregate
amount of total remuneration. Other countries have also been slower
than the UK (and to a lesser extent France) to respond to the idea of
establishing specialised committees for tasks such as directors'
remuneration and selection.

The UK, Germany and Belgium were found to be the only countries that
largely adhere to the "one-share - one vote" principle. In France and
Holland, shareholders holding multiple voting rights are more common.

In most countries, Deminor says, voting at general meetings and filing
resolutions remain a problem. "Cumbersome" deposit requirements and
problematic proxy voting are identified as two areas where improvements
are needed. Companies incorporated in special forms (eg Societes en
Commandites par Actions in France, Stichting Administatiekantoor in the
Netherlands)"are often used to seal off management from shareholders",
the study alleges.

Despite the wide disparities in performance, Deminor believes across-
the-board reform is inevitable.

BACKING FOUND FOR DERIVATIVES STATUS QUO

NEW EVIDENCE has emerged which will lend useful ammunition to opponents
of a planned overhaul of derivative accounting rules in the United
States. A survey of 139 organisations which use derivatives has found a
high-level of consistency in their accounting for the four main types
of derivative instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options).

Over 90 percent of respondents match the accounting with the economics
of the transaction, by recognising the effects of the derivative
instrument at the same time as the hedged item. The survey, by KPMG
Peat Marwick, was released on October 11, the deadline date for
comments on derivatives accounting proposals issued in the summer by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. FASB wants derivatives to be
carried on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value, a
suggestion which has sparked controversy (see TA 5911).

Overall, 96 percent of respondents require correlation between the
effects of the derivative and the hedged item, while 91 percent require
the derivative to be linked to specific assets or liabilities or
homogenous pools.

Some 99 percent of those surveyed reported that they require
derivatives instruments to be designated and documented as relating to
a particular risk management strategy in order to qualify for risk
management accounting.

The vast majority of organisations require a specific assessment of the
risks being managed for derivative instruments to qualify for special
treatment, though practice varied in the criteria used to define and
evaluate risk. Just 18 percent of respondents believed FASB's proposals
would be an improvement on present practice - though there was
recognition that modifications were needed.

"The survey results indicate the respondents utilise a similar
accounting framework," commented Ken Russell, a partner in KPMG Peat
Marwick's professional practice department."Guidance from the FASB is
needed to establish specific details of how the existing framework is
to be applied."

DIRECTORS' PAY RETREAT BY AUSTRALIAN UIG

THE AUSTRALIAN Urgent Issues Group (UIG) has shied away from the issue
of forcing companies to decide how much of a director's pay is linked
to performance.

After several meetings considering the issue, UIG said in a statement
that the subject should be addressed through a full review of
disclosure requirements - something UIG made clear is beyond its remit.

UIG plans to issue a checklist of items that should be included in
adding up the director's remuneration.

`BLACK HOLE' FEARS PROMPT MD&A PLEA

THE AUSTRALIAN Society of CPAs says Australian companies should be
required to include management discussion and analysis (MD&A)-style
statements in their annual reports.

Potential investors are "faced with a black hole" when it comes to
obtaining a meaningful assessment of Australian businesss performance
or prospects, claimed ASCPA national president Professor Scott
Henderson.

Little known in Australia, but employed extensively in the US and the
UK, MD&A-type reports require company directors to explain current
results and comment on future performance.

"A handful of companies in Australia provide MD&A narratives, chiefly
subsidiaries of US companies and those listed on overseas exchanges.
But there is a long way to go before the practice becomes a standard
feature of good corporate governance," Henderson added.

CADBURY COMPLIANCE CONTINUES TO CLIMB

COMPLIANCE WITH the Cadbury Code on corporate governance increased in
1995, according to a survey of 100 top UK-listed companies. The study,
by Coopers & Lybrand, found that compliance among FT 100 companies has
reached 97 percent.

The main area of non-compliance is the code's recommendation of
appointing at least three non-executives. Among smaller listed
companies, 27 percent failed to adhere to this principle.

Elsewhere, the survey comments on the recommendation that directors
should report on the effectiveness of their systems of internal
financial control. This has focused the attention of boards on this
subject in a way that has never happened before, it says. However,
descriptions of internal financial control were found to vary in length
and quality, with better companies giving tangible examples of steps
taken.

Unsurprisingly, few companies are willing to indicate where there may
be weaknesses. And only a "handful" gave opinions on the effectiveness
of internal control systems.

BITTER PILL FOR SUGAR ON PLAYERS' TRANSFERS

ONE OF English soccer's top club owners has urged the industry to write
off player values over the life of their contracts to reflect the
impact of a European Court ruling expected to decimate the money-
spinning transfer system.

Alan Sugar, who owns 40 percent of Tottenham Hotspur, made the plea as
he announced a one-off player write-down of #7.29 million ($11 million)
that has sharply cut the club's profits. Under the so-called Bosman
ruling, clubs can no longer demand a fee for out-of-contract players
seeking to move between clubs in the European Community (see CA 5913).
The adjustment reflects Tottenham's assessment of the diminution of
player values this may cause.

The move reduced the club's net assets from #37.4 million to #25.3
million.

Tottenham was the only club in England's top division to capitalise
player values in 1994/95. The write-down reflects its decision to begin
amortising to residual values of zero.

Newcastle United, which valued players at #10.9 million in its 1993/94
accounts, reacted to Bosman by taking players off the balance sheet
altogether.

CHARITY GOVERNANCE LAPSES DISCOVERED

UK CHARITIES urgently need to improve key aspects of their financial
management in the wake of the Cadbury report, new evidence suggests.

A study of the financial governance of 18 charities by Birmingham
Business School found that few have independent audit committees
consisting of non-executives. Those which do rarely exclude executive
trustees and often include paid executives.

The authors, professors Trevor Gambling and Rowan Jones, ask whether
all charities should have an audit committee. They suggest such a
committee could meet a minimum of twice a year with only the external
auditor and non-executive trustees in attendance.

The report, sponsored by the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales and the Charities Aid Foundation, raises a number of issues.

Not one of the charities surveyed had a coherent policy on the
accumulation and disposal of reserves. Large proportions or even
multiples of annual expenditure are being either "taken out of thin
air" or small surpluses are squirreled away "against a rainy day".

The report asks if charities should spend the whole of their income
every year, subject to making provision for long-term liabilities and
properly calculated future reserves.

New arrangements for financial reporting by charities in England and
Wales came into force this year. These include a statutory requirement
for the financial statements of unincorporated charities, as well as
charities constituted as companies, to be audited by registered
auditors.

The new arrangements also impose a duty on charities' auditors to
report certain matters which may be found in the course of their work
to the watchdog Charity Commission. In October, the Auditing Practices
Board issued new guidance on the audit of charities which takes the new
requirements into account.

DATA SHORTFALL HIGHLIGHTED FOR ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURES by UK companies do not generate enough
information for analysts and fail to meet "best practice" guidelines
laid down by the Accounting Standards Board. So concludes a new survey
by Edinburgh accounts monitor, Company Reporting.

The study found that those companies which include derivatives in their
accounts do so at nominal value. "From this measure alone an analyst
would find it very hard to formulate an idea of value and risk," the
survey concludes.

The ASB published new proposals on the disclosure and measurement of
financial instruments in the summer (see TA 5912). They contain interim
recommendations designed to improve current practice until new
standards appear.

The ASB's long-term aim of current valuation was used by only 5 percent
of relevant companies analysed."It is clear that present practice is
some distance from the ASB's `best practice' specifically in terms of
current value and risk measurement," the report concludes.

LIFE INSURANCE STANDARDS ARE OVERHAULED

A NEW series of actuarial standards will help investors and analysts
compare the results of Australian life insurance companies.

The first standard, released in mid-October, will force life companies
to revamp the way they calculate profits and their obligations to
policy holders.

Actuarial Standard 1.01 on Valuation of Policy Liabilities, produced by
the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board (LIASB), overlaps with a
draft accounting standard released by the Australian Accounting
Standards Board (AASB) in August. But AS 1.01 differs in certain
details, in particular on how to calculate profit margins from life
policies.

When the AASB released its own draft standard, ED 73, some of the
details on the calculations - known as "premium splitting" - had not
been finalised and are not expected to be finalised for another three
years.

LIASB chairman Peter Vinson said the differences between the actuarial
and the accounting standard were at the"third level of detail". The
LIASB approach was the result of almost a decade of discussions in
which he had been involved, he added.

Vinson hopes the AASB's approach will eventually dovetail with the
LIASB's. He believed it is still quite possible for both sides to
adjust their version of how profits should be treated so they ensure
they eventually agree.

There had not been sufficient time to ensure the two standards were
identical where they overlapped, he stressed, as the LIASB had been
required to produce a standard to take effect from December 31 this
year.

The new actuarial standard requires profits from a life policy to be
recognised over the duration of the policy - rather than be brought to
account when the policy is signed or be recognised in any other way the
life group chooses. Practices have hitherto varied widely.

Known as the Margin on Services (MoS) approach, the method ensures that
the life groups can only declare profits as they actually deliver the
associated services, and those services are paid for by client
premiums.

The actuarial standard also sets out the method for calculating how
much money the life company is required to pay out on a policy - its
obligations to the policy holder - and requires that liability to be
shown on the books.

Vinson said the new standard allowed the performances of life groups to
be compared for the first time. The new standardised approach to
financial reporting would assist the anticipated future public floats
of several major life companies and add another measure of
competitiveness within the industry, he added.

Actuarial standards have the status of law in the same way as
accounting standards and actuaries will soon have to deal with a
succession of them. AS 1.01 will soon be followed by standards dealing
with solvency and capital adequacy.

BUTTE SPARED GROUND-BREAKING COURT ACTION

AN ELEVENTH-HOUR climb-down by the directors of listed excavation group
Butte Mining has spared the company the dubious honour of being the
first to be sued by UK accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting
Review Panel (FRRP).

Butte has reluctantly agreed to make a revision to its accounts for the
year to June 1995, turning a profit of #339,000 ($530,000) into a loss
of #628,000.

Formed in 1990, the panel has never yet used its ultimate sanction of
court action to force companies into line with accounting rules. But it
appears to have come close on this occasion.

"In view of [the directors'] undertaking, the panel has refrained from
undertaking proceedings under section 245B of the Companies Act 1985,"
the panel said in a statement. Butte responded by saying it was "not in
the interests of the shareholders to pursue this matter any further".

The affair concerns accounting for shares in mining company Gem River
Corporation. A Butte spokesman said the company had received a
"considerable sum" in shares in return for organising an exploration
programme for Gem River in Montana and helping to float the company.

Some shares were sold immediately on the Alberta Stock Exchange, but 70
percent were "escrowed" and could not be traded immediately because the
programme's success could not be guaranteed.

Despite this, Butte realised the escrowed shares as profits in its 1995
accounts. The panel maintained that profit should only have been
included on the shareholding that had been realised at the time the
accounts were completed.

"We knew exactly what was there and believed profit realisation was
reasonably certain," the Butte spokesman said. He also complained it
had taken "some considerable time" for Butte to get a "clear opinion"
from the panel on what the treatment should be.

The revision has led to a downward adjustment in 1995 profits of
#967,000. The spokesman refused to speculate on whether the profit
would be realised in 1996. Butte Mining, which collapsed in 1991 and is
now a litigation vehicle only, is no stranger to controversy. A number
of the company's original directors were later charged with conspiracy
to defraud. And in June this year the High Court threw out a #110
million-law suit which Butte brought against the Big Six firm Ernst &
Young.

Butte claimed E&Y predecessor firm Arthur Young had given negligent
advice when it was reporting accountant on Butte's 1987 flotation and
in connection with the company's acquisition of North Butte Mining in
1988. The company had unsuccessfully tried to pursue the case earlier
in the US state of Montana. But the suit was dismissed in 1995 when the
Montana District Court determined it had no jurisdiction to hear the
case.

Butte resurrected the claim in the UK in the form of a counterclaim to
an E&Y writ for unpaid fees. As well as claiming #110 million which the
company claimed its shareholders had lost as a result of the firm's
negligence, the company's new management claimed an extra #110 million
in what Butte calculated was the interest accrued on the damages.
However, Mr Justice Lightman ruled it was not"just or appropriate" for
Butte to be allowed to resurrect the claim.

GERMAN GOVERNANCE SHAKE-UP SET FOR 1998

GERMANY HAS moved one step closer to the reform of corporate governance
with a set of proposed changes which may become law in 1998.

A parliamentary committee headed by the ministers of justice and
economics wants stricter controls on statutory audits and heavier
responsibilities for supervisory board members at German companies. The
proposals stop short of any radical change, however, and may well be
diluted before they are presented to parliament.

On statutory audits, the committee's report is a summary of ideas which
have already gained broad acceptance with German corporations and are
welcomed by the accounting profession.

In future, the statutory auditor of a German company will be appointed
by the supervisory board rather than the board of managing directors.
That means the auditor's independence need not be reconciled with
business interests.

"It doesn't make sense for the management under scrutiny to decide what
aspects of the business should be audited," said a source at the
justice ministry in Bonn.

In addition, every member of the supervisory board will have the right
to an advance copy of the auditor's report and the auditor will be
obliged by law to attend the supervisory board meeting on the year-end
accounts. Big Six firms in Germany say they already do both
voluntarily.

According to the justice ministry, the committee is also considering
ways to make the auditor's certificate more detailed and meaningful.

The stock phrases of unqualified approval still used by practically all
auditors, including the Big Six firms, include neither comment nor
analysis. But no detailed suggestions will be made until discussions
have taken place with accounting profession lobbyists.

Other reforms show that the committee's approach is essentially
conservative. An official petition against the supervisory board will
still have to be backed by 5 percent of voting capital, compared with
10 percent before. "We don't want the supervisory board to be
undermined by gratuitous petitions," is the view from the justice
ministry.

The committee has also refused to bow to public opinion by reducing the
maximum number of supervisory board positions any individual may hold.
"It's very difficult to set fixed limits," said the justice ministry
source."It depends on the person's intellectual powers. For some
people, even one board position would be too many."

Only one of the proposals is not already standard in countries with
reformed systems of corporate governance. This is that banks which hold
a shareholding of more than 5 percent in a listed company may no longer
exercise their custody clients' voting rights in that company as well.

Even institutional investors in Germany typically allow their custodian
bank to decide how to use their voting rights, often giving the banks
an additional voting strength of several percent. This additional
voting power makes the banks even more powerful, say critics of the
current system.

But the government is concerned about the implications. It does not
want shareholder representation at companies' annual meetings to
decline, but knows it is unrealistic to expect all investors to do
their own voting, even by post.

One solution suggested by the justice ministry is to give an individual
executive responsibility for avoiding any conflicts of interest between
the bank's voting rights and those of its customers. From the banks
comes a suggestion to set up independent voting companies to handle
voting for custody clients.

None of these changes will occur quickly. After lobbying, the draft law
is expected to go to Helmut Kohl's cabinet at the beginning of next
year and will reach parliament a year later -at the earliest.

ASB PRODUCES `GENUINE' CASH FLOW STANDARD

UK COMPANIES will soon become the first in the world to produce "pure"
cash flow statements.

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has revised FRS 1, the cash flow
standard issued in 1991. Its aim is to improve communication of
information on liquidity, insolvency and financial adaptability.

The original FRS 1 brought the UK in line with international practice
by scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of
a cash flow statement. But its practical use convinced the board
further changes were needed.

Under the 1991 standard, the cash flow statement reported movements in
cash and cash equivalents (investments with maturities of up to three
months). But, because treasury management practices differ, the ASB
grew concerned that this may give rise to uncertainty about the
investments to be included as cash equivalents.

Under the revised version, only movements in actual cash (defined as
cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts) will be
shown as cash flows.

Proposals for reform of FRS 1 published last December in exposure draft
FRED 10 have survived with only minor refinements. Other main changes
include a new section providing expanded disclosures on the management
of liquid resources.

The orders and headings for cash flows have been changed to bring them
into line with those used in directors' commentaries (eg the operating
and financial review).

The cash flow statement has also been tied in more closely with the
balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flow on the widely used
financial indicator, net debt.

Cash inflows and outflows may now be shown net in certain restricted
conditions, for example, if they relate to a constantly renewed short-
term facility or a commercial paper programme.

The revised FRS1 becomes mandatory on March 23 next year.

As The Corporate Accountant went to press, the International Accounting
Standards Committee published proposals on accounting for pensions and
employee benefits which are out of step with current UK practice.

Exposure draft E54 recommends valuations of future benefit obligations
at each balance-sheet date (not every three years as is standard in the
UK). The draft says these should reflect market conditions at the year
end, in contrast with the UK practice of using longer term actuarial
estimates.

ANDERSEN REJECTS BLAME FOR WICKES

Big Six star performer Arthur Andersen is adamant it could not have
done any more to thwart a multi-million accounting cover-up at UK DIY
retailer Wickes. Paul Rogerson reports

ARTHUR ANDERSEN is refusing to accept any blame for failing to spot
accounting errors which led audit client Wickes, the DIY chain, to
overstate profits by #51 million ($80 million).

The firm responded defiantly to a letter to shareholders, despatched by
the company on October 16, which claimed Andersen "should have reacted
more effectively" to "warning signals" of false accounting.

"We were the victims of every auditor's nightmare - a skilfully
executed, collusive fraud which deceived everybody," risk management
partner Chris Nunn said.

The incident has once again focused attention on how much
responsibility auditors should bear for detecting deliberate deception.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is
conducting a campaign to alert firms to the threat of fraud in an
environment where financial scandals are increasingly likely to trigger
"deep-pocket" negligence claims (see TA 5913).

In this case Andersen appears to have escaped a lawsuit. After
consulting with its lawyers Wickes has decided to take no action. But
the company has reserved the right to do so "in the event that further
matters emerge".

Wickes shares have been suspended on the London Stock Exchange since
June, when it was first announced problems had been found in the timing
of the recognition of profits from suppliers' rebate schemes.

The irregularities resulted from discrepancies between the supply
contracts reported to senior management and those actually negotiated
by buying staff.

Under arrangements which are common in the retail industry, Wickes and
its suppliers negotiated incentive arrangements under which the chain
would be rewarded for achieving target levels of sales of particular
products with either a discount or a rebate.

It also took up-front payments from suppliers for marketing costs or in
return for shelf-space, often tied to a pledge to achieve a certain
volume of sales.

The letter to shareholders, from new chairman Michael von Brentano,
follows an investigation into the company's accounts by Price
Waterhouse and lawyers Linklaters & Paines.

The probe has confirmed there was "serious mismanagement" in certain
Wickes operations. Problems were centred on the company's buying
department, where investigators found "deliberate misrepresentation" of
certain deals with suppliers.

The rebates and contributions which senior management required the
department to obtain ran into tens of millions of pounds. They amounted
to #13 million in 1993 and rose to #30 million in 1994 and #57 million
in 1995.

In many cases these sums were booked as profit in the year the deals
were signed rather than spread over the period of the supply
agreements, the investigation found.

In some instances the rebates booked to profit were not actually
receivable or Wickes was required to meet unrealistic volume targets.
Some deals were also found to be uncommercial.

As a result of the deception, the group's 1994 and 1995 accounts
included significant levels of rebates and contributions which had not
been earned. The necessary adjustments announced by von Brentano have
slashed Wickes's consolidated shareholders' funds by #51 million.

The probe found' that "ultimate responsibility" for the debacle must be
borne by former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum. The
investigators found no evidence that he or any other directors were
aware of the deception.

But Sweetbaum and a number of other individuals agreed to repay
substantial sums in profit-linked bonuses. Wickes has agreed to take no
further action against them.

Andersen approved an accounting policy for supplier rebates and
contributions, but the "underlying substance of many deals did not
accord with it", the report said. Instances came to light in 1995 of
amounts being booked to profit earlier than was justified.

"The board believes that senior management and the auditors should have
reacted more effectively to these warning signals. These matters were
not brought to the attention of the Audit Committee, which was assured
by senior management and by Arthur Andersen that the rebates and the
contributions were shown properly in the group accounts."

Andersen is to resign as auditor when work on restating the 1995
accounts is finished but Nunn was adamant the firm could not reasonably
have been expected to do any more to uncover the deception. He pointed
to the letter's concession that "false or misleading documents produced
to the auditors misdescribed the nature of suppliers' payments and
concealed the true position. "Third party confirmations are the highest
quality verifications an auditor can receive," said Nunn.

If they are falsified, the auditor has little chance to discover what's
going on until the amounts become too big to conceal."

Under UK auditing standard SAS 110, auditors must plan and conduct
audit work to have a reasonable expectation of detecting a material
misstatement in the accounts caused by fraud.

"In 1995 the work that was done confirmed to the best of the evidence
available that there were no hidden agendas or conditionalities
attached to the supplier rebates," said Nunn.

"Even now, having focused on what we might have done differently, one
has to say the answer is `very little'. If every report points in a
certain direction it is difficult for auditors simply to say `you're
lying'. It will always be the case where one is fighting this kind of
thing, one cannot be 100 percent certain of detecting it."

It is reported that neither the UK's Serious Fraud Office nor the
Department of Trade and Industry is likely to take further action.
A"thorough review" of the group's controls and procedures is now under
way.

Disciplinary action has been taken against two ex-directors with
responsibility for the buying department and more is planned against
certain middle-ranking executives and junior employees.

NOT SUCH GREAT EXPECTATIONS

The Hampel committee on corporate governance is proceeding with
extreme caution. Paul Rogerson reports

IT WOULD be folly to expect anything too radical from the committee on
corporate governance led by Ronald Hampel. Or so it would seem, judging
by a recent speech by the ICI chairman to a conference attended by 100
senior figures from business, academia and the accounting profession.

Hampel rarely speculated on how his body might "carry the torch" handed
to it by the Cadbury and Greenbury bodies on corporate governance and
executive pay (respectively). Instead, he focused on what he viewed as
the damaging fall-out of the high profile lately attained by these
subjects in the UK. A "visitor from Mars" would believe that "a new
industry" had developed in corporate governance, said Hampel. It was
quite worrying, he said, that this had been attended "almost by
hysteria". In reviewing the landmark Cadbury code for listed companies,
his group seeks to provide an environment in which business can prosper
and grow, Hampel said.

"That is a fundamental behind all our deliberations. We must not
stifle, we must stimulate," he said. Responding to a question, Hampel
denied that the Cadbury code is stifling business. But the furore that
has grown up around corporate governance had "denigrated industry" he
alleged.

The Greenbury recommendations on executive pay were squarely in his
sights. "All the public debate has been about boardroom excesses and
99.9 percent of business has been dragged down with it. It needs to be
said all the time that business must prosper."

The Hampel committee has sponsored research into Cadbury and Greenbury.
However, Hampel said it would only have two sets of annual reports on
which to comment on the latter, so it would be "dangerous to be too
prescriptive".

The conference, at the London headquarters of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales on November 1, coincided
with the launch of a vast consultation exercise by Hampel. The
committee is seeking feedback from a wide range of bodies, including
some in Europe and North America, on different aspects of its remit.
The most important questions to which it is seeking answers are
paraphrased below. When responses have been assessed, Hampel aims to
issue a draft report in the middle of next year "to see if people think
our conclusions are appropriate". A final report will follow at the end
of 1997.

Given the political context of Hampel's deliberations, the subject of
corporate governance will continue to generate controversy. The
conference coincided with the publication of a report to the committee
by employer's body, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The
CBI explicitly rejects the concept favoured by the opposition Labour
Party that "stakeholders" such as employees, customers and suppliers
should be represented in boardrooms. The interest of shareholders
should continue to be paramount, it says, dismissing the idea these
interests could be accommodated in German-style two-tier boards.

Hampel may have set a laissez-faire tone for the conference, but it was
not adopted by every speaker. Anne Simpson, joint managing director of
governance consultancy Pension Investment Research Consultants, had "no
sympathy" for those who think companies are over-regulated.
Shareholders are beginning to turn up at AGMs "to ask questions and not
just eat the sandwiches", she said.

Simpson demanded an end to the rubber-stamping of management decisions
in votes and the end of discretionary voting. Increasing shareholder
activity has led some companies to try and rewrite the rules, she
added. They included British Aerospace, which moved to get rid of
the"crucial" shareholders vote on its annual report and accounts.
Ronald Hampel is a non-executive director of British Aerospace.
