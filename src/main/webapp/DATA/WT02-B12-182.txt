Japan: Boat People and Citizenship</h2>

<ul>


<p>

A group of 24 Pakistanis arrived in Kagoshima on a freighter and

received transit visas and then were detained on suspicion that they were

attempting to enter Japan to work.  They boarded the cargo ship in China and

South Korea masquerading as sailors, after buying sailors' ID cards from a

Pakistani company for about 500,000 yen each. <p>

A Japanese fishing boat carrying 100 Chinese thought to be trying to enter

Japan was stopped on December 11, 1996.<p>

The city government of Hiroshima granted Japanese nationality on December

19, 1996 to a child born of a Philippine woman and a Japanese father who was

married to another woman.  The decision followed a court-mediated settlement

worked out in the Hiroshima District Court between the mother and the Japanese

government.  <p>

The Filipino woman came to Japan in 1988 but overstayed her visa.  In

September 1991, she gave birth.  In April 1992 she filed the lawsuit against

the Japanese government to block her deportation.<p>

The court-mediated settlement followed a Justice Ministry announcement in

July that it would grant legal residency in Japan to divorced, separated,

widowed or otherwise single foreigners who are bringing up children who have at

least one Japanese parent.<p>

About half of Asian and Brazilian workers in Japan said they like Japan,

according to a December 1996 survey of 900 workers from China, Taiwan, South

Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Brazil.  The

migrant workers averaged 200,000 yen per month and their monthly pay ranged

from 250,000 yen per month for workers from Brazil and Taiwan to 180,000 for

Filipinos and 130,000 for Indonesians.<p>

Most Taiwanese, Filipinos, and Malaysians liked working in Japan, but a

majority of Brazilian and Thai workers said that they were not satisfied in

Japan.<p>

There are about 1.23 million foreigners living in Japan.<p>
