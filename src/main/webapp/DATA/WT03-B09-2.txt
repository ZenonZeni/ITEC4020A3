Mass General Pharmacy Slashes Zofran Costs,  May Drop Drug From Its
Formulary


To Harold Demonaco, pharmacy director for Massachusetts General Hospital,
there's no real question that Glaxo's Zofran (odansetron) effectively
combats the nausea associated with chemotherapy. But it's such a good drug
with so few side effects that oncologists have been prescribing it for
almost every cancer patient in the hospital since its introduction in 1991.
And that's busted Demonaco's pharmacy budget.

In fiscal 1993, Mass General spent $900,000 on Zofran, making it the
costliest item in its medicine cabinet. Facing a potential outlay of $1.4
million in FY94, Demonaco took action.

First, he and his staff sat down with the oncologists and hematologists who
typically prescribe the anti-emetic and showed them that there were less
expensive, equally effective drugs available.

Next, they focused on getting doctors to use an appropriate amount of the
drug.  Most patients were getting between 30 and 40 mg a day, which
wasn't very cost-effective because the drug came in a 30-mg vial.

Mass General did its own studies and determined that anything beyond 24 mg
a day would not create any additional response. In late 1993, Demonaco
issued guidelines calling for a 24-mg daily dosage.

Since the dose is being cut by almost a quarter, Demonaco predicts that
Mass General's Zofran expense should be equally reduced -- savings of
about $250,000.  That's impressive, but costs may come down even further.
A competitor has hit the market, and is making things attractive enough
that Mass General is "seriously considering dropping Zofran from the
formulary," says Demonaco.

SmithKline Beecham's anti-emetic drug Kytril (granisetron) was launched in
late March. Demonaco says that according to Mass General's reading of the
data, "these two drugs are exactly equal."

However, Glaxo disagrees that the two drugs are the same, and has refused
to enter into a contract with Mass General. SmithKline, however, is
offering a discount.  Although Demonaco won't divulge that price, he says
the hospital expects a 50 percent reduction in costs for each chemo
patient.

PBM Mania Erupts


As fashionable as cafe lattes, pharmacy benefit management firms (PBMs)
have become the rage among drug manufacturers looking to expand market
share and pharmaceutical distributors hoping to add to their service line-
up. In the last six months, the sector's been abuzz as new PBMs were
created and many were bought by or entered into strategic alliances with
drug makers.

Witnessed so far: Cigna buying a PBM; the drugstore chain Rite Aid forming
a PBM; the National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores forming its own PBM; and
Caremark allying with three major drug makers. Last week, two more drug
makers took the plunge. For details, see the story below and other stories
on page 4.

Diversified To Go Global With SmithKline


Following in the footsteps of Pfizer, Merck, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, SmithKline Beecham has marched into the pharmacy
benefit management arena in the hopes of gaining market share for its
products in the short term and steering R&D in the long term. SmithKline
says it will pay $2.3 billion for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, in a
move that will more closely emulate the Merck-Medco merger than strategic
alliances favored by the other drug makers getting into the area.

For Diversified, a pioneer in the management of drug costs and in the
outcomes research area, the link with a global drug manufacturer gives it
the opportunity to offer its expertise worldwide, says Diversified
President Henry Blissenbach.  SmithKline "has a real appetite to see if the
[pharmacy management] concept is applicable in Europe," says Diversified
COO Terry Wills. In fact, DPS and SmithKline have already gotten started on
that project. Blissenbach sees the deal as having long term strategic reach
-- in gaining new clients and strengthening the sales and marketing of
SmithKline and Diversified products and services, and in managing the
overall cost of disease.

Diversified, a division of the HMO United Healthcare, currently manages
pharmacy benefits for 11 million people and has a 30,000-pharmacy
network; its clients -- the majority being United-owned HMOs and other
managed care entities -- spent about $2 billion in 1993 on drugs.
SmithKline had sales of about $6 billion in 1994, half from
pharmaceuticals. The firm is also a player in the generic field.

NO DRAWBACK SEEN

Many see selling out to a drug company as a competitive disadvantage, but
Blissenbach disagrees. Even though he was among those initially warning
about the conflict a Merck-Medco merger entailed, he says "we did not gain
one client because they left Medco because of the arrangement with Merck."
In fact, in a DPS survey of employee benefits managers, the firm found that
most didn't know that Merck owned Medco; once they found out, most were
pleased to know that Medco could draw on Merck's assets and R&D know-how,
says Blissenbach.

Now he's a believer that it is possible to be owned by a drug maker and
still give the client the best deal. However, Blissenbach does say that
drug makers are using the acquisitions to buy market share. "Merck
purchased Medco and SmithKline [bought] us for our ability to market
pharmaceuticals.  They fully expect us to market SmithKline drugs in
preference to others when everything's equivalent," says Blissenbach.

But that conflict is not as troublesome as it might appear; in reality SKB
only makes about 5 percent of the drugs currently on the DPS formulary.
"There's an enormous amount of drugs that are needed to put a competitive
formulary on the street," says Wills. "It's foolish to think we'd push them
off in favor of SKB products." He also notes that DPS has no control over
its HMO clients' formulary committees.

ACCESS TO HMO DATA

The HMO element will be key in the SmithKline/DPS deal; SmithKline will
have exclusive access to medical data of the 1.6 million members of United
HMOs. DPS already has the ability to link the information from the HMO
medical claims to the HMO pharmacy claims. In that way, DPS can tell
SmithKline what impact its drug therapy has on cutting the cost of
hospitalization or other treatment.

The two will also pursue outcomes research and disease management.
Blissenbach thinks that no PBM will turn away a chance to work with non-
affiliated or non-owner drug makers, and he says that DPS will work with
others. But he thinks that PBMs will be extra attentive to owners or
partners. "There will be very preferred and less preferred -- that's where
you'll see different formulary concessions and different research
priorities," he says.

However, until the dust settles from all the earthshaking activities in the
drug sector, it will be hard to tell where everyone stands exactly.
That's okay with DPS. "A deal like this is made looking futuristically,"
says Blissenbach. But, he adds jokingly, "the "future" in this business
is only two or three years."

Risk Sharing a Tough Proposition, Says Fallon Exec


Many drug companies say they want to help large drug buyers keep costs down
through risk-sharing contracts, but at least one HMO executive says that
hasn't worked for his health plan. According to P. David Jarry, MD,
clinical director of pharmacy for the Fallon Clinic, his HMO has been
approached numerous times by pharmaceutical companies to enter into
capitated contracts or other risk-sharing agreements. There have been lots
of negotiations, but no one's ever signed on the dotted line, he says.

Fallon is one of the more innovative HMOs in the country. With 165,000
enrollees, a 483-bed hospital, and 23 clinic locations, the Worcester MA-
based HMO doesn't have a huge nationwide presence but is often cited as an
example of what the future will look like. Fallon is a perfect lab for
contractual arrangements. As a group model HMO, its physicians are
employees, which gives it a lot more control over its doctors' prescribing.
It also uses a closed formulary and buys directly from drug makers.

Explaining Fallon's inability to come to terms with any drug companies,
Jarry cites terminology as a major stumbling block; everyone's definition
of capitation is different, he says. Drug makers have approached Fallon
with deals to give Fallon a price for a drug based on the number of HMO
enrollees and the expected use by that population. Or they have suggested
"capitating" an entire therapeutic class. The idea is that both parties
would reap savings for lower-than-expected utilization and conversely
would pay a penalty for higher-than-anticipated utilization.

But, Jarry says, "with a changing market, people are reluctant to commit to
price or volume for any long period of time." From the purchaser's point of
view, "for this to work you have to have some kind of time factor that's
reasonable." A short term contract doesn't give the HMO time to analyze or
adjust utilization.

For now, Jarry says, "I don't think we'll see good capitation arrangements
too quickly because there are so many variables that have to be worked
out." In the meantime, he expects buyers and sellers to "stick to the old
standards": direct discounting, rebates, bundling, direct buying, and use
of generics.

Turf War Brewing Over Federal Role In Cost-Effectiveness Data


Action in Congress on the health reform plan may create a turf battle over
which federal agency should dispense quality and cost information on drugs,
medical devices, and procedures. In its health reform mark-up, the House
Commerce Committee is likely to propose an expanded federal role in
planning, assessing, and implementing guidelines. Chairman John Dingell (D-
MI) is likely to include a bid by Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR) that would give
more power to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR).
Dingell is also considering a proposal by four outcomes gurus that would
create a new federal agency for quality, panel sources said last week.

Wyden's bill would steal a lot of FDA's fire by having AHCPR or some other
federal agency set national research priorities and give prior approval for
cost-effectiveness studies. The bill also would expressly limit FDA's power
to regulate cost-effectiveness claims made by manufacturers in advertising.

An even more aggressive agenda is being pushed by RAND's Robert Brook, MD,
Dartmouth's John Wennberg, MD, Duke's David Eddy, MD, and Harvard's Paul
Cleary.  In late April, they outlined for congressional staffers what one
attendee called an "FDA for guidelines." Under the policy, the new agency
would identify wasteful spending and establish national clinical trials.

FDA staffers however, are bristling at the notion that their agency can't
be the source of outcomes and effectiveness data for the public since it is
likely to begin getting that from manufacturers who will submit it
with applications for FDA approval on devices and drugs.

A Hopes To Develop Cost-Effectiveness Policy by Year's End


While drug makers use more and more cost-effectiveness claims in
advertisements for their products, FDA is still struggling to develop
guidelines on the use of such data in promotions. Drug makers often claim
their products cut hospitalization days or reduce need for additional
therapy, but usually the claims are based on comparisons to placebos, not
other drugs in the class. For now, such claims will continue to be reviewed
on an ad hoc basis, say FDA staffers.

FDA has put on hold its plans to hire an economist to help develop cost-
effectiveness claims guidelines. Drug advertising division people say they
have talked to some outside experts, but "our scheduling needs and
expectations didn't jibe with theirs." So agency personnel will write the
guidelines themselves; they hope to have a preliminary policy in place by
year's end.

That doesn't mean there won't be a lot of "outside input," the agency
notes.  FDA staffers have been meeting and talking to many interested
groups -- drug manufacturers, managed care representatives, and others.
Officials have also attended conferences and industry meetings and held
small seminars at which experts in the field presented information.

FDA is finding itself in the midst of a storm of confusion over who can
give out what information to whom in the cost-effectiveness arena.

At a recent meeting of the National Health Lawyers Assn., an attorney
warned that FDA may be considering regulation of the pharmaceutical
information disseminated by HMO pharmacy & therapeutics committees to
their doctors. The information often makes superiority claims for one
therapy in a class over another.  However, an agency official says, "We
haven't even been talking about this internally." But, he says, if drug
companies prepare the material for distribution to HMO doctors -- in
particular if it mentions unapproved uses of the drug -- "we would look at
it."

Value Health and Pfizer Alliance: A Powerful Attack on the Outcomes Front


While other drug companies talk about developing outcomes studies and
treatment guidelines in their alliances or acquisitions of pharmacy benefit
companies, Pfizer hopes to be acting. Hooking up with Value Health will let
Pfizer take the short cut, says ValueRx president and COO Steve Linehan
(see profile). The ability to have cost-effective data in hand and to
eventually manage the cost of disease will be the key to thriving long term
in the drug industry.

The Pfizer deal with Value Health has several components: ValueRx will
aggressively promote Pfizer products on its formulary in exchange for
discounts; Value Health Sciences, a pioneer in outcomes research and
guidelines, will develop such data on Pfizer products; and Value Health and
Pfizer will set up a $100 million joint venture to manage care in certain
disease states.

Value Health has long been respected in utilization management, outcomes
research, pharmacy benefits management, and managed care for mental
health.

Other PBMs, such as Caremark or Medco, while having sophisticated data
collection capabilities, do not have lengthy experience in developing
treatment protocols, says Linehan. That gives his company, and Pfizer, an
edge, he claims.

Linehan says ValueRx has another edge in that it, unlike DPS and Medco,
won't be owned by a drug company. ValueRx will aggressively push Pfizer
drugs to its clients but only where and when it is appropriate, he says,
adding that ValueRx is likely to ally with several drug makers.

ValueRx isn't alone in trying to forge multiple alliances, as many see it
as the best way to guarantee the drug buyer that it will get the widest
selection of pharmaceuticals at the best cost and with the best range of
value-added services.  But Linehan says that "it will require finesse to
put together a multiple alliance of manufacturers."

Pfizer, for its part, is satisfied with partnerships, as it has also struck
one with Caremark. "Acquiring a PBM is a huge cash outlay," says a Pfizer
spokesman.  "We think our strategy allows us to be very flexible; it's a
highly complex, fluid marketplace, and if it does change tomorrow we're
in a better position."

FoxMeyer Aims To Play With the Big PBM Boys


FoxMeyer Corp., which claims to be the nation's fourth largest
pharmaceutical distributor, is beefing up its PBM operations, with a buy of
Scrip Card Enterprises, a Salt Lake City firm that has managed prescription
benefits for small to medium-sized employers. Pharmacies that participate
in Scrip Card will get a complete marketing package that they can present
to the managed care buyer that includes competitive prices, generics, and
utilization review, says FoxMeyer VP Bob Davis.

Also in April, FoxMeyer launched FoxCare Network, aimed at giving the
company's 4,500 independent pharmacy customers wider exposure to managed
care. The network, says Davis, will also let pharmacists use "the medical
outcomes management programs developed for [FoxMeyer's] existing pharmacy
benefit management company, Health Care Pharmacy Providers." No mail order
services are planned for FoxCare, but it may be provided through Scrip
Card. FoxMeyer will offer its help free to pharmacists, but hopes to get
more pharmacists to buy more drugs from FoxMeyer.  "I can assure you we'll
be more supportive of those who buy from us," Davis says.

Caremark To Add Fourth to Alliance


A few weeks ago, drug makers struck their first blow against the Merck-
Medco powerhouse, when several teamed up with Caremark's Prescription
Service division.  In the war to maintain and gain market share, drug
makers have come to realize that prescription drug management firms can be
potent allies. "Our goal with Caremark is to become a bigger player faster
in this emerging health care arena," says a spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, one of Caremark's partners.

Caremark, which covers 28 million people through its pharmacy management
programs, has also snagged Pfizer and an unnamed company assumed to be
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and says it is about to announce an alliance with a
fourth drug maker.

In the short term, Caremark will have an incentive to shift market share to
partners' drugs, says Caremark Prescription Service corporate VP Kris
Gibney.  Caremark will give partners' products preferential treatment on
its formulary in exchange for discounts. The more lives switched and the
greater market share gained, the better pricing Caremark gets, says Gibney.
Long term, the goal is to steer data on patient utilization and outcomes
back to the partners.  The Caremark partners will have exclusive access to
Caremark information.  Caremark has just hired former MediQual CEO John
Kordash to head information strategy.  Caremark will also collaborate with
its drug partners on developing treatment guidelines. Eventually, Caremark
will offer capitated arrangements, but Gibney says that the deals are so
complex that none have been successfully put together yet. Caremark will
rely on drug companies to supply educational material and guidance on
therapy and, most importantly, financial backing. But the firm will
continue to act as the middleman -- the "Chinese Wall," as Gibney likes to
say -- between employers and the drug maker. Caremark, like other PBMs,
will profit from that arrangement.

Makers and Shakers --
ValueRx's Stephen Linehan:  Putting Politics To Work


Being the head of the nation's third largest drug benefits management
company has its headaches, but it beats being a small-town politician. At
least that's what Stephen Linehan, president and COO of ValueRx, has
concluded now that he's taken a stab at both. With $300 million in sales
and 500 clients, ValueRx has Linehan racking up the frequent flyer miles
and constantly chatting on the cellular phone. Linehan, who was named to
run ValueRx's day-to-day operations in November 1993, has no regrets about
ending his foray into politics. In fact, his experience should come in
handy when it comes to implementing ValueRx's goals, which include
brokering strategic alliances with drug makers.

In the late 1970s, Linehan was on the board of aldermen in Lake Saint Louis
MO.  At first he was content in that role, but like every politician, he
thought he could do a better job than the guy in office. He won his race
for mayor his first time out in 1980, and stayed in for a second term.

Looking back, he can't point to any major disappointments in his mayoral
career, and unlike many short term politicians he doesn't harbor much
bitterness over the experience. He proudly notes that while mayor, he
helped bring the town its first hospital and helped settle a lawsuit that
paved the way for more growth in the community. But he eventually decided
that "over the long run I'd rather be successful in business than in
politics."

Armed with undergraduate and graduate degrees in business administration,
he moved in 1985 to MetLife Health Care Networks, where he became CEO.
After five years with MetLife, he spent a year as senior VP for Managed
Care at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kentucky. Then, in early 1991, he
moved to Value Health's American PsychManagement unit in Washington DC.

When Value Health merged American PsychManagement with another provider,
Preferred Health Care, Linehan was offered the presidency at Bloomfield
Hills MI-based ValueRx. He was happy to move away from the politics-
infested DC area. Value Health, based in Avon CT, is a pioneer in the
management of mental health and substance abuse costs, workers' comp costs,
and in the field of outcomes research through its Value Health Sciences
unit. However, the company was initially built around ValueRx, which was
established in 1985. By 1990, ValueRx accounted for 70 percent of the
firm's revenues, says Alex. Brown managed care analyst Eleanor Kerns.

But in the interest of diversification -- thereby cutting risk for
investors -- Value Health has expanded and continues to expand into other
businesses.  Kerns gives the firm high marks for lowering its exposure on
the prescription drug side. But ValueRx still accounted for a little more
than half Value Health's revenues in 1993.

A Perfect Fit

Despite Linehan's lack of direct experience in the prescription drug
management area, he feels that his background in managing health plans and
mental health care costs prepared him well for dealing with pharmaceutical
cost containment.  As a managed care executive trying to hold down
expenditures, "typically, there were two costs that stuck out -- mental
health and prescription drug benefits." That meant that he had to "become
expert in those areas," says Linehan.

At American PsychManagement, he was given the opportunity to hone his
skills at managing the tricky area of psychiatric care and substance abuse
treatment. Large self-insured employers and insurers came to American
Psychanagement expecting to see costs in those areas reduced. Linehan and
his crew delivered. According to Value Health, while Linehan was in charge,
revenues at American PsychManagement grew from $30 million in 1990 to $90
million when he left in late 1993. Also under his tenure, Value Health
successfully negotiated a merger with another huge player in the field,
Preferred Health Care Ltd.

Linehan says that demand for prescription drug management carve-out
programs is being driven by the same dynamic that led to contracting for
mental health benefits management. Purchasers "want more cost-efficiency
and better care," he says. Already familiar with that desire, Linehan
thinks it will be short work to apply the lessons he learned at American
Psych to helping ValueRx clients.

Riding the Crest

Linehan is taking over at a time of explosive growth for the drug benefits
management industry. Once, there were only a few major players: Medco was
the king of mail order, United Healthcare's Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services was tops in the HMO sector, and ValueRx was among the leaders in
contracting with Fortune 500 self-insured employers. Drug costs were an
annoyance, but not enough of a concern for many employers to spend the
money on a separate benefits management program. But the demand for such
services has grown as drug costs have risen, leading to a vastly changed
marketplace.

There are hundreds of players now, from small private firms to subsidiaries
of HMOs to wholesaler-owned benefits managers. Even Rite Aid, a chain
drugstore, has thrown its hat into the ring. Now, with drug costs in the
news and employers getting more accustomed to hiring experts to help in
problem areas, drug benefits management has become trendy, if not
essential. Not all benefits managers will survive; consolidation has hit
health services and will soon make its mark on the drug benefits management
sector.

Making A Mark

It will be Linehan's job to assert ValueRx's role as a full-service
provider and ensure that it grabs a leadership position in this
increasingly sophisticated market.

ValueRx itself has been growing by leaps and bounds. In 1991, Value Health
bought a drug benefit management and a mail-order company, and added more
management businesses in 1993. Revenues skyrocketed in the ValueRx division
from $177 million in 1992 to $364 million in 1993. Clients include Allied
Signal, American Express, Federal Express, Rockwell, Tenneco, and United
Technologies. In August 1993, the firm won a contract from the state of New
York to manage the benefits of 700,000 employees, retirees, and dependents.

One of ValueRx's biggest coups so far was winning a contract for
Ford/United Auto Worker employees in January. Medco and PCS also had been
bidding on the contract, which covers 275,000 workers, retirees, and
dependents. ValueRx expects the deal to add about $90 million a year in
revenues.

As part of the contract, ValueRX will develop a formulary, offer concurrent
and retroactive drug utilization review and profiling of physician
prescribing patterns. The Ford pharmacy network is closed -- meaning
workers can only go to the designated pharmacies. More importantly, Ford
will be the first major employer that has signed a capitated agreement with
ValueRx. "We're delighted to have their business," says Linehan, who calls
the contract a "win-win for us, Ford, and the UAW."

However, ValueRx will assume a great deal of risk. The firm assured Ford
the auto maker would only be liable for fixed costs involved in delivering
pharmaceuticals and managing the use of drugs to the workers. The downside
for ValueRx: It will have to absorb any overutilization or variability in
drug pricing.

Linehn says the way to beat that is through strategic alliances with drug
makers, such as the one it just signed with Pfizer. And ValueRx will be
working directly with Ford and UAW on getting workers to be better
educated drug consumers.  "Ford's not just interested in controlling costs
for the three-year agreement, but extending it into the future," says
Linehan, who adds that ValueRx is "doing what we can to ensure quality and
to work together to contain costs. The recognition is that they're not just
dumping off risk; it's all three parties working together."

Focus on Outcomes and Alliances

As Linehan well knows, the future of prescription benefit management is
entangled with the interests of drug manufacturers. Thus, ValueRx, like
many other PBMs, is focusing on developing its data and outcomes research
capabilities.

Although he still thinks there's a lot of ground to be gained with the many
employers and payers that still do not carve out drug benefits, once they
are under a plan, those payers are going to want to see continuous
improvement in their savings, says Linehan. The key to eking out further
savings will be effective alliances with drug makers.

ValueRx, however, will only strike deals with drug makers if it can
maintain control, says Linehan. "We feel we have to represent employers'
interest first because they're the ones paying the tab," he says, noting
that Merck's ownership of Medco has created the concern among buyers that
the focus for Medco will be to push Merck therapies.

And he says that it will be hard to give clients a full range of
therapeutic options if the company is owned by one drug maker. ValueRx
will forge alliances with several drug makers "and get the best drug
available for the person at the most cost-effective rate," says Linehan.
"No drug should be dispensed or prescription switched or changed unless the
data supports that it will be equal or better in terms of results for
patients."

Another important aspect of benefits management will be outcomes research,
and Linehan sees ValueRx as uniquely positioned for that job. Value Health
has two units that are intimately involved in outcomes research; ValueRx
will draw upon that expertise. "There's a real potential to demonstrate
that drug therapy delivered at the right amount and the right time will
save in medical expenditures," says Linehan. But even he admits that it
will take some convincing of clients.

"You have to work with an employer and tell them that spending an extra $5
million this year could save $20 million in other expenses." ValueRx hopes
to have the research in the future to do the convincing. But it will still
likely need some financial help from drug makers, says Linehan. He sees
ValueRx doing outcomes research in partnership with employer customers and
drug makers. The goal is to position ValueRx as the quality expert. Then,
"as the marketplace evolves, it should get us more business," says Linehan.

It will definitely take a politician's instincts to balance the competing
interests of drug maker, drug buyer, and drug benefits manager. Steve
Linehan's experience should help him navigate these tricky and untested
waters.--Alicia Ault Barnett, editor.

The Drug Industry Puts on a Kinder, Gentler Face


Covering up Armani suits with lab coats, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Assn.  (PMA) hopes to change its image with a new name and a new mission
that emphasizes its role as developer of "90 percent" of the drugs that
come to market. PMA will now be known as PhRMA -- the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America.  "The public relations spin is very
direct," PhRMA president Gerald Mossinghoff told executives attending the
association's annual meeting May 2. Outgoing PMA chairman William Steere
(chairman and CEO of Pfizer) spelled it out: "Our mission is research. It
is the defining characteristic of our industry."

The unveiling of the new improved trade group followed months of internal
soul searching driven by a failure to convince Congress, the Clintons, and
the public that drug firms aren't money-grubbing price gougers. Although
new PhRMA chairman Sheldon Gilgore (chairman and CEO of Searle) said that
PMA had made some strides in improving the industry's image, it wasn't
enough.  A year ago, said Gilgore, "we were a demonized industry"; today,
"we are less demonized."

PMA hired McKinsey & Co. to help the trade group become a better lobbyist
for its 100 member companies and win more points in the health reform
debate. Now the group will focus mainly on lobbying against price
controls, rebates, and other threats to profits. PhRMA has also hired
former Pfizer Washington office head and Glaxo exec Stephen Conafay to be
its new superlobbyist.

However, PhRMA still has an uphill battle convincing the federal government
that price controls are not necessary and large drug buyers that
manufacturers are ready to negotiate on price. The association's new
image was bolstered by holding its meeting at a staid Washington DC
hotel, not a lavish tropical resort. But Gilgore was seen getting into a
limo after a press conference.

Merck Wants Medicare Action -- If There Is Any


Trying to get in on the ground floor of a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, Merck sent a proposal to HHS and the White House last week
suggesting that the government allow private pharmacy benefits management
firms to use their tactics to control expenditures and quality for the
feds. However, it's not even certain that a Medicare drug benefit will
survive the grueling beating the Clinton health reform plan is taking on
Capitol Hill.

Under Merck's plan, Medicare would select up to three PBMs per region,
through competitive bidding, to manage drugs costs and quality for Medi-
care beneficiaries. Surprisingly, Merck advocates an "open" pharmacy
network; allowing any pharmacist who meets the terms to participate. Its
Medco business has used closed, exclusive networks.

So far, competitors haven't weighed in on Merck's proposal, but one says
that on the surface, "anything that applies the principle of competition
and private industry to government is good."

Salable


o FDA has cleared Bristol-Myers Squibb's Taxol (paclitaxel) for treatment
of breast cancer following failure of chemotherapy for metastatic disease
or a relapse within six months of chemo. Bristol claims that since the drug
can be administered in an outpatient setting that "this can eliminate the
need for an overnight hospital stay, resulting in greater convenience to
cancer patients, and potential cost savings to the health care system." The
drug was approved last December for ovarian cancer not responsive to
initial chemo.

o Prozac may get FDA's okay for a new indication, which should drive
formulary managers mad. The widely-used antidepressant has gotten an FDA
advisory panel's okay to treat bulimia.

o Adding another notch in its belt, Coumadin (crystalline warfarin sodium)
can now be used to prevent and treat blood clots associated with artificial
heart valve replacement. Clinical trial data collected from 1967 to 1990
show that "long term oral anticoagulation therapy significantly reduced the
incidence of thromboembolism" in heart valve patients, says the drug's
maker Dupont Merck.  However, the benefits need to be weighed against the
risk of bleeding, says a company press release.

o Minneapolis-based MGI Pharma launches its Salagen tablets for treating
radiation-induced dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients. The firm will
be handling its own sales and marketing, initially targeting doctors,
nurses, and hospital-based dentists. The factory price to wholesalers is
$89.50 per 100; patients should expect to pay between $2.68 and $3 a day,
says the firm.

o Pfizer will start immediately marketing Glucotrol XL, a once-daily oral
drug to control blood sugar levels in diabetics. Pfizer says the single-
dose regimen should "markedly increase patient compliance" and that "strict
control of blood sugar levels may delay the onset of eye, kidney, or nerve
complications of diabetes."

o A new generic form of Ativan is available. Schein Pharmaceuticals has
received FDA approval of its ANDA for lorazepam injection.

Notable

o Prayers for a cheaper alternative to the expensive H2 antagonists are
about to be answered -- and the war for the billions spent on them has
begun.  Mylan Labs, in conjunction with Eli Lilly, is set to begin
marketing the first generic form of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet
(cimetidine). Tagamet is losing its patent exclusivity on May 17; Mylan's
generic goes out the door May 18. Mylan will sell to wholesalers and Lilly
to managed care at about 30 percent off the brand name price. Lilly will
seek risk-sharing or capitated arrangements and will help develop ulcer
treatment guidelines. More generics are expected before year's end, and
some formulary managers suspect they haven't heard the last from Glaxo;
that firm will probably weigh in with some offer to maintain its virtual
dominance of the H2 class.

o Kodak bucks the merger and acquisition trend in the pharmaceutical field.
The company announced last week that it will sell its Sterling Winthrop
drug unit.

o A coalition of hospitals, insurers, HMOs, and other drug buyers,
including Kaiser, United Healthcare, and Premier Hospitals Alliance calling
themselves the "Coalition of Health Care Providers Concerned About Rising
Drug Costs," wrote to Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) May 3 seeking to ax the
Health Security Act provision that would extend equal discounts to all drug
buyers. The provision has been seen as a political favor to pharmacists,
but the coalition said that if approved, manufacturers "are likely to
respond by limiting discounts to all purchasers."

o Initial results from the AHCPR-funded five-year Stroke Prevention Patient
Outcomes Research Team (PORT) study being conducted by researchers at Duke
Medical Center found that the cost of stroke is closer to $30 billion a
year than previous estimates of $15-20 billion. The study also uncovered
huge regional variations in cost and success of treatment.

o With five new products, Merck's West Point Pharma now offers generics
that account for 20 percent of a typical drugstore's dollar volume in
generics.  The new products: alprazolam, carbidopa/levodopa, gamfibrozil,
ketoprofen, and naproxen. The products will be made by "several leading
generic manufacturers" and sold under the West Point label.

Roche's Syntex Buy Will
Raise Outcomes Profile


With its impending acquisition of Syntex, Roche will gain greater entree
into the world of outcomes research, where Syntex is acknowledged as one of
the leaders.  The firm has been using outcomes to determine whether to
continue clinical trials on its own products for the last several years.
But Syntex's relatively paltry pipeline and the fact that most of its major
drugs are facing generic competition has made it an acquisition candidate
for those same several years.

Roche is paying $5.3 billion, or $24 a share, for the Palo Alto CA-based
drug concern.  That's a 57 percent premium over Syntex's closing stock
price the last trading day before the announcement, but seems small when
compared to the billions being tossed around to acquire pharmacy benefit
management firms that have no R&D capability.

The Syntex buy is another example of the consolidation trend in the drug
sector as manufacturers look for ways to streamline operations in the wake
of declining profits.  If Syntex shareholders tender a majority of their
stock and vote to approve the deal, Roche will become the fourth largest
drug company in the world.  Syntex will gain a presence win South America,
Japan and the Middle East.  Roche gains not only Syntex's outcomes
expertise but its strong marketing organization, which has successfully
built a franchise around the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories Naprosyn (A
$700 million drug), Anaprox, and Toradol.

To hang on to Naprosyn sales, Syntex formed a generic unit, Hamilton
Pharma; it also recently got FDA approval to take Naprosyn over-the-
counter.
