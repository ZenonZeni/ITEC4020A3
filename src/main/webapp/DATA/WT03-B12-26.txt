INTERNET AND TELECOMS MERGER ANNOUNCED

Commercial Internet service provider UUNET Technologies and telecoms
carrier MFS Communications Company are to merge in a $2bn deal which
was announced on 30 April 1996. This agreement creates a combined
organisation with 50,000 business customers worldwide, served by 4,200
employees making it the most significant deal to be made public during
the prolific Internet World show at San Jose, California.

Until the announcement, UUNET Technologies, the longest-established of
the major commercial Internet access providers, had been seen primarily
as a partner of the Microsoft Corporation, but it now appears that the
company will back the link. Bill Gates, chairman and CEO of Microsoft
said: 'We are highly supportive of this merger with MFS, since the
combination of a facility-based telecoms carrier with a high quality
Internet service provider offers the potential for high bandwidth
availability at lower costs for end-users.'

Under the terms of the agreement, UUNET shares will be converted into
MFS common stock at the rate of 1 to 1.777776. The resulting $2bn (at
30 April close of market) valuation is one of the highest yet achieved
by a specialist Internet company in public flotation or merger deals.
It comes even though UUNET, like the majority of specialist Internet
service providers, has been running at an operating loss for the larger
part of its history. Once again this confirms the general performance
of the Internet-related stocks as a premium commodity to investors.

The combined company arising out of this deal will be strongly placed
to exploit the increasing synergies occurring between Internet and
traditional telecoms operations. The business will possess some 543
Internet points of presence (288 outside the US), putting it among the
best-developed Internet service operations in the world. This will be
supported by a substantial telecoms infrastructure. James Q Crowe,
chairman and CEO of MFS, in a prepared statement, indicated four major
areas of benefit to the growth of Internet-related business resulting
from the merger:

- Savings on UUNET's expenses for local communications services, which
represented over 40% of the company's network expenses.

- Combining purchasing power for international and domestic leased
circuits, thus reducing expenses.

- Improved operating margins through the collection of co-carrier
payments for dial-up Internet access.

- Improved sales performance for Internet activities.

Many commentators on the Internet have felt for some time that the
specialist Internet service providers such as UUNET, Netcom and PSI
were unlikely to prove sustainable businesses without the support of
larger parents, or full integration into existing, related
organisations.

NET FOCUS

Welcome to a new venture in Internet information publishing. Internet
for Business, published by FT Telecoms and Media Publishing, is a move
towards putting Internet-related factual information into the hands of
the business strategists and decision makers who will play a key role
in shaping the usage of these global network systems in coming years.

The Internet already attracts more column inches than perhaps any other
single area of new technology development, which is saying something
quite extraordinary given the importance of other technological fields
in modern society. Not all of this publicity has been positive, of
course, but there seems to be a wide-reaching consensus regarding the
importance of the Internet's future role in the global communications
industry. Surprisingly, the majority of readily available printed
information about the Internet focuses mainly on consumer applications
and services. Attention is given to commercial implications and
applications, but much of this coverage is hidden away in specialist
publications. It also shows an unhelpful tendency to wrap its content
in the technical mysteries and burgeoning jargon of the Internet
sector.

Internet for Business aims to change all that. The newsletter will
focus on the facts, presented as far as possible in lay terms, or with
clear explanation of technical terms and jargon. Internet for Business
will provide you with clear, unbiased and objective accounts of all
that is important in understanding the Internet sector whether
concerning new technologies, protocols and standards, typical or
outstanding business applications, company news or share performances.
For the sake of complete impartiality, coverage will be given to
commercial online services such as CompuServe and Delphi, in addition
to the Internet proper. However, it is expected that the blurring of
the boundaries between these organisations and specialist Internet
Service Providers will accelerate in 1996 and thereafter, leading to a
convergence of operation and activity across the network providers.

The Internet remains a young technology, in commercial activity at
least, and many of the companies pioneering the commercial application
of the system remain under-capitalised and inexperienced in the global
marketplace. The pace of change is quite extraordinary, and many
initiatives which look exciting today are likely to prove impractical
or unconvincing in the real world. For every Netscape Communications
there will undoubtedly be many failures, and ultimately the existing
major players in the computing and telecoms industries are likely to
hold the upper hand.

Nonetheless, the Internet, or something which emerges from it, will be
a permanent feature of our commercial and personal lives, and will
continue as a means of building new markets, developing new profit
centres, and changing and streamlining business operations. Internet
for Business will assist its readers in tracking Internet growth and
development, and in pinpointing the real opportunities for their
organisations and backers in coming years.

The editors of Internet for Business, Andrew Parker and Ray Attwood,
can be contacted by e-mail at intforbus@pearson-pro.com or through the
offices of the publishers, whose details are given on the back page of
this issue.

HARDWARE ALLIANCE MEANS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS

Late April saw the announcement of the takeover of StrataCom, a leading
supplier of telecoms switching equipment, by Cisco Systems, a market
leader in the manufacture and supply of internetworking equipment
including routers and LAN switches. According to Cisco, the new
relationship will provide an integrated combine, able to provide end-to-
end solutions across public, private or hybrid networks. The move
clearly represents a gearing up by Cisco to meet the expected future
growth in telecoms, Internet and Intranet technology.

The acquisition of StrataCom was carried through under an offer of
shares in Cisco common stock, in exchange for all outstanding shares
and options of StrataCom. With Cisco's common stock valued at a little
under $50, the total value of the transaction was in the region of
$4bn. Final confirmation of the deal is due by late June 1996.

Of most interest in Internet applications is the new group's integrated
ability to handle the advanced switching technologies which are at the
heart of state-of-the-art Internet network systems. The two companies
will have highly-developed expertise in the design and implementation
of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and frame relay high-speed WAN
switching equipment. These technologies are being increasingly adopted
by Internet service providers to offer far more robust and flexible
data communications technology, especially to corporate users.

MASS MARKET IN INTERNET TELEPHONY?

One of the most appealing, and yet controversial products to be
launched for Internet users in recent times has been Internet
telephony. A number of software companies have launched products which
allow Internet users with sound-enabled computers to make two-way
telephone calls over the Internet, throughout the world, for the price
of a local call (or free if they are attached to a corporate Internet
access).

This technology is soon to be delivered to a mass audience by Netscape
Communications, which has announced that an Internet telephony utility
will be integrated into the next generation of its browser software.

The new Netscape browser, to be called Atlas, will include an
application called CoolTalk, which provides the telephony capability.

Initially users will only be able to call other users who are currently
online. CoolTalk will operate with modems at data rates as low as
9,600bps.

Internet telephony has been controversial among the Internet community
since early versions of the software were bandwidth intensive,
blanketing out the more bandwidth-efficient activities such as Web
traffic and e-mail. In some cases Internet service providers even went
so far as to ban the process from their networks.

However, improving audio compression technology appears to be making
the technology more acceptable across the Internet. And it represents a
genuine threat to established telecommunications companies across the
world, especially to their high-priced international telephone
services.

UK NAME REGISTRATION SHAKE UP

A new structure for the registration and administration of Internet
addresses in the UK was announced in mid-April by Dr W Black, the
nominated manager of the .uk space within the overall structure of
domain names on the Internet. The change involves the establishment of
a non-profit company to take over the day-to-day processing of domain
name registrations in the UK, and of a steering committee of industry
representatives to oversee its operation. Membership of the steering
committee is open to all organisations with a legitimate interest in
the name registration process, and will be subject to an annual
membership fee. A system of name registration charges is also proposed
to defray the operating costs of the new establishment. All new
Internet sub-domain names, the core of the Internet addresses used from
day-to-day by all types of user, will incur the charges, although
special arrangements may be made for educational and other non-profit
organisations.

These changes, which will bring the UK into line with other countries
such as Germany, Japan and the commercial domain in North America, have
received a mixed response from within the Internet industry in the UK,
with some suggesting that the planning and decision-making process had
been undertaken with insufficient publicity and consultation. Lack of
information on the changes seems to have caused widespread
misunderstanding of the proposals, including some suggestions that the
move represents an exploitative change attempting to bring more control
of the UK Internet back into the hands of UKERNA, the Government-
established company which controls the operation of the UK's academic
network, JANET. This has been fuelled by the fact that Dr Black, who is
an employee of UKERNA in his current role, has been designated as the
first manager for the new structure.

More realistically, it is clear that stabilisation and regularisation
was needed in this area. There are some 6,000 registered users of
Internet domain names in the .co.uk area alone (this being the domain
name suffix allocated to UK-based commercial Internet addresses). This
number is increasing by 100 every week in second quarter 1996. It is
widely understood that current structures, where commercial Internet
service providers provide voluntary support to UKERNA in administering
name registration for specific sub-domains such as .co.uk, have begun
to unravel under the pressure of expansion occurring in the Internet at
present.

Under the new system, a fixed rate of charging will apply to all new
Internet address registrations - #100 for each new name registered,
covering the first two years of operation, and #50 per year thereafter
to cover the maintenance of the name in the register and central DNS
structures (the computers at the heart of the UK Internet which convert
the day-to-day use of textual forms of addresses into the numeric
Internet protocol addresses used in the operation of the Internet
between computers and networks). Members of the Steering Committee will
qualify for a significant discount on these full rates, on behalf of
their customers, which they are able to pass on in full or in part. It
is intended to commence charging according to the stated scales for all
new name registrations after 31 May 1996. Recurrent charges for
existing names will begin on 1 June 1997.

THE BATTLE OF THE BROWSERS

In almost simultaneous press announcements in mid-March 1996, Microsoft
and Netscape Communications both trumpeted deals confirming close co-
operation between their organisations and America Online (AOL), the
world-leader in the commercial online networks market.

Organisations such as AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy have recently moved
to offer far more flexible Internet access to their users, and have
shown a desire to integrate the best of Internet-specific software into
their user interfaces. Given their large customer bases (AOL alone with
over 5 million users worldwide), it is natural that fierce competitors
such as Netscape and Microsoft should vigorously woo these companies.

In the case of AOL, Microsoft seems to have achieved the more
definitive relationship. AOL has chosen to integrate Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser software seamlessly into its main user
interface, making it the main tool which AOL users will harness in
searching across the World Wide Web. In return, AOL has achieved one of
the goals long sought by the commercial network providers, the
provision of an easy access to its service for Windows 95 users, via a
folder on the desktop of the operating system.

Netscape, by contrast, has reached agreement that its Navigator browser
software should be integrated into the interface for GNN, a more
specialist Internet service operated by AOL. The browser will also be
an option for AOL users generally. In return, Netscape will provide AOL
with a prominent presence within its own Web site.

Microsoft thus appears to have obtained pole position with this major
user base, regarding Internet applications, and will offer AOL users
the benefit of its ongoing development of new Internet software tools
under the ActiveX Technologies programme. These include utilities to
provide animation, 3d, and video to the Internet.

Consolation for Netscape Communications comes in the form of a parallel
deal with CompuServe. Under this agreement, CompuServe is able to
distribute the Netscape Navigator software to users of its CompuServe
Information Service, its core group of online customers, and to users
of the Spry Internet access service, recently acquired by CompuServe.

These moves reflect the more general struggle between Netscape
Communications, as the developer of the dominant browser for World Wide
Web users on today's Internet, and Microsoft, the world's dominant
software company. Microsoft manifestly wishes to wrest away Netscape's
market leadership in this field, and is moving forcefully towards
achieving that end.

PRODIGY LOSES MARKET SHARE

A recent survey by Odyssey, the San Francisco-based research firm
indicates a shift in fortunes for the major online services.

In its Homefront survey, Odyssey found that during the last two years
the market share of the four major online services, America Online
(AOL), CompuServe, Prodigy and Microsoft show a dramatic improvement in
market share for AOL, while similar figures for CompuServe remained
static.

The big loser appears to be Prodigy, with a 50% fall in market share.
Recent reports in the San Jose Mercury News, indicate a possible
management buy-out of Prodigy from its owners IBM and Sears Roebuck for
a sum thought to be under $100m.

NETCOM'S FIRST

Launching its new UK operation and UK Internet access services on 1 May
1996, US specialist Internet service provider (ISP) Netcom became the
first of the major independent ISPs from North America to start an
operation from scratch in the UK.

One of the top three North America specialist access providers, Netcom
has come to the UK market late in comparison with major competitors
such as UUNET Technologies and PSINet. Both these companies chose to
launch into the UK market through acquisition of an existing local
provider. This latter approach has proved of mixed value to its
exponents.

The UK launch for Netcom - its first outside North America - capped a
satisfying early 1996 for the company, which saw its user base climb
above the 400,000 level in April 1996, and its first quarter revenue
for 1996 grow to $24.1m, a growth of 221% over the equivalent period in
1995 (Netcom figures).

Netcom has aimed high, in the creation of its UK operation, hiring over
50 staff by the launch date, and establishing a nationwide network of
virtual points of presence in collaboration with local telco Energis.
Users throughout the country will therefore be able to access Netcom's
dial-up services via a local telephone call. Heading up this UK system
will be new managing director David Clarke, who formerly had a strong
track record in high-level management with Compaq, the successful PC
manufacturer/vendor.

Among the more useful aspects of Netcom's service from day one will be
a full 24-hour, seven days per week customer service facility, and a
range of access services tailored to both business and consumer users.
'We believe we are the only ISP in the UK market offering a truly
competitive Internet solution,' said Clarke.

It will be interesting to track the respective progress of the three
major ISPs now active in the UK market over coming months.

UUNET Technologies, the new owners of Unipalm - PIPEX, arguably the
most effective of the indigenous access providers for the corporate
sector, has major distractions in its own merger with MFS, reported
elsewhere in this issue, and in the delivery of Internet access
services for the Microsoft Network in the UK and elsewhere. PSINet,
having acquired the UK arm of Pan-European provider EUnet, has gone
through a drawn-out process of infrastructure and staff re-development,
to meet the high standards set by its service in the US. Consequently
it has been seen to move backwards in the eyes of many commentators, in
terms of customer credibility and market performance. A full launch of
PSINet's consumer and commercial access services in the UK has still
not been achieved, some seven or eight months after the EUnet GB
acquisition took place.

Given the relative position of these three major players, and the still
small scope of BT's Internet access operation, it may well be advisable
for business users at least to take advice on Netcom's services,
despite their greenness in the UK market.

Netcom may be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.netcom.net.uk.
In addition to providing details on Netcom's UK operations and
services, the site provides a NetNews section, a Web search facility, a
directory of UK Web sites, customer support and frequently-asked
questions (FAQ) information.

SEARCHING SUCCESS FOR DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION

Digital Equipment Corporation Alta Vista search for the World Wide Web,
a latecomer in the field by comparison with other services such as
Lycos, Yahoo and Infoseek, received recognition of its effectiveness
through receipt of an Industry Award for Outstanding Service from US
publication Internet World.

The award, which was announced during the Internet World show in San
Jose, recognises Alta Vista's immediate and widespread adoption by Web
users, since launching in December 1995.

Identified as the most comprehensive search site on the Web during
Internet World's recent testing of search services, Alta Vista has
become a must-use tool for many Web surfers during its short history.
Digital Equipment's own statistics tell the story, with the site now
reaching as many as seven million hits per day.

Since inception, the index maintained for the Alta Vista site has grown
from 16 million full text pages to 22 million (as at April 1996) with
over 11 billion words. The index also covers more than 13,000 of the
USENET newsgroups available over the Internet.

During Internet World in San Jose, Digital Equipment announced plans to
develop the search engines used in the Alta Vista sit into a family of
fast search tools to be marketed into commercial and consumer markets.

AVIS RENT-A-CAR

http://www.avis.com

Avis has become the latest of the major car hire companies to establish
an interactive service on the World Wide Web. The site, known as the
Avis Galaxy, is operated from the US, but offers a worldwide service.

The most convenient aspect of the Web site is the facility to obtain
firm quotes, with a special Web users' discount, and to reserve car
hire bookings, for journeys at home or overseas. A trial use of the
site obtained a discount-rate quote for hiring an intermediate car for
a business trip in California, with the price stated in pounds
Sterling, since the quote was requested in the UK. When first seeking
this information, it was not immediately obvious how to obtain a price
quotation from the site, since the quotation service uses the same
interactive forms as the firm car booking system. But closer
examination showed that users can click on an option requesting a price
quote rather than a firm booking.

Apart from this quibble, the site appears to be well thought out in
terms of navigation, with tool bars at the foot of each page allowing
access to other sections of the site, or a return to the home page.
Users with the graphics capability of their browser switched off, or
with non-graphical browsers, are provided with text-based alternatives
to the graphical hyperlinks which are structured into the site.

In addition to the quotation and reservation service the Avis Galaxy
also provides information on special Avis services such as the
company's Travel Partners scheme and Business Rate Plans, details of
location of the company's main outlets, special offers, e-mail contact
information and a number of other interactive services. Many of the
national Avis operations covered by the Web information provide
pictures of the cars available in their country, together with textual
information describing their features.

The site is configured to be accessed using the Netscape Navigator
browser, and like many of this type, offers the user the option to
download a copy of that software, if they do not already use it.

A GERMAN PRESENCE

http://www.government.de or http://www.bundesregierung.de

The Press and Information Office of the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany has recently launched a Web site providing a range
of information services for Web users. Details on the site are in
either German or English, with a straightforward navigational process
enabling visitors to the site to select the language required. Site
content is heavily textual, overall, but this is perhaps appropriate to
the rather bureaucratic nature of much of the information.

Users will find that they need to delve fairly seriously to get to more
informative elements in the site, since the first few levels give very
general information which is neither searching nor loaded with factual
content. However, users should persevere, since the site does reward
more careful exploration. One of its most useful elements is a list of
German Web links under a number of potentially helpful categories,
including: general information on Germany; news and media; travel;
German Zip Codes (Search Engine); business and law; exchange programmes
and research; culture and language classes; sport; German government;
political foundations; and the EU and embassies.

The general information category, for example, offers links to a range
of more detailed sites, such as the Deutsche Welle, a government-
supported media organisation, the German Foreign Office home page and
the site maintained by the Goethe Institute, the well-known German
cultural organisation.

The business and law section offers links such as Germany's Top 500
Firms - an alphabetical listing and a listing by size (in English),
reports on German and European financial trends (in English) and
Biz.Travel, a server with information on doing business in Germany and
particular German cities, with listings of Chambers of Commerce.

Other interesting links include pointers to several news magazine and
newspaper Web sites, and a series of online travel services, some of
which provide online reservations and ticket sales.

As with many Web sites, the power of this site is rather more in the
further information which is accessible through it, rather than in the
information which it provides itself.

Anyone familiar with Germany, and doing business in that country, is
likely to find this particularly true, and may well only pinpoint some
of the linked sites as useful for future reference. However, newcomers
to the country and its business practices are likely to find the site
itself more immediately useful.

TECHNICAL AND MEDIA EVENTS CATALOGUED ONLINE

http://www.zdnet.com/zdi/calendar/calendar.html

The ZD Net Trade Show Calendar is a new service offering a calendar of
trade events, worldwide, in the following categories: broadcasting and
media; computer aided technologies; computer hardware/peripherals;
entertainment industry; computer software/services; Information
Technology; engineering; Internet/online services; publishing;
telecoms.

Extracts from the total calendar of events may be obtained using a
search form, which offers the ability to select a given country or
countries, any one or more topics, and a range of dates within which
the events should fall. The search results are presented as a table of
events, including their open dates, the city where they take place and
general subject coverage. A search may also be made for a single event,
using all or part of its title. For each event listed as a result of a
search, a hypertext link takes the user to further details on the show,
including venue information, event frequency, and in some cases details
of visitor and exhibitor attendance at the previous occurrence of the
event.

A test search was performed, retrieving all the events listed during
calendar 1996 covering the topic of Internet. The resulting list
included 16 trade exhibitions and conferences, with the major Internet
events such as Internet World International, Networld and Interop and
Online Information, general computing events such as Comdex/UK,
Computers in Manufacturing and Software Development and more
specialised events such as ECTS, Manufacturing Week and MTQ - Testing
for Quality. The only obvious omissions were events which were launched
recently and were not yet widely-enough publicised to have reached this
US-based database (such as the new Internet '96 Show to be held in
London in October).

US data search specialist Informus is offering a full range of pre-
employment screening services for US companies on the Web, launched in
early 1996. Companies which wish to use the service are required to
sign up with Informus, and are then provided with an ID and password
enabling them to access a full set of information services online.

Informus places great stress on its security procedures, and the
vetting of customer companies before it obtains access. In this way
every measure is taken to ensure that only bona fide users are able to
access the site, preventing inappropriate or exploitative use.

Charges for the service are processed automatically online and the user
companies billed accordingly. Informus stresses the immediacy of
information availability and the facility for highly selective
information retrieval as the main benefits to users of working on the
Web. Company figures suggest that a typical search for a given job
applicant would cost in the region of $20 - $70, depending on the
nature of information sought.

The Web site is currently configured to offer the active service,
accessible only to registered users, plus a set of demonstrations,
background information on the service and a registration utility for
companies wishing to take up the system. An e-mail contact system is

GET WEBBED UP ON CANADIAN DOCUMENTS

Micromedia, a Toronto-based corporate information source, has launched
a new service on the Web to offer company and document tracking
services in the Canadian corporate sector. The service, known as
Canadian Research and Electronic Documents Ordering Service (CREDO),
offers searching across a 600,000-entry index of corporate filings
covering the Ontario Securities Commission and Industry Canada,
together with selected documents from the Vancouver and Montreal
markets.

Users are able to search for individual documents or companies online,
and to create personal information profiles which the CREDO service
will then monitor for them. Under the latter option, an alert is issued
to the user each time a new document is obtained within the profile
established.

Once documents have been identified for the user, Micromedia is able to
deliver copies to users in North America using same day or overnight
delivery services or three hour delivery locally in Toronto. Home and
overseas users may use the fax alternative. A full scale of charges for
actual document access and delivery is published as part of the site.

INTERNET LINES THROWN OPEN IN SAN JOSE

The Internet industry, along with its current and potential customers,
descended in unprecedented numbers on San Jose, California at the end
of April, for the 1996 Internet World conference and exhibition. With
over 350 exhibitors, and estimated visitor numbers in the region of
40,000 according to organisers Mecklermedia, the event is once again
the largest Internet-specific trade show in the world. Ray Attwood and
Andrew Parker were there...

Based at the heart of Silicon Valley, still the creative engine of much
of today's computer industry, Internet World achieved an impressive
array of new product announcements, mergers and acquisitions. Some of
the most important of these are described elsewhere in this issue,
including our lead story on the merger of UUNET Technologies and MFS
Communications Company (see front page) to form one of the strongest
operations in the Internet field. The event has been so successful that
it has been transferred into the Los Angeles Convention Center for
1997, the only exhibition and conference facility on the West Coast of
the US able to handle the show's size and complexity. Mecklermedia
sources predicted a likely growth to around 500 exhibitors for 1997
(citing the fact that a 75-strong waiting list for exhibit space
existed for the 1996 event), and to well in excess of 50,000 visitors.

Internet World's development as an event is a true mirror of the
development of the commercial Internet industry itself. Launched four
years ago, the first West Coast event only attracted in the region of
50 exhibitors, and less than a tenth of this year's visitor turnout.
This has changed to such a degree that all the major players of the US
computer industry were represented at the event in 1996, with the likes
of IBM, Microsoft and Digital Equipment using the show as a platform to
launch a plethora of Internet-related initiatives. Along with these,
representatives of other major sectors such as telecoms were equally
active, as exemplified by AT&T's launching of its new WorldNet global
Internet access service.

Not even the arrival of summer-like weather, with temperatures soaring
into the 90s, seemed to discourage the eager Internet users thronging
around the booths. However, the major impact of the 1996 event on
attendees was not so much in the new products and services to be
identified on a high percentage of the stands at the show. Instead the
lasting impression created focused on two areas. One is a process of
consolidation, as a host of companies active in the Internet sector
seek to build formal or informal alliances, merge or acquire within the
industry, and share technologies. Microsoft and Netscape, among several
others, are major collaborators in the establishment of the SET
protocol for secure credit card transactions over the Internet and
World Wide Web. Search engine and Internet search specialist Lycos has
licensed its core technology to Frontier Technologies for its
CyberSearch software product, a unique, browser-independent system for
performing Web searching and storing information on sites visited for
future reference. Traveling Software, producer of the popular PC-
linking package, Laplink, announced at the show its acquisition of
Milktruck Software, a pioneering start-up company developing offline
Web browsing and Web site capture utilities. These are but a few of the
deals and agreements which the show brought to the attention of the
wider world.

The emerging force of Intranets

The other major process within the Internet industry, highlighted at
the show, is the emergence of Intranets as a key focus of the marketing
and product development activities of the Internet sector. Intranets
are treated more fully in a separate article in this issue of Internet
for Business. In brief, however, these represent the development of
Internet-based software tools and techniques to provide cost-effective
and easy-to-use sharing of electronic information resources within the
corporate or organisational computer environment. This may be across
either local area networks or wide area networks. A new enthusiasm for
Intranets has been driven by recognition among Internet developers that
many medium to large-sized companies remain more open to innovative
information technology tools within their management information
systems, rather than in communicating with the world at large. Equally,
the tools available for the sharing of, for example, electronic
documents over a corporate network have been relatively expensive up to
the present, and Internet-developed software tools often allow similar
levels of functionality at lesser cost. Thus a major marketing
opportunity has been recognised by the wider Internet industry, and the
focus on Intranets has been consciously developed to allow clear
recognition by potential buyers of the different focus of products
offered in this area. The term Intranet was omnipresent at San Jose,
despite being seldom used across the industry up to late 1995.

Internet World 1996 was clearly a resounding success for its
organisers, and the buzz across the exhibit halls also suggested a
level of satisfaction among the exhibitors. It stands out as a staging
post in the development of Internet business. The continuing sections
of this article set out some of the more interesting changes, deals,
products and services which were aired at the show.

General Internet systems

Microsoft Corporation, in a battery of announcements, focused mainly on
its upgrading of the Microsoft BackOffice Server Suite version 2.0. The
enhancements launched during Internet World included built in messaging
and groupware software, a high-performance Web server and an updated
database, all with inbuilt support for both Internet and Intranet
activity.

Electronic forms specialists JetForm, of Falls Church, Vancouver
announced a new intelligent forms system for the Web. Delivering far
greater flexibility and complexity of operation than standard HTML
forms, JetForm's family of utilities will allow the implementation of
complex data retrieval processes over the Web for both Internet and
Intranet environments. Included within the family of software
applications are a Server for creating and uploading forms, a form
filler client programme for end users and the Web Connectivity Pak
which collects data from forms and delivers it to the server for data
processing.

In a similar move, Decisive Technology Corporation of Palo Alto,
California, launched its desktop survey software suite, under the
Decisive Survey name. Decisive Survey software is designed to allow
survey developers to create and implement e-mail mediated surveys over
both Intranets and the Internet proper.

Reflecting a slow but steady move towards better multilingual
capability on the Web, and on the Internet at large, Israeli software
developers Accent Software introduced a multilingual plug-in for the
Netscape Navigator Web browser. Using the Accent plug-in, surgers will
be able to view sites written in more than 30 different languages
transcribed correctly on screen, including the use of any special
accents or scripts which may be required. The plug-in also enables
multilingual configuration of all the operating information within the
Netscape browser.

Electronic commerce developments

Among the most eagerly awaited software utilities for the whole
Internet community is the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) secure
credit card transaction process. This protocol, sponsored jointly by
MasterCard, Visa and several of the giants of Internet software
development such as Microsoft and Netscape, will allow easy-to-use,
secure processing of credit card transactions over the World Wide Web.

Claiming to be the first software developer to implement SET fully,
Terisa Systems of Los Altos, California, demonstrated its prototype SET
software solution, which processes credit card transactions in a three-
way link between purchaser, credit card merchant and the banks'
international financial transaction processing networks. Terisa
confidently predicts preliminary availability of its SET software, for
inclusion into other developers' online systems, for June 1996.

A more detailed examination of SET technology will appear in an issue
of Internet for Business later this year.

Intranet solutions

Inmagic of Woburn, Massachusetts, launched Navigation Server, offering
a broad range of searching, indexing and cataloguing capability for
corporate Intranet systems. Building on search technology licensed from
search specialists Lycos, the new product allows users to search across
and display on screen, not only HTML documents, but also information in
word processor and spreadsheet formats. A further facility will be the
creation of HTML output dynamically from database material in native
database formats.

IBM announced a number of Intranet-related initiatives at the show,
including a series of firewall and security products, Web production
and editing software, and the integration of its infoSage service into
Lotus Notes. InfoSage is a news delivery service available over
Internet and Intranet environments, drawing on news feeds from
organisations such as Dun and Bradstreet, COMTEX and Information Access
Company.

A further announcement from IBM concerned the launch of Crytolope
technology, a system allowing the encryption of individual messages or
documents for transmission across Internet and Intranet services, with
access only available to the authorised recipient.

Internet news service

The Wall Street Journal announced its new Internet online service on
the Web, claiming it to be the first online news service to launch with
a subscription/charging structure in operation from its inception.

The Web site, known as the Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition,
offers a basic range of services, including headline information
updated several times a day, free of charge. Paying users will be able
to access more detailed information underlying the headlines, including
access to analytical and financial information compiled in the
Journal's newsroom, and to create their own personalised news profile
drawn from the full range on the service, which will then be delivered
daily to their desktop computer.

Subscribers who sign up with the service before 31 May 1996 will be
able to use the full site free until 31 July. Thereafter, the
subscription will be $49 per year, or $29 for existing Wall Street
Journal subscribers.

HTML editors, converters and Web site management suites

One of the most notable changes in Internet software over the past 12
months has been the vast upgrading of HTML features, allowing a whole
host of flexible services on Web pages. Among these are the ability to
handle details in table format, the Netscape-specific frames
technology, which allows the definition of several different spaces
within one Web page, each of which may be scrolled through and changed
independently of the others.

The downside of these changes is that many new codes and syntax
features have been added to the earlier versions of the hypertext mark-
up language (HTML) used to construct pages for publication on the Web.
Fortunately for users, the software industry has kept up with this
process, and Internet World saw the launch of a range of new or
upgraded utilities which allow point and click editing of HTML,
compilation of HTML documents from templates, conversion of existing
word processor or desktop publishing files into HTML and proving of
finished HTML pages within a true or simulated browser display.

Internet for Business will be publishing a more detailed examination of
these utilities, and exploring their effectiveness for businesses on
the Web, in a later issue. Among the more interesting software in this
field in San Jose were SoftQuad's new version 3.0 of its HotMetal Pro
HTML editor, the Spider HTML editor from InContext, and a piece of
software named HTML Transit, from InfoAccess, which allows direct
automatic conversion into HTML format from a range of word processor
file formats. Others active in this market include Adobe with its
Pagemill product, IBM/Lotus with a new utility called The WebMaster's
Apprentice, and Microsoft with its Front Page and Internet Assistant
utilities.

SoftQuad also showed beta versions of a new utility named Panorama Pro,
which employs additional document mark-up technology, drawing on ISO
standards, to establish style sheets for HTML documents.

This is a particularly interesting development, since style sheets for
HTML have previously been an unrealised wish for much of the Web
development community. Before Panorama Pro, the most likely candidate
for creating more controlled appearance of documents on the Web had
appeared to the Adobe's Acrobat and Postscript technologies.

However, SoftQuad has achieved similar functionality with much more
efficient file sizes, and its system looks to be one worth tracking.
Internet for Business plans to bring you up to date on this in a later
issue.

Internet access services

PSINet of Herndon, Virginia, took the opportunity of Internet World to
announce a new mobile Internet access service, WorldLink. WorldLink is
a flat-rate service irrespective of the location from which it is used,
providing what PSINet claims to be the industry's first master account
management capability via the Web. Connection may be made via ISDN for
between $29.95 and $49.95 according to bandwidth, or by modem.

Networked Internet systems

Computer networking giant Novell announced an agreement with TCP/IP
software specialists Frontier Technologies Corporation, whereby Novell
will integrate TCP/IP functionality into its networking solutions. The
system will employ Frontier's SuperNFS client software for TCP/IP
applications, with operation available in several languages including
US English, French, German and Japanese.

Java tools

Several companies move the Sun Microsystems Java programming language
closer to being the simple tool desired by average business and
consumer users by introducing Graphic User Interfaces enabling Java
application development without line-by-line code needing to be
written.

Among those in this field were PowerProduction Software of Hermosa
Beach, California, with its WebBurst Java authoring tool, and Aimtech
Corporation of Nashua, New Hampshire, with its Jamba Java authorising
software. Such tools move Java firmly into the everyday application
field, and may well lead to a far wider implementation of realtime
programming applets (as Java routines are known) across the Web.

INTERNET SHOPPING - TWO CONTRASTING APPROACHES

A major area of commercial activity on the Internet has been the
appearance of virtual shopping malls. These have met with mixed success
and the dream of opening a store front to a global audience without the
associated overhead costs of traditional retail stores has not always
proved to be successful in its realisation. Indeed many stores in the
various electronic malls have found sales of products to be meagre.

While some malls have closed, others have changed their approach using
experience gained in previous attempts, to modify or completely restyle
their retailing activity based on the experiences of Internet shoppers.
After studying the way shopping is carried out on the Internet and
gaining a clearer idea of the profile and buying habits of internet
customers, more carefully-targeted sites are now appearing on the Net.

Two examples of different approaches to retailing in this new
environment can be seen by comparing the Internet Shopping Network,
based in Palo Alto, California with Online Interactive which is centred
in Seattle, Washington.

The Internet Shopping Network was founded in June 1993 and is an
established player by Internet standards. It is now a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Home Shopping Network which has a 10-year track record of
TV shopping to its name. The purchase of ISN in 1994 was seen as a
means to expand Home Shopping Network's reach into cyberspace and gain
access to the potential of a worldwide customer base.

ISN's reorganisation

Originally operating as part of the plethora of online malls which
sprang up over the past two years - represented by a wide range of
different products and suppliers - ISN has now re-organised its Web
site with changes in site navigation, graphics, format and content
aimed at providing a new approach from a redesigned Home Page and
concentrating on a well-defined and proven area of the online market.
Not surprisingly this market sector is in retailing computer hardware
and software where ISN's experience has indicated the best results can
be found.

Currently ISN offers over 25,000 products from more than 600 major
companies and makes use of a special feature called the 'Downloadable
Software Store' to take advantage of the unique attributes which the
Internet can lend to retailers. At this site a customer can gain
instant access to over 45 software product selections which may be
instantly purchased and downloaded direct from ISN to the user's own
computer. Thus ISN users benefit from the major attraction of Internet
shopping - convenience and speed. This is particularly useful when
dealing with experienced computer users who make up a large proportion
of the purchasers and who appreciate the advantages of a site modelled
on new paradigms rather than trying to create a replica shopping mall.
This profile will gradually change as more shoppers are found from
within the ISN links to AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy. These are services
where customers will often tend to be less computer literate. The
recent addition of 'Power Search' and 'Subject Category' will help in
this case by producing a list of the most relevant product or products
depending on a customer's interest. This type of service, using the
specific searching strengths available over the Internet, really begins
to demonstrate the useful way in which Internet retailing can be of
benefit to less experienced computer users too. With the recent
agreement to retail many of Microsoft's popular packages through the
Downloadable Software Site, ISN will find an increasing customer base
among this group.

ISN customers of course need to register before transactions can take
place and this requires an approved credit card, e-mail address, and
billing and shipping addresses. Once these details are received across
what ISN claims is a secure network, then all future transactions can
be carried out using a membership code, with all credit card
information kept offline. ISN uses Netscape Commerce server for
commercial transactions with security features including server
authorisation, data encryption, data integrity, and user authorisation.

Another organisation with an agreement to sell Microsoft products is
Online Interactive, which will retail through its atOnce Software
Store, again highlighting the importance attached to convenience and
speed of service in Internet retailing.

The company uses an online sales process based on a high speed Web site
for marketing and downloading encrypted software from the Internet.
After the desired software has been downloaded in encrypted form,
Ziplock collects credit card data, and in a separate, modem-based call,
directly routes the entire order to a secure proprietary network with
no credit card information ever passing across the Internet. After
authentication is complete and credit card approval given, an unlocking
'Key' is transmitted to the customer's computer. Ziplock then installs
the software, decrypting it to make it available for the customer's
use.

A commercial twist

In addition to atOnce software, Online Interactive also operates the
FreeShop Online, which takes the original ethos behind the operation of
the Internet, i.e. free access to information, and gives it a
commercial twist. The FreeShop is a means of providing direct marketing
and advertising for consumer products and services which are promoted
through free offers. This provides marketers with the ability to reach
a large customer group for a low charge and for the customers to sample
products free of charge. Online Interactive claim that since its
inception FreeShop Online has generated more than one million
electronic orders for over 180 companies. Recent evidence indicates
that between 18-30% of visitors are buying as a result of free offers
derived from the site.

FreeShop claims to process demographic information and leads on a daily
basis by e-mail when a free offer is selected and in so doing allows
prompt interaction between suppliers and customers which they claim
will aid the formation of future customer loyalty. A twice weekly
consolidated paper/label service is also available for fulfilment
purposes. While statistical evidence is not readily available, FreeShop
currently claims around 100,000 orders per month and rising among the
more popular online retailers in its site.

The offers are grouped in intuitive categories to allow easier and more
effective browsing and it is again claimed that on average three clicks
are usually sufficient to move the shopper from storefront to order
screen thus alleviating one of the major design disadvantages of many
electronic malls where endless web pages of ill-matching links nullify
the speed and convenience of shopping on the web. The popular
categories for the site are proving to be computing, magazines,
finance, entertainment and fitness products.

The effect of promotions on customer response rates is particularly
interesting and can increase interest and acceptance of offers by up to
ten times. This is achieved by a mixture of chat lines, contests,
spotlights and a club newsletter.

FreeShop is designed primarily as a lead-generating facility for
organisations which operate direct marketing strategies. By operating
FreeShop in the context of services such as America Online, and the
Microsoft Network, Online Interactive gains access to many millions of
consumer and business users. Companies promoting their products and
services through FreeShop normally follow up any leads generated by the
site by sending out free samples, catalogues or other promotional
information in the mail. However, a growing number of companies are
resorting to delivery of electronic promotional information to FreeShop
users.

These two contrasting versions of consumer retailing over the Internet
are beginning to represent the way in which this medium can provide a
truly useful and effective service to consumers. As technology develops
and the experience of other electronic malls is put to practical use
the whole concept and presentation of such retailing will evolve from
the current designs to show marked changes which no longer reflect the
transfer of outmoded and inappropriate concepts to the Web.

Internet for Business will track further developments in this field and
provide regular updates on new developments.

INTRANETS - THE NEW GROWTH PHENOMENON

During the last two years, a great deal of attention has been focused
on the development of the Internet and in particular on the external
uses of the World Wide Web. As the Internet began its transformation
from a medium used primarily by government departments, academics and
researchers to one with a commercial bias, the spotlight still remained
fixed on the comparative merits of different corporate Web sites and
the traffic which they generated.

While the debate about 'hits' on a web site, together with the problems
of transmission times for graphics and worries over security all
occupied the media, a quiet but fundamental shift was beginning to take
place within corporate structures. This involved the adoption of
Internet technology and the TCP/IP protocols on which it runs to form
corporate-wide networks 'Intranets'. Lacking in the immediate glamour
or controversy that many Web sites have generated, this application of
the Internet has been disregarded by many commentators. Instead the
issues concerning the informative, PR, sales and marketing potential of
Web sites have all been scrutinised and discussed with increasing
frequency. As this debate made headline news much less was said about
the ability of Intranets to perform vital business applications within
corporate structures.

More haste, less thought...

It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in the frenetic rush to place
information on the World Wide Web, many organisations have put up Web
pages with little thought to strategic planning and the real benefits
which might accrue to the company. The desire to claim a place out
there on the 'Net' and promote the company image with Web pages full of
hypertext links and colourful graphics has also outweighed the more
prosaic but beneficial use of a strategy which uses one or more servers
to allow password entry for nominated staff, suppliers or customers, to
gain network access and use e-mail within corporate environments linked
to LAN-based information and interfaced with the Internet.

However, recent statistical evidence does indicate that companies are
now realising what the Internet and its associated technologies can
offer, and this is leading to a change in approaches to strategic
planning as the potential of Intranets impacts upon corporate minds and
begins to show up in future growth predictions. Zone Research, based in
Redwood, California, reports that during 1996 revenue from sales of
Intranet servers will outstrip those for general Internet use, and by
1997/98 will exceed Internet server sales by a factor of three to four
times. In monetary terms this represents a private Intranet market in
1997 of over $4bn, and approaching $8bn in 1998. It is thought that
over 50% of the world's largest corporations are now actively planning
to develop their own private networks in Intranet form.

Benefits of Intranet communications

With such a fast growing and lucrative market, many of the hardware and
software suppliers within the Internet industry are re-focusing their
sales and promotion efforts towards intranet applications. This change
of focus is set to become an established feature in future advertising
and marketing campaigns, and at events such as the recent Internet
World Show in San Jose, California, where many companies were featuring
benefits of developing intranet communications. Digital Equipment
Corporation, for example, announced an Intranet strategy that will
supply its products and services as 'Intranet ready'. By providing a CD-
ROM they can turn Open VMS, Digital Unix, or WindowsNT servers into
Intranet-ready systems, and in co-operating with Microsoft and Netscape
are ensuring that their customers will be presented with ready-made
solutions on Digital Platforms. Established browser software will be
supplemented by firewall systems, to ensure secure connection of the
corporate Intranet to the Internet at large. For remote users Digital
will then offer 'tunnelling' software utilities which allow authorised
individuals to access information within the corporate Intranet, across
the firewall boundary.

Promoting internal corporate networking

Novell's recent announcement of its new corporate Intranet server
called 'Inner Web Publisher' is also indicative of the new emphasis now
being placed on specifically promoting internal corporate networking,
and the move to integrate servers with software tools to make them
seamless and easy to use. This can be seen by the recent agreement
between Novell and SoftQuad to bundle HoTMetal Light (the freeware
version of SoftQuad's high end HTML editor, HoTMetal Pro) with Novell's
product and allow end-users the ability to take advantage of
increasingly sophisticated Web authoring and publishing software.

Intranets explained

With so much effort now being focused on Intranets, therefore, it is
appropriate at this stage to ask just what Intranets are, and why are
they so important? At its simplest an Intranet could be described as an
'internal Internet' which allows employees secure access, often behind
firewall technology, to corporate information systems, but with the
added advantages of external links to the Internet itself. The benefits
of access to vast information resources which are so characteristic of
the Internet can also be duplicated by the Intranet for distributing
internal company information. 'Information mining' has been a feature
of Internet for some time as the research potential of huge remote
databases has been realised.

This situation is mirrored in many corporations where not only current
information, but also archive or 'legacy' information stored often in
previously incompatible hardware and software systems needs to be made
widely accessible in-house. New Web applications can allow Intranets to
tie new applications and legacy resources into a seamless interface.
Why is this so important? The importance of such a system can be seen
from a number of viewpoints.

In an increasingly competitive environment any company which can plan
and manage its communications effectively, and where appropriate,
provide an interface with external customers and markets, will gain
maximum leverage from its information assets. In any corporate strategy
this internal communications benefit of an Intranet should be
considered as one of the first building blocks of any overall Internet
strategy, often before creating a public face using an external Web
site, which on its own may prove to be of dubious worth.

The type of information which can be manipulated in this way indicates
the real potential for companies to benefit from better use of their
own internal data, links with additional external data, and the
customisation of this information as required for either internal uses
or external purposes.

Information can vary from general company announcements where a company
may, for example, mount its corporate policy manuals as Web sites
rather than print lots of copies of the document for physical
distribution, to the provision of sales and performance data, personal
employee communications and highly secret management information.

The amount and range of information which can be accessed is great but
the ability to reduce this quickly and easily to relevant core data as
required, in a secure environment and at a fraction of the cost
previously associated with such an exercise, are the real reasons for
the interest in Intranets. An example of this application can be seen
in the recent announcement from Inmagic a leader in text-based
technology which has licensed spidering technology from Lycos to
deliver 'DB/Text Navigator Server', a new product that will allow
spidering, searching, indexing and cataloguing of corporate Intranets.

This will include the integration of Lycos' Web spiders with InMagic's
'DB/Text WebServer' to provide a powerful search and publishing engine.
Harnessing this technology, a corporate Intranet user will be able to
structure indexes and search processes for all users across the whole
information resources of the company. IBM is also using the Intranet
focus as part of its repositioning in this marketplace, and as a major
plank in gaining ground lost over the past ten years to major
competitors like Microsoft. New links announced by the IBM Global
Network service to provide Lotus Notes for use in Intranets as well as
public networks are an example of this and will form part of a more
detailed feature on IBM in a later issue of Internet for Business.

Flexibility at a low cost

The open standards that form the basis of Intranet technology allow
companies a great deal of flexibility when adapting their own
communications strategy without the historic need to consider costly
options for matching the current software and hardware they use.
Together with an ever-growing acceptance by employees of the benefits
of using hypertext links to locate information and the relatively cheap
cost of purchase, the advantages begin to mount up. An ability to
record better productivity levels while achieving cost reductions is a
powerful incentive for companies to look carefully at the adoption of
Intranets.

While these reasons alone would be sufficient to persuade many
managers, the advantages become even greater when management and
employees link into external communications streams either
asynchronously or in realtime with suppliers and customers or perhaps
sales personnel at geographically remote locations and across different
time zones. Internet for Business will continue to explore the theme of
Intranets in forthcoming issues. Wherever possible examples of best
practice will be highlighted, offering readers greater insight into the
practical benefits and organisational implications of adopting Intranet
methods.

YAHOO FLOATS HIGH ON STOCKMARKET

The well-known Internet service company run by chief Yahoo Jerry Wang
went public in April with what seems an almost inevitable clamour for
shares by all those expecting to make a killing from dealing in high
profile Internet companies.

A total of 2.6 million shares started at $13 on NASDAQ before soaring
to over $40 in one of the largest ever first day gains, according to
industry sources. As with many Internet companies (e.g. Netscape or
Easynet in the UK) the share price exceeded expectations for a company
with only just over one year's trading to its name and a loss making
revenue of under $1.4m. The result of all this activity was a market
capitalisation of over $1bn.

Yahoo is primarily an Internet-based search engine and directory
service for a medium which is notoriously large, unstable and therefore
difficult to quantify and record accurately. It has since been imitated
by several other products and recently lost its premier place in the
Netscape Web site as other competitors began eating into its market.
This competition together with an unknown potential to gain advertising
revenue has not deterred visitors who seem more impressed by the six
million hits per day which the service claims.

LYCOS RECORDS GROWTH IN VIEWING FIGURES

While much media attention has recently been given to the Yahoo
flotation, another company operating a search tool, Lycos, has also
been registering some strong gains.

Incorporated in June 1995, and with a market capitalisation of around
$250m this company has according to its president and CEO Robert Davis,
recently recorded up 4.5 million viewings per day from a figure of 6.5
million per month in mid-1995. The site now claims to have 100 separate
organisations advertising on it including Visa, Mastercard, Disney and
Hilton Hotels.

Advertising rates are levied on either a subject or general basis and
charges vary from $20,000 per million viewings to $50,000 per million
viewings.

Lycos, which now licenses its search software to 18 companies including
AT&T and Microsoft, has according to Davis, revenues growing from $215m
in the first quarter of its current financial year to $825m in the
second quarter ending 31 January 1996. Its agreement to license
spidering technology to companies like InMagic for the burgeoning
Intranet market should see continued growth figures.

DATA TRANSMISSION, DATA COMPRESSION AND THE WEB

This article provides an explanation of some of the factors involved in
causing slow response times on the Internet and explores the technology
of data compression, which is perhaps the most promising avenue of
development in resolving these difficulties.

One of the thornier practical issues facing any organisation wishing to
distribute information over the Internet is the question of data
transmission rates. All too often, when trying to view a Web site,
information passes across the Internet so slowly that a page may take
several minutes to take shape on the user's monitor screen. This is
especially true where large quantities of graphical or textual
information have been built into the site being viewed, because of the
extra time taken to download this heavy content over the Internet.

When designing a Web site, a clear conflict exists between the wish to
provide complex, visually appealing information and the need to create
Web structures which will transmit across the Internet, page-by-page,
in acceptable time periods. The results of these conflicts are clear to
see across the Web. A year ago many Web sites boasted substantial,
graphically complex home pages, often with well over 200 kilobytes of
information. This graphically-rich approach was then carried through
the presentation of the whole site. By contrast, in second quarter
1996, most well-informed Web producers have cut back on the graphical
content of sites, using smaller graphical images to enhance the appeal
of Web pages without making them the fundamental building blocks of the
information. The perceived problems in this area are so severe that
many players are waiting to see what technical solutions may evolve,
before committing themselves to large scale online publishing activity
across the Internet.

Limitations on data transmission rates

It is often assumed that the speed with which data can be retrieved
across the Internet is basically tied to the speed of the access
available to the individual user. Thus the expectation is that a dial-
up user with a 9,600 bps (bit per second) modem will always find data
transfer vastly slower than someone using a state-of-the-art 28.8kbps
(28,800 bits per second) modem. Corporate users with 64kbps ISDN
connections, or Mbps leased line connections are seen as still better
off.

This is true to a certain extent. The average data transmission rate
achieved in a given Internet transaction will generally be partly
dependent on the speed of the final access stage. However, other
factors come into play. Because the Internet works by sharing the
available data transmission bandwidth (total amount of data
transmissable between two points over a given time) between all the
transactions occurring between any two points, the speed of
transmission achieved by any single transaction is dependent on the
weight of traffic competing for the same route.

Additionally, one must also take account of the loading on the server
(source-end computer) which is providing the information to be
retrieved. The busier the server, the slower its response to any given
request.

Add all these factors together and one can see some fairly surprising
results. So, for example, if a UK modem dial-up Internet user retrieves
a 10MB file from a server in the US, it would be quite common for the
average data transmission rate achieved across the whole transaction to
be only in the region of 1 to 1.5 kbps. This is well below the
theoretical transmission capability of the current state-of-the-art
modem, and would result in a total file transfer time in the order of
hours rather than seconds.

The major benefit of faster access is that when the rest of the system
does speed up, the faster device can achieve faster transient data
rates. This in turn achieves a higher average data transmission rate
over the course of one large transaction, or many smaller ones,
improving the overall efficiency of the system.

Data compression techniques

The data transmission efficiency of the Internet, and the Web in
particular, is dependent on a whole host of factors beyond the sheer
speed of connection operated by an individual user. Since this is true,
and as data transmission can be a tediously slow process over the
global networks, measures must be sought elsewhere which can increase
the overall efficiency of the system and individual transactions. High
on the list of technologies which may be adopted to this end is the
technique of data compression.

Most personal computer users will by now have encountered data
compression in some form. Utilities such as PKZIP or WINZIP have become
widely used in compressing software and textual information, so that
they may be transported more efficiently on disk, and many software
packages now require a fairly lengthy de-compression stage during their
first installation on a given computer. Such compression/de-compression
techniques can equally be applied to graphics files, which take up such
a large proportion of the time taken in retrieving Web pages from the
servers on which Web sites are mounted.

The benefits of using data compression in preparing information for
mounting on the Web are manifold, with gains across the whole Internet.
The Web now generates a substantial proportion of all Internet data
traffic. Any steps to reduce the file sizes, and thus the data
congestion across the system in total, make the whole experience of
Internet use more rewarding and more efficient. Equally, for an
individual organisation mounting a Web site, its users will be
generally far more comfortable in using the site when retrieving
compressed data.

Some commonly available compression technologies have the ability to
reduce graphics files down to between a tenth and a twentieth of their
original size, without perceptible loss of quality on screen when the
files are retrieved. Going back to our hypothetical 10MB file, this
would mean that the retrieval time involved in calling the file across
the Internet at our average data rate of 1.2kbps would be reduced to
minutes. Of course there is a small lag introduced because the client
computer receiving the compressed file has then to de-compress it,
which is a finite process. However, the de-compression period is
usually significantly less than the time saved in transmitting the file
across the Internet, meaning that all sides obtain benefit from the use
of compression.

Compression standards on the Internet

Of course there is one major rider to consider. Most compression
techniques require the attendant de-compression utility to be available
to the end-user. This is certainly true of the majority of graphics
compression techniques which may be applied to images for the Web. This
means that a Web site developer must either find the means to provide
each user of the site with the de-compression software for the
particular compression technique employed, or that a compression
technology must be selected which is already widely used across the
Internet.

Until recently, the Internet had adopted as a de facto standard for
graphic image file compression a technology known as the graphics
interchange format (GIF). So prevalent was the use of this technique
that the term GIF had become almost synonymous with the term graphical
image among Web users. GIF is a fairly straightforward compression
technique, designed specifically for use with network systems and for
the realtime transfer of graphics files. Its original developer was the
CompuServe commercial network service, and from there it spread widely
across the Internet. Most Web browser software utilities, up to the
present time, include a GIF reader to provide their standard image
processing capability.

But this useful and almost ubiquitous technology has come under threat,
because the core compression technology employed is under patents held
by its original developers, the Unisys company in the US. Unisys took
steps in late 1994 to enforce its patents, which in turn obliged
CompuServe to put in place a licensing system, requiring any new
software developer using GIF processes to pay royalties on their
application. The response of the Web community, and Internet software
developers, has been to work up a new compression standard, which is
seen as a full replacement for the GIF technology. This new compression
standard is known as the portable network graphic (PNG, pronounced
'ping'). The development of PNG has been undertaken by an international
group of developers under the wing of the World Wide Web Consortium,
W3C, based at MIT. W3C is the nearest thing there is to an overriding
authority controlling the protocols, standards and development of the
World Wide Web, although it has no formal powers.

PNG is still under development, but though still less prevalent than
GIF, is fairly commonly used by Web sites.

The three most commonly available graphics compression techniques on
the Internet are as follows:

- GIF - the Graphics Interchange Format developed by CompuServe;

- PNG - Portable Network Graphics format;

- JPEG - a graphics compression standard developed by an international
standards committee known as the Joint Photographic Experts Group
(universally known as 'Jaypeg'). JPEG techniques are now available as a
built-in feature of the Netscape Navigator Web browser, and are
becoming increasingly common as a means of reproducing graphical images
for Web applications.

Before going into any detailed comparison of these methodologies, it is
necessary briefly to explain the difference between 'lossless' and
'lossy' compression techniques. Lossless compression (as in GIF and PNG
methods) essentially defines the full image when it is compressed, in
such a way that repeated cycles of compression and de-compression
produce an identical image each time.

In lossy compression, the essential concept is that, for reproduction
on a computer screen, or using a colour printer, the amount of detail
available in any given electronic image file is actually greater than
the human eye can resolve. Techniques have been developed such that
information can be discarded during compression, and still leave the
image of a sufficient quality to appear identical to human vision, when
it is de-compressed. Detailed pixel-by-pixel (a pixel being the
smallest indivisible element in the image) analysis would reveal that
some of the pixels in the image have been changed, typically by some
form of averaging process, so that the detailed definition of the image
is significantly reduced by such compression/de-compression methods.
The benefit of this approach (as used by JPEG) is that substantially
higher compression ratios may be obtained from the same original data,
by comparison with lossless compression. However, repeated cycles of
compression and de-compression will result in substantial deterioration
of the image quality.

Features desirable in image handling

In presenting images on the Web, and allowing them to be downloaded by
Web users, a certain number of features are sought from the software
employed:

1. Streamability - the technique employed should allow for the image to
be transmitted serially (that is bit-by-bit) across a network;

2. Progressive display - the image being retrieved by the client
browser software is progressively built up on the monitor screen,
either section-by-section, or as a progressively more detailed picture
across the whole area of the image;

3. Transparency - the ability to define one colour within the original
image, or some defined portion of the image, as transparent. This
enables the image to be placed against a background of differing colour
in such a way that the background colour replaces the desired portion
of the original image;

4. The ability to store ancillary information, such as non-printing
text, within the data structure of the compressed file;

5. Hardware and software independent operation;

6. Lossless compression, for preference, since many applications of
graphics transfer over computer networks may require images to be open
to examination by computer systems, rather than just by the naked eye,
or to be employed in processes such as print origination;

7. The ability to handle colour palettes employed in typical personal
computer monitor and software systems, such as the 256 colour palette
devised for early versions of Windows.

Both GIF and PNG standards offer all these features, but PNG has a
number of other advantages.

It also handles truecolour images - those which employ a colour-
blending process to generate the areas of each colour across the image,
rather than a defined colour palette, and a more sophisticated
grayscale process.

It offers a system called the alpha channel, allowing transparency to
be defined across the full image, rather than for a particular single
colour from a palette, or particular part of the image. And gamma
correction is provided, allowing the image intensity to be adjusted
according to the likely application to which the image will be devoted.
More sophisticated error correction techniques are also found in PNG as
is faster building of initial elements in the progressive display of
the image across network links. Unlike GIF, PNG is now designed to be
an open standard without legal obligation to pay royalties or licence
fees to its developers.

By comparison, JPEG is not designed to offer the same spread of
functionality as either the GIF or PNG standards. The compression
technique devised for the JPEG standard was seen as providing a first-
rate means of processing truecolour photographic material, and complex
hand-drawn artwork, along with more complex, naturalistic halftone
images. JPEG is not well adapted for use with text, simple line art
drawings or any other simple outline material.

When used with the type of image for which it was designed, however,
JPEG compression is a very effective tool, achieving compression ratios
of up to 20:1, with no perceptible loss of quality when the image is de-
compressed for on-screen viewing. Use of GIF on the same image would
obtain something in the region of 3:1 compression, or perhaps a little
better. With an image containing constant variations in colour, JPEG
would also produce a more realistic image on de-compression, whereas a
GIF de-compressed may show noticeable banding effects through its
failure to define colour change graduations adequately. JPEG has
another benefit, in that it is possible, in compressing an image for
presentation as part of a Web site, for example, to offset the quality
required in the application against the degree of compression applied.
Thus, if only a very low resolution is required in the final image, on
screen, compression ratios of up to 100:1 are available. If very high
resolution is required, by contrast, then compression may be limited to
much lower ratios. This helps to make JPEG a very flexible tool for the
Web developer.

The major downfall of JPEG on the Internet is that it is much less
widely-integrated into the software utilities, such as Web browsers,
which are used to 'unpack' images from their servers on the system.
Many highly effective JPEG viewers and utilities are available, even in
the freeware domain. However, other than Netscape and a few others,
most of the fundamental Internet tools require such JPEG viewers to be
configured separately, making the standard rather more clumsy for the
average Web or Internet user than GIF.

It should be borne in mind, however, that this position is not likely
to be static. There is increasing pressure within the Internet
community to greatly enhance the ability of the Internet to handle
transfers of graphical, audio and video information, and the more
advanced compression techniques are likely to be increasingly adopted
as part of the means to achieve this.

The future of online image handling

All the techniques described so far essentially employ similar
mathematical processes to achieve their compression effects. These rely
on re-defining the image, pixel-by-pixel, so as to reduce the amount of
data required to construct the image on screen on de-compression. Since
early 1996, a company called Iterated Systems has been making a wholly-
different compression/de-compression technology available to Internet
users. This may offer significant benefits in performance in comparison
with currently popular techniques, with the added advantage that
essentially the same technology can be adapted to process audio and
video data streams.

Iterated Systems, founded in 1987, has developed a compression
technology based in the use of advanced mathematical processes known as
fractal transforms. Data is compressed by identifying such formulae to
define recurring elements in the image, so that large areas of
repeating data can be replaced with the fractal definition, together
with codes to define position, colour, intensity and other necessary
parameters. Iterated is so confident of the quality of its technology
that it has publicly stated the goal of making its system the de facto
standard on the Internet, and in any other TCP/IP network systems, such
as corporate internal information networks (Intranets).

Fractal compression has already been widely adopted as a means of
efficient image storage and retrieval in CD-ROM applications. Among the
users in this environment have been Microsoft, in handling the 7,000
images in its Encarta encyclopedia along with other multimedia
encyclopedia developers such as Hutchinson and Grolier.

A typical fractal compression process would reduce a 2MB file to a
compressed form of about 40kB in size, representing a compression ratio
of approximately 50:1. According to Iterated, this would be comparable
in quality on de-compression with a JPEG file produced with a far lower
compression ratio. Hence the fractal technique potentially offers far
greater data transmission benefits and efficiency benefits, while
offering at least equivalent image quality to other methods, and some
interesting additional features.

By contrast with GIF and PNG, fractal image files (FIFs) load
differently when retrieved over a network. Instead of gradually
appearing in increasingly higher definition across the whole ultimate
area of the image, a FIF will appear first as a thumbnail-sized version
of the full image, at full definition, clearly showing the nature of
the image from the start. It will then gradually expand up to the full
size defined by the creator of the Web page. Additionally the file,
once retrieved, can be handled in a more versatile manner than de-
compressed files from other technologies. It is possible, for example,
to zoom into given areas of a FIF at much higher ratios than is
possible with a comparable JPEG image, without the blocky quality
introduced by the pixel-to-pixel boundaries in conventional images. It
is also readily possible to vary the colour depth of the image both
upwards and downwards after retrieval.

Iterated Systems has released as freeware a utility called Fractal
Viewer, which can be downloaded free of charge from its Web site. This
allows users to retrieve and de-compress FIFs from the Internet.
Fractal Viewer can be added as a plug-in to Netscape Navigator, the
popular Web browser, so that Netscape is able to retrieve FIFs
seamlessly from Web sites. At the same time the company has made
available a utility called CoolFusion, which handles video and audio
material in a similar fashion. This is also freeware and also able to
be integrated with the Netscape Navigator. For developers, an image
processing tool called Fractal Image is available commercially, along
with a shareware developers' kit.

CoolFusion is perhaps the most exciting of these tools. At present it
is not possible to comment on its effectiveness, since Iterated has yet
to release any fractal-compressed video material for evaluation.
However, if the levels of data compression predicted can be achieved,
then the technology of realtime video transmission over the Internet
may be brought a large step forward. Iterated's people currently talk
in terms of achieving realtime colour video transmission at data
transmission rates suitable for modem transmission. This currently
remains well beyond the scope of the most widely-used video compression
tools on the market - either MPEG (for Motion Picture Experts Group), a
distant cousin of JPEG, or Apple's QuickTime technology.

A key tool for the future of the Web

Until such a time as the whole Internet can guarantee data rates in the
64kbps range for every individual transaction, at least for Web
applications, compression technology offers the most promising route
for development of advanced data delivery systems such as sophisticated
graphics, voice telephony and full-motion video in realtime. Since the
timescale for the achievement of widespread high-bandwidth connectivity
is probably in years rather than months, it can be seen that any
organisation looking to be involved in sophisticated Web information
distribution should be fully conversant with the most appropriate
compression technologies available for its purposes. This article has
set out some of the current techniques, and pointed to one promising
area of development. It is likely that Internet for Business will
return to this theme frequently in future issues.

HOME OR AWAY - THE WEB SITE DILEMMA

A crucial decision facing any organisation planning to establish its
own information service, or site, on the World Wide Web is whether or
not to invest in the equipment, software and human resources necessary
to manage such a system in-house. The alternative, of placing the site
on a remote server, managed by a hosting service, may appear at first
sight to have disadvantages in loss of control, and to require payments
which have no capital benefit to the site developer. However, on closer
scrutiny, the matter is not so straightforward.

The costs involved in setting up a Web site on an in-house, managed
basis are likely to be in the order of #10,000 to #15,000 for hardware
and software alone, even at the entry level. To this must be added the
necessary Internet access, rental of which from a service provider will
be in a similar order to the hardware and software costs, in the first
year of operation.

If a full-time Web site operator is employed (traditionally known
somewhat onesidedly as a Webmaster), then a further outgoing in excess
of #20,000 per year should be envisaged. This leaves aside any question
of investing in security or firewall software, to protect the site from
unauthorised intrusion or attempts to use it as a means to break into
the organisation's network, if any.

In return for such investment, a Web site publisher will gain total
control over the site, including its efficiency of operation and
maintenance, the regularity of updating, and the types of access
allowed to one or more different categories of user. If the site is
connected to the internal LAN it will also be possible to use it as the
server for an Intranet, an information service for the organisation's
staff, using World Wide Web software and interfaces.

Hosting a Web site

However, the level of investment indicated above may seem a large jump
for any organisation, particularly among small businesses, if coming to
the Internet or Web for the first time. The alternative, which has
become increasingly popular in recent times, is to establish a Web
site, but to have it hosted on a remote computer, managed by, and
installed at the premises of a service company.

In this case, the owner of the site can still take direct control of
the appearance, content and functionality of the Web site, even
downloading updated direct on to the server by using a remote Internet
connection. However, the hosting organisation will take responsibility
for the Internet access required by the site, monitoring and
maintaining the function of the site, backing up its contents and
supervising the hardware. Equally, they will incur the capital costs
for the equipment and services needed.

The costs involved in this process are often extremely reasonable. A
typical service of this nature in the UK is offered by Cambridge-based
Internet systems integrators, Electric Mail. This company offers two
levels of Web hosting service, WebSpace and WebSpace Light. WebSpace is
the top-level service, offering users the ability to operate a Web site
on Electric Mail's servers, with its own discrete address (known in the
Internet field as a URL - Uniform Resource Locator). The basis charges
for this service would amount to approximately #1,000 over the first
year of operation, and somewhat less per year thereafter. WebSpace
Light, which registers an organisation's Web site as a sub-section
(known as sub-domain) of Electric Mail's own Web site, is available for
less than #200 per year.

Hosting in the UK and abroad

Most of the UK's leading Internet service providers will offer similar
hosting services, among them companies such as Unipalm Pipex and
PSINet. Similarly the same services are often available from Web
production companies such as London-based Webmedia. An identical
picture is seen, for example, in the US, where leading service
providers Netcom and UUNet offer identical or similar services. Very
often the detailed arrangements for Web site hosting are published by
these companies on their own Web sites, including scales of charges
levied.

The cost/benefit equation in establishing a Web site may well be tipped
heavily towards the outsourcing option, especially for smaller
companies or those embarking on experimental use of the Web. In-house
operation really only makes sense if a major site is contemplated,
fully-integrated with other information services operated by an
organisation, and requiring constant updating and supervision from the
organisation's own staff.

Web hosting services are readily available in the UK and the US, and
this is equally true across all the countries where commercial Internet
activity is gaining acceptance. Anyone contemplating creating a Web
site, whether commercially-orientated or otherwise, is well-advised to
give this option serious thought.

INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS - THE INTERNET LEAP FORWARD

Out of the many disparate strands which are slowly emerging from the
commercial development and harnessing of the Internet, two levels of
practical and creative thinking may be isolated. One is the tendency
simply to take existing methods of communication and presentation of
information from media such as television and the printed word, and to
transfer them with little adjustment into Internet contexts such as the
Web.

Meanwhile more imaginative and possibly more risk-oriented developers
and implementers search for new information models which operate to
obtain the maximum return from the particular strengths of the Internet
medium. The momentum towards this latter approach is slowly building,
and numbers of companies are developing software which takes this style
away from a few informed insiders and into the field of systematic
application of available tools.

In truth the differentiation between the more conservative application
of traditional media approaches, and the exploration of new
communications paradigms, is rather to be seen as a spectrum between
two extremes, and not as a pair of incompatible options. Some
traditional media techniques work effectively over the Internet, after
all. However, as with the evolution of television or radio
broadcasting, the development of commercial communications over the
Web, for example, will assuredly tend towards new models which are most
effective in harnessing the medium. Insiders generally feel that this
process will take place far more rapidly than has been the case in
previous generations of media.

What then are the strengths identifiable for the Web, which perhaps
best exemplifies the Internet as a tool for interactive communications
between groups and individuals with commercial goals in view? It would
be rash to attempt to create an exhaustive list at this early stage in
the growth of the medium. However, a number of elements are already
clear:

1. Flexibility - one Web site, with suitable control over categories of
access, can serve a range of different audiences, such as company
staff, shareholders, customers, collaborators, distributors, the press,
government and official regulators and many more;

2. Adaptability - information on a Web site is open to frequent update
and focusing at relatively low cost, by comparison with traditional
methods such as printing.

3. Interactivity - properly configured, a Web site can allow a truly
balanced, two-way communication process, whereby various audiences can
receive messages from the site owner and respond with similar force and
precision. It is also possible to allow mutual interaction between the
various audiences which the site may address - between customers and
distributors, for example;

4. Immediacy - information can be uniquely tailored to the needs of
very narrowly-focused groups, and updated to match their changing
responses.

Up to second quarter 1996, many organisations which have launched Web
sites have failed to go beyond the creation of electronic billboards.
Information presented is essentially sales driven, relatively static
and offers little opportunity for users of sites to communicate or
interact. Web users in general tend not to respond positively to such
ponderous content, preferring to spend their time in surfing sites
which are far more active, interactive and fast-moving.

Some of the tools which allow companies to build such interest into Web
sites include:

1. Database interfacing software - allowing site visitors to search
company information relevant to their needs, and access the search
results through their own Web browser interface. These tools create
HTML pages dynamically according to the search results for the user,
meaning that the underlying database may be left in its natural
database environment, rather than being converted into HTML in total.

2. Intelligent agents - utilities which allow users to specify, once
and for all or on an ever-changing basis, a range of information types
from within a site's resources which are particularly relevant to their
interests or needs. The agent then delivers the relevant information as
a selection from the total content of the site (an interesting current
example is the Personal Times, the interactive version of The Times of
London, where users may define an information profile to confirm the
material from the overall structure of the newspaper which they wish to
see each day.)

3. Online forms - tools structured into the HTML mark-up of Web pages
to allow users to send information back to the Web site owner for
future reference.

4. Interactive offline discussion groups and online chat groups.
Increasingly used in sites relating to consumer marketing, especially,
these services allow communication, with or without some form of
moderation by the site owner, between users of the site, whether within
a particular group, such as current customers, or across groups, so
that, for example, customers are able to communicate with distributors,
retailers, or other groups using the site.

5. Online ordering and payment structures - the basic building blocks
of genuine online commerce.

6. Multimedia data-delivery software - allowing the presentation of
information through a Web site in audio, video and 3D forms.

Web communications defined

One of the terms heard with increasing frequency in this field of Web
communications is the word 'Pointcasting'. The major strength of
established media such as newspapers, radio and television has been
broadcasting, the distribution of one fixed message, or a small range
of fixed alternatives, to a large audience with defined commonalities
of interests. The Web moves away from this model to give the marketing
or corporate communications strategist a whole new toolkit.
Pointcasting is seen as the process of establishing messages which are
valid to individuals or small discrete interest groups of relevance to
the site owner, and the updating of these messages to continue their
relevance to those targets over time. Pointcasting relies on the
harnessing of tools such as those outlined in the previous paragraph,
to ensure that two-way communication is established between a Web site
creator and the individual users, at a constantly relevant and fruitful
level.

One company which has begun to create software applications which are
designed to address this technique in a simple, managed software
environment, is Silicon Valley start up BroadVision. Preferring to use
the term one-to-one marketing, rather than pointcasting, since its
offering focuses in the business development side of these new Web
techniques, BroadVision has launched a suite of software which will
underpin the development of these focused, interactive techniques in
the commercial Web environment. Called Broad-Vision One-to-One (tm),
this is a software system which is designed to manage the entire
marketing and selling life cycle on the Web. Four areas of
functionality are offered;

1. Community - the provision of dynamic information relevant to users,
not always focused directly on the site owners' products and services.
Interactive communication between users of the site is also delivered,
where appropriate. This aspect of the software is designed to build a
community of users, and deliver intrinsic benefits to them within the
structure of the site, encouraging their repeated use of the
information.

2. Profiling - data tracking utilities which allow the site owner to
form detailed knowledge of each individual relevant to the products and
services dealt with by the site. This will, for example, remember all
the transactions entered into by a given user, giving the site owner
useful profile details for design of further interaction with that
user.

3. Targeting - intelligent-agent style functions, allowing the sites
content to be delivered to individual users in a fashion which best
serves their short-term and long-term needs.

4. Transaction processing - electronic ordering and sales, customer
services, EDI, reporting etc.

This methodology bears comparison with traditional direct sales
techniques. Leading exponents of catalogue selling, for example, have
long improved their sales performance by maintaining extensive database
information regarding the tastes and buying habits of customers.
However, the Web is more powerful still, since it allows the marketing
professional to interact more frequently with a wider range of
audiences, and to develop a more detailed understanding of the needs
and wants of the individuals and companies' which buy their goods and
services.

Software such as that provided by BroadVision, which is one of a number
of providers in this field, allows non-technical staff of companies
seeking to harness Internet marketing techniques to have direct control
of the strategy and information content of the process. Such tools
promise to have a similar revolutionary effect in the Internet field as
did desktop publishing software in the print-on-paper communications
process. Once they are well-established, the whole process of marketing
on the Internet should be moved up a notch in terms of accessibility
and effectiveness.

SMALL BUSINESSES RELUCTANT TO JOIN WEB

O'Reilly Associates have published the results of their recent survey
Conducting business on the Internet. The full results are available for
purchase by contacting their Web site at www.ora.com.

The companies surveyed were drawn from the Dun and Bradstreet database
and divided into large, medium and small organisations. The response
rates upon which the results were collected were 410, 406 and 214
respectively. Large companies were classified as those with more than
1,000 employees, medium-sized companies with 101 to 1,000 employees and
small companies with less than 100 employees.

While the results indicated that 51% of large companies in North
America currently use the Internet, only 8% of small companies take
advantage of the network, and while a surprising 28% of large companies
plan no Internet access in the near future, this figure rises to 53%
for medium-sized and 79% for small companies.

Intranet activity was also monitored with 37% of large companies having
at least one internal Web site while external Web site activity was
registered with 35% of large companies.

PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB

Latest figures from two of the world's leading research groups in the
high technology sector shed further light on the development of the
Web, and on the use of software designed to support access and
searching across this global data structure. Data released reveals the
continuing explosive growth of the Web as a means of publishing and
accessing data, and identifies clear winners and losers, up to the
present date, in the battle for dominance in software development for
Web browsers.

According to figures published by the International Data Corporation,
the total number of users of the Web, across all sectors, will reach
some 30 million or more during 1996 up from under 10 million in 1995.
These numbers are projected to reach well in excess of 120 million by
the close of the decade. In parallel with this growth, a shift in the
balance of the Web is forecast by IDC, with the percentage of Web users
worldwide being located in the US falling from nearly 80% in 1995 to
little over 50% at the end of 1999.

IDC's fellow research group Dataquest took advantage of the opportunity
provided by the Internet World show to announce a new service providing
market insights over the Internet delivered through the World Wide Web.
The service, entitled DQi (Dataquest Interactive), will offer high-
value quantitative analysis and news on the IT industry (the site
address is: http://www.dataquest.com). Of special interest to Internet
industry analysts during the Internet World event was a new breakdown,
published by DQi, of the use of various types of Web browser software
across the Internet sector. Statistics compiled by Dataquest were
obtained by monitoring the traffic on a wide range of Web sites which
publish statistics on numbers of accesses and the type of browser used
by each visitor to the site.

Using this basis for statistical analysis, Dataquest concludes that the
Netscape Navigator Web browser, in all its versions, remains the most
popular among Web users, with some 84% of all Web traffic being
generated by this browser. Netscape's nearest competitor in the Web
browser market is now the Microsoft Internet Explorer, which has just
7% of this market, although its user base is among the fastest growing
of all the Netscape alternatives. Other browsers listed include the
proprietary browser of America Online, with 3% of the market, and NCSA
Mosaic, the original graphical Web browser, whose various versions take
1% of the market. The remaining competitors take a further 5% between
them. Among this latter group, and with the highest growth rate of all,
is the Sun Microsystems Hot Java browser, developed to feature Sun's
Java online interactive programming environment.

Dataquest will continue to track the browser competition, and many
other measures of the Internet and computing sector, publishing regular
updates on the Web site launched at Internet World.

VIDEO NETWORKING TAKES A STEP FORWARD

General Instrument Corporation, a technology integrator for interactive
voice, video and data delivery over computer networks, announced a new
initiative in video-enriched interactive services in early May. GI, a
US-based multinational, is launching a programme known as Videoware
Innovation Partners, to establish key collaborations with other players
in the networking field for the delivery of its Videoware video-rich
data service over broadband networks. The GI system, in collaboration
with its VI Partners, will allow network operators to deploy a high-
speed turnkey system integrating hardware, network management, Internet
and intranet access and multimedia services.

Initially GI is concentrating on delivering services over its
proprietary SURFboard network, an end-to-end system delivering video
and data at 27Mbps to PCs equipped with its SURFboard adaptor cards.
This network structure depends on cable outward links, with a standard
telephone return path. Hence the return data feed operates at
narrowband data rates only. Nonetheless, the company's solution is one
which may be implemented immediately, over existing cable networks. GI
plans to launch a two-way broadband system, harnessing Asynchronous
Transfer Mode switching, based on the use of existing cable
infrastructure for both outward and return information.

Partners in the Videoware Innovation programme include America Online,
CompuServe, Dorling Kindersley Multimedia, Macromedia, Paramount
Pictures, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Turner Broadcasting
System.
