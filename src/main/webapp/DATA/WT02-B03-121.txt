<H2>The Cure and Prevention of Diabetes</H2>

Institute</B> </P>

<P>In order to simplify the discussion of diabetes, we will
divide the subject into two sections: Juvenile Diabetes and
Age Onset Diabetes. Due to its causes, age onset diabetes is
relatively simple and easy to overcome with the Gerson
Therapy. It has been shown that many patients with age onset
diabetes actually produce adequate amounts of insulin, as is
evidenced in their blood. Yet they are not able to properly
assimilate and burn sugar at the cellular level to produce
energy. Instead, diabetics often excrete sugar in the urine,
are thirsty and drink excessive amounts of water, and lack
energy. Since these patients have insulin in their blood, why
are they diabetic? The problem is that the available insulin
in the bloodstream is not being used by the body to
metabolize the sugar. In order to perform its function,
insulin must enter the individual cell and reach the cell's
insulin receptors. In diabetics, insulin receptors are
blocked or clogged with cholesterol, so the insulin is unable
to do its job. So age-onset diabetes is really a cholesterol
problem, not one of sugar, or even malfunction of the
pancreas (which produces insulin in the Islets of
Langerhans). </P>
<P>Since no animal products are used, the Gerson Therapy is
totally devoid of cholesterol. At the <A href="center.html">
hospital</A> facility where the Gerson Therapy is
administered, we have seen blood cholesterol levels drop
dramatically, in some patients, up to 100 points in just one
week on the therapy without cholesterol-reducing drugs. If
the uptake of insulin is blocked by cholesterol, then it
could be expected that this dramatic reduction in serum
cholesterol levels would result in an almost immediate
reduction of the requirement for insulin supplementation. In
fact, it does. One patient, who also suffered from
metastasized melanoma in the liver, had a fasting blood sugar
level of 177 on entering the <A href="center.html">
Gerson hospital</A> (the normal level is 120 or below). In
two days, this level dropped to 120 - without insulin. In one
particularly dramatic case, we saw a diabetic patient, age
46, with sugar levels in his bloodstream of over 200, that
were uncontrollable with insulin and drugs. This problem
completely cleared in five weeks. At that time, he was able
to take all the juices of the full Gerson Therapy (carrot
juices contain large amounts of complex carbohydrates)
without any further need of insulin. His blood sugar level
returned to a normal 120, and remained stable. </P>
<H2>Juvenile Diabetes</H2>
<P>Juvenile diabetes presents entirely different problems.
In juvenile diabetes, as opposed to age-onset diabetes, we
are dealing with true insulin deficiency, damage to the
Islets of Langerhans (the gland clusters in the pancreas that
produce insulin). According to an article some years ago, in
Scientific American, juvenile diabetes is most commonly
diagnosed in children after a severe, long lasting 'flu' that
doesn't seem to yield to normal treatment. This, it turns
out, was not a flu, but pancreatitis; an infection and
inflammation of the pancreas, resulting in damage to the
Islets of Langerhans, and the subsequent diabetes. A few days
ago, I had a call from a distraught parent who is trying to
deal with two children, girls aged 6 and 10, both afflicted
with juvenile diabetes. He did not comprehend the true cause
of his children's disease and the progression of their
problems, starting in early infancy, that led to diabetes. I
have talked to many parents and can usually reconstruct what
happened. The children are immune deficient from birth. This
deficiency is aggravated by immunizations, but it is also
due, in large part, to the mother's poor nutrition, one
lacking in essential nutrients. </P>
<P>These already deficient babies are generally not
breast-fed, but instead receive artificial canned, jarred,
and processed milk and baby foods. The resulting lack of
nutrients adds to the original immune deficiency, and
manifests as a progression of infections, colds and flu. The
child is now plied with drugs, including antibiotics and
various flu medicines. Drugs will temporarily suppress the
infections (in the above case, constant ear infections) but
will not strengthen the immune system. On the contrary, all
antibiotics are toxic to some extent and suppress the immune
system further. So the infections become more frequent and
more severe - until, one day, they become a full fledged
pancreatitis. Not long after that, the child is diagnosed
with juvenile diabetes. </P>
<P>We need to consider another point: the liver and the
pancreas, since they are such extremely important organs,
have their own immune systems, the reticulo-endothelial
system. If hepatitis or pancreatitis occurs, this alone
proves that the affected organ's immune system is severely
damaged. The weakening of the immune system is caused
partially by frequent doses of antibiotics and/or other
medical drugs - all of which are more or less liver toxic.
But once a child develops diabetes and begins taking insulin,
this does not overcome the immune weakness. On the contrary,
the infections continue and require more and more drug
suppression. Insulin does not produce healing! </P>
<P>For many people who have never dealt with the problem,
diabetes seems like a mild illness, easily overcome with
insulin injections. That is unfortunately not true. Juvenile
diabetes often results in kidney damage, with resulting need
for kidney dialysis. Many of the children afflicted with this
disease, as they go into early adulthood, are subject to
retinal damage which can result in blindness. Young adults
whose kidneys no longer function require kidney dialysis and
eventually kidney transplants - which are only good for a few
years and then fail with deplorable results. </P>
<P>In age-onset diabetics, the doctor's suggestion to avoid
starches and sugars and eat more proteins produces other
serious problems. As we have seen above, this disease is
largely due to excess cholesterol. But the recommendation of
&quot;a high protein diet&quot; is understood by most
patients to mean that they should eat largely animal
products. Meat, chicken, fish, cheese, eggs and milk are very
high in cholesterol, the very cause of the problem. The
result for most of these patients is that more serious
cholesterol problems develop: deposits in the arteries
leading to high blood pressure, heart disease and heart
attacks; poor circulation with resulting gangrene. Gangrenous
toes, feet and legs often must be amputated. Retinal
detachment problems lead to blindness. </P>
<P>Most of the problem is the excess cholesterol as well as
excess animal protein that causes much of the overload on the
kidneys and their eventual failure. Few people realize that
diabetes is the third most frequent cause of death in the
United States (after cardiovascular disease and cancer) but
it is rather easy to overcome with the Gerson Therapy. Since
the Therapy deals easily and quickly with the cholesterol
overload, the patient's body becomes able to break down and
eliminate the arteriosclerosis, the kidney and eye problems,
as well as the overload on the heart. We have even seen
painful toes, already cold and white due to lack of
circulation from arteriosclerosis, turn warm and pink again
in a week or two on the Gerson Therapy. </P>
<P>Admittedly, it is much easier to deal with age-onset
diabetes, since it is mostly a cholesterol problem with the
resulting arteriosclerosis and kidney damage. When it comes
to juvenile diabetes, we must remember that we are dealing
with true pancreatic dysfunction with resultant poor insulin
production. We have seen some children with juvenile diabetes
improve eyesight, overcome high blood pressure and kidney
damage. But, since the Islets of Langerhans cannot be
restored to full function, these people have to stay close to
the Gerson Therapy for the rest of their lives. In children
and youngsters that is a tall order. On the other hand, we
have seen one patient, who started on the Gerson Therapy with
&quot;40% irreversible damage to his eyesight&quot; according
to his ophthalmologist, with high blood pressure that was
uncontrollable at over 220; with constant kidney pain and
severe edema - be cleared of all these problems using the
Gerson Therapy . But, after some time, at age 22, he was
tired of adhering to this strict diet and felt he could do
well enough without it. He went back to his former ways, the
standard American diet (SAD), and after a few years, went
blind, went on kidney dialysis and eventually died. </P>
<P>This terrible scenario is not only curable but
preventable. However, prevention is one of the most difficult
approaches to &quot;sell&quot; to the public. People usually
feel that, as long as they are well, nothing can happen to
them, and diseases are for other people. Also, they have a
strong resistance to changing their diet and lifestyle.
Prevention of juvenile diabetes starts with the mother. Even
prior to conception, her diet matters. The typical high fat,
high salt, and high protein American diet is unfortunately
not conducive to good health. The mother's diet should
consist largely of fresh (organic, whenever possible) fruit
and vegetables, raw salads and juices and a little non-fat
unsalted protein food, such as non-fat yogurt or cottage
cheese. Also stimulants and drugs should be omitted: coffee,
alcohol and especially cigarettes, not to speak of street or
physician-administered drugs, tranquilizers, sleeping pills
and pain killers. Please note: on a vegetarian, salt-free,
low animal protein diet, people will naturally be free of
pain, sleep well, have no colds and flu and require no drugs.
</P>
<P>The next area of prevention for the mother is, of course,
during her pregnancy. She again needs large amounts of fresh
fruit and vegetables, raw salads, etc. and fresh vegetable
juices. The usual admonition: &quot;take a lot of proteins,
drink plenty of milk&quot; is completely wrong and could even
be dangerous, as it tends to overload the kidneys and produce
toxemia. A properly nourished mother will have a baby strong
in immune response, free of infections and, if the baby is
breast fed, also free of colic. An easy, relatively painless
birth is an extra bonus. </P>
<P>One of the important preventive reasons why breast
feeding is so essential is the very first fluid which enters
the breast. This is not actual milk, but a transparent fluid,
called colostrum. It is nature's gift to this wonderful new
life and helps to build the baby's immune system, the
friendly bacteria in the intestinal tract, etc. It is
unfortunate that some pediatricians feel that they know
better than nature and tell mothers to discard this first
fluid &quot;since it is not milk&quot; and wait until the
&quot;real milk&quot; comes in before breast feeding is to
begin. </P>
<P>The next important preventive step, of course, is the
actual nutrition of the baby. If the baby is fed good, fresh
live foods, first mother's milk, then fresh vegetables,
mashed bananas, apples and fresh oatmeal rather than boxed
'Pablum' or other artificial cereals, the baby will remain
well with good defenses. One of the first additions to the
child's diet, as early as the second or third month, and even
before oatmeal, should be freshly pressed carrot juice, made
from organic carrots. As the child grows, one must keep items
such as ice cream, cookies, cakes, etc., to the barest
minimum, only for special occasions. In an earlier Healing
Newsletter (Vol. 9, No. 3), we published the devastating
effects on children of hot dogs and other spiced sausage
meats. It is also most important to avoid bottled soft
drinks, especially those containing stimulants, such as the
cola drinks. Again, fresh fruit and vegetable juices (carrot
and apple, for instance) are best. </P>
<H2>Adult Diabetes Prevention</H2>
<P>We now go on to the adult prevention program. Obviously,
since age-onset diabetes is caused largely by excess
cholesterol, we have to come to the same conclusions: a low
animal protein and low fat diet, no deep fried foods, minimum
salt and sweet bottled drinks as well as avoidance of
alcohol, cigarettes, and other stimulants. To keep the body's
defenses at a peak level, with high enzyme function, we must
again have the best, fresh, organic fruit and vegetables,
avoid salt, stimulants and drugs, but use fresh vegetable
juices with only occasional 'treats'. </P>
<P><A href="maxbio.html">
Dr. Gerson</A> wrote about prevention in his book <A
href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases </A>. He felt that a
diet consisting of 75% building and highly nutritious
material, and 25% of &quot;your choice&quot; would be
adequate. That was 40 years ago. In the intervening years,
technology has damaged the air, water, soil and foods much
more, with the predictable result that most people's
resistance is much lower. Therefore, I would propose a diet
of 90% building and defensive foods (fresh, organic fruit and
vegetables) with at most 10% &quot;at liberty&quot; for
prevention of disease. </P>
