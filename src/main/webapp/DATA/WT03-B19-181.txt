<P>
Australia's alrgest airfreight operations are conducted at Melbourne's
Tullamarine airport, only twenty minutes by road from the city
center. Operating 24 hours a day, it handles 327,000 tonnes of
freight each year, over half of which is international cargo.
<P>
A major redevelopment being currently undertaken will ensure Melbourne's
airport facilities continue serving demand, with new world-class
freight handling facilities being built and international passenger
handling capacity to double.
<P>
<i><b>Melbourne's airfreight costs are very competitive with other regional
centers. Melbourne's airfreight costs are nearly half those in
Singapore, 38% lower than Jakarta, 23% less than Hong Kong, and
69% lower than Osaka.</i></b>

<H3>&quot;As a freight hub, Tullamarine is first class. For us,
this is very much the place to do business. The airport has
no
curfew, we can fly things out whenever we want&quot;</H3>
