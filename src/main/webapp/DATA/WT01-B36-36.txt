<h4>Six accused in Chelsea drugs case</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Arrested at a flat in Pont Streets Chelsea, yesterday
    evening, an artist, writer, physician, company director and
    an art dealer and his wife were each remanded on £100 bail
    until March 18 at Marlborough Street today. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; All were charged with unauthorised possession
    of cannabis sativa (Indian Hemp). They are: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph Chase Hunt Mellen, 25, writer; John
    Laurence Doyle, 29, art director; and Mrs Monica Doyle, 23,
    all of Pont Street; Sheldon Cholst, 41, American physician
    and author of Pembridge Square, Bayswater; Mark Anthony
    Warman, 21, company director, of Bywater Street, Chelsea; and
    Michael John Hollingshead, 34, artist, and occupier of the
    flat, who was also accused of permitting it to be used for
    smoking cannabis.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Being busted is like going bald. By the time you
realise it is happening it is too late to do very much about it.
So one tries to minimise the consequences as best one can, though
of course the damage is already done. Later, perhaps, it may even
become one of those stories that, suitably edited, you tell
against yourself&#133; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No one was particularly surprised when the police
raided my flat. The place was a centre for all kinds of
psychedelic experimentation, and it was only a matter of time
before someone complained or turned me in. There had been a
number of 'incidents' surrounding the history of this flat, such
as a party attended by some eighty guests who got accidentally
turned on via a spiked fruit-and-wine punch, amongst whom were
some police spies masquerading as hippies. There was also the
problem of noise since the speakers were seldom off, always
playing at full volume. Yet despite all this, I observed the
scene with complete indifference; I was in any case unable or
unwilling to do very much about it. It was an oversight I was to
'learn to regret', as the saying goes. Indeed, yes, it was, for I
had not expected anything quite so serious as it subsequently all
turned out. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think this was due in part to the fact that Leary
himself had been busted in Laredo, Texas, only a short time
before the police in London got after me. Tim had been passing
through Laredo on his way to Mexico with his daughter, Susan, and
his son, Jackie, and Susan had a small stash of grass hidden in
her brassiere, which the American customs found. Tim did the only
thing a parent could do under such circumstances, he admitted
that the grass was his and that he knew where it had been hidden.
The Texan judge sentenced him to thirty years' imprisonment. And
Susan got off. The American Establishment had got their man. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this left me in a somewhat difficult situation
in London, for the plan had been that Tim would join me before
Easter for a big Psychedelic Rally, possibly even at the Albert
Hall, with pop musicians, poets and members of the British
underground taking part. I had come on ahead to set it up, and,
like a juggler, I had several things suspended in mid-air at any
one time in the sure knowledge that when Tim came he would be
able to act as my 'apologist' and catch them. Now that he was
unable to leave America, l suddenly found everything tumbling
about my head. My world had come crashing down and I was unable
or strangely unwilling to do much about it. I simply let events
take their course, that's all. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was difficult to explain any of this to either
the judge or the jury. The 'politics of ecstasy' was a completely
foreign world to them, and one moreover they seemed to equate
with drug-taking of the very worst kind. l had also violated the
law. I was now liable for a penalty of ten years' imprisonment
and a fine of £1000. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet despite the seriousness of the charges and the
fact that I would almost certainly be found guilty, I treated the
whole matter as an exercise in breathtaking intellectual
negligence. It seemed to me that the whole purpose of the British
legal system, with its roles and rules and rituals, is to
convince you that, by its gravity and seriousness, it knows
better than you do. And it was through this insight that I
decided to defend myself rather than have a barrister do it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had also taken some LSD before arriving at court,
which enhanced the unreality of the scene, myself high in the
witness box on a charge of getting high, the judge in his robes
and wig, the jury banked in rows like eggs, a gallery filled with
plain and faceless men, and I saw myself as an actor in a
B-movie. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was one exchange I remember; it was during my
cross-examination of a Detective Sgt. Dalton of the London Flying
Squad, who had arrested me in the first place. The case had begun
to drag a little. The witnesses&#151;for the
prosecution&#151;were uniformly serious in their evidence. They
all made me look like some kind of horrible pervert who took
non-prescription drugs as for themselves it would be, say, whisky
or beer. The scene had become 'heavy'. Now that Dalton was in the
witness-box, I could try to lighten the proceedings a little, and
addressing myself to him, I asked him to tell the court what he
had done when he first entered the bathroom, where the marijuana
had been found. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I went over to the toilet-bowl,' he replied. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Very good, you went over to the toilet-bowl,' I
said, carefully lowering my voice so that it was almost a
whisper. 'And did you see anything in there ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Excuse me, but I didn't hear the question.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I raised my voice slightly: 'Did you see anything
when you looked into the toilet-bowl ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes. I saw some leaves of what I believed to be <i>cannabis
sativa</i> floating on the surface of the water.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'So,' I said, my voice in rising crescendo, 'you
saw some grass floating about in the toilet. Well, isn't that a
good place for it, then&#151;<i>in the toilet-bowl?'</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought it was a good joke, and inoffensive, but
I was told later that it had probably cost me an extra six months
on my sentence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As it was, I was unprepared for the
sentence&#151;twenty-one months for less than an ounce of hashish
and a negligible amount of marijuana. It seemed altogether too
long and I must have just stood in the dock in utter amazement,
for the next thing I knew was being grabbed on both sides and
propelled down the staircase to the cells under the court, there
to await the Black Maria or something, to take me and the other
new prisoners to Wormwood Scrubs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When my name was finally called, I was brought out
and handcuffed and put in the van. And it was a strange sensation
to observe London through the grillwork and glass, handcuffed,
and coming down off a trip. It also happened that the van
actually drove past my old flat, and I wondered how I would have
reacted if a few weeks earlier someone had said that one day I
would be passing the place under the exact circumstance I
described. It was all very curious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon enough, however, we reached the Scrubs, a huge
mausoleum of a place that could have been built as a Victorian
factory, with high walls and gothic towers, dustbin-dirty in the
way of railway stations, and rife with the smell of incontinence
of urine. I felt as if I were entering the bowels of the earth. I
don't think that I have ever been quite so depressed as I was for
those first few minutes in prison. My soul turned grey, if such a
thing is possible. I felt drained of all light in this
netherworld place in which it was impossible to imagine how
anything had ever been young or beautiful. My sensibilities
simply turned themselves off in the face of this monstrous
universe. I could have been a stick a stone, a zombie, for here
there were none who could emphathise with my plight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But after a night's sleep, my heart began to
revive, and my curiosity about my unknown daily routine got the
adrenalin working. There was also the novelty of getting into my
new prison clothes&#151;a striped shirt with a black tie, socks
about quarter of an inch thick, a pair of trousers and
military-style jacket made of thick material, and a pair of heavy
marching boots. Nothing fitted properly, of course. Oh, I felt
like a walking scarecrow, which was probably the intention
anyway. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had no sooner got dressed than the landing
officer unlocked the cell and told me to go down and get
breakfast. The noise in the hall and passageways was quite
deafening, redolent with the sound of male voices, hoots of
laughter, crashing metal and bells. It was like living inside a
huge alarm-clock, I reflected, as I made my way down the narrow
iron staircase to the main hall. Prison is one huge sensory
deprivation tank, an incredible human vault that echoes to the
least footfall. It is a way of life to suit a sort of monk. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Breakfast consisted of a plate of watery porridge,
a couple of table-spoon measures of milk, a dry sausage, as much
bread and marge as you could eat, and a mug of tea. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After breakfast, I was told to go back to my cell
where I would be called during the morning to see the Governor
who liked to meet each new charge. He would also allocate my
work. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My cell was not very big. The walls had been
painted a sickening pink, the colour of corned beef, and the cell
door was a bright green. Light entered through a barred window
recessed some two feet into the wall. There was a table, a plank
hard chair, a bed, and a metal chamberpot. To look out of the
window you had to stand on the table, and it was possible to
discern in the distance beyond the high prison wall the contours
of the city, to look out nostalgically at all the lightness of
heart and foot going past in the park, never knowing for sure
whether you would ever rejoin it. This is something of what it
means to be a prisoner. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The morning passed with monstrous slowness. A
prison sentence is a certain fixed period of enforced idleness.
Things&#151;I was to learn&#151;have their own momentum of
realizability. You can rush your life on the outside by the
scruff of its neck, but in prison everything happens according to
the rules. It is a permanent 'working to rule', you might say;
rushing anything would be like trying to rush a stalactite. So
one needs to be philosophical about the slowness of it all and
develop the necessary mental and physical yogas to overcome
inertia, impatience and boredom. It's not so strange this world
as so different. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like most new inmates, I suppose, I went through
quite a few mental changes during those first few days. They were
appallingly difficult. My head was ambushed by depression and
stagnation, and it seemed that I was beset with all sorts of
cares, existential longings to be free again, angst. I think that
to be locked up without freedom&#151;that is, without access to
love&#151;is something you have to adapt yourself to, for man
cannot live by bread alone. We like to think it. And of course we
should, but we really cannot, you know. Individual human life
needs the closeness of another body, a warm hand or look, the
occasional kiss and merging with another. The inhuman regimen of
prison existences does not allow for spontaneity with joy, but
dictates a certain style of living in a prescribed manner, always
to form, always to rules accepted as facts. It is indeed an
experience of so-called reality. I continue to be amazed that
there are so few suicides, singly or even on mass scale, a
reaction to the tyranny of a system that allows bodies of men to
press on the bodies of men, and usually for so little reason. But
with patience and the passing of time, the mind-body adapts
itself, trying as best it can to keep a little flame of humanity
alight in the dark, womanless silence, and later, even achieve a
simple affirmation of the world. You must or otherwise you would
die. So you live on in the hopefulness that once beyond these
walls your heart will quicken and your tongue renew. I think
prison is really dedicated to the idea that we should think of
ways in which to bring each other down not up, and is thus the
antithesis of the aims of our new 'psychedelic revolution'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When the Governor finally sent for me, I was taken
to the main administration block, and told to remove my shoes
before entering his office. I saw the reason for this when I went
inside. The Governor sat at a desk about fourteen feet from where
I stood. We were separated by glossy linoleum as smooth and as
slippery as an ice-rick. It seemed that inmates were sometimes in
the habit of reacting violently to the Governor's decisions, and
this (almost) foolproof method protected him from assault. He had
of course nothing to fear in that way from myself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Chief Prison Officer gave my number and name to
the Governor, who looked up and asked me if I had ever been to
prison before. 'No, but I've worked in a prison.' 'In this
country ?' the Governor asked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'No, in America, at a maximum security prison. I
was with a group of people from Harvard who used to run LSD
sessions for some of the inmates&#151;revelation followed by
reformation, that sort of stuff.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes, I see. Now, it seems you were charged with
possession of dangerous drugs. And that is why you are here now.
It seems a pity that someone like yourself who is obviously
well-educated and literate should find consolation in drugs. How
is such a thing possible ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the New York call-girl from Radcliff who is
asked how a nice girl like her came to be in such an occupation,
I replied 'Just lucky, I guess.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Governor also expressed concern about what work
to give me. He finally settled on the steam laundry. And I was
told to report there after lunch. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The chief laundry officer was an amiable sort of
man who had been at the same job for twenty years. He began by
showing me around the laundry. There were huge steam rollers and
presses, washers and dryers, ironing rooms and drying rooms, and
about thirty prisoners variously engaged in keeping the flow of
laundry moving at maximum speed, or so it seemed at the time. He
then showed me what I had to do. My job carried 'a lot of
responsibility'; I was on the reception desk, and I had to check
in and check out all the laundry and to see that what came in
also tallied with what went out. A simple enough job on the face
of it. There was one snag, however: the nurses' laundry. It could
happen, if one didn't watch the articles like a hawk, that
brassieres and panties simply 'disappeared' at some stage on the
way through the various laundry processes. And a number of such
articles often found their way back to the cells. My main job,
the officer told me, was to see that this didn't happen. There
was also a complicated system of record keeping, which was
explained to me, but my brain couldn't embrace all the details
and I simply 'tuned out' halfway through the hour-long laborious
explanation by the officer. The result was that by the end of the
third day the laundry was besieged with complaints, particularly
from the nurses' home, which reported nearly a dozen panties
missing and several brassieres. There were also complaints from
the long-term prisoners, for whom clean laundry was one of the
few remaining pleasures, who were understandably impatient that
their bespoke shirts or specially fitted trousers had not been
returned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was transferred to the ironing room and told to
iron shirts. Here again I seemed to get things cocked or somehow
not quite right. And this time the complaints were that shirts
were coming back from the laundry with big burn marks, missing
buttons, and twisted collars. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once more I found myself standing shoeless before
the Governor. I had not been charged with negligence or
insubordination, but the implication was there. I was given a
'second chance' and transferred to the book bindery, which is
considered something of a plum of a job at Wormwood Scrubs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The book bindery is run by a civilian, and it is
quiet. In appearance it resembled a Dickensian solicitor's
office, with high tables and chairs and strained faces buried in
piles of books. I was put in the paperback section to be trained
in the craft of hard-cover binding, a job by which none would be
particularly impressed but requiring a certain amount of manual
skill, nonetheless. The civilian supervisor told me in this
connection that book-binding required three things: 'The first is
dexterity, the second is dexterity, and the third is dexterity.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was glad to be away from the old steam laundry
and was quite enjoying my new job when another one of those
unwritten minor tragedies occurred. I had left a foot-high stack
of books in the press; the new covers had been glued on and the
idea was to let them dry overnight. This was the culmination of a
week's work, and I was naturally excited to see how the finished
products looked in the morning. The civilian supervisor came over
with me to unscrew the press and see what kind of a job I had
made on my first assignment. He began to turn the handle; and his
dismay was equal to my own, for all the bindings had stuck
together with the result that the books rose as one, in
concertina fashion, and then crashed on to the floor, sending
loose pages all over the place. The civilian supervisor stood for
a moment, his mouth wide open, and then said very, very slowly,
and with great pathos: 'Good God! Good God! Good God!' (I was
with him on the first two all right, but he lost me on the
third.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That was the end of my stay in the book bindery. A
complaint was made to the Governor who immediately despatched me
to a foetid factory building to sew mailbags, the final
degradation, no doubt, for after mailbags there is nowhere
further down the work rung to go, except possibly being a waiter
in the Prison Officer's Mess. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the slowness of the Himalayan range, it
seemed, my average uneventful days passed into routinely ordinary
weeks. There had been quite a bit of news about hash and LSD in
the daily Press, mainly about people getting busted, so that by
the beginning of the summer quite a few of my friends were inside
with me&#151;Nick Douglas, the painter; Hugh Blackwell, the
writer; Hugh Lansdowne, the poet; Pat Ryan, the musician; Robert
Fraser, the art gallery owner; and John Hopkins, one of the
editors of the <i>International Times</i> of whom Christopher
Logue wrote in his poem: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Mistakes like mine occur<br>
    Bored with the cosy spiral of my galaxy<br>
    I went off limits<br>
    And time slammed around me like<br>
    The door into a pillar box.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there were to be several hundred more
'psychedelic' inmates in British jails before the year was out. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Press was having a field-day on the topic. Pot
and LSD were the new twin menaces of our Western kind of society,
evils which had to be stamped out. 'At least 100,000 more Britons
will take psychedelic drugs this year in spite of new provisions
in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1966,' said one headline, and went
on to say that this figure was the result of twelve-month
nationwide survey conducted by a Dr. Jim Marle, the Atlantic
psychiatrist, at a meeting in Oxford. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact this was more likely to happen <i>because</i>
of the provisions in the Dangerous Drugs Act. Restrict anything
and immediately people want it. There must be thousands of
readers now buying grass and LSD who would never have done so but
for articles of this kind; and quite a few I daresay now believe
that LSD is compulsory, like vaccination or fluoridation Besides,
total prohibition has never worked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet drugs is a subject that can never come under
discussion without so much emotion that rational argument becomes
obscured if not totally banished. The Press, and to some extent
publishers as well, seem to delight in touching people where they
are most vulnerable&#151;producing articles and books which
threaten the incredulous and the superstitious. Whenever one of
these articles or books appears in public they set off a chain of
articles or letters, each more heated than the last. This is
possible because the problems concerned with drugs are not
susceptible to single convulsive solutions. It is as though where
questions of morality come in that detachment quits the scene. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And often the Press would slant a particular piece
so that not even an idiot reader could miss the point. One
example comes to mind, also from this period in the mid-sixties.
It is from the now defunct <i>Daily Sketch.</i> It showed a
photograph of Leary, smart and serious in a suit, deep in
conversation with the reporter. The article was headed 'I'll Turn
On Britain, says the leader of the Drug Church'. And Leary is
then quoted as saying: 'I don't imagine I shall run into as much
opposition for my religion in Britain as I have here in the
States. The British are more tolerant and have a sense of
humour.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The question of drugs inside the prison was also a
matter of some concern, for as the 'psychedelic' inmate
population rose, and as other prisoners became cognizant of the
phenomena LSD and hashish, there was a corresponding increase in
their availability. Many ways were used to get psychedelics in,
from felt-tip pens stuffed with Red Lebanese to bunches of grapes
spiked with acid. I myself had a reasonably steady supply of
hashish, and a stash of LSD which Richard Alpert and Owsley had
left during their visit to the Scrubs. There was very little if
anything the prison authorities could do to stop it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, I would often be approached by other
prisoners to tell them something about these drugs, or they
simply wanted to score. And as a general rule, I would share any
hashish I might happen to have, whilst refusing to give them LSD,
that is, unless they were already pretty experienced in using it.
There were exceptions, however, most notable of these being
George Blake, the spy then serving a sentence of forty-three
years' imprisonment. He had served about five years of his
sentence when I met him. And it was not long before we were
having long discussions about 'turning on'; and he said he would
like to try it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We decided to run a session on the Sunday, when the
cells in 'D' Hall are left open all afternoon and one can roam at
will about the landings without supervision. Blake's cell was on
the ground floor, comfortably furnished with a carpet and
curtains, a bookcase stuffed with books and, on the table, a
short-wave radio, which he had somehow acquired in order 'to
listen to Arabic language stations'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing much happened for the first hour. But as
the session developed, Blake became quite tense, a nervous strain
verging on complete paranoia, and seemed to believe that I was a
Secret Service agent who had administered him a truth serum. He
told me that I'd be killed within the next twenty-four hours, and
made other similar threats. I felt quite baffled as to what to
do, so I did nothing, merely listened as he went through his
flip-out, and tried to reassure him by means of treating the
whole affair as if it were all somehow something quite ordinary
strewn into the everyday, though secretly I was quite alarmed in
case a prison officer happened to look in and hear what was going
on. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He finally settled down, however, and the last
couple of hours were spent in deep thought and quiet reflection
concerning his future existence, and he said he might not be able
to stand up to many more years of incarceration. I suggested
they'd probably let him out on parole in a few years' time, but
he doubted this. He felt that he was in prison as a living
warning to others who might be similarly tempted. But I said that
was an old cliché, and had never worked anyway. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As it happened, Blake escaped only a few weeks
after the session, by scaling the wall one Sunday afternoon by
means of a rope-ladder thrown over by an accomplice, who had been
in touch with him via the short-wave radio in his cell. When I
last heard about him, he was living in Moscow and working for the
Cairo Section of the Russian Foreign Ministry. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I had been at Wormwood Scrubs for about four
months when I was asked about going to an 'open prison' at
Leyhill, near the English-Welsh border. I said I'd prefer the
country. And shortly after this interview, I was transferred to
Leyhill Prison. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leyhill was in some sense a reprieve from the
double-dense monotony of a 'closed' prison like the Scrubs, where
no-life and all-life hang precariously together there. Here in
the country one could not only see the beauty of the natural
landscape but also feel it, and I am eternally grateful to
whoever it was who got me there. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon arrival, I was taken to the kitchen and given
a dinner of fried eggs, bacon, beans and chips, freshly baked
rolls and butter some cake, and coffee. The Duty Officer told me
that there were some 450 inmates and two night guards, that there
were no walls or fences surrounding the prison, and that anyone
was free to escape at any time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was then shown into a dormitory of about fourteen
people and given a bed and bedside locker. Pat Ryan, the
musician, occupied the bed on my right, and Jerry, a singer and
lyricist, the one on my left. They had both been busted for
hashish. A couple of others in the dormitory had also been
similarly busted for possession, and not a few of the ordinary
prisoners were starting to smoke. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was called to meet the Governor the next morning.
He was an amiable, elderly Scot, who managed our meeting very
well. He told me that this was his retirement year, that his wife
was dying of cancer, and that he was a lover of Robert Burns and
Ella Wheeler Wilcox. He suggested that I join both the bridge
club and the debating club, help start a flying club, and apply
for a course in fish ecology at nearby Bristol University, all of
which I subsequently did. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My first job at Leyhill was as a waiter at the
Prison Officers' Training School, which was sited in the former
Earl of Ducy's estate and house, next to the prison. It was a
good job as it meant in effect that one ate civilian food, which
made quite a change from the plain prison fare. And the work was
far from boring. I would wait on about four tables at which would
be four trainee prison officers attending their eight-week
induction course. I was probably the first live prisoner they had
ever seen. And it was interesting to observe their reactions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My initial approach would never vary. I'd meet them
at the table on their first day, extend my hand to each one, and
welcome them individually. By the end of the second day they all
knew why I was in prison. And by the end of the week, our
conversation was generally about ways to get high. Some of the
groups were quite generous, and would slip me the occasional
bottle of wine. Some let me use their billiard room. Some even
said they were looking forward to meeting me again at some point
in my future, when they would see that I got an easy deal. They
were a pleasant crowd, by and large, mostly respectable
working-class, who needed some kind of job with tenure in order
to keep their game going. It was a job. It gave financial
security. It made their respectability possible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life at Leyhill had a particular flavour all its
own. Physically, the layout was perfect. There was a huge sports
ground with cricket, rugby, and soccer pitches, running tracks,
and places to fly your kite. The Ducy estate contained an
arboretum filled with trees and bushes from every part of the
world, a constant delight to both mind and eye. There was one
tree in particular I was attracted to. It was Japanese and, I
believe, magical, whose flowering one spring turned me on to the
plant kingdom. The exquisite beauty of this tree was like a
window in which you could see the existence of this Other World.
And it was a point of routine for me to spend most of my lunch
time smoking praises for Shankar in the half-lotus position under
the boughs of this holy tree. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the highlights of my stay at Leyhill was the
production of a physio-psychedelic musical called <i>Paradise
Lost &#151; The True Story,</i> which had been sent to me by Joey
Mellen, friend and former associate from Pont Street, who had
decided that the best way to stay permanently 'high' was by
trepanning a hole in his head the size of the old sixpenny piece.
The play was a strange mixture of Milton and Mellen, with lyrics
in praise of trepanation or 'getting the hole'. I reproduce one
of the songs below, called 'The Great Brain Robbery': </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>THE GREAT BRAIN ROBBERY<br>
    By Joe Mellen </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Up stood the ape&#151;down came the drag&#151;<br>
    The beginning of the blues&#151;<br>
    Can't talk your way out of it adult <br>
    Daddy there's a drag on you. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Oh adult the mistakes you make <br>
    You ignorant little man <br>
    Adult oh the liberties you take <br>
    You mistaken little man. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Between your meals you make your deals <br>
    And send your sons to war <br>
    Talk all you want but don't you know <br>
    We've heard it all before. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Adult will you never see<br>
    All you want is to agree&#151;<br>
    The lies you tell to save your face <br>
    Constitute your grave disgrace. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You're losing and you think you're gaining <br>
    It's just your ego needs maintaining <br>
    Adult d'you know what is true ? <br>
    The drag is bearing down on you. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>What you're trying to regain <br>
    Is blood belonging to your brain <br>
    Will you know before you're dead <br>
    That paradise is in your head ?<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You was robbed&#151;so you made belief&#151;<br>
    It's gravity&#151;we've caught the thief <br>
    All you prayers won't save your soul <br>
    Adult you need a hole. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another song, called 'Brainbloodvolume', has been
set to music by Julie Felix in her furthest-out number yet. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>BRAINBLOODVOLUME </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It was lost and now it's found again <br>
    Don't drive it underground again <br>
    Brainbloodvolume&#151;<br>
    They call it love and heaven above <br>
    Some take it for the hell of it <br>
    That's sugarlack&#151;<br>
    Brainbloodvolume&#151;<br>
    It's you it's me it's good <br>
    Understood ? <br>
    Brainbloodvolume. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's what the poets have written for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Painters have painted for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Priests have prayed for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Prisons have filled for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Soldiers have killed for <br>
    Brainbloodvolume. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's what the pipes have been smoked for<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Witches have been cloaked for<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Headstands have been done for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The whole thing was begun for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It's what the world was made for <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The price must be paid for&#151;<br>
    Brainbloodvolume. </p>
</blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; It was necessary to approach the Governor to obtain
permission to stage it in the prison theatre, perhaps even before
an invited audience of students from Bath and Bristol
universities. I decided to plug the Milton section at the expense
of the rest, feeling that the Governor would be more sympathetic
to it than the modern additions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Governor was most attentive during my outline
of the play, and wrote a memo to the Prison Chaplain that he
should consider staging it one Sunday in the Church. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I met with the Chaplain, a nice,
easygoing man with a strong sense of Christian vocation, who had
been at Leyhill for four years and had a good understanding of
prisoner psychology. I introduced the matter by suggesting that
there is a mystery in the story of <i>Paradise Lost</i> that lies
at the heart of all our lives. And this is older than that of
Oedipus. In the play there are overtones of the great four
stories of the world's various religions, and specifically of the
Hebrew-Christian tradition. Guilt and Sin are pretty powerful
themes of the Christian Church, and any attempt to understand
their place in the world and their relevance to contemporary man
was, I assured him, a matter of concern to today's criminal. One
begins by depicting man as some kind of &quot;hairless talking
ape&quot; who is unable to benefit from the possibilities of his
own existence, who then has a revelation, in this instance,
through piercing a small hole through his skull to increase the
volume of blood to the brain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Chaplain looked puzzled. 'But what has <i>Paradise
Lost</i> got to do with making holes in your head ?' he asked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Well, the theory is that by increasing the amount
of blood to the brain the surface of the
capillaries&#151;millions of them&#151;increases, which in turn
release glucose from the blood into the brain cells. This is the
physiological secret of &quot;getting high&quot;. So the
&quot;hairless talking ape&quot; who does not know that his
&quot;fall&quot; (loss of brainbloodvolume) has a purely
physiological cause. Thus he lives out his simple life or death
without ever realising his golden future, truly the parable of
fallen man.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'It sounds all rather godless to me.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Well, the modern writer uses myths and metaphors
in order to get his message across. And in the case of this play,
he has found modern counterparts to the story of the Fall in
poetry, science, and music to express an awareness that we all
have, however obscurely, that there are vast capacities in man
which he continually fails to realise. The message of the play is
simple. If things are not right inside yourself, then change
them. The evolutionary leap in being from monkey to man produced
a new kind of animal, a creative animal, an animal with
imagination, who could devise ways to regain the lost paradise of
lost brainbloodvolume.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But why trepanation ?' the Chaplain persisted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Because trepanation offers a solution on a
manageable scale.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'A solution to what ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'A solution to the problem of staying
&quot;high&quot;.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But what has staying &quot;high&quot; got to do
with putting on a musical play in my Church?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The Governor and I thought that because of the
religious themes you might&#133; ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But I find the whole thing utterly
&quot;godless&quot;, and I could never allow such a production to
be shown. And now that you have explained it to me, I doubt
whether I could allow it to be performed in the theatre.
Prisoners are very suggestible you know, and we could not risk
wholesale trepanations. It is just what the <i>Daily Express</i>
are looking for. I really think, Hollingshead, that you ought to
concentrate instead on more practical plans for your own future
than try to launch a social movement based on people putting
holes in their heads. Have you ever considered the profession of
the church ?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I'm sorry you don't like the play. I thought you
would. What we are seeing today is merely the visible aspect of a
universal neurosis, and the Fall myths, in whatever language,
illustrate humanity's unconscious awareness of human suffering,
which is the failure of humanity which <i>Paradise Lost</i>
symbolises. God is simply a creative power which is part of human
life in the Garden. A voice within man tells him that he can and
should regain the lost brainblood of childhood&#151;should
exercise some degree of control over his own consciousness, in
other words, which is the message of the new developing religions
in the West. The problem facing the established Church is that if
man lived up to his full creative capacities, there would be no
religion.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We decided to go ahead anyway, and started
rehearsals. Hugh Landsdowne, a poet and magician, who had been
imprisoned for growing half an acre of marijuana at his farm in
Essex, linked in the <i>I Ching;</i> and together we made a huge
stroboscopic mandala with an electric motor we pinched from one
of the machines in the tailor's shop. The play was never
performed in either the church or the theatre, due to the
misunderstanding as to what the play was actually about; but it
was seen by most of the inmates at some point in its actual
unfolding; and helped keep our minds off more dangerous matters. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I tend to remember perhaps only the positive things
about my last year in prison. Yet in all honesty I cannot rid
myself of the thought that my life there might have been very,
very different indeed. I think all of us carry around in our
heads some picture of how we imagine prison life to be, though
doubtless altogether impossible to identify in reality. Mine was
a superstitious mixture of Gestapo camps and what I had seen in
American movies. The reality is quite different; there is, for
instance, very little real fear of the intentions of the prison
authorities, who tend to stick to a rule book that does not
include physical brutality or torture or idiosyncratic sadism.
There is also very little physical violence going on between
inmates, though incidents happen from time to time, like anywhere
else. Man is only human after all. And violence is part of his
human nature. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet&#133; the experience of prison <i>is </i>a
painful one. It may be no more than an enduring slight headache,
but it is always there, forever encroaching on your private
world, an impersonal, indifferent environment in which you are
physically contained; and all for the greater public good. Prison
is a feeling, a subjective as well as a purely physical thing. It
hits directly at your sensations, but acting more like a dampener
than an actual brake. It lowers by its sense of decay, its
corridors of refuse, its wasteland approach to fallen humanity.
No wonder one feels saddened to observe how as our twentieth
century develops so too does the machinery of incarceration and
the illegality of our various legal actions, who seek to condemn
even the children who comprise our future brave generation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prison is some kind of other place in which I would
never wish for anyone to have to live out their simple life or
death. </p>
