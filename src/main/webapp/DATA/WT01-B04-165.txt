&quot;Legalization is a flawed concept. Those who support it are only looking
at the issue of drug abuse from a financial standpoint. The notion that
somehow legalization will take the underworld element out of the drug trade
and result in lower drug prices is ludicrous. To think that this will somehow
reduce the drug problem is flawed logic. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, drug use would become far more widespread and rampant. Our models
on this are alcohol and tobacco. They represent extremely serious health
hazards. Why should we add cocaine, marijuana, etc., to this spectrum of
potential physical and psychological disaster? <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana is clearly addictive, is responsible for behavioral, intellectual
and cognitive deficits, and is responsible for severe side-effects to the
pulmonary, reproductive and immune systems as well.&quot; (E. Voth, M.D.,
FACP) <BR>

&quot;Pro-legalization advocates appeal to emotion, not reason. Legalization
or decriminalization is not drug reform; it is drug retardation, taking
us back to the lax drug policy of the 70's.&quot; (R. Peterson, Esq.) <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Those who would legalize drugs fall into two categories -- Pollyannas
who are incredibly naive or uninformed, or children playing with matches.
Legalization is a Pandora's box, which if opened would unleash a tide that
will sweep away prevention and treatment.&quot; (D. Risley, Esq.) <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The greatest danger of legalization is to our youth. Adolescents are
the most difficult to diagnose and treat. Many slip through the cracks.
The window for learning is gone; opportunities are lost. It is impossible
to regain those years -- too late to become an engineer, astronaut, physicist.
The legalization debate is sparked by marijuana, and inherent in marijuana
use is denial. Some Harvard individuals are selling their denial.&quot;
