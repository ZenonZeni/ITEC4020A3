<FONT SIZE=2>If you do not live in close proximity to any of our offices in Marton, NJ, Melrose Park, PA, Newark, DE or Bayonne, NJ, your daily monitoring may be done at an outside facility.  During an acutal treatment cycle, the female member of an IVF couple may have to be in teh Philadelphia/South Jersey area for up to one week prior to the egg retrieval, and until at least 3 days after the egg retrieval.  If an ultrasound and lab facility are available to you in your home town, then follicular maturation may be monitored there prior to the oocyte retrieval.  The ultrasound and lab facility you use must be able to provide same day results.  The results must be faxed to the Marlton office at (609) 751-7289 before 5:00PM daily.  There will be an out of town management fee of $165.00 per cycle to cover the expense of monitoring by telephone.  <p>
The male partner must be available the day of the egg retrieval, as well as the day after, so that anotehr semen specimen can be obtained.  This may be necessary for reinseminating the eggs.  The partner is usually present for the embryo transfer, which is performed on the third day after the retrieval. 
<p>
The normal ranges for blood tests vary from lab to lab, therefore, whenever possible it is best to use the Endocrine Testing Ltd. laboratory.  Please contact the lab at (215)635-4882 or (800) 6-ETL-ETL for instructions on how to mail specimens to the lab.  Nevertheless, for those patients that have a managed care insurance plan that requires the use of a specific lab, we can usually make the appropriate adjustments so that no additional financial burden will occur.</FONT>
