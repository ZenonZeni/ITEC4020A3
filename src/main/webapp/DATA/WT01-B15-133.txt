<body><strong>Working Toward A Conclusion</strong>

<p>
Good Morning.  I appreciate having another opportunity to share my view of the U.S. radioactive waste management program with this audience.  This conference represents an unusual forum.  It is the largest regular gathering of people who are technically knowledgeable about the challenge of demonstrating the viability of geologic disposal of high-level radioactive waste.
<p>
As I stated last year, to accomplish that objective, we will continually have to articulate the rationale and progress of the scientific program to constituencies that are more concerned with societal values, economic and financial considerations, and sometimes narrow parochial interests and partisan political motives.  We have no inherent right to invest public resources in the geologic disposal option.  We have to justify our purpose and our investment to the public whenever and wherever it is questioned, and in terms that can be understood.
<p>
For the U.S. program, this past year has been a critical period of questioning, examination, and revision.
<p>
<strong>Program Funding and Progress</strong>
<p>
In 1994, we proposed a program approach and funding profile that would permit us to meet the policy goals set by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  That approach was funded by the Congress and pursued with the Fiscal Year 1995 appropriation.
<p>
I am happy to report that we have made significant progress since last year.  We allocated almost the entire increase in funding that was appropriated for Fiscal Year 1995 to the Yucca Mountain Project.  We completed the year with most of our goals met and accomplishments that often exceeded our targets.
<p>
At Yucca Mountain, we have completed more than one-half of the planned five mile exploratory tunnel, and are now well ahead of schedule.  The tunnel is into the repository horizon, and provides scientists with direct access to the sites geology.  The data collected in the tunnel, along with a decade of scientific work at the site will provide us with a sound evaluation of the important hypotheses that we will rely upon for the design of a repository and the assurance of its safety.
<p>
I am pleased to note that the independent Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which follows the technical progress of the program in detail, acknowledged our progress at Yucca Mountain in a letter to Secretary OLeary.  The Board stated that our emerging waste isolation strategy and our recent advances in repository performance assessment will enable us to achieve a better understanding of the proposed repository site "in less time and at less cost."
<p>
Last Fall, however, in a climate of deficit reduction and in the midst of a policy debate over the issues of interim storage, Congress did not fund the continuation of our previous program approach.  A reduced total appropriation to the program along with a reservation of part of the funds for future work on interim storage presented us with a 40 percent reduction in funding for the fiscal year we are now managing.  
<p>
Congress recognized that the reduction would require a more constrained repository program and provided guidance in that regard.  In response to Congressional direction and the Presidents policy direction, we are preparing a new, more concentrated program plan that can regain a target for a license application within a reasonable time, but which requires only moderately increased funding in future years.  
<p>
As part of that plan, we have refocused our efforts at Yucca Mountain on the most significant remaining issues.  We have defined a set of tasks that will complete the unique portions of the repository design; evaluate its potential performance in the geologic setting; and provide a more precise estimate of the cost to construct a repository.  We will complete these tasks by 1998.
<p>
This package of products will not represent a formal decision on the suitability of the site.  Rather, it is an effort to converge the work already done upon the most important remaining questions concerning the viability of a repository proposal.  These questions include not only the key scientific and engineering judgements, but also the cost and capability issues that can determine the ultimate feasibility of going forward with a repository proposal.
<p>
We have had to defer many licensing activities in 1996, and the Congress recognized that we would do so.  Submitting a successful license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, remains central to our mission under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and to the Presidents policy on high-level waste management.  If the Yucca Mountain site proves to be suitable, we believe we can file and an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002 for a permit to construct the repository.  That target will depend in part upon our success in updating the regulatory framework.  Based on the extensive understanding we have developed over the years of site investigation, and recognizing the policy changes that have occurred over the past 10 years, we intend to propose revisions to the Departments siting guidelines (10 CFR Part 960) to create a more efficient process for evaluating the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site.  We expect to realize substantial efficiencies in the remaining work by focusing our process and our science and engineering upon the particular, site-specific safety case that must be made.
<p>
This work will be going forward along with the development of a site-specific radiological protection standard for Yucca Mountain by the Environmental Protection Agency and conformance of the licensing regulations to this new standard by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  We will continue to consult with the Commission and other stakeholders as the regulatory framework for the geologic repository is updated.
<p>
Our Fiscal Year 1996 funding situation required us to terminate our canister and cask development work.  The work completed should prove useful to the private sector, and we will rely upon the marketplace to provide the needed technologies.  We have also reduced the cost of programwide management and administration significantly.  We have had to reduce the funding of our cooperative agreements with program stakeholders.  In future years, we will apply a much greater proportion of overall funding to the specific deliverables of the programs business centers.  Those are the decision about disposal at the Yucca Mountain site, the development of a capability to accept and transport spent fuel and high-level waste, and if the policy issues are resolved, the efficient and effective provision of Federal interim storage.
<p>
<strong>Program Outlook</strong>
<p>
The Administration's budget request for Fiscal Year 1997 now pending before the Congress supports this approach.  The revision to our December 1994 Program Plan, which I expect to complete in a few weeks, outlines the work scope for the program.  The necessity to respond quickly to the unanticipated Fiscal Year 1996 fund reduction and to develop concurrently an Administration proposal for the Fiscal Year 1997 budget foreclosed the opportunity for an extensive consultative process during the preparation of the plan.  The new plan, however, flows smoothly from our previous planning efforts.  Its essential elements will be familiar to those who have closely followed our strategic planning process and the implementation of the program over the past two years.  The major policy directions have evolved out of the Congressional appropriations process in which many of our stakeholders have actively participated. 
<p>
Of the total request of $400 million for Fiscal Year 1997, 85 percent ($339 million) would go to the Yucca Mountain Project.  During the fiscal year, we will complete the five-mile exploratory tunnel and the construction of all major underground test alcoves.  We will initiate heater tests in the repository rock to simulate the effects of heat generated by radioactive waste packages and to study the structural and hydrologic response.  We will penetrate the Ghost Dance Fault, a major geologic feature of the mountain, first by drilling and then by tunneling.  I expect the results of this work to provide a great deal of enlightenment about the movement of water in the mountain.  We will also advance the detailed design of those engineered features of the repository concept that are critical to an evaluation of its technical, economic, and overall feasibility.
The $10 million we are requesting for our waste acceptance, storage, and transportation activities will support our legal oversight responsibilities concerning commercial spent fuel.  We will also continue planning for the transportation and interim storage of spent fuel.  We will examine a market-based approach to acquire that transportation capability.  Procurements would be used to obtain the needed shipping services from private vendors.  They would arrange to collect spent fuel from power plant sites and deliver it to a Federal storage or disposal facility.
<p>
We also intend to engage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in pre-licensing discussions on a non-site-specific basis that concern the technical and procedural aspects of licensing a phased interim storage facility.
<p>
The $51 million request for program management is 12.6 percent of the total program budget, down from 16.3 percent in Fiscal Year 1996, and from 25 percent in Fiscal Year 1993.  This amount covers all of our Federal salaries and related work expenses; the nuclear quality assurance efforts required by our regulators; and overall program planning, integration, human resources, and general business administration activities.
<p>
<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>
<p>
I believe that the planning we have done and the momentum we gained in Fiscal Year 1995 have enabled us to make progress, despite the severely constrained funding we received in Fiscal Year 1996.
<p>
A great deal remains to be done, but we are narrowing the range of unresolved scientific and engineering issues.  We intend to address the most important unfinished issues as early as possible.
<p>
The direction we are taking will, by 1998, provide us with a good evaluation of the prospects for a successful repository proposal at the Yucca Mountain site.  With adequate funding and an updated regulatory process  we can regain a target date, of 2002, for the submittal of a competent license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<p>
Thank you.
