<b>KNOW YOUR TERRAIN<br>
Seeing Disease Before It Manifests</b><p>
A new laboratory testing device called Biological Terrain Assessment (BTA S-1000) developed by naturopathic physician and chiropractor Robert Greenberg, D.C., N.M.D., enables physicians to see evidence of disease at the cellular level before it manifests. Cellular conditions are referred to as biological terrain and represent a generalized picture of the biochemical and electrical health of an individual at the cellular level. The state of your biological terrain is the bedrock of your health.<p>
The BTA S-1000 uses microelectrodes to measure 9 scientific values from samples of a patient's blood, urine, and saliva. The results are analyzed and plotted automatically by the instrument's computer then displayed in graph form on a monitor. Typically the procedure takes 10-15 minutes to complete.<p>
BTA enables the trained practitioner to find conditions that are still subpathological, often long before they develop into concrete illnesses. "If in checking we find that your cellular chemistry—biological terrain—is going astray, we know that your entire cellular functioning will soon follow, resulting in illness," Dr. Greenberg explains. "This enables us to then start correcting the imbalance using natural means, such as nutrition, supplements, or homeopathy, among others, before your condition becomes pathological and requires more invasive medical procedures."<p>  	
For example, 100 healthy college students at the University of California at San Luis Obispo were selected for evaluation with BTA S-1000. The individuals were selected according to standard medical norms for "healthy." However, the biological terrain assessment indicated that many of the students had suboptimal biochemical values. Routine exposure to environmental and dietary contaminants presumably was compromising their health at the cellular level, says Dr. Greenberg.<p>
The key point here, he says, is that terrain assessment "gives you the ability to see if the patient's chemistry is running optimally, even if he is not experiencing any symptoms." Further, the approach can reveal information of clinical importance that standard medical tests—blood, urine, MRIs, CAT scans—may miss, especially when a patient feels or looks unwell yet no organic evidence of illness has manifested. While the standard test values for such a patient may come back optimal, under BTA they will probably come back suboptimal, says Dr. Greenberg.<p>
Among the parameters evaluated by BTA S-1000, the 3 most central are pH (a measure of acidity or alkalinity), oxidation-reduction potential (a measure of electron movement donation/reduction and accepting/oxidation), and resistivity (a measure of a fluid's ability to conduct an electrical charge).<p> 
The BTA S-1000 is also capable of identifying unsuspected causes for chronic problems. Dr. Greenberg evaluated Susan, aged 36, who had frequent outbreaks of debilitating herpes sores in her mouth. During an episode, they would become so numerous that Susan had trouble eating and drinking. She had consulted many physicians and tried all the drugs they prescribed, but nothing helped her.<p> 
"We did a biological terrain assessment and discovered a cellular picture that looked very much like a heavy metal profile," says Dr. Greenberg. On this basis, he ordered a hair analysis and 24-hour urine test, both of which revealed that Susan had high concentrations of mercury, probably leached into her tissues from her dental amalgams. She had all her mercury amalgams replaced and in the last 18 months has not had a single herpes sore, says Dr. Greenberg.<p>

<b>NUTRIENTS TO HELP REVERSE MACULAR DEGENERATION</b><p>
Macular degeneration is a sight-threatening disorder that affects an estimated 4 million older adults. In this condition, the macula, or central area of the retina, and its pigment deteriorate, resulting in the loss of sharp vision. Macular degeneration is the leading cause of severe visual loss in the U.S. and Europe for individuals 55 years and older, and is the third leading cause of impaired vision for those over 65. <p>
Although the condition is associated with aging, it may also partly result from nutritional deficiencies. According to medical researcher Bill Sardi, at least 8 out of 10 opthalmalogists prescribe nutritional supplements for patients with macular disease, knowing that there are sound clinical reasons why the eyes might respond to nutritional intervention. "Nutritional supplements offer the greatest hope for a cure for this debilitating problem," says Sardi.<p>
Recognizing this, Carlson Laboratories developed Eye-Rite, a nonprescription formula containing key nutrients essential for eye functions. Of specific benefit to the eyes in this formula are lutein, proanthocyanidins, and soy protein.<p>
Lutein is a yellow carotenoid pigment found naturally in kale, collards, and mustard greens, among other green leafy vegetables. It is also present in the center of the retina. A 1980 study showed that animals deprived of dietary lutein developed accelerated rates of macular disease, reports Sardi. More recently, a 1994 study showed that adults eating 3-5 weekly servings of spinach had a 43% reduced risk for macular degeneration.<p>
Other research shows that of the 3 primary risk groups for macular degeneration (smokers, postmenopausal women, and people with blue, green, and hazel eyes) each tends to have markedly lower than average lutein levels. Sardi also cites anecdotal reports from individuals with blue eyes who report their vision brighter and sharper, their color perception enhanced, and glare reduced when taking lutein supplements. Benefits usually take 6-8 weeks to become noticeable, says Sardi. "This provides compelling evidence that retinal lutein levels are involved in macular disease," he concludes.<p>
In the advanced stage of macular degeneration, blood vessels in the eye may begin hemorrhaging or new blood vessels (capillaries) form inappropriately at the back of the eyes. The nutritional antidote for weak capillaries are bioflavonoids, natural substances that enhance the activities of vitamin C. Among these is a group called proanthocyanidins, which are deep red and blue pigments, commonly found in blueberries, bilberries, cranberries, and Concord grapes. <p>
These substances work with vitamin C to strengthen the eyes' capillaries, Sardi explains. He notes that in Europe extracts from proanthocyanidins are regularly prescribed (at a minimum therapeutic dose of 120 mg daily) for macular degeneration. Carlson's Eye-Rite contains 120 mg of proanthocyanidins derived from bilberry, cranberry, and grape seed extracts.<p>
The third nutrient in this formula of benefit to the eyes is soy isoflavone concentrate, a protein component of soybeans. This ingredient addresses the nutritional needs of postmenopausal women and seeks to preempt their susceptibility to macular degeneration, Sardi says. <p>
Women who have gone through menopause have an estimated 400% increased risk for this eye condition due to diminished production of the hormone estrogen. Lowered estrogen levels lead to a reduction in HDL cholesterol. "Lutein is transported from the liver to the retina primarily on HDL cholesterol," Sardi explains. "As estrogen and HDL levels drop, the density of retinal lutein dwindles in the postmenopausal years." <p>
Soy protein is a natural (though weak) plant source of estrogen that can help maintain HDL cholesterol levels and thereby maintain proper lutein levels in the eyes. The Eye-Rite formula contains 100 mg of soy isoflavone concentrate based on a daily dosage of 2 capsules. Other beneficial nutrients in the formula include alpha-lipoic acid (an antioxidant, see  pp. 66-67), vitamins C and E, zinc, and spirulina algae.<p>

<b>THERAPEUTIC CANCER VACCINE BASED ON PLACENTAL EXTRACTS</b><p>
While the emphasis in alternative cancer treatment, in terms of understanding how cancer develops and how to reverse it, has been to strengthen a patient's presumably weakened immune system, Russian immunologist Valentin I. Govallo proposed in the late 1970s that the solution might lie elsewhere. Dr. Govallo, a physician and immunologist working in Moscow, proposed that the secret to reversing cancer might lie in disabling the immune system of the tumor itself. <p>
Dr. Govallo developed a therapeutic vaccine, now called VG-1000, based on extracts of human placentas obtained after a normal pregnancy (but never an abortion). Between 1975 and 1996, Dr. Govallo tested the vaccine on 250 patients, most of whom had supposedly incurable cancers. He reports today that more than 50% of his earliest patients have survived 10 years or more and have healthy immune systems. Typically, a patient needs only 2 injections, spaced 1 week apart, followed by a booster shot 1-2 months later.<p>
Dr. Govallo's placental vaccine, which prior to 1996 was virtually unknown outside Russia, is now available in North America at 2 alternative cancer clinics: Max Gerson Memorial Center Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, and Immuno-Augmentative Clinic (IAT) in Freeport, Bahamas. <p>
The arrival of VG-1000 in North America was made possible by the efforts of medical historian Harris L. Coulter, Ph.D., director of the Center for Empirical Medicine in Washington, D.C. Dr. Coulter is the author of the landmark 4-volume Divided Legacy, a 3,000-page work documenting the history of and conflicts between conventional and alternative medicines. In 1994, Dr. Coulter traveled to Moscow, met with Dr. Govallo, and made arrangements to introduce VG-1000 in the West.<p>
According to Dr. Coulter, VG-1000 is indicated as "the first-line treatment" for all carcinomas (breast, prostate, and lung cancers) and melanomas, especially if they have been recently diagnosed. "It is also recommended for persons whose cancers have apparently been treated with success in the past but who are concerned about relapse." <p>
Dr. Coulter notes that patients with early stage cancers who have had their primary tumor surgically removed and who have not had either radiation or chemotherapy "respond extremely well." For those who have already had conventional treatments, a 2-month waiting period is advised before using VG-1000. <p>
The vaccine is contraindicated for liver cancer or metastases to the bones since the liver will be unable to process toxins released by the dying tumor. Generally, preliminary surgery to minimize the cancer mass is advised so that the burden on the liver to detoxify the dissolving tumor does not become formidable.<p>
The vaccine "apparently kills" the tumor by suppressing then removing its defense mechanism, says Dr. Coulter. As Dr. Govallo theorized, the tumor appears able to selectively disable the immune response of the patient in a manner similar to the way a fetus keeps its mother's immune system from rejecting it. Dr. Govallo argues that, in the early stages of a cancer, the patient's immunity may actually be normal, except that its antitumor mechanisms have been blocked by the tumor itself.<p>
By applying these immunological principles, Dr. Govallo achieved a 91% normal birth rate among women with a history of multiple miscarriages. Although the precise mode of action is not completely understood, it appears that the placental vaccine breaks through the tumor's "shield," neutralizes its blockers, and renders it vulnerable to the body's immune actions, which begin to literally soften then dissolve it, said Dr. Govallo. <p>
For example, when 2 patients with long-standing lung cancer received a VG-1000 injection, within a few days their tumors began to "melt" and be expelled in little clumps through the mouth by coughing. Patients with cancer of the colon and prostate similarly noticed strange deposits of foreign, dead matter in their stool and urine soon after having the vaccine. <p>
Dr. Coulter notes that patients often have strong reactions to the injection—transient symptoms such as sleepiness, headaches, depression, fever, sweats, chills, pain twinges—which indicate a positive, "curative" response. Patients tend to experience other benefits as well, such as mood elevation, pain reduction, and life extension even in cancers at the most advanced stage. Dr. Coulter notes that while there is much to be encouraged about regarding the clinical performance of VG-1000, it is still "premature" to say the substance can or cannot "cure" cancer. Patients interested in receiving VG-1000 treatment must be screened for suitability, says Dr. Coulter.<p>

<b>AID FOR DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS<br>
Versatile Antioxidant from Potatoes</b><p>
Some of the blood sugar and energy problems associated with diabetes may be relieved with a substance found principally in potatoes, but also in carrots, yams, sweet potatoes, and red meat. First identified in 1957, it's called alpha-lipoic acid (also known as thioctic acid) and while it is naturally present in the body where it assists in the conversion of foods into energy, its benefits to the body are much enhanced when it is taken as a supplement. <p>
Prominent among these benefits is the way alpha-lipoic acid can aid in diabetes. Physicians in Germany have been prescribing alpha-lipoic acid for the last 30 years to help patients with adult-onset diabetes control their blood sugar. Researchers showed that this substance, when intravenously administered at a dose of 1000 mg, can increase the uptake and utilization of blood sugar (glucose) by over 50%, thereby decreasing the dependency on the pancreatic hormone insulin to do the same job. In short, alpha-lipoic acid was able to normalize blood sugar levels.<p>
Adult-onset diabetes is often characterized by too much unutilized glucose (high blood sugar); therefore, alpha-lipoic acid shows promise for long-term management of this condition. Other studies have shown that diabetics tend to have lower than normal amounts of bodily alpha-lipoic acid and that taking supplemental alpha-lipoic acid can return these levels to normal. <p>
It can also lower insulin resistance, a condition in which the body does not react to insulin, allowing blood sugar levels to climb. Supplemen-tation at the rate of 300-600 mg daily has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar levels and increase energy storage (glycogen) and availability in muscles, liver, and the brain. Supplementation at the rate of 600 mg daily for 1 month resulted in a 55% to 72% increase in levels of 2 biochemical substances central to memory and brain energy. Alpha-lipoic acid also helps reduce glycation, the damage caused by blood sugar to protein and other important substances.<p>
Diabetics are often vulnerable to nerve damage (neuropathy) as a complication, but here, again, German research shows that those at risk who take 600 mg of alpha-lipoic acid daily can significantly reduce the symptoms of this condition, enhance regeneration of damaged nerves, and increase nerve blood flow. <p>
Alpha-lipoic acid may also be able to protect the eyes against cataracts, another common diabetic complication. Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley showed that in newborn rats with induced cataracts, a dose of 25 mg/2.5 pounds of body weight of alpha-lipoic acid protected about 60% of the rats from actual cataract formation.<p>
Alpha-lipoic acid can also protect the eyes against another condition called macular degeneration (see pp. 63-65). Here the substance demonstrates its versatility as an antioxidant, or free radical scavenger, because macular denegeration has been linked to inadequate blood levels of antioxidants. Alpha-lipoic acid is unique among antioxidants for being able to enter both the fat-soluble and water-soluble parts of the cell to neutralize free radicals. Among other antioxidants, vitamin C can address only the water-soluble and vitamin E the fat-soluble components of cells. <p>
Studies show that alpha-lipoic acid can actually penetrate eye tissue and protect both the lens and retina from degeneration. Even better, alpha-lipoic acid appears capable of regenerating vitamins C and E, coenzyme Q10, and glutathione, prolonging their antioxidant activity in the body. <p>
Further, it is an important player in an "antioxidant network" that includes vitamins C and E and glutathione and enables these 3 to function more efficiently. Alpha-lipoic acid also is a highly effective liver detoxifier, able to reverse liver damage (when administered at 800 mg in 4 divided doses) caused by ingesting poisonous mushrooms and in cases of sudden liver failure.<p>
Generally, dosages are about 50 mg daily for antioxidant benefits (based on German usage), but far higher amounts are typically used for diabetes and other conditions. Julian Whitaker, M.D., who practices in Newport Beach, California, suggests that until more is known about alpha-lipoic acid's actions, its use as a supplement, at 50-200 mg daily, should be "only for people who are under treatment for diabetes, heart disease, AIDS, and any form of serious liver disorder." <p>
