<h1><a href="ftfjun96.htm#In This Issue . . ." name="Why Switch?"><b>Why
Switch?</b> </a></h1>

<p><b>Suppose 30 years ago you were given $20,000. . .</b> </p>

<p>. . . Being a Farsighted individual you invested in the stock
market. Today you'd be rich&#151;right? </p>

<p><b>WRONG! </b>The truth is you'd be worse off than if you had
invested the same amount in T-Bills! </p>

<p>How can this be? Aren't we in the biggest Bull market ever? </p>

<p>The reason is simple. Bear markets can wipe out years of gains
in months! If you lose 20% on a $10,000 investment one year
(bringing it down to $8,000). You need a 25% gain the next year
just to break even! ($2,000 is 25% of $8,000.) To make matters
worse, now you have not earned a cent on your money in two years! </p>

<p>As we can see from this chart, even with the explosive growth
of the last few years, <b>buy and hold doesn't work</b>. No
matter what the brokerage industry and the establishment news
media tell us, since 1966 the stock market has not even kept up
with T-Bills! </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftfjun1.gif"
alt="NYSE vs. T-Bills 1966-1996" width="640" height="437"> </p>

<p><b>BUT WAIT&#151;</b>The truth is even worse! After adjusting
for inflation we see the true picture (see the chart on the next
page), the stock market not only didn't keep up with T-Bills, but
for the entire period from 1966 through 1992 you would not have
earned a single cent after inflation. </p>

<p>To add insult to injury&#151;that is before taxes! After you
pay taxes on the imaginary (inflation) gains you would have a
tremendous <b>LOSS!</b> </p>

<p>So what can we do? Isn't this the only game in town? </p>

<h2><a href="ftfjun96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Timing&#151;The Better Way">Timing&#151;The Better Way</a></h2>

<p>The chart on the next page shows the results if you had
followed the most simple switching technique available, the
moving average. </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftfjun2.gif"
alt="NYSE vs. T-Bills 1966-1996 (Inflation Adjusted)" width="640"
height="437"> </p>

<p>By selling your stocks whenever the stock price fell below the
6 month moving average and buying T-Bills, you could improve your
overall performance by almost 30%. </p>

<p><b><i>Yes, your total assets are almost 1/3 larger by
following the most basic timing method available.</i></b> </p>

<p><b>By Simply:</b> </p>

<ol>
    <li>looking at the newspaper once a month </li>
    <li>calculating the average price over the last six months </li>
    <li>Checking which was higher&#151;the average or the current
        market price. </li>
    <li>Switching your investments an average of 1 ½ times per
        year </li>
</ol>

<p><b>You could increase your total assets by almost 1/3 !</b> </p>

<p>This simple timing method allows us to avoid the latter
portion of dips and level periods. </p>

<p>This is the most simple timing method available. If you were
able to use more advanced techniques, such as our Relative
Strength Index and Ratios, you could increase your holdings even
more! </p>

<p>Since this is such a powerful and universally applicable
technique, beginning next month we will be including the moving
averages for the NYSE. Currently the Index is well above its
moving average as we can see in the Advantages of Switching
chart. </p>

<h2><a href="ftfjun96.htm#In This Issue . . ." name="The FED">The
FED</a></h2>

<p>The Fed chided Clinton for trying to influence it with his
public remarks against raising rates. The Fed said the remarks
could only be harmful because they might spook the market into
thinking the Central Bank could be pressured into accepting
higher inflation. The Central Bank also indicated that they did
not feel inflation pressures were building yet but that &quot;we
are getting close.&quot; (This is what we have been saying for
the last month or so.) </p>

<p>The PPI declined .1% in May but Bond investors are following
labor markets and ignoring the facts that although energy prices
rose 2.4% in March and 2.8% in April they fell .6% in May, Food
prices also remained level in May. </p>

<h2><a href="ftfjun96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Quotes of the Month">Quotes of the Month</a></h2>

<p>&quot;With the economy expected to expand at about 2.5% this
year we are close to the limit before inflation kicks in.&quot;
according to the Chicago Federal Reserve Chairman. </p>

<p>&quot;We seem to be getting growth without inflation, which
most economists find terrific but baffling&quot; said the chief
economist of Scudder, Stevens and Clark of New York. </p>

<p>It amazes me that these supposedly educated economists somehow
believe that growth in the economy creates inflation. It is not
baffling at all. </p>

<p>Basic economics tells us that the GNP could double and not
cause a single bit of inflation as long as the money supply
increased less. The whole key to price inflation is when the
money supply expands faster than the GNP. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the money supply is much more difficult to
track than the available M1, M2 and M3 numbers would lead you to
believe. There is a vast quantity of unreported greenbacks
floating around the world. Fortunately, they usually have very
little effect upon our economy. It is only as they move back here
that they affect our prices. </p>

<p>It seems simple enough that if there are 10 items in our
&#147;economy&#148; and $10 to spend on them, the average price
per item will be $1.00. If the &#147;economy&#148; expands to 20
items without a corresponding increase in the money supply you
get deflation not inflation as the average price becomes 50. </p>

<p>If, however, the money supply doubles, then you get inflation
as prices go to $2. Naturally, the actual situation is much more
complex especially with the FED constantly adjusting interest
rates, etc., but I would think the basics would still apply. </p>

<p>This month the inflation rate was almost exactly the same as
last month&#151;down .01%). The MIP is predicting a flat to
moderate rise for the next few months with a much sharper rise in
the CPI-U numbers in the fourth quarter. This should result in an
increase in the price of Gold and a decrease in Bonds. </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftfjun5.gif"
alt="Ratio of Benham Gold vs. Bonds" width="640" height="437"></p>

<p>Last month, I said the 8 week crossing is rarely a false
signal. And on the rare occasion that it does retrace almost
always the true crossing occurs shortly ther?after. Well, we are
definitely on the down hill side now. </p>

<p>The four and eight week averages have turned down, the ratio
is firmly below both averages, and the four week crossed below
the eight week average giving us our final confirmation. We will
continue in bonds until the averages level out and we get the
ratio crossing through the 4 week average to the upside. </p>

<h2><a href="ftfjun96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Relative Strength Index (RSI)">Relative Strength Index
(RSI)</a></h2>

<p>The RSI is a moving &#147;momentum&#148; index that calculates
the exponential moving average of upticks versus downticks. This
is graphed on a range of 0-100% with dotted lines at 30%, 50% and
70%. At 70% the index is &#147;overbought&#148; (<i>i.e.,</i> too
high) and below 30% it is oversold (<i>i.e.,</i> too low) extreme
overbought and oversold situations usually require some time to
work themselves out. See <b>October 1995 FTF</b> for detailed
information on Relative Strength patterns and signals. </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftfjun6.gif" alt="Benham 2020 RSI"
width="582" height="470"></p>

<p>The Bond relative strength index is in the lower half showing
signs of gaining strength. This is good for bonds. As we can see
the RSI bottomed in late February and tested the oversold line
several times each while making lower lows in the price. The RSI,
however, was not making lower lows. This divergence is typical of
bottoms. With the most recent bottom in the RSI being only in the
40% range we are seeing signs of strength emerging. Depending on
whether the rise shows enough strength to cross the overbought
line, or only touch it will determine how long the uptrend will
last. </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftfjun7.gif" alt="Benham Gold RSI"
width="576" height="479"></p>

<p>We have had a 14.2% drop in the price of Benham Gold from a
high of $15.77 on February 5th to the low of $13.33 on June 17th
. With the RSI in extreme oversold territory some may see a
repeat of point &#147;A&#148; in the making. Even though our
Gold/Bond ratio is favoring Bonds the trend for inflation is
definitely up. </p>

<p><b>Cautious investors may wish to begin buying the dips in
Gold in case we get a repeat of last year's meteoric rise without
another major test of the oversold line.</b> </p>

<p>The normal rise pattern should be the reverse of the
&#147;B&#148;, &#147;C&#148;, &#147;D&#148; pattern, with several
tests of the oversold line with very little overall price
movement, before the actual rise begins. However, Gold often
reacts more violently than we would expect for other items. </p>

<p>Bonds are showing the beginnings of strength and should
continue to rise for a while. The Gold/Bond Ratio has turned to
favor Bonds while Gold is extremely weak. Those who wish to buy
into this weakness may begin to phase a small portion of their
funds into Gold. But we expect Bonds to outperform Gold for the
next couple of months. </p>

<p>The Platinum/Gold Ratio rose imperceptibly this month but
remains in the range where Platinum is undervalued compared to
Gold. For those who would like to begin accumulating metals you
may consider Lydenburg Platinum (LYDPY). Recently trading at a
price of $16¾ up from $13. In the last three years it has traded
as high as $23 and as low as $10 </p>

<p>The New York Stock Exchange Relative Strength Index is showing
a &#147;negative divergence&#148; in the trend lines (<i>i.e.,</i>
one is going up while the other is tending down). This is a
negative indicator. Point &#147;C&#148; indicates a reversal is
at hand. Hopefully, it will lead to higher highs. But with the
last peak barely above the 70% line, our peaks are getting
weaker. If we see another peak like points &#147;A&#148; and
&#147;B&#148; below the overbought line and no crossings above
the line we would be due for a correction. We hope this is just
&#147;Summer Doldrums&#148;. </p>

<p>For the very short term we should see another upward push
testing or crossing the overbought line. If that is strong enough
to break the down trending RSI the Bull can continue. </p>

<p>The Dollar is also showing signs of negative divergence with
point &#147;A&#148; and &#147;B&#148; performing weaker than
previous peaks. This upthrust may be the final push for the
Dollar. It is possible we have seen the top for the Greenback. </p>

<h2><a href="ftfjun96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Microsoft Update">Microsoft Update</a></h2>

<p>Back in our August 1995 issue we began coverage of Microsoft
with the following highlighted quotation <b>&#147;I believe
Microsoft will trade up to its old highs and above within months
of the release of Windows 95 in Late August.&#148; B</b>y the
time that issue reached you Microsoft was trading in the Low
90's. The &#147;old highs&#148; mentioned were at $110. In the
same issue we said <b>&#147;Plan on taking Profits when Microsoft
reaches $120.&#148; </b>MSFT is now trading at $121 so it is time
to consider taking those profits. </p>

<p>It took a couple of months longer than expected but for those
of you who followed that advice and bought at $92 you are up
about 35% in 10 months! There were opportunities to buy at lower
prices along the way but to buy at those points takes a
psychological will of steel. Often when it is most difficult to
buy is when we should be buying. </p>

<p>We also offered a trading strategy for Microsoft as it traded
in a wide range from $90-$100. It was possible to buy at $90 and
sell at $100 several times in a three or four month period giving
us another way to pick up 30% on Microsoft in the last year! </p>

<p>Two other interesting High Tech stocks are Iomega (IOMG) and
Syquest (SYQT). Both manufacture hardware for backing up computer
hard drives. Earlier this year both traded in the single digits.
Then Iomega announced a breakthrough technology supposed to
revolutionize the industry. Iomega stock shot up to $55 with a
P/E of 200+ while Syquest fell to around $4 with a P/E of 2! This
is a perfect example of market stupidity! Syquest is still
undervalued at $9. While Iomega is still overvalued at $30 (P/E
of 188). I would not be surprised to see them both trade at $18
within the next year. </p>

<h2><a href="ftfjun96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Reading The MIP Chart">Reading The MIP Chart</a></h2>

<p>The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is an extremely
accurate predictor of inflation. It accurately forecasts
direction changes a year in advance. </p>

<p>The vertical axis is the inflation rate (in percent) while the
horizontal axis is the date. </p>

<p>The left side of the chart is the historical Consumer Price
Index (CPI). The right side is the predicted CPI. </p>

<p>The right side consists of several diverging lines starting at
a &quot;You are here&quot; arrow. The median line is the most
likely prediction for the future of the CPI with likely highs and
lows diverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. </p>

<p><b>By focusing on the median line you can easily see changes
in the direction of the CPI index.</b> </p>

<p>An increase in the CPI usually translates into an increase in
Gold and Gold Stocks. </p>

<p>A decrease in the CPI index usually indicates a decrease in
Gold and an increase in Bonds, Utilities and other interest
sensitive instruments. </p>

<p><b>CPI UP = GOLD UP</b> </p>

<p><b>CPI DOWN=BONDS UP</b> </p>

<h2>CPI Data-</h2>

<p>By annualizing the CPI Data from various time spans we can get
an idea of the likely range over the next year's time frame. Keep
in mind that 1 and 2 month rates have very little long-term
significance. </p>

<h2>The Basic Portfolio</h2>

<p>The simplest portfolio uses the Benham Family. We chose Benham
for 3 reasons. </p>

<ol>
    <li>It has a good Gold Fund. </li>
    <li>It has a long-term Bond Fund that moves rapidly and
        provides the greatest upside potential during up moves. </li>
    <li>It has several alternatives for parking funds during
        periods of uncertainty. </li>
</ol>

<p>Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham Gold
Equity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. </p>

<h2>New Money</h2>

<p>Any funds recently freed up should follow the &quot;New
Money&quot; indicator. </p>

<h2>Volatility</h2>

<p>Our greatest ally and biggest foe is volatility. We rely upon
large changes in the prices of our funds during relatively short
periods of time. This can result in short term losses if we
switch directions too early. This is referred to as &quot;draw
down&quot; <i>i.e.,</i> in the long run we made money but in the
mean time our account showed a temporary paper loss. Some
investors have difficulty handling large draw downs. They should
follow the conservative approach. </p>

<h2>Diversification</h2>

<p>All investors should diversify by investing a portion of their
portfolio using several other investment approaches including
well selected individual securities, mutual funds and other
appropriate investments. Our goal is to maximize overall
portfolio performance with a minimum of risk. </p>

<h2>Insurance Gold</h2>

<p>Every investor should have a portion (usually 10-15% or 1
years living expenses) of their assets in Gold and/or Silver
(coins and/or bullion). This should be considered insurance
against market chaos and is not an investment. The cost of this
insurance is the missed interest. </p>

<h2>Relative Strength</h2>

<p>Relative Strength Indices (RSI) provide advance warning of
prices that are very overbought (too high) or very oversold (too
low). Certain patterns also indicate a coming increase or
decrease in prices. Relative Strength is very sensitive and often
provides very early signals (sometimes too early). </p>

<h2>Ratios</h2>

<p>A ratio is simply one item divided by another. By tracking a
Ratio we can watch both items of the Ratio simultaneously. When
the ratio is rising Item 1 is outperforming Item 2. By switching
between the items we can profit continuously. It doesn't matter
whether one item is rising, or both items are rising or falling.
as long as we increase the number of shares we hold with each
switch. In the long run we will multiply our wealth.</p>

<h2><b>Aggressive Portfolio</b> </h2>

<p>(Stocks Based on RSI) </p>

<h3><b>Stock Portfolio</b> </h3>

<p>Buy 1/2 CDE on 9/15 @ 20 7/8 </p>

<p>Sell on 1/29/96 @ $22.75 </p>

<p>Buy 1/2 ECO on 9/15 @ 11 1/8 </p>

<p>Sell on 1/29/96 @ $12.75 </p>

<p>Buy 1/2 AAN.F on 1/29/96 @$83 </p>

<p>Buy 1/2 Hechinger 9.45's of 2012 @ $71 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Conservative Portfolio</b> </h2>

<p>(Mutual Funds Based on Moving Average) </p>

<p>Buy Benham 2020 May 1 @ $21.10. </p>
