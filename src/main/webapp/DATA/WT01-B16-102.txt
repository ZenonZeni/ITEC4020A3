<H3>The UK Nuclear Review: a Perspective by Nuclear Electric. John Coffey and
Graham Oates.</H3>
<P>


In 1989 the UK government withdrew nuclear from the electricity privatisation
programme, seeing it as too great an investment risk, and created Nuclear Electric
plc and Scottish Nuclear Ltd as publicly owned companies to own and operate
nuclear power stations. A moratorium on new nuclear stations was instituted, not
including Sizewell B.<P>

Since 1989 privatisation of the rest of the UK electricity supply industry has
continued, subjecting nuclear to a competitive market. Continued operation of
Magnox and AGR stations was accepted as economically justified; Nuclear Electric's
performance improved with output up by 43% by 1989, market share up from 16.7%
to 23.2% and unit cost down to 2.6p/kWh for AGR. Sizewell B was built to schedule
and budget; progress was made, through negotiations with BNFL and UK Nirex
Ltd, regarding spent fuel management and waste disposal. The Fossil Fuel Levy
was instituted and distributed to non-fossil electricity generators, and is used by
Nuclear Electric to meet its inherited liabilities.<P>

The Nuclear Review is seen as deciding the future of nuclear electricity generation
in the UK. The Review, conducted by the DTI, will examine commercial viability of
new nuclear power stations and whether they offer diversity, security of supply and
environmental benefits; options for private sector finance; how best to manage
waste disposal and decommissioning; and levy arrangements. The nuclear
generators have already published their case.<P>

Nuclear Electric's priority is for privatisation, so that it can have full commercial
freedom without government intervention, and can raise private finance (public
funds not being available) to invest in assets to replace Magnox stations, which are
not regarded as fully privatisable. Privatisation's advantages include possible cost
savings on contracts with BNFL, gaining better value for the taxpayer and
consumer.<P>

Nuclear Electric also favours construction of new nuclear plant. Commercial risks
are thought least for a new station based on the Sizewell design (a twin PWR
'Sizewell C', cost œ3.5 billion). A paradox in UK energy policy is pointed out, in that
the government looks to market forces to bring about its energy policy aims of
secure, diverse supplies of affordable electricity, but does not recognise nuclear's
environmental and diversity benefits overtly in the price structure of the electricity
market.<P>

Nuclear Electric believes that both its aims and those of the government can be met
given the political will.<P>
