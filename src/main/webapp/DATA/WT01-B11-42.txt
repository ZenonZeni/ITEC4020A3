The <A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> debut in racing was very strong when
on August 21, 1968, a Cosmo 110S finished fourth at the gruelling 'Ring.
A second Cosmo lost a rear wheel and crashed.  The cars were powered by
10A engines that had been modified with both peripheral and side intake
ports, producing 130 bhp at 7000 rpm.

<H2> Federation International de L'Automobile </H2>

<P> Production Cars (Group N), Touring Cars (Group A) and Grand Touring
Cars (Group B) may run rotary engines.  <A HREF =
"http://www2.fia.com/fia/regle/reg_tec/252-a.htm">Article 252</A> states
"The equivalent cubic capacity is 1.5 times the volume determined by the
difference between the maximum and minimum capacities of the combustion
chamber."

<H2> Rally Racing </H2>

<P> Malcolm Smith and Jack Sreenan won Mazda's first pro rally in 1975
at the SCCA Mojave 24 Hour Rally.  The vehicle was the Rotary Pickup
truck sponsored by Alaskan Brand.

<H2> Midget Racing </H2>

<P> Drew Fornoro drove Gene Angelillo's upright midget powered by a 13B
to the North East Midget Racing Association (NEMA) championship in 1985.
Racing officials decided to handicap the rotary engine and restricted it
to a 12A.  They won again in 1986 in a lay-down midget.  The association
decided to bar rotary combustion engines from competition, claiming they
had no way to measure it.
