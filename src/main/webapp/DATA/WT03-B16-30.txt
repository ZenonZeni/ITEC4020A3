<h4>Improving value in worldwide benefits provision</h4>

<p>For many multinational companies, worldwide benefit programmes represent a significant proportion of their corporate assets and operating costs. An increasing number are recognising that relatively small reductions in benefit costs - achieved without necessarily reducing benefit levels - can have dramatic effects on the financial results of their business. Broadly, these companies are ensuring that:

<ul>
<li>their international bulk purchasing power and volume of aggregate benefit assets are used effectively
<li>their spending is tightly targeted to achieve good 'value for money'
<li>their resources are centralised, rationalised and achieving synergy.
</ul>
<p>Examples of measures that these companies are taking are discussed below.
<p><b>Alignment of benefit programmes with business and HR objectives.</b> Remuneration and benefit programmes need to support business and HR objectives. This alignment can be achieved by conducting an audit of existing programmes against business objectives and employee needs. This then identifies priorities for change, where necessary.
<p>Benefit programmes that send conflicting messages to employees are being realigned to support other initiatives such as performance management, flexible working practices and competency-based pay.
<p><b>Global benefits management.</b> A number of companies are examining ways to manage benefits more effectively on a worldwide basis. Trends include:

<ul>
<li>centralising those responsibilities and key high-level functions that have traditionally been delegated to local operations
<li>outsourcing functions, such as benefits administration, that can be undertaken more cost-effectively by an external provider.
</ul>

<p><b>Use of a global actuarial adviser.</b> Increasingly, multinational companies are appointing a single global actuarial firm to advise both headquarters and local management because doing so:

<ul>
<li>ensures consistent, cost-effective and high-quality advice to both sets of management
<li>enables the adviser to tailor its advice to the worldwide needs of the company and to detect potential conflict early on.
</ul>

<p><b>Global pension asset management.</b> As a rule of thumb, an increase in investment return on pension assets of 1% pa implies a 15% reduction in ongoing costs. Opportunities for more effective asset management can be achieved by headquarters management:

<ul>
<li>issuing investment guidelines with which local managers must comply, and/or
<li>appointing one or two preferred investment managers to manage the retirement assets of the organisation's international subsidiaries.
</ul>

<p><b>Multinational pooling of insured benefits.</b> A number of multinational organisations still do not take advantage of their bulk buying power when they buy benefits insurance. Multi-national pooling can achieve cost-savings of up to 25% each year on worldwide employee benefit insurance premiums. 

<p>Organisations that have implemented the above measures have realised significant savings and/or identified opportunities to offer better value in their benefits provision for the money they are currently spending.

<h4> Pension law demands action </h4>

The Royal Decree relating to the pension law of 6 April 1995 (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9506.html#be">June</a> and <a href="9512.html#be">December 1995</a>) was finally signed on 10 January 1996. It confirms that the transitional period for the formal adaptation of the plan rules and other documents to the new law will end on 31 December 1998. However, a more stringent provision has been added at the last minute: employers must, during the first half of 1996, inform plan members in writing of the effect that the new law has on their rights. The contents of this document may be general in nature and do not have to be personalised.
<p>Employers will also have to:

<ul>
<li>incorporate the Barber judgment into their plans as soon as possible, if they have not already done so (because of the levelling-up associated with Barber, each day of postponement costs money)
<li>apply all other provisions of the new law and its Royal Decree with retroactive effect from 1 January 1996 (the key provisions concern plan entry and termination of employment)
<li>consult the works council or, in its absence, the health and safety committee on plan changes (if neither of these bodies exists, the employees themselves need to be informed before changes are made).
</ul>

<p>Provisions concerning transfer values remain as set out in the draft Decree: with few exceptions, they may not be any lower than the legally required minimum reserves. 

<p>In contrast, the provision relat ing to past service in the case of plan modification has been significantly diluted. The Royal Decree now states that the reserve attributable to service prior to any such modification may not be lower than one based on:

<ul>
<li>the old benefit formula
<li>the salary at the time the plan is modified (the draft Royal Decree proposed the use of salary at retirement or earlier termination).
</ul>

<p>This is the good news. The bad news is that the Royal Decree confirms that the actuarial basis to calculate reserves and, by analogy, transfer values and lump sum payments in lieu of pensions must be specified in the plan rules. The implication is that each change of the actuarial assumptions, including the adoption of a new commutation discount rate, is in fact a plan modification subject to the same minimum past service provision as all other plan modifications (see above).

<h4> INPDAI will not be privatised </h4>

<p>Employers need to monitor developments concerning INPDAI (the pension scheme for industrial sector managers) now that the decision to privatise it has been reversed. In particular, INPDAI may now be affected by the far-reaching changes to the social security system (INPS) implemented in August last year (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9510.html#it">October 1995</a>). 

<p>The following questions arise:

<ul>
<li>Will INPDAI, in the same way as INPS, now need to be converted to a 'contributory method' benefit accrual system?
<li>Will the cap on earnings (of ItL132,000,000, or approximately US$80,000) for pension purposes be imposed? If so, the cap will apply to most future INPDAI members who, by definition, are managers and are likely to earn in excess of ItL132,000,000.
<li>Will the maximum benefit from INPDAI continue to accrue over 30 years, when the accrual period for INPS is 40 years?
</ul>

<p>In particular, employers should consider how their managers' expected benefit levels will be affected.

<h4> Problems continue for pension funds</h4>

<p>Although deregulation is under way, companies continue to face challenges in relation to pension funds - qualified pension plans (QPPs) and employee pension funds (EPFs):

<ul>
<li>Unrealised capital losses on funds invested with trust banks are 13.5% on average.
<li>The guaranteed interest rate on funds invested in life insurance company general accounts - which was reduced in April 1994 to 4.5% from 5.5% - is likely to be further reduced to about 2.5% in April 1996. Allowing for tax of 1.173% and administration charges, the outlook for QPP general account returns under current investment approaches is only 1% or 2% per year.
<li>Japanese pension funds are under-weight in equities (25%) and over-weight in bonds (70%), even though bond yields are at historical lows.
<li>Fund managers still tend to focus on limiting the downside - investing heavily in domestic fixed interest instruments yielding only 1% or 2% - notwithstanding final pay-related liabilities growing at 4% or 5% per year.
</ul>

<p>Recent investment returns on EPFs were as follows:

<p>On the brighter side, plan sponsors are taking much more interest in how their pension funds are invested, and some fund managers are eager to implement asset allocation guidelines that are structured to achieve the sponsors' investment objectives and risk return preferences. A key part of the solution is to shift into higher yielding equities. Over the past 25 to 30 years, Japanese equities have out-performed bonds by more than 3.0% per year.

<p>In addition, market value accounting will be introduced for EPFs from 1997, and they will be required to have formal investment policy statements from April 1996. The application of international accounting standards that measure assets at market value and liabilities on more realistic assumptions than under the current statutory method is also anticipated in Japan in the near future. However, the Government intends to reduce the tax-deductibility of book reserved retirement liabilities - internal financing - putting more pressure to improve re-turns on externally funded plans.

<h4> General Survivor's Pension Act revised</h4>

<p>The Dutch Parliament finally passed the new General Survi-vor's Pension Act (ANW) on 
19 December 1995. The Act introduces far-reaching changes to State-provided benefits for 
widows and widowers and will take effect from 1 July 1996. Employers should consider whether or not these changes - which mainly affect eligibility conditions - should be compensated for by additional benefits from the employers' pension plans.

<p>The main provisions of the Act are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Three categories are eligible for benefit:
	<ul><li>survivors with children under the age of 18
	- <li>survivors who are disabled
	- <li>survivors born before 1950.</ul>
<li>The maximum amount of benefit payable will be 70% of the net statutory minimum wage; it will also be means-tested.
<li>Survivors with children under the age of 18 will receive an extra benefit of 20% of the net statutory minimum wage, irrespective of their income.
<li>Orphans in full-time education will receive benefit until they reach the age of 21, instead of 27 as previously.
<li>Registered cohabiting partners will be entitled to benefit under the same rules as widows and widowers.
</ul>

<p>The estimated drop in the number of eligible survivors will be from the current 200,000 to 15,000.

<h4> Disclosure rules to be tightened </h4>

<p>Legislation to enact proposals to improve disclosure of savings and investment products, in-cluding corporate superannuation schemes, is currently being considered by a parliamentary select committee. If adopted, the expected implementation date will be 1 January 1997.

<p>The proposals are contained in a Government working paper which recommends that all savings and investment providers should give full details of their products to the public. The paper suggests that an investor or saver should receive comparable information whether they wish to invest in a unit trust, life policy or corporate superannuation scheme. The information should include answers to questions such as:

<ul>
<li>What sort of investment is this?
<li>What returns will I get?
<li>What are my risks?
</ul>

<p>A more detailed document - a prospectus - should be available on request.

<p>Under the proposed new regime, trustees of corporate superannuation schemes would have to provide new members with an investment statement with a standardised content. Small schemes would be exempt from the prospectus requirements.

<h4><a name="nz2"> Human rights guidelines published</a></h4>

<p>The commission that administers the Human Rights Act 1993 has finally published guidelines about how the Act applies to superannuation schemes. The guidelines are less stringent than had been feared by many commentators; for example, a scheme's disability income benefit can offset any benefits received from the State. The Act prohibits discrimination on a variety of grounds ranging from gender, age and disability to sexual orientation and marital status. The deadline of 31 December 1995 for amendment to existing schemes has been extended by two months. Trustees need to advise the Government Actuary that they have received independent legal advice that their scheme complies with the legislation. Although there are no specific penalties for non-compliance, the commission will probably directly approach any scheme that fails to comply.

<p>Copies of the guidelines are available from Mark Weaver on the number below.

<h2><a name="za"> SOUTH AFRICA </A></H2>
<h4> Retirement benefit provision policy in the spotlight </h4>

<p>Employers will need to consider their future retirement benefit strategy to take account of the reports of two Government-appointed commissions of inquiry released in December 1995. These hold significant implications for the future development of retirement benefit provision philosophy and policy in South Africa. The more important issues are summarised below.

<p><b>Katz Commission report.</b><br>
The third interim report of the Katz Commission, which is considering the taxation system in South Africa, was released on 5 December 1995. Previous recommendations of the commission concerning the taxation of retirement funds had met with some criticism (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9412.html#za">December 1994</a> and <a href="9502.html#za">February 1995</a>), and the commission was asked by the Standing Committee on Finance to consider these further. The principal recommendations of the current report are: 

<ul>
<li>Defined benefit schemes were singled out for special consideration in terms of the deductibility provisions, but no specific details were provided.
<li>Separate deductibility limits should be set for benefit funds and medical schemes. These deductions would be allowed over and above retirement fund deductions.
<li>All benefits arising on the death, retirement or other termination of service of a member, whether in lump sum or annuity form, should be treated as a single lump sum for taxation purposes. This means that the lump sum equivalent (or capital value) of a pension benefit should be added to the amount of any lump sum, and the total taxed at the point of exit from membership in accordance with the following provisions: 
		<ul><li>The minimum tax-exempt amount on death or retirement would be SAR50,000. To encourage people to take pensions instead of a lump sum, a greater amount would be tax-exempt if an annuity were to be selected, with a maximum tax-exempt amount of SAR380,000. The tax-exempt amount on resignation would be SAR2,000.
		<li>The taxable amount of the total capital value should be taxed on a sliding scale, depending on the amount of the net capital value. The sliding scale would be more penal for resignation benefits than for death and retirement benefits.</ul>
<li>Tax exemptions on lump sum benefits payable from public sector retirement funds should be withdrawn, and compliance with deductibility provisions should also be enforced. Accrued rights should, however, be recognised.
</ul>

<p>The proposals will undoubtedly generate much reaction and debate, but appear to offer a better framework than the original ill-defined proposals a year ago. Some of the proposals could potentially be incorporated into the budget in March 1996, but given their far-reaching implications, and the recommendation of the Smith Committee (see below), it may still be some time before major changes are made.
<p><b>Smith Committee report. </b><br>
The Smith Committee, instructed to 'inquire into the efficacy and efficiency of the present retirement arrangements and to make recommendations for improvement', reported on 15 December 1995. The committee adopted a more cautious approach than the Katz Commission. Its primary recommendation is for the formation of a National Retirement Provision Forum which will establish retirement provision policy by considering an initial draft policy framework based on the recommendations of the committee itself. Such a process is likely to be lengthy.

<p>Other major recommendations of the committee are:

<ul>
<li>Personal provision should form the greatest part of retirement provision, and the Government should embark on a marketing campaign to emphasise the success of the retirement fund movement in South Africa and to make voluntary personal provision the cornerstone of retirement funding.
<li>Retirement benefits that yield income are preferable to lump sum benefits.
<li>Preservation and portability of benefits should be facilitated and encouraged.
<li>The administration and management of the current Old Age Assistance System should be enhanced.
<li>Public sector retirement provision should be carefully assessed, particularly issues such as the funding of benefits, equality of treatment between the public and private sectors, and the extent and nature of benefits provided.
</ul>

<h4> Tax-deductible limit raised for qualified pension plans</h4>

<p>After pressure from the opposition parties, the Government has raised the annual tax-deductible limit for qualified pension plans from Pts750,000 to Pts1,000,000, with effect from 1 January 1996. This now makes the tax-deductible limit the same as the maximum contribution limit, which was increased from Pts750,000 to Pts1,000,000 under the new Insurance Law which was passed on 9 November 1995 (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9512.html#es">December 1995</a>).

<p>If the tax-deductibility had been maintained at its previous level of Pts750,000, it would have been unlikely that anyone would contribute the additional Pts250,000 allowable, since it would be paid for out of net income, but taxed as gross income when it was received as a benefit payment.

<p>Raising the tax-deductible limit further reinforces the position of qualified pension plans as the principal vehicle for private pension provision.

<h2><a name="uk"> UNITED KINGDOM </A></H2>
<h4> Works councils proliferate</h4>

<p>An increasing number of major UK companies, including BT, Coats Viyella, Courtaulds, GKN, ICI, Pilkington, and United Biscuits, are introducing EU-style works councils. The largest banking and insurance employers are also likely to follow suit. In theory, the UK's opt-out of the Social Chapter means that UK companies do not have to comply with the Works Council Directive. In practice, however, many UK companies are deciding to give their UK employees the same consultation rights as their continental European counterparts. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has calculated that over 100 UK-based international companies fall within the terms of the Directive, and it expects all of them to establish works councils for their UK staff.

<p>Under the Directive, companies with at least 1,000 staff within member states (excluding the UK) and with at least 150 staff in each or two (or more) member states (excluding the UK) must create consultation and information committees for employees. Companies in other member states have until 22 September 1996, when the Directive comes into effect (except in the UK), to negotiate works councils in the way that best suits their needs.

<h4><a name="uk2">New 'company share option plans' introduced in budget</a></h4>

<p>In the wake of the publication of the Greenbury Report on Directors' Remuneration (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9508.html#uk">August 1995</a>) in July, the British Government removed income tax relief on share options granted after 17 July 1995. At the time, there was some criticism of this move, on the grounds that it penalised middle managers and other staff, but did not in practice affect higher-earning executive directors, who were the subject of the Greenbury Report.

<p>In response, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed in the budget at the end of November 1995 new, income tax exempt 'company share option plans' or 'CSOPs'. These plans will enable companies to grant options over shares with a value of up to £20,000 to employees. If the plan is approved by the Inland Revenue, there will be no income tax to pay either when the options are granted or when they are exercised. 

<p>The £20,000 ceiling applies to all the unexercised options held, and their value is based on the price of the shares at the time they are granted. There are separate transitional arrangements for companies that wish to convert their pre-July 1995 approved plans into the new CSOPs.

<p>The budget also introduced measures which make tax-relieved all-employee share schemes more flexible. The two types of approved plans are save-as-you-earn (SAYE) option plans and profit-sharing plans.

<p>In addition to the existing five- and seven-year savings contracts available in SAYE schemes, a new three-year contract will be introduced. The minimum savings amount has been halved to £5 a month, and it will also be possible to operate SAYE schemes in conjunction with an employee share ownership trust. 

<p>For profit-sharing schemes, the period that shares must be held in trust to gain tax relief has been reduced from five to three years. Shares must be held in trust for two years, and if the shares are sold after two years but before the end of year three, there will be an income tax charge on 100% of the value of the shares.
