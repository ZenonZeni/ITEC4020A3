<i><u>Professor A.H. Abdelmessih</u></i><p>
     Direct Digital Control of Large Air Conditioning System: The formulation of suitable
mathematical models to be used as a base for development of optimum control techniques which
can be applied in the design and operation of heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems
for large buildings.   The emphasis here is on the use of computers in the operation and control
of equipment and devices. <p>

<i><u>Professor B. Benhabib </u></i><p>
Development if information management systems for CAD geometric data.  Development of 
feature-based design systems.<p>

<i><u>Professor R.G. Fenton</u></i><p>
     Investigation is being undertaken to improve the efficiency of numerical optimization
methods.  A method of synthesis is developed for mechanisms design for generating a specified
output motion and minimizing a weighted error function.  Work is done on the development
of optimum design of cams. Optimum selection of cutting parameters, including cutting tool
material and tool change strategy determination, is undertaken.  Optimum design of robots is
being developed based on a number of kinematic and dynamic performance criteria.  Optimum
locations of tasks in the robotic workspace are determined.  Optimum allocation of subtask
durations for a given cycle time for robotic application are developed. Mathematical game theory
is used for solving multi-objective design problems. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     The work addresses topics in manufacturing (integration of automated work cells),
biomedical engineering (robotic aids for handicapped) and industrial applications (robotic-based
automation). <p>

<i><u>Professor A. Mandelis</u></i><p>
Advanced  laser photothermal wave instrumentation for engineering materials imaging, sub-
surface defect probing and measurement of thermophysical properties (see item under "Thermal
Sciences").  Novel infrared radiant heat transfer techniques are being developed to measure
thermal diffusivity conductivity with instrumentation and signal processing techniques
representing the optimum signal-to-noise ratio in photothermal science's state-of-the-art.  A
thorough understanding of signal processing in the Frequency and Time-Domains, combined
with modern digital narrowband filtering and with elementary and advanced aspects of
analytical conduction heat transfer theory are characteristics of this exciting interdisciplinary
research field.<p>

<i><u>Professor C.B. Park</u></i><p>
      This research will focus on the development of rapid prototyping and manufacturing systems. 
The recently developed Axiomatic Design approach will be effectively used in the process design
and system development.  Current research issues include the development of a
stereolithography system for polymer-based functional products, the development of a
Selective-Laser-Sintering system for metal/ceramic products, and the optimization of a U-V light
laser-beam delivery system. <p>    

<i><u>Professor L. Shu</u></i><p>
Several factors contribute to product performance indices such as life-cycle cost and environmental impact.  These performance indices can be optimized using combinatorial methods such as genetic algorithms.  A major advantage of genetic algorithms is the parallel search over multiple solutions instead of the optimization of a single solution characteristic of several other optimization approaches.  The results of appropriate optimizations will help identify trends in product design that minimize environmental impact.<p>

<i><u>Professor R.D. Venter</u></i><p>
     Design Theory and Methodologies.  Axiomatic considerations in the formalization of the
design approach.  Concurrent engineering.  Total quality management.  System design problems
extend to specific industrial applications.<p>
