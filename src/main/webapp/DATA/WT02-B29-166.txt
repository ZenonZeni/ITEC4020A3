<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Choosing the Right Investments</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Choose a mix of Funds that makes sense for your
goals</STRONG><BR>
One way to reduce risk is to diversify your investments across various
securities, asset
classes, market
sectors, or geographic regions.  Each MainStay Fund invests in many
securities. 
Some
invest across a
number of asset classes, market sectors, or parts of the globe.  Whether
you
choose just
one Fund or
several, MainStay makes it easy to get the level of diversification
that's right
for you.  The
following
examples are for educational purposes only.  Consulting with your
Registered
Representative can help
you determine which MainStay Funds are appropriate for your individual
situation. 
<P>
Investments in the
Money Market Fund are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S.
government, and
there is no
assurance that the Fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value
of
$1.00 per
share;
investment returns will vary with market conditions.  Investments in
foreign
securities may be subject to greater risks than domestic investments. 
These
risks include fluctuations of currencies, changes in U.S. or foreign tax
or
currency laws, and changes in monetary policies and economic and
political
conditions in foreign countries.

Joan is retired and her husband died last year, leaving her some stocks
and
insurance. 
Even with
Social Security and a small pension, her primary need is income.  She
invested
the
insurance
proceeds in a variety of fixed-income funds - for the strength of
government
bonds, the
higher return
potential of high yield securities, the diversification of international
bonds,
and the
stability and liquidity
of money market instruments.

Josh is 32 and just received a raise and a bonus.  With his career and
family
starting to
grow, he wants
to make the most of his investments over time. He selected the Capital
Appreciation Fund
for growth,
the Value Fund to broaden his asset mix, and the International Equity
Fund for
added
diversification and
return potential.  With over 30 years until he retires, Josh feels he can
ride
out any bumps
the equity
markets may bring over the short term.

<P>
John runs a plumbing supply business and his wife Irene is a nurse. 
Their
combined
income places
them in a high tax bracket.  While they're relatively conservative, they
know
they need
some growth to
stay ahead of inflation.  They put part of their money in the Tax Free
Bond Fund
and part
in the Equity
Index Fund.  They split the rest between
the Total
Return and
Government Funds, for a measured mix of income and growth potential.

Sylvia is a single businesswoman who likes diversification.  She chose
the
Equity Index
Fund for a wide
array of U.S. stocks and the International Equity Fund for exposure to
opportunities in
foreign markets. 
She likes the high income potential of international bonds and high yield
securities.  And
as a California
resident, she wants some investment income that's substantially free from
Federal and
California state
income taxes.

Carlos is a pilot who believes in taking risks as long as you have a
parachute. 
He uses a
broad mix of
investments to help protect himself from declines in any one market.  He
likes
the growth
potential of
the Convertible and Capital Appreciation Funds, and uses the Value Fund
to take
advantage of
opportunities the market may not yet have noticed.  To balance his equity
holdings he
uses the High
Yield Corporate Bond Fund and keeps a small amount in the Money Market
Fund
"just in
case."
