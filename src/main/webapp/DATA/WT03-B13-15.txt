EIAJ PROJECT VALUE OF 1990 PRODUCTION AT 23.90 TRILLION YEN+

     The Electronic Industries Association of Japan
(E IAJ) released its "1990 Production Forecasts for the
Japanese Electronics Industry" on December 20, 1989. This
report projects that the value of the industry's output in
1990 will rise 5.7% over the previous year to reach nearly
23.98 trillion yen. A breakdown by product category shows
that industrial electronic equipment production is expected
to expand 9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen, and will play
leading role in the overall growth of production. In terms
of value, this market will account for half of the
electronic industry's total output. Production of
electronic components and devices is expected to rise 3%,
to 7.83 trillion yen, though the rate of growth will be
lower than last year's. The forecast for consumer
electronic equipment shows production edging up only a
slight 0.9%, to just u nder 4.20 trillion yen.
    Total production of the electronics industry in 1989 is
estimated at 22.68 trillion yen, a gain of 6.7%
on the year. Meanwhile, the consumer electronic equipment
sector and general electronic components sector are not
expected to show such rosy results compared with the
forecasts made a year ago. But thanks to the growth seen
for industrial electronic equipment and semiconductors,
the overall output of the industry in 1989 is estimated to
expand pretty much as initially forecast.
    An outline of the 1989 production estimates and 1990
forecasts for the,electronics  industry is given below.

1989 Production Estimates+

      The Japanese economy sustained steady growth in
1989, supported by increased capital investment in the
private sector and strong consumer spending. The U.S. and
European economies also continued to expand, but at a
slower pace. With this economic environment as a backdrop,
the output of the Japanese electronics industry showed
robust growth.
     Looking at individual product segments, production of
industrial electronic equipment is estimated at 10.92
trillion yen, an increase of 10.2%, which reflects vigorous
capital spending. This segment is now approaching an 11
trillion yen  market in annual terms. The main driving
force behind the expansion in this sector is the
double-digit growth seen for computer equipment including
office and personal computers. Production of electronic
components and devices is estimated at 7.6 trillion yen,
a rise of 7.5% over 1988. This figure reflects sluggish
demand, from consumer electronic equipment manufactures,
despite the growth in sales of components for industrial
electronic equipment and for new multi-function,
compact product offerings. Production of consumer
electronic equipment is estimated at 4.16 trillion yen, a
drop of 2.4% from the previous year's level. This decline
is due to the downturn in domestic demand, which had shown
favorable expansion in previous years, and to increased
offshore production volumes by Japanese manufacturers. For
the first time ever, consumer electronic equipment is
expected to account for less than 20% of the electronic
industry's total output.

1990 Production Outlook+

     The annual output of the electronics industry is
projected to rise 5.7%, to nearly 23.98 yen.
     Projections made for individual product sectors
indicate that industrial electronic equipment will once
again be the leading factor behind the industry's expanding
output. Production in this sector is projected to climb
9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen. This increase reflects
vigorous capital investment plans for information systems,
including computers and communications equipment.
     Production of electronic components and
devices is expected to stand at 7.83 trillion yen, as
the annual growth rate drops off to 3.0%. This
slowdown is attributed to the bottoming out of
the growth rate for semiconductors and to
increased production of electronic equipment
overseas. These factors will more than offset the
continued expansion of demand for industrial
electronic equipment components, the growing
range of component applications and launches of
high value-added products.
    Consumer electronic equipment production is
expected to remain almost flat, edging up only by
developing new products that are tailored to 0.9%, to
4.20 trillion yen. This minuscule growth the needs of
consumers and serve to enrich their projection reflects the
continuation of expanding imports and sluggish exports due
to rising production volumes overseas, as well as the
absence of any factors that could substantially boost
domestic output. Bright spots in the outlook are expected
to include the growing popularity in the domestic
market of new products, such as camcorders and video disk
players and expanding demand both at home and abroad for
high value-added products.
     The supply-and-demand structure in the global
electronics industry is gradually being transformed
worldwide. Some of the factors at work here include the
rising offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers, the growth of competitors in the newly
industrializing economies (NIEs) of Asia and the steps
being taken to cope with integration of the EC market in
1992. Amidst these changes, the production system in the
domestic market is also undergoing a period of transition.
While future growth is expected in all product segments, it
is projected that growth differences among various market
sectors will become more obvious in 1990's production
figures.
    The following is an outline of the forecasts made for
individual product segments.

1990 Production outlook -2- +

(1) Consumer electronic equipment
     In the domestic market for consumer electronic
equipment, steady growth is expected for video equipment
owing to the spreading popularity of such new media as
satellite and high-definition broadcasting and video disk
players. Products like camcorders and CD players, which
incorporate state-of-the-art technologies, are also
projected to show strong advances. Offsetting these growth
factors will be a gradual decline in exports due to
the continued expansion of production overseas. As a
result, output of consumer electronic equipment is expected
to edge up only a slight 0.9%, to 4.2 trillion yen.
Although worldwide demand for high value-added products
will continue to advance, and there are numerous products
with excellent growth potential, these factors will not
be strong enough to boost production in the domestic
market.
     Domestic production of consumer electronic equipment
is now at a major turning point as a result of the
expanding offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers. An important challenge facing the Japanese
electronics industry in the years ahead will be to
stimulate demand by developing ne products that are
tailored to the needs of consumers and serve to enrich
their lifestyles.
(2) Industrial electronic equipment
     The 1990 forecast for industrial electronic
equipment calls for production to rise 9.4%, to 11.95
trillion yen.  The projections made individual categories
are outlined below.
     1)Radio communications systems
          Output of radio communications systems in
1990 is expected to increase 11.1%, to 987.7 billion yen.
Backed mainly by strong domestic demand, this increase will
exceed 1989's growth rate. Private-sector demand for radio
communications equipment is projected to show double-digit
growth, reflecting strong demand for car telephones, pocket
pagers and terminal equipment, as well as the increased
demand for base stations. Moreover, the launching of
private-sector communications satellites (JC-SAT and
Superbird) will usher in an era of full-fledged satellite
communications.   This is expected to stimulate increased
demand for satellite communications equipment in certain
businesses, including the education field, and also among
cable TV companies for the supply of programming. Strong
demand for radio communications systems is also expected
from the government sector, particularly from the Defense
Agency.
          Production of mobile communications equipment for
vehicles is projected to rise 19.3%, to 177.8
billion yen. This segment is expected to see the startup of
new cellular telephone companies in the Tohoku, Hokuriku
and Hokkaido regions, intensifying competition with NTT
over car telephone services and rates. This should lead to
a more active car telephone market and further penetration
of car telephone services. The MCA radio communications
sector is presently facing a line capacity shortage in the
Tokyo metropolitan area and a new system operating in the
quasimicrowave bandwidth is scheduled to be implemented in
 1990.
          Demand for marine communications equipment is
expected from the merchant shipping and shipbuilding
industries as a result of increased cargo movement due to
the economic upturn.  While demand from the Defense Agency
is projected to drop off gradually, other government
agencies are expected to place new and replacement orders
for experimental and training vessels. As a result, the
output of marine communications equipment is projected to
increase 4.8%, to 24.1 billion yen.
          Stable demand is forecast for aircraft
communications equipment, centering on the Mid Term
Defense Program of the Defense Agency.
          Production of radio application equipment is
expected to advance steadily to 285.8 billion yen, up 11%
over 1989, reflecting strong demand from the New Kansai
International Airport project, in addition to orders from
the Ministry of Transport and other government agencies.
     2)Electronic application equipment
          The forecast calls for electronic application
equipment production to increase 11.3%, to nearly 7.3
trillion yen. Within this sector, output of computers and
related equipment is expected to reach 6.36 trillion yen,
up 11.6%, about the same growth rate as In 1989. This
increase will be supported by continued active demand for
personal and office computers and other core products.
          Production of TV monitors for industrial use is
expected to show a 12% rise, climbing to 136.7 billion yen.
Supporting this growth will be a double-digit increase in
domestic demand for monitors used in supervision
applications (e.g. traffic control systems, production
lines, financial institutions and retail stores) and in
inspection and measurement applications (e.g. automation of
visual inspection systems and dimension and profile
measurement systems). Output of ultrasonic application
equipment is projected to climb to 181.9 billion yen, a
favorable advance of 10.8%, centering around medical
equipment demand.
     3) Electric measuring instrumentation
     The 1990 forecast for electric measuring
instrumentation production calls for a firm gain of 7.2%,
with output rising to 698.2 billion yen. Oscilloscopes are
expected to register double-digit growth supported by an
increase in more sophisticated models as a result of the
further penetration of digital oscilloscopes and the
development of new office automation and factory automation
equipment. However, due to the bottoming out of growth in
the semiconductor sector in 1990, demand is expected to be
sluggish for electronic tubes, semiconductors and IC
measuring devices, which, together, account for
approximately 30% of the electric measuring instrumentation
market. As a result, this market will slip to single-digit
growth in contrast to its double-digit expansion in 1989.
     4) Electronic business machines
     Production of electronic business machines is expected
to rise 6.2%, to 1.08 trillion yen, led mainly by continued
strong demand in the domestic market.
     Electronic calculators are projected to show continued
double-digit   growth, sustained by product offerings
featuring expanded functions, such as electronic memo
books, and by consumer preferences for more sophisticated
products.
     Word processor output is expected to show favorable
growth, buoyed by firm domestic demand. Copy machine
production is projected to grow favorably overall. Orders
in the domestic market are likely to rise as a result of
increased demand from small and medium-sized businesses
and replacement demand stemming from the shift to higher
grade models. This will be offset, however, by slower
export growth as Japanese manufacturers expand their
offshore production volumes. Production of cash registers
is forecast to show solid growth, supported primarily by
demand for point of sale terminals, as the special demand
for new equipment capable of handling sales tax
computations has run its course.
(3) Electronic components
     The 1990 forecast for electronic components calls for
production to rise 2.9% over the previous year, to 3.29
trillion yen. Demand is expected to remain strong for
components used in industrial electronic equipment, such
as office automation, information processing and
communications systems. A key point in this segment will be
whether the introduction of new products can rejuvenate
demand in the video and audio equipment markets.
      Passive component production is projected to show a
small 2.6% increase, rising to 1.24 trillion yen. Further
advances are expected for highdensity surface-mounted
equipment and composition technologies, in response to
changing equipment needs. Manufacturers will be working
to concentrate technologies, enhance reliability,
diversify product lines and create higher valueadded
products.
     Production of functional components is expected to
register a slight gain of 1.7%, rising to 416.4 billion
yen. The forecast for mechanical component production calls
for continued solid growth, with output rising 4.7%, to
1.07 trillion yen.
(4) Active devices
     The 1990 production forecast for active devices shows
a rise of 2.2%, with output advancing to 4.35 trillion yen.
Semiconductors, which account for nearly 80% of this
market, have tended so far to show a four-year growth
cycle. Based on past experience, 1990 is expected to be the
year when active device production bottoms out.
     In the macroeconomic picture for 1990, the U.S.
economy is expected to experience a soft landing, while
domestic demand remains strong in Japan. As a result, a
period of moderate adjustment is foreseen, with a downward
trend overall. The production trend for active components
is expected to follow this basic pattern, as a shallow
bottoming out is projected to occur in mid-1990, followed
by an upturn during the second half of the year.
     In the electronic tubes category, domestic production
is expected to shift from cathode-ray tubes for color
televisions (CRTS) to cathode-ray tubes for color displays
(CDTs). Output of the former tubes is expected to decline,
owing to expanding offshore production volumes of Japanese
manufacturers and growing competition with the Asian NIES,
while production of the latter tubes is projected to show
steady growth due to the increase in high value-added
products. Production of display tubes, which has continued
to show relatively high growth, is expected to sustain
double-digit expansion, supported by solid demand for
industrial electronic equipment and the widening range of
applications for these tubes. As a result, output of
electronic tubes in 1990 is expected to remain firm,
registering a slight increase of 0.9%, to 684.5 billion
yen.
     Discrete semiconductor devices are projected to show a
production gain of 1.8%, rising to 665.3 billion yen. This
forecast reflects a slowdown in demand for consumer
electronic equipment, which should be partially offset by
favorable demand in the industrial electronic equipment
market.
     Production of semiconductor ICs is forecast. at
2.75 trillion yen, up 2.4%, but sharply off from the 18.7%
growth rate in 1989. While output is not likely to decline,
1990 is seen as being a period of moderate adjustment.
     MOS digital ICs are projected to show sluggish
production expansion, rising only 2.9% in 1990, far below
the 1989 growth level of 28.2%. Demand should be stimulated
by the introduction of more sophisticated microcomputer
ICs, such as 32-bit, high-speed, multi-gate devices, and
higher valuueadded memory products, including faster, more
highly integrated devices. However, the market as a whole
is expected to grow slowly because of uncertainties
regarding the supply-and-demand balance and future market
conditions.
     Output of hybrid ICs is projected to grow steadily in
1990 to 252.5 billion yen, an increase of 5.4% over 1989.
Because of the nature of custom-made products, demand is
not expected to be influenced significantly by overall
market conditions.
     Production of liquid crystal devices is pro jected to
show strong growth of 27.7%, climbing to 185.6 billion yen.
This favorable expansion will be supported by the rapid
shift from watch and calculator applications to large LCDs
for personal computers, word processors and other products.
Another supporting factor will be the growing demand for
color LCD devices.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INTRODUCTION OF THREE NEW DIGITAL RADIO SYSTEMS+

    -- Technical Requirements for Introduction of
three New Digital Radio Systems --

On January 22, the Telecommunications Technol-
ogy Council (TTC) submitted its final report to
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
concerning "Technical Requirements for Fixed
Digital Microwave Radio Networks". The report
recommends the introduction of three new sys-
tems: a medium-capacity systqm that provides
increased circuit capacity for public service net-
works, a system for telecommunications enter-
prises that uses the existing submicrowave band,
and a new small-capacity system to replace the
current public service system.
       Microwave radio is used for private communi-
cation, by national and municipal self-governing
bodies and public   institutions for disaster preven-
tion and maintenance of public order, and by commercial
entities for provision of electric power, gas and railway
communications. At present, public service have practical
use of up to the telephone circuit equivalent of 576
channels. However, in order to respond to the recent rapid
increase in amounts of information transmitted and the
need for image transmission due to integration of social
activities and the developing information society, the
introduction of a new radio system that provides about 1.5
times larger capacity than the existing system is desired.
      In addition, due to the rapid increase in demand for
mobile communication, as well as for car telephone service,
there is a significant shortage of available frequencies
for mobile communication service, so use of part of the
submicrowave band (2 GHz band) is being considered for
mobile communication service. Therefore, it has become
necessary to sequentially shift the small-capacity,
fixed circuits used for telecommunication service and
public service in the submicrowave band to higher
frequencies. For these reasons, the Teleommunications
Technology Council concluded in its final report that the
technical requirements for introduction of three new
systems should be as listed in Table 1.
      For telecommunication service use, however, a
large-capacity digital radio system that utilizes the
world's first 256 quadrature amplitude modulation system,
an epoch making technology developed by NTT, has been in
operation since December of last year.

NTT Pocket Pagers Pass the 3 Million Unit Mark+

     NTT recently announced that, as of the end of December
1989, the number of subscriptions for its pocket pager
services broke the 3 million level. (Total subscriptions
for the 30 new pocket pager companies: 1.05 million.)
      NTT's pocket pager service started in the 23  wards
of Tokyo in July 1968, was extended to Osaka in 1969, and
to Nagoya and Yokohama in 1970. At present, it is available
in most cities throughout Japan.
     The number of pocket pager subscriptions  exceeded 0.5
million in FY '75, reached 1 million in FY '80, passed 2
million in FY '85, then broke the 3 million level at the
end of December last year.
      Introduction of new services included the  start of
dual-call service in 1982, numeric-display pocket pagers in
April 1987, and fixed-statement display, pen-type and
card-type pagers in December 1988. There have also been
reductions in usage charges and deposits. In addition.
NTT had been developing various new services, such as
multi-area service, since November of last year.
     A breakdown of the 3 million subscriptions shows that
about two thirds of them are for "call only" (tone-only)
service, but there has recently been a significant increase
in the number of subscriptions for numeric-display and
pen-type pagers.
      NTT is planning to reduce its monthly charges for
pocket pager service on March 1 of this year. Charges for
tone-only service will be reduced from 2,500 yen to 2,000
yen, for numeric-display service from 2,900 yen to 2,600
yen, and fixedstatement-display service from 3,300 yen to
2,900 yen. In addition, those subscribers with contracts
for 31 or more units, will no longer have to pay a  deposit
for the 31st and succeeding sets. The monthly charge for
dual-call service will be reduced to 100 yen from the
current 250 yen, and from 1,700 yen to 1,400 yen for
portable receivers.

High-Performance Optical Fiber Amplifier+

      On January 25, NTT announced that it has succeeded in
the trial production of a miniature highperformance optical
fiber amplifier with an amplification factor exceeding
2,000.
     NTT has been conducting research on optical fiber
amplifiers to enable direct amplification of optical
signals through the use of optical fiber injected with
erbium (erbium-doped fiber). Thus, NTT's prototype system
uses erbium-doped fiber manufactured using vapor-phase
axial deposition (VAD) technology developed by NTT for
production of low-loss optical fiber and a newly devel-
oped semiconductor laser to supply energy to the optical
fiber amplifier. The volume of the prototype device is 36
cc, which is about one third the size of a pack of
cigarettes.
     When this amplifier is put to practical use, it can
easily be set up in a narrow space, such as inside optical
transmission equipment or optical relay devices. It is also
expected to contribute significantly to the extending of
relay distance and to the increasing of transmission speed
to the ultrahigh-speed range. With its broad general
purpose capabilities, this amplifier should have a wide
application range, including CATV and various optical
measuring installations.
     NTT has already succeeded in doubling the repeater
spacing (to 212 kilometers) of its current optical
transmission system using an optical fiber amplifier at 1.8
Gb/s, which proves the effectiveness of optical fiber
amplifiers.             (No. 103-2-4)

Recent Trends at KDD
    -- KDD to jointly Offer Port-PLAN with BT and MCI-- +

      On February 6, KDD announced that it has concluded
agreements with BT of England and MCI of the U.S. for the
joint offering of Port-PLAN (company communication network
service) and will start providing that service from the
middle of this year.
     According to the agreements, both BT and MCI will set
up digital voice switching devices (ICXs), which KDD was
the first in the world to develop, as their core facilities
for this service. The ICX is a switching system that
provides for various  type of communication, such as
facsimile and voice communication, as well as message
communication. The system enables construction of an
economical international incompany communication network
that can easily and quickly respond to user demand using
facilities installed in KDD, BT and MCI, without the
Port-PLAN user being required to posses related facilities
normally required for an international communication
network.
     Port-PLAN is a ready-made network service that
utilizes a previously established KDD leased circuit
service in response to user's demand, and was started on
August 1, 1989.
     Until now, in order to utilize Port-PLAN, the user had
to provide his own facilities on the overseas side.
Now, however, the offering of PortPLAN by BT and MCI makes
it possible for the application of a global network that
integrates various communication media in three countries
(Japan, England and the U.S.A.). In addition, maintenance
of the network is provided on a 24 hour basis for the
highest reliability.
     The leased system that is the core for the network
provides individual ports and trunks by media, including
voice, facsimile, data and teletype, with each leased
system connected by high-speed digital leased circuits
(Hi-BITLINK), which has extremely high reliability. Users
can easily and quickly construct a leased network just by
connection through a domestic circuit to the center facil-
ity in each country. In addition, the system can flexibly
respond to an increase or decrease in the amount Of
communication handled , or expand/update the network
configuration just by changing ports or trunks, thus
allowing users to apply the communication system that most
economically merits their demand. The leased system for the
overseas side are set up in London and Piscataway, New
Jersey.

--PC ISDN Board Compatible with OSI Communication
              and VAX ISDN Board Put to Practical Use--+

     On January 31, KDD announced that it had succeeded in
developing and putting to practical use the world's first
ISDN board compatible with personal computer OSI
communication, which enables communication between
different types of computers by connecting with ISDN. KDD
has also succeeded in putting to practical use Japan's
first ISDN board for the VAX minicomputers produced by DEC.
The board enables communcation between VAX units or
terminals in remote areas through ISDN.
    OSI Plus Corp., a KDD subsidiary, has been charged with
commercialization of both ISDN boards, with sales starting
on February 1.
     A description of the two boards follows.
(1) OSI-compatible PC ISDN board
     When combined with an OSI layer 5 board, which is
already commercially available, this board enables the use
of an all-purpose personal computer for OSI communication,
including high-speed file transfer and message
communication, through KDD's international ISDN service
or NTT's INS-Net 64. It also provides for multi-media
communication by simultaneous communication of voice and
data or voice and images, through the use of two B channels
(Refer to Figures 1, 2).
     OSI Plus Corp., the original distributor, has combined
this board with an OSI layer 5 board and will sell the
combined unit as "u-OSI/ISDN". It consists of two boards,
each with its own CPU, and must be installed in two
expansion slots in the personal computer for use. At
present boards are only available for, NEC 9801 Series
computers, but boards for other personal computers and work
stations are under development. The unit is priced at
590,000 yen, with shipping scheduled to start on May 1.
(2) VAX ISDN board
     This board was developed by KDD in cooperation with
ABIT Corp. It provides for direct connection to DEC's VAX
mini-computer, which is in use throughout the world, and is
simply installed in an expansion slot in the VAX. enables
high-speed file transfer and host access with VAX or other
terminals through an ISDN from the terminal or a telephone
coupler connected to the VAX or directly to the board.
(Refer to Figure 3).
     OSI Plus sells this board as a "VIT1000 ISDN Interface
Board", and it is priced at 800,000 yen for the basic
system, which includes the main board, an expansion
interface box and accessories. Various options are also
available, including a 64/56 Kb/s V.11 interface unit
(25,000 yen) and a 4-board asynchronous interface expansion
unlit (100,000 yen). Shipping is expected to start on April
2.
     The DEC minicomputers with which the VIT1000 can be
used include the Micro VAX Series and the VAX Station
Series. The product can be used to construct a broadband
LAN through an ISDN by connecting VAX networks or LANs that
use the VAX.              (No. 103-2-6)

--KDD joint U.S. INFONET by Investment by Investment--+

      On January 11, KDD announced that it has obtained a 5%
share of INFONET Service Corp., a U.S. data communication
company whose other stock holders are major
telecommunication carriers in Europe and the Asia/Pacific
region, from Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a U.S.
information communication software company. KDD will also
dispatch one executive to join the company. This
joining-by-investment will allow KDD to respond more
flexibly to demands for international data communication
service in cooperation with the other telecommunication
carriers that are already stockholders in the company.
     Currently, Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co. (MKI), a
subsidiary of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., is offering INFONET
service in Japan. However, KDD is studying possible methods
of offering INFONET service in the future in cooperation
with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and MKI.
     INFONET Service Corp. was established in 1970 as a
division of CSC. At present, it provides data communication
and information processing services both inside the U.S.
and internationally. In 1988, INFONET separated from CSC
and became an independent company, and telecommunication
carriers in Europe and the Asia/Oceania region have been
joining the company by investment in succession. With
KDD's investment at this time, major telecommunications
carriers in the U.S., Europe and the Asia and Pacific
region will jointly own and operate INFONET.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Develops High-Capacity,
Compact Central Earth Station for Video and Data Signals+

      On January 16, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
announced that it had developed a compact, high-
performance radio system for use in satellite com-
munication central earth stations. The new radio
system gives the central earth stations the capabil-
ity to transmit both video and data signals, as well
as increasing maintainability.
    The system is capable of transmitting multiple
carrier data signals and a broadband video signal at
the same time, so it is expected to have positive
effect on the promotion and diffusion of satellite-
based multimedia communication networks, which
are considered to have serious potential in the
future. Until now, it has been necessary to transmit
and receive the two types of signals using separate
systems.
    The satellite communication central earth
station provides the core functions for the data
communication network and controls the network,
which is composed of multiple VSATS. Therefore,
the equipment used must provide high perform-
ance and be highly reliable. Recently, there has
also been increasing demand for reduction of
required installation space. That is, what is
required now is a more compact system with
increased maintainability.
    The same is true for satellite-based multi-
media communication networks. That is, construc-
tion of such a system requires development of
a small earth station capable of transmitting both
multiple carrier data signals and a broadband video
signals.
    Matsushita's new system has been developed
in response to these requirements. Its primary
features include (1) a compact system with excel-
lent maintainability that can be set up and
operated in simple mini-shelters. (2) capability
to simultaneously transmit both data and video
signals for construction of a multimedia communi-
cation network, and (3) a future-oriented design
that provides flexible system configuration and
high performance capable of sending high-defini-
tion TV signals. The system is expected to find
significant application of these features in (1)
central earth stations for VSAT data communica-
tion   networks,    (2) central earth stations for
satellite news gathering (SNG), and (3) satellite
communication entral earth stations for various
private networks.
