<P>
The CRC for Freshwater Ecology was established in July 1993 to develop the ecological basis for the sustainable management of surface waters in Australian temperate regions. It brings together major limnological research groups in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
There are six major research programs: flowing waters, standing waters and eutrophication, floodplain and wetland ecology, water quality and ecological assessment, urban water management, and fish ecology and management. The research staff comprise ecologists in the areas of microbiology, algae, zooplankton, aquatic plants, invertebrates, fish, and floodplains. The centre has strong chemistry, physics and computing resources.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
The CRC for Freshwater Ecology has established a comprehensive research program in many areas of limnology. Education is provided for postgraduates, undergraduates, and school and community groups. Technology and knowledge is transferred through workshops, seminars and scientific literature to other researchers and water resource managers.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Although the focus of the CRC is on improving the quality of freshwater ecosystems, some of the outcomes such as water quality instrumentation and computer programs could have a commercial basis.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
There is considerable expertise in Victoria with well-established research groups located at Monash University, Melbourne Water and La Trobe University.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The CRC is involved in training almost 60 postgraduate students, nine of whom are either partly or fully supported by CRC funding. Summer scholarships are provided to undergraduates to work on relevant projects. Workshops are held for limnologists from around Australia to exchange knowledge and discuss issues affecting the training of young scientists, principally within the universities.
Curriculum materials have been produced for primary and secondary schools, and field trips, excursions, workshops and talks have been organised for students. Community education courses in freshwater ecology are also being developed.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The CRC for Freshwater Ecology can offer consulting in ecological areas, as well as provide analytical chemical services in its labor atories. The CRC is available to offer expertise in resource management and sustainable ecological practices to community and scientific groups.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The Australian Government is providing $12.955 million over the seven-year period from July 1993 to June 2000, and the participating organisations are contributing $50.395 million in cash and in-kind.
