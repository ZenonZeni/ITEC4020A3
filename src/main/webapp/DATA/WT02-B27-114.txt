<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI)</H3>
Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) was developed at the <A HREF="http://www.wcer.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin Center for Educational Research</A> by Tom Carpenter and Elizabeth Fennema.  CGI focuses on helping teachers make decisions about instruction based on knowledge from cognitive science.  Carpenter and Fennema believe that teaching is a form of problem solving as opposed to a set of procedures that can be determined in advance.  Although specific practices are not dictated, there are general principles of instruction underlying this approach.  These principles are:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Instruction should be appropriate for each student.  More specifically,
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> problems, concepts, or procedures being learned should be appropriate for each student;<BR>
<LI> students should be able to relate new tasks to prior knowledge;<BR>
<LI> instructional decisions should be based on regular assessment of each student's knowledge throughout instruction.<BR>
</OL><BR>
<LI> Instruction should actively involve students in constructing knowledge with understanding.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Instruction should stress relationships among concepts, skills and problem solving.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Assessment should determine not only if a learner is able to solve problems, but should also concentrate on the cognitive processes used to solve problems.
</OL>
