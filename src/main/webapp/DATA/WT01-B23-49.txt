<h2>SUMMARY OF PRELIMINARY REPORT</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1. This is not a study of marijuana users or their
        behavior, but a study of the activity of police, courts,
        and prisons. </li>
    <li>2. In 1974 we did a study for the California Senate which
        showed that it was costing about $100 million a year
        (1972) to enforce the marijuana laws. This compares with
        1960, when only about $8 million was spent for this. </li>
    <li>3. THREE MAIN REASONS for escalation of costs in 1960s: <ul>
            <li>1) A MAJOR CHANGE IN DRUG OFFENDER
                CHARACTERISTICS. In 1960 the typical person
                arrested for drugs in California was a
                26-year-old Hispanic heroin addict from Los
                Angeles, with a long criminal record. By 1967 the
                typical drug offender was a 19-year-old white
                marijuana smoker with no criminal record, often a
                middle-class youth -from the suburbs. </li>
            <li>2) ARREST VOLUME. In 1962 there were 3,743
                marijuana arrests in the state. In 1967 there
                were ten times as many (37,514). By 1972 there
                were 76,561, of which 73,000 were felony arrests.
                By 1974 there were nearly 100,000 felony
                marijuana arrests statewide. </li>
            <li>3) FELONY STATUS of POSSESSION OFFENSES. The most
                frequent marijuana offense was possession of a
                small amount, and it was a felony. By 1974,
                one-fourth of all the felony arrests in
                California were for marijuana. </li>
            <li>This meant that: POLICE RESOURCES, formerly
                concentrated on Los Angeles heroin addicts, now
                had to be spread statewide to a much more diverse
                and less visible populations and many departments
                had to add narcotics officers to their staff. The
                sheer volume of arrests greatly increased law
                enforcement costs statewide. </li>
            <li>Also: COURT COSTS, especially in Superior Court
                where felonies are adjudicated, rose dramatically
                as thousands of felony marijuana possession cases
                created a logjam in the courts. Prosecutors and
                judges found it difficult to send 19-yearold
                first offenders to prison for possession, and
                conviction rates fell. </li>
            <li>In sum, thousands of young people were arrested
                on -felony charges each year. All had to be
                processed through the criminal justice system,
                and criminal justice agency costs skyrocketed. </li>
            <li>One-fourth of the felony arrests in California
                were for marijuana and it was costing the state
                $100 million a year to process marijuana
                offenders. </li>
            <li>This was the situation the Moscone Law of 1975
                was designed to alleviate. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>4. There were several legislative attempts to deal with
        this problem by allowing felony marijuana possession
        cases to be processed in the lower courts. These were
        TEMPORARILY successful in reducing congestion in Superior
        Courts, but could not solve the essential problem, that
        thousands of young people were being fed into the
        criminal justice system because possession was still
        classified as a felony. </li>
    <li>5. Two important influences on legislative policy during
        this period were the 1972 RECOMMENDATION OF THE NATIONAL
        COMMISSION on Marihuana and Drug Abuse that marijuana
        possession be decriminalized, and the 1972 CALIFORNIA
        MARIJUANA INITIATIVE, which would have decriminalized
        possession avid cultivation for personal use. CMI was
        defeated statewide, but garnered 34% of the vote,
        providing new impetus to repeal felony penalties for
        possession. </li>
    <li>6. THE MOSCONE ACT. After two years of hearings and a
        thorough investigation by a Senate Select Committee
        chaired by Senate Majority Leader George Moscone, a
        compromise was reached among legislators who would not
        accept complete legalization of marijuana. The essence of
        the Moscone Act (passed in 1975, took effect Pages
        January 1, 1976) was to reduce possession of small
        amounts 25-27 of marijuana FROM A FELONY TO A NEW TYPE OF
        MISDEMEANOR, in which a citation is issued to the
        offender rather than arrest and booking; and for which
        the MAXIMUM PENALTY is a $100 fine instead of jail or
        prison. </li>
    <li>7. The EFFECT OF THE MOSCONE ACT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT COSTS
        in California is what we are examining in our new study.
        We have not completed the DISPOSITIONS part of our study
        yet, but this is a preliminary report on its effect in
        regard to the COSTS OF MAKING ARRESTS. </li>
    <li>S. GRAPH MJFM6084 - CALIFORNIA MARIJUANA ARRESTS 1960-84.
        This graph shows the effect of the Moscone Act on
        marijuana 29-31 arrests. FELONY arrests fell dramatically
        from about 100,000 in 1974 to about 20,000 in 1976-- a
        drop of about 8O,000. </li>
    <li>MISDEMEANOR marijuana arrests leaped from about 3500 in
        1972 to about 35,000 in 1978. (Unfortunately misdemeanor
        marijuana arrests were not recorded between 1972 and 1977
        so we can't be more precise about the number of
        misdemeanor or total marijuana arrests for those years.) </li>
    <li>So the CUMULATIVE effect of the Moscone Act was to reduce
        total marijuana arrests from more than 100,000 a year to
        below 64,000 in the 1980s-- a reduction of at least
        36,OOO arrests a year. </li>
</ul>

<h3>EFFECTS OF THE MOSCONE ACT ON MARIJUANA ARREST COSTS</h3>

<ul>
    <li>9. The method we have used to calculate marijuana arrest
        costs was invented in 1972 by A. ALAN POST, then the
        Legislative Analyst for the State of California. After
        consultation with law enforcement agencies Post
        determined that about one-fourth of a police officer's
        time is devoted to investigating and making arrests.
        Therefore one-fourth of law enforcement budgets were
        expended on making arrests. </li>
    <li>Thus, the percentage of total arrests which were for
        marijuana could be applied to one-fourth of state law
        enforcement expenditures., for a reasonable approximation
        of the cost of making marijuana arrests. </li>
    <li>The law enforcement costs included in this calculation
        are the expenditures of county and state police,
        sheriffs' departments and the California Highway Patrol. </li>
    <li>These law enforcement ARREST costs should not be confused
        with the total amount of money spent in processing
        offenders through the criminal justice system. It does
        not include the costs of prosecution public defenders,
        the courts, or penal institutions. In 19729 for instance
        the arrest costs were only $13.2 million of the total
        $100 million expended. </li>
    <li>10. GRAPH ARRCOSTS- ACTUAL MARIJUANA ARREST EXPENDITURES
        73-84. In 1972, there were 76,561 marijuana arrests. The
        cost of making these arrests was $13.2 MILLION, or about
        $173 per arrest. By 1974, with nearly 100,000 felony
        marijuana arrests, the cost had risen to $18.4 MILLION,
        or $185 per arrest. </li>
    <li>11. Then we discovered that the Moscone Act, which was
        passed in July 1975 but did not take effect until
        January, 1976, had a surprising effect even before it
        officially took effect. Its passage sent a message to
        police around the state that possession was no longer
        going to be considered a felony, and marijuana arrests
        dropped sharply -for the last six months of 1975. </li>
    <li>This caused a slight $129000 drop in 1975 marijuana
        arrest costs, but because law enforcement expenditures in
        general were rising while the number of marijuana arrests
        was falling, the cost per marijuana arrest rose to $214. </li>
    <li>12. Then in 1976, directly as a result of the new law,
        marijuana arrest expenditures fell to $4.5 MILLION, or
        $235 per arrest. That same year, 1976, statewide felony
        arrests dropped by about 75,000. Most of this decrease
        was marijuana arrests. </li>
    <li>13. The nosedive in arrest costs continued in 1977, down
        to $4.3 MILLION. The costs of misdemeanor marijuana
        arrests are not included because the arrest statistics
        are not available. Still, a savings of $14 million a year
        ($28 million in two years) in felony arrest costs is a
        considerable achievement for a single legal change. </li>
    <li>14. In 1978, when misdemeanor marijuana arrests again
        began to be counted, arrest costs rose to $14.9 MILLION,
        or $282 per arrest. This was still lower than the $18
        million a year being spent before the Moscone Act. It
        took another two years until 1980, for arrest costs to
        pass their pre-Moscone level. </li>
    <li>15. IN THE 1980s, California marijuana arrests have
        levelled off at about 64,000 a year, of which about
        20-22,000 are felonies (mostly sale) and about 42-44,000
        are misdemeanors. Even though arrests have levelled off,
        law enforcement costs in general have continued to rise
        because of inflation and many other reasons, including
        the continued expansion of police forces and all other
        criminal justice agencies. </li>
    <li>16. Thus by 1984, marijuana arrest costs have risen to
        about $30.5 MILLION a year, or nearly $500 ($480.24) per
        arrest. This is a 131 PERCENT RISE in actual expenditures
        since 1972 when marijuana arrest costs were $13.2
        million. </li>
    <li>17. INFLATION-ADJUSTED MARIJUANA ARREST EXPENDITURES. </li>
    <li>In order to understand the real savings attributable to
        the Moscone Act, it is necessary to account for
        inflation. We have done this by using the &quot;State and
        Local Government Implicit Price Deflator&quot; which is
        routinely used by government agencies in budget analysis.
    </li>
    <li>18. GRAPH INFARRCO (inflation-adjusted arrest costs). </li>
    <li>As the graph shows in 1974 dollars, marijuana arrest
        costs have still not risen above their pre-Moscone level.
        1984 inflation-adjusted expenditures on marijuana arrests
        were about $14 million, 24 percent below the $18 million
        spent in 1974 and just slightly more than was spent in
        1975. </li>
    <li>In fact, the 1984 inflation-adjusted expenditures are
        only slightly more than the $13.2 million actually
        expended in 1972. </li>
    <li>19. Graph PRISPOP - MARIJUANA FELONS IN PRISON. </li>
    <li>Although we have not completed the Dispositions part of
        our study the California Department of Corrections has
        made available to us the total number of marijuana felons
        in prison each year between 1972 and 1984. </li>
    <li>This graph shows one of the most dramatic effects of the
        the Moscone Act-- a massive drop in the number of people
        in state prison for felony marijuana offenses. </li>
    <li>In 1973 there were 668 such prisoners, the highest number
        in California history. </li>
    <li>In 1980, largely because the Moscone Act and other
        measures had reduced the number of felony marijuana
        offenders being fed into prison through Superior Court,
        the number of marijuana prisoners dropped to only 98--
        the lowest number in recent state history. </li>
    <li>Recently (1984), with about 21,000 felony marijuana
        arrests being made for sale, possession for sale and
        cultivation each year, the number of marijuana felons in
        prison has risen to 327 -- exactly ten more than there
        were in 1975. </li>
    <li>Thus the Moscone Act did the same for marijuana prisoner
        populations that it did for arrest costs-- it contained
        them at just above their 1975 level (when the law was
        passed). </li>
</ul>

<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<ul>
    <li>20. The net effect of the Moscone Act was to reduce
        inflation-adjusted marijuana arrest expenditures by 24
        percent from 1974 to 1984, and to contain marijuana
        arrest costs at about their 1975 level (when the bill was
        passed). There is no other crime in the state for which
        this can be said. </li>
    <li>21. The most important single effect of the Moscone Act
        was to reduce the number of felony marijuana arrests by
        about 80,000 a year. This reduction was permanent and
        represents a considerable savings to the taxpayer. </li>
    <li>Cumulatively, it means that about 720,000 felony
        marijuana arrests and dispositions did not have to be
        paid for during the nine-year period 1976 - 1984, nor an
        additional 80,000 per year since then. </li>
    <li>In 1984 dollars, with every marijuana arrest costing
        about $500, that means the Moscone Act saved the
        taxpayers around $360 MILLION between 1976 and 1984 in
        felony arrest costs. </li>
    <li>(This does not include any prosecutor public defender,
        court disposition.., or penal institution costs.) </li>
    <li>22. It is rare that a single legal change has such an
        immediate and drastic effect on arrests and enforcement
        costs in a state. </li>
</ul>
