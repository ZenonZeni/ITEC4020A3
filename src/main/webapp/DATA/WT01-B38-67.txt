<h1>RICHARDSON-TAYLOR REUNION NEWS</h1>

<p><b>SPECIAL UPDATE</b> </p>

<p><b>May 12, 1990</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Ruthie wrote me with a few updates to the prior information. </p>

<p>She says they were unable to get the park for Saturday
(something about too much police surveillance) so Saturday will
be at Spring Lake. </p>

<p>She is going to try to get &quot;the spot on your left just as
you come off the hill into the park area.&quot; Ruthie said that
if anyone has trouble finding the group she would leave a trail
of bread crumbs but, of course, that only works until the first
Morris shows up. If in doubt, look for the clouds of tear gas and
flashing police lights - the family will be in the middle. </p>

<p>Hot dogs and hamburgers will be served around noon, with the
big meal around 4:00 PM. Remember that, if you are approached by
any family member you do not immediately recognize, throw some
food away from your car. Do not attempt to feed them by hand. </p>

<p>Sunday will be at Howarth Park as previously stated. </p>

<p>She says to be sure to remember to bring all of the following
items: </p>

<p>bathing suits (to avoid the perennial lewd conduct charges) </p>

<p>lots of ice (to take the swelling down) </p>

<p>extra ice chests (storage space is always a problem) </p>

<p>snacks (in sealed packets so the Leards can't smell them) </p>

<p>charcoal (fire helps to keep the Morrises at bay) </p>

<p>drinks </p>

<p>Doug and Barbara should bring their game. Ruthie said that
everyone really enjoyed it as long as they were sober. </p>

<p>Ruthie says there are paddle boats, hiking trails (remember to
bring shoes), and a nice area for volleyball. </p>

<p>Ruthie also asked me to remind everyone that it is time to
send your contributions. The contribution is $8.00 per household
(cheaper than the average parking ticket) and should be sent to: </p>

<p>Ruth Newcomb </p>

<p>I still have not heard from all of the nefarious family
members with their most current family information. I would like
to publish a fairly complete update of the family information to
distribute at or near the reunion, so it would be nice if you
would all send it in. If you do not, I will do the most dastardly
thing possible - I will tell the truth about you. I am sure no
one wants that. </p>
