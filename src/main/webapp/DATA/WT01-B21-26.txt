<h3><a name="Exec_summ">Executive summary <br>
</a></h3>

<p>The following is a summary of the major adverse health and
psychological effects of acute and chronic cannabis use, grouped
according to the degree of confidence in the view that the
relationship between cannabis use and the adverse effect is a
causal one. <br>
</p>

<h4><a name="acute">Acute effects</a> </h4>

<p>anxiety, dysphoria, panic and paranoia, especially in naive
users; <br>
cognitive impairment, especially of attention and memory, for the
duration of intoxication; <br>
psychomotor impairment, and probably an increased risk of
accident if an intoxicated person attempts to drive a motor
vehicle, or operate machinery; <br>
an increased risk of experiencing psychotic symptoms among those
who are vulnerable because of personal or family history of
psychosis; <br>
an increased risk of low birth weight babies if cannabis is used
during pregnancy. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="chronic">Chronic effects</a> </h4>

<p>The major health and psychological effects of chronic heavy
cannabis use, especially daily use over many years, remain
uncertain. On the available evidence, the major probable adverse
effects appear to be: </p>

<p>respiratory diseases associated with smoking as the method of
administration, such as chronic bronchitis, and the occurrence of
histopathological changes that may be precursors to the
development of malignancy. <br>
development of a cannabis dependence syndrome, characterised by
an inability to abstain from or to control cannabis use; <br>
subtle forms of cognitive impairment, most particularly of
attention and memory, which persist while the user remains
chronically intoxicated, and may or may not be reversible after
prolonged abstinence from cannabis. </p>

<p>The following are the major possible adverse effects of
chronic, heavy cannabis use which remain to be confirmed by
further research: </p>

<p>an increased risk of developing cancers of the aerodigestive
tract, i.e. oral cavity, pharynx, and oesophagus; <br>
an increased risk of leukemia among offspring exposed while in
utero; <br>
a decline in occupational performance marked by underachievement
in adults in occupations requiring high level cognitive skills,
and impaired educational attainment in adolescents; <br>
birth defects occurring among children of women who used cannabis
during their pregnancies. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="high">High risk groups</a> <br>
<br>
<br>
</h4>

<h4><a name="adolescents">Adolescents</a> <br>
</h4>

<p>Adolescents with a history of poor school performance may have
their educational achievement further limited by the cognitive
impairments produced by chronic intoxication with cannabis. <br>
Adolescents who initiate cannabis use in the early teens are at
higher risk of progressing to heavy cannabis use and other
illicit drug use, and to the development of dependence on
cannabis. <br>
<br>
Women of childbearing age <br>
Pregnant women who continue to smoke cannabis are probably at
increased risk of giving birth to low birth weight babies, and
perhaps of shortening their period of gestation. <br>
Women of childbearing age who smoke cannabis at the time of
conception or while pregnant possibly increase the risk of their
children being born with birth defects. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="persons">Persons with pre-existing diseases</a> <br>
</h4>

<p>Persons with a number of pre-existing diseases who smoke
cannabis are probably at an increased risk of precipitating or
exacerbating symptoms of their diseases. These include: <br>
individuals with cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery
disease, cerebrovascular disease and hypertension; <br>
individuals with respiratory diseases, such as asthma,
bronchitis, and emphysema; <br>
individuals with schizophrenia, who are at increased risk of
precipitating or of exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms; <br>
individuals who are dependent on alcohol and other drugs, who are
probably at an increased risk of developing dependence on
cannabis. </p>

<p>The health risks of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use </p>

<h4><a name="acute_effects">Acute effects</a></h4>

<p>Alcohol. The major risks of acute cannabis use are similar to
the acute risks of alcohol intoxication in a number of respects.
First, both drugs produce psychomotor and cognitive impairment.
The impairment produced by alcohol increases risks of various
kinds of accident. It remains to be determined whether cannabis
intoxication produces similar increases in accidental injury and
death, although on balance it probably does. Second, substantial
doses of alcohol taken during the first trimester of pregnancy
can produce a foetal alcohol syndrome. There is suggestive but
far from conclusive evidence that cannabis used during pregnancy
may have similar adverse effects. Third, there is a major health
risk of acute alcohol use that is not shared with cannabis. In
large doses alcohol can cause death by asphyxiation, alcohol
poisoning, cardiomyopathy and cardiac infarct whereas there are
no recorded cases of fatalities attributable to cannabis. </p>

<p>Tobacco. The major acute health risks that cannabis share with
tobacco are the irritant effects of smoke upon the respiratory
system, and the stimulating effects of both THC and nicotine on
the cardiovascular system, both of which can be detrimental to
persons with cardiovascular disease. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="chronic_effects">Chronic effects</a> <br>
</h4>

<p>Alcohol. Chronic cannabis use may share some of the risks of
heavy chronic alcohol use. First, heavy use of either drug
increases the risk of developing a dependence syndrome in which
users experience difficulty in stopping or controlling their use.
There is strong evidence for such a syndrome in the case of
alcohol and reasonable evidence in the case of cannabis. Second,
there is reasonable clinical evidence that the chronic heavy use
of alcohol can produce psychotic symptoms and psychoses in some
individuals. There is suggestive evidence that chronic heavy
cannabis use may produce a toxic psychosis, precipitate psychotic
illnesses in predisposed individuals, and exacerbate psychotic
symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. Third, there is good
evidence that chronic heavy alcohol use can indirectly cause
brain injury - the Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome - with symptoms of
severe memory defect and an impaired ability to plan and
organise. Chronic cannabis use does not produce cognitive
impairment of comparable severity but there is suggestive
evidence that chronic cannabis use may produce subtle defects in
cognitive functioning, that may or may not be reversible after
abstinence. Fourth, there is reasonable evidence that chronic
heavy alcohol use produces impaired occupational performance in
adults and lowered educational achievements in adolescents. There
is at most suggestive evidence that chronic heavy cannabis use
produces similar, albeit more subtle impairments in occupational
and educational performance of adults. Fifth, there is good
evidence that chronic, heavy alcohol use increases the risk of
premature mortality from accidents, suicide and violence. There
is no comparable evidence for chronic cannabis use, although it
is likely that dependent cannabis users who frequently drive
while intoxicated with cannabis increase their risk of accidental
injury or death. Sixth, alcohol use has been accepted as a
contributory cause of cancer of the oropharangeal organs in men
and women. There is suggestive evidence that chronic cannabis
smoking may also be a contributory cause of cancers of the
aerodigestive tract (i.e. the mouth, tongue, throat, oesophagus,
lungs). <br>
Tobacco. The major adverse health effects shared by chronic
cannabis and tobacco smokers are chronic respiratory diseases,
such as chronic bronchitis, and probably, cancers of the
aerodigestive tract. The increased risk of cancer in the
respiratory tract is a consequence of the shared route of
administration by smoking. It is possible that chronic cannabis
smoking also shares the cardiotoxic properties of tobacco
smoking, although this possibility remains to be investigated. <br>
