<P>
The CRC for Aerospace Structures was formed in 1991 with the aim of providing an Australian focus for the development of advanced technologies to support an efficient, globally competitive Australian composite industry. This is achieved by the conduct of research and development programs on the design, manufacture, test and supportability of advanced composite structures.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
A primary focus of the centre is to produce demonstrator components which incorporate the technological advances developed in the various research programs. These demonstrators are vital to the transfer of technology from the research engineers to industry.
  Co-operative research and development programs are undertaken by post-graduate students and staff at the three sites of the CRC and also at those of the participating organisations. Major research facilities are available to some 80 staff working on three major research programs: improved manufacturing, structural performance and operations.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
The CRC has demonstrated an advanced aircraft-control surface which incorporates improved design and manufacturing technology. This control-surface technology played an important role for Hawker de Havilland in winning a major overseas contract for the design and manufacture of a composite flap.
Other technology based on resin transfer moulding and textile-based materials has helped the industry to develop cheaper manufacturing methods for a number of new products. Strong collaborative R&D programs with major overseas companies are based on the centre's design techniques for advanced composite applications.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The CRC has three commercial partners which have major export contracts. Hawker de Havilland and Aerospace Technologies of Australia export approximately $150-200 million annually of elaborately transformed products.
These companies have contacts with all the major overseas aircraft companies. Australian Defence Industries has recently been awarded one of the largest defence projects to build six minehunters for the Royal Australian Navy. The CRC is assisting the company develop the technology so it can become a major structural composite manufacturer.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Victoria is a major contributor to the Australian aircraft industry. Major participants offer access to excellent educational and research facilities.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
A Masters degree course has been developed at RMIT. A range of specialised short courses are offered to industry. So far these have
attracted 600 participants. The centre has 20 PhD students involved in its program.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The CRC offers smaller companies the opportunity to become involved in the R&D program by becoming Associate Members. This membership offers access to publications, an opportunity to influence research programs and special consultancy rates. The centre is a Registered Research Agency and undertakes contract research and development in all aspects of the design, manufacture and testing of composite structures.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The Australian Government provides annual funding at a rate of $3 million per year and the participants provide $5 million.
