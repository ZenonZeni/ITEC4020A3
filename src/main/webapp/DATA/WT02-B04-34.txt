</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>In order for the Internet to reach its full potential,
especially in the areas of financial transactions and communicating
sensitive personal and business-related information, computer
users must feel confident that their communications are safe and
secure.<P>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>The American computer industry has responded
to this need by developing state-of-the-art encryption products,
which encode information and communications to protect them from
unauthorized viewing or tampering. <P>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>Unfortunately, the Administration continues to
apply outdated controls on the export of American encryption products.
In fact, the strongest level of encryption currently allowed to
be exported was recently cracked by a college student in only
3 1/2 hours (using only the University's computers).<P>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>The Administration's antiquated policy ignores
the fact that strong encryption products are currently available
from foreign manufacturers and on the Internet. The market is
there -- but our computer industry is not being allowed to compete
on equal footing with our foreign competitors.  Also, the export
controls effectively limit the availability of encryption products
sold domestically because American companies need to be able to
sell a single product to the global market.<P>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>To add insult to injury, the Administration is
attempting to create a system, called &quot;key escrow&quot; or
&quot;key recovery&quot;, whereby computer users would be required
to give a copy of their keys to a government-approved third party
or place them in a central data bank. This is the technological
equivalent of requiring homeowners to give the government the
keys to their homes.<P>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Times Roman">The Solution -- The Security and Freedom through
Encryption (SAFE) Act, which:<BR>
</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>Gives all Americans the freedom to use any type
of encryption anywhere in the world, and allows the sale of any
type of encryption domestically; <P>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>Prohibits the government from creating a back
door into peoples' computer systems (mandatory key escrow);<P>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>Creates criminal penalties for the unlawful use
of encryption in furtherance of a crime -- up to 5 years imprisonment
for a first offense, and up to 10 years for each subsequent offense;
and<P>
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>Modernizes U.S. export controls to permit the
export of generally available software, and other types of software
and hardware under a license if a product with comparable security
is commercially available from foreign suppliers (creates a level
playing field).</FONT>
