<HR SIZE=4>
<P>The Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Maryland is a self-help and advocacy group whose members are relatives and friends of persons with serious mental illness, and mentally ill persons themselves.  We are more than 1,700 families in eighteen local affiliates in all parts of Maryland.  Our goals are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>To provide support to families who must cope with the problems presented by serious mental illness;
<LI>To educate our members and the public about serious mental illness in order to change perceptions and overcome stigma;
<LI>To advocate for a comprehensive system of care and treatment for persons with mental illness in every community in Maryland; and
<LI>To advocate for increased support for research about serious mental illness by private institutions and the government.
</UL>
<BR>
<P> 
We are affiliated with the  <A HREF="http://www.nami.org"> National Alliance for the Mentally Ill</A>, a national organization of over 1,000 affiliated groups in all 50 states and Canada.  All NAMI members share the same goals and work to achieve them on the national, state, and local levels.  All of us accept the findings of current scientific research that schizophrenia and the major affective disorders are biologically caused brain diseases.
</P>

<P>AMI of Maryland has 501(c)(3) (non-profit) status with the Internal Revenue Service.</P><BR>

<HR SIZE=4>


<P>AMI of Maryland was incorporated in 1983.  Representatives from AMI of Montgomery County and AMI of Baltimore worked together to create a state-wide organization.  The goal was to establish affiliates in all parts of Maryland and to work together to speak with one voice on Maryland public policy issues affecting  persons with severe and persistent mental illness. </P>

<P>Within a few years, there were 18 affiliates across Maryland.  AMI of Maryland formed coalitions with other organizations to work effectively with the State of  Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration and state legislators on issues such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI> the annual Mental Hygiene Administration fiscal budget priorities 
<LI> the rights of mentally ill persons in state facilities
<LI> development of 5 year plans for mental health services
<LI> insurance parity for mental health
<LI> the managed care Medicaid waiver

</UL>

<P>Our annual conventions help educate and inform our members and others interested in the welfare of persons with mental illness in Maryland.  Our conventions usually feature speakers on issues currently affecting those with mental illness, as well as lectures by key researchers on the latest news on advances in research on neurological brain disorders.  Workshops span a wide range of topics of interest.</P>

<P>Other activities include a quarterly newsletter and an annual fund-raising event.  AMI of Maryland usually has several state-wide projects active at any given time. Some of our current  projects:<P>
<UL>

<LI> Support of Care-Givers of Elderly Persons with Mental Illness
<LI> Opening Minds, Improving Lives - Anti-Stigma Campaign
<LI> Medicaid Managed Care/Service System
</UL>

<P>We will be starting the Journey of Hope program in the fall of 1996. The Journey of Hope program trains family members to provide courses on mental illness and advocacy to other family members.  Past projects include outreach to minorities and a project to strengthen our affiliates.</P>
