CONGRESS TO REVIEW BELL ATLANTIC-TCI DEAL,
ADMINISTRATION POSITION UNCLEAR

The antitrust implications of Bell Atlantic Corp.'s proposed
acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media
Corp. will be scrutinized by House and Senate Committees in
the near future. What remains unclear is what posture the
Clinton administration's Justice Department, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) or the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) will take with regard to the vertical integration of
network and programming interests represented by the merger
of the telephone and cable giants.

The merger, which ranks among the largest in U.S. history,
presents a potential dilemma for the administration, which has
made a point of emphasizing the private sector's leading role in
the development and financing of a national information
infrastructure.  The reliance on the private sector to hasten
bringing the benefits of an interactive infrastructure to the
nation may run smack into the long-standing Democratic
dedication to tough enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws.

Vice President Al Gore, the administration's point man on the
"information superhighway", issued a cautious statement.  "The
Administration believes that rapid deployment of the
information infrastructure will create jobs, increase our standard
of living, and provide a wide range of services in areas such as
education, health care, and entertainment," he said.

The merger "demonstrates the intense private-sector interest in
the information infrastructure.  The Administration supports any
development in the communications marketplace that is pro-
competitive and fosters the development of an open, interactive
information infrastructure.  Subsequent formal reviews will
determine whether this proposal meets those goals," Gore said.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) said the proposed merger will speed
up the information superhighway, but at the same time, the
chairman of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee said
he was concerned that access to that kind of technology would
only be available to the rich.  The merger proposal leaves many
questions unanswered and "raises all kinds of bells and whistles,"
Markey told ITP in an interview.  "Will it (access to the
information superhighway) happen for everyone, or only the
well-to-do?" he asked.  Markey added that he did not want the
nation to become divided into "the information rich and the
information poor."

It is the government's role to set the policy for the national
communications infrastructure with the private sector taking the
lead in building that system, he said.  "But in setting that policy
we must make certain that everyone participates in the future,"
Markey added.  The real challenge will be to see "who gets what
and when," he said. Those questions were not answered in the
Oct. 13 press conference announcing the proposed merger,
Markey said.

Markey said his panel will hold a series of hearings to examine
the many issues surrounding the merger, including the antitrust
implications.  At the same time, he asked the FCC to start a
formal inquiry to "assess the potential technological and market
bottlenecks created by mergers, acquisitions, and alliances
among cable, telephone, and computer companies."

In an Oct. 13 letter to acting FCC Chairman James Quello,
Markey said the Bell Atlantic-TCI announcement is "just the
latest tremor signalling the shifting nature of the
communications marketplace."  Specifically, Markey said the
FCC inquiry should address:

whether any recently proposed industry mergers, acquisitions, or
alliances creates an organization or alliance that controls
sufficient market dominance to "choke competition and stunt
innovation" in any area of the new video marketplace.

how the merging of regional Bell Operating Companies and
cable companies affects the competition in the current video
market and in the future broad communications market.

whether there should be continued restrictions on telephone
companies owning or operating cable systems within their service
territory.

whether the government should take additional steps to ensure
open systems in the communications marketplace, paying
particular attention to potential bottlenecks in video software
and set-top boxes and in encryption and compression
technologies for satellite distribution of video programming, and,

whether the recently adopted vertical and horizontal limits on
concentration in the cable industry are adequate to protect
consumers and/or competitors.

Markey told ITP there is "no question" more mergers and
alliances between telecommunications companies would be
announced in the future. This is not necessarily good or bad, he
added, but urged quick completion of the inquiry, which he told
Quello was needed "to ensure that the emerging marketplace
remains open and accessible to all and that some of the deals
now being made or contemplated do not result in either closed
systems or anti-competitive practices."

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX) said
"the question for consumers and competitors is whether such a
combination will open up new markets or technologies or simply
foreclose markets to current and potential entrants." Reserving
judgement on the competitive implication of the merger, Brooks
said that responsibility now rests with Assistant Attorney
General Anne Bingaman and her antitrust division.  Brooks said
he will monitor development "very closely" and consider the
implication of such mergers as he proceeds with his own
telecommunications legislation.

"Perhaps such integration is now a fact of life needed to deliver
the most innovative products to consumers.  But if that also
results in driving out creative small and mid-sized competitors,
we may all be the ultimate losers," Brooks said.

Reaction from Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-OH), chairman
of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, was not so measured.  He
"condemned" the proposed merger and called for hearings and
said he will urge Justice and the FTC to intervene.  "The TCI-
Bell Atlantic merger is a double whammy for consumers--they
could face overcharges for both cable TV and local phone
service," the statement said.  "Instead of lower prices from fierce
head-to-head competition between the phone and cable
companies, consumers are facing a mega-monster."

He warned of grave consequences if the merger is allowed to
continue.  "The more you concentrate programming and
economic power, the more you hurt consumers.  TCI, already a
giant in cable and programming, set its sights on expanding its
empire to the Home Shopping Network and now Paramount," he
said.  "Other industry giants like Viacom are also rejecting
competition in favor of combination.  The phone companies
promised us robust competition, but instead of trying to beat the
cable giants, they want to join them and consumers will be the
losers," Metzenbaum said.

Don Elder, a Federal Trade Commission spokesman, would
neither confirm nor deny the FTC is investigating the merger,
but noted that neither company is on its "early termination" list
of mergers and acquisitions given de facto approval.  The "early
termination" list is a daily report of business agreements the
FTC believes raise no antitrust issues.

By ITP's news deadline, neither Justice nor the FCC had a
reaction to the merger.  But some state regulators did.In Bell
Atlantic's home state of Pennsylvania, Vice Chairman of the
Public Utility Commission Joseph Rhodes Jr. viewed the
proposed merger with skepticism.  "In my opinion, Bell Atlantic
must prove to this commission that they can accomplish this
merger without divesting themselves of Bell of Pennsylvania," he
said.

"We have fought for years to determine if Bell of Pennsylvania
customers are unfairly subsidizing, for example, Bell Atlantic's
efforts at diversification such as its recently announced plans to
invest $1 billion in Mexico," he said.  "Bell Atlantic has fought
this audit at every juncture.  Imagine the difficulty we would
have to audit a merged Bell Atlantic-TCI.  Bell Atlantic
shareholders, not Bell of Pennsylvania ratepayers, should bear
the risk of this merger."

NIST SEEKS INDUSTRY VIEWS ON REVAMPING
ATP PROJECT-SELECTION PROCESS

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will
host a meeting Oct. 19 to solicit industry views on selecting
projects and establishing major program areas under the
Advance Technology Program (ATP). NIST Director Arati
Prabahkar and ATP Director George Uriano will be the
featured speakers at the meeting, which will be held at NIST
headquarters in Gaithersburg, Md.

With increased funding proposed in fiscal 1994 and the years
following, ATP will move from a pilot program to a full-fledged
civilian technology program.  The government is asking all
interested parties for their ideas for new program areas that
should be included in the ATP.  Since 1990, 60 projects have
been funded through ATP.  This does not include the projects
that will be funded this year with remaining monies for fiscal
1993, which ended Sept. 30.  That announcement, which could
include up to 30 projects, is likely before the end of the month,
a NIST official said.  ATP funding for FY-93 was $67.9 million.

At ITP's news deadline, House and Senate negotiators were
close to approving a budget for FY-94 that aides say will
probably reflect the $199.5 million proposed by the Clinton
administration.  The House earlier had cut the president's
request to $129 million (ITP, June 28, p. 1).  The
administration's intention is to ramp up the program by 275
percent until it reaches $750 million by FY-97.

The meeting with industry is the best avenue on getting ideas for
the best return on tax dollars, said a NIST spokesman.  "The
idea is to explain our intention to establish areas for more tightly
focused research and what the criteria shall be for selecting what
those program areas are," the spokesman said.  Program areas
would encompass a group of projects with a common feature
that works toward a specific technology or a business goal, he
explained.  Project proposals would still have to compete under
previously determined criteria published in the Federal Register
as part of the ATP project solicitation.  Ideas for program areas
will be accepted at any time, while proposals for specific projects
under the ATP could only be accepted in response to an ATP
solicitation, which last occurred in February.

Selection criteria for the program areas will also be discussed at
the meeting. In a notice for the meeting, NIST said it intends
the program areas to have "well-defined technology and
economic goals, and generally will require development of an
ensemble of complementary technologies."  The shift to focused
competitions centered around specific programs "will allow the
ATP to achieve greater benefits for the nation by concentrating
support on suites of interrelated technologies and reaping the
benefits of scale and synergism," according to the agency.

To register for the meeting, or to receive documents distributed
at the meeting after Oct. 19, contact the ATP office at 1-800-
micf.nist.gov, or by
facsimile at (301) 926-9524.

HOUSE SCIENCE PANEL READYING NEW MEASURE
TO SPUR DEVELOPMENT OF `GREEN' TECHNOLOGIES

The House Science Committee's proposed legislation on "green"
technology should be finalized and ready for introduction within
the next few weeks, according to committee sources.  And while
a previously circulated one-page outline of the proposal has been
rendered "obsolete," many key initiatives still remain on the
drawing board as the committee aims to craft legislation that
would encourage the development and adoption of green
technologies by the government and private sector.

Environmental, or "green" technologies include both the
traditional technologies for "pollution control and clean-up, as
well as `other' products and processes that provide significant
environmental and economic benefits," said Rep. Tim Valentine
(D-NC) chairman of the subcommittee on technology,
environment and aviation at an Oct. 5 hearing.  "It is this latter
group of technologies that has the potential for widespread
impact across many industries," Valentine said.

But now, with a renewed emphasis on the environment led by
top officials in the Clinton administration including Vice
President Al Gore, both government officials and representatives
of the private sector are calling for incentives for government-
public partnerships, financial incentives to develop new
technologies and relief from too stringent regulatory
requirements.  "Flexible, performance-based regulation that
stimulates innovation for both environmental and economic
benefits will have to be a collaborative exercise," said Pete
Howard, vice president of environmental affairs for Georgia-
Pacific Corp.

DETAILS OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION

At ITP's news deadline, committee members were still reviewing
each section of the proposed legislation, suggesting additions and
fine tuning other areas.  The "framework is still being cleaned
up," said one committee aide involved in drafting the legislation.
Also, the legislative language is being modified for consistency.
For example, this would eliminate any confusion over the terms
"green technology" and "environmental technology," the aide
said.

The proposed legislation is originating in the panel's
subcommittee on technology, environment and aviation.  The
legislation is expected to address:

Greater coordination among government agencies involved in
the development and adoption of green technologies;
establishing an Environment and Technology Clearinghouse; and
enhancing the capability for life cycle assessments of material
flows.

Greater emphasis on green technologies in existing programs;
establishing an Innovative Environmental Technologies Awards
Program; promoting the development of Environmental
Remediation and Monitoring Technology; establishing an
Industrial Integration Demonstration Project; and creating a
President's Total Environmental Quality Award.

Encouraging green technology projects in Small Business
Innovation Research grants; promoting the government as a
market to accelerate the development of green technologies;
evaluating the impact of regulatory practices on the contribution
of innovation to pollution prevention, control and remediation.

Promoting industry education and outreach; integrating
environmental sustainability issues into engineering education;
enhancing public knowledge of sustainable development through
the National Science Foundation.

Improving technical standards of environmental performance
and efficacy; providing guidelines for consumer claims.

Improving international assistance promoting green technologies;
establishing an International Environmental Technology Center;
enhancing export financing (steps the Clinton administration has
already begun); improving benchmarking; and clarifying the
potential for international green markets.

Partnerships between government and the private sector that
include risk sharing should be encouraged, said government and
private sector representatives at another recent congressional
hearing.  Representatives from both sides also called for
financial incentives and regulatory relief.

"We have started a dialogue with American companies who want
to collaborate to share the risks of technology development with
(the Environmental Protection Agency) and other federal
agencies," senior EPA official Walter Kovalick said in testimony
Sept. 30 before a Senate environment subcommittee.

As far as specific provisions in the proposed House legislation,
financial incentives remain under consideration, but committee
sources say the proposal most likely will call for a study to
determine what incentives would be the most viable. There are
so many tax incentives now available to companies that it doesn't
make sense to impose a specific standard, said one source.

HOUSE JUDICIARY PANEL HEARS SOFTWARE
INDUSTRY LEADERS DISCUSS COMPETITION, TRADE
PRACTICES

Against the background of a possible Justice Department
investigation into alleged anticompetitive trade practices by
industry leader Microsoft Corp., executives from some of the
nation's leading computer software firms went before a House
Judiciary subcommittee last week to discuss competition in the
computer industry.  Chief among the concerns of the industry
officials was competition from overseas computer firms, software
piracy and trade restrictions that hamper the ability of U.S. firms
to effectively compete with their foreign counterparts.

Outdated, "unrealistic, unilateral controls that effectively prohibit
exports of software with encryption capabilities" imposed by the
United States must be lifted, said William Neukom, vice
president of law and corporate affairs for Microsoft.  Neukom
argued that these trade barriers threaten the industry's future
international sales.  The Clinton administration has proposed
liberalizing export restrictions on computers but not encryption
software.  That position has been criticized by the Software
Publishers' Association (ITP, Sept. 6, p. 12).  He also said that
software piracy, which is rampant in many areas, costs U.S.
companies approximately $10 billion annually in foreign
revenues.

Innovation must continue to be encouraged, Neukom said.  "The
benefits of continuous software innovation permeate the
economy" as software innovation improves the competitiveness
of other U.S. industries that utilize software products, he said.
Neukom also noted that the competitiveness of the computer
industry means that "not all companies that exist today will be as
successful or even in existence five years from now."
Competition will increase overall, he said, as firms vie "to
develop more advanced operating systems that take advantage of
the explosive technological growth in hardware."

David Bradford, general counsel of Novell, Inc. told the
lawmakers that congressional efforts to clarify the treatment of
joint ventures under the antitrust laws and to eliminate any
unnecessary obstacles to their formation was a boost to the
industry's ability to compete internationally.

But one area that still needs improvement is the patent system,
according to Jerry Rogers, president and chief executive officer
of Cyrix Corp.  "America must address its antiquated patent
system so that it may encourage innovation rather than hinder
it," Rogers said.  The Cyrix official claims that "under the
present system patents are issued that reflect marginal advances
in technology or a similar implementation of existing
manufacturing process or product" which in turn advances large
corporations while intimidating smaller companies.

In general, the witnesses side-stepped discussing the alleged
trade practice violations by Microsoft. However, Paul Johnson, a
vice president of First Boston, testified that the government must
"make sure that the current dominant market leaders do not
abuse their natural economies of scale."

Johnson said, "In other words, Microsoft clearly dominates the
market for PC operating systems and applications.  No one can
deny it, and I doubt anything could be done to change it.
However, Microsoft should not be allowed to abuse this market
position in terms of pricing leverage or `anti-competitive'
activities," he said.  Justice is reviewing files compiled by the
Federal Trade Commission to determine if Microsoft has
engaged in anticompetitive practices (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 12).

While noting that the computer industry is "fast-moving and
complex," Subcommittee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Texas) said
that does not mean "it is immune from antitrust and other
competition-related problems."

At the same time, Brooks pointed out that such characteristics
do not mean "that the market would necessarily be served by the
replacement of one dominant industry monolith with a number
of smaller companies able to unfairly exert control over
particular key segments of the computer industry."  Brooks also
stressed that as long as federal agencies are investigating charges
of unfair competitive practices within the industry, his committee
did not intend "to invade upon that process."

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES PILOT PROGRAM
FOR NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

The House Telecommunications Subcommittee approved
legislation Oct. 14 to fund pilot projects that promote the
development of a national information superhighway.  The
Telecommunications Infrastructure and Facilities Assistance Act
of 1993, H.R. 2639, authorizes grant money for communities or
organizations that develop innovative uses for nationwide
computer networks.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee and
key sponsor of the proposal, said the measure "reflects the
commitment of the government to make certain that health care
institutions, schools, libraries and local governments share in the
communications future."

To fund the pilot projects, the bill will have the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
establish and maintain a Telecommunications and Information
Infrastructure Development Program that will promote the
widespread availability of advanced telecommunications to health
care providers, educational institutions and state and local
governments.

Markey said the program "is designed to support the formation
of a nationwide, high-speed, interactive infrastructure made up
of a variety of technologies through the interconnection and
improvement of existing facilities and the deployment of new
facilities."  The bill authorizes an additional $151 million in
Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996 for NTIA to award grants for 50
percent of construction costs.

SPACE STATION BECOMES FOREIGN POLICY VEHICLE;
JOINT VENTURE WITH RUSSIA PROPOSED

Dr. John H. Gibbons, director of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), announced Oct. 6 that
the United States will incorporate the Russian Mir space station
into the newly redesigned and recently renamed space station
Alpha project, formerly called space station Freedom.

The new space station option grew out of a meeting held Sept. 1
and 2 between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.  Under the terms of the
agreement reached between Gore and Chernomyrdin, the
United States will pay $400 million over four years for the use of
Mir and the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.  In return,
the U.S. will receive assurances from Russia that it will abide by
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the agreement to
limit the spread of rockets and related technologies.  China and
Brazil have been accused of breaking the MTCR, and many fear
that cash-strapped Russia might find it unable to resist selling
banned technology.

Marcia S. Smith, a specialist in science and technology policy for
the Congressional Research Service, emphasized that the Mir
option is only one of three choices emerging from the confusion
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA)
efforts to redesign and trim costs for the space station.  The
three designs are the "American option"; using a Lockheed Corp.
"bus" for guidance navigation and control; the
"American/Russian" option, using a Salyut tug for the same
functions; and the "Russian/American" option developed during
the Gore/Chernomyrdin discussions.

The latest announcement comes on the heels of a rocky year for
the project, which is criticized for being over budget and a waste
of precious federal science funds at a time of record budget
shortfalls.  In a packed hearing room before the subcommittee
on space of the House Committee of Science, Space and
Technology, Gibbons defended the option to employ Mir as a
means of cutting both deployment time and expenses.  Members
of the panel voiced skepticism about the uncertainty raised by
issues such as the attempted coup quashed by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, sovereignity and control, and technical difficulties
in linking the two programs.

The new modular design, a composite of two out of three plans
submitted by NASA in June after the Clinton administration
demanded a less expensive station, would include Mir as a
component of a larger station.  Gibbons stated that Mir would
provide the U.S. with a quick boost in knowledge while
providing Russians with needed capital to help that country's
economic development.  "We now have the historic opportunity
to combine our efforts in space across a spectrum of programs,"
Gibbons testified.  "Not in the context of an adversarial
relationship, but rather, one that is based on cooperation and
partnership.  We believe that the steps taken during the
Gore/Chernomyrdin meeting will set us on a course that will
allow us to work together on space activities to minimize costs,
maximize research potential and reduce the time needed to do
projects."

COLLABORATION WOULD OCCUR IN THREE PHASES


The Russian/American collaboration would occur in three-
phases.  The first phase would give the U.S. the right to fly long-
term missions on Mir to develop skills needed for future space
station operations.  Phase two would begin shuttle service to a
Mir module as an "interim human-tended science facility."  The
third phase would be full-scale integration of the Russian space
program into the international space-station consortium currently
led by the U.S.  Other members of the consortium include
Canada, European countries and Japan.  Gibbons said details
will be made available Nov. 1.

Gibbons fended off a series of questions, on the one hand
assuring Rep. Jim Bacchus (D-FL) that the space station
program would continue to be based at Cape Canaveral (in
Bacchus' district), while assuring others on the committee that
neither extra money would be appropriated for the proposed
joint venture nor any American jobs put at risk.

"No one should confuse the course we are charting as
relinquishing control of the Space Station or exporting jobs out
of the U.S.," Gibbons said.  "In developing this cooperative
program, we are focusing on areas that will not negatively impact
the U.S. aerospace sector.  In some areas, such as dynamic solar
power and closed life support systems, we believe that the net
gain of new technologies from the Russians could stimulate jobs
in the U.S."

The most contentious issues, however, were the most technical.
Integration of the two space station projects reveals fundamental
technical differences between the programs that may make
joining them difficult.  The Russian/American space station
program would use a 51.6 degrees orbit, as opposed to the space
shuttle, which has always used a 28 degrees orbit.  Adopting to
the new orbit would reduce the launch window from Florida to
six minutes every day while simultaneously increasing the need
for thrust or reducing the size of payloads.

Responding to a question from Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner
(R-WI), Gibbons said the orbital degrees can range from 42 to
52 degrees, but that Russia could not lower itself to our orbit
without risking dropping its spent rockets on China.

Increasing the thrust of the space shuttle probably would require
the continuation of another controversial NASA project, the
advanced solid rocket motor (ASRM).  Ironically, on the
morning of the hearing, the House voted not to consider a rule
change that would have allowed appropriations for ASRM to
continue despite being voted down.  Other options, according to
Gibbons, are to let the Europeans or Russians "do the heavy
lifting."

All of this could become moot, according to Gibbons.  "What we
have is a space station called Alpha that is destined to go
forward with or without Russia," he said.  The proposed $400
million investment will buy "access to the great reservoir of
experience from the Mir," he said.

At a subsequent hearing Oct. 14, NASA Administrator Daniel
Goldin dismissed concerns by some panel members that Russian
technology might be uniformly inferior.  Goldin noted that in
recent years, Russia has made more launches and had fewer
failures than the U.S. space program.  Collaborating with the
Russians will allow the launch of the laboratory module by July
1997, with completion of a new space station by April 2001 at a
savings of $3.5 billion over what it wold cost the U.S. to
complete the project without Russian assistance.  If collaboration
does not occur, Goldin said the laboratory module launch would
be delayed until April 1998 and the space station until Sept.
2003.

OMB OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NEW GOVERNMENT
EFFORT TO USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

The state of information technology within the government when
the Clinton administration took office was "appalling," according
to Sally Katzen, administrator of the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget.
Testifying Oct. 7 before the House Space, Science and
Technology Committee, Katzen said an essential component of
the National Performance Review (NPR) will require
overhauling the way the government uses, manages and
disseminates its vast store of information.  Noting that the
government has spent staggering sums yearly on information
systems without providing decent service or significantly
improving information infrastructure, Katzen said the two
programs must be integrated to ensure that the goals of either
program are achievable.

According to the NPR report "From Red Tape to Results"
released Sept. 7, more efficient use of information technology is
one of the administration's highest priorities both for improving
government services and reducing costs. The review projects a
savings of up to $5.4 billion over five years by bringing the way
government distributes data into the information age, while at
the same time improving citizen- access to information.  Efforts
to improve information technologies in the past have been
hampered by bad management and programs lacking central
goals or leadership, according to Katzen.

"The federal government's track record in integrating
[information technology] into systems supporting its operations
has produced some successes--and some costly failures," Katzen
testified.  "Despite spending $25 billion in fiscal year 1993 on
information technology, the federal government lacked the
strong and effective leadership required to assure that it makes
the most of these resources."  Without leadership, Katzen
continued, systems developed to deal with small and specific
problems actually aggravate dissemination problems because
separate departments create information fiefdoms--databases
that duplicate those of other agencies and departments.  This,
Katzen said, exacerbates the perception of government as a poor
service-provider and drives up government costs in general.

"In the past, the oversight community--OMB, the General
Services Administration, Congressional committees and the
Inspectors General--has often aggravated the situation by
overemphasizing specific costs such as the acquisition cost of
individual information technology projects, rather than assessing
their effect on program delivery," she said.

THREE STEPS TO INTEGRATION

Katzen proposed a three-step process to integrate the goals of
the National Information Infrastructure (NII) and the National
Performance Review.  Beginning immediately, her office will
evaluate and publicize successful government information
technology ventures across departments and agencies.  This will
aid other departments in determining what programs are
available and effective.

The second phase, which will cover the next 12 to 18 months, is
to "achieve measurable performance gains through fundamental
changes in information management practices."  Katzen
described a possible program, allowing the Department of
Veteran Affairs access to Department of Defense personnel data
on the assumption that there is significant overlap between the
departments.  This would not only save the departments the cost
of having to input the same information twice, but would save
military personnel the aggravation of having to supply it several
times.

The third step would be "to tie the short- and long-term efforts
together" by determining what laws and regulations should be
established, changed or abolished to make the best use of
information gained during the first two steps.

More efficient use of information will also make it easier for the
government to encourage the development of a national
information infrastructure.  The federal government, being the
largest information provider in the country, will provide
significant traffic on any "information highway" that develops.
Moving public information to the network, as outlined in the
reinventing government report, will provide a flood of traffic on
the network.  This will encourage public use and, in turn, will
build the network.

Katzen testified that among the services likely to be more
efficient using NII would be an "integrated electronic benefit
transfer" (EBT) system.  This system would move entitlement
payments from the check- and paper-based systems used today
to an automated teller machine, bank-wire network and plastic
access system.  "In the Food Stamp program alone, there are
over 26 million monthly recipients and the government spends
$400 million annually just to print, distribute and ultimately
destroy stamps," Katzen said.  "EBT adopts commercial
electronic payment practices for the delivery of government
assistance services, enabling benefits to be transferred
automatically."

Other links between the NII and NPR would include heightening
public access to government services through the creation of
information kiosks for retirees so they can access social security
or other information; a national network to link federal state
and local law enforcement and public safety agencies to increase
coordination and reaction times; a national environmental
database that would combine the information gathered by the
Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection
Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the
Department of Commerce and others; and a government-wide e-
mail system.

Katzen said that, as part of NPR, agencies should be encouraged
to work more closely with the information industry and be
provided with incentives to innovate.  Among her suggestion
were:

permit agencies to retain a portion of any savings that their
innovations create, instead of the current system in which
agencies that do not expend their full appropriations find their
budgets reduced the following fiscal year;

promote performance-based contracting, instead of narrowly
defined, low-risk procurement, allowing agencies to leverage the
expertise of the contractor with award fees, performance
incentives and value engineering;

use multi-year funding, which would free information managers
from year-to-year appropriations battles; and

establish a government-wide venture capital fund to promote
partnership between government and industry to develop new
technologies.

Finally, Katzen said the most important aspect of making the
NII and NPR work together would be rigorous and constant
retraining of government workers to keep abreast of new
technologies.  "Many members of the federal workforce lack
sufficient training and background to use new technologies
effectively, and many managers fail to realize the importance
of...training,"  she said.  "Even though the government spends
billions of dollars each year on information technology, contracts
and acquisitions do not include training provisions in the initial
design stages."

U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE
IS AT THE CENTER OF ECONOMY

Under Bruce A. Lehman, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
will be on a "quest for quality and customer service" during the
next several years.  Lehman was sworn in as assistant secretary
of commerce and commissioner of the Patent Office on Sept. 15.
He intends to continue a multi-year automation plan for systems
serving the agency's main activities--patent and trademark
processing, information dissemination and administration.  The
slow pace of patent processing in the past has prompted
congressional criticism, but Lehman believes that "automation
may open the way for truly international patent searching--
maybe even to a world patent."

Many still regard patents and other intellectual property rights as
esoteric subjects.  But this view is not held by corporations,
universities, government research centers and others who
increasingly seek patents here and overseas for their new
products or processes.  Governments have also realized the
importance patents play in the technology competitiveness race,
and many have begun to modernize their national patent offices
to meet demand and to benefit from new information-handling
and storage technologies.  In addition, patent office directors are
being urged to charge "user fees" that reflect the real costs of
providing services to inventors and patent attorneys.
Automation may offer an economic solution that serves well
both government agencies and patent applicants.

In existence since 1790, the Patent and Trademark Office
expects to deal with about 188,000 patents and 142,000
trademark applications this year, and estimates that it will collect
fees of about $486 million.  From its offices in Arlington, Va., a
staff of 4,893 receive, examine and process America's
technological hopes for the future.  As a link to the health of
technology-based industries, Lehman said his office "stands at
the very [center] of a technology-based economy."  It is
surprising that the Patent Office does not come under the aegis
of the Commerce Department's newly empowered Technology
Administration, as do the National Institute of Standards and
Technology and the National Technical Information Service.

Nevertheless, Lehman sees new opportunities for his agency.
For example, through the recently announced Information
Infrastructure Task Force, he will lead an Intellectual Property
Working Group looking into policies that will encourage use of
the new infrastructure.  His group will investigate ways of
ensuring "copyright integrity" for creators of information and
entertainment products, as well as investigate the relationship of
"standards" and "open systems" to copyright law and "fair use"
principles in the context of electronic superhighways.

As part of the new U.S.-Japan trade-framework agreement, the
Patent Office will be leading the U.S. government side on all
intellectual property issues in these negotiations.  "Few
assignments given to the Commissioner of the Patent Office
have been more important that this one," Lehman said.

NO LONGER A DICKENSIAN BACKWATER

Once a Dickensian backwater of information-handling with dusty
shelves of dog-eared papers, shoe-box filing systems, primitive
copying machines and constant vulnerability to fire and rodent
damage, today's Patent Office is being equipped with automation
systems so its operations can run with fewer staff yet achieve
faster response times.  These computerized systems include
workstations with state-of-the-art graphic interfaces for
examiners and networks of databases with foreign patent
organizations.  Increasingly, CD-ROM formats are used for
storing and searching current and past patent records.

Lehman recognizes that automation alone doesn't immediately
improve the quality or efficiency of its services.  "I believe that
[quality] is closely linked in any organization with morale," he
said.  To increase morale, Lehman will review the Patent
Office's structure and in particular the patent examining corps
and its support functions.  Lehman hopes to identify changes
which will give improved support for examiners and create a
better sense of teamwork and customer service in all employees.
Furthermore, examiners may be offered new career development
opportunities--such as being detailed to other federal agencies--
to broaden their experience and perspective.

Concern has been voiced by Patent Office insiders and
intellectual property lawyers about efforts to reduce patent
pendency (the time it takes for a patent to be issued or an
application to be rejected), and whether this is being achieved
partly at the expense of the quality of examination.  Lehman
said the basis for this concern is that the patent examining corps'
performance criteria emphasize production rather than "quality"
in the examination process.  Ongoing quality audits by the
agency's in-house patent quality review unit suggests that quality
is improving; however, Lehman said the criteria used to judge
examiners needs a closer look to see if changes could provide
incentives for quality equal to those encouraging production.

In a new mission statement for the Patent Office, Commerce
Secretary Ronald H. Brown recently defined its role as:

Administering the laws relating to patents and trademarks so as
to promote U.S. industrial and technological progress and
strengthen the national economy;

Developing and advising the secretary and the administration on
intellectual property policy, including copyright matters; and

 Advising the secretary and other U.S. government agencies,
such as the U.S. trade representative, on trade-related aspects of
intellectual property in cooperation with the International Trade
Administration.

One of Lehman's urgent tasks will be to consider the possible
adoption of the first-to-file patent system as a prelude to the
Patent Harmonization Treaty.  Presently the United States uses
a first-to-invent approach but is the only developed country using
it.  First-to-file and other changes recommended by an Advisory
Commission on Patent Law Reform in September 1992, would
permit integration of the United States into an international
patent system.  A consensus initially appeared to support
adopting them but has since deteriorated and Lehman will hold
public hearings and solicit new comments on the matter.  A
recent General Accounting Office report found that 66 percent
of the companies it surveyed were in favor of the change.

Despite his background in intellectual property, Lehman seems
unlikely to be a prisoner of the system.  Addressing American
Bar Association members in New York recently, he said "It's my
desire to develop a better mechanism for making and exercising
the office's obligation to make policy in a variety of areas
involving patent, trademark and copyright systems.  All too often
[the Patent Office] had been a passive bystander as technology,
the courts or Congress have forced it into reacting to a limited
number of policy choices.  Many historic decisions as to
patentability of a new art have been made in a `Star Chamber'
proceeding in the commissioner's office with only a few insiders
present and nothing more to go on than the information
supplied by one patent applicant.  I intend to reverse this
process."  Lehman is drawing up a list of areas of "turmoil" and
will hold public hearings on the policy options involved.  Topics
likely to be examined are computer-related inventions,
particularly software, and biotechnology inventions.  Perhaps in a
few more years, Lehman speculated, the ability to examine
patents using a desk-top personal computer may lead us to
question whether we even need a centralized patent office any
longer.

DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY ENLISTED
IN WAR AGAINST BREAST CANCER

The Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and Fischer Imaging Corp. of Denver signed a
cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) last
week to create a new mammography system that will allow
earlier detection of breast cancer.

The three-year, $3.28 million agreement will utilize an imaging
technology previously developed for weapons applications.
Fischer is funding 73 percent of the project.  While both DOE
and Fischer will contribute "nearly equally" in the initial r&d
phase, according to DOE, Fischer will support the clinical trials
and the approval process before the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).

After devoting three years to solving technical problems, it is
expected to take another two years to prove the system works in
clinical tests and to obtain FDA approval.  The research phase is
estimated to cost less that $2 million, with the clinical trials and
approval process costing another $1.5 million.

Specifically, the CRADA is aimed at "developing a new imaging
system that will produce clearer images using less radiation, thus
enabling earlier and more accurate detection of breast cancer
and the saving of lives," according to DOE.  The CRADA
partners will develop a device that eliminates the use of X-ray
film, and instead uses sophisticated detectors to directly record
the X-ray image in digital form.  The detector array employs
charge coupled devices (CCDs) to record 20 million individual
pixels, each 30 times smaller than the period at the end of a
sentence.  Since the image is digital, a computer can be used to
enhance the image.

At the signing ceremony held in Washington on Oct. 6, Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary said "Health care is technology
intensive and the battle for better, safer and cheaper health care
demands that we use every weapon at our disposal.  The
national laboratories are a vital element in our technology
arsenal, and this agreement shows that we are using the
laboratories to help wage the battle for improved health care."
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said the agreement "is a
breakthrough in the area of defense conversion and a
breakthrough in the fight against an epidemic."

Also, the technology commercialized under this agreement is
expected to hasten the widespread use of "telemedicine" insofar
as it will allow transmission of images over information
highways, facilitating communication between radiologists.  Dr.
Faina Shtern, head of the Diagnostic Imaging Research Branch
of the National Cancer Institute, praised the project and said,
"While digital mammography is still under development, its
potential to improve breast cancer management warrants further
research."

CANADIAN BELL SCIENTIST CLAIMS TO CRACK
DES ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM; NIST CONSIDERING
REVIEW

A Canadian computer scientist claims to have designed a
machine to crack the federal government's Data Encryption
Standard (DES), merely by searching random numbers at high-
speeds for a few hours.  Michael J. Wiener, a scientist with Bell-
Northern Research in Ottawa, presented the paper at a
conference in August.  A spokeswoman for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, whose scientists originally
designed the DES algorithm in 1981, said they first saw the
document Oct. 13 and have not yet evaluated Weiner's blueprint.
DES is used widely in computer communications.

The heart of the machine is a special chip that Weiner said can
test the keys "at the impressive rate of 50 million per second," by
eliminating the need to feed data in and out of the chip while it
is running. Wiener undertook designing the chip and explaining
how it works in a 47-page document "for the purpose of
assessing the resistance of DES to an exhaustive attack," he said.
By using this attack, "DES keys can be found one to two orders
of magnitude faster than other recently proposed designs."
Wiener said his design shows how to build a machine for $1
million that will break DES in about 3.5 hours.

"The chip can be comfortably clocked at 50 MHz," slower than
the chips which run a 486 computer, "and would cost $10.50 to
manufacture," Wiener said.  In the machine, ten key search chips
are controlled by a "microcontroller" which searches for codes.
The machine uses 12 groups of 10 chips, controlled by a master
microcontroller to form a "shelf."  "Four shelves are contained to
form a frame which is controlled by a PC.  A frame costs
$100,000 and contains 5760 key search chips," the document said.

DES CRACKED `ALARMINGLY QUICKLY'

"USING the design described here, DES keys can be found
alarmingly quickly," Weiner wrote.  Given that a key search chip
tests 50 million keys per second and a frame costs $100,000 and
contains 5760 chips, he computed the following approximate
search-time-to-cost ratios:  A $100,000 machine would take 35
hours to crack the code; a $1 million machine would take 3.5
hours; and a $10 million machine would take only 21 minutes.
He said a machine could be built in ten months by three people.
With labor, support and manufacturing, Weiner estimated a
simple machine would cost a total of $500,000 to build.

DES may be replaced by the new Clipper Chip data encryption
algorithm called "skipjack," an allegedly impenetrable encryption
algorithm introduced by the Clinton administration in April.  In
an independent review of the Clipper Chip, Georgetown
University Computer Science Professor Dorothy Denning said it
would be 36 years before the cost of breaking skipjack by
exhaustive search will be equal to the cost of breaking the Data
Encryption Standard today.  "Thus, there is no significant risk
that Skipjack will be broken by exhaustive search in the next 30
to 40 years," Denning said (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 13).

Wiener told ITP that his research was intended as an exercise to
help DES users asses the strength of the encryption.  He
emphasized that he has not built a machine, but only provided
the blueprints for a chip, and that NIST has not commented on
his work.  He added that cracking DES did not imply that the
same key search techniques could be used to crack the Clipper
Chip "skipjack" algorithm.  "Certainly all encryption systems are
more or less vulnerable.  It depends on the size of the keys."
Noting that skipjack used very large keys, he said it would not be
practical to attack with random key searches.

David Banisar, a policy analyst for Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, a public interest organization that monitors
encryption policy, said the code-breaking chip is significant
because it creates in practice what has previously been proposed
only in theory.  "He's actually gone through with a computer-
aided design program and designed the chip, which nobody had
done before," Banisar said.  Weiner noted that DES could still
remain foolproof if its algorithm was tripled in each use.  If used
in this way, the encryption code in effect becomes numerically
"larger than the national debt spread around the earth and moon
in orbit," Banisar added.

MEMBER STATES' WORRIES SLOW
EC PROGRESS ON R&D FRAMEWORK PLAN

BRUSSELS--Work is proceeding slowly on the European
Commission's proposal for a new EC framework program for
r&d.  EC research ministers discussed this proposal, which is the
fourth in a series of four-year programs, for EC funding last
June and they were scheduled to do so again Oct. 11.

All 12 member states have expressed serious reservations about
the commission's proposal.  The difficulties mainly concern the
proposed budget of 13 billion ECUs (1 ECU = $1.17) from 1994
to 1998.  But selection criteria for r&d program support also are
controversial.  The budget figures put forward by EC member
states vary from 6.5 billion to 14 billion ECUs.  Generally, it is
expected that member states will try to narrow this range to
some figure below 13 billion ECUs.  That sentiment concerns
the commission, whose staff believes a budget of 13 billion
ECUs is the minimum necessary for the EC to support r&d.

Most member states still disagree with the commission's
distribution of funds within research categories, but it seems
clear that they agree on reducing funding for communications
and information technology.  The commission and member
states want to give their final approval to this framework
program in December.  This goal is ambitious.  The problems
cited above are substantial.

INTELSAT GROUP TO STUDY PRIVATIZATION
IN RESPONSE TO REQUEST BY U.S. OFFICIALS

A special Intelsat working party has agreed to a U.S. proposal to
include the privatization of the global satellite consortium on the
group's agenda of strategic issues for further study.

Representatives of the U.S. government and the U.S. signatory,
Comsat Corp., proposed that the working party include on its
agenda a study of the implications of converting Intelsat from
"an international, intergovernmental organization into a private
multinational corporation," an informed source told ITP.  The
working party met in Washington last month following the
conclusion of the Intelsat Board of Governors meeting Sept. 9 to
15.  The meeting was convened to establish an agenda of key
issues for Intelsat's future that need near-term study.

An Intelsat spokesman confirmed that "the issue of privatization
is on the agenda" of the working group but noted that the group
was charged by Intelsat's Assembly of Parties last November
with studying a host of strategic issues.  "It would almost be
remiss if they didn't consider privatization," he said, "but it is not
a foregone conclusion.  We're not looking at it to happen
tomorrow or two years from now, but there's obviously a
possibility it could happen over the long term."

The working group originally had been formed to consider
responses to calls by the United States and some other member
nations for a loosening of requirements under Article XIV(d) of
the Intelsat Agreement for consultations with Intelsat before
member nations permit the use of separate satellite systems for
international services.

The U.S. proposal to look at a privatization of Intelsat reflected
a view by U.S. government policy-makers that Intelsat needs the
greatest possible flexibility to meet growing international satellite
service competition, sources said.  "Increasingly, it's a strain for
the U.S. government to try and mediate battles between Intelsat
and its competitors, when we believe Intelsat needs greater
flexibility, and its competitors say it shouldn't have that flexibility
while it retains the treaty privileges and immunities," one U.S.
government source said.  "So, it seems to make sense to consider
this--the option of privatization and the pros and cons."

In their presentations to the Intelsat working party, U.S.
government and Comsat representatives reportedly made it clear
that the United States is committed to Intelsat remaining
economically competitive and that it recognizes "the universal
service principles inherent in the Intelsat agreements" and the
fact that Intelsat remains the only provider of satellite services
with global reach.

TOUGH CHOICES FACE U.S. MANUFACTURING
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE TOLD

The U.S. government should adopt an "industrial development
policy" to provide guidance to small and medium-sized
manufacturing companies, said Philip Braverman, senior vice
president and chief economist of DKB Securities Corp, Oct. 5 at
a Joint Economic Committee hearing chaired by Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D-IN).

Braverman said such businesses were "likely to benefit most
from a stream of information and suggestions on where their
investment dollars might be most expeditiously placed and which
are the most likely avenues for productive research."  He also
suggested holding regional, industry-wide meetings attended by
top people in various fields to "plan collectively" for the future.

"Recognized experts in various high-technology disciplines could
be invited to take `dollar-a-year' government positions to foster
progress in their fields," Braverman said.  Pilot projects, modeled
after the recently announced government and industry
partnership to develop an environmentally correct car, should be
encouraged.

Braverman was one of three witnesses before the committee--all
of whom agreed that difficult choices confront U.S.
manufacturing in its efforts to deal with declining jobs,
intensified foreign competition and sluggish adoption of new
technologies.  The hearing examined recent statistics of
manufacturing job losses and the prospects for halting or slowing
this trend through stimulating U.S. manufacturing growth,
possibly using new technologies.

Hamilton expressed concern over the latest unemployment
figures, saying they showed that each month the equivalent of
one-and-a-half Fortune 500 company's employees lost their jobs
in the nation's manufacturing sector and this posed serious
questions about the future of America's manufacturing
capabilities for domestic as well as export markets.

Hamilton's remarks were put into national perspective by Julie
Fox Gorte, senior associate at the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment (OTA).  She said that more than 18
million Americans, or 15 percent of the U.S. workforce, were
employed in manufacturing.

Generally these were "jobs with better pay and superior benefits
than the average for production and nonsupervisory workers,"
Gorte said "[so] people who lose manufacturing jobs typically
find replacements only with either lower pay, fewer benefits or
both.  For that reason alone, dwindling manufacturing
employment is a concern."

Gorte referred to several OTA studies which identified possible
policy options to reduce the impact of foreign competitiveness
on U.S. industry.  But she said "An issue [currently] facing many
smaller manufacturers in particular is lack of access to bank
financing; even though the recession is officially over, many
(especially smaller enterprises) are having a tough time getting
loans.  This situation developed after OTA's work on
competitiveness was delivered, so our reports suggest no options
to remedy it; however, the issue needs addressing."

TECHNOLOGY MOVES TOO FAST FOR SMALL
COMPANIES

Commenting on possible measures to increase technology
diffusion, Gorte said the pace of technological change was "often
faster than enterprise managers can cope with" at small- and
medium-sized companies who also have trouble "learning about
and understanding new production machinery and techniques, or
soft production technologies such as continuous improvement
and statistical process controls."

She observed that Japan and Germany both have "well-
developed networks to inform small manufacturers of what
technological improvements (both hard and soft) they could
make," and noted that extensive public subsidies for loans to
enable small enterprises to adopt new technologies existed in
Japan, Korea and several other nations.

In the United States, Gorte characterized such systems of
technological extension and information service as "much more
rudimentary, particularly at the federal level."  Although a few
states have well-developed manufacturing extension services,
they are "typically much smaller than the potential demand for
their services," Gorte noted.  Learning from and expanding on
the most promising of the new technology extension efforts,
including parts of the recently authorized Technology
Reinvestment Program, over the next several years was
recommended.

Gorte singled out as an example of a small yet meritorious
public cost-sharing program in civilian technology development,
the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  "In the few years
of its operation [ATP] has gained a reputation for sensible
management and promising investment," Gorte said.  "Early
evaluations show that it continues to look promising."

BRIEFS

The Commerce Department this week will announce the winner
or winners of the 1993 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
Award.  This year, 76 companies applied for the award, which
recognizes overall quality strategy and management.  That field
was narrowed to 13 in August and teams from the award's board
of examiners visited the companies in September.  The finalists
included  four manufacturers, five service companies and four
small businesses.  The Baldrige award has been given since 1988.
Last year's winners included AT&T Network Systems
Group/Transmission Systems Business Unit, Texas Instruments
Inc. Defense Systems & Electronics Group, AT&T Universal
Card Services, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel co. and Granite Rock Co.

The Department of Energy's Office of Defense Programs has
approved its first technology transfer projects for Fiscal Year
1994.  The awards, totalling $8.4 million, will be funded through
DOE's national laboratories.  The projects approved range in
scope from electron beam processing of manufacturing waste to
intelligent control systems for combustion engines, according to
a DOE official.  The Y-12 facility operated by Martin Marietta
received $900,000 for one project; Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory received $900,000 for three projects; Los Alamos
National Laboratory received $1.4 million for three projects and
Sandia National Laboratory received $5.2 million to fund nine
projects.

The Clinton administration has agreed to establish a defense
conversion clearinghouse in the Commerce Department.  The
proposal was introduced by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) as an
amendment to the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Department
Authorization bill (ITP, Sept. 20, p.18).  The Office of Economic
Conversion Information would provide information on federal,
state and local defense conversion programs for companies,
workers and localities hurt by military downsizing and base
closures.

The Superconducting Super Collider's (SSC) fate may be
determined when the House considers this week the $22 billion
Fiscal Year 1994 spending bill for energy and water projects.
House opponents were furious last week when House and
Senate conferees agreed to include $640 million in funds for the
SSC in the bill despite the House having voted to kill the project
by a vote of 280-150 in June.  The Senate had voted 57-42 to
continue the project.  So far, the federal government has spent
$1.6 billion in the SSC, which will cost an estimated $11 billion
to complete.  Opponents have charged that in tight fiscal times,
the money could be either saved or better spent on more
practical technology endeavors.
