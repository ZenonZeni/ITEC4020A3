                           MOTION FOR REMAND  


     The Drug Enforcement Administration, respondent in the above-

captioned appeal, hereby moves this Court to remand the action to the 

Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.  In support of 

this motion and as the basis therefore, respondent states as follows:  

     1.   On September 6, 1992, appellant Olsen filed a petition with 

the Administrator requesting that marijuana be rescheduled from 

Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.  In 

support of this petition, appellant filed a statement of grounds for 

rescheduling in compliance with 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.44(b)(B).  

     2.   On October 23, 1992, the Administrator responded to 

appellant's petition by refusing to accept that petition for filing. 

Prior to rejecting the petition for filing the Administrator took no 

action to review the grounds upon which appellant relied in that 

petition.  

     3.   Pursuant to the 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.44(c), respondent is 

required to accept the petition for filing absent some defect in 

format.  As this requirement was not met, respondent now requests this 

Court to remand the matter so that respondent may accept appellant's 

petition for filing and review that petition in accordance with 

regulations.  See NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  

     4.   Respondent makes this motion in the interests of fairness 

and judicial economy and not with the intent of causing unnecessary 

delay.  Therefore, respondent respectfully requests this Court to 

order the Administrator upon remand to accept appellant's petition for 

filing and to make a ruling upon the matter within 90 days of the date 

of this Court's final order in the related cases of Alliance for 

Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1168 

and Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-

1179.  Both of these cases are scheduled for oral argument on October 

1, 1993.

     Respectfully submitted,  

     Lena D. Mitchell  
     Trial Attorney  
     Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section  
     U.S. Department of Justice
     Criminal Division
