<B>Photoelectrochemical Production of Hydrogen;<br>
Richard Rocheleau, Principal Investigator,<br>

Hawaii</B></a>

<P>
The University of Hawaii's integrated research program 
involves electrode fabrication, characterization, and engineering 
modeling; the objective of this work is to develop a high-efficiency, 
low-cost photoelectrochemical system for the direct production of 
hydrogen.
<P>
Progress in developing an efficient system for direct photoelectrolytic 
production of 
hydrogen from water has been limited by the high voltage required to 
dissociate water and the 
corrosiveness of the aqueous electrolytes.  Loss analysis and reactor 
models indicate that high direct photoelectrolysis efficiencies (solar to 

hydrogen) can be obtained by using multijunction solid-state devices with 

appropriate catalytic surfaces.  These designs provide greater 
flexibility in the photoelectrode design and offer a wider choice of 
materials for protection and catalytic activation of the interface. 
<P>
The focus of future work will be to continue collaborations with 
industrial partners to 
demonstrate stable performance using electrodes that are larger in area 
than the ones previously investigated.
<P>
<b><I>Recent Advances:</I></b>
<P>Additional outdoor testing of PEC cells was performed to confirm

the hydrogen production efficiency of 7.5% and to characterize

PEC performance under a broader range of conditions.  A different

triple-junction cell from the same batch was used to fabricate

a new set of photoelectrodes for these new tests.  Experiments

were conducted on a clear day with minimal cloud interference.

<P>

The hydrogen production efficiency was 7.8% during the initial

part of the experiment, decreasing very slowly to around 7.7%

for the first 90 minutes of the experiment and to approximately

7.6% by the end of the two-hour test.  Since the oxygen and hydrogen

catalysts have been shown repeatedly to be very stable for more

than 140 hours, we speculated that the decrease in the efficiency

was due to spectral sensitivity of the triple-junction solar cell.

 The solar spectrum in the evening is considerably different than

that in the afternoon.  In the evening, the solar radiation, coming

at an angle, travels a greater distance in the Earth's atmosphere.

 This results in increased scattering of UV and blue rays.  Hence,

the evening solar spectra are less rich in UV and blue radiation,

which lends the yellow and red colors to sunsets.  Because the

top layer of a triple-junction cell is normally optimized for the

absorption of blue light, one would expect the triple-junction

solar cell to be sensitive to the evening solar spectrum.  Additional

tests were designed to confirm this.
