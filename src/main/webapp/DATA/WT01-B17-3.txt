No one can deny that cancer is epidemic. Yet medical journals abound with

prestigious research demonstrating the value of nutrient supplementation in its

prevention and treatment. Why, then, is our Food and Drug Administration (FDA),

led by commissioner David Kessler, waging a relentless campaign to eliminate

alternatives that include supplementation?  Why is the emphasis so strongly tied

to drug therapy? And why is the sick and tired American public getting sick and

tired of not being told the truth? 



<P><CENTER>"THE EXISTENCE OF DIETARY 

<BR>SUPPLEMENTS SHOULD NOT ACT 

<BR> AS A DIS-INCENTIVE FOR DRUG 

<BR> DEVELOPMENT."</CENTER> 



<P> A new law, the Nutritional Labeling and Education Act (NLEA),

scheduled to go into effect in July 1994, will severely limit the public's

ability to buy vitamins and minerals. This will be accomplished by permitting

the FDA to reclassify hundreds of dietary supplements as "illegal drugs." 



<P>The

rationale? The labels of these supplements suggest that they may have possible

health benefits. Totally ignored is the fact that many of them do indeed have

health benefits and that endless studies reported by our own physicians validate

these very benefits! 



<P>So why does the FDA want to restrict their use? 

Jonathan Wright, M.D., has offered information that helps shed light on the

answer to that question. Dr. Wright, a prominent physician with more than twenty

years of experience in family practice and one of the world's experts in

nutritional biochemistry, is an outspoken critic of FDA policy. (You are probably

already familiar with the widely-publicized incident involving the gestapolike

FDA raid on Dr. Wright's office that took place on the morning of May 6, 1992.)



<P>Dr. Wright has compiled statements from congressmen, FDA officials, and

judges that paint a compelling picture of the "hidden" agenda of the FDA in its

proclaimed role as guardians of our nation's health. Read them and see what you

think.

what is happening [with dietary supplements] in the legislative arena ... If

these efforts are successful, there could be a class of products to compete with

approved drugs that are subject to less regulation than approved drugs ... the

establishment of a separate regulatory category for supplements could undercut

exclusivity rights enjoyed by holders of approved drug applications."

Over the years, I have periodically gone to the public library to

research the backgrounds of top FDA executives and those of large companies in

the food and drug business. The "revolving door" pattern is obvious. Congress

itself revealed in 1969 that 37 of 49 top officials of the FDA who left the

agency moved into high corporate positions with the large companies they had

regulated.

vitamin, mineral, and supplement business. In the past two years, more than 30

health food stores, doctors' offices, and supplement manufacturers have been

raided by the FDA and state agents."

<P>

There's more, much more. These nine excerpts, however, should give you a clear

picture of why the FDA does what it does. What do you think?



<P>

With new regulations, no information relating correlations between nutrients and

diseases can appear on the labels of supplements - relationships between fiber

deficiency and colon cancer, lack of chromium and diabetes, vitamin E deficiency

and heart disease, vitamin C and tissue integrity, vitamin D and bone health, guar

gum and blood sugar metabolism, etc.



<P>

<CENTER>"92 PERCENT OF 109 DRUG

<BR>COMPANY ADVERTISEMENTS

<BR>VIOLATED FDA REGULATIONS."</CENTER>



<P>

Here's one more excerpt for you to think about: The February 1994 issue of Health

Freedom News, a natural health magazine that claims it "dares to tell the truth,"

advises that "The FDA has been lying to the public since it has been given the

power to regulate supplement labels for decades and it has failed to do so. To

complain that it needs more power, when it has not used the power it already has,

is hard to understand. If the FDA had been taking care of business, the

L-tryptophan problem would never have happened. A label could not help the people

who died from a bad batch of Tylenol. However, unlike L-tryptophan, Tylenol is

still on the market."



<P><B>Editor's note: </B>

<I>A tainted batch of L-tryptophan, traced to a single manufacturer, caused the FDA

to withdraw this product from ALL sources.  Physicians had been prescribing

L-tryptophan successfully for more than 20 years.  No one except the drug-oriented

FDA wanted to replace this safe relaxant with harmful drugs.  Physicians

protested, but to no avail.</I>



<P>

<CENTER>"THE LABEL CANNOT REVEAL THAT

<BR>NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES AND

<BR>DISEASES MAY BE RELATED.</CENTER>



<P>

T.K. Vodrey, the publisher of Let's Live magazine, urges everyone to help get

Congress to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994. "The

best way to insure this passage," says Vodrey, "is more letters, faxes and phone

calls to your representatives in Washington.  Ask them to co-sponsor S. 784 and

H.R. 1709 if they haven't already.  We all need to keep the pressure up so there

will be a positive chance of having this act passed into law."



<P>

Finally, Vodrey shares our view by thanking everyone for the support of the

natural health industry.
