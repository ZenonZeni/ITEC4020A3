WINGS WEST TOPS AMERICAN EAGLE CARRIERS IN MOST PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES

   California-based American Eagle carrier Wings West held a slim
performance margin over other wholly owned American Eagle carriers in the
three-month period ended Sept. 30. According to DOT data, Wings West
recorded a completion factor of 95%, compared to 94% for Simmons and 91%
each for Command and Nashville Eagle. Load-factor was 57% compared to 56%
for Nashville Eagle, 52% for Simmons and 49% for Command. Simmons topped
the others in terms of traffic with 86.3 million revenue passenger miles.
That compared to 35.1 million for Nashville Eagle, 34 million for Wings
West and 26.7 million for Command.

NEW TRANSPORTATION "STRATEGY" LIKELY TO INCLUDE HIGHER USER FEES

   Increased aviation user taxes at state and local as well as federal
levels will be part of the foundation for a new national transportation
"strategy" being formulated by the Bush Administration. The strategy,
which also would allow increased access to U.S. markets by foreign
carriers, is to be released next month after the state of the union speech
and publication of the President's fiscal 1991 budget. In a speech to the
Transportation Research Board in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, Skinner said
the cost of shaping up the nation's transportation infrastructure over the
next 20 years could run from one to three trillion dollars and called for a
"stonger, healthier partnership among federal, state and local
governments."
   Such a partnership would be strengthened, Skinner added, by replacing
"rigid requirements with performance-related criteria in federal
transportation programs," including "additional regulatory flexibility and
policies that recognize the diversity of conditions and needs in the real
world." Such a healthier partnership "goes hand-in-hand with reduced
dependence on federal money. We believe federal recipients of federal
transportation aid should pay a larger share of project costs." Skinner
said that increasing the ante for state and local governments will "help
bring the principles of market competition to bear in our financing
programs" and "also strengthen state and local accountability for wise
transportation decisions." He said the government would be seeking new and
creative ways to "apply the time-tested user-fee principle."
   Directly from the users, Skinner said the government would seek to
recover "the maximum practical share of costs they impose. This includes
recovering federal costs from user groups that are now getting a free ride.
We also want to make it easier for other levels of government to levy user
fees for transportation improvements." Such moves would allow local
airport authorities to impose passenger facility charges (PFCs), or head
taxes, which is prohibited under current airport and airway funding
legislation. Hike from 8% to at least 10% is anticipated for the airline
passenger ticket tax as well as a four-cent increase in the levy on non-
commercial aviation fuel.

AOPA WOULD DUMP GROUND-BASED ATC SYSTEM IN FAVOR OF SATELLITES

   FAA should abandon its reliance on a ground-based air traffic control
system in favor of a satellite-based system using the growing Global
Positioning Satellites (GPS) network, AOPA President John Baker urged this
week. In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Baker
charged that the National Airspace System Plan, the government's multi-
billion-dollar attempt to upgrade the National Airspace System, is behind
schedule and over budget. The charge drew an immediate response from DOT
Secretary Samuel Skinner, who called the U.S. ATC system "the safest in the
world." Conceding capacity problems due to demand exceeding supply,
Skinner added, "all you have to do isgo to Europe to find out what I am
talking about." Propelling 1950s technology into 1990 technology is
"time-consuming; it is state-of-the-art; it is expensive; and, it is
difficult...but I can assure you, that technology is right on target," he
declared.
   Baker said from original cost estimates of $11.4 billion in 1981, FAA is
now looking at a total cost of $25 billion to $27 billion to complete the
NAS improvements and is 10 years behind the original implementation
schedule. He called for a congressional investigation of the NAS Plan
effort, adding that "it doesn't make sense to move forward in that
direction (completing the current NAS Plan). We believe it's now time to
recast this program and move to the system of the future."
   Baker said a major portion of the GPS system, which was designed to
provide navigation and communication capabilities for use by the military,
is already in place, noting that 14 of the satellites in the 24-satellite
network are already in orbit and "are working phenomenally well." He said
that satellite network can provide guidance accurate enough for non-
precision and Category I approaches at a much lower cost than continuing
with all the elements of the current NAS Plan. An AOPA report found the 90
separate projects envisioned in the NAS Plan have now grown to 187 separate
projects. The report states that projects with an estimated cost of $7.14
billion to $10.8 billion could be eliminated or sharply reduced because
they will not be needed to implement or support a satellite-based control
system. Among the potential savings listed by AOPA are: $345 million for
control tower/TRACON modernization; $426 million for Air Route Traffic
Control Center modernization; $196 million in facilities and equipment
expenditures for the new Denver, Colo., airport and $111 million of planned
improvements in ATC system facilities and equipment in the area around
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport to support actual and forecast traffic growth;
$1.1 billion to implement the microwave landing system;over $1 billion for
terminal radar digitizing, replacement and establishment; $108 million to
sustain and relocate Automatic Surveillance Radar, and over $740 million
earmarked for long-range radar replacement and networking.

STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF FAIRCHILD AIRCRAFT CONTINUES

   Dispute over control of Fairchild Aircraft Corp. appeared to have been
settled out of court late Thursday, although the outcome was unclear at RAW
presstime. No principals in the dispute were available for comment.
According to RAW sources, however, company president William Cavanaugh and
VP Gene Morgan have regained access to the company's San Antonio plant. The
two officers were blocked from the premises by a Dec. 29 temporary
restraining order (TRO) obtained by attorneys representing new owner Carl
Albert, former chairman of American Eagle Wings West and a major Fairchild
customer (RAW, Dec. 22/461. There was to have been a court hearing on the
TRO in San Antonio Thursday morning, but parties for neither side showed
up. RAW has been unable to verify that Albert signed a contract with
certain members of the Fairchild board of directors to acquire the
outstanding note against the company held by the Sanwa Bank of Japan. The
note had financed the acquisition of the company from Fairchild Industries
by GMF Financial of Los Angeles in late 1987. Albert immediately sought
the TRO to prevent Cavanaugh and Morgan from causing "severe disruption to
the business operation" of Fairchild by "exercising powers previously held
as president and VP," according to court documents. Sources also indicate
that agreement has been reached between Albert, on the one hand, and
Cavanaugh and Morgan on the other, that would allow Albert's control of the
commany to proceed.

TWEXPRESS POCONO SHUTS DOWN; RETURN TO SERVICE SEEN UNLIKELY

   Financially troubled Pocono Airways, failing to recover from Chapter 11
bankruptcy since last March, has ceased operations. The TWExpress carrier
will not attempt toresume service. Carrier had been using eight of its own
commuter slots at New York Kennedy in addition to 11 air carrier slots
leased from TWA. The commuter slots will by acquired by TWA under
provisions of a bankruptcy reorganization plan approved last winter and
will be assigned to TWExpress carriers Metro Northeast and Jet Express. TWA
also is expected to assign its 11 jet slots to its remaining regional
partners, at least temporarily.
   Pocono, a unit of Dallas-based Phoenix Ventures, a corporate successor
to Air Florida, lost $3.5 million last year and President Dann Lewis said
the parent company had already loaned the carrier $5.5 million to offset
losses and to meet other requirements. "Unfortunately, after an evaluation
of operating performance and projections, it did not make a lot of sense to
keep the airline going," he added. The Avoca, Pa.-based carrier served 11
airports in five states, operating with nine leased Metro III aircraft on
90 scheduled daily flights. Destinations, In addition to New York Kennedy,
were Albany and Binghamton, N.Y.; Boston; Harrisburg, Philadelphia and
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pa.; Providence, R.I.; Washington's Dulles and
National airports, and Norfolk, Va. Approximately 200 jobs were affected.
   Pocono filed for Chapter 11 protection and initially ceased operations
in mid-1988 when it lost its long-standing Allegheny Commuter relationship
with USAir. Reorganization hit a snag when its major creditor,
Northwestern Bank of Pennsylvania, feared that the proposed agreement with
TWA would give the larger carrier a unilateral right to buy the eight
Kennedy slots at any time. Under the final agreement TWA was given the
right to acquire the slots - Pocono's primary assets - only in case of
breach of contract and "in such a way as to give rise to a right of
termination by TWA."
   Lewis said the carrier's primary problem was its "very poor restrictive
agreement with TWA." He said the senior partner had approved overlapping
markets for former Brockway Air Metro Northeast, a unit of Dallas-based
Metro Airlines and the the primary beneficiary of the Pocono shutdown.
Metro is bringing in two additional Saab 340s, in addition to its existing
10, and also expects to increase its fleet of 11 Beech 1900s to 13. Metro
leases four TWA air carrier slots at Kennedy and expects to gain most of
those forfeited by Pocono.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN CHAUTAUQUA METRO III DESTRUCTION

   Fire destroyed a Chautauqua Airlines Fairchild Metro III early last
Thursday at Washington County Regional Airport, Hagerstown, Md. Local fire
inspectors suspect arson, according to carrier President Joel Hall.
Aircraft had arrived at about 10:30 p.m. from Pittsburgh the previous
evening for a scheduled eight-hour layover. The fire, which apparently was
set just inside the passenger door, was reported at 2:38 a.m. Value of the
19-passenger aircraft was placed at $2.3 million. Hall said there were no
known outside influences that possibly could have prompted the act. There
were no immediate suspects or motives.

AIR WISCONSIN TO RECEIVE FIRST BAE ATP NEXT WEEK

   United Express Air Wisconsin next week is expected to receive its first
64-passenger British Aerospace Advanced Turboprop (ATP), marking its
adoption of a higher-capacity strategy at its Chicago O'Hare and Washington
Dulles hubs. As the new ATPs arrive at Chicago, they will free up existing
50-passenger F27s for service at the Dulles hub, where they will replace
five remaining 36-passenger Shorts 360s. The first ATP is to begin service
at Chicago March 1 and the second March 15. The first F27 will begin
Dulles service March 15. Although Air Wisconsin's strategy was dictated by
a lack of additional slots at O'Hare, where American's acquisition of all
Continental Express Britt Airways slots had placed Air Wisconsin at a
disadvantage, the demise of United Express Presidential had added impetus
to development of the Dulles hub.
   Air Wisconsin was not equipped to step into most of the former
Presidential routes on a timely basis. California-based United Express
Westair Holdings was so equipped...and did. Although so far limiting its
activities to Part 135 operations with aircraft seating 30 or fewer
passengers, WestAir has left the door open to larger aircraft. Air
Wisconsin is expected to move decisively into those Dulles markets that can
support F27 aircraft as quickly as possible, although specific markets have
not been revealed.

METRO NORTHEAST TO ENTER WHITE PLAINS O&D MARKETS

   TWExpress Metro Northeast next month will jump into two lucrative White
Plains origin-and-destination markets traditionally prized by American
Eagle Command - Boston and Washington National. Command has dropped the
Washington market completely and has scaled back capacity in the Boston
market in favor of feeding American's developing New York Kennedy hub.
Metro will begin with seven daily roundtrips in the Boston market Feb. 1,
increasing to nine trips Feb. 15. Carrier President Doug Caldwell said
Metro acquired 22 White Plains slots from Command and that it hoped to
become dominant in the White Plains market.
   Carrier will initially operate two Washington National roundtrips, three
to Buffalo over Syracuse and two to Rochester. Primary aircraft in the new
service will be Saab 340s, of which Metro Northeast will shortly have 12.
Together with 13 Beech 1900s, the carrier will be offering 27 daily
departures at White Plains - well short of 52 Albany departures and 35
from second-place Binghamton. But Metro's role in the White Plains market
is considered significant in its strategy of growth. And, asserted
Caldwell, "We will try to maintain our dominance." USAir Express Henson
currently dominates the White Plains-Washington National market and Command
remains the primary carrier between White Plains and Boston with eight
weekday frequencies, followed by Delta Connection Business Express with
four.

STATESWEST TRIMS ANNUAL LOSS BY 37 PERCENT

   StatesWest Airlines reported a net loss of $2.7 million for the fiscal
year ended Sept. 30, a 37% reduction from the previous year's net loss of
$4.3 million. According to President Rudy Miller, the Phoenix-based
independent regional has made "significant strides" during the past year,
adding $6 million to its working capital through an exercise of its Series
B warrants. In addition, Miller said the carrier during the year
implemented cost-reduction measures, restructured its fleet by switching
from BAe Jetstream 31s to Beech 1900s, and increased fares in the second
half. Miller also said the carrier entered into or renewed joint-fare
agreements with nine major airlines, which increased load factors and
yields per revenue passenger mile, and originated service in several new
markets.
   Operating revenues during the fiscal year declined 6% to just under $5.6
million. Operating expenses were down 24.4% to $7.5 million, but non-
operating expenses were up 144.2% to $793,800. Traffic also dipped, but
load factor increased from 34.7% to 43.3%. Passenger boardings were down
2.5% to 104,057; available seat miles decreased 21% to 49.2 million; RPMs
declined slightly, to 21.3 million from 21.7 million. Unit costs stood at
15.2 cents per ASM compared with 15.9 cents in 1988. Miller said
Stateswest is "positioned to continue the favorable trend it established in
fiscal 1989 and plans to add its fifth and sixth (Beech 1900s) in the
spring." The company "is in a strong capital position at present and will
continue to explore expansion through acquisition or joint venture."

MESA TALKS WITH UNITED ARE PROGRESSING; FLEET PLANS REVEALED

   Talks are "progressing" between Mesa Airlines and United on Mesa's
assuming United Express status at the Denver hub. Acquisition by the
Farmington, N.M., regional of nearly all Aspen Airways routes and stations
in the Rocky Mountain area is contingent upon its gaining the United
affiliation (RAW, Dec. 29/470). Aspen owner Don Ringsby agreed to break up
his long-time regional carrier when he was unable to sell it as one unit;
California investor Burt Sugarman dropped his offer in October after the
management/employee/British Airways acquisition of United fell through.
Ringsby plans to sell his 10 Convair 580s and jet operation, including
leases on four BAe 146-100s and an exclusive United Express route between
Denver and Aspen, as separate units.
   Mesa founder and President Larry Risley said he sees no resistance to
the new relationship on the part of United and no reason the transition
cannot begin in early February rather than March 1, as originally stated.
By taking only the routes and stations, Risley is able to replace Aspen's
aging fleet of 10 Convair 580s, of which seven fly the schedules while
three are in reserve or maintenance, with a new fleet of 19- and 30-
passenger airplanes. He plans a $50 million investment that will include
11 Beech 1900s and four 30-passenger airplanes - either the Embraer
Brasilia or the Saab 340B with a 30-passenger configuration.
   Risley, who also is chairman of the Regional Airline Association, said
he has no intention of taking the United Express operation up to Part 121
status, under which aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats are
permitted, in the immediate future. Over the long term, however, he said
he is looking at the new 30-passenger-plus Dornier 328. To reach his
requirement for 11 1900s by June 1, when he hopes to complete the
transition, Risley will retain five older 1900Bs that were going to be
traded in on five new 1900Cs, the first of which has already been
delivered. Delivery of four new Brasilias or Saabs by June 1 is more
uncertain, and Risley said he may have to operate some used aircraft in the
interim.
   Contrary to an earlier report, Risley is not seeking to place his
existing Mesa Airlines structure under the United Express umbrella. The
New Mexico and Arizona operation, which feeds the Albuquerque and Phoenix
hubs, will remain an independent unit. Only those flights feeding United
at Denver will carry the United Express livery. "We have no plan to change
the existing Mesa structure." Nor, he added, is he interested in the
seasonal Denver-Aspen ski market, which will be retained, at least for the
time being, by Aspen owner Ringsby.
   There will be little difference between the management and support
structures of Mesa and United Express, however. Flight crews will be
cross-utilized by both systems and all United Express aircraft will flow
through the Mesa maintenance base at Farmington, which along with Colorado
Springs and Durango, Colo., are the three jointly served points. Mesa
hopes to hire up to 50 Aspen Convair pilots to help fill a requirement for
90 additional pilots to operate the new system. Beech 1900 pay, however,
will be half that of Convair pay, which is consistent with Aspen's current
Air Line Pilots Association contract for 19-passenger airplanes.
   Ringsby has said there are several prospective buyers for the Aspen jet
operation, one of which is believed to be WestAir Holdings, the Fresno,
Calif.-based United Express carrier thought to have been interested in the
entire Aspen operation. WestAir has expanded to the East Coast, however,
joining Air Wisconsin in feeding United's Washington Dulles hub (RAW, Dec.
15/455).

DISCOVERY, OPPONENTS GET EXTRA ROUNDS FOR SQUABBLE OVER NEW HAWAII SERVICE

   Opponents of Discovery Airways' planned intra-Hawaii service have made
the most of the extra rounds they have been given by DOT to attempt to
prevent the new entrant's operations, firing away at Discovery over
citizenship issues. Meanwhile, Discovery, hoping to begin service Feb. 1,
has taken delivery of its first BAe 146 aircraft and is responding to its
opponents. It claims Hawaiian and Aloha, in a kind of pre-emptive
strike, have been attempting to capture the market in advance of
Discovery's entry. The incumbents have dropped fares 22% for passengers
who purchase coupons by Jan. 15. DOT has proposed to find Discovery fit,
subject to several conditions (RAW, Dec. 29/474).
   In filings at DOT, Aloha, Hawaiian, Air Line Pilots Association and the
Machinists union said a hearing in the Discovery Airways proceeding that is
concerned solely with the issue of potential control of Discovery by Philip
Ho is far too limited. Other citizenship issues should be addressed, they
said, including Nansay Corporation's (a Japanese company) potential control
separate from Ho; the role of Franco Mancassola, an Italian citizen, and
the terms of the agreements between Discovery and British Aerospace, the
carrier's sole equipment supplier. Aloha contended DOT's show cause order
proposing to grant Discovery a certificate before resolving all citizenship
issues is "contrary to more than five decades of precedent."
    Hawaiian told DOT it recognized and shared the department's reluctance
to impede the free flow of capital across international boundaries, or
financing which is a straightforward loan transaction not providing for
foreign control. "However, it is abundantly clear that the
Nansay/Discovery relationship involves far more than a straightforward loan
transaction," Hawaiian said.
   ALPA said Ho's fiduciary obligations to Nansay Hawaii give Nansay
impermissible control over Discovery. Given that Ho's personal investment
in Discovery "is dwarfed by his employer's massive investment of up to $12
million, there can be little doubt that he will vote his stock to protect
Nansay's interests in the applicant." The Machinists union filed similar
comments.
   Discovery said none of the objectors had given valid reasons for further
delaying its application. Assertion of the opponents that DOT's order
proposing the fitness finding constitutes a radical departure from the
agency's long-held position on foreign control "is wholly unfounded,"
Discovery said. "In fact, the tight restrictions embodied in the order
will surely discourage even the most passive foreign invesment in domestic
air carriers." Discovery urged DOT immediately to grant oral authority to
advertise and promptly issue a final order so that operations may begin
Feb. 1 as scheduled "on a sound financial basis."

OREGON CONGRESSMAN SAYS MLS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IS NECESSARY

   An Oregon congressman said the microwave landing system (MLS)
demonstration program is needed to determine how best to operate aircraft
in the future and that FAA erred in making a major policy announcement on
the system before an FAA/industry task force completes work on the program.
Rep. Denny Smith (R), in a letter to FAA Administrator James Busey, said
"making such a major policy pronouncement before the agency/industry task
force completes its work can only serve to send the wrong signal to the
participants." Describing a detailed ILS/MLS transition plan is "at best
premature and at worst calls into question the commitment of the FAA to
perform a thorough and impartial analysis of our traffic management
options," Smith said. For the demonstration to be effective, the
participants must be an "integral part" of the analysis, he said. "Finding
the best approach to manage our airspace in the next century will require
the contributions of many different players. We cannot circumvent this
process by trying to choose the answer before we have all the results at
our disposal."

AIR WISCONSIN, ATTENDANTS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON NEW CONTRACT

   Negotiators representing Air Wisconsin's 150 flight attendants and the
carrier Friday reached a tentative agreement on an amended contract,
following over seven months of negotiations. Air Wisconsin's attendants
are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants. Terms of the
agreement were not disclosed pending ratification by the rank and file.
Members will vote by confidential mail ballots to be counted Jan. 30. The
two sides, deadlocked, had jointly filed for federal mediation on Oct. 12,
1989, and during the last three days of negotiations were assisted by a
federal mediator. The previous contract had become subject to amendment on
June 30, 1989, with negotiations beginning May 31, 1989.

Semantics appear to play a major role in the Bush Administration's espoused
switch from a National Transportation "Policy" to National Transportation
"Strategy." Major difference is that policies tend to be written in
concrete, while strategies can easily be changed. On the other hand, the
administration may need quick footwork to punch across increased aviation
user fees at the same time it is protecting an unobligated aviation
trust-fund surplus of more than $6.5 billion (see related story on page 10
of hardcopy of this issue).

National Aviation Policy will not be detailed until after the new National
Transportation Strategy makes the rounds of Capitol Hill, which will not
happen until well into February following publication of the fiscal 1991
budget. Aviation policy will be FAA's implementation of its interpretation
of the transportation policy, including increasing the airline passenger
ticket tax and non-commercial aviation fuel tax, and permitting airports to
assess head taxes in the form of passenger facility charges (PFCs).

Sale of Fairchild Aircraft to Los Angeles attorney and former Wings West
Chairman Carl Albert - should it occur - is premised on Albert capturing a
major order from American Eagle for replacement Metro IIIs. In the
alternative, parts production alone for the existing Metro fleet is said to
be sufficient to keep the factory doors open. Possible sale of the parts
distribution function was one of the sparks resulting in the ouster of
former President Tom Smith and his management team in 1988.
