<i>
Quality health care has never been more important. We have a national health service that is excellent in many ways, particularly for emergencies and General Practitioner service.  For many conditions, however, waiting lists are long and the resources available stretched. Under these circumstances the advantages of private medical treatment become increasingly attractive. Unfortunately, premiums charged for private medical insurance are becoming ever more expensive.
<p>
At </i>MEDICUS <i>we want to ensure that our clients can receive the medical care they need at the time of their choice. We believe it to be of paramount importance that premium levels are affordable and our clients have the freedom to choose the level of benefits that suits both their needs and their budget.
<p>
We have therefore developed a range of Health Care Plans offering cover ranging from basic to extensive and fully comprehensive international protection, all at competitive premium levels. We have achieved this by the introduction of innovative concepts designed to bring the cost of private health care down to an affordable level.<html>
