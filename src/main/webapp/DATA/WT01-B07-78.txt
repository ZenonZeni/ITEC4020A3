Abstract: Various methods of improving the energy efficiency of
foundations, walls and roofs are examined, including wall assemblies
that can reduce conductive heat loss (from 25% to 65%), air leakage,
thermal bridging and sound transmission. The advantages of a narrow-fronted
terrace house with relatively small exposed wall area are outlined.

Abstract: Describes the energy problems which can be introduced
to a house as a result of its being extended and ways to add on
to a house economically while adding as little as possible to
the energy bills. Many of the techniques described also apply
when retrofitting a house that has been remodelled.

<H2>#NO 9425 Demonstration of full height basement insulation
construction methods.</H2>

Buchan, Lawton, Parent Ltd

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, June 1992, 55pp. The
project consisted of design development, construction, and follow-up
testing and inspection of ten typical single-family house basements
in Southern Ontario. One non-typical house was also investigated.
A range of builders participated in the project constructing houses
and commenting on their experiences. This is a final report consisting
of results from the construction phase and the soak test phase.
Of the schemes tested, six were insulated from the exterior, four
from the interior, and the additional house had an insulating
block wall scheme. General findings from the construction phase
were that interior insulation schemes were favoured over exterior
ones, but that both systems have different detailing problems
for which training is required to resolve. Rigid glass fibre insulation
was found to be easier to apply to exterior walls with commonly-found
irregularities than were rigid polystyrene materials. Panelized
above-grade insulation protection products offer some advantages
over site applied ones, but they tend to be difficult to adapt
for residential use. Composite geotextiles wall drainage panels
and ledge blocks require further development to improve their
applicability to residential construction. Other basement design
configurations (ie. modifications to the methods tried) may solve
some of the problems encountered by builders in this project.
The soak testing indicated that for the basement systems demonstrated
and the soil conditions at these sites, the moisture handling
methods were generally successful in limiting leakage problems.
Soil conditions on the test sites provided fair to good drainage.
Care must be taken to avoid gaps with the drainage of insulation
materials and finish detailing where moisture ingress can be concentrated.
It is evident that builders and trades persons require more technical
information and experience on the use of materials where moisture
handling is important.

Abstract: Glazed facades may cause thermal discomfort due to downdraft.
Convectors placed close to the facade can prevent downdraft but
can cause an increase in the energy consumption. The objective
of this research was to investigate whether the structural system
of a glazed facade can be used to reduce downdraft and avoid thermal
comfort problems in the occupied zone. The effect of large obstacles
on a cold boundary layer flow was investigated for different temperature
differences between the obstacles, and different sizes of the
obstacles. The effect of the obstacles was dependent on the characteristics
of the flow and the sizes of the obstacles. With turbulent flow
and an obstacle larger than the boundary layer thickness, the
flow separated from the surface and a new boundary layer was established
below the obstacle. The risk of thermal discomfort due to downdraft
was reduced considerably.

Abstract: A simplified ground heat loss calculation method for
slab-on-grade floors and basements is developed. The method is
based on the results from the ITPE method and is suitable for
seasonal heat loss calculation. The simplified method consists
of a set of equations for estimating the monthly total heat flow
between a building and the ground as a function of a wide range
of variables such as building dimensions, insulation configurations,
and soil thermal properties. The equations are designed to accept
continuously variable input values. The simplified method predictions
are tested against Mitalas's and ITPE results. The agreement between
the correlations and the ITPE method is found to be within 10%
for the annual mean, amplitude, and phase angle of total building
heat loss.

Abstract: The measured variation of heat losses across the floor
slab emphasize the potential benefits to be gained from the use
of edge insulation. In general, thermal transmittance values calculated
from the measured data are found to be in reasonable agreement
with values determined from design guides.

Abstract: Describes how field testing found that uncontrolled
air flows and building depressurisation are widespread in a sample
of eight Florida commercial buildings. These eight buildings experienced
substantial depressurisation under normal operation. In tight
buildings, only a small imbalance of air flow can produce serious
depressurisation problems. In very leaky buildings, large air
flow imbalances may produce only moderate depressurisation. The
problems caused by depressurisation in these buildings include
high humidity levels, mould and mildew growth on wall surfaces
and in building cavities, moisture damage to building materials,
extinguished pilot lights, combustion equipment backdrafting,
flame roll-out, sewer gas entering the building, and doors being
difficult to open.

Abstract: Designers are being encouraged towards passive cooling
and natural ventilation in buildings. This will promote heavyweight
buildings which utilise both fabric thermal storage and night
venting techniques.In terms of energy consumption and carbon dioxide
emissions, the new build sector is of relatively minor importance
compared with the existing stock of high energy consumption buildings,
many of which already contain air conditioning. This paper described
a new technique whereby new and existing buildings can be fitted
with a low energy air movement system, which significantly increases
the fabric thermal storage capacity of the building. This should
eliminate the need for air conditioning whilst still enabling
occupants to remain comfortable in summer.

Abstract: Describes the 'School Network' which consists of companies
in Norway making lighting, ventilating and window products all
of which are of prime importance for achieving low energy consumption,
comfortable thermal environment and good air quality. The network
as set up by the VEKST Foundation which for almost 20 years has
promoted the design and building of energy efficient buildings
with good indoor air quality. A school has since been designed
and built as a result.
