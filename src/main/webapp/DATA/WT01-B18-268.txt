<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Defendants were convicted in the Circuit Court, Bay County, 
Clinton Foster, J., of cultivating cannabis and possession of 
drug paraphernalia, and they appealed.&nbsp; The District Court of 
Appeal, Ervin, J., held that: (1) statute defining cannabis as 
Schedule I substance did not preclude defense of medical 
necessity, and (2) defendants established medical necessity 
defense. 
<P>
<DD>Reversed.

<DD>Nimmons, J., dissented.

<DD>Statute defining cannabis as Schedule I substance did not

charged with cultivating cannabis and possession of drug

2.&nbsp; Drugs and Narcotics 78 
<DD>Defendants charged with cultivating cannabis and possession of 
drug paraphernalia established medical necessity defense; medical 
expert and physician testified that no other drug or treatment 
was available that would effectively eliminate or diminish nausea 
suffered by defendants, who had contracted acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and defendants established that if 
their nausea was not controlled, their lives were in danger.&nbsp;

<P>
3.&nbsp; Drugs and Narcotics 78 
<DD>Elements of medical necessity defense to use of controlled 
substance are: that defendant did not intentionally bring about 
circumstances which precipitated unlawful act; that defendant 
could not accomplish same objective using less offensive 
alternative available to defendant; and that evil sought to be 
avoided was more heinous than unlawful act perpetrated to avoid 
it.

<P>
<DD>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING 
<P>
<DD>ERVIN, Judge. 
<P>
<DD>We substitute the following opinion for Jenks v. State, 16 
F.L.W. D1070, 1991 WL 61786 (Fla. 1st DCA Apr. 16, 1991). 
<P>
<DD>Kenneth and Barbara Jenks appeal their convictions for 
cultivation of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, 
contending that the trial court erred in refusing to recognize 
their defense of medical necessity.&nbsp; We agree and reverse. 
<P>
<DD>Kenneth Jenks inherited hemophilia from his mother, and 
contracted the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus 
from a blood transfusion in 1980.&nbsp; He unknowingly passed it to 
his wife, Barbara Jenks.&nbsp; Mrs. Jenks' health began to decline 
rapidly.&nbsp; Her weight dropped from 150 to 112 pounds during a 
three week period as a result of constant vomiting, and she was 
hospitalized at least six times for two to three weeks at a time.  
Although she had been prescribed over a half-dozen oral 
medications for nausea, none of them worked.&nbsp; When given shots for 
nausea, she was left in a stupor and unable to function.&nbsp; Like 
wise, when Mr. Jenks started AZT treatment, he was not able to 
eat because the medication left him constantly nauseous.&nbsp; He also 
lost weight, although not as dramatically as his wife. 
<P>
<DD>When the Jenks began participating in a support group 
sponsored by the Bay County Health Department, a group member 
told them how marijuana had helped him.&nbsp; Although initially 
reluctant, Mr. and Mrs. Jenks tried marijuana and found that they 
were able to retain their AIDS medications, eat, gain weight, 
maintain their health, and stay out of the hospital.&nbsp; They asked 
their treating physician about prescribing the drug, but were 
unable to obtain a legal prescription.&nbsp; The Jenks decided to grow 
two marijuana plants to insure its availability, avoid the 
expense of buying it on the street, and reduce the possibility of 
arrest. 
<P>
<DD>On March 29, 1990, the Jenks were arrested and charged with 
manufacturing (cultivating) cannabis, pursuant to Section 893.13, 
Florida Statutes (1989), and possession of drug paraphernalia, a 
violation of Section 893.147, Florida Statutes (1989).&nbsp; The Jenks 
admitted to cultivating the marijuana and advised officers at the 
scene that they each had AIDS and used the marijuana to relieve 
their symptoms. 
<P>
<DD>The Jenks waived their right to a jury trial and agreed that 
the bench trial should center on their defense of medical 
necessity.&nbsp; Because their physician, Thomas Sunnenberg, was not 
available to testify, the parties stipulated that Dr. 
Sunnenberg's testimony would be, in part: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Defense witness, THOMAS D. SUNNENBERG, M.D. ... will testify as follows: 
<P>
<DD>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 
<P>
<DD>8.&nbsp; That he has been unable to find any effective drug for treating the defendants' nausea. 
</BLOCKQUOTE></TT>
582 SOUTHERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES 678 
<TT><BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>9.&nbsp; That the nausea is so debilitating that if it is not controlled, the defendants could die. 
<P>
<DD>10.&nbsp; That if he could legally prescribe Cannabis Sativa as a drug to control their nausea he would. 
<P>
<DD>11.&nbsp; That the only drug that controls their nausea is Cannabis Sativa. 
<P>
<DD>12.&nbsp; That he is presently seeking access to legal Cannabis Sativa through the Food and Drug Administration under the Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program (IND) for the Jenks. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
At trial, the defense also presented two expert witnesses, Robert 
Randall, who suffers from glaucoma and who successfully asserted 
the defense of medical necessity against a charge of marijuana 
cultivation in 1976,* and Dr. Daniel Dansak of Alabama, who has 
treated over fifty patients who have used marijuana to alleviate 
both disease symptoms and side-effects of medication. 
<P>
<DD>The trial judge rejected the defense of medical necessity, 
found the Jenks guilty of manufacturing marijuana, and withheld 
adjudication of guilt, placing the Jenks on one year of 
unsupervised probation.  He ordered the Jenks to perform 500 
hours of community service, to be discharged only by "providing 
care, comfort and concern for each other." 
<P>
<DD>The necessity defense has been formulated as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The pressure of natural physical forces sometimes confronts a person in an emergency with a choice of two evils: either he may violate the literal terms of the criminal law and thus produce a harmful result, or he may comply with those terms and thus produce a greater or equal or lesser amount of harm.&nbsp; For reasons of social policy, if the harm which will result from compliance with the law is greater than that which will result from violation of it, he is by virtue of the defense of necessity justified in 
violating it.

W.R. LaFave &amp  A.W. Scott, Jr., 1 Substantive Criminal Law &sect; 
5.4, at 627 (1986) (hereinafter LaFave &amp; Scott).&nbsp; Or, as 
stated by Justice Holmes, "'Detached reflection cannot be 
expected in the presence of an uplifted knife.'"&nbsp; Arnolds &amp;  
Garland, The Defense of Necessity in Criminal Law: The Right to 
Choose the Lesser Evil, 65 J.Crim.L. &amp; Criminology 289, 290 
(1974) (hereinafter Arnolds &amp; Garland) (quoting Brown v. 
United States, 256 U.S. 335, 41 S.Ct. 501, 65 L.Ed. 961 (1921)). 
<P>
<DD>Although there is no specific legislative acceptance of the 
necessity defense in Florida, we conclude that the defense was 
recognized at common law and that there has been no clearly 
expressed legislative rejection of such defense.&nbsp; The necessity 
defense was articulated as early as 1551 in Reninger v. Fagossa, 
1 Plowd. 1, 19, 75 Eng.Rep. 1, 29-30 (1551): "[W]here the words 
of [the law] are broken to avoid greater inconvenience, or 
through necessity, or by compulsion," the law has not been 
broken.&nbsp;  Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 291.&nbsp; The authors state that 
the defense is poorly developed in Anglo-American jurisprudence 
because there are so few cases dealing with it, "probably because 
these cases are not often prosecuted."&nbsp; In any event, they 
indicate that although there is some disagreement on this, "it 
seems clear that necessity was a defense at common law."&nbsp; Arnolds 
&amp; Garland, at 290.&nbsp; The authors cite a number of pre-1776 
cases involving the necessity defense.&nbsp; Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 
291 n. 29.* 
<P>
<DD>Consequently, we consider that Florida has adopted the 
necessity defense pursuant to Section 2.01, Florida Statutes 
(1989), which provides: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The common and statute laws of England which are of a general and not a 
local nature ... are declared to be of force in this state; provided, the said statutes and common law be not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and the acts of the Legislature of this state. 
</BLOCKQUOTE></TT>
JENKS v. STATE Fla. 679 
<BR>Cite as 582 So.2d 676 (Fla.App. 1 Dist. 1991) 
<TT><P>
<DD>The medical-necessity defense is merely a more particular 
application of the necessity defense, See, e.g., LaFave &amp;  
Scott at &sect; 5.4(c)7, at 631-33; G.E. Torcia, 1 Wharton's Criminal 
Law &sect; 88 (1978); 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law &sect; 50 (1989).&nbsp; In fact, in Bavero v. State, 347 So.2d 781 (Fla. 1st DCA 1977), this court 
recognized the defense of medical necessity there asserted by a 
prison escapee.&nbsp; Accord State v. Alcantaro, 407 So.2d 922, 924 
(Fla. 1st DCA 1981) ("Medical necessity was recognized as an 
arguable defense by this court in Bavero v. State[.]"), review 
denied, 413 So.2d 875 (Fla.1982). 
<P>
<DD>[1]&nbsp; Although the state conceded at oral argument that the 
necessity defense exists in Florida's common law, the state 
nevertheless contends that Section 893.03, Florida Statutes 
(1989), is inconsistent with and therefore precludes the defense 
in the case at bar.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; Section 893.03(1) provides: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>SCHEDULE 1.&nbsp; A substance in Schedule I has a high potential for abuse and has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and in its use under medical supervision does not meet accepted safety standards except for such uses provided for in s. 402.36.&nbsp; The following substances are controlled in Schedule I: 
<P>
<DD>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 
<P>
<DD>(c)4.&nbsp; Cannabis. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(Footnote omitted.)  However, subsection (1)(d) provides, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Notwithstanding the aforementioned fact that Schedule I substances have no currently accepted medical use, the Legislature recognizes that certain substances are currently accepted for certain limited medical uses in treatment in the United States but have a high potential for abuse. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The state argues that section 893.03 permits no medical uses of 
marijuana whatsoever.&nbsp; In fact, all that subsection (1) states is 
that marijuana is not generally available for medical use.  
Subsection (1)(d), however, clearly indicates that Schedule I 
substances may be subject to limited medical uses.&nbsp; It is well 
established that a statute should not be construed as abrogating 
the common law unless it speaks unequivocally, and should not be 
interpreted to displace common law more than is necessary.&nbsp;  
Carlile v. Game &amp; Fresh Water Fish Comm'n, 354 So.2d 362, 364 
(Fla.1977) (quoting 30 Fla.Jur. Statutes &sect; 130 (rev. ed. 1974); 
State v. Egan, 287 So.2d 1, 6-7 (Fla.1973); Sullivan v. 
Leatherman, 48 So.2d 836, 838 (Fla.1950) (en banc).&nbsp; We conclude 
that section 893.03 does not preclude the defense of medical 
necessity under the particular facts of this case. 
<P>
<DD>[2, 3] Moreover, we conclude that the Jenks met their burden 
of establishing this defense at trial.&nbsp; The elements of the 
defense have previously been addressed by trial courts in United 
States v. Randall, 104 Daily Wash.L.Rep. 2249 (Super.Ct.D.C. Nov. 
24, 1976), and in Florida in State v. Mussika, 14 F.L.W. 1 (Fla. 
17th Cir.Ct. Dec. 28, 1988), which both involved the medically 
necessary use of marijuana by people with glaucoma.&nbsp; Those 
elements are as follows: 1. That the defendant did not 
intentionally bring about the circumstance which precipitated the 
unlawful act; 2. That the defendant could not accomplish the same objective using a less offensive alternative available to the 
defendant; and 3. That the evil sought to be avoided was more 
heinous than the unlawful act perpetrated to avoid it. 
<P>
<DD>As applied to the case at bar, the Jenks obviously did not 
intend to contract AIDS. Furthermore, the Jenks' medical expert 
and physician testified that no drug or treatment is available 
that would effectively eliminate or diminish the Jenks' nausea.* 
Finally, the Jenks established that if their nausea was not 
controlled, their lives were

<P><TT>
in danger.*&nbsp; The state put on no evidence that contradicted the 
Jenks, and the trial court had no authority to reject the 
witnesses' testimony.&nbsp; Based upon these facts, we conclude the 
trial court erred in reject ing the Jenks' defense and in 
convicting them as charged. 
<P>
<DD>REVERSED with directions that judgment of acquittal be 
entered.

3.&nbsp; Dr. Sunnenberg testified by stipulation that "he has been 
unable to find any effective drug for treating the defendants' 
nausea," and that "the only drug that controls their nausea is 
Cannabis Sativa."&nbsp; Dr. Dansak testified that there is a drug,

that it must be given intravenously in "fairly whopping doses," 
thus creating problems with infections, particularly in AIDS 
patients.
