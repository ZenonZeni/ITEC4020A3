<P><CENTER><B>TVX GOLD INC. RECEIVES OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION THAT IT IS THE
SUCCESSFUL BIDDER FOR THE KASSANDRA MINES ASSETS IN GREECE</B></CENTER>

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 3, 1995 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that it has received formal notification from Ethniki Kephaleou S.A. (the "Liquidator") of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, that it is the successful bidder for the purchase and development of these assets.

<P>In accordance with the terms of the successful bid and requested improvements, TVX Gold proposes to purchase the Kassandra Mines assets for a purchase price of 11 billion GDr (approximately US$47 million at current exchange rates). The purchase price will be payable as follows:

   <OL TYPE=i>
   <LI>4.5 billion GDr (approximately US$19 million) upon the Closing Date
   <LI>6.5 billion GDr (approximately US$28 million) in five equal installments of 1.3 billion GDr (approximately US$5.6 million) on each of the first,  second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates of the Closing Date, plus interest thereon.
   </OL>

<P>It is anticipated that completion of the formal agreements and the closing of the purchaseof the assets should be concluded by the end of May.

<P>The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region of the Chalkidiki Peninsula in north-eastern Greece, approximately 11 0 km east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometres and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. These assets are being sold by the Liquidator on behalf of creditors. These operations have been uneconomic in the recent past, due largely to lack of modernization and to the non-availability of capital. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, operating as silver/lead/zinc mines. The gold content of the ore was not exploited due to its refractory nature. Although considerable time and money were spent studying the possibility of introducing a plant to recover the gold, this strategy was never implemented due to insufficient funding.

<P>TVX Gold tendered its bid pursuant to a formal auction process conducted by Ethniki Kephaleou S.A. as legal liquidator.  TVX had the opportunity to conduct extensive due diligence studies with its own personnel and expert consultants.  As a result of this due diligence, TVX Gold is confident that the current silver/lead/zinc operations can be rehabilitated and modernized to achieve an efficient, economic operation.  Further, with the introduction of proven pressure oxidation technology, previously tested by Sherritt Gordon and found suitable for the Kassandra refractory ores, the substantial gold potential of the mines can be profitably realized.  Studies to date indicate that gold recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable with the proven pressure oxidation technology.

<P>Current estimates of the total capital cost for this project are approximately US$180 million, to be spent over the next three years.  Of this amount, approximately US$32 million will be spent for the enhancement and modernization of the existing mining and milling operations, including environmental rehabilitation.  This will allow the existing silver/lead/zinc operations to be operating efficiently within 6 months of the Closing Date.  The balance of the capital of approximately US$148 million relates to the construction and implementation of the gold plant, which is anticipated to commence production at 50% capacity within 24 months of the Closing Date, with full capacity being reached one year later.

<P>Due to Greece's membership in and standing with the European Union, there are significant grants available for projects of this type, related to the introduction of new capital and technology, environmental initiatives and employment and retraining.  Because of the importance of this project to the Greek State, the Greek government has provided assurances to TVX Gold that all cooperation will be extended to ensure timely issuance of all necessary licenses and project approvals which may be required and the early approval and implementation of the grants to the maximum levels possible.


<P>The Kassandra Mines orebodies are massive sulfide replacement deposits within Paleozoic marble units often with schists or gneiss in the hanging wall of the ore.  Aplite dikes and sills are abundant in the mineralized zones.  Mineralization is zoned with respect to silver/lead/zinc, and gold mineralization.

<P>Information regarding existing reserves on the Kassandra properties, supplied by the Liquidator as part of the auction process and reviewed by TVX Gold personnel during their due diligence, indicates current reserves at Kassandra of approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 g/t Au (approximately 2.8 million ounces of Au), 100 g/t Ag (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent), 3% Pb, and 4% Zn.  There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite of 250,000 tonnes grading 22.65 g/t Au (approximately 180,000 ounces of Au) and approximately 3 million tonnes of tailings with up to 3 g/t Au (approximately 300,000 ounces of Au).

<P>Based on current plans, TVX Gold anticipates that production of gold would commence approximately 24 months after the Closing Date, with the gold plant operating at approximately 50% capacity. TVX Gold expects production in this first year of operation to be in excess of 190,000 ounces of gold equivalent. In the next three years, when the plant is operating at full capacity, gold equivalent production is expected to exceed 300,000 ounces per year, which includes regular production from the existing mines plus treatment of the existing stockpiles and tailings. Thereafter, after the existing concentrate stockpiles are depleted, production would reduce to levels in excess of 180,000 ounces of gold equivalent per year (unless the further potential on the property justifies an expansion). The current mine plan estimates a mine life of approximately 20 years from the startup of the gold plant. Cash operating costs on a gold equivalent basis are anticipated to be less than US$200 per ounce, taking into account lead and zinc credits. Lead and zinc production, which will commence in the first year after closing, is estimated to reach, on an annualized basis, approximately 27,000 tonnes of zinc and 27,000 tonnes of lead, dropping to around 24,000 tonnes of zinc and 21,000 tonnes of lead annually, after six years of production.

<P>Based on the existing Kassandra Mines information supplied and due diligence work, there appears to be excellent potential for increases in reserves at the existing operations. Also, there are numerous other mineralized zones already identified on this large property, including two copper/gold porphyries, and a large manganese/gold zone. An extensive exploration program on the property will commence after closing.
