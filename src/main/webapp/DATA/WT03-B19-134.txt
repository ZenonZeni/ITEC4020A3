<b>Textiles, Clothing and Footwear (TCF)<br>
Co-operative Export Marketing Program</b>
</FONT><br>
</center>
<p><br>
<p><br><p>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>
To increase the long-term export sales of fashion apparel and
footwear.
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>
Business Victoria has demonstrated, through its Quick Response
program, that cooperation between supply-chain partners (ie manufacturers,
suppliers and retailers) can produce significant marketing benefits.
<P>
Many TCF companies, looking to export markets for their future
growth, are discouraged by the associated high costs and risks
for individual firms.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
A pilot program will be conducted with a group of TCF firms able
to supply a complete &quot;collection&quot; in a selected market niche (eg
active leisure wear and street wear for teenagers).
<P>
The network of companies will collaborate on design (style, colour,
fabrics selection to satisfy the requirements of the target market),
production, costing, packaging and administration.
<P>
The network will agree on a risk aversion policy (what happens
if some products do not sell) and a material re-direction policy.
<P>
Sampling and market trials will precede commercial production.
<H2>Users</H2>
<P>
The pilot program will comprise ten participating TCF firms from
Business Victoria's Quick Response program.
<H2>Outcomes</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Participating firms will benefit from reduced risk through using
the supply chain management capabilities developed through the
Quick Response program.
<LI>Increased efficiencies will accrue from companies working together
to export to selected niche markets.
<LI>If successful, the pilot program can be expanded into other target
markets and geographic areas.
