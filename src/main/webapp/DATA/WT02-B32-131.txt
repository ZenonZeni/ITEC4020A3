<blockquote>

<font size=+2><b>W</b></font>e live at a very rapidly changing point in human history as the
clock winds down on the 20th century and we head into the next
millennium.<p>

When you're trying to decide where to invest money, what career
choices are best, where to live and a myriad of other options, you
need to have an awareness of some of the powerful forces that are
changing our world.<p>

What are some of these forces?<p>

<ol>

<li>   <b><i>MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY:</i></b> the microchip is changing about every
     area of our lives.  Moore's Law states that the maximum
     microchip speed doubles every 18 months.  With this increased
     speed comes the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks
     (ie: video phones, etc.) more efficiently and many more tasks
     yet unimagined.  The microchip essentially spelled the end of
     the industrial age where large governments and large
     corporations thrived, and ushered in the information age.

<li>   <b><i>THE SHRINKING IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT:</i></b> from the death of
     communism to the emergence of free trade, power is passing
     from government to business.  The Canada - U.S. free trade
     agreement saw the U.S. government answer to a higher power for
     the first time in its' history.  Bond and currency traders
     exert enormous power over government policy.  Heading into the
     next century the importance of government will continue to
     shrink while the influence of business will increase.

<li>   <b><i>LARGE TO SMALL:</i></b> large corporations continue to downsize as the
     need for a large administration staff gets replaced by
     technology.  In its' place, there is rapid growth of small
     entrepreneurial companies.  It is estimated that up to half of
     our society may work for themselves before the end of the 21st
     century.

<li>   <b><i>BOOMERNOMICS:</i></b> in Canada and the U.S. there was an unusually
     large percentage of the population born between the late 40's
     and early 60's ... the so-called "baby boomers".  Because
     their numbers are so large they were partly responsible for
     high inflation in the 70's as they reached their consuming
     20's.  As the baby boomers went out to buy their first homes
     in the 80's, real estate surged.  The next 20 years will see
     the boomers in their 40's and 50's, generally considered to be
     the peak savings years.  The billions being poured into
     financial markets, chiefly through mutual funds, is the
     beginning of a trend that will likely be with us for the next
     20 years.

<li>   <b><i>LONGER LIVES:</i></b> with improved medical knowledge and technology,
     people are living longer.  Many feel that, living to well past
     100 will be commonplace in the very near future.  Particularly
     in North America with our baby boomers, we will be living in
     and catering to an aging population in the 21st century. 
     Industries catering to this phenomenon such as medical
     services, health sciences, finance, travel and entertainment
     should be areas of growth.

</ol>

<p>

The above list is by no means exhaustive but does shed some light
on the trends that are shaping our world.  If you are interested in
learning more about the future, see our announcement in "upcoming
