Medicaid per-capita cap proposals may change current
entitlement status, promise state funding conflicts, CBO says; budget
talks stretch into weekend.

MEDICAID PER-CAPITA CAP COULD EXCLUDE ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS, the
Congressional Budget Office concludes in an outline of the provsion
included in President Clinton's Medicaid reform proposal. In a
December memo, CBO states that such "proposals would not necessarily
maintain a true federal entitlement to benefits for the eligible
population groups." CBO states that a "program that capped federal
expenditures per enrollee probably could not meet all" criteria of an
entitlement program; an entitlement program's establishing law "must
describe who is eligible and the benefits to which they are entitled,
as well as assuring that federal funds accommodate changes in
enrollment and in the cost of benefits."
 
The CBO memo raises two specific issues in its discussion of a
per-capita federal "entitlement." First, it notes that "there would
be no guarantee that all populations currently covered by the
Medicaid program would continue to be eligible," since "states might
cut back on coverage of high-cost optional groups" or eliminate
optional services as a means of keeping "expenditures below the cap
amounts."
 
Secondly, according to CBO, "it is much less clear...what would
happen if the caps were sufficiently constraining in some states that
access to services for entitled populations was seriously limited."
CBO explains further that whether beneficiaries could accordingly sue
the state and/or federal governments, "and the resulting implications
for Medicaid expenditures, would depend critically on whether and how
the individual entitlement was defined in the law."
 
While congressional Republicans included in their vetoed budget
package a move from Medicaid's individual entitlement to a
"Medigrant" block grant to states, the White House and several
centrist groups of lawmakers have offered per-capita cap proposals
that they claim would preserve an individual entitlement. However,
both the White House and the conservative House Democratic
"Coalition" have been denied CBO scoring of any savings to their cap
as CBO has cited insufficient legislative detail.
 
The gap between the block grant and per-capita cap in Medicaid
policy may be the most contentious aspect of budget negotiations.
Talks resumed Dec. 29 involving President Clinton, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich (R-Ga.), and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.);
Gingrich forecast that "this is the weekend where we get it all
done." Both sides expressed their willingness to work through the
weekend into the new year.
 
Earlier in the day, White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta met
with congressional Budget Committee leadership, after which Rep. John
Kasich (R-Ohio) reported that both sides began a "give and take." The
budgeteers planned to reconvene that evening following the White
House session, and Dole said talks with the President would continue
on Dec. 30. Both sides expected to rapidly pass legislation over the
weekend allowing furloughed federal employees to return to work.
 
Addressing another issue with Medicaid per-capita caps, the CBO
memo also notes that states "could use a variety of methods to keep
their average expenditures below the cap amounts" and that some
methods "might raise, rather than lower, aggregate federal Medicaid
expenditures." Since "improvements in efficiency alone would probably
be insufficient to maintain expenditures below the cap" under tight
constraints, states might employ tactics such as shifting enrollees
from lower-cost groups to higher-cost groups that have higher
per-capita caps. CBO added that states might also "increase their
efforts to shift more of the costs of the elderly and the disabled to
the Medicare program, likewise lowering average Medicaid expenditures
per enrollee but raising total federal spending."
 
As a further consideration with per-capita cap proposals, CBO
reported that funding to states "would raise some of the same equity
questions as block grants." Both determining base year per capita
amounts and annual growth rates would be important policy decisions.
Since states' caps would likely be based on their historical
expenditure patterns, "states with high expenditures per beneficiary
would be able to lock in higher caps than states with low
expenditures per beneficiary." Low-cost states with rapid beneficiary
growth could receive a mixed bag; "some of the negative effects" of
lower caps "might be mitigated by the fact that enrollment would not
be constrained." However, for other low-cost states, "basing the per
capita caps on the existing wide discrepancies among the states would
be more problematic."

Medicare growth rate increases likely under MedicarePlus
provisions in White House, Republican budget plans, American Academy
of Actuaries report concludes.

GOP/CLINTON MEDICAREPLUS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES COULD INCREASE
PROGRAM GROWTH rates rather than reduce Medicare expenditures,
according to a recent report prepared by the American Academy of
Actuaries. Commenting on the congressional Republican and the Clinton
Administration Medicare reform plans, AAA concludes that "the
intended geographic reconfiguration of the payment rates will tend to
increase Medicare expenditures, rather than reduce them." The report
authors are AAA Medicare workgroup chairman Guy King and members
David Axene, Solomon Mussey, David Kerr, Walter Liptak, Robert Lynch,
and David Wille.
 
The report states that in areas where new capitation payments
will be higher than under current law, new enrollment in Medicare
Plus plans will increase expenditures; however in these areas
financial incentives for beneficiaries to join new plans will be
increased. AAA argues that in areas where new capitation payments
will be less than under current law, new enrollment will reduce
expenditures; however, these are areas where financial incentives for
beneficiaries to join new plans will be diminished. The academy
emphasizes that the growth rate targets may not be reachable due to
the lack of incentives in areas where new enrollment could achieve
savings from the program.
 
AAA also states that capitation payments under the GOP plan will
rise faster than the rates designated by law. The report notes that
the Medicare Preservation Act specifies a minimum capitation payment
of $300 per month in 1996, and $350 in 1997. "But the law also says
that no capitation payment can ever increase by less than 2%
annually," according to the report. AAA concludes that "the increases
in capitation payments in the counties where these minimums apply
will make average rates rise more rapidly than the rates designated
in the law."
 
"Two significant deficiencies" in both the GOP and Clinton
Administration proposals are that they rely heavily on provider
payment reductions, the report states. The academy argues that
"reducing unit payments won't produce incentives for reducing the
rate of growth in health expenditures." The report notes "in many
cases, the rate of growth in volume and intensity of services,
increases when unit payments are lowered." In addition, the fail-safe
mechanism in the GOP plan provides no incentives for more
cost-effective delivery of health care, according to the report.
 
Second, the academy states that the structure of payments in both
proposals allows providers to choose capitation over fee-for-service
payments "if it turns out that capitation payments provide more
revenue" to providers. The Administration and GOP proposals "merely"
offer providers an alternative payment mechanism for maximizing
Medicare revenues, the academy contends.
 
The academy predicts that the Administration proposal would not
significantly impact the long-range actuarial deficit in the Hospital
Insurance program. The report states that President Clinton's
proposal employs "an accounting trick," by transferring part of the
obligation to pay for home health benefits from the HI trust fund to
the supplementary medical insurance trust fund, without a
corresponding increase in the Part B premium. Expected to make the HI
program meet short-range solvency standards, the tactic undermines
"the fiscal discipline imposed by the trust fund, and makes it
possible to avoid producing genuine, effective reform," AAA
concludes.
 
The academy lists several recommendations for improving the
proposals, in addition to suggesting less reliance on provider
payment reductions, elimination of "tricks in the HI program" and
substitution of market- based capitation rates under the MedicarePlus
plan. One recommendation includes providing financial incentives for
beneficiaries to join MedicarePlus plans in the form of increased
out-of-pocket payments such as co-payments and deductibles for
beneficiaries desiring to stay in fee-for-service.
 
Also the Academy's workgroup notes that the fail-safe mechanism
should be retained, but should be modified to increase program
deductibles if expenditures exceed the allowances. The report states
that this modification will ensure that providers do not refuse care
to Medicare beneficiaries because payments are inadequate. A final
recommendation notes that the legislation should provide a mechanism
to deal with long-range financial instability of the HI program,
"even if the mechanism is nothing more than the appointment of a
bipartisan commission to study the problem."

Ivax begins shipping generic albuterol metered-dose inhaler
Dec. 29 following approval of generic equivalent to Glaxo's Ventolin.

IVAX BEGINS SHIPMENTS OF GENERIC VERSION OF GLAXO's VENTOLIN
metered-dose inhaler on Dec. 29, less than 24 hours after FDA
approval of the albuterol product. The company will market the
albuterol metered-dose inhaler approved on Dec. 28 through its Zenith
Goldine subsidiary. The asthma treatment is made at Ivax' Norton
subsidiary Waterford, Ireland plant. Schering-Plough also markets an
albuterol MDI under the brand name Proventil.
 
Ivax has sold over 28 mil. albuterol inhalers in over 30
countries worldwide. The albuterol approval gives Ivax a total of 18
ANDA approvals in 1995 for 12 different chemical compounds, the
company reports.
 
The FDA approval for the controversial generic drug during the
late 1995 holiday season ends an almost seven-year effort by brand
name manufacturers to block clearance of the nonsystemically absorbed
product. As of Dec. 29, none of the innovator companies had taken
legal action against the approval.
 
In a Dec. 29 "Talk Paper," FDA declared the Ivax product "safe
and effective as the brand name product" based on "a series of
laboratory analyses and in vivo tests in humans."
 
FDA lays out the bioequivalence tests that supported the approval
of the generic albuterol MDI, which included in vitro particle and
plume tests, bronchoprovocation studies in asthmatics, and
cardiovascular and metabolic tests in healthy volunteers.
 
In vitro performance tests for aerosol products "determined the
equivalence or similarity of the generic and brand name products for
the delivered amount of albuterol, the particle size and the shape of
the aerosol cloud produced by both products."
 
In the bronchoprovocation study, "the equivalence of the
pharmacological action of albuterol MDIs was established by comparing
the generic version and the brand name product's capacity to protect
the airways from constriction induced by histamine."
 
The agency adds that "the bioequivalence of the generic albuterol
MDI and Ventolin MDI was also confirmed by comparing the
cardiovascular and metabolic effects of these products in healthy
people at exposure levels substantially exceeding the recommended
therapeutic doses."

FDA sets RDIs for six nutrients, including vitamin K and
selenium; agency publishes DSHEA implementing regs Dec. 28.

FDA SETS RDIs FOR SIX NUTRIENTS, INCLUDING SELENIUM, CHROMIUM,
vitamin K, molybdenum, chloride and manganese in a final rule
published in the Dec. 28 Federal Register. Initially, in a proposed
rule published in January 1994, the agency considered reference daily
intakes (RDIs) for seven nutrients--these six and fluoride. The
agency established the rule in order to extend RDIs to essential
nutrients not covered in previous rules.
 
"These actions are intended to assist consumers in understanding
the nutritional significance of foods in the context of a total daily
diet and are in recognition of the fact that the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and
Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDIs) for"
these six nutrients, FDA states. The agency develops RDIs as a way of
communicating dietary information to consumers on the new "nutrition
facts" and "supplement facts" boxes on food and dietary supplement
products.
 
FDA decided to drop fluoride from consideration for an RDI
because, it notes, "fluoride does not meet the first criterion" for
assigning a nutrient an RDI, "namely, that there is significant
scientific consensus as to the essentiality of the nutrient." NAS,
the agency explained, said that study results so far justify no
classification of fluoride as essential.
 
The agency clarified that it had, in the proposed rule,
"mistakenly proposed an RDI for each nutrient listed in the NAS' RDA
and ESADDI tables...[failing] to focus on the fact that, unlike other
nutrients listed, the supporting text did not conclude that fluoride
is an essential element."
 
The RDIs set for vitamin K (80 mcg), selenium (70 mcg) and
chloride (3,400 mg) are the same as those proposed by FDA in the
earlier rule. However, because of a change in methodology for
determining RDIs for nutrients with ESADDIs, FDA is proposing lower
RDIs for manganese (previously 3.5 mg, now 2 mg); chromium
(previously 130 mcg, now 120 mcg); and molybdenum (previously 160
mcg, now 75 mcg).
 
The agency "intends to propose to establish RDIs for infants,
children less than four years, and pregnant and lactating women in
the near future. In that proposal the agency intends to address all
nutrients for which RDIs have been established for adults and
children four or more years of age."
 
The final rule establishing new RDIs is one of four rules
affecting dietary supplement labeling published in the Dec. 28
Federal Register. Also published are three proposed rules --
essentially implementing regs for the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1994 -- that cover the "how tos" of nutrition and
ingredient labeling, nutritional support claims, and "high potency",
"antioxidant", and "sugar-free" claims.
 
The nutrition and ingredient labeling proposed rule sets out
FDA's interpretation of dietary supplement labeling under DSHEA and
the Nutrition Labeling & Education Act. Under FDA's proposal, some
dietary supplements, including herbal and fatty acid products, may
have to include information on calories and amounts of carbohydrates
(sugars) or fats. In addition, FDA is proposing to list ingredients
and amounts on a "per serving" basis rather than on a per dose basis.
 
FDA would allow "high potency" claims for products with one
dietary ingredient at a level of 100% of the RDI. For dietary
supplement products that contain more than one dietary ingredient, at
least two-thirds of the ingredients in the product for which there is
an RDI or DRV (daily reference value) would have to be at 100% of
that level. The proposal will only allow "antioxidant" claims to be
made for dietary supplements that contain beta carotene, vitamin C
and/or vitamin E.
