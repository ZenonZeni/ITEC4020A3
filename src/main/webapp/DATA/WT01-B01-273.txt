<P>This area of Learn@Home is set aside for future essays and articles in the legal realm of home education.<BR>

<P><B>Who to contact / Who gets paperwork</B><BR>
In our modern world filled with forms and paperwork, home education is not exempt. All states across our country have some requirement of notification and filing for home schooling families. Unfortunately, those requirements can vary from state to state with differing levels of enforcement from county to county. The first place to make contact if your family is considering home schooling should be one of your state associations and/or local support groups. These organizations keep themselves well apprised of the local requirements. They will know who to contact and who gets any required forms and notification. The other contact that should be made is with the Home School Legal Defense Association. All of these groups have a place of their own in our <B>Community</B> section. These contacts are invaluable in keeping up with the legal requirements of home education.<BR>
