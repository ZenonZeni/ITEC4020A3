Gimps and the GOP - Wednesday, August 14
</title>

<body>

<h3>Wednesday, August 14</h3>
<h2>An Inspiration to Us All</h2>

<p>SAN DIEGO - Of course, there's being used, and then there's being used.
<p>The GOP is working the disability angle, and working it hard.  Tonight's highlight: Elizabeth Dole parading back and forth in front of the podium, clutching a microphone in one hand and "bonding" with the audience.  She's obviously been taking lessons from the Sally Jesse Raphael School of Communications . . .  putting her arm around a wheelchair user in the front row and telling the convention what an "inspiration" he is . . . telling the story of her husband's injury, how he was totally paralyzed until he "willed himself" to walk again, how he owes so much of his recovery to one of his teachers, who refused to let him lie around and feel sorry for himself . . . 
<p>Didn't we see this once on "The Fact of Life"?  Or was it "Diff'rent Strokes"?  It was on a "very special episode" of something, I know that much.
<p>Welcome to the world of the Inspirational Cripple.  Mrs. Dole's performance tonight was a sharp contrast to her husband's remarks to San Diegans with disabilities the day before.  Bob Dole wouldn't have dared call his audience "an inspiration."  His remarks were all about civil rights and self-empowerment - Mrs. Dole's, on the other hand, was the same old same-old about how success is merely a matter of taking a positive attitude and "overcoming" our disabilities.
<p>Which, of course, is what most ABs - and not just AB Republicans - want desperately to believe.
<hr>
<p>During the roll call of delegates (which is just as tedious in person as it is on TV, by the way), I sat chatting with one of the convention's security guards, a young black man who, like many of the people working the convention, is a Republican.  Nevertheless, he was getting weary of the constant parade of African-American success stories designed, apparently, to show the electorate that the GOP could be just as prone to white guilt as the Democrats.
<p>"Miracles do happen," he said, referring to people who, through their own effort, overcome their own circumstances and raised themselves out of poverty, "but they're rare.  And for every one there are others who cannot get out."
<p>That's why they're called miracles, after all.
<p>Of course, the Republicans would counter by saying the reasons so many people are trapped in poverty are that government programs discourage them from working and that "Hollywood anti-heroes" (another popular catch-phrase around here) encourage personal irresponsibility.  And a fair number of people with disabilities would probably agree with that sentiment.  Anyone who's ever dealt with SSI/SSDI income restrictions knows what a work disincentive is.  And how many times have we seen ourselves depicted in movies and on TV as helpless and pathetic?
<p>But there's a long way to go from here to believing that prejudice and discrimination are all a matter of "attitude."
<hr>
<p>On top of the sign for the Alaska delegation there sits a stuffed animal.  I had to look twice before realizing that it was supposed to be a polar bear.  At first I thought it was a stuffed baby harp seal.
