<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>A dramatic new treatment puts the 
<BR>
cure in your hands as Dr. Nambudripad shows 
<BR>
you how to stay free of allergies for life
</CENTER></H3>

<P>
For the 35 million Americans who know they have allergies and who want a better
way to get over them, the treatment discoveries of California acupuncturist Devi
S. Nambudripad, D.C., O.M.D., Ph.D., will come as good news. But for the 50% of
Americans-128 million people-who suffer from problems caused, unknown to them,
by allergies, Dr. Nambudripad's techniques will come as a great surprise.
<P>
For the last 12 years, she's been using her own discovery, the Nambudripad
Allergy Elimination Technique (NAET), at her Buena Park, California, clinic, to
permanently heal between 80-90% of her  patients' hidden allergies. People come
to her from all over America for this unprecedented degree of relief. She's
taught NAET to about 625 other doctors which means this innovative allergy cure
is now available in many parts of the U.S.
<P>
This couldn't come at a better time because according to Dr. Nambudripad, far
more people have allergies than doctors, or the patients themselves,  have ever
suspected.
<P>
The shocking fact is that "there is hardly any human disease or condition in
which allergic factors are not involved," claims Dr. Nambudripad. Even more
challenging is this statement: "Any substance under the sun, including sunlight
itself, can cause an allergic reaction in any individual."
<P>
In other words,  potentially you can be  allergic to anything. If you check with
enough people, as Nambudripad has, you'll find  allergies to almost everything.
Foods, clothing, plants, chemicals, vitamins, tap water, vaccines, furniture,
plastic, metals,  wedding rings,  piano keys, water, heat, acrylic fingernails,
saliva, even your own adrenaline-the list is staggering. <A HREF="#CHART">(See below, 
"You Can Be Allergic to Nearly Anything")</A>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Your brain  re-interprets what it used to think was a poison, seeing it
 now as a
harmless, acceptable substance. "This produces a totally new, permanent and
irreversible response to the allergen," Nambudripad says. Your nervous system
learns a different response to the same stimulus and you are suddenly
allergy-free.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
Undiagnosed allergies can produce symptoms, illnesses, even chronic diseases
like cancer, that affect every system and organ in your body. Chronic fatigue,
migraines, hyperactivity, arthritis, asthma, anxiety, depression, backaches,
addictions-all these and more can be allergy-based. Unless you understand the
secret of allergies, you may spend years fruitlessly visiting medical
specialists, never getting better.
<P>
In her bold new book, Say Goodbye to Illness, Dr. Nambudripad promises to
"revolutionize the practice of medicine." It may sound like an exaggeration, but
for Nambudripad, who is a licensed chiropractor, acupuncturist, registered
nurse, and a Ph.D., it's the simple truth. Dozens of dramatic case studies
presented in her book support her strong claim.
<P>
Diagnosing hidden allergies in itself is not revolutionary. Environmental
medicine has been doing that for several decades. Usually you remove the
allergenic substance from your life, go on a rotation diet, and you can manage.
But Nambudripad's techniques  allow you to continue using the very substance
that has made you sick-and without any further bad results.
<P>
The secret to NAET is to retrain  your brain and nervous system to no longer
react to the offending substance. "We can reprogram our brains to perceive
unsuitable energies as suitable ones and use them for our benefit rather than
allow them to cause energy blockages and imbalances." Let's see how this works
in a few stories from her clinic.
<P>
Susan was a 19 year old woman, newly married, who came to Nambudripad
complaining of severe lower back pain. She'd suffered with this for 5 days, and
was now having fever, chills, and severe headaches.  A urine test suggested a
possible kidney infection. Aspirin and a light antibiotic helped reduce her
symptoms. Then she had a cup of fenugreek herbal tea. Within 10 minutes she had
an intense reaction: chills, muscular stiffness, and high fever.
<P>
Nambudripad tested her at once for an allergy to fenugreek tea then used NAET to
lower her temperature to normal within 30 minutes. It turns out Susan had drunk
fenugreek tea 5 days earlier as well, starting the chain reaction of symptoms.
<P>
Thomas was a computer programmer, age 28, who started experiencing extreme
fatigue only a year after taking a new job. He was so tired he started to hate
going to work. His job performance  dropped, he could barely walk without
somebody's help, and soon he was diagnosed as having chronic fatigue syndrome.
He took time off from work, seemingly facing a grim future. Yet he started to
feel better, just by being home. But when he returned to work, he got worse
again.
<P><A NAME="COMPUTER"> </A>
This cycle continued for 4 years until he had the good fortune to visit Dr.
Nambudripad. She tested Thomas for allergies and found he was allergic to the
plastic material  of his computer keyboard and to computer screen radiation. She
used NAET on Thomas and he was able to resume full-time work with no further
allergic reactions.
<P>
How is this possible? Normally, you remove the allergenic substance and stay
away from it forevermore, yet here are Susan and Thomas able to resume living
while in contact with a substance that had made them terribly sick. The secret
of NAET  lies in the energy pathways through the body that acupuncture calls
meridians.
<P>
Here's what happens, according to Dr. Nambudripad. Your energy system and brain
interpret a particular substance as potentially harmful to your body.  For other
people this item-a diamond ring, a carob-coated cherry, a peanut, hot water-is a
harmless, everyday item; but for your system, it's toxic. Your energy pathways
freeze up as a way of defending the body against this unsuitable substance. This
in turn blocks your energy meridians and if the condition never changes, the
overall functioning of your body suffers.
<P>
"With the first bite of most allergic foods, the brain begins to block the
energy channels to prevent the entrance of the adverse energy  of the food into
the body," Nambudripad explains. This is what produces allergies. In Susan's
case, it was her kidney meridian that got blocked and kept generating the
allergic symptoms of fever, chills, headaches, and kidney infection. "The sudden
blocking of the meridians is one of the quickest defense mechanisms of the brain
to stop the allergen from entering deeper into the body."
<P>
So, the offending substance causes an energy disturbance in a meridian, this
blocks the energy flow,  the body becomes unbalanced, symptoms show up, and
eventually, you get sick.
<P>
But how can Nambudripad figure out what is the offending substance in the first
place? She uses an ingenious technique called muscle testing, familiar to
chiropractors as Applied Kinesiology. (See <I>Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide,</I> 
"Applied Kine-siology," pp. 47-52.)
<P>
The idea is simple: the patient holds a substance that you think produces
allergies while the physician tests the strength of certain muscles. You extend
your arm and resist as Nambudripad gently tries to push it down. Allergenic
substances weaken your muscles, so if you arm goes down, you're probably
allergic to the substance you're holding in your other hand. This is something
you can do at home with a partner whenever you suspect an allergy, as the
section below, <A HREF="#DETECT">("How to be Your Allergy Detective")</A> shows.
<P>
This is quick and straightforward if you already suspect a substance. But if
you're not sure, Nambudripad uses a faster, computerized system of muscle
testing based on the principle of electroacupuncture and biofeedback. 
<P><HR WIDTH=90%>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>the genius of Nambudripad's
approach: it takes the  allergy out of any substance and turns the allergic body
into the allergy-free body.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
This device (see <I>Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide,</I> 
"Energy Medicine, pp. 192-204 and
<A HREF="i06-a04.shtml">"Prevention-you Can See Disease Coming" by Burton Goldberg,
this issue</A>) registers minute changes in
electrical response through your skin, mainly your fingertips, as you hold
different materials. It gives Dr. Nambudripad an idea of the intensity of the
allergy on a scale of 0-100. It's a fast, thorough, and efficient way to find
out what a person is allergic to, says Nambudripad.
<P>
The next step is to actually reprogram the patient's nervous system not to react
anymore to the allergenic substance. This is the genius of Nambudripad's
approach: it takes the  allergy out of any substance and turns the allergic body
into the allergy-free body.

<P>
Remember Susan and the fenugreek tea? Dr. Nambudripad used finger-delivered
acupressure (she'll also use needle-based acupuncture when appropriate) to treat
Susan's kidney meridian and organ imbalance at the same time Susan held the
fenugreek tea in her hand.  The effect is to reorganize the body's way of
reacting to a substance. Because the energy pathways are unblocked, your body
does not have to defensively recoil every time it comes in contact with
fenugreek, or computer plastics, or hundreds of other allergenic substances.
<P>
Your brain  re-interprets what it used to think was a poison, seeing it now as a
harmless, acceptable substance. "This produces a totally new, permanent and
irreversible response to the allergen," Nambudripad says. Your nervous system
learns a different response to the same stimulus and you are suddenly
allergy-free.
<P>
Using Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques, you undo your body's
conditioned response and allow it to co-exist again with everyday items.  You
only have to stay away from the substance for 24 hours as your energy meridians
"reset" themselves.
<P>
Let's not forget, too, that in hundreds of cases, NAET transforms people who are
acutely or chronically ill into healthy, happy, functioning allergy-free human
beings again.
<P>
"Is a permanent cure for allergies possible? At last the answer is a definite
yes, "Nambudripad says.  "You can retrain the body to go back to its original
function, so you can make the  nervous system accept the presence of other
rejected items without creating blockages or unpleasantness in the body."
<P>
Dr. Nambudripad learned the principles of NAET the best possible way-through
being sick herself. She was sick since childhood with multiple illnesses. She
had eczema, arthritis, joint aches, bronchitis, insomnia, clinical depression,
sinusitis, migraine headaches, chronic exhaustion, plus she suffered 3
miscarriages. 
<P>
By the time she arrived in Los Angeles nearly 20 years ago from India, she was
taking 30 aspirin a day to survive. She tried all sorts of doctors, techniques,
medicines, herbs, vitamins, and nutritional programs, but everything made her
worse. The only things she wasn't allergic to were white rice and broccoli.
"Every inch of my body ached."
<P>
Finally, she stumbled upon an acupuncturist who tested her for allergies. He was
the first physician Nambudripad encountered who made the link between her rather
stunning list of problems and undiagnosed allergies. "I followed my teacher's
advice and ate white rice and broccoli exclusively." All of her symptoms started
to lift, but as soon as she started to add more items to her food list, the
allergic reactions returned. "I was simply allergic to everything under the
sun."
<P>
Was she to live on rice and broccoli the rest of her life? That is what she did
for the next 42 months. Then one day she ate a carrot and made a discovery that
led to NAET.
<P>
After eating only a few bites of carrot, Nambudripad instantly felt tired and
lethargic, as if she were going to faint. She used muscle testing on herself and
learned she was highly allergic to carrots. Was this to be just another item
added to her list of untouchable substances? No. This time Nambudripad had an
idea.
<P>
She gave herself an acupuncture treatment, working the points she knew would
keep her awake or from going into shock. Then she slept for 45 minutes. When she
woke, she felt completely different, no longer sick and tired. Compared to how
she'd felt for years, this was a new state of "supreme well-being." Then she
looked at her hands. She was still holding pieces of carrot.
<P>
That's when she saw the link between holding the allergenic substanc within your
body's electromagnetic field while receiving a treatment for adverse food
reaction. Somehow the combination of the two took the allergic charge out of the
carrots. Her body was no longer repulsed by the energy of the carrots. To prove
it, she ate a carrot and had no allergic reaction. She tested her muscles for
carrots and got nothing. Carrots had lost their allergic bite.
<P>
The result is NAET. In the last 12 years of clinical use it has entirely
relieved allergy symptoms or produced satisfactory improvements in 80-90% of her
patients, which number in the thousands. "In every case, allergies were cleared
out, never to return." And all this without any strict rotation or elimination
diets to avoid the allergy-producing substance.
<P>
The experience opened Nambudripad's eyes to a new world of cause and effect in
understanding allergies.  "I discovered that although it has been gaining
acceptance as a separate area of medical study in the last few years, allergy
certainly has not been given the recognition it deserves as a primary cause of
many types of disorders and illnesses."
<P>
Both physicians and patients attest to the high degree of success with NAET. 
Many have said goodbye to illnesses they thought were permanent afflictions.

<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
"Dr. Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique is the most incredible practice
tool I have seen in health care in my 40 years of practice," states chiropractor
John Kasler, D.C., of Charlotte, North Carolina. "I have seen NAET put my
extremely sick patients back in control of their lives once again," comments
acupuncturist Jan K. Steele, L.Ac., O.M.D. "After completion of an NAET
treat-ment program, they are free of symptoms, free of excessive medication, and
free once again to enjoy good health."
<P>
Ask Novato, California, chiropractor Dr. Eleanor Chin, D.C., about NAET, and you
get more positive feedback. "NAET is a practical potent, and proven method of
changing the body's unbalanced response to a substance, be it food or
environmental. A number of my patients have told me that this work is the single
most powerful booster of their immune function, while also integrating the mind,
body, and emotional aspects of healing."
<P>
Even the allergy specialists, such as environmental medicine physician, Sandra
Denton, M.D., of the Alaska Alternative Medicine Center in Anchorage, admit that
NAET has shown them something new about treating allergies.
<P>
Dr. Denton herself had endured chronic fatigue syndrome and serious asthma for
years until Dr. Nambudripad revealed the host of substances she was allergic to
and freed her body of its need to react against them. "She pointed out to me
that many health problems in people all over the world are undiagnosed allergic
reactions or due to the lowering of the immune system by multiple allergic
reactions that allow diseases to attack the weakened host," Denton says.
<P>
Perhaps this patient's comment from an NAET-using acupuncturist's casebook says
it all: "I felt as if I was let out of jail, that I escaped from allergy hell!"
This happy patient, like many others, has seen there is a way to transform the
allergic body into a healthy, balanced, and livable body.

According to Dr. Namudripad, here's how you and a partner can quickly identify which particular substance you're allergic to so you don't have to suffer your body's allergic reaction to it anymore....
        <UL><LI>STEP 1: Lie down in a flat surface, table, bed, or floor, your arms at your side. 
        <LI>STEP 2: Raise your left arm to a 90° angle. As the tester tries to push it down towards your toes, pushing lightly against the hand or forearm, gently resist it. Tester applies 5-10# pressure for 3-5 seconds.
        <LI>STEP 3: If your arm goes weak right away, your energy is unbalanced. Tester places right forefinger at a point 1.5 inches below the navel and left forefinger at base of sternum. Gently tap these two points simultaneously with the fingertip for 20 seconds. 
        <LI>STEP 4: Retest the arm, following STEP 2. If the arm remains strong, go to STEP 5.
        <LI>STEP 5: In your writing hand, hold the substance you suspect you are allergic to. Make sure your fingernails are scrubbed clean and carry no trace of perfume or other substances.          
        <LI>STEP 6: Tester presses against each of the 12 meridian points one by one, trying to push your arm down at the same time. Use the tip of your index finger to apply light pressure for 60 seconds at each point. Where your arm goes weak and drops down, that is the acupuncture meridian that is blocked by the substance in your hand.
        <LI>STEP 7: Remove the allergenic substance from your energy field. Do not eat it or use it. Make an appointment with one of the 600 practitioners of NAET to reprogram your nervous system to not react to this substance any more.
