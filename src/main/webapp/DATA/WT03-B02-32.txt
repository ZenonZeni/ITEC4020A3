Insurance Bill Targeted by Opponents


Congress returns today to tackle a spring agenda laden with health
care possibilities, the most notable being a pending Senate
insurance reform bill that conservatives are targeting for
destruction.
Conservatives wary of Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kan) insurance bill
(S 1028), scheduled for debate later this spring, are designing a
"mutually assured destruction" campaign, says one lobbyist. They
are mulling introduction of controversial amendments such as
medical malpractice and medical savings accounts, and pushing
alternative legislation to expand COBRA or reform only the group
insurance market; S 1028 would dip into the individual market.
S 1028 opponents also may try to temper the effect of the bill by
attaching legislation (S 539) allowing tax-exempt status for state
risk pools; states with pools up and running would be exempt from
the Kassebaum insurer mandates.
In the House, GOP staffers want to move ahead with Rep. Bill
Thomas' (R-Calif) portability bill (HR 1610), but party leaders are
still deciding when to proceed, how to divide up committee
jurisdiction, and whether to add other health tax items.
S 1028's provision allowing portability for individual-market
purchasers leaving group plans is the subject of dueling actuarial
studies. The independent American Academy of Actuaries and the
non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) last week said in
separate reports that the provision would hike premiums between
1%-5%, while the Health Insurance Assn. of America (HIAA), which
opposes the provision, maintained rates would rise 10%-20%.
The discrepancy is rooted in different assumptions about state
reactions to the bill. The academy and CRS assume most states will
regulate individual-market premiums to protect new entrants but let
carriers charge high-risk persons up to 100% more than the average
rate. HIAA assumes states won't allow any rate variation.
A sleeper amendment is Senate Budget Committee Chair Pete
Domenici's (R-NM) initiative to establish parity between mental
health and other health benefits. Actuaries say big bucks are at
stake, but GOP members are wary of making waves.
Meanwhile, ERISA expansion legislation is scheduled for an early
March vote; an administrative simplification bill will be marked up
in April. Those issues, as well as antitrust, could come to a head
should insurance reform gather steam, sources say.

Medicaid Proposal Evolving; Medicare Reform Still
Stalled


A month ago, Medicare reform was front and center, while Medicaid
talks were stalled. Today, the political winds are blowing in the
opposite direction.
Congressional leaders and a bipartisan group of National Governors'
Assn. (NGA) members are working to refine and expand the
NGA-approved Medicaid proposal that has quickly drawn criticism
from most Democrats and liberal interest groups. Reform proponents
are pushing GOP leaders to draft and attach Medicaid and welfare
legislation to a bill extending the debt limit, which expires March
15.
However, a bill hasn't yet been drafted, and governors already are
still tweaking the NGA outline. The original proposal would have
given states total flexibility on amount, scope and duration of
benefits, but governors are mulling floor thresholds for quality,
such as minimum HMO requirements in each state.
The governors also may also nix their proposal to reduce the
maximum state matching percentage from 50% to 40%, set some minimum
definition of "disabled," and increase the proposal's federally
defined benefits package. Also subject to discussion are the
proposed repeal of state schemes to maximize federal matching funds
(WHW 11/6/95, p. 2) and whether to repeal the existing Medicaid
statute.
Medicare reform has an outside chance of being tacked onto debt
ceiling legislation, but House leaders are said to be "skeptical"
of initiating another reform push. House leaders trying to keep the
issue alive have floated $168 billion in seven-year savings that
are more modest than previous proposals.
The latest plan would keep Part B premiums at 25%; delay the
Medicare capitation payment floor by a year; let the feds oversee
provider networks; reduce Part A payment cuts to hospitals, skilled
nursing facilities and home health providers; and exempt physician
office labs from federal standards.

Certain Nurses Can Unionize Under New NLRB Rulings


Nurses who work as professional, non-supervisory employees have the
right to unionize and engage in other concerted activity without
the fear of being fired, under two National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) rulings issued earlier this month.
The American Nurses Assn. cheered the decisions, saying they remove
a tactic employers have used to impede union organizing by
registered nurses (RNs). The American Hospital Assn. opposes the
decisions, fearing they will encourage unions to organize nurses.
NLRB ruled that charge nurses at Providence Hospital in Anchorage,
Alaska, are not "supervisors" and therefore are protected by the
National Labor Relations Act. That law bars supervisors from
unionizing. Charge nurses are those in charge of a unit or floor.
In a companion case, NLRB ruled that licensed practical nurses at
Ten Broeck Commons, a New York nursing home, oversaw the work of
certified nursing assistants in a routine manner, without being
supervisors under the federal law.
The rulings have favorable implications for nurses about 60 other
nurses' cases before the NLRB.

IRS Issues Family Leave Rule For Cafeteria Plans


The IRS recently proposed guidelines for employers offering
flexible benefit programs whose workers take leave under the Family
and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), as well as guidance for firms in
which ex-workers and/or dependents choose COBRA coverage.
Final regulations for FMLA, enacted in 1993, were issued in January
1995, but were generally silent on treatment of flexible benefit
programs, also called cafeteria plans. The law allows workers to
take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family reasons or illness.
The new rules stipulate that firms offering Sec. 125 cafeteria
plans - in which workers are given an allotted pot of pre-tax money
to choose from an array of health plans and other benefits - can
collect health plan premium contributions from employees taking
unpaid FMLA leave in three ways: (1) pre-pay, in which workers
would pay before leave begins; (2) pay-as-you-go, in which workers
pay on the same schedule as if they were not on leave; and (3)
catch-up, in which employees pay upon returning to work.
For cafeteria plans offering flexible spending accounts (FSAs) "
into which employers put pre-tax dollars for workers' medical or
dependent-care costs - the IRS proposes FSAs be subject to the same
rules as other health plans for workers on family leave. Thus,
workers may revoke their health plan selections while on leave, but
firms must allow reinstatement upon their return. Those electing
continuation coverage during leave are subject to normal uniform
coverage laws.
Separately, the IRS specified when firms can charge COBRA
participants the family rate. The guidance says if a worker and
spouse elect COBRA together, the employer may charge 102% of the
family premium; if only a spouse or dependent child does, 102% of
the individual rate applies.

Medicare Supplemental Suit Alleges Systematic Overbilling


Asserting that hundreds of thousands of Medicare supplemental
insurance policyholders nationwide have been systematically and
intentionally overcharged, physician-patient advocates this month
filed a class action suit against the Prudential Insurance Co. Byan
v. Prudential, No. 600650/96 (N.Y. Sup.Ct., filed Feb. 8, 1996).
The case is said to be the first of its kind, but if it succeeds,
similar suits may be filed against other insurers, says Yvonne
Archer, executive director of the League of Physicians and
Surgeons, which supports the suit. Medicare supplemental insurance
provides benefits that Medicare doesn't cover, including
copayments, deductibles and prescription drugs.
At issue in the New York lawsuit are deluxe versions of policies
sponsored by the American Assn. of Retired Persons (AARP) and sold
by Prudential. Such policies allow members to see
non-Medicare-participating physicians and pay the difference
between the Medicare allowable fee and an MD's "usual and
prevailing" charge.
The plaintiffs, represented by the New York-based law firm Landy &
Seymour, say Pru didn't pay that difference and intentionally
charged it to AARP members. The amount sought in the suit is the
premium difference between the Pru plan and a less-comprehensive
version that doesn't fill the gap between Medicare payments and MD
fees, plus punitive damages and attorneys' fees.
The insurer says the suit is "without merit." AARP is not involved,
although Archer blames it for overlooking the alleged overcharges.
Still unclear is the actual number of people and dollars at stake.
That information will be determined during the discovery stage of
the suit.

Medicare to Add Procedures To Bundled Payment Pilot


HCFA plans to expand its Medicare bundled payment
"centers-of-excellence" demonstration in the next two months by
adding several orthopedic and four cardiology procedures.
The HCFA has already tested the program on bypass and cataract
surgery, but those demos are expiring this year.
Under the upcoming cardiology pilot, the agency will pay facilities
a negotiated bundled rate to cover hospital and physician services
for heart bypasses, angioplasties, valve replacements and
catheterization. The orthopedic demo will cover total hip and knee
joint replacements.
Hospitals can participate in either the cardiology or the
orthopedic demo, or both. The bundled payment will account for
outlier cases; separate payments won't be made for particularly
expensive patients.
HCFA hasn't decided on the number of sites, but most likely will
choose facilities in a region comprised of several contiguous
states. HCFA plans to select hospitals by late 1996 and have the
first sites operating by the spring of 1997.

Statewide Payment Areas For Medicare Docs Eyed


HCFA is considering moving to additional statewide payment areas
for the Medicare physician fee schedule in 1997 - a move that would
pay rural doctors higher fees, comparable to those of their city
brethren. Insiders say action appears imminent.
If HCFA proposes such a change in its annual fee update this
summer, "it will become a hot issue" for docs, says Randy Teach,
director of the Washington office of the Medical Group Management
Assn. Such a proposal would create winner and loser states, a
situation that could cause Congress to jump in and legislate a
solution.
Currently, the national fee schedule contains 210 geographic
payment areas, based on the locales Medicare claims processors used
under the old charge-based payment system. The Physician Payment
Review Commission (PPRC), which advises Congress on Medicare
physician payments, recommends revamping payment areas and creating
35 statewide fee schedules; the other 15 states should have
multiple schedules based on metropolitan areas.
HCFA may be listening. In the past, the agency claimed it didn't
have the authority to redefine payment areas across the board,
although it allowed a handful of states to establish statewide fee
schedules if widely supported by physicians.
But the agency recently decided it has such authority, and is
analyzing a just-completed study by Health Economics Research that
urges retaining current payment divisions only in areas where
medical prices are much higher than the state average. The finding:
Only 14 states would retain multiple fee schedules. G

Feds Seeks Recoupment Of Provider Device Fraud


The providers who allegedly billed Medicare for  experimental
medical devices knowing it was illegal were undaunted by the threat
of government retaliation, a Senate panel was told this month.
A former device industry executive, suing providers on behalf of
the government under the whistleblower provision of the False
Claims Act, told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations that some providers risked patients' lives, tampered
with files, and lied on forms to ensure Medicare payment.
The lawsuit claims providers improperly billed Medicare for
experimental devices and related care. HCFA began officially
covering such devices last fall.
Hospital lawyers contend the whistleblower is not the originator of
the allegations - a key requirement to win such cases. The feds
denied encouraging the whistleblower to sue.
Meanwhile, some hospitals are starting to get letters from the
government demanding records of Medicare claims for experimental
devices and related medical care to figure out how much hospitals
owe Medicare, sources say.
And in a new revelation, every hospital scrutinized by the feds for
improper Medicare claims for experimental medical devices allegedly
submitted these claims, at least half knew the claims were
inappropriate, and almost 30 hospitals tried to cover it up, HHS
Deputy Inspector General Jack Hartwig told the Senate panel.
In response, he said the IG and HCFA are calculating overpayments
to providers and plan to seek repayment; evidence of alleged
criminal conduct will be investigated; fraud that has been
identified is being addressed by the Justice Department; and HHS is
addressing weaknesses in accounting and tracking of investigational
devices, in hospital oversight, and in obtaining informed patient
consent. Physicians also are being probed.

INSIDE THE BELTWAY


        Some seniors join Medicare HMOs to
retain employer-provided health benefits, according to a GAO report
(GAO/HEHS-96-63). HMOs tend to join Medicare where HMO market
penetration is well-established and capitation payments are high,
notes GAO. Call (202) 512-6000.

        HCFA has slapped intermediate
sanctions on Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts for
"knowingly" supplying misleading marketing information in its
Medicare HMO application. In freezing the HMO's Medicare enrollment
and marketing functions, HCFA levied its first intermediate
sanction on an HMO. Before sanction rules were issued in 1994,
HCFA's only recourse was to yank an HMO's contract.

        HHS awarded $2.5 million in grants
for childrens' emergency medical services. Call (301) 594-1364.

        Medicaid recipients reported bad
health more frequently in 1995 than the prior year, used hospital
rooms twice as often as other groups, and were at least twice as
likely than those with private insurance to have hypertension,
cancer, migraines, emphysema, diabetes and heart failure, reports
the National Health Survey. Call (610) 366-1310.

        Physicians, optometrists,
psychiatrists, labs and durable medical equipment suppliers engaged
in Medicare nursing home billing fraud on a "frequent and
widespread" basis, says a new GAO report (GAO/HEHS-96-18).
Unscrupulous providers often operate their schemes in volume,
inappropriately receive beneficiary information from nursing homes,
and are not flagged by Medicare's automated systems.

        Postpartum programs should include
stabilization in the birth location, home visits and registered
nurse case management, says the American Nurses Assn. Congress may

Pennsylvania to Mandate 438,000 Into Medicaid Managed
Care


Pennsylvania this month announced plans to mandate 438,000 Medicaid
recipients into HMOs in a five-county area around Philadelphia.
The initiative, dubbed "HealthChoices," is the first step of a
statewide mandatory program to be phased in over the next three
years. The state has operated a limited mandatory managed care
program for 100,000 Philadelphia-area Medicaid recipients since
1986.
Pennsylvania received a Sec. 1915(b) Medicaid waiver from HHS to
implement "HealthChoices" in 1993 under then-Gov. Robert Casey (D).
But the plan was criticized by some groups for lacking Medicaid HMO
regulations, and its implementation was delayed. A class-action
lawsuit was filed and is still pending.
Incoming Gov. Tom Ridge (R) made a number of changes to
HealthChoices before the state issued a draft request for proposals
(RFP) this month.
HMO bids will be awarded in the summer, open enrollment will begin
Aug. 6, and the program will become operational Nov. 1.
Enrollment will be phased in, with certain groups such as AFDC
recipients joining Nov. 1; remaining eligibles will be folded in on
July 1, 1997. Medicaid recipients targeted for 1997 entry may
voluntarily join HMOs sooner.
Recipients who don't select an HMO within a certain time period
will be randomly assigned one.

Changes Made to Address Criticisms

To address a number of criticisms lobbed at the initial
HealthChoices proposal, the department will:

o       Ban HMO direct marketing, such as
door-to-door solicitation, and instead have a benefits consultant
conduct enrollment activities.
o       Carve out behavioral health services
for a separate procurement process. County governments will be
given the first rights of refusal to manage mental health-substance
abuse treatment benefits before a private capitated contractor is
picked.
o       Require HMOs to submit encounter
data and comply with Medicaid HEDIS (WHW 2/5/96, p. 2).
o       Capitate HMOs, build in an allowable
profit margin, and link performance and outcome measures to profit
levels. This addresses concerns raised about the Philadelphia

Medicaid program, whose private contractor was found by the HHS
Inspector General to have made excessive profits. That contract and
program terminates Oct. 31.

o       Make direct payments to hospitals
for disproportionate share and graduate medical education, instead
of including them in HMO capitation payments.

Arkansas Hospitals, State Agree on Medicaid Payment Hikes


Arkansas hospitals and state officials recently sidestepped a
potential Medicaid payment lawsuit by  negotiating an $11
million-$12 million payment hike that will take effect April 1,
pending HCFA's expected approval.
At the heart of the three-part deal negotiated last month is a 16%
increase in the maximum amount Medicaid pays per day for inpatient
services. The increase adds up to a $5 million hike for hospitals.
The per-diem cap has been $584 since 1991, but after the Arkansas
Hospital Assn. argued that 25% of its members' costs were above
that level, the Department of Human Services agreed to raise the
cap to $675.
Second, the agreement would reduce Medicaid hospital copayments,
which in most instances are unpaid by recipients and absorbed by
hospitals. The copayment is currently 50% of hospital costs for the
first inpatient day, but that would be lowered to 10% of each
inpatient day.
Because the average Medicaid hospital length of stay in Arkansas is
under four days, state hospitals stand to gain $6 million from the
reduction in copays. That new policy also contains an economic
incentive for hospitals to reduce inpatient stays, notes James
Teeter, president of the state hospital association.
The third part of the deal is an increase in the Medicaid payment
to hospitals for patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.
Currently, Medicaid contributes the difference between the Medicare
deductible, which is $736, and 50% of the Medicaid hospital per-day
payment. The new Medicaid contribution would be the Medicare
deductible minus only 10% of the Medicaid per diem.
HCFA hasn't yet received the Arkansas Medicaid proposal, but
Teeter, who says the hospitals would sue the state otherwise, is
confident the payment hike will be approved. Arkansas Medicaid
officials, state legislators and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (D) are all
behind the deal.

Louisiana to Require Copayments To Help in Medicaid
Shortfall


Louisiana this month proposed requiring Medicaid recipients to make
nominal copayments for all health care services to help offset a
state budget crunch.
The copayments are expected to generate $21 million annually, in
addition to $10 million currently collected in prescription drug
copayments. Louisiana's Medicaid program is projecting a $450
million shortfall this fiscal year, which ends June 30, and a $330
million shortage in the following fiscal year, says David Hood,
undersecretary of the Department of Health and Hospitals.
More than half the states have adopted cost sharing in their
Medicaid programs, sources say. Louisiana is still looking at other
cuts and savings to balance the Medicaid program budget.
The proposed copays are subject to a two-week public comment period
that began Feb. 13. State officials will make changes after that
and finalize the copayment schedule, effective May 1.
As proposed, Louisiana Medicaid recipients would begin making
sliding-scale copayments, based on ability to pay. Copays would be
$0.50 to $3 for physician office visits, labs and X-ray services;
$25 for inpatient hospital admissions; 5% coinsurance for
ambulatory surgery; and $2 for alcohol and drug abuse treatment.
Children and categorically needy HMO enrollees would be exempt from
copayments. In addition, copays would not be required for
pregnancy, emergency, hospice, family planning and nursing home
services. Thus, about 50% of the state's Medicaid population would
be exempt.
Following the lead of other states, the program will let providers
decide how to collect the copayments.

In addition to the copays, the state is addressing the Medicaid
budget crunch by:

o       Reopening prior-year cost reports
for state hospitals. The department found additional allowable
costs that state hospitals are due from Medicaid, and will get
additional federal matching federal funds for that purpose. While
this move will only provide "one-time" funds, that amount will be
sufficient to solve all but $38 million to $40 million of this
year's shortfall, according to Hood.
o       Looking at changing the way nursing
homes are reimbursed by Medicaid, a move that could save anywhere
from $45 million to $105 million in fiscal 1997, Hood says.
o       Collecting about $25 million in
overpayments to psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and other
types of providers.

The state Medicaid program is looking at piloting a managed care
program and a separate voucher system on a regional basis for the
upcoming fiscal year, but won't move to a statewide managed care
system anytime soon, Hood adds.

Arizona Eyes Waiver to Integrate Medicare, Medicaid
Services


Arizona, the first state to develop a statewide capitated managed
care system that combines Medicaid acute and long-term care
services, is preparing to amend its existing Sec. 1115 waiver to
fully integrate Medicare and Medicaid services.
The state began its Medicaid managed care program in 1982 and added
the long-term care component in 1988. The program provides
institutional, residential and in-home services to elderly and
disabled Medicaid recipients who would normally be put in a nursing
home. Arizona contracts with counties and HMOs for the managed care
program.
As of Oct. 1, 1995, the program served 20,919 recipients. Nearly
half of those were elderly. About 97% of the Medicaid elderly
members in the long-term care program are "dual eligibles," who
also are covered by Medicare.
But coordination with Medicare services and linkages between acute
and long-term care have been hindered by conflicts between Medicare
and Medicaid regulations, says a new report by the National Academy
for State Health Policy.
Although the majority of elderly enrollees are dual eligibles and
receive Medicare services separately, some Medicaid long-term care
program contractors are also Medicare HMOs. If the long-term care
system contractor isn't a Medicare HMO, the contractor must
coordinate care with Medicare providers, the academy notes.
The state hopes HCFA approval of the waiver request will allow
integration of Medicare and Medicaid, and full integration of
acute, behavioral health and long-term care.
Arizona's capitation payment structure has created incentives for
program contractors to serve enrollees in their own homes or in
residential settings, the national academy notes.
As a result of the long-term care program's success, the
HCFA-imposed cap on the number of members who can receive home and
community-based services has been increased from 5% when the
program first began to 40% in 1995, says the academy.

Care System, call (207) 874-6524.

Maryland Hospital Cuts OK'd After Record Profits Reported


Determining that hospitals in Maryland enjoyed record profits last
year, state officials recently decided to pare back hospitals'
revenue stream in an attempt to pass on savings to patients.
Maryland is one of two states that set hospital rates for both
public and private payers.
Hospital net profits increased 93% in the state last year, from
$145.5 million in 1994 to $281.3 million in 1995, according to the
Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission, which regulates
hospital rates. As a percentage of total revenue, net profits went
from around 3.4% to 6.2%, says the commission.
While those rewards "can be attributed, in no small way," to
increased efficiency, the numbers also suggest that the state
rate-setting system "may simply be too generous" to hospitals, says
Commission Chair Charles Fisher.
As a result, the panel engaged in what executive director Robert
Murray called a "contentious" negotiating session with hospitals
and approved a $170.5 million cut in the projected rate increase.
In other words, while hospitals had been scheduled to get a 6.5%
rate increase in April, that bump will instead be around 4.4%. Last
year the commission made a similar 1.4 percentage point baseline
reduction.

Among other commission findings:

o       Hospital costs grew 1.63% in 1995,
below the national average of 1.75%. It's the 19th straight year
Maryland hospitals have outperformed the country in holding down
costs.
o       Hospital charges per case, the
actual bill paid by patients and carriers, increased 3%.
o       The amount of uncompensated care
increased 2.1% to $404.4 million. As a percent of revenue,
uncompensated care costs fell to 8% from 8.22%.

Mass. Providers Claim Vendor Owes Millions; State to
Intervene


Massachusetts mental health providers are prepared to sue the
state's Medicaid managed mental health contractor for $6 million to
$9 million in allegedly unpaid claims unless the providers' demands
are met. The state has promised to help the providers.
The providers, who may sue Mental Health Management of America for
breach of contract, say the vendor trapped them in a "Catch 22" to
avoid paying claims for mental health and substance abuse
treatment. The contractor required preauthorization numbers on
claims and required claims to be submitted within 90 days of
service, then allegedly didn't furnish the preauthorization numbers
promptly enough for providers to meet the 90-day deadline.
"Claims processing was not [Mental Health Management's] strength,"
admits Bruce Bullen, commissioner of the state Division for Medical
Assistance, which oversees Medicaid.
"We'll work this through with providers," he says. "We'll make sure
[the firm] is responsible for complying with the contract. But it
doesn't mean we'll pay all claims."
Bullen noted that Mental Health Management "performed in a superior
fashion in some areas, like quality management."
Nevertheless, Massachusetts didn't renew Mental Health Management's
Medicaid managed care contract. Mental Health Management, owned by
First Financial Management Corp. of Atlanta, got the Massachusetts
Medicaid contract for managed behavioral health care in 1992.
John Kahn, a lawyer representing Mental Health Corp. of
Massachusetts, an organization of 65 mental health agencies
allegedly owed money, asked the contractor to process the
providers' unpaid claims, and suspend requirements related to prior
approval, billing within 90 days, a 365-day payment appeals process
and claims identification numbers.
Kahn says Mental Health Management will meet with the providers
next week on the dispute.
Mental Health Management broke new ground in providing this type of
comprehensive managed mental health care to Medicaid, so naturally
there were growing pains, says Ron Preston, HCFA's associate
regional administrator.
But that's not why the firm's contract wasn't renewed, he
maintains. "Other applicants had more solid applications," Preston
says.
State officials say providers fear Mental Health Management will
disappear without making good on claims owed. "We want to make sure
they do everything in compliance," since the contract will be
closed out in June, says Bullen, whose agency is auditing the
company.
The Medicaid behavioral health vendor was unavailable for comment.
Mental Health Management was paid $11.5 million in administrative
expenses under the Medicaid risk-bearing contract.

STATE BRIEFS


        Ten states enacted laws governing
the administration and financing of child mental health services in
1995, and 15 passed laws governing treatment, says the National
Conference of State Legislatures. For example, New Mexico
eliminated restrictions on behavior modification, Tennessee banned
release of childrens' mental health records to persons accused of
child abuse or neglect, and Missouri required school districts to
educate children placed by mental health or social service
agencies. For details on "Children, Youth and Family Issues," call
(202) 624-5400.

        D.C. Mayor Marion Barry (D) proposed
an 11% Medicaid funding cut in his fiscal 1997 budget. The district
plans to expand its use of managed care. 

        Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton (D)
proposed to phase out the state's tax on physicians. The tax is
part of the 1994 health reform statute, which some lawmakers want
to pare back this session. 

        Low-income Wisconsin residents would
receive health care coverage if they needed it while moving off of
welfare into the workforce, according to reforms proposed by Gov.
Tommy Thompson (R). The state is scheduled to replace the AFDC
welfare program with a work-based system in 1999.

        Alaska, Pennsylvania and Louisiana
could pass provider-supported medical malpractice legislation this
year, according to the American Tort Reform Assn. Meanwhile,
medical liability changes could be rolled back in New Jersey,
Florida, Rhode Island and Utah. Call (202) 682-1022.

        California Medicaid HMOs vary from
plan to plan in the amount of physician services they offer,
according to a recent report by the Center for Health Care Rights.
For example, Universal Care HMO averages 0.37 physician encounters
a year per Medicaid patient, compared with 5.14 at Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan's HMO in southern California. Call (213)
383-4519.

        Hospital spending for acute
myocardial infarction in states with medical malpractice laws, such
as non-economic damage award caps, grew 17% between 1984 and 1990,
compared with 24% in states without such laws, according to
Stanford University economists Daniel Kessler and Mark McClellan.
For ischemic heart disease, spending growth was 17% in states with
medical liability changes and 28% in states without such laws. Call
(415) 723-9193.
