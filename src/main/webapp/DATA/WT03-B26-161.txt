<H4>4. BRINGING PRODUCERS AND USERS TOGETHER</H4>
<BR>
In order to bring about these standards, it is important that Australia
work closely with any moves or existing progress in these directions in
the international community. However, there is a need for Australian users
and data or value added product producers to get together and define what
the needs of Australian users are - whatever the progress or lack of progress
internationally. In the case of Land AVHRR Data I think the need is critical.
This Workshop is an ideal place to start the process as there are researchers,
data providers, value adders and some end users all meeting together to
discuss the issues facing the 'industry'. Let's not waste the opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
In any transaction of the kind we are discussing, involving a producer and
a user, there are two risks that must be minimised or at least balanced
if the transaction is to be fair and even for it to keep occurring. These
are the &quot;Producer's Risk&quot; and the &quot;User's Risk&quot;. They
assume there is a measure of quality available for the product and a strategy
of testing. In this case, the producers risk is the probability that a perfectly
good product will be rejected as poor and the consumer's risk is the probability
that a product called acceptable is poor. Clearly, standards, measures and
strategies of testing must all be developed by users and producers together
to create a situation everyone can live with. In practice, the financial
viability of a product to the producers may be an important component in
the definition of a standard.<BR>
<BR>
In our area of AVHRR data and products there are two forums for standards.
These are the interface between data producers and data users (or value
adders) and the interface between value adders and the end users. In the
end, the two will form part of the same 'sentence' and need to be compatible:
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
&quot;With data produced at certified Level x, using processing methods
outlined in manual y, with staff and infrastructure of capability z it is
possible to produce specified product p with accuracy q.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Perhaps this Workshop, with its useful blend of researchers, data managers,
data suppliers, value adders and users, can outline the cases where Australian
users can fill in the gaps in sentences like this one and help define what
Level x is for the benefit of the data producers. Perhaps there is no existing
sentence of this type of which we can be confident. In either case, what
are the base standards, what can reliably and consistently be achieved and
what measures can we put into place to ensure in the future (to the benefit
of producers and users alike) that they are being met? I claim that although
the answers to these questions do not always involve scientific issues of
interest to leading edge researchers it is in their interest and essential
for their long term survival that some answers be found.<BR>
