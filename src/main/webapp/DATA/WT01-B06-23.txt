         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What types of women become
         surrogates?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. In SMI's program, a surrogate must be between 18-35
         and have previously had a child. The typical surrogate is
         28, married, employed, and solidly middle class. The single
         characteristic describing all of our surrogates is altruism.
         The women in our program are generous, caring, healthy
         women. They become surrogates to help people have families.
         Unlike other programs which look for poor women (based on
         the mistaken belief that a poor woman is less likely to keep
         the child), our surrogates are never motivated by financial
         need. Their fee, which generally is around $13,000, is a
         factor, but never the main reason for their participation.

         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What do couples look for in a
         surrogate?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. Couples base their decision on many factors. Some
         couples select a woman because of her location or physical
         similarity. Others want a surrogate who is intelligent. All
         couples, however, look for a woman who is healthy, has no
         significant medical/psychological difficulties, is
         emotionally and mentally stable, conceives easily, and who
         is responsible and mature enough to realize that the couple
         is placing an enormous amount of trust in her to carry their
         child.

         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. Is the surrogate
         screened?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. Absolutely. The surrogates go through a variety of
         different screening processes. References are checked,
         medical records from prior pregnancies are obtained, a
         criminal history check is done, and the surrogate (and her
         husband if married) are then given a complete psychological
         exam. The couple gets a copy of the psyc report, and they
         make a final decision if the surrogate is acceptable.
         Approximately 1% - 2% of all women who initially contact SMI
         actually end up being accepted into the program.
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"> </FONT></B>
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What happens if the surrogate
         refuses to give up the child?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. Of the 2000 or so births to surrogates in the country,
         a woman has refused to relinquish the child less than 1% of
         the time. SMI has never had this happen. In every case where
         it has, the surrogate either was not screened at all, or the
         couple was not made aware of the psychological findings.
         When surrogacy is done right, it works.
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"> </FONT></B>
         
         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. What are the success
         rates?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. "Success" should only mean one thing: the percentage
         of couples/individuals who actually end up with a child. In
         the AI program, your success rate depends on the male's
         sperm count and the surrogate's ability to conceive. 85% of
         all of SMI's clients in the AI program end up with a child.
         On the average, it takes our surrogates 3 cycles to
         conceive. Some take longer. Many get pregnant on the first
         try. In the IVF/ET program, the success rates are much
         lower, primarily because the wives of the couples are much
         older. In that program, the success rate is about 20%-25%.
         SMI will work with you as long as you wish. There are
         additional legal fees if you switch surrogates.

         <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Q. Will the couple and the
         surrogate meet?</FONT></B>
         
         <P>A. SMI encourages "open surrogacy." The reason for this
         is simple: because our surrogates are not doing this for the
         money, they want (and have every right) to know the types of
         people for whom they are doing this. Meeting the surrogate
         allows both sides to make sure that the arrangement will
         work. Most of our couples stay in contact with their
         surrogate frequently during the pregnancy. Even after the
         birth, many couples still stay in touch with their
         surrogates (X-mas cards, birthday cards, etc.), although for
         most couples and surrogates the relationship ends after the
         baby is born.
