 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS </H2>

 <P>  Until recent years, the primary role of vitamins and minerals was considered to be as organic molecules essential for normal metabolism and maintenance of tissues, and for preventing the well know deficiency diseases such as scurvy beriberi, pellagra and others.</P>
<P>  We now know that many of the vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A, E and C in the form of    Beta-Carotene, Selenium, Germaniurn, Vanadium and others have additional other important functions as well. They work as antioxidants or free radical scavengers.</P>
<P>  Scientists have found that vitamins A, C and E prevent certain types of cancer by blocking the formation of cancer causing substances in the body. Researchers are using these vitamins to prevent nitrates from turning into nitrosamines, one of the most researched and most recognized cancer causing substances today. Nitrites and nitrates routinely are found in processed, packaged meats, in the water we drink and even in cigarette smoke. It is now known that second-hand cigarette smoke is even more dangerous than if you had been smoking.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BETA-CAROTENE</H2>
<P>   Vitamin A and its precursor, Beta-Carotene, which exists in carrots, spinach and other vegetables fight the cancer causing effects of cigarette smoke.  In several studies it has been demonstrated that people who smoke stand a lower risk of developing lung cancer if they have diets high in vitamin A (BetaCarotene) containing foods. Beta-Carotene is not only a valuable antioxidant, but like vitamins C and E, it is an important nutrient in maintaining the immune system.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN C</H2>
<P>  Thousands of articles have been written about the beneficial effects of vitamin C on health, especially in regard to the immune system and its antioxidant effect. It has been proven that vitamin C protects against the harmful effects of cigarette smoke and environmental pollution  such as automobile exhaust, industrial chemicals, bacterial toxins and other free radical causing agents.</P>
<P>  Like Beta-Carotene, vitamin C is very capable of protecting against nitrosamines.  These substances are produced in the stomach from nitrates and nitrites in such foods as hot dogs, bacon, luncheon meat and smoked fish. Many rural wells contain nitrates that have entered underground water supplies from the run off` of fertilizers and herbicides that have been applied to our agricultural lands.</P>

<P>  Next to Beta-Carotene and vitamin C, vitamin E has probably received the most attention.  Doctors Wilfrid and Evan Shute first showed years ago that vitamin E saved lives.  Vitamin E is classified as an antioxidant which protects our bodies when they are exposed to environmental pollutants that interfere with healthy oxygen metabolism.  It helps "preserve oxygen." Vitamin E is also known to be of special importance to the heart and reproductive organs in our bodies as well.</P>
 <P>  Because of industrial and automotive pollution, major cities can be hazardous to your health.  The FDA has determined that the toxicity of the ozone is comparable to phosgene, used in gas war-fare, and that .05 parts per million of ozone is dangerous.  Vitamin E blocks the damaging oxidation of healthy cells by this ozone and is therefore a natural defense.</P>
<P>  You may ask why Life Plus has PROTX II as a product when vitamin C, vitamin E and Beta-Carotene are in other products. Quite simply, it can be important to take more of these valuable antioxidants than ever before, as the need for them is growing every day. PROTX II is a convenient, single source of these valuable nutrients and a simple way to ensure you receive reasonable amounts every day. PROTX II is part of the Life Plus answer to living in the 20th century.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PROTX II</H2>
<P>   Most individuals take one tablet twice a day with their multiple vitamin and mineral. Usually, this is adequate. If  you  are  experiencing  unusual  environmental conditions or a stressful lifestyle, more tablets can be taken.</P>
