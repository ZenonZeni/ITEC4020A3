<H1> NEW DATA ON RADIOACTIVE RELEASE </H1>
<HR>
     The well known <A HREF = "frelleg.gif">picture of dynamics of radionuclide release</A> at 
the Chernobyl accident is the basis for majority of  model 
calculations. In this section the authors would  like  to  present 
the data on radionuclide  composition  of  the  release  from  the 
reactor ruins during two months after the accident, which have not 
been analyzed earlier and considerably  compliment  and  partially 
change the generally accepted picture of the release. 
<P> 
     The aerosol samples for  gamma  spectrometric  analysis  were 
obtained by means of filter  cars  towed  by  <A HREF = "helabove.html">helicopters  of  air 
forces</A> at flights directly over the reactor ruins.  In  the  main, 
the sampling was made at the heights from 300 to 700  m,  and  the 
volume of the air pumped for the samples was several thousands  of 
cubic meters. The data of  gamma  spectrometric  analysis  of  the 
samples are presented  in the form  of  charts  of  volume 
activity.  
<P> 
<IMG SRC  = "frelease.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE>Release of Nuclide. Measurements above reactor.
<P> 
     The data were obtained systematically beginning from  27 
April 1986 and till the end of  June  (one,  more  rarely  several 
measurements per day), but they are insufficient  for  application 
of standard mathematical methods for estimation  of  significance. 
More fine time structure of release intensity than it is shown  in 
the generally <A HREF = "frelleg.gif">accepted model</A>  attracts attention. 
<P> 
     Another new result is the conclusion about  the  presence  of 
high-power radionuclide releases outside the limits  of  ten  days 
after 26 April, whereas the active stage terminates in ten days in 
the generally  accepted  model  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>.  For  instance,  there  is a 
peak in 20-21 days after the beginning of the accident, and a less 
pronounced peak in the region of 25-30 days. 
<P> 
     The estimation of significance of new data was  performed  in 
several ways. At first they were checked  by  comparing  with  the 
results  of  independent  sufficiently  reliable  measurements  of 
radionuclide activity in the air of <B>Kiev</B> and <B>Vilnus</B>.  There  is  a 
considerable set of estimated data on measurements  of  <A HREF = "ikiev.gif">iodine-131 
concentration in the air of Kiev</A> ( 140 km to the  south  from  the 
Chernobyl NPP) during May-June 1986 <A HREF = "sources.html#8">[8]</A>. If we match  the 
data on iodine-131 concentration over the ruins 
in  the  same  time  scale,  then  one  can  see  noticeable  time 
correlation in activity peaks even without attraction  of  weather 
data and transport models. 
<P> 
     The analysis of the measurement data  of  <cs-vil.gif">Ru-103  and  Cs-137 
</A>activity over the reactor and  in the air of the near-ground layer 
in Vilnus <A HREF = "sources.html#7">[7]</A> and in Berezino biosphere reserve <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A>  also  showed 
time correlations with the shift of 1-2 days  noticeable  increase 
of activity on 16-20 May is seen in  all  charts.  The  book  <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A> 
indicates that "the measurements at large distances  indicate  the 
release of radioactive products (mainly of Cs-137) continuing up to 
25 May 1986, which was obviously attributed to new local  releases 
from the mostly heated zones of the reactor." 
<P> 
     Correlations  and  ratios  of  activities  of  characteristic 
radio nuclides in samples served from the very beginning  as  basic 
bench marks both for identification of the samples proper, and for 
reconstruction  of  the  values  measured  more  difficulty,  for 
instance, of the levels of plutonium isotopes. It  is  interesting 
to consider correlations for cesium-134 and  cesium-137  isotopes, 
which should vary in  rather  narrow  limits,  if  the  considered 
measurements were performed correctly. The range of the values  of 
the ratio    Cs134/Cs137 for fuel assemblies with different level  of 
burn-up at the moment  of the accident varied from 0.4 to 0.7 with 
the average 0.52-0.54.  
<P> 
<IMG SRC  = "cscs.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
<P> 
This picture presents these ratios obtained  from 
the results of measurements of wair samples over the  reactor,  and 
the difference of the values is whithin - 15%. 
<P> 
<IMG SRC  = "zrnb.gif">
<P> 
     It is  revealing  that  the  ratio  of   Nb-95  and  Zr-95 
activities, which  are  rather  close  in  physical  and  chemical 
properties, remains constant, at least within 30%.  The 
ratio of activities of these radio nuclides  with  Ce-144  is  also 
stable. The dynamic picture of the  release  of  these  relatively 
refractory radionuclides strongly connected with the  fuel  matrix 
is quite homogeneous, and in the whole repeats the picture of <A HREF = "frelease.gif">full release</A> for volatile radio nuclides. As for the ratio  of  plutonium  and 
Ce-144 activities in samples of air and soil, which was the  basis 
for reconstruction  of  the  amount  of  released  plutonium  and, 
consequently, or fuel, in the initial period  on  all  samples  it 
slightly differed from the average value equal to (9.4+0.8).10  . 
<P> 
     There are interesting data iodine form of release that was  
collected by <A HREF = "#table1">Phys.-Chem. Institute</A> above reactor and in Vilnus.
