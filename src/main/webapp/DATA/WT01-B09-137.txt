<B>Project Title:  Consumer Demographics<p>

Performing Organization: PSI Energy, Indianapolis Power & Light</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: Madelyn Harwood, PSI Energy, (317) 838­1518<br>
Jim Wittman, IPL, (317) 261­8214</P> 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P><P>Project objective is to determine baseline attitudes and perceptions of 
electric vehicles. Electricore commissioned a survey of people living in the Indianapolis Power and Light, Public
Service Indiana, Southern Indiana Gas and Electric, Northern Indiana Public Service Company, and
Indiana­Michigan Power service areas, Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Cincinnati, Ohio. </P>

<P>The results of the study of consumer attitudes showed that over half of those surveyed considered themselves
familiar with electric cars, and almost half said they would consider purchasing an electric vehicle. The study,
which consisted of telephone surveys and the interviewing of focus groups, was concluded in November 1994. </P>

<P>When asked how likely they were to consider purchasing an electric vehicle, 10 percent of those surveyed stated
they would be very likely to do so, while another 36 percent said they would be somewhat likely. Very unlikely was
the choice of 29 percent of the respondents. "Among those whose attitude was unlikely, the reasons centered
upon their development and familiarity," the report continued. "A total of 31 percent of the unlikely segment stated
they will wait until the technology is perfected with an additional 14 percent stating they simply were not familiar
enough with the cars at this time." Respondents cited the perceived range and speed of electric cars as a
negative, according to the report, adding that those with a negative attitude toward an electric car purchase were
"style or performance consumers." Other barriers in the consideration of an electric car were income and single
car households. </P>
<P>
Among the report's findings: </P>
<ul>
<P><li>23 percent of respondents in IPL's service area, and 25 percent in PSI's service area, were either aware of
     EV usage in their area or had seen or used an EV. Fifty­four percent of those surveyed in Chattanooga
     made the same claim. (Chattanooga is using electric busses as part of its public transportation system.) 
     The survey showed that the group most interested in an electric vehicle were better educated males with
     middle­income white collar jobs. </P>
<P><li>Likelihood of purchasing an EV or interest in an EV varies directly with familiarity, 
     according to the report, pointing out that more than twice as many of those who are very familiar with
     electric cars are very likely to consider them. This would seem to suggest that building familiarity and
     interest go hand in hand. </P>
<P><li>The report recommended that electric cars should be positioned as an alternative vehicle and not as a direct
     competitor to internal combustion vehicles. It also concluded that advertising and demonstrations of electric
     vehicles should be used to increase the public's familiarity with EVs.</P>
</ul>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>Electric Vehicle Attitudes Research Report Study</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P>Although a follow up study is scheduled for this fall, the requirements of this project and
original objectives have been met. Project completed.</P>
