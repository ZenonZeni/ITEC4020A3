<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Large-volume industrial chemicals and materials are generally synthesized from fossil fuels.  Other potential commercial feedstocks include resources from renewable and agricultural processes.  However, these resources are not widely used because of the lack of cost-effective technologies for manufacturing high-volume chemical building blocks from these materials.  America's agricultural industry could be revitalized by expanding market demand for farm and forestry products, while the chemical industry would benefit from less costly feedstocks.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory is participating in a consortium of five national laboratories.  The goal is to use resources from renewable and agricultural processes as feedstocks to demonstrate new pathways to production of chemicals (such as succinic acid, the first target of Argonne's program).  Argonne is applying metabolic engineering to develop superior organisms that improve product yield, productivity, and tolerance.  Electrodialysis techniques are being applied to product recovery, and a novel process is being developed to produce low-cost, high-purity intermediates suitable for further conversion.  Argonne is also developing new, degradable polyester derivatives, which could increase the succinic acid market significantly.
<P>
Currently, succinic acid is produced by using a hydrocarbon-based process that oxidizes n-butane to maleic anhydride.  The maleic anhydride is then hydrated to the acid form and hydrogenated to yield succinic acid.  A fermentation process using glucose derived from corn syrup can also produce succinic acid, but it is not economically competitive.  Argonne is improving fermentation efficiency by using conventional and genetic techniques to develop superior succinic-acid-producing organisms.
<P>
Conventional technology for primary purification involves addition of sulfuric acid to the fermentation broth, which contains calcium succinate.  This step generates large volumes of calcium sulfate salt waste, which poses a serious waste management problem for industrial-scale processes.  Other, newer technologies also generate different kinds of waste salts.  In contrast, Argonne's primary purification process uses advanced desalting and water-splitting electrodialysis technologies.  These technologies purify the succinic acid efficiently and economically without generating the large volumes of salt waste streams.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
The feasibility of electrodialysis for primary purification of succinic acid has been demonstrated by using fermentation broths.  Economic analysis shows that this process should reduce the overall succinic-acid production cost by about 6¢/lb, compared with conventional methods.  The feasibility of a novel secondary purification process is being studied.  Genetic analysis of the succinic-acid pathways has generated metabolic engineering approaches for biocatalyst development.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
For succinic acid production, Argonne will continue development efforts and participate in a demonstration of an integrated process for converting carbohydrates to succinic acid to 1,4-butanediol.  The demonstration is planned to start in late 1995, and the integrated process will be operated continuously for a period long enough to test critical parameters in the fermentation, recovery, and catalytic conversion processes.  Additional products (such as butanol) will be studied during 1995.  Argonne will contribute its technical expertise in biocatalyst development and product recovery.
