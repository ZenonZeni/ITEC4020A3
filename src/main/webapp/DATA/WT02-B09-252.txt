<H4><u>Counselling (Emotional Health)</u></H4>
Being emotionally (mentally) healthy means feeling reasonably good about yourself and others. 
It does not mean feeling good all the time. No one does. Everyone has strong feelings, 
particularly about the emotional issues facing them. You are not alone.
If bad feelings begin to interfere with your mental health and normal activities, 
they may be warning signs of emotional problems.
<p>
These warning signs include:
<ul>
<li>trouble dealing with parents or family
<li>sudden, extreme changes in mood or behaviour
<li>depression, prolonged unhappiness,withdrawal from friends and activities,and lack of 
interest
<li>feelings of uneasiness, fear or imagined danger
<li>jumpiness, irritability	
<li>increased physical health concerns
<li>not working up to potential in school or sports
<li>trouble sleeping/lack of appetite
</ul>
<p>
Emotional problems are not hopeless or incurable. An emotionally troubled person can get help.
COUNSELLING is a confidential opportunity to discuss personal issues with someone you can trust. 
You explain to a counsellor how you are feeling and why you think you are feeling that way. In 
the process of explaining those feelings, you can learn how to understand yourself better and 
how to make more knowledgeable decisions about your life.
<p>
Sometimes friends and relatives who are good listeners can help you make decisions. Trust your 
feelings and find someone who makes you feel comfortable.
If your problems seem too difficult or too personal to discuss with a friend or relative, then 
you may need to find a trained counsellor.
<p>
Mental health centres and other agencies provide counselling on issues such as:
<ul>
<li>loneliness
<li>difficulty with making friends
<li>drug or alcohol misuse/abuse
<li>sexuality
<li>peer pressure
<li>depression and anxiety
<li>confused thoughts, reality testing
<li>family problems
</ul>
<p>
Some agencies allow counsellors to see a teenager without parental permission. Call first to 
determine policies. Ask about special services for teens, fees and appointment times. Remember, 
don't let anything keep you from getting the help you deserve. For assistance in locating 
COUNSELLING, please call:<ul><li>your own family doctor<li>your school counsellor or community health nurse</ul>
