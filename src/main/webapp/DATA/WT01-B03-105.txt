<BR> TOMS RIVER, NJ - <A HREF="TGCAcji.html">Charles J. Irwin</A>,  General
Counsel of <A HREF="TGCA.html">Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators, Inc.
(TGCA)</A> announced the creation of a new educational resource for the Native
American Gaming Industry. His firm's &quot;<A HREF="TGCAAcc.html">Tribal Gaming
Academy</A>&quot; (Academy) has scheduled programs in both Atlantic City, NJ and
Palm Springs, CA within the next few months. Irwin, formerly Vice Chairman of
the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, &amp; Chairman of the Chitimacha
Tribal Gaming Commission in Louisiana, is an active consultant in the field of
Tribal Government Gaming.<BR>
<BR> Scheduled for November (Atlantic City) and January (Palm Springs) the
Academy's initial programs will focus on the needs of newly appointed Tribal
Gaming Commissioners. According to Irwin, each will focus on, &quot;developing a
basic understanding of: Tribal Gaming's changing legal climate, assessing and
managing risk in the casino environment, understanding casino games, and
regulating even complex casino operations. As time passes,&quot; adds Irwin, &quot;the
challenges of successful tribal gaming are handed to new generations of Tribal
leaders who need to quickly gain an understanding of the industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR> TGCA has been helping with that process as, consultants, since 1993. Their
services frequently include customized training programs to Tribal Council
Members, Gaming Commission Members, and/or Gaming Compliance Officers. Most of
these programs have focused on Gaming Commissions as they were being launched.
The Academy programs will focus on newly appointed Commissioners as they prepare
to join Commissions already in operation. <BR>
<BR> &quot;Modeled after a State Police Academy that meets municipal training
needs by assembling new officers from several jurisdictions,&quot; Irwin
continues, &quot;our academy will assembleTribal Leaders from several nations
for training at the same time. We have two primary goals. The first is excellent
training. The second is a better exchange of information throughout the Tribal
Gaming Industry.<BR>
<BR> Irwin served as Chairman of the Chitimacha Gaming Commission from 1993 to
1995. He was appointed to the New Jersey Casino Regulatory Commission in 1991,
and served until April of 1993. Prior to that he was a member of the Casino
Reinvestment Development Authority. He also served as a member of the New Jersey
Assembly (1968-1971), and as Director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer
Affairs (1971-1973). An attorney since 1960 Irwin has practiced before both
state and federal courts including the US Supreme Court.<BR>
