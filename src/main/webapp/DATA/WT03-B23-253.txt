<P>
The Master of Science degree in Software Systems Engineering <B>(MS-SWSE)</B>
provides specialized knowledge and experience in developing and modifying
large, complex software systems.
It emphasizes technical and management aspects of the software
engineering process.
Software systems engineering is a young and emerging
discipline based on computer analysis, design, construction, testing,
maintenance, economics, and management issues of software engineering.
A pragmatic approach to problem solving is the hallmark of
a software engineer.
Software systems engineers are concerned with the theoretical and practical
aspects of technology, cost,
and social impact of software systems that are both effective and efficient.

<P>
Software systems engineers are in demand in every segment of society
affected by computing technology.
Typical employers include companies that build and sell computers,
software companies, research and development laboratories,
aerospace contractors, banks, insurance companies,
and manufacturing organizations.
The master's program is concerned with both technical and managerial issues,
but primary emphasis is placed on the technical aspects of building and
modifying software systems.
