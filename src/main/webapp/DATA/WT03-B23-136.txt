Stocks opened up on the plus side from yesterday’s record climb as another spate of better-than-expected profits keep the bulls happy. Of the 101 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 69% of the companies have matched or beat Wall Street's estimates.
<P>
<STRONG>Ascend Communications Inc. (ASND)</STRONG> closed up 6 1/8 after the company said it earned $0.32 a share. While the report was only $0.01 higher than street consensus, the company commented that undeliverable orders were stronger than expected suggesting to some investors that last quarter’s strength will continue in 1997. ASND’s announcement gave a boost to other stocks in the group: <STRONG>Cascade Communications Corp. (CSCC)</STRONG> up 8 1/8, <STRONG>U.S. Robotics (USRX)</STRONG> up 4 1/2 and <STRONG>Xircom (XIRC)</STRONG> up 2 1/4.
<P>
Stocks stayed strong all day as the DJIA topped 6800 for the first time, closing up 67.73 to 6833.10 led by <STRONG>DuPont (DD)</STRONG> up 3 1/8, <STRONG>McDonald's Corp. (MCD)</STRONG> up 1 7/8, <STRONG>Merck & Co. (MRK)</STRONG> up 1 7/8 and <STRONG>AlliedSignal (ALD)</STRONG> up 1 5/8. The S&P 500 index closed up 6.39 to 776.14 and the Nasdaq OTC Composite index closed up 8.60 to 1349.06.
<P>
Bond and stock investors got some help this morning from a <EM>Washington Post</EM> story <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1997-01/17/026R-011797-idx.html">“Fed Holding Off On Rate Increases”</A> that says the Fed won’t lift interest rates at its next meeting in February. Higher interest rates would boost borrowing costs, crimping corporate expansion plans and weakening the economy. The article follows Fed Governor Meyers' speech yesterday which suggested an acceleration in the economy could prompt the Fed to rein in inflation and that “all paths are downhill” for the U.S. economy after last year’s performance. 
<P>
Bonds initially fell after a Fed report showing larger-than-expected industrial output last month raised concerns about the economy growing too quickly, but they managed to erase their earlier losses when a University of Michigan survey on consumer sentiment suggested that consumers were less upbeat. The benchmark 30-year government bond closed up 2 /32 to 95 28/32 with a yield of 6.82%.
<P>
<STRONG>Today’s Highlights:</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>CSX Corp. (CSX)</STRONG> closed up 1 3/4 to 46 3/4 after shareholders voted down a proposal to exempt the company from a Pennsylvania law that blocks CSX's planned $9.3 billion acquisition of <STRONG>Conrail (CRR)</STRONG>. CRR closed unchanged at 103 1/2.
<P>
<STRONG>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)</STRONG> closed up 1 1/8 to 87 1/8. The company’s total assets are about 70% cash now according to a <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> article. Some analysts believe the low yield on its cash holdings could become a drag on the overall performance and eventually its stock price. The software giant reported earnings after the close. Fiscal second-quarter earnings were $0.57 a share vs. $0.45 last year. While the report bettered the average street estimate of $0.51, the company also announced that it expects revenues to start to slowdown in July as a result of reduced revenues from maturing products and lower margins as a result of higher R&D spending and new business ventures.
<P>
<STRONG>Paine Webber Group Inc. (PWJ)</STRONG> closed up 3 3/4 to 31 1/2. <EM>Business Week</EM> reported in its “Inside Wall Street” column that an infamous “unidentified analyst” says the brokerage firm could be worth $55 a share in a buyout. The article speculated that BankAmerica was a possible suitor.
<P>
<STRONG>Perkin-Elmer Corp. (PKN)</STRONG> closed up 4 7/8 to 70 3/8 after the company said its fiscal second-quarter earnings rose to $1.15 a share from $0.53 a year ago, beating the street consensus of $0.63.
<P>
<STRONG>VLSI Technology Inc. (VLSI)</STRONG> closed down 5 7/8 to 17 3/8 after the company said it had a fourth-quarter loss of $1.38 a share. The loss included a charge of $115.6 million for the previously announced closing of its San Jose, California wafer facility. Excluding the charge, VLSI said it would have earned a profit of $0.17 a share, a penny shy of street consensus. It was odd that the shares reacted to what was basically old news, but we do know that one analyst downgraded the shares. What bothers me the most about today's decline is the unusually high volume. We'll keep you abreast on what is going on.
