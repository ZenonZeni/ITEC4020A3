<h1>Toxic Effects of Marijuana </h1>

<p><b>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Individual Toxicity</b> </p>

<p>The smoked use of cannabis is not without hazards which should
be clearly recognized so as to permit appropriate action to avoid
or minimize these untoward effects. </p>

<p><b>Physical Effects</b> </p>

<p>The smoke of cannabis is irritating to the mouth, throat,
trachea, bronchii, and lungs. The level of irritation is
comparable to that of tobacco with the level of irritation
dependent upon the amount of exposure, heat of the smoke and
degree of impurity. Because of it's illegality it is not yet
possible to scientifically document the possible connection with
actual lung disease. </p>

<p>For similar reasons it is not possible to determine possible
adverse effects upon passive exposure to marijuana smoke. </p>

<p>There are some people that are allergic to marijuana smoke and
develop hives or asthmatic symptoms when exposed to it. </p>

<p><b>Mental Effects</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis when smoked may cause confusion and disorientation in
the inexperienced or sensitive user. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Mikuriya's Credentials</b> </p>

<p>For the past twenty five years Dr. Mikuriya studied the
effects of marijuana professionally in capacities of drug abuse
treatment program director, research psychiatrist for the federal
government, visitor to endemic areas of use, general clinician
treating acute psychiatric in-patients and outpatients. </p>

<p>Politically, he was on the board of directors of the
California Marijuana Initiatives of 1972 - 74, Amorphia and an
advisor to its successor, the National Organization to Reform the
Marijuana Laws (NORML). </p>

<p>A graduate of Reed College, Mikuriya completed his medical
education at Temple University Medical School, Philadelphia. He
received his psychiatric specialty training at Oregon State
Hospital in Salem and Mendocino State Hospital in northern
California. After serving at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric
Institute at Princeton, Mikuriya was appointed first director of
marijuana research at the National Institute of Mental Health,
Chevy Chase, Maryland in 1967. Since then he has been in private
psychiatric practice in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley.
Mikuriya has published numerous papers on marijuana and is the
editor and publisher of Marijuana Medical Papers. </p>
