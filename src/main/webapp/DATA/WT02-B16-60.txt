<p><b>Welcome to the <a href="quiktour.htm">Hydrogen 
InfoNet</a></b>--created for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to 
show you how a simple and abundant element--hydrogen--can help to meet 
our nation's future needs for safe, clean, versatile forms of renewable 
energy.

<p>Liquid hydrogen is already used as a rocket fuel to lift today's space 

vehicles into orbit. 
Hydrogen is also used in the petroleum refining, chemicals, food, and 
electronics industries.
Because it is non polluting and abundant, hydrogen is being explored and 

developed as an important fuel and energy source for the future.<p> In 
the next century, many vehicles and aircraft are likely to be powered by 

hydrogen, in liquid, slush, or gaseous form. Hydrogen will also be a 
clean source of electricity for lighting, heating, and cooling our 
buildings while it helps to keep the motors of industry humming.
