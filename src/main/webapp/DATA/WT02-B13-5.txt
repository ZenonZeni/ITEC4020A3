re: April 22, 1994 Spring Workshop at UCB<BR>


<P>

The Spring Workshop brought together 16 UC faculty and graduate

students interested in Comparative Immigration and Integration

issues. CGES Director Gerald Feldman explained that the funds

that support the group are from a 10-year grant from the German

government to promote German and European studies; he stressed

the need for CIIP affiliates to acknowledge CGES in their working

papers and scholarly publications. CIIP affiliates are invited

to submit papers to Patricia LaHay, CGES, 254 Moses, UCB and,

after review by the CIIP Executive Committee, they will be issued

as CIIP Working Papers.<BR>


<P>

Dean of International Studies Dick Buxbaum noted that immigration

and integration issues provide an opportunity to do what university

leaders want to promote--interdisciplinary problem-oriented research.

Andres Jimenez of the California Policy Seminar explained that

this is exactly how the CPS is treating immigration and integration

issues in California, and that CPS may be able to provide supplemental

funds for CIIP projects.<BR>


<P>

CIIP affiliates have diverse interests. The issues being addressed

range from the apparent &quot;structural demand&quot; for immigrant

labor in industrial democracies--meaning that there is a demand

for foreign workers even during recession--to how immigrants are

being integrated in the relatively rich (parts of)countries with

nationalist movements. Several CIIP affiliates are asking how

the industrial democracies dealt with immigrants in the past,

and what lessons historical experience provide for today's debates.

<BR>


<P>

CIIP affiliates are examining the growing global importance of

the international labor market--remittances from citizens abroad

are the number one source of foreign exchange from Algeria to

the ex-Yugoslavia. Many CIIP affiliates are interested in the

transnational linkages that arise between areas of origin and

destination, and how these linkages affect the economies, politics,

and social organizations of both areas of origin and destination.

<BR>


<P>

The CIIP group agreed to hold its Fall Workshop Friday October

21, 1994. We have preliminary approval to meet at UCSD, so that

those who can arrive on Thursday October 20 can take a field trip

to the US-Mexican border. <BR>


<P>

At the Fall Workshop, the morning session will be devoted to 2

or 3 presentations by CIIP affiliates on recently-completed research

projects. A notice will be circulated in the September 1994 Migration

News asking who would like to make a 20 to 30 minute presentation

on their research; CIIP affiliates receiving support from CGES

are expected to make one presentation per year.<BR>


<P>

The afternoon session will feature a presentation on the Commission

on Immigration Reform's report, due to be released in September

1994. It is expected to guide the Clinton Administration's immigration

reform proposals.<BR>


<P>

The minutes of the Spring Workshop will be distributed by (intercampus)

mail, along with a list of the faculty and graduate students who

pariticipated in the January and April workshops, and those who

recieved CIIP research awards. Please send corrections and additions

to Patricia Lahay.<BR>
