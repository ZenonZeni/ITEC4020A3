GMS PATHFINDER SCIENCE WORKING GROUP<BR>
<BR>
Tasks</B><BR>
<BR>
1. Arrange for transfer to a suitable working medium such as 8 mm tape,
of full disk GMS time series data for a benchmark period of at least 12
months (nominally 1 July 1994-30 June 1995). <BR>
<BR>
2. Determine best practice approach to calibration, cloud identification,
and navigation of the benchmark data. This may involve use of data from
the &quot;CIGSN&quot; satellite calibration network<B> </B>(Prata et al,
1995).<BR>
<BR>
3. Determine range of science data products to be derived from benchmark
data set. Mandatory products are metadata, and digital quick look files.
Other products may include, for example, albedo, photosynthetically active
radiation, net solar radiation, SST, water vapour (GMS5); time lapse movie
loops; or examples of machine pattern recognition searches. <BR>
<BR>
4. Determine best means of making data sets widely available (eg network
access). This may involve consideration of public domain tools such as EosDIS
Information Management System, or other means of data set visualisation,
browsing and request; and the availability of suitable communication and
mass storage facilities.<BR>
<BR>
5. Carry out quantitative comparisons of GMS Pathfinder products with those
from comparable activities (eg GOES data of geographic area covered by both
sensors; products currently used by BoM, JAM). <BR>
<BR>
6. Determine stability of radiometric calibration and navigation of GMS
data over the benchmark period.<BR>
<BR>
7. Observe conditions of Bureau of Meteorology/Japan Meteorological Agency
agreement in relation to GMS; and advise on any steps necessary to facilitate
distribution of GMS Pathfinder data products consistent with this agreement.
