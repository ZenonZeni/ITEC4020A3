<P>
After the acquisition of AESOP, our Clinical Education Specialists
provide in-servicing for nurses, surgeons, OR technicians and
other interested staff at your facility. Product 
in-servicing usually involves a short presentation of AESOP fundamentals
and then moves directly into hands-on practice. We have found
that proficiency with the robotic arm develops in direct proportion
to the frequency of utilization.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Accredited Educational Program<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The incorporation of robotics into the perioperative arena requires
the development of new skills by hospital personnel. To aid in
this process, Computer Motion has developed a series of accredited
continuing education offerings. The Clinical Robotic Specialist
Program (CRSP) is a full-day course accredited for 10 contact
hours. Through extensive hands-on practice, participants become
comfortable with the System and gain confidence with setup and
operation. Please contact the Computer Motion Clinical Education
Specialist in your area for more information regarding this course.

We are committed to providing thorough clinical support to our
AESOP accounts. Becoming adept with AESOP in the operating room
is facilitated by both our Clinical Education Specialists and our
Regional Sales Directors. Clinical support is the first step in
the training program which we have created to bring our customers
to a high level of competence and comfort using the robotic arm.

AESOP has been widely accepted by the nation's leading surgeons
and has been integrated into many of the training programs at
these centers. These programs are comprised of classroom lectures
and hands-on training within a simulated surgical environment.
The learning surgeon is able to become familiar with the key features
and benefits of AESOP and gain hands-on experience under the guidance
of an experienced surgeon user. <BR>
