NewsNet has been one of the world's most prominent online information services for more than 15 years. Designed to keep busy knowledge workers and business executives informed of the latest news and analysis from leading publications, we have built a reputation for excellence in ease of use and our outstanding customer service. Our exclusive NewsFlash<SUP>&reg;</SUP> personalized-clipping agent has been acclaimed as the most flexible and robust in the industry.<P>

Today, we offer our worldwide clients immediate access to the complete 
full text of more than 1000 newsletters, newswires, magazines, and 
specialized business sources.<P>

NewsNet is especially well known for the timeliness of its information sources. NewsNet covers more than 40 industry areas and offers access to more real-time newswires than any other online database. You'll find leading daily business publications such as <I>American Banker, Bond Buyer, Comline</I> (from Japan), <I>Communications Daily, Computergram International</I> (from the U.K.),<I> Defense Daily, Education Daily, the Financial Times of London, Health News Daily, Newsbytes,</I> and dozens more, as well as vital business references such as Dun & Bradstreet, Standard & Poor's and TRW Business Profiles.<P>

Unlike most Internet-based news services, all of our information is accessible in a central computer database where powerful search and retrieval capabilities can find just the news you need in seconds, without time-consuming browsing and fruitless site visits. Subscribers to our system may choose to access this information from a Windows-based graphical interface called Baton, by powerful keyboard access, or by our new World Wide Web interface.<P>

I invite you to browse through our list of <a href="nnic.html">Information Sources,</a> which is organized by industry segments; take a <a href="nntour.html">Tour of NewsNet</a> to see how our Baton software can put the power of our services to work for you; and check out some <a href="nncase.html">Case Histories</a> explaining how other knowledge workers have made NewsNet an essential tool for success. You can even have a peek at our <a href="nndemo.html">NewsFlash on the Web</a> product or download our <a href="nnbaton.html">Baton software</a> for a free trial of our proprietary online service. If you'd like personal
