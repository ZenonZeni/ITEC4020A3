				LAS VEGAS, USA&#0151;The World Gaming Congress and Expo '96 hosted by the International Gaming and Wagering Business (IGWB) took place in Las Vegas between 1 and 3 October. The central theme of the conference was Casinos and other varieties of profit-making gaming, but charitable gaming operations and lotteries were also discussed in detail, in the many workshops and seminars that took place during the three day seminar.
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The keynote speech for the conference was presented by ‘futurist’ Frank Feather, author of ‘G Forces: The 35 Global Forces Restructuring our Future’. The world-renowned business strategist presented a thought-provoking forecast of trends most likely to impact the gaming industry in the year 2000 and beyond., considering a range of topics from socio-cultural issues to economics, environmentalism and advanced technology. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Feather spoke of his vision of the future where companies are forced to reorganise global strategies in order to achieve success in the local marketplace. Included in the strategist's outlook for the future of gaming is greater involvement in the Internet, as a new medium for current gaming companies. His thoughts were echoed in many of the conference’s other speeches and workshops. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Throughout the 3 day event, there was much talk about the possibilities that the Internet afforded over the next few years as well as discussions about current online gaming such as <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a> who have set up an online lottery service. The consensus of discussions inside and outside of the conference were that companies wishing to offer gaming over the Internet had to display impeccable standards of service and prove to potential customers that they had the right credentials. Above all, legality was a major issue. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					If customers were not sure that they were playing on a legal system, it was believed that they would not be willing to spend their money. Several of the Internet gaming systems currently available have not been legally authenticated, unlike <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a> which exists with the full cooperation of the government of the principality of Liechtenstein.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The sponsors of the event, IGWB, produce a magazine read by many in the gaming community. The cover story on October’s issue joined Frank Feather in his interest in online gaming. The story ‘Lotto shows life on the Internet’ discussed <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>’s performance since it was established in October 1995. The article in the respected publication by Patricia McQueen included an interview with James Tucker, <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>’s spokesman.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The article soberly discussed <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>’s success rate and the possibilities for an online charitable lottery, as well as issues of legality and the types of games that are currently available on the pioneering lottery system. McQueen noted, ‘Instant tickets became <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>InterLotto</a>’s second offering in January, and they have rapidly become the most popular game.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Recognition from the world wide gaming community is essential to the success of Inteenet gaming. Early signs indicate that more commercial groups are more than willing to embrace new technologies if they seem to be pertinent to future development and expansion within the industry as a whole. Watch this space for developments as they happen.
