<FONT SIZE=3><B>A commodity jurisdiction (CJ) request is used to determine whether an item or service is subject to the export licensing authority of the Department of Commerce or the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC).  BXA is the primary licensing agency for <A href="#index9"><B><I>dual-use</I></B></A> exports, while the DTC licenses defense articles and services.  If you are not completely sure of the export licensing jurisdiction of an item, you should request a CJ determination.  You can also submit a CJ request if you believe that jurisdiction of an item has been incorrectly assigned and should be transferred to another agency.  A CJ determination will only identify the proper licensing authority for an item, and is not a license or approval to export. <P>

CJ requests are processed by DTC under procedures established by that office.  You should contact that office for the specific procedures, but generally, to submit a CJ request, send a letter and supporting documents to DTC.  To avoid delays in the interagency coordination process the Department of State suggests you include nine complete collated sets of the letter and attachments.  If you believe that the current jurisdiction of the item is incorrectly assigned, provide an explanation outlining the reasons.   DTC will send copies of the CJ request to appropriate U.S. Government agencies, including Commerce, for review.  Upon receipt of recommendations from reviewing agencies, DTC will make a jurisdiction determination and notify the reviewing agencies.  DTC will provide the applicant with final notification of the decision by letter. <P> 

For specific instructions you may contact DTC by telephone at (703) 812-2576, or via fax at (703) 875-6647.  Please make your fax  ATTN: PM/DTC/CJ </B><P>

</font><font size=2>The convenient term "dual use" is sometimes used to distinguish the types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered by the regulations of certain other export licensing agencies.  In general, the term dual use serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in sensitive (e.g., military or nuclear) and other, non- sensitive applications from those that are (a) weapons or military-related in use or design and subject to the controls of the Department of State or (b) subject to the nuclear-related controls of the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Note, however, that although the short-hand term dual use may be employed to refer to the entire scope of the EAR, the EAR also apply to some items that have solely civil uses.
