<h1>The Electronic School</h1><br><br>
<p><hr>
<b>A development project on computer-based teaching at <a href="http://www.snet.uvm.dk/gym/hogym/hogymeng.htm">Holstebro Upper-Secondary School</a> and <a href="http://www.nrsbgym.dk/">N&oslash;rresundby Upper-Secondary School</a>.</b>

<b>The Electronic School</b><br>
From 1995 to 1998 two Danish upper-secondary schools are carrying out a comprehensive development project on computer-based teaching. The project is called "The Electronic School" and Holstebro Upper-Secondary School as well as N&oslash;rresundby Upper-Secondary School are participating, with one class at each school. The project is to provide experience in using the most recent computer technology in teaching.
<p>
<b>Co-operation</b><br>
The project was implemented on the initiative of the <a href="http://www.uvm.dk/eng.htm">Ministry of Education</A> in co-operation with <a href="http://www.teledanmark.dk/">Teledanmark</A>, <a href="http://www.ibm.dk/">IBM Denmark</A> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Computers</A>. These firms have made sophisticated computer and communication equipment available to the two schools, among other things a laptop computer for each student in the two classes, as well as one for each of the class's teachers. In addition a number of software manufacturers have contributed computer programs for use in teaching. Through the co-operation of many parties, the framework has been established for a project that can produce exciting results not just within a Danish context, but in an international perspective as well.
<p>
<b>Aims and Objectives<br></b>
The project deals with school development as well as development in the educational sector, along with development in subject-specific and pedagogical areas. Through trying out state-of-the-art  technology and software, the aim of the project is to gain experience concerning how the computer can be used to advantage in instruction -- both in the various subjects and in a more general pedagogical way. An equally important aim is to gain experience concerning how and when the computer should not be used.
<p>
<b>Expectations</b><br>
The project is expected to have great importance concerning how schools and instruction should be organised. On some points fairly major changes might be indicated, even in areas that are fundamental for teaching and for the learning process. It is vital that this development can take place on the basis of more than what is technically possible and that by means of experimentation opportunities will be created for evaluated the consequences of computer-based teaching and alternatives to it.
<p>
<b>What Is to Be Changed?</b><br>
The project involves all the subjects taught in the two classes, and in each subject the aim is to shed light on the needs and possibilities that developments in information technology provide in the following areas:
<ul>
<dl><li>changes in subject content<br>
<li>changes in examinations<br>
<li>changes in the organisation and arrangement of instruction as well as in teaching methods<br>
<li>use of computer-based teaching material<br>
<li>developing new teaching material<br>
<li>giving teachers additional qualifications<br>
</dl>
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Organisation of Instruction</b><br>
In particular substantial changes are expected in the way instruction is organised. The project can provide experience in the following areas:
<ul>
<dl>
<li>changes in the roles of students and teachers<br>
<li>flexibility in instruction (time, place and content)<br>
<li>process-orientated writing<br>
<li>process-orientated pedagogy<br>
<li>communication:
  among the students, between students and teachers, among the teachers themselves, between students and teachers at other schools in Denmark and abroad<br>
<li>differentiated teaching<br>
<li>use of the principles of remote teaching in an interplay with distributed teaching and classroom teaching<br>
<li>importance of  group or class feeling in relationship to individualisation<br>
</dl>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Rational Use of Technology and Resources</b><br>
The project can provide experience and reveal problems that are relevant for working out a strategy for the rational use of technology and resources in the educational sector. Experience and problems concern both the process and the results on the following levels:
<ul>
<dl>
<li>individual and group levels<br>
<li>institutional level (the school)<br>
<li>local community level (the school as a technological resource centre, locally and 	regionally)<br>
<li>national level (education generally in an interplay with outside factors)<br>
<li>international level (interplay across borders, new forms of working together regionally and globally)<br>
</dl>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><br>
The participating teachers carry out continuous evaluation of the project in co-operation with the Ministry of Education's subject advisers, subject committees and outside experts. The Ministry attaches importance to disseminating the results of the project as widely as possible by making use of the experience at other upper-secondary schools and (to the extent that it is relevant) in the entire educational sector. The experience and results will be continuously made available through newsletters to other schools and to the public at large, through distance teaching for teachers at other schools as well as in actual project reports.
