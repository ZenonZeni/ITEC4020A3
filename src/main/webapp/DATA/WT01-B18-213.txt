<title>Parabolic Troughs</title>

<H4>a. Parabolic Troughs<I><BR>
</B></I></H4>
Of the three technologies, only parabolic troughs have been 
developed to commercial scale.<a href="#348" name="r348"> [ 348 ] </a>Luz International, Ltd. installed 
parabolic trough technology at nine plants between 1984 and 1990. To 
finance the plants, Luz used federal and California tax incentives, 
international tax incentives for equipment purchases, and favorable power 
purchase agreements. Although Luz is now out of business, other owners are 
still operating its solar thermal plants, selling power to Southern 
California Edison. While Luz was operating the plants, it dramatically 
reduced generation costs from nearly 25 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1984 to 
around 9 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1989. <A NAME="SandiaNationalLaboratories">Sandia National Laboratories<a> 
estimates that new parabolic trough plants could produce electricity for 8 
to 14 cents per kilowatt-hour, depending on tax incentives and plant 
size.<a href="#349" name="r349"> [ 349 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="348"  HREF="#r348">348.</a> Parabolic troughs consist of long rows of concentrators that are 
curved in only one dimension, forming troughs. The troughs are mounted on 
a single-axis tracking system that tracks the sun from east to west. They 
are lined with a reflective surface that focuses the sun's energy onto a 
pipe located along the trough's focal line. A heat transfer fluid is 
circulated through the pipes and then pumped to a central storage area, 
where it passes through a heat exchanger. The heat is then transferred to 
a working fluid, usually water, which is flashed into steam to drive a 
conventional steam turbine. <BR>

<P><A NAME="349"  HREF="#r349">349.</a> Without favorable tax treatment, a parabolic trough system would 
generate electricity for about 17 cents per kilowatt-hour today.
