Young Children
</CENTER></H3>

The Canadian Dental Association recommends that fluoride supplements should
not be used for children younger than three years of age. 
<P><B>Editor's note:</B> <I>Many
researchers and physicians do not recommend fluoride treatment at any age. If
your household is using toothpaste containing fluoride, please supervise its use
for children under six. Nausea can result if children suck on or use too much of
the fluoride-containing toothpaste. Better yet, consider changing the toothpaste
to a nonfluoride brand.</I> Alternative Medicine Digest <I>will focus on the problems
and politics of fluoride in an upcoming issue.</I>

<HR><A NAME="salt">     </A><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>How to Correct Gum Disease</CENTER></H3>

        For healthier gums, prepare a mixture of one part salt and six parts baking
soda. Place ingredients in blender and mix for thirty seconds. Place in
container. Wet the tip of your index finger, place in salt and soda, pat a light
coat on your gums. Start with the upper outside of your gums, then the inside of
the upper, followed by the lower outside of the gums, then the lower inside.
Spit out excess-two or three times. Some of the salt and soda will remain to
remove the plaque. After fifteen minutes, rinse. 
<A NAME="aloe"> </A>
<P>You can follow this procedure
by placing a small amount of aloe gel in the palm of your hand. Blot your brush
lightly in the gel and gently pat on your gums, using the same sequence as the
salt and soda mix. The aloe will kill parasites on contact.

        At age twelve, a kind uncle took me to a dentist for my first visit, and to
no one's surprise I had a dozen teeth drilled and filled. By age 25, I was very
familiar with root-canal therapy. As a senior citizen and spokesperson for
healthful living since that time (I have very definitely walked my talk over the
decades), the only part of me that has not responded to optimal nutrient intake
has been the man-made, nonliving dental insertions. They continue to break down.

<A NAME="detox"> </A>
<P>     A few months ago, I was in agonizing pain-the kind one thinks only death
could possibly relieve. I went to a local dentist who told me I had a large
abscess under a decayed filling-so large, in fact, that I would have to go to an
endodontist immediately. Don't even go home, he cautioned. I would be cut,
drained, medicated, root-canalled, and unable to function for at least a week.
<A NAME="VITC"> </A>
<P>Well, I did go home, where I decided to use the testing laboratory that stood me
in good stead over the years: ME! I lined up every supplement bottle in the
cupboard and fridge-at the ready for ingestion each half hour, with the
exception of vitamin C, which I took every twenty minutes in one-gram doses. I
ate nothing but The Soup-a detoxifying recipe loaded with nutrients (see below
for recipe). 

<P>By day two, I felt incredibly better. On the third day, I went back
to the dentist to confirm my suspicion that the abscess was gone. The nurses
hovered around, hanging on my every word in wonderment at the "miracle" as they
took turns inspecting my mouth. The dentist slithered into the background, no
comment. 

<P>The initial cause of the problem did not go away. But I know that a
continued healthful lifestyle and daily detoxification program, as described by
Dr. Corsello in the last issue and in this issue of the Digest, will help to
prevent the nasty symptoms from surfacing again.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Toss a little of each of the vegetables on hand in your
refrigerator into a pot of filtered water. If possible, try to include many
greens, such as carrot tops, beet tops, kale, and parsley. Even better, include
daikon leaves, daikon root, burdock, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, and garlic.
Bring to a boil; then simmer for several hours. Drink only the broth on the
first day. Consume broth and vegetables the next two days. During this three-day
detoxification program, eat nothing else, but take your supplements in greater
quantities, including acidophilus and, especially, large amounts of vitamin C.
Continue beyond three days if necessary. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
        Dr. Meinig, a founding member of the American Association of Endodontists
(root-canal therapists), explained that, while dentists fill the root canal,
there are still over three miles of inaccessible, untreated tubules from which
germs can pour toxins into your body. These poisons can affect your heart,
kidneys, lungs, eyes, stomach, brain, and countless other body tissues. What
most dentists are not aware of, Meinig says, is that the bacteria causing the
infections are not in the root canal itself but are organisms that become locked
in the tubules that make up all of the dentin of teeth. When they escape from
teeth, the germs involved act much like cancer cells, which metastasize to other
parts ofthe body. In other words, root-canal-filled teeth always remain infected
and thus threaten health and life. 

<P>So what's a person to do? We all know that
prevention is best and that the factors that create dental caries can be
modified by diet. Here is one example: Dentin isn't as hard as enamel because it
is composed oftiny hollow tubules that contain a fluid carrying nutrients to
keep teeth healthy. But the fluid flow in the dentin tubules is actually
reversed when a person eats sugar! The flow has even been shown to reverse when
sugar is injected under the skin ofthe abdomens of test animals. So sugar
doesn't have to touch teeth at all for its presence to result in a severe amount
of tooth decay.


<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;It is time for dentists and patients to realize that the decay of teth is
not just a local disturbance but is actually a systemic disease that involves
the whole body.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
        Needless to say, other good-health factors are involved, too, explained in
detail in Meinig's book. But what if you are already a root-canal victim? Not to
worry! If you keep your immune system in tip-top shape, you'll be able to keep
the germs under control. Heroic efforts will be needed, however, should you
suffer an accident or stress. Just don't be fooled into complacency because your
dentist told you that you have "totally healed." It is difficult for your
dentist to believe that you are still harboring infection when he sees what
appears to be the healing of large bone areas. 

<P>As Dr. Meinig concludes, "It is
time for dentists and patients to realize that the decay ofteeth is not just a
local disturbance but is actually a systemic disease that involves the whole
body."

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>     How Removal of Mercury Helped Relieve Osteoarthritis</CENTER></H3>

Roger Smith, a 67-year-old Maryland man, developed two very sore, stiff, and
painful thumbs within a few weeks. The thumbs indicated classic osteoarthritic
symptoms: bony swelling, plus creaking and cracking and pain when moved. Aware
of the conventional medicine normally prescribed for the condition, Smith chose
to seek an alternative course of treatment. 

<P>After research in his local library,
Smith decided to undergo a series of acupuncture treatments. The six-treatment
course, administered by Anne Strozier of Silver Spring, Maryland, appeared to be
successful. Smith's pain was relieved, and he emerged with a feeling of
well-being. 

<P>His practitioner, however, was not totally satisfied. She was
curious about what recent occurrence had caused the thumb problem. 

<P>About halfway
through the acupuncture treatment, Smith obtained a copy of Alternative
Medicine: The Definitive Guide. On page 536, Hal Huggins, DDS, of Colorado
Springs, Colorado, described the relationship between arthritis and dental
amalgams. This suggested a possible cause for Smith's attack. He had a large
mercury amalgam come loose. It had been drilled out and replaced with another
mercury amalgam about a month before his thumbs had started hurting. 

<P>With the
help of Anne Strozier, he found a Maryland dentist who specialized in treating
people with silver-amalgam problems. The dentist replaced the silver filling
with space-age plastic. Within a few months, the symptoms completely
disappeared, and Smith was able to resume his full physical routine.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Amalgam Issue as Seen by a Renowned Dentist</CENTER></H3>

        Hal A. Huggins, DDS, MS, summarizes the amalgam issue: "Nothing is as
permanent as a mistake in science. Today we are facing the results of a
scientific mistake made 160 years ago. This mistake was made for short-sighted
economic reasons and certainly without a vision of the suffering that it would
produce in succeeding generations. While the mistake is one of science, it
was based more on economic demands of the time rather than on scientific
research." 

<P>Dr. Huggins has treated heavy-metal toxic patients for 19 years. He
has developed a list of factors that indicate potential problems and, most
important of all, the potential for improvement. "Some of these factors are
chemistries," explains Dr. Huggins, "some are symptoms, some attitudinal, some
habits, some environmental. As you can see, it is a broad subject with many
variables." 

<P>Dr. Huggins offers a chart for determining your own toxicity
potential as a result of having amalgam fillings. For more information, call or
