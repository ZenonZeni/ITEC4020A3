wide variety of sources, such as the company's owners and/or officers; suppliers
that have dealt with the company; annual reports; public-record filings; financial
institutions; local, state, and federal agencies; trade tapes and newspapers.<P>

Through a special gateway arrangement with Dun & Bradstreet, three of D&B's most
popular reports--The Business Information Report, The Payment Analysis Report, and

<B>The Payment Analysis Report</B> (PAR) offers in-depth analysis of a company's
past and current payment habits as reported to D&B to help determine how and when
