THERMOSAFE PROTECTS ENZYMES AND REAGENTS

Polyfoam Packers Corporation has introduced an economical and
efficient benchtop system as an alternative to ice buckets for
keeping reagents and enzymes cool at the workstation. The
system, which has undergone extensive testing, provides the
largest cold bank and best insulation of any unit on the
market and is capable of holding product below 0 degree C
(32 degrees F) for over 13 hours, or below -12 degrees C
(10 degrees F) for 8 hours.

Priced at a fraction of the cost of competitive chillers, the
system consists of a two-piece expanded polystyrene foam
chest with removable microcentrifuge tube rack plus two
interchangeable sets of refrigerants.

The foam unit features high density, damage-resistant 1114,,
thick walls and as an added benefit, will safeguard reagents
against temperature fluctuations and power outages when stored
in the freezer. The removable lid incorporates an interlocking
design to stay securely in place, finger relief grips on top
for easy removal, and a contoured edge for convenient
stacking.

Microcentrifuge tube rack accommodates 15 .5 ml and 15 1.5 ml
tubes simultaneously and features an alphanumeric-grid
pattern for easy identification of vial samples.

The superior efficiency of the benchtop system is enhanced by
two sets of specially formulated gel packs. since only one gel
pack in each temperature range is necessary for operation of
the system, the alternates can be kept in the freezer ready
to use. There's no need to halt work due to a deteriorating
cold source as occurs with other systems. Because the gel pack
is removable, the entire unit does not require chilling, which
saves freezer space.

For more information or test results on the benchtop system,
contact Polyfoam Packers Corporation 2320 Foster Ave.,
Wheeling, Illinois 60090; (800)323-7442.

NIKON AND TECHNICAL INSTRUMENT COMPANY INTRODUCE
AFFORDABLE NEW CONFOCAL SYSTEM FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH

Nikon Corp. of Tokyo and Technical Instrument Company of San
Jose, California, have jointly announced a new type of
microscope system designed to meet the imaging needs of
biomedical researchers. Developed by Technical instrument
Company, the PCM 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope
system is being marketed exclusively by Nikon throughout the
world.

Scientists who can benefit from confocal capability in their
work include researchers who study a wide range of diseases
such as cancer, AIDS, and Alzheimers Disease, as well as those
in fields such as neuroscience, genetics and gene mapping,
cell biology, anatomy, and more. The new high-performance
system, which has been in development for two years, Provides
users with affordable confocal imaging, an extremely advanced
method of viewing living specimens. It can discriminate
between individual layers of tissue that are less than 1/100
the width of a human hair apart in depth, at a rate of one
full-frame image per second.

The PCM 2000, which is designed to be used without extensive
training, creates a personal confocal workstation at a highly
competitive price. Previous confocal instruments have been
several times more costly than the current systems, making
it necessary for groups of scientists to share a single unit.

"We believe that the PCM 2000 is a vital contributor to next-
generation imaging for life science researchers," said Gerald
F. Benham, manager of biomedical confocal systems for Nikon
Inc. "It offers individual users unprecedented access to
advanced optical imaging at an extraordinary price-performance
ratio, and becomes a complement to our already strong line of
high-level b confocal systems."

"Two well-respected companies have combined our talents to
offer the brightest intracellular confocal imaging system on
the market, and we look forward to working closely with hers
the world over," said Francis Lundy, president of Technical
Instrument Company.

Nikon Inc. is the U.S. distributor of world-renowned Nikon
Corp. biomedical, industrial, ophthalmic and surveying
instruments, Nikon 35mm cameras, speedlights and accessories,
Nikkor lenses, Nikonos underwater photographic systems, Nikon
eyewear, Nikon sports and recreational optics, and electronic
imaging products.

Founded in 1950, Technical Instrument Company is the leading
manufacturer of high- performance confocal microscope systems
for medical, industrial, semiconductor and pharmaceutical
applications.

SEPRAGEN RECEIVES RESIN PATENT WHICH ENHANCES CAPABILITY
FOR LARGE-SCALE CHROMATOGRAPHY PURIFICATION

Sepragen Corporation, of San Leandro, CA, has been awarded a
European patent on its Cellulosic Monolithic Resin Separations
Media, a specialized media for chromatographic separations
that is capable of high throughput in particulate-laden
streams.  Vinit Saxena, Sepragen president and chairman, said
the new resin overcomes clogging and other problems
experienced with traditional separations media which needs to
be pretreated to remove debris and aggregates.

"Sepragen's new media solves this problem and allows
extremely rapid purification of dirty protein solutions at a
fraction of the cost of traditional methods," Saxena said.
"Most media are beads, which are packed into a column and can
clog easily. Our material is made out of a special foam-like
material which has large channels that allow particles to go
through and small pores for sites for the molecules that need
to be bound. No beaded media have this kind of unique pore
structure."

"This new media fits perfectly into our strategy to develop
and market complete systems for large-scale purification and
processing."

Sepragen acquired this technology in 1994 through an asset
purchase of BPS Separations in the United Kingdom. The company
spent the last year in additional development of the product,
and is currently field testing the resin media. The company
was granted the European patent (#0530258) on Sept. 22, 1995.
A United States patent is pending.

Saxena said the application possibilities for this resin are
numerous. In the biotechnology area this chromatography media
enables purification of biological drugs from "whole cell
broth," thereby eliminating several pre- treatment steps
resulting in higher yields, faster processing and lower
manufacturing costs. In the food and environmental areas,
where the streams are generally "dirty", this media will
enable new chromatographic separations to be performed
economically for the first time.

Sepragen has been involved in the chromatography field since
its inception in 1985, and introduced its patented Radial Flow
Chromatography (RFC) columns in 1987. These columns improve on
traditional axial flow columns, a technology some 40 years
old.

Saxena said that adding this resin to its product line moves
Sepragen closer towards its long range goal of being the
leading provider of complete solutions for large-scale
chromatographic separations.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the development of
large-scale chromatography products and technology for the
biopharmaceutical industry. Sepragen markets its patented RFC
columns, computer-controlled workstations and process
technology to the biotechnology, food and environmental
industries.

The company's products are being used by leading biotech
companies as well as by food companies to produce new
value-added products and processes. Based in San Leandro,
California, the company markets its proprietary RFC technology
and services worldwide.

RCT PATENTS REAGENTS ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION OF AMINES

U.S. Patent No. 5,459,272 has been issued to Research
Corporation Technologies (RCT) for reagents that permit
ultrasensitive detection of amines. RCT exclusively licensed
the reagents to Molecular Probes, Inc. in Engene, Oregon in
1991 on behalf of Indiana University and the inventors. Dr.
Milos Novotny and associates.

Molecular Probes incorporated the technology in its ATTO-TAG
reagent kits for amine detection, including amino groups in
peptides and glycoproteins. Although nonfluorescent
themselves, they induce fluorescence in amine reaction
products at wavelengths beyond those of background substances.
These characteristics allow ALLO-TAG reagents to minimize
background interference and greatly increase sensitivity in
amine analyses compared to conventional reagents such as o-
phthaldialdehyde (OPA) and fluorescamine.

The reagents enable ultrasensitive fluorescence techniques to
be applied to a wide range of important compounds such as
peptides, amino acids and even carbohydrates. While ATTO-TAG
reagents can be used with absorption detection methods, their
superior fluorescence properties permit unparalleled
sensitivity and detection limits in liquid chromatography and
capillary electrophoresis.

Highly sensitive determinations of amino acids and peptides
are among the most important analyses required in research,
diagnostic and forensic applications for biochemistry,
agrochemistry and pharmaceuticals.

In addition to the fluorogenic reagent, ATTO-TAG kits include
samples of potassium cyanide and a protocol for amine
modification. Each kit can derivatize 100-200 samples,
depending on amine concentration and sample volume. Kits are
priced at $98 or $78.40 per kit in quantities of five. The
ATTO-TAG reagent is also available separately at S110 for 10
mg.

To place an order, contact Molecular Probes at (503)465-8300,
fax (800)438-0228.

For further information, call the Technical Assistance
Department at (503) 465-8353.  Molecular Probes, a private
biotechnology company, produces organic dyes, pigments an
d chemicals and provides custom synthesis, consulting and
contract research services.

SEPRAGEN REPORTS LOSS FOR THIRD QUARTER

Sepragen Corporation (NASDAQ: SPGNU, SPGNA, SPGNW, SPGNZ), of
San Leandro, CA, which develops and manufactures
chromatography columns and computer-controlled process systems
for the biotech and other industries, has reported results for
the quarter ended September 30, 1995.

Net sales for the 1995 quarter were $90,711, down from
$882,295 in the same period in 1994. The net loss for the
quarter ended September 30, 1995, was $873,319, or (0.31)
cents a share, compared with a loss of $45,846, or (0.06)
cents a share, for the 1994 quarter, based on a weighted
average number of shares outstanding of 2,855,032 and 735,528,
respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, net sales were
$888,643, down 45 percent from $1,607,050 for the same period
in 1994. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30
was $1,873,131, or (0.87) cents a share, compared with a loss
of $370,619 or (0.50) for the same period in 1994, based on a
weighted average number of shares outstanding of 2,141,595
and 735,528, respectively.

Vinit Saxena, president and chief executive officer, said the
higher 1994 sales figures reflected a large single order for
QuantaSep systems that the company shipped in the third
quarter of 1994. "We expect that revenues generated from sales
of large industrial scale Superflo columns and large QuantaSep
systems will continue to be a significant portion of our
revenue in the immediate future," Saxena said. "We have
experienced, and continue to experience, volatility in revenue
on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Selling, general and administrative costs totaled $593,778 in
the third quarter of 1995, nearly double the amount in the
third quarter of 1994. The expenses are part of the company's
plan to increase growth through new hires, plans for a new
facility and time spent on new marketing programs and
strategic alliances. In addition, the company's research and
development expenses were $287,745 in the third quarter of
1995, more than double the amount spent in the third quarter
of 1994. The increase was attributable to expenditures
related to the development of a process for dairy whey
fractionation, the development of a special absorbent media
and further development of QuantaSep products.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the development of
large-scale chromatography products and technology for the
biopharmaceutical industry. The company markets patented
Radial Flow Chromatography (RFC) columns, computer-controlled
process chromatography workstations and process technology to
the biotechnology and food industries. Based in San Leandro,

GENETIC WORKSTATION INTRODUCED BY VYSIS

Integrating various applications of cytogenetics and
karyotyping just became easier with the introduction of the
QUIPS Genetic Workstation from Vysis Inc., of Downers Grove,
IL. For research use in karyotyping, chromosomal evaluation,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses, the new integrated
system comprises a multitude of tools and optimized reagents
designed to easily capture, enhance, analyze and print high-
quality images.

The QUIPS Genetic Workstation allows researchers to visualize
fluorescent signals under a high-powered fluorescence
microscope. With a simple point and click, the user can
capture and resolve even closely spaced probe signals. The
system combines a high-performance, digital charged-couple
device (CCD) camera with powerful imaging software to permit
acquisition and analysis of even the weakest signals.
Resolution of the Photometrics CCD camera approaches the
theoretical maximum for light.

QUIPS configurations and tools include QUIPS-FISH, QUIPS-CGH,
QUIPS-AKS, and QUIPS-ACES.

The QUIPS-FISH system utilizes scientific grade CCD cameras
for unsurpassed spatial resolution and sensitivity with a wide
range of FISH probes and reagents. The system is equipped with
a complete set of filters and automation for most FISH imaging
needs, including Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH).
Featuring flexible text and graphic layout, QUIPS-FISH offers
accurate, high-resolution printing using dye sublimation
printers for a result that nears photographic quality.

Vysis offers a wide range of FISH probes and reagents
optimized for use with QUIPS-FISH instrumentation and filters.
Vysis CEP Chromosome Enumerator Probes, WCP Whole Chromosome
Paints, and LSI Loci-Specific Identifiers are powerful tools
for enumerating chromosomes in interphase or metaphase
preparations, identifying translocations, or determining other
chromosomal anomalies.

Vysis has designed the QUIPS Comparative Genomic Hybridization
(CGH) System to capture, analyze, visualize and produce rapid
quantitative interpretation and reports of CGH results in one
integrated unit. With CGH used more frequently now as a
powerful in situ hybridization tool for whole genomic DNA
analysis, accurate amplification of the ratio profile of two
fluorescent signals has gained in importance.

The system provides statistical interpretation of the ratio
profile information for quantitative comparison with control
data. In addition, it provides results-oriented automation and
integration of DAPI-banded karyotyping in a flexible data
format. Project management capabilities using a centralized
directory and near photographic quality output complete the
QUIPS-CGH System.

The QUIPS Automated Karyotyping System (AKS) automates the
process of capturing, enhancing, classifying and printing
high-quality images of chromosomes prearranged in a variety or
user-selected karyogram formats. QUIPS-AKS replaces 35mm
photography, darkroom processing and manual cutting and
pasting of chromosomes. The system provides auto-
classification of chromosomes and karyotyping of C, R, Q and
DAPI-banded chromosomes, managed by a centralized directory
for project management. The system simplifies results
reporting and provides near photographic quality high-
resolution accurate prints.

The QUIPS Automated Chromosomal Evaluation System (ACES)
increases throughput by scanning a slide and assessing
multiple gene probes in different colors within nuclei. An
example of the QUIPS ACES is counting human chromosomes in
amniocytes for ploidy status as related to genetic diseases.
The system automatically scans slides, isolates nuclei, and
counts multiple color signals to provide an easily interpreted
statistical result. Reliable unattended operation and rapid
image-acquisition and transfer increase the efficiency of the
cytogenetics laboratory, allowing technician time for other
required tasks. Vysis has designed the QUIPS ACES for future
expansion with additional assays and multiple slide
capabilities.
