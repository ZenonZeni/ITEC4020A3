research and academic publishing.  The College prepares its graduates within the 
discipline of Chinese medicine to diagnose, treat, prescribe and to appropriately
refer patients through communication and interaction with other primary health care
providers. </H5>

The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is distinguished not only
for pioneering the first graduate degree program in Chinese Medicine in the United 
States, but also for sponsorship of scholarly activities.  Since 1981, the College has 
published the Journal of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, one 
of the oldest English language journals in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.  
The  Journal  was  created  to encourage  research  and  translation  by  American 
practitioners of Chinese medicine.   At  this  time,  publication of  the  journal  is
temporarily suspended.
<P>
In 1985, the College joined with the Botanical Garden, University of California, Berkeley, 
to cosponsor, with the Guangzhou College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a collection 
of Chinese medicinal plants.</H5>
<P>
<I><B><H2>Medicinal Garden Project</H2></B></I>
<P><H5>
Since the Winter of 1990, an ACTCM student began to develop a medicinal herb 
garden on the school grounds.  Since that time, the Medicinal Herb Garden Project 
Director continues to develop the project.   The garden consists mainly of Chinese 
medicinal plants and some important European and North American herbs are included.  
The garden is intended to serve as an educational tool and to provide a place where
the general public may gain a greater awareness of Chinese medicine.  Students can 
be assisted in learning the usage of each plant, and both students and the general
public alike, can gain a deeper feeling and link with the herbs.  Plaques are placed in
 the garden containing information cards providing the Chinese and Latin names of the 
 herbs, the "temperature" (hot or cold), the taste (bitter, sweet, bland, etc.), and the 
 function in Chinese medicine.  Having close access to the living plants that are being 
 used at the school, is a valuable learning tool. Also, harvesting the useful parts of the
 plants, drying and tasting them firsthand, can be an enlightening experience that can 
 connect one to the botanical in a special and personal way.  The plants have been 
 obtained as young plants from nurseries, botanical gardens, private individuals, and 
 from seed.  Contacts for the plants and seeds have been made from as far away as 
 Europe, Japan, Korea, and China.
<P>
In 1996 the gardens' management was assumed by the student garden project group.  
The garden is a work in progress.  New contacts and new plants/seeds are continuously 
being sought out.  There are plans to translate and compile information on the usage of 
many of the species grown here which are not yet listed in the current medical materials 
in English.  Students are encouraged to assist the Garden Project Group and to be involved
in the project.</H4><P>
<I><B><H2>International Visitor's Program</H2></B></I>
<P><H5>
The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine was  authorized by the United 
States Information Service to issue IAP-66 visa authorizations for "International Visitors" 
from the People's Republic of China who wished to participate in the College's  Exchange 
Visitor Program.  Currently, the College is applying for a expanded scope for the Exchange 
Visitor Program.<P></H5>
<I><B><H2>American College H.I.V. Clinic Program</H2></B></I>
<P><H5>
On July 1, 1992, the College entered into a contract with the San Francisco Department 
of Public Health AIDS Office to provide medical care to people with HIV using acupuncture 
and herbal medicine.  Funding for this contract is provided by the Ryan White Comprehensive
 AIDS Resources Emergency (C.A.R.E.) Act.  The College formed a Community Advisory 
 Committee to provide input and feedback in the development and implementation of the 
 program.  
<P>
To facilitate this program, the College expanded clinic hours, and hired additional staff 
acupuncturists, including Spanish-speaking bi-cultural practitioners.  The College began
outreach and community education efforts to other AIDS service providers and increased  
the number of HIV+ patient visits from an estimated 65 per month to 250 per month.  
<P>
As a result of these efforts, the College has created a model for Chinese medicine care for 
people with HIV, has delivered this service to San Franciscans in need, and provided an 
outstanding opportunity for faculty and students to study HIV/AIDS and its impact on individuals 
and society.  In addition, the College is developing relationships to other health care providers in 
the local community and around the world.</H5><P>
