TAIWAN SELECTS ENSERCH, INTERGEN, SCEPTRE IN SECOND ROUND OF IPP BIDS

Enserch Development Corp., International Generating Co. (Intergen) and
Sceptre Power are members of four consortia proposing a total of 3,750 MW
that were selected by the government of Taiwan in the country's second
independent power solicitation, originally for 1,800 MW.
   The four consortia were among 18 bidders proposing 19 separate projects
representing 10,050 MW of new capacity for the solicitation.
   Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) selected from the
first round of proposals seven consortia to build a total of 7,110 MW (IPR,
28 July '95, 1). In that bidding, developers proposed 23 projects
representing more than 30,300 MW.
   Many of the projects selected in the first round have stalled due to the
lack of development experience among the local sponsors (IPR, 20 Oct '95,
1).
   In the latest round, Enserch Development of Dallas said it is part of a
consortium that will build, own and operate a 500-MW, oil-fired, project in
the northern city of Hualien.
   Enserch officials said the company will hold a 30% equity stake in the
project, while 70% will be held by two domestic partners, the Fubon Group
and the Ambassador Group.
   The consortium will spend the rest of 1996 on preliminary development
and expects to begin construction sometime in 1997. Commercial operation
will begin after 1999.
   Boston-based Intergen, a joint venture of Bechtel Group and Pacific Gas
& Electric affiliates, was selected to develop a private power project of
between 1,200 MW and 1,500 MW in a location known as Lizhe. Intergen
declined to release details of the project, but it will be in a joint
venture with a local Taiwanese company.
   Sceptre Power officials declined to release project details, but said
the company is actively developing a project in Taiwan. Reportedly, Sceptre
will have a partner, perhaps Taiwan Sakura Co., in a 1,224-MW, oil-fired
project in Suao.
   A fourth award, to a joint venture of Taiwan's Cheng-Chou Electronics
and ESC of Germany, was for a 600-MW to 700-MW project in Hsin-Chu, though
this could not be confirmed at presstime.
   All four projects are expected to be in commercial operation by 2000 or
2001.
   The government said power rates offered by developers were very
competitive, but did not offer details. The developers now must focus on
obtaining environmental approvals.

S&P DOWNGRADES SOME PROJECT DEBT DUE TO NIMO PRESSURE ON NUG PACTS

   Standard & Poor's has downgraded two non-utility generation debt issues
because of their reliance on payments by Niagara Mohawk Power, which is
moving aggressively to restructure contracts.
   In its ``Power Choice'' proposal, submitted to the New York Public
Service Commission last fall, NiMo offered to open up its service territory
to retail competition, but only if it could restructure the above-market
contracts, which it blames for much of its high rates (IPR, 20 Oct '95,
1).
   If it cannot restructure those pacts, NiMo said, it will seek to take
over projects through its power of eminent domain, then auction them off to
parties that would sell at market prices.
   In addition, NiMo raised the prospect that it might seek Chapter 11
protection under federal bankruptcy laws, which would most likely reduce
payments to NUGs.
   In response, S&P set a BBB- rating for the first mortgage bonds of
Selkirk Cogen Funding Corp., and affirmed that rating on Jan. 5, adding
that the rating outlook is now negative.
   The $392-million debt issue relates to the 332-MW Selkirk cogeneration
project, developed by Cogen Technologies, with a 79% stake, along with
Energy Initiatives, Tomen Power, and U.S. Generating.
   S&P fears the cash flows supporting the debt could be eroded if NiMo
forces a renegotiation of the power-sales contract, or pursues a Chapter 11
filing, it stated. The ratings agency reached that conclusion despite the
fact that the Selkirk project sells only 20% of its power to NiMo, with
most of the output going to Consolidated Edison.
   However, because of the minor reliance on NiMo, ``the project has the
flexibility to potentially absorb a partial loss of Niagara Mohawk
revenues, through contract renegotiation or otherwise, at the BBB- rating
level.'' Cogen Technologies could not be reached for comment by presstime.
   Also on Jan. 5, S&P lowered the ratings from BB to BBB- on senior
secured debt of Energy Investors Fund Funding Corp., and listed the outlook
as negative. Part of the downgrade for the $125-million issue stems from
NiMo's proposals, S&P said.
   Mark Tarini, treasurer of Boston-based Energy Investors Corp. (EIF),
told Independent Power Report the downgrade was not unexpected, since S&P
put the issue on ``CreditWatch'' after the NiMo proposal in October.
However, ``we were surprised they knocked us down two levels.''
   Tarini said the fund in question involves five projects connected with
NiMo: the High Falls and South Glens Falls projects, operated by Adirondack
Hydro, totaling 49 MW; a 58-MW hydro project operated by International
Paper; the Indeck/Olean Energy Center, an 80-MW gas-fired project owned and
operated by Indeck Energy Services in Olean, N.Y.; and the Salt City Energy
Venture, an 80-MW coal project in Solvay, N.Y., developed by CMS Generation
and other partners.
   In downgrading the EIF debt, S&P also cited the fund's investment in 71
MW of wind projects in California, which are owned and operated by
financially troubled Kenetech Corp. Kenetech has suffered financial
problems and a number of key executives including its CEO recently resigned
(IPR, 29 Dec '95, 3; 1 Dec '95, 1).
   If Kenetech recovers and NiMo does not pursue its threats, EIF plans to
lobby for an upgrading of the debt, Tarini said. However, he noted that
``downgrades are like gravity--once ratings go down, its hard to get out of
that hole.''

FORMOSA PLASTICS DEVELOPING TWO PROJECTS TOTALING 5,900 MW IN CHINA

   Formosa Plastics Co. of Taiwan said its Formosa Plastics Group (FPG)
will develop two coal-fired independent power plants totaling 5,900 MW in
the city of Zhangzhou in southern mainland China.
   The 3,500-MW and 2,400-MW plants will cost a total of $7-billion.
   Zhangzhou will provide a number of incentives, including 132-hectares of
land at no charge for five years and reduced charges for the following five
years.
   Formosa Plastics said it expected to bring in at least one equity
partner from the U.S. into the project.
   The company is also building an electric car battery manufacturing
facility in Zhangzhou in a joint venture with American Royal Co. Formosa
will produce the car batteries in mainland China and assemble the cars in
Taiwan.
   Formosa officials said the company is attempting to capitalize on the
experience it is gaining in Taiwan, where it is one of seven companies
selected in that country's first private power solicitation, and to take
advantage of the ``economic liberalization'' underway in China (IPR, 15 Dec
'95, 20).
   Under the name Mailiao Cogeneration Co., Formosa is developing a
1,350-MW, coal-fired plant on a Formosa site at Mailiao in Yunlin County,
Taiwan. The project is expected to be expanded to about 2,400 MW in the
years ahead. Formosa plans for the first phase to reach commercial
operation in 1999.
   Over the longer-term, FPG is also evaluating power project opportunities
in the Philippines.

EDF, ITALY'S EDISON AND FINEL CLOSE ON 600-MW ITALIAN GENERATING FIRM

   A joint venture of Italy's Edison SpA, Finel and Electricite de France
have completed the purchase of a 75% equity stake in the 600-MW Ilva
Servizi Energie (ISE), the power generation arm of Italy's state-owned
steel company Ilva.
   The 75% stake in ISE cost the two companies $220-million, which it paid
out of cash reserves without financing.
   ISE includes a 500-MW, gas-fired, cogeneration plant at Taranto and a
100-MW, gas-fired, cogeneration plant at Piombino in Tuscany. An additional
500-MW, combined-cycle unit is under construction at Taranto and a 170-MW,
combined-cycle unit is planned for Piombino.
   The Taranto plant supplies power and steam to the state-owned plastics
company, Ilva Laminati Piani.
   The additional generating units under construction will cost the
partners about $550-million to complete. Part of the those funds will come
from cash reserves and the remainder from traditional project financing,
which is currently being arranged with an undisclosed European bank.
   In early-1995, Edison and EdF were selected by the government over bids
by British Gas; Endesa of Spain; Mission Energy of the U.S. with Sondel of
Italy; Foster Wheeler Corp. of the U.S. and partners; and Waste Management
International (IPR, 27 Jan '95, 13).
   Edison is owned by Italian holding company Montedison SpA.

ENTERGY CLOSES $1.2-BILLION PURCHASE OF AUSTRALIAN DISTRIBUTOR CITIPOWER

   Entergy Corp. has reached financial closure on its (U.S.) $1.2-billion
acquisition of CitiPower Ltd., the Melbourne, Australia-based electric
power distributor (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 11).
   Entergy acquired CitiPower, its largest international investment to
date, through a solicitation released by the government of Victoria,
Australia.
   Entergy said Bank of America NT&SA, a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corp.,
was the loan arranger for the $914-million of debt financing used to
acquire CitiPower. Lead underwriters were ABN AMRO Australia Ltd., Bank of
America and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Entergy contributed
$286-million of equity.
   Commonwealth Bank served as the facility agent.
   Entergy also noted co-lead underwriter was Credit Suisse, and
sub-underwriters were Australian & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and IBJ
Australia Bank Ltd.
   Syndication of the $914-million was scheduled to begin within the first
weeks of January.
   CitiPower, with a customer base of some 233,000 customers, serves
Melbourne and its surrounding suburbs.
   Entergy vice president and general manager for Australian activities,
Larry Folks, said, ``It is our intention to work closely with CitiPower's
management team over the coming months to continue establishing best
practices targets and marketing strategies.''
   The Victorian government's deregulation of the electricity industry
means electricity prices will continue to fall, in real terms, at least
until 2000, said Folks.
   Tom Wright, previously vice president, transmission and distribution
systems for Entergy, was appointed CitiPower chief executive officer,
replacing former CitiPower CEO Shane Breheny, who became a transition
advisor.
   CitiPower represents Entergy's first investment in Australia and its
first major international investment it is making alone. In joint ventures
with others, Entergy is active in Argentina, Chile, China, Pakistan and
Peru.

FIRST GAS IN TALKS FOR FINANCING 880-MW GAS PROJECT IN PHILIPPINES

   First Gas Holdings Corp., a joint venture of First Philippine Holdings
of Manila and British Gas, is holding talks with Export Risk Guarantee of
Switzerland, KfW of Germany, Hermes of Germany and the Export-Import Bank
of the U.S., for financing an 880-MW gas-fired project in Sta Rita,
Batangas province, south of Manila.
   The project, expected to cost $600-million, was recently doubled in size
from 440 MW (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   Gas will come from the offshore Camago-Malampaya field, the Philippines'
biggest oil and gas find, which will be developed by the Philippine units
of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Occidental Petroleum of the U.S.
   Meanwhile, three firms have been qualified to submit a final bid to
build the plant--Asea Brown Boveri, Siemens, and Raytheon Engineers &
Constructors, said Ernesto Pantangco, an official of First Philippine
Holdings Corp.
   The three pre-qualified firms have been asked to submit a final bid on
Jan. 26, with the winner to be announced in March, he said.
   The plant, expected to enter service in 1998, could be built as a single
880-MW facility or with two, 440-MW units, depending on the plan submitted
by the winning bidder.

PHILIPPINE DEVELOPER TO FLOAT BONDS VALUED AT $85-MILLION IN U.S. MARKETS

   First Private Power Corp., a unit of First Philippine Holdings, is set
to float $85-million worth of 12-year bonds in major cities in the United
States next month, a company official said Tuesday.
   Proceeds of the flotation will be used to refinance the short-term
foreign currency depository unit loans FPPC incurred to build the 215-MW
diesel power plant in Bauangtown in La Union Province, which entered
service last year.
   Money from the refinancing scheme will also be used as a partial equity
contribution for a 880-MW gas-fired facility, which is being built jointly
with British Gas (see story above; IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   FPPC chief operating officer Ernesto Pantangco said the lead manager of
the flotation will be Salomon Brothers.
   The coupon rates will be pegged at between 325 and 375 basis points
above the seven-year U.S. Treasury bills. The bonds will have a maturity of
12 years.

UTILICORP, AIR PRODUCTS FORM LINK FOR GAS-FIRED PROJECTS IN MIDWEST

   UtiliCorp United has joined with Air Products & Chemicals to develop
gas-fired independent power projects in the Midwest. The partnership may
later expand its activities to other parts of the U.S. and overseas,
according to a UtiliCorp spokesman.
   UtiliCorp, based in Kansas City, Mo., operates Missouri Public Service
and WestPlains Energy divisions in Kansas and Colorado, along with some gas
utilities. It will pursue the joint projects through its unregulated UtilCo
Group subsidiary.
   Both companies have projects in operation and development, and have
already built two plants together: a 120-MW gas-fired cogeneration project
in Orlando, Fla., which began operating in 1993, selling power to Florida
Power and the Reedy Creek Improvement District; and a 49.9-MW coal-fired
cogeneration plant in Stockton, Calif., in service since 1988 and selling
electricity to Pacific Gas & Electric.
   The companies will focus on the Midwest because they have identified a
need for gas-fired capacity in the region, according to the UtiliCorp
spokesman. He added UtiliCorp brings a knowledge of the Midwest service
area, the regulatory environment and of other utilities in the region.
   Frank Costanza, UtiliCorp vice president of power services, told
Independent Power Report the partners may consider building uncommitted
``merchant plant'' components into some projects. However, until regulatory
uncertainties are resolved, the companies would want to secure purchasers
for most of the output.
   As competitive markets emerge, they may consider a purely merchant
approach--where plants are built without long-term contracts for the
output.
   Altogether, UtilCo Group has 319 MW of equity in 17 operating plants
totaling 800 MW from gas, coal waste and hydro sources, all in the U.S. In
addition, the company is developing a 60-MW plant in Jamaica.
   Air Products & Chemicals has 176 MW of equity in six operating plants
totaling more than 300 MW, including three in-house projects at its
industrial gas and chemical facilities.
   The company also has four projects in development, representing 650 to
725 MW, including a plant in the Czech Republic that is on hold pending the
country's restructuring efforts.
   Except for the Orlando project with UtilCo Group, all of Air Products'
plants involve coal or coal waste.
   Recently, Metropolitan Edison asked Air Products to restructure a 227-MW
coal project to gas in order to lower the capacity payments, but the
parties could not agree on terms, and Met-Ed agreed to buy out the contract
for up to $35-million (see story, page 10).

IDAHO POWER CONSIDERS RENEWABLES SUBSIDIARY; INDONESIA FIRST TARGET

   Idaho Power said it will decide by late spring whether to establish an
independent power subsidiary or energy services company to develop
photovoltaic systems and other renewable energy projects in international
markets.
   Indonesia is an immediate target because the government has begun a
Transmigration Program to encourage its citizens to relocate to outlying
regions, including some of the country's hundreds of islands. Indonesia has
the world's fourth largest population, with most people living in the major
cities.
   The government has earmarked $100-million for the electrification
component of its Transmigration Program. But rather than build a large
power plant on each island, which would be cost prohibitive, the government
is studying the possibility of small hydro and photovoltaics (PV).
   ``Our involvement in the preliminary stages of this project could be the
first step in a broad effort to expand our growth opportunities beyond what
has been considered typical for this company,'' said Joe Marshall, chief
executive officer.
   Idaho Power has been developing PV experience since 1993. In its first
two years, it installed sites in Idaho totaling 3 kW. In 1995 alone, it
installed 86 kW and sources said 1996 will be a pivotal year to decide its
strategy for the future.
   PV systems convert sunlight directly into electricity and can be used to
provide electricity to power water pumps, lighting or refrigeration.
   Idaho Power's engineers have traveled to Indonesia with Community Power
Corp., based in Virginia, to assess the potential for PV in that country.
Idaho Power also is interested in building small hydro, tapping its
considerable experience in the U.S.
   ``Developing PV systems could be a good niche for us internationally,''
said Larry Crowley, Idaho Power's senior manager of strategic planning.
``Our utility has developed a reputation for being a leader in PV
systems.''

CORDELL HULL, ERIC ZAUSNER ESTABLISH FIRM FOR INTERNATIONAL ENERGY ASSETS

   Cordell Hull, recently retired as executive vice president of Bechtel,
and Eric Zausner, a deputy administrator of the Dept. of Energy in the Ford
Administration, have formed Energy Asset Management LLC to develop and
acquire international energy infrastructure assets.
   Hull is chairman of the new company, based in San Francisco, and Zausner
is president. Zausner said it was too early to say more about the company,
which is just getting organized.
   One of Energy Asset Management's first projects is assisting Los
Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises International in acquiring a 12.5%
interest in two Argentine natural gas utility holding companies. Los
Angeles-based PEI, an affiliate of Southern California Gas, announced on
Jan. 2 that discussions and due diligence were proceeding with Sodigas
Pampana SA and Sodigas Sur SA.

TENNECO BUYS 10% OF AUSTRALIAN GAS, POWER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

   Tenneco Power of Houston is taking a 10% equity stake in independent
power developer Energy Equity Corp. Ltd. (EEC) of Perth, Australia, which
has several projects underway (IPR, 3 Nov '95, 6).
   Tenneco Power, a unit of Tenneco Gas, will also take a seat on EEC's
board of directors. EEC's stock is traded on the Australian Stock
Exchange.
   In addition, Tenneco will take a 50% equity stake in EEC's 135-MW,
gas-fired Sulawesi independent power plant that will sell electricity to
Indonesia's state-owned electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).
   Tenneco is also taking an equity stake in EEC's Indonesian Sengkang
onshore natural gas field, estimated to have proven and probable reserves
of 500-billion cubic feet.
   Tenneco is expected to pay about (U.S.) $21-million for the equity in
both projects.
   Financial close on the power project and pipeline is expected in
early-1996.
   As part of its agreement with EEC, Tenneco said it will arrange
financing for the projects.
   Construction of the Sulawesi power plant began in November, with
commercial operation scheduled for early-1997. Tenneco said the
power-purchase agreement with PLN is for a term of 20 years and was
concluded after negotiations between EEC and PLN.
   EEC also holds a 21-year, take-or-pay power-purchase agreement with the
Queensland Electricity Commission for a 37-MW, gas-fired power project. EEC
closed financing for the project with Barclays Bank Australia Ltd. and the
Bank of Western Australia Ltd.
   Separately, Tenneco plans possible power projects from the 470-mile,
16-inch, Moomba-Adelaide pipeline gas pipeline in Australia, which the
company recently purchased.
   Tenneco has separate interests in power projects in Brazil, Chile and
Taiwan.

THAILAND'S EGCO EYES PLANTS IN LAOS CHINA, VIETNAM, INDONESIA, MYANMAR

   One year after becoming a publicly traded company, the Electricity
Generating Public Co. (Egco) of Thailand, a spinoff of the government power
authority, is moving across Thai borders in search of new investments in
China, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos.
   The company's initial impetus to build plants across the border in Laos
to fuel Thailand's growing demand has evolved into expansion for the sake
of investment, said Siwanan Na Nakorn, Egco executive director and deputy
managing director for new business ventures.
   In China, the company is exploring a joint venture with Huaneng Power
International, to build a 300-MW coal-fired plant in Shanghai.
   Huaneng would hold 70% of the equity and 30% would be owned by Egco.
Siwanan said Egco is working with Thai partners in the venture but declined
to disclose their identities.
   In Myanmar, Egco, in a consortium with the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand and British Gas, is likely to bid on a project that includes a gas
pipeline, a first-stage 200-MW power unit and fertilizer plant.
   In Vietnam, Egco plans to build a 200-MW combined-cycle plant at the
Amata City Bien Hoa industrial park, now under construction outside of Ho
Chi Min City. Egco's equity stake is still under negotiation.
   The Vietnamese government recently asked Egco to increase the initial
capacity of the plant, from 30 MW to 60 MW, to supply areas surrounding the
industrial park.
   Vietnam is also asking Egco to move up the starting date, from late-1997
to late-1996. But Egco and the Vietnamese have not arrived on the price of
the increased power and the company is seeking relief from a tax on diesel
fuel, since the gas pipeline to supply the plant will not be in place until
1998 or 1999.
   The project is a joint venture with Bangpakong Industrial Park of
Thailand.
   Egco is also negotiating with a mine concession holder in Indonesia to
build a mine-mouth coal-fired plant--or simply a mine--in Sumatra or
Kalimantan.
   In Laos, the company has been negotiating with Thai Lao Lignite Corp., a
concession holder, to build a lignite-fired plant in Hong Sa near the
Thai-Lao border. The plant, which would come on-line at 600 MW and
ultimately reach 1,200 MW, would supply Thailand. Siwanan said those
discussions are on hold because of differences over price.
   At home, Egco plans to bid on the next 1,000-MW independent power
solicitation held by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (IPR,
15 Dec '95, 8). EGAT is expected to announce a second 1,000-MW round in
1996, though many bidders in the 1995 request also bid for the second
round.
   Siwanan said the newly-privatized company sat out the first round to
avoid charges that it would receive preferential treatment from EGAT. As a
result of its first listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in November
1994, Egco is 50% publicly held, 48% controlled by EGAT and 2% is owned by
the Crown Property Bureau.
   The company's second public offering will be held in February or March
of 1996, and Siwanan said the sale would likely decrease EGAT's holdings to
40%. Eventually, EGAT's holdings are expected to decline to 25% or 30%, he
said.

MAHARASHSTRA OKAYS AMENDED PLAN FOR DABHOL PROJECT, NOW 2,450 MW

   The Maharashtra state administration on Jan. 8 approved a reformulated
version of Enron Development's Dabhol Power project, which is now planned
as a 2,450-MW plant.
   Maharashtra officials canceled Dabhol in August on charges of a lack of
transparency in the negotiation process and excessively high costs (IPR, 11
Aug '95, 13). Other project partners are General Electric and International
Generating Co. The state administration is calling for the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board to take a 30% stake.
   An earlier meeting on Jan. 6 convened expressly to decide on the Dabhol
plant and two other private power projects was rendered inconclusive after
``hardliners'' in the cabinet insisted the government ``beat down'' even
further recommendations made by a panel of experts appointed by the state.
   A panel's recommendations, submitted in November, had modified the
Dabhol project profile to reduce the tariff and costs of the project (IPR,
3 Nov '95, 6). The cabinet on Jan. 8 ``unanimously accepted most of them''
and has further modified others, state officials said.
   At the same meeting, the cabinet also approved two other private-sector
power projects, the 410-MW Patalganga project sponsored by India's Reliance
Group and the 595-MW, coal-fired Bhadravati project sponsored by the Ispat
Group.
   One of the key alterations to the panel's recommendations has been the
project's power tariff. The Maharashtra state administration has fixed the
power tariff for the Dabhol project at 5.45 cents/kWh, state officials
said. The expert panel had recommended a tariff of 5.5 cents/kWh.
   Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and his Shiv Sena party chief Bal Thackeray
had called for a tariff of 5.3 cents/kWh. Enron officials last week
indicated to the administration that the project would be commercially
unviable, if the tariff was reduced beyond 5.5 cents/kWh.
   Joshi also indicated that Dabhol Power Co., the project company, and the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the state-owned power utility, would
have to sign a new power-purchase agreement before work could resume at the
site of the stalled project.
   Similarly, the administration decided to accept ``in toto'' the
state-appointed expert panel's recommendation that while the project's
total power-generating capacity should be increased from 2,015 MW to
2,450-MW, project costs should be reduced from the originally approved
$1.3-million/MW to $800,000/MW, amounting to a total reduction of nearly
$300-million in fixed costs.
   This, state power officials pointed out, was lower than that of most
similar power projects being set up elsewhere in India, and the lowest
among those approved in Maharashtra state.
   In addition, the project's internal rate of return would be pegged at
21%, the level recommended by the panel, instead of the earlier 25%,
officials said.
   Joshi said the cabinet also approved the use of naphtha instead of
distillate oil for the first phase of the project, and liquefied natural
gas for the second phase, as in the original plan.
   The cabinet, he added, would expect Enron to take measures to ensure
that ``the environment isn't affected whatever the fuel deployed.''
   It also directed the Maharashtra administration not to allow work to
begin again on the first phase until ``all the necessary approvals,'' both
technical and environmental, have been obtained from the federal government
for both the first and second phases. This is expected to delay the
resumption of work at the project site even further.
   Joshi indicated the administration would not compensate Dabhol Power
``in any way'' for the delays that the project has so far incurred. The
first, 695-MW phase of the project was already under construction when the
newly elected state administration issued a work stoppage notice to Dabhol
Power on Aug. 4, 1995.
   Its subsequent revival was also delayed by nearly a month after the
state administration failed to meet its own self-imposed deadline of Dec.
10 to finalize its decision on the expert panel's recommendations (IPR, 29
Dec '95, 18).
   Dabhol Power had estimated that delays were resulting in cost overruns
of $250,000 a day, and had proposed that they should be shared equally by
the developers and the state administration.
   Chief Minister Joshi indicated on Jan. 8 that the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board would hold 30% of the equity of the Dabhol project.
   This, state officials said, would help MSEB have a say in the crucial
managerial decisions of the project, including the use of indigenous rather
than imported naphtha in order to cut costs, as well as in the case of gas
for the second phase, and project equipment for both phases.
   The equity share for MSEB was among the expert panel's recommendations
for the modified project. However, power industry analysts estimate that
the ``anomalous'' decision by the cabinet to insist on a 30% stake for MSEB
at a time when the federal trend suggests increasing privatization of the
power sector, is expected to cost the state about half of its projected
annual outlays, which could force the state to bring in a private Indian
company as a partner in the deal.
   Joshi said both the state and Enron would ``immediately take the
initiative'' to withdraw arbitration proceedings ongoing in a London court
(IPR, 1 Dec '95, 7). The next hearing had been scheduled for Jan. 15.
   Enron officials would not comment on the arbitration decision, pointing
out that the company had yet to receive a formal notice of the cabinet
approval.
   ``While it would be inappropriate for us to speculate on any conditions
until they are reviewed and considered in their entirety and the extent to
which they compare to the recommendations of the state-appointed expert
committee, we are certainly willing to consider recommendations that
provide for a mutually satisfactory project,'' said Enron officials quoting
from a prepared statement by Kenneth Lay, chairman and chief executive
officer of Enron Corp.

CHINA FORMS NEW AGENCY TO SEPARATE GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE ELECTRIC SECTORS

   China is creating an independent entity, National Power Corp. (NPC), to
separate the functions of government and the private electric sector.
   The Ministry of Power, which will be eliminated as it now functions when
NPC is up and running early this year, said NPC will allow China to step-up
its encouragement of foreign investment in the power sector, particularly
in the electricity-starved Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces and the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui.
   NPC is the first step in a multi-phased program to restructure the
Chinese power industry from central planning to a market economy for
electricity.
   Following completion of the national changes, the same restructuring
will be adopted for regional and provincial power administrations.
   All existing national electric power assets will be placed under the
authority of the Chinese State Council. As it is now known, the Ministry of
Power Industry will be dissolved, with its functions transferred to state
commissions, NPC and the China Electricity Council.
   Independently, the Federation of Chinese Power Enterprises will
coordinate work within the private sector.
   Also, the Chinese note that the new Electric Power Law is before members
of the ongoing 17th session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, for expected
approval in 1996.
   The new electric power laws are designed to encourage more domestic and
international investors in the power industry and correct
``insufficiencies'' in existing Chinese power policy.
   The new laws are intended to make sure all of China's resources be
utilized to produce electricity and encourage investors to use new
technology and equipment to build plants, especially cogeneration units.
Also, provisions call for protecting the rights of all investors, traders
and end-users.
   Use of the new laws will gradually unify the cost of electric power
across China.
   The government has also proposed development of a national 6,000-mile,
high-voltage transmission grid. The grid will expand, connect and control
the movement of electricity between the existing inter-provincial and
regional power grid networks.
   The grid is expected to eventually triple the current Chinese
transmission capacity of about 220,000 MW over a total of 106,000-miles and
will be centered around the Three Gorges hydro project on the Yangtze
River. Distribution networks in 35 key cities will be renovated. The
government wants the national grid in-place and operating by 2003.
   A new national grid company will operate the grid, dictating how excess
generation in one area is moved to areas lacking electricity. Development
of the grid is being handled by the China Electric Power Technology & Trade
Corp. of Beijing.

LAOS MAY ALLOW CHINA-THAI LINE IN COUNTRY FOR 1,500-MW PROJECT

   The Laotian government has indicated it may allow a transmission line
linking a 1,500-MW hydro project in China's Yunnan province with Thailand,
to be built on Laotian territory.
   Securing a third-country route for the transmission line is critical for
the project, which is now in the feasibility study stage, since China and
Thailand have no common land border and the project is envisioned to supply
Thailand. Thai officials have expressed concern that building the line
through Myanmar carries too many risks.
   In exchange for opening its territory to the line, Laos, which seeks to
be a major supplier of Thailand's booming energy market, has asked that
some of the power be used to supply Laotian towns and villages near the
line.
   During a meeting of Chinese, Laotian and Thai officials last month at
the ``Electric Power Forum,'' an Asian Development Bank-sponsored event,
Laotian officials agreed in principle to a study on constructing the power
transmission line through Laotian territory.
   Somboune Manolom, deputy director of the Laos Electricity Dept., said
Laos has no objection to the transmission line study, and suggested the
project could boost subregional cooperation.
   The feasibility study for the hydro plant is being conducted under a
joint venture by MDX Power of Bangkok, Thailand, and the Yunnan Electric
Power Bureau, which hold 48% and 52%, respectively. The plant study is
expected to be completed in late-1997.
   The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand has not yet committed
to purchase power from the project.
   One EGAT source said it is too early to know if the project will be
attractive. And a another EGAT official questioned whether the project
would offer energy at a competitive price, given the cost of transporting
power 185 miles from the northern Thai border. EGAT has no existing
agreements to buy power from China.
   But an MDX source said the company is pursuing the effort on the
``fairly strong belief that the project will be economically feasible and
mutually beneficial for the two countries.'' The transmission line is
unlikely to make up a major share of the project cost, he said.
   While MDX and Thai officials say that a Myanmar route for the
transmission line remains an option, Piyasvasti Amranand, head of
Thailand's National Energy Policy Office said it is ``too risky for us''
because the line would go through areas controlled by rebel groups. Also,
he said, some international lenders are reluctant to finance projects in
Myanmar.

SCEPTRE, PARTNERS TO REPOWER TWO SMALL PLANTS IN CHINA; MORE PLANNED

   Sceptre Power Co. of Santa Anna, Calif., has launched a joint venture to
repower two existing units totaling 42 MW in Jiangsu Province, China, with
hopes of repowering much larger plants in the future.
   With project partners New China Hong Kong Group Ltd. of Hong Kong and
Horizon Energy Development Inc., a unit of National Fuel Gas Co. of
Buffalo, N.Y., the 27-MW, coal-fired Wuxian Leekou plant will be expanded
to 39 MW and the 15-MW, coal-fired Jiangyin Sanfangxiang plant will be
increased to 24 MW. Combined costs of both projects are put at
$35.5-million.
   NCHK will hold about 50% of the project, while Sceptre Power and Horizon
Energy will hold the other 50%.
   Sceptre vice president for Asian project development L.W. Ken Kinnie
said both projects are scheduled to reach financial close during the first
quarter of this year and be complete by year-end.
   ``These projects are just to get our feet wet in China,'' Kinnie said.
Sceptre's goal in China is to undertake 10 to 15 similar repowering
projects--although the later ones will be larger--then list the entire
portfolio on the stock exchange of either Hong Kong or China.
   The company expects to have partners in each of the Chinese
undertakings.
   Sceptre began as an affiliate of Canada's Sceptre Resources, but
recently became independent. The company holds several agreements in China
for projects similar to those in Jiangsu Province, but Kinnie said details
will not be released until the project development process is more
advanced.
   The company is searching for other joint venture partners, Kinnie said.
   In a separate joint venture in Pakistan, Sceptre Power is nearing
financial close on a 157-MW, gas-fired project in Lahore (IPR, 29 Dec '95,
5). Partners in that project include Pakistan's Fauji Foundation and Intrag
of Wellesley, Mass.
   Other projects are sought in Brazil, Peru and elsewhere in South
America.

KEY PHILIPPINE SENATOR WANTS PROBE OF LINE DELAYS AFFECTING CEPA PLANT

   The president of the Philippine Senate said Monday he wants a probe on
why state-run National Power Corp. (Napocor) failed to provide needed
transmission lines, leading to delays in operation of two completed power
plants, including one built by Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA) of
Hong Kong, a unit of Hopewell Holdings.
   The plants involved are the 700-MW, coal-fired Pagbilao facility built
by CEPA, and the 300-MW Calaca coal plant owned by Napocor, both completed
in 1995.
   Senate President Neptali Gonzalez said the government has so far
incurred losses of $891.69-million due to the continued non-operation of
the two coal-fired facilities.
   Gonzalez filed a Senate resolution calling for an investigation on
``whether or not there is gross negligence or incompetence on the part of
the National Power Corporation...due to the delay in the construction of
the transmission lines and substations.''
   The two power plants ``were installed and commissioned as scheduled but
remain idle and inoperational due to unavailable transmission lines and
substations,'' Gonzalez said.
   However, Napocor vice president for projects management Antonio Corpuz
previously said that under a contract signed with CEPA, the transmission
lines needed for the Pagbilao plant should be ready by March 1996, at the
latest.
   Corpuz also said then that Napocor will not pay a single cent of the
$26.34-million being claimed by CEPA as an early completion bonus of
Pagbilao (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   A CEPA source said the ``misunderstanding'' with Napocor is being
discussed by both sides, and that the issue will be resolved ``very
soon.''

PHILIPPINES' NAPOCOR MAY SELL TWO WESTINGHOUSE TURBINES TO TEXACO

   The Philippines' National Power Corp. (Napocor) said Monday it may sell
to Texaco Inc. the two gas turbines totaling 320 MW to be delivered by
Westinghouse in 1997 as part of a package that settled a nuclear plant
dispute (IPR, 29 Dec '95, 18; 15 Dec '95, 10).
   The two new 501F combustion turbines worth $30-million each could be
used by Texaco for a 300-MW cogeneration plant planned in Batangas
province, south of Manila, said Napocor spokeswoman Jane Subang.
   Texaco officials were unavailable for comment.
   Westinghouse had been accused of bribing former president Ferdinand
Marcos in the early-1980s to secure the contract to build the allegedly
faulty nuclear plant in Bataan province, west of Manila.
   Westinghouse equipment and technology were banned in 1993 after talks on
a settlement failed. A $100-million out-of-court settlement that included
the delivery of the two gas turbines was reached recently paving the way
for the lifting of the ban.
   The sale of the gas turbines to Texaco has not yet been finalized,
Subang said. It is also possible the two turbines could be made part of the
planned bidding for a 1,200-MW gas-fired plant, she said (IPR, 15 Dec '95,
10).

PHILIPPINE INVESTMENT BOARD GRANTS INCENTIVES FOR TWO PROJECTS, 160 MW

   The Philippine government investment board has granted tax incentives to
two proposed geothermal projects totaling 160 MW that state-run Philippine
National Oil Co. plans to turn over to the private sector.
   The incentives, which include tax holidays and low duties on imported
equipment, were granted to draw the attention of private investors in the
proposed projects, the investment board said.
   The projects are the 120-MW Mount Labo geothermal plant in Camarines Sur
province, south of Manila, and the 40-MW Negros Geothermal Project in the
central province of Negros Occidental, said PNOC spokeswoman Debbie
Diokno.
   PNOC has not yet decided whether to offer the two projects to investors
on a build-operate-transfer or build-own-operate basis, she said.
   It is also eyeing the Japanese government's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund as a source of funding for both projects, Diokno said.
   The Mount Labo project will be implemented in two phases: a 20-MW
facility scheduled for operation by June 1998, and a 100-MW unit by March
2000.
   The Negros power plant is scheduled for commissioning by August 1998.
   The government's investment board gave ``pioneer status'' to both
projects, entitling their proponents to a six-year income tax holiday, a 3%
duty on imported capital equipment and tax credits on local purchases of
machinery.

SOUTH KOREA LIFTS 750-MW SIZE CAP; 1,600-MW RFP NOW SEEN IN FEBRUARY

   South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) has lifted
its earlier 750-MW private power project size limit, effective immediately
(IPR, 6 Oct '95, 12).
   The timing of the change coincides with the release of an often-delayed
international solicitation to be issued by Korea Electric Power Corp.
(KEPCO) in February for two 800-MW thermal projects, Younghungdong units 1
and 2, which will be developed on a build-own-operate basis.
   The formal request for proposals was expected before the end of 1995,
but was delayed. The RFP was originally scheduled to be released in June
1995. All delays were blamed on personnel changes at the top of MOTIE.
   The cost of each 800 MW is placed between $650-million and
$700-million.
   The policy change means the only restriction faced by private power
developers is a 50% limitation on foreign ownership. Also, nuclear projects
are barred.
   According to a tentative schedule, MOTIE will receive and evaluate
proposals in early-1996 with selection of developers set for July 1996.
Power-purchase agreements will be signed in August 1996, following
negotiations. Development of selected projects will begin in September
1996.
   Those dates could slip into the future.
   Virtually all private companies will be able to compete for the
projects, if the ratio of their net worth to capital during the previous
three years is at least 20% and they have some technical capacity for power
projects.
   KEPCO may not bid for the projects, but will buy the power under a
long-term, power-purchase agreement. Power-purchase negotiations will be
between the selected bidders and KEPCO, which is warning prospective
bidders it will not pay a tariff higher than the cost of power from the
utility's comparable existing plants.
   Successful bidders will be guaranteed returns of 11%, compared to the 9%
guaranteed to KEPCO.
   Separate successful bidders will be selected for each project, and the
same company will not be allowed to participate in both generating plants.
South Korea's largest and most powerful industrial groups are expected to
offer strong competition for the projects.
   Further solicitations after the two 800-MW plants are almost certain
because electricity demand in South Korea is projected to average 5.5%
between 1996 and 2006.
   Currently, installed capacity in South Korea is about 31,810 MW, with
30,188 MW generated by KEPCO. About 62% is fueled by oil, coal or natural
gas, 28.7% is nuclear power and 9.3% is hydroelectric.

QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, ENCOURAGING BAGASSE PLANTS UNDER NEW PROGRAM

   Queensland, Australia, is promoting bagasse-fired, waste-to-energy
cogeneration plants among the state's sugar mills and is encouraging
domestic and international joint venture partners.
   Under the just-created Queensland Sugar Power Pool Agreement, power
produced by using the waste products of making sugar will be purchased at
special tariffs under a long-term agreement by the Queensland Transmission
& Supply Corp. (QT&SC) starting January 1998.
   Up to 95 MW will be purchased by (QT&SC) when the program begins, but by
2002, the limit will increase to 200 MW, said Queensland energy minister
Tony McGrady.
   The mills will make use of the thermal energy created by the
cogeneration units, but only a very small portion of the electric
generation.
   The program is an effort by the government to explore ``all avenues of
environmentally friendly generation options,'' McGrady said.
   The effort is expected to generate worldwide interest, the government
said, and various private sector companies are welcome to participate, if
they can strike a deal with one of the sugar mills agreeing to provide
fuel.
   So far, sugar mills participating in the project include the three CSR
Ltd. mills located at Invicta, Kalamia and Inkerman and the mills of South
Johnstone and Maryborough. The mills are the initial members of the
Queensland Sugar Power Pool Agreement, but others are expected to join.
   Bagasse is the part of the cane stalk remaining after the milling
process.

NATIONAL POWER, POWERGEN MAY FACE MORE AGENCY-ORDERED PLANT SELL-OFFS

   U.K. generation companies National Power and PowerGen may be forced to
sell additional plants beyond the already-required 6,000 MW, if their
pending acquisitions of regional electric companies (RECs) are cleared.
   PowerGen has bid to acquire Midlands Electricity (IPR, 22 Sept '95, 1)
and National Power has proposed buying Southern Electric (IPR, 6 Oct '95,
13). Both bids, accepted by the RECs, have been referred to the Monopolies
& Mergers Commission (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 17). A decision is expected by March
22.
   London Electricity is pressing industry regulator Stephen Littlechild,
director of the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER), for a reduction
in the generating capacity of PowerGen and National Power.
   According to a London Electricity spokesman, there is considerable
concern at the size and potential market share of the vertically integrated
groups. ``We are not against vertical integration,'' he said, ``but it must
not be at the expense of stifling other suppliers. We would like to see
more generators and suppliers rather than less, which may happen if these
mergers go ahead.''
   PowerGen is already disposing of 2,000 MW of capacity to the Eastern
Group, while National Power is evaluating bids from Enron, AES Corp.,
Eastern Group and Mission Energy for the 2,000-MW plant at West Burton in
Nottinghamshire and two, 1,000-MW plants at Ironbridge in Shropsire and
Rugeley in Staffordshire (IPR, 22 Sept '95, 8; 6 Oct '95, 1).
   National Power forecasts its transaction will be complete by March 31.
All four bidders want to acquire the three plants, but it is possible they
will be sold separately to individual bidders.
   However, London Electricity said further sales are necessary to enable
more players to enter the market, although the two generators point to
their decline in market share since privatization and insist that further
sales are unnecessary.
   The RECs are also concerned about the possible effects on the power
pool. Southeast distributor Seeboard said the workings of the pool should
be scrutinized along with other commercial issues and the voting structure
to ensure that bigger groups do not dominate the market.

UKRAINE GETS $1.8-BILLION WESTERN AID FOR POWER; BIG ABB PROJECT DEAD

   A protocol signed by the Ukraine and the ``G-7'' Western industrial
nations in Ottawa commits the West to provide $1.8-billion in loans for
power plant construction and rehabilitation projects in the Ukraine in
return for closure of 3,000 MW of remaining nuclear capacity at the
Chernobyl site by 2000.
   The west will also contribute $498-million towards Chernobyl cleanup and
decommissioning costs.
   The protocol calls for much of the replacement power funding to be spent
on completion of two 1,000-MW reactors at Khmelnitsky and Rovno and the
rest to go into thermal and hydro plant rehabilitation, pumped-storage
projects and energy conservation.
   The agreement to fund the nuclear plants officially ends chances for
construction at this time of a 2,300-MW, gas-fired combustion turbine
project near the Chernobyl site that was proposed in May 1995 by a
consortium led by Asea Brown Boveri (IPR, 16 June '95, 18).
   The ABB group also included CMS Generation, Kawasaki, Skanska AB of
Sweden, Mannesmananlangebau of Germany and Danish Power as well as local
Ukranian groups.
   The group proposed a crash construction schedule, which would allow the
project to start generating power within 24 months of construction start
and be fully completed within 36 months. They said this would be the best
way to insure new power supplies in time for the closure deadline of 2000.
   However, the project met stiff resistance inside the Ukraine from
supporters of nuclear power and the national utility Minenergo. Critics
argued the country could not afford the cost of gas from Russia that would
be needed to fuel the plant. The Ukraine has had chronic problems paying
Russia for both gas and power supplies in recent years.
   The gas project also was based on initial estimates the west would
provide up to $4-billion for the Chernobyl cleanup and replacement power
projects. However, as talks continued during 1995, it became clear the west
was not willing to commit to such a large sum.
   An ABB spokesman in Zurich said the gas project clearly now had a ``low
priority'' in Ukrainian planning and that his company was looking at
participation in various plant rehabilitation projects. Siemens of Germany
has already been active in promoting such projects and it is possible ABB
will team with Siemens.
   The European Community has already funded a study by Electricite de
France, Tractebel Engineering and IVO of Finland on what will be needed to
complete work on the two nuclear plants.
   The Dec. 20, 1995, protocol also contains language committing the
Ukraine to continue developing a ``financially sound electric power market
with market-based pricing'' that will encourage energy conservation and
attract international investment.

U.K.'S NATIONAL POWER PLANS 60-MW PROJECT IN UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

   The U.K.'s National Power has signed a memorandum of understanding with
Ajman, a sheikdom operating as part of the federation of United Arab
Emirates (UAE), to build, own and operate a $120-million, 50-MW to 60-MW,
desalination and power plant.
   National Power will hold a 49% equity stake in the project, while a
domestic partner, Bin Sofan Trading Co., is expected to hold 51%.
   When complete, the project will also produce about 5-million gallons/day
of desalinated sea water.
   The project is considered the first private power plant in the UAE and
the first power project in Ajman.
   National Power is holding power-purchase agreement negotiations with the
UAE's Ministry of Electricity & Water. The agency is responsible for
electricity supplies in some of the UAE's northern emirates, including
Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Quwain.
   Within the UAE, the Abu Dhabi Dept. of Water & Electricity, the Dubai
Electricity & Water Authority, and the Sharjah Water & Electricity
Department supply power to their respective areas.
   UAE power demand is projected to increase to 6,900 MW by 1999, based on
load growth of about 20% annually. Current installed capacity is about
4,350 MW, produced by six gas-fired power stations and seven small
generating units.
   About 1,440 MW of government-owned projects are in some stage of
construction. Many of the planned projects are associated with desalination
plants.
   Also, the Ministry of Electricity & Water and the Dubai Electricity &
Water Authority are separately evaluating prospects for several more
projects, totaling about 710 MW.
   Within the UAE, the government is planning a large expansion of
liquefied natural gas production and transportation facilities. The
expansion, estimated to cost about $3-billion, will be undertaken by the
Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Co..
   The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven small semi-autonomous
principalities located on the Persian Gulf.

MET-ED MAY PAY UP TO $35-MILLION TO KILL 227-MW AIR PRODUCTS PACT

   Air Products & Chemicals of Allentown, Pa., has ended talks with
Metropolitan Edison aimed at restructuring the contract for a planned
227-MW coal project (IPR, 6 Oct '95, 7).
   After three months, the companies could not agree on new terms and will
now negotiate a buyout that could reach $35-million to cover Air Products'
development costs.
   To replace the capacity and 100 MW from another recent buyout, Met-Ed
may seek new supplies, a spokesman said.
   Air Products was pursuing the project strictly as a developer, and would
have operated it at the site of the P.H. Glatfelter paper company in York
County, selling steam to the mill and power to Met-Ed, a unit of General
Public Utilities.
   Although Air Products worked alone, the project was being developed
under the name York County Energy Partners L.P., because it planned to seek
limited partners once the plant was operational.
   According to Brad Hahn, Air Products director of business development,
the company completed all of the design work and had received an air permit
from the Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection, as well as a
favorable environmental impact statement (EIS) from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
   He could not estimate how much the company spent on development costs,
but said it would be covered by the final buyout figure.
   When the parties began talking in September, Met-Ed estimated the
existing contract would cost $940-million above market rates during its
25-year term. It proposed that Air Products switch its design from coal to
gas, since that would reduce capacity rates.
   The utility also offered to let the developer participate in GPU's new
gas pool, which was developed for utility peakers, but is being made
available to non-utility generators who agree to renegotiate contracts.
   However, ``it became clear that we would not be able to agree,'' Hahn
told Independent Power Report. The main sticking point was contract length,
since Met-Ed wanted only eight to 10 years, while Air Products preferred a
term closer to the original 25 years. Other details also blocked the
agreement, he added.
   A Met-Ed spokesman said the utility will begin considering alternatives
to replace the 227 MW, as well as the 100 MW it lost when it bought out the
Crown/Vista coal contact from partners Mission Energy, Ahlstrom Development
and Entergy Power Development for $30-million (IPR, 8 Sept '95, 5).
   Met-Ed agreed to that buyout because it saw the contract costing
$298-million over market rates during its 20-year life.
   The spokesman did not say whether Met-Ed would seek bids for new
supplies.
   Air Products & Chemicals has equity stakes of 176 MW in seven operating
plants that produce 303 MW, including three in-house projects. The firm
also has four projects in development, representing about 650 MW to 725 MW,
including a coal gasification plant in the Czech Republic that is currently
on hold.

PANDA TO REFILE LAWSUIT CHARGING FLA. POWER BLOCKED 115-MW PROJECT

   Panda Energy, after voluntarily withdrawing its $345-million federal
suit against Florida Power without prejudice in mid-December, said it will
file the suit again (Case No. 95-992-CIV-T-24 C) (IPR, 11 Aug '95, 1).
   The suit alleged the utility unfairly interfered with construction of a
115-MW cogeneration plant in Polk County, which was to supply Florida Power
with 74.9 MW of firm power under a standard-offer contract.
   Florida Power has since filed a countersuit against Panda in the same
court, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division
(Case No. 95-2145-CIV-T-25-B). In addition, the state Public Service
Commission denied two requests made by Panda in a related action.
   Panda's general counsel Bill Nordlund said the withdrawal was a
strategic move, ``and we still plan to prosecute this matter and move
forward on it. I can't comment on when or what court. We don't want to give
an advance of our intentions to the other side.''
   The countersuit filed by Florida Power at the end of December sought
declaratory judgments against the facts alleged in Panda's suit, which was
a safeguard in case Panda refiled the case, according to Florida Power
attorney James Fama.
   Florida Power asked the court to issue declaratory judgments ruling
that:
   Panda did not have a superior legal right to negotiate for a natural gas
transmission contract with the city of Lakeland, and that the utility did
not interfere with Panda's rights with the city;
   Panda was not entitled to a standard-offer contract if it builds a unit
larger than 75 MW, the largest allowed under PSC rules;
   Panda was not entitled to rates under a standard-offer contract beyond
December 2016, rather than 2026 as Panda sought;
   Panda breached its contract by failing to begin construction on the
unit, which was scheduled to go on line in January 1997;
   The utility also asked the court to declare remedies to Florida Power
from Panda's breach, plus additional relief.
   On Jan. 3, the PSC refused to reconsider a decision the PSC made on Dec.
5, which said the PSC had jurisdiction over standard-offer contracts and
the Florida Power/Panda dispute. It also refused to grant Panda a 90-day
extension beyond Jan. 5 to file testimony in that case (Docket No.
950110-EI).
   As a result, a hearing at the PSC was scheduled for Feb. 19, a staff
recommendation was due April 18, and the commission was scheduled to vote
on April 30.
   Nordlund said Panda made the deadline for filing testimony Jan. 5, and
added, ``We think Florida Power's suit is ludicrous.''

ENERGY INITIATIVES BEATS FLA. POWER IN COURT ON RATES FOR 112-MW PLANT

   Energy Initiatives Inc. won a partial summary judgment Jan. 4 in a case
against Florida Power concerning rates for the developer's 112-MW
cogeneration plant in Umatilla, Fla.
   The project company, Lake Cogen, said the utility was paying it on an
as-available basis at times when it should have been paying for firm
capacity and energy.
   Florida Power attorney James Fama confirmed two other non-utility
generators, Pasco Cogen, also 112 MW and owned by Energy Initiatives, and
the 120-MW Orlando Cogen, developed by Air Products & Chemicals, have
similar court actions pending.
   The Lake Cogen case, filed in state circuit court in Lake County, will
determine whether firm capacity payments should be made based on a model
used by Florida Power, or a separate method Lake Cogen said was called for
in the contract (Case No. 94354 CA-01, Division 8).
   Florida Power pays NUGs both capacity and energy payments when the
theoretically avoided generating unit would operate, but only as-available
or energy payments if the avoided unit would have been off line.
   Florida Power claimed a theoretically avoided 500-MW pulverized coal
plant equipped with a scrubber, which was used to determine capacity and
energy payments, would be used by the utility based on four criteria to
determine when the plant would be dispatched on an economic basis.
   The four parameters were the cost of variable operations and
maintenance, the price of coal, the heat rate of the unit, and a fuel
multiplier of 1, the last of which Fama said was not a significant factor.
   In its motion, Lake Cogen contended other factors, such as environmental
compliance, should be used in determining economic dispatchability of a
generating unit. It said an actual, operating plant should be used for
comparison, which would be Florida Power's coal-fired Crystal River units 1
and 2.
   Judge Don Briggs ruled the parameters for dispatchability should be
based on a real unit and not only the four Florida Power was using. He
ordered a more accurate model be developed, which would be used to
determine how much Lake Cogen should be paid.
   That cost information will be compared to actual payments, which could
be used to determine an award at a later date, assuming the model shows
Lake Cogen was underpaid. A schedule for further proceedings was not set.
   Kelly Tomblin, legal director for Energy Initiatives, a unit of General
Public Utilities, said Florida Power changed the method of payment in
August 1994. Although the developer receives payments for firm capacity and
as-available sales, firm capacity payments ``have been very limited
recently,'' she said.
   ``We believe Florida Power always believed it would be based on a real
operating unit and the judge agreed,'' Tomblin said. ``We think it is good
for cogenerators and good for us in Florida.''
   Tomblin said it would be very difficult to estimate the amount of
damages Florida Power might have to pay until after the judge approves the
final modeling and makes a ruling.

NIMO: PURPA PREEMPTS NEW YORK LAW REQUIRING TAX REIMBURSEMENT TO QFS

   Niagara Mohawk Power has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to act against a New York State law that requires NiMo to pay natural gas
tax reimbursements to qualifying facilities.
   NiMo has paid almost $18-million in reimbursements since the law was
passed in 1991, it said.
   The company wants FERC to bring an enforcement action against the New
York Public Service Commission to bar it from implementing the law, which
directs the PSC to order utilities to reimburse QFs for natural gas import
tax payments that the state requires QFs to pay on fuel used to generate
power sold to the utilities.
   According to NiMo, the state law is preempted by the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act and FERC's PURPA rules. ``The PSC cannot both obey
the New York statute and heed its obligations under Sec. 210 of PURPA,''
NiMo said (Docket No. EL96-26).
   The legislature imposed a monthly ``privilege tax'' on certain gas
importers amounting to 4.25% of the price paid for gas imported into the
state for use or consumption. For cogenerators, the amount of gas taxed is
that used in producing power for sale to utilities, not the gas used to
produce power or steam for steam hosts.
   Utilities may pass the payments through in fuel cost adjustments.
   NiMo itself paid about $7.2-million in 1994 and $4.8-million in 1995
through Sept. 30. The company projected it will pay between $7.2-million in
1996 and $13.5-million in 2006.
   FERC's 1995 rulings in cases involving Connecticut Power & Light (IPR,
27 Jan '95, 10) and Southern California Edison (IPR, 24 March '95, 4)
``leave no room for doubt that this New York statute is preempted'' because
it requires utilities to pay above avoided-cost rates to QFs, NiMo said
(IPR, 21 April '95, 1; 24 March '95, 1).

N.Y. JUDGE SEES ISO AS KEY IN MOVE TO WHOLESALE COMPETITION, ACCESS

   An administrative law judge has recommended New York set up an
independent system operator to formalize wholesale competition and ensure a
smooth transition to retail competition.
   Her recommended decision in the state's Competitive Opportunities
proceeding also calls for separating transmission and distribution from
generation and for recovering stranded costs with an access charge imposed
by a distribution company.
   Administrative law judge Judith Lee of the state's Dept. of Public
Service filed her recommendation Dec. 22 with Ronald Liberty, deputy
director for the Energy and Water Division. Subject to review by the Public
Service Commission, it aims to lower New York's high electricity rates and
keep industry in the state.
   Key parts of the more than 200-page review are:
   -- Stranded costs ``may be made unrecoverable by the transition from
regulation to a competitive market for electricity.'' These costs could be
recovered by a separate mechanism outside the market, such as a
non-bypassable access charge or wires charge imposed by a distribution
company.
   -- Transmission and distribution should be separate from generation
``to limit the exercise of market power,'' and T&D companies will need to
serve all would-be buyers in the short term.
   Lee said she saw as ``critical'' the reliability of the bulk power
system, noting that it should not be sacrificed in any way to achieve the
potential price reduction that may be associated with a system of retail
access. Therefore, ``effective competition at the wholesale level should be
established first, with an eye toward adding retail access as rapidly as
possible once a market is established and reliability is ensured.''
   No timetable for the ``as rapidly as possible'' transition to retail
access is available, a PSC spokesperson told Independent Power Report.
   Lee's recommendation was a ``tremendous disappointment'' to New York
industrials ``and to any advocate of full and open retail competition,''
said Barbara Brenner, counsel to Multiple Interveners, the industrial users
group. ``It delays, without schedule, retail competition and, in fact,
appears to delay even the implementation of wholesale competition for two
years.''

PACIFIC GENERATION BUYS 25% INTEREST IN 100-MW ONTARIO PLANT FROM DESTEC

   Pacific Generation, a unit of PacifiCorp, has acquired a 25% interest in
the 100-MW Kingston cogeneration project under construction in Ontario,
Canada, from Destec Energy Inc.
   Destec retains 50% ownership in the gas-fired project, located in
Ernestown Township. The plant will supply power to the Ontario Hydro grid
and process heat to Celanese Canada's Millhaven polyester plant.
   PanCanadian Petroleum holds the remaining 25% interest and will supply
natural gas to the plant, which will enter service in late-1996.
   Pacific Generation and Destec are already partners in the
almost-completed 240-MW Crockett cogeneration plant near San Francisco,
which will begin operation in April. Other partners are Tomen Power and
Energy Investors Fund. Pacific Gas & Electric will buy the power.
   ``The Kingston project fits our plan for growing our business through
acquisition of existing facilities and the development of new power
projects,'' said John Miller, Pacific Generation president and chief
executive officer.
   In October, Miller had said that after several years of being in a
``holding pattern,'' his company intended to aggressively expand its
independent power activities (IPR, 6 Oct '95, 14). In November, the company
said it was beefing up its top management by hiring five people for
domestic and international expansion (IPR, 17 Nov '95, 3).
   The company, based in Portland, Ore., was formed in 1989 with the merger
of Pacific Power & Light and Utah Power & Light. Ownership and operating
interests of projects developed by Pacific P&L affiliate Onsite Energy Inc.
and UP&L affiliate Energy National Inc. were transferred to Pacific
Generation.
   Pacific Generation holds an interest in 11 power plants in the U.S.
totaling 703 MW. Destec has equity in 19 operating plants totaling 2,810 MW
and has seven projects with over 1,700 MW in construction or advanced
development.

MISSION FORMALLY EXITS 400-MW PROJECT AT WEYERHAEUSER MILL IN WASH. STATE

   Weyerhaeuser Co. of Longview, Wash., and Mission Energy told Washington
state regulators they have reached a stipulated agreement over development
of a 400-MW, gas-fired cogeneration plant, that would give Weyco full
rights to develop the plant alone at its Longview paper mill (IPR, 1 Dec
'95, 13; 29 Jan '93, 1).
   Weyco asked the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council to amend its
certification agreement to reflect its decision to proceed alone.
   It also asked for an amendment that would extend the agreement for 18
months.
   EFSEC will make a decision in February on the request. If the council
approves the deal, ``we will require the governor to sign the new
agreement,'' said Jason Zeller, EFSEC manager.
   Zeller said the two companies reached a stipulated pact after being
pressured by EFSEC to resolve their differences on their own. ``We were
unhappy'' that the companies had been unable to settle their dispute over
the development of the project, he said. The original permit expired in
August.
   Weyco officials indicated to the council they were still interested in
developing the plant eventually, even though the company recently agreed to
purchase 150 MW from the Bonneville Power Administration to cover part of
its 300-MW load at the Longview mill.

AES, ONTARIO HYDRO UNIT IN TALKS TO BUY 2,700-MW ARGENTINE PLANT

   A strategic alliance of Ontario Hydro International, a unit of Ontario
Hydro, and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has opened talks with the
government of Argentina concerning the acquisition of the 2,700-MW Yacyreta
hydro project, now under construction on the Parana River, which forms the
border between Argentina and Paraguay.
   Other unidentified developers have also opened discussions on the
project, jointly owned by the governments of Argentina and Paraguay.
   Previously, an international solicitation was scheduled for release in
August 1995, but was not issued (IPR, 30 June '95, 1).
   Analysts said it is unlikely Ontario Hydro and AES could acquire the
plant via a negotiations, and would more likely have to compete in an
international solicitation open to all.
   The project consists of 20 turbines of 135 MW each.
   Officials of Ontario Hydro International and AES met recently with
Argentine government officials about the project.
   Ontario Hydro officials said it and AES may form a consortium to enter a
bid for Yacyreta when and if it is offered via a solicitation.
   Both companies have equity in other South American electric projects.
   The plant will be completed by the middle of 1998.
   Argentine officials confirmed representatives of the two companies met
with energy officials, but nothing substantive came of the meeting.
Meetings with other private developers are taking place.
   Separately, a consortium known as LISTA will build and operate a
transmission system to move power generated by the Yacyreta plant.
   LISTA consists of Jose Cartellone Construcciones Civiles SA
(Cartellone), Sideco Americana SA (Sidecdeco), Italy's Impresa Frate SpA.
(Frate), Pirelli Consultora Conductores e Instalaciones SA (Pirelli),
Construccion Obras de Ingenieria SA (Codi), and Electroingenieria SA.

TAIWAN FIRM PROPOSES 1,010-MW BOT HYDRO PROJECT IN HONDURAS

   Oslow Associates Ltd. of Taiwan has proposed to the government of
Honduras development of a $2-billion, 1,010-MW hydroelectric project on a
build-operate-transfer basis.
   Oslow, a large trading company based in Taiwan, submitted the proposal
following a government trade mission to Honduras.
   The Honduran government tentatively accepted the proposal, pending
completion of a number of subsequent agreements.
   The project will be financed through government-backed loans in Taiwan
and with funds from foreign banks.
   Additional equity partners are expected to be involved in the project,
but none have been identified, Honduran officials said.
   Load growth is high in Honduras, but the country is relatively small.
Installed capacity--two-thirds hydro--is less than 600 MW. Honduras is said
to have an estimated untapped hydro potential of about 3,600 MW.
   Overall, up to 800 MW could be available to the private sector in
Honduras by 1999.
   If the 1,010-MW hydro project is completed, it could export power to
other countries in Central America via the 1,100-mile, high-tension
transmission grid known as the Electricity Interconnection System for
Central America, now in development.
   The Inter-American Development Bank is expected to eventually provide a
$157-million syndicated loan to partially finance the transmission grid.
   The government of Taiwan also agreed to provide undisclosed financing
for the transmission project, which would allow each country to supply or
buy electricity from all others, and serve as an emergency electric supply
backup.
   Recently, Mosbacher Power Group (MPG) of Houston launched pursuit of
smaller independent power projects in Honduras, mostly within the
industrial power niche for projects between 20 MW and 50 MW (IPR, 17 Nov
'95, 16).

SPAIN'S ENDESA SELLS 9.7% OF EDENOR IN ARGENTINA FOR ABOUT $76-MILLION

   Spanish electric utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA (Endesa)
said its Endesa Group sold a 9.7% stake in Argentine electricity
distribution company Edenor to Banco Santander de Negocios for about (U.S.)
$76-million.
   Less than two weeks earlier, Endesa paid $156-million to expand its
equity stake in Edenor by 19.5 percentage points, pushing total holdings to
31% (IPR, 29 Dec '95, 12). Endesa bought that piece of Edenor from the
Argentine government.
   Endesa said the sale to Banco Santander de Negocios was made for
financial reasons.
   Endesa said it will maintain its 21.3% holdings in Edenor with joint
venture partners, Astra CAPSA of Argentina, Electricite de France, Societe
D'Amenagement Urbain et Rural of France, Empresa Nacional Hidroelectrica
Ribargozana of Spain, and J.P. Morgan.
   Endesa officials said the company remains strongly interested in
additional equity roles in Latin American electricity projects.
