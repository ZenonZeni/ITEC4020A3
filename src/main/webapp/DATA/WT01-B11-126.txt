<B>Red And White Pine In Ontario<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Ontario has almost 4 million hectares of red and white pine, with a concentration ranging from 10 per cent to more than 40 per cent on any given stand.  This includes red and white pine in protected areas, conservation reserves and areas available for logging.<P>

Forest areas where red and white pine are the dominant species (40 per cent or more of all species present on any given stand), cover 723,658 ha.<P>

In forest areas where red and white pine dominate, more than 124,000 ha are classified as old red and white pine.  In these areas, MNR policy on the conservation of old growth pine will ensure that red and white pine forest ecosystems, including old growth stands, are present on the landscape now and in the future.<P>

To qualify as red and white pine old growth, a forest must meet certain criteria including the presence of old trees, associated trees and other plants, and little or no traces of activities such as logging.<P>

MNR has protected 66,000 ha of old growth red and white pine - 46,000 ha in provincial parks and conservation reserves, and 20,000 ha in no-cut reserves in forest management areas.  The following table shows the total area of red 
and white pine forests older than 120 years that are protected in Ontario:<P>

</TABLE><P>
This protection of red and white pine across its range includes 16,345 ha of old growth red and white pine forest in Quetico Wilderness Park in Northwestern Ontario, and in the Southcentral Region, 955 ha as part of 11,250 ha of protected red and white pine 81 years and older in Algonquin Park.<P>

 Of the total 66,000 ha area, nearly 11,000 ha is old growth red and white pine that is protected in the Temagami area.  A citizens committee, the Comprehensive Planning Council (CPC), recommended that the government protect 12 old growth red and white pine sites in Temagami.  The government accepted the CPC's recommendations on old growth.<P>
<B>Protection and Regeneration</B><P>
MNR has adopted a <I>Conservation Strategy For Old Growth Red and White Pine Ecosystems in Ontario</I>.  It commits MNR to protecting representative areas of old growth red and white pine forests to allow those areas to evolve through natural ecological processes.<P>
A key feature of MNR's conservation strategy is to leave healthy old trees (120 years and older), snags (standing dead trees), dying and rotting trees on red and white pine sites after logging.  MNR's goal is to ensure that a range of ages from young to old red and white pine trees are left in areas across the forested landscape.<P>
Where possible, protected areas will be surrounded by young red and white pine forest, so that the full range of ages is maintained to replace old growth in protected areas that change as a result of successional pressures such as wildfire and individual tree mortality.<P>
To ensure genetic conservation, natural regeneration, and wildlife habitat protection in red and white pine forests, MNR will leave healthy, mature seed trees in the harvested area, including some of the straightest and oldest, as well as dead and dying trees.  In addition, tree tops and limbs of harvested trees are left on the forest floor to provide wildlife habitat.<P>
In addition to protection and regeneration, the conservation strategy identifies other goals:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ensuring that in a stand where it is the dominant species, red and white pine will be maintained.<P>
<LI>Ensuring that red and white pine areas are not reduced to less than current levels.<P>
<LI>Restoring red and white pine areas, guided by historical records, within the bounds of silvicultural funding at the management unit level.<P>
<LI>Ensuring an age distribution that maintains old red and white pine stands in areas across the forested landscape.<P>
<LI>Providing a sustainable supply of red and white pine to the forest industry.
