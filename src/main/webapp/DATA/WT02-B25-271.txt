<H4>by E. Fuller Torrey, M.D.</H4>
</font>
<hr>
	Since 1989, when the Stanley Foundation and NAMI began to directly 
support research, the Stanley Foundation--along with the National 
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the National Alliance for 
Research on Depression and Schizophrenia (NARSAD), and the Scottish 
Rite Schizophrenia Research Program--has become a major source of 
support for research into schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  In 
fact, the Stanley Foundation is presently supporting approximately 
half of all research taking place in the United States directly 
related to bipolar disorder.  This issue's column provides an 
overview of Stanley Foundation research programs.  Subsequent 
columns will describe specific research programs in more detail.
<P>
	The Stanley Foundation research programs began in 1988 when Ted 
and Vada Stanley approached Laurie Flynn and me and asked what they 
might do to support research on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 
<P>
 The Stanleys own MBI Inc., a company in Connecticut that sells 
leather-bound books, collectibles such as Roger Tory Peterson 
songbird plates, commemorative items, World War II leather flight 
jackets (like the one worn by Tom Cruise in Top Gun), and other 
items by direct mail.  These items are advertised in magazines and 
newspapers and sold by various companies under MBI Inc., including 
the Danbury Mint and Easton Press.  In addition to their support of 
psychiatric research, the Stanleys have been longtime supporters of 
many humanitarian causes, including Third World refugee-relief 
efforts and the Habitat for Humanity, associated with former 
president Jimmy Carter.
<P>
	Among the initial programs supported by the Theodore and Vada 
Stanley Foundation were the research-awards program and the Stanley 
Scholars program, and they provide a NAMI staff person to evaluate 
and oversee NIMH research efforts.  The research awards program 
began in 1989 with awards granted to seven out of 35 applicants.  
We were very fortunate to have on the professional committee that 
selected the awardees outstanding scientists such as Nobel Prize 
winners Drs. Julius Axelrod and Carleton Gajdusek and noted senior 
psychiatric researchers such as Dr. Seymour Kety.
<P>
	By 1996 the awards program had grown so that one- or two-year 
awards were given to 50 of 253 applicants.  Another 46 researchers 
received second-year funding based on their 1995 awards, so that 
altogether this year the Stanley Foundation is supporting 96 
research projects under its program.  Awards are for a maximum of 
$75,000 per year for research involving human subjects and $50,000 
per year for laboratory-based research.  Almost all awards are for 
research related to the causes or treatment of schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder, although a few awards have been made for other 
brain disorders such as autism.  Almost 40 percent of the research 
awards go to researchers in other countries, currently including 
Canada, England, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, 
Japan, Taiwan, Australia, India, and Ethiopia.
<P>
	Columns in the next two issues of the Advocate will describe two 
other cornerstones of the Stanley Foundation research program:  the 
Stanley Neurovirology Laboratory at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, 
under Dr. Robert Yolken, and the Bipolar Treatment Network, 
coordinated by Dr. Robert Post at NIMH.  Later columns will 
describe other parts of the research program, including the Stanley 
Scholars program, the European Research Centers program, the 
Stanley Foundation Brain Collection and Neuropathology Consortium, 
the Career Researchers program, and the recently announced Bipolar 
Disorders Research Centers program.  All of this work has been made 
possible through the remarkable generosity and support of Ted and 
Vada Stanley.
