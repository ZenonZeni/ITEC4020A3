ALT="Small Businesses To Benefit From Pension Law Changes">
<BR CLEAR=ALL> 

With the new pension law changes, small businesses are expected
to be among the biggest winners.  In fact, according to estimates
by the <A HREF="http://www.dol.gov">U.S. Department of Labor</A> 
and the Profit Sharing/401(k)
Council of America, at least 10 million workers could benefit
from the changes in the pension laws.
<P>
One of the most critical pieces of the legislation includes a
new savings plan option called SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match
Plan for Employees).  With SIMPLE, employers of 100 or fewer employees
would be able to set up a plan using a one-page form.  In addition,
the cumbersome task of conducting nondiscrimination testing will
no longer be required, making it even easier to set up a plan.
 
<P>
SIMPLE contributions will be immediately vested and fully portable,
making it easier for employers to accept plan rollovers.  Employers
must contribute 3 percent of pay for participating employees or
2 percent of pay for all employees earning at least $5,000, whether
or not they participate.  Under a special rule, the match could
be reduced (but not below 1 percent) in not more than two out
of any five years.  As incentive to keep participants in the plan,
the distribution penalty tax is increased to 25 percent under
SIMPLE and applies to distributions made within the first two
years the employee first participates in the plan.
<P>
The new laws now allow tax-exempt organizations, other than state
and local governments, to offer 401(k) plans to their workers.
 Further changes include the repeal of the family aggregation
law, which will now enable relatives who work in a family business
to earn their own retirement benefits without undue restrictions.
<P>
Consult your tax or legal advisor for a better understanding of
the new legislation and how it may impact your business. If you
