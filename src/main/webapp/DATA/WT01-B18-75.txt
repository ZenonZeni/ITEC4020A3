<H2>History of Recycling in Benton County</H2>

<P><IMG SRC="../frames/images/chart2.gif" WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=229
 ALIGN=right>You may not have
realized it, but May marked an important anniversary for Corvallis
and Benton County. Sixteen years ago, Corvallis and Philomath
residents demonstrated their commitment to reduce the amount of
garbage going to the landfill by participating in the state's first
curbside recycling program.</P>

<P>Since that time, Tangent and Monroe residents have also joined the
ranks of curbside recyclers. Whether recycling at curbside or
bringing materials to a recycling center, residents throughout the
county have sorted their recyclables with such vigor that Benton
County continues to have one of the highest recovery rates in the
state (35%) - second only to Portland (39%).</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#AF0000">How We Got Here </FONT></P>

<P>In January 1990, Corvallis Disposal distributed more than 10,000
red recycling bins. By the end of the year, 40% more people were
recycling, and the amount of recyclables collected was almost twice
that of the previous year. This huge increase in recycling resulted
in a 10% decrease in the amount of garbage dumped into the landfill.
</P>

<P>Each time a new item is added to the list of recyclables, a
greater amount of waste is recovered for recycling.</P>

<P>The large increase in 1993 (see graph) is due to the addition of
mixed paper and yard debris recycling. These two items make up the
majority of household waste, and therefore, offer great potential for
recycling.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#AF0000">Where We're Going</FONT></P>

<P>In 1991, the Oregon Legislature established waste recovery goals
for each county. Benton County's goal was to recycle 30% of its waste
by 1995. We reached this mark in 1993-two years early.</P>

<P>We are now aiming for the statewide goal of recycling half of our
garbage by the year 2000. To reach this goal, we need to continue
adding to the list of acceptable items, but, more importantly, we
need to make recycling easier to do. Corvallis Disposal staff are
evaluating a number of different collection systems that might make
it easier for all to recycle a larger percentage of their waste.</P>

<P>We are also working with businesses to enhance their recycling
programs. In his new role as business resource person, Clint Hilton
will help businesses reach their optimal level of garbage and
recycling service. Pam Wald continues to coordinate the recycling
education program for schools and community groups.</P>

<P>If you have any comments or questions on recycling, you can either
send us a note, call our office, or E-mail us at
mail@disposal.com<HR></P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=6>The Plastic Loop </FONT></H2>

<P>After your recyclable plastic bottles and tubs are picked up at
the curb, they are taken to Source Recycling in Albany.</P>

<P>Source Recycling bales an average of 60,000 pounds of used plastic
containers every month. Once baled, the plastics are sent to the
Garten Foundation in Salem, where they're sorted via a high-tech
computerized system. It quickly and effectively sorts plastic bottles
and tubs according to resin type and color.</P>

<P>However, because of the system's design, lids and containers
smaller than six ounces will simply fall through the cracks_and
plastic bags will clog up the sorter's gears. Also, bags, styrofoam
and clam shell containers are made of a type of plastic that our
markets are not currently interested in buying. For these reasons, we
are not taking lids, bags, clam shells, styrofoam and very small
containers.</P>

<P>Manufacturers purchase the sorted, used plastics to make recycled
products, such as non-food containers, plastic lumber and clothing.
</P>

<H2><HR>It's OK to Mix Your Plastics</H2>

<UL>
   <LI>Bottle-shaped containers larger than six ounces (please remove
   the lids)
   
   <LI>Round food tubs up to two gallons (please remove the lids)
   
   <LI>NO motor-oil and pesticide containers, for health and safety
   reasons
</UL>

 ALIGN=left>Automated Cart
Update</H2>

<P>Many Corvallis and Philomath residents have made the switch to
using a new automated garbage cart instead of a can. If you would
like to join them, please give us a call.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Two Sizes Available: 35 or 90 gallon.
   
   <LI>35 gallon cart costs the same as one-can service; 90 gallon
   cart is $17.20 per month.
   
   <LI>Carts must be at the street by 7:00 a.m. on your garbage day.
   
   <LI>This service is currently offered on most Corvallis and
   Philomath streets, and will be introduced into many suburban areas
   over the next six months.

<H2>Yard Debris Recycling</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>If you are a busy gardener this summer, one yard debris cart may
not seem like enough to hold all the lawn clippings and shrub
trimmings that your yard is producing.</P>

<P>While we can not lessen your work load, a second yard cart may
solve your disposal problem. The cost is $4 per month.</P>

<P>And, be sure to let us know if you would like another yard-debris
calendar to help you keep track of your pick-up days.</P>

<P><HR></P>
<center>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>The total amount of yard debris collected by
Corvallis Disposal since 1993 is enough to cover 17 football fields
three feet deep.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR>Would your group or school like to arrange a
visit from our recycling coordinator?</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Call Pam at 754-0445 ext. 204</P>
