<H4><u>Sexual Assault/Rape</u></H4>
Sexual assault is any forced or coerced sexual act. It can be anything from unwanted touching to rape. It is an act of violence and abuse of power, not just the result of an uncontrollable sex urge. While anyone can commit a sexual assault, over half of all sexual assaults occur between people who know each other.
<p>
Rapists choose victims who are vulnerable. Victims are often vulnerable because they know and trust their assailants. However, be sensible and avoid isolated places.
<p>
Date Violence:  Understand that men and women have a right to set personal sexual limits  and that "NO" means "NO";
<ul>
<li>don't assume that flirtatious behaviour is a signal for sex
<li>clearly communicate your limits, "ESP" does not work
<li>do not confuse "scoring" with having a successful social encounter
<li>do not respond to pressured sex as a means of developing a relationship
<li>be aware of vulnerable situations and have alternatives, 
<li>react negatively to unwanted physical and sexual pressure
</ul>

TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS
Avoid drugs and alcohol - 75% of males and 55% of females who were involved in acquaintance rapes had been drinking or taking drugs just before the sexual attack.
<p>
If you are assaulted, do whatever you need to do to get out alive. Afterwards, go to a safe place and call for assistance:
