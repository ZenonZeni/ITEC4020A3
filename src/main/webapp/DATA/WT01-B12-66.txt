 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>Herbs have been used since creation to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage. Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably will never understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals. These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals,  amino  acids,  enzymes,  bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and concentrated tissue nutrients in select products.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>
<P>  Women, more so than men, are troubled with dynamic changes of the hormone levels in their bodies from day to day and almost moment to moment. Actually, the female endocrine system is always in a state of change, beginning with the first day of each month's cycle and continuing through the last, then the cycle starts all over gain. The herbs in INNER MAGIC F are known for their value in helping to balance the female hormonal system nutritionally.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FEMALE IMBALANCES</H2>
<P>  Symptoms of female imbalances are certainly wide and varied. It is staggering to think that more than 70% of women over the age of 35 have had some kind of hysterectomy.</P>
<P>  Hysterectomy usually results in many sudden hormone changes. When the ovaries are removed, a woman is in instant menopause, a condition wherein the ovaries stop producing estrogen. When this occurs, the adrenals normally take up the slack. However, with most menopausal women, their adrenals have been under so much stress that the adrenals are exhausted.</P>
<P>  The Life Plus INNER MAGIC F formula, as its name suggests, is formulated for special nutritional support for women.  INNER MAGIC F contains nutrients from twelve different herbs including Damiana, Cumin, Norwegian Kelp, Myrrh, Sarsaparilla, Buchu Leaves, Cayenne, Dong Quai, Saw Palmetto, Squaw Vine, Cramp Bark and False Unicorn.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  INNER MAGIC F is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE INNER MAGIC F</H2>
<P>  Most women find that INNER MAGIC F is valuable throughout the whole month, not just during that special time each month. The recommended dosage is two tablets twice a day, morning and evening. When special needs arise, more can be taken.</P>

<P>
Suggested Use:  Two tablets two times a day preferably before meals.</P>
