<p>This monumental study exposes the overriding and pervasive
powers of contemporary collective denial and moral failure
underpinning policies of cannabis prohibition. Motivated by
convenient moralism, questions are repeatedly disingenuously
raised concerning the harm of hemp drugs, cannabis, or marijuana.
The engine of agitprop bureaucratic ire fires up. Hearings are
scheduled, witnesses heard, proceedings transcribed, summarized,
presented to the requesting organization, discussed, filed, and
forgotten. The prohibition policies go on. Enforcement,
corrections systems strain under the demands of majoritarian
magical beliefs in coercive powers of Government; promoted by
continuing self-serving Government misinformation and censorship.
From the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission's policy perspective,
today's drug polices would be unthinkable. <br>
</p>

<p>In the century since the resolution passed the British House
of Commons setting up the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission that
resulted in this massive inquiry documented in a nine volume
report there have been drastic changes in public policy in the
United States and Great Britain.<br>
</p>

<p>The Indian hemp drug regulation policies were explicitly
predicated upon optimal and minimal government intervention.<br>
</p>

<p>The subsequent century in the United States, Great Britain,
and Europe has seen pandemic spread of prohibitionist
authoritarian Government interference- the American Disease-
social experiment run amok. <br>
</p>

<p>Income taxes, mass conscription, and two world wars have seen
regression from utilitarian governance of enlightened
non-interference to intrusive majoritarian autocracy.
Authoritative Government has become authoritarian. Less and less
Government justification and demonstrated necessity are needed.
The principle of non-interference is virtually inoperative. The
space of human existence where a person reigns uncontrolled
contracts even further. The large departments of individualistic
human life are contracted or eliminated by laws, public and
corporate policy. <br>
</p>

<p>The second intervention by Government; giving advice and
promulgating information has seen a parallel degradation. From
legitimate and trustworthy dissemination of factual information
through the institutions of science and medicine to censorship,
giving bad advice, dissimulation and deception in the service of
coercion and manipulation. The ensuing chaos of ignorance,
partial truths, and outright lies has produced a cacophonous
toxic confusion surrounding the use of hemp drugs. The font of
contemporary knowledge is now a stinking swamp, hopelessly
poisoned by the ignorant fantasies, fears, and untruths resulting
from prohibitionists' drug propaganda efforts. <br>
</p>

<p>Fifty years after the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report in
America the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana reported on
use of the drug after a five year study, seven years after
national marijuana prohibition. The perspective was based on the
premise that departments of human life and individual circle with
uncontrolled reign did not include the right to use marihuana.
The authoritative Government intervention of Prohibition is now
accepted; the non-interference principle of the Millsean Indian
Hemp Drugs Administration policy; dead- a luxury enjoyed,
ironically, by people of India subjugated by the British
imperium.<br>
</p>

<p>Descriptions of marihuana use were now from the perspective of
studying the characteristics of the users of this illicit drug:
to what extent, method of distribution, attitude of smoker toward
society and use of the drug, relationship with eroticism, crime,
and juvenile delinquency. Discussions of legitimacy of Government
intervention are by implication discussing the relative
dangerousness of marihuana. The legitimacy of Prohibition as a
social policy was neither justified nor discussed. Religious use
or freedom is not mentioned.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad that the sociological, psychological, and
medical ills commonly attributed to marihuana have been found to
be exaggerated insofar as the City of New York is concerned. I
hasten to point out, however, that the findings are to be
interpreted only as a reassuring report of progress and not as
encouragement to indulgence, for I shall continue to enforce the
laws prohibiting the use of marihuana until and if complete
findings may justify an amendment to existing laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1970 revision in Government marihuana prohibition
policy generated another report in 1972: Marihuana: a Signal of
Misunderstanding- First Report of the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse. <br>
</p>

<p>Individual rights are at least discussed in order to be
heavily discounted:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;So, while we agree with the basic philosophical precept
that society may interfere with individual conduct only in the
public interest, using coercive measures only when less
restrictive measures would not suffice, this principle merely
initiates inquiry into a rational social policy but does not
identify it. We must take a careful look at this complicated
question of the social impact of private behavior. And we must
recognize at the outset the inherent difficulty in predicting
effects on the public health and welfare, and the strong
conflicting notions of what constitutes the public
interest.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Religious freedom&quot; as currently delineated by the
Government places the burden on the individual to pass certain
&quot;tests&quot; to prove that hemp drugs used for sacramental
purposes:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Cases dealing with religious freedom in other contexts
have isolated three distinct foci of inquiry when a law is
challenged as violative of the &quot;free exercise&quot; clause:
(1) Is the claimant's belief and practice really a
&quot;religion&quot; within the meaning of the First Amendment?
(2) If so, is the practice prohibited by the challenged statute
essential to the practice of the &quot;religion?&quot; (3) Even
if the answers to (1) and (2) are yes, is there nevertheless a
sufficiently compelling state interest to warrant overriding the
practice? Only when the proscribed activity is essential to a
qualified &quot;religion&quot; and the state's interest is not
overwhelming will the courts invoke the First Amendment to
invalidate an otherwise permissible legislative
proscription.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1989 Carl Olsen, a white Rastafarian and director of
Iowa NORML unsuccessfully attempted a religious freedom defense
for charges of marijuana selling and importation for distribution
to other members of the Ethiopian Coptic Zion Church.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;If the 'compelling interest' test is to be applied...it
must be applied across the board, to all actions thought to be
religiously commanded... Any society adopting such a system would
be courting anarchy.... The rule respondents favor would open the
prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from
civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind- ranging from
compulsory military service....to the payment of taxes.....drug
laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Dutifully crafted by Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now on the
supreme court, no question of how authoritative interference of
Government is accepted to be appropriate public policy. Religious
freedom is now restricted to activity that must be asserted and
proven rather than assumed. Proving compelling interest has
switched from the Government to the individual.<br>
</p>

<p>Departments of human life were seen not to be imperiously
guarded for the individual but regarded with mistrust and source
of opportunities for dissent against public policy. At the height
of the Vietnam war marijuana use was strongly identified with the
growing student antiwar resistance.<br>
</p>

<p>The non-intervention principle is at least recognized but the
departments of individuality and circle around the individual
were routinely stepped over by Government with justification in
this case for national security. Militarism preempted any
considerations of individual rights of privacy. Departments of
human life were small and confined to cosmetic obligatory
institutional ritual displays in the context of growing public
resistance to the American military industrial behemoth run amok
in southeast Asia.<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the cautious conclusion of the Commission to
critically examine the policies of marijuana prohibition, the
report was conspicuously rejected sight unseen by then president
Richard M. Nixon to demonstrate his being &quot;tough on
crime&quot; in a presidency struggling to end the Vietnam war. <br>
</p>

<p>Twenty-two years later on the centennial of the Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission Report finds the principle of Government
non-interference is an all but forgotten faded idealistic icon,
given hollow obeisance at state ceremonies, a quaint
philosophical curiosity of the past. The circle around the
individual is reduced to a pale, flaccid, tattered, transparent,
and permeable membrane. Intrusion is limited only by available
funding to Government interference. The worsening of the balance
of power between the individual and state has increased by an
order of magnitude, facilitated by advances in technology. <br>
</p>

<p>Toqueville in his prophetic Democracy in America warns of
dangerous forms of despotism in democratic, egalitarian America: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;A great many persons of the present day are quite
contented with this sort of compromise between administrative
despotism and the sovereignty of the people; and they think they
have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when
they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large.
This does not satisfy me: the nature of him I am to obey
signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free
agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the
will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the
uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for
these things; it has predisposed men to endure them and often to
look upon them as benefits.<br>
</p>

<p>After having thus successively taken each member of the
community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, the
supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community. It
covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated
rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds
and most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above the
crowd. The will of the man is not shattered, but softened, bent,
and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are
constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy,
but it prevents existence, it does not tyrannize, but it
compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till
each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid
and industrious animals, of which the government is the
shepherd.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Attacked by oaths of &quot;drug free,&quot; informers
(including children), undercover police, drug-sniffing dogs,
random and warrantless searches, child snatching, drug testing,
forfeiture of property, surveillance of bank, business,
electricity, and other records, the departments of human life
wither. The parts of human life considered reserved territory are
noticeably smaller- the individual, society and
&quot;civilization&quot; suffer the loss.<br>
</p>

<p>Review of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report is important
for perspective in assessing the legitimacy and direction of
contemporary Government drug policy in a democratic society.
Froude's theorem of functional governance: &quot;no laws are of
any service which are above the working level of public morality,
and evasion.&quot; was of importance to feudal England, the
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1894 and a century later a public
policy issue of prime magnitude. <br>
