<H3>The Enrichment Market - Present Outlines and Prospects. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/giletbio.html">Beatrice Gillet</A> and Arnaud de Bourayne.
</H3>
The enrichment market appears to be becoming more global, firstly because of the intermingling of
 previously discrete fuel cycle products and services, notably the market entry of diluted HEU and
 plutonium from nuclear weapons; secondly because market participants are developing new connections
 - producers with producers, producers with utilities, and utilities with utilities; and thirdly because power
 supply market deregulation is influencing utilities' procurement patterns.

<P>
The changes are considered firstly from the suppliers' side. Firstly in the US, main issues at present are
 the HEU deal between the US and Russia, the Suspension Agreements between US and Russia, the
 privatisation of USEC, and US HEU being transferred to USEC, all theses issues being interconnected.
 Difficulties with these arrangements are that USEC is at the same time being asked to make a deal with
 its chief competitor, and to be business-oriented and enhance its value with a view to privatisation; and
 that the Russians have had difficulty in negotiating an acceptable deal. Secondly in Russia, there is supply
 overcapacity and uncertainty about trends in domestic needs, while Russian pricing policy has prompted
 protectionism in the US and EU. There are new developments, however, in both these relationships.
 Thirdly in the EU, Urenco needs to make sales beyond 2000, short term production capacity being sold
 out, but as yet has not been able to make the investment in the new production capacity, long term
 commitments being hard to obtain. Eurodif meanwhile is benefitting from France's favourable nuclear climate.

<P>
Secondly from the utilities' perspective, deregulation is the major trend. In US the 'Exempt Wholesale Generator'
 scheme put utilities and independent generators on equal terms. In Europe deregulation is newer and
 complicated by the variety of different systems, plus uncertainty over such issues as whether a member
 state should grant a production licence to a chosen supplier for a new power plant, or whether a call for
 bids should be issued to European partners; who should have access to the distribution network; and who
 should be in charge of power transmission. A compromise based on the 'single buyer scheme' seems likely
 to emerge, and though many issues await solution, many links already exist between European producers.

<P>
Another concern of utilities is the future of nuclear in light of some government policies. In Germany,
 utilities are unable to make plans for their reactors for longer than five years ahead, due to the insecurity
 of their operating licences in an anti-nuclear environment. Within the anti-nuclear opposition party, the
 SDP, however, there have been calls for a 'reassessment of nuclear energy'. Acceptance in Sweden
 is improving, but in other areas is problematic. Only Asia is in favour of expanding nuclear capacity.

<P>
The changes have eliminated artificial differences in the price of enrichment services, and a more balanced
 procurement programme is emerging, Their aims are now to minimise risks through procurement diversification,
 purchase from primary producers not traders, and find flexible, reliable suppliers.
