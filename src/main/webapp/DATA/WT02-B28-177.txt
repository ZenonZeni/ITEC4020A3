<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Term vs. Permanent Life
Insurance</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>A Fresh Look At An Age-old Question</STRONG>



<P>
The term versus cash value life insurance debate has gone on for years, as if it
were
possible to say
that one type of coverage is all good, the other all bad.  Sorry, it's just not
that
simple.<P>
Term life insurance has its place. If you're young or cash shy, term can be an
ideal stopgap
solution; it
can provide you and your family with maximum coverage for the lowest immediate
premium
outlay. If the
choice is an adequate amount of term coverage versus no protection at all, term
insurance may
well be
the best choice.<P>
It is also very often the product of choice when protection needs may be high for a
period of
time, then
drop back, such as when your family is growing. Term insurance can also be an
effective way
to
supplement permanent insurance during high-need years, such as when family and
other
financial
responsibilities are outpacing income.<P>
In these situations, term coverage allows you to obtain crucial death benefit
protection
without breaking
your budget. Also, if the coverage is convertible (the coverage can be "converted"
to a
comparable cash
value policy, without the need to provide evidence of insurability), you can get
the coverage
you need
today...with the ability to obtain permanent coverage in the future. In this
respect, term
insurance meets
a valuable need.
<P>
<STRONG>The True Cost of Term Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>
However, term insurance has its drawbacks. It certainly isn't right for all people
or under
all
circumstances. Among its weaknesses, be aware of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You do have to die to "win." As unpleasant as that sounds, it's true. Term life
insurance
provides a
death benefit only, and only for a specific period of time. When the term of
coverage
expires, so does
your protection. Also, if you stop paying premiums, the coverage ends. Period.
<P>
<LI>Let's say that you own $500,000 of term insurance. You've kept the coverage in
force for
ten years,
and
the policy expires at midnight on December 31. If you die at 11:59 on New Year's
Eve, your
family
receives the full $500,000 in death benefit proceeds. However, if you die at 12:01
on January
1, your
family receives nothing under the policy, since the contract has expired.
<P>
<LI>Purchasing term insurance has often been compared to renting a house. When you
rent, you
get
the
full and immediate use of the house and all that goes with it, but only for as long
as you
continue paying
rent. As soon as your lease expires, you must leave. Even if you rented the house
for 30
years, you have
no "equity" or value that belongs to you.
<P>
<LI>There is the very real danger of becoming uninsurable when the term coverage
expires.
While
many
term policies are convertible to permanent coverage, others may not be. Most of
all, even if
the coverage
is convertible, there are time limits. If the policy is allowed to expire, you may
be
required to reapply. If
you are found to be uninsurable at that time, you will be without coverage.
<P>
<LI>The long-term cost of term can become increasingly burdensome. Premiums
increase at each
renewal, with the price per thousand dollars of coverage becoming prohibitive for
many people
as they
get older. Many people buy term coverage when they're in their 20s because it seems
downright
cheap
compared to a cash value policy with the same death benefit amount. By the time
they're in
their 40s,
the coverage seems a bit pricey, as the rate goes up. In their 50s, the cost has
generally
well
outstripped the cost of permanent coverage. Finally, in their 60s, if not sooner,
they drop
the policy - not
because they no longer need the protection, but because they can't afford it.
Meanwhile, the
person who
may have paid more for that permanent policy in his or her 20s may still be paying
the same
premium.
<P>
</UL>
<STRONG>The Value of Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>
Cash value life insurance is still the best long-term solution for many people. The
reasons:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It <EM>always</EM> pays. Cash value life insurance provides life-long insurance
protection. With few
exceptions,
once you have been approved for the coverage, your policy cannot be canceled by the
carrier,
provided
you pay all required premiums. Regardless of your health or other factors, the
insurance will
remain in
force.
<P>
<LI>Higher initial premiums can actually be less expensive than term in the long
run. In
fact, the policy
may
be able to "pay for itself." Most permanent policies are eligible for dividends,
which are
not guaranteed,
if and when they are declared by the insurance company. Many companies offer the
option to
apply
accumulated dividends towards payment of all or part of the premiums. If values are
sufficient,
out-of-pocket premium payments may end after several years, yet coverage can
continue for
life. So
long-term net cost can be quite low compared to the total cost for a term policy.
<P>
<LI>It can eliminate the problem of future insurability. Cash value life insurance
does not
expire after a
certain period of time. It does not need to be renewed. Also, some policies contain
guaranteed
purchase options, which allow you to buy additional coverage at specified times,
regardless
of your
health.
<P>
<LI>It builds cash value. These dollars - which, under many policies, are
guaranteed - can be
used in
the
future for any purpose you wish. If you like, you can borrow cash value for a down
payment on
a home,
to help pay for your children's education or to provide income for your retirement.
(Note:
Borrowing cash
value from your policy will affect your total policy values.) Plus, if you decide
to stop
paying premiums
and surrender your policy, the guaranteed policy values are yours.
</UL>
<P>

Recommendation: When purchasing coverage - or renewing a term policy - look at more
than just
the
premium. To help you select the best-choice coverage for you, contact your New York

review
the pros
and cons of the various options available to you, all at no cost or obligation.<P>
