<title>Energy Efficiency and Renewables Markets Are Rapidly

<H2><I>C. </I>Energy Efficiency and Renewables Markets Are Rapidly 
Growing, and Creating Jobs</H2>
<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>Energy-efficiency and renewables-technology markets are growing 
rapidly and generating thousands of jobs nationwide. The American Council 
for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) estimates that efficiency 
improvements consistent with a 2.4 percent annual reduction in national 
energy usage (the rate achieved in the U.S. during 1973-1986) could create 
a net increase of nearly 500,000 jobs by the year 2000 and nearly 1.1 
million new jobs by 2010.<a href="#12" name="r12"> [ 12 ] </a>
<p>     A recent study has found that in Ohio alone as many as 63,000 jobs 
could be created by the year 2010 through energy-efficiency investments 
and the manufacture of energy-efficiency products.<a href="#13" name="r13"> [ 13 ] </a>For example, new jobs 
have been created at <B><I><A NAME="StaberIndustries">Staber Industries<a></B></I> in Groveport, Ohio, 
which makes energy-saving clothes washers, and at <B><I><A NAME="GeneralElectric">General Electric<a></B></I> in Circleville, Ohio, which makes compact fluorescent 
light bulbs. The majority of new jobs nationwide would be created as money 
saved on power bills is recirculated into the economy and spent on 
additional products and services.<a href="#14" name="r14"> [ 14 ] </a>
<p>     Current energy efficiency markets are already sizable. The global 
energy efficiency market is now in excess of $80 billion per year, and is 
projected to reach $115-140 billion annually by 2015.<a href="#15" name="r15"> [ 15 ] </a>
Energy efficiency and environmental technology markets are large and 
growing all over the world.<a href="#16" name="r16"> [ 16 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="16"  HREF="#r16">16.</a> The global market for energy efficiency and environmental products and 
services is currently estimated to be $425 billion. Estimates of the scale 
of these markets vary widely, primarily because there is no agreement on 
which industries and technologies to include. The U.S. market for 
pollution avoidance and remediation alone is $134 billion per year. United
