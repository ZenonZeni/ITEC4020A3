<H1>What is Climate?</H1>
<p>
<i> Climate is the average course of weather or conditions at a place over a period of years.  
</i><p>
<h3>
<p>
Climatic changes take place over months, years, thousands or even millions of years.  Thanks to technological advances, measuring and studying many factors that affect climate is now possible.  Reliable records of weather and climate are available for the past century, but these measurements were usually taken only over land areas.  With TOPEX/Poseidon, the remaining 70% of the Earth's surface, the oceans, can finally begin to be accurately included into global climate models.
