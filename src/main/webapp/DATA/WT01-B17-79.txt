<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Struggle for Freedom of Medical Choice is the 
Political Issue of the Decade</CENTER></H3>
<HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Patients Speak
<BR><EM>Give Us the Alternative!</EM></CENTER></H2>

<EM>Americans are telling the pollsters they're not satisfied with their conventional
doctors. They're getting better results with alternative physicians, they're placing much
more confidence in alternative medicine, and keeping they're options open. That's what
two different consumer polls recently revealed.</EM>
<P>
<HR>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>TOO MANY M.D.s DON'T LISTEN TO THEIR PATIENTS</CENTER></H3>

A new survey of 70,000 readers of Consumer Reports, probably the largest survey conducted
to date on the doctor-patient relationship, reveals that many patients  feel their
conventional M.D.s are not open to their questions or views and don't give them enough
(or any) advice on how to have a healthy lifestyle. The survey shows that too many
conventional doctors don't know how to talk with their patients or how to work with them
cooperatively in the healing process. These are &quot;potentially serious problems,&quot; the study
concluded.


<P>The greatest patient grumbling is in the area of chronic ailments for which no standard
treatment is available.  In the past year, 23% of patients were disatisfied with their
conventional doctor over poor results for chronic headache, 28% for lower back pain, 15%
for depression, 14% for arthritis and intestinal problems, 12% for allergies, and 11% for
cancer and respiratory problems.


<P>Patients of mainstream M.D.s are also complaining about problems in the examining room.
Many doctors, they feel, do not put the patient first.  Among the patient gripes with
their regular doctors,  29% said the M.D. didn't seek their opinion or explain lifestyle
changes that might improve the problem; 26% complained their doctors didn't go over the
possible side-effects of the drugs; 22% said their doctors never took a complete medical
history; 20% found their doctors discouraged patient questions; and 15% said their
doctors didn't seem to care about the patient's emotional well-being. The writing is
definitely on the waiting room walls.


<P>A separate survey of 600 people  dramatically shows that patients are asking questions,
demanding information, and keeping their alternatives open. In this group, 65% asked
their doctors to explain unfamiliar terms; 62% asked about side-effects  and alternatives
to the drugs prescribed;  50% wanted to know about risks in surgery; 48% did their own
independent research on their condition.


<P>The survey also showed that 44% asked about alternatives to the standard tests or surgery
or wanted to know; 44% wanted to know about other treatments available; 43% queried their
M.D.'s experience in similar cases; 36% wrote their questions down in advance; 26% took
notes on their office visit; 25% complained that what their doctor recommended wasn't
working; 19% asked to see their medical records. Clearly the days of the passive,
compliant patient are history.
<P>
<HR>
<P><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>PATIENTS WANT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE-Their Office Visits Prove It</CENTER></H3>


<P>SELF Magazine polled its readers, mostly upmarket, well-educated, professional,
forty-something women, about their opinions and practices regarding alternative medicine.
The findings are good news  indeed for the medical alternative.


<P>When SELF asked its readers if they had ever consulted an alternative practitioner, 84%
said yes. When asked what they thought of alternative medicine in general, 53% said
sometimes it works, sometimes not; but 36% admitted they have more faith in it than in
conventional medicine; 8% worried about possible dangers to its use;  and only 2% were
openly skeptical.  So much for the &quot;unproven quackery&quot; issue that opponents of
alternative medicine so often insist on.


<P>Among the most popular alternative therapies consulted are chiropractic (60%), massage
(58%), herbalism (42%), relaxation techniques (40%), acupuncture (30%), and reflexology
(24%). But among those disciplines SELF readers haven't yet tried but would like to,
acupuncture ranked highest.


<P>Regarding cures with alternative therapies, 75% said they knew someone (including
themselves) who had been cured, while only 25% said they had been disappointed by the
results.  Then came the clincher: When asked on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest,
how much confidence do you place in conventional medicine, only 11% gave it the highest
marks. But when asked the same question about alternative medicine, 30% ranked it in
category 5. In other words, these well-informed health care consumers have 3 times more
confidence in alternative medicine than in the conventional approaches.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Key to Real Freedom of Choice 
<BR>in Medical Care</CENTER></H2>

The real politics of medicine in the 1990s is not about who is going to pay the $1
trillion annual health care bill, but why there isn't a cheaper, more effective
alternative. Alternative medicine, as many now know, is that more effective alternative,
yet the key issue nobody is talking about is this: how come it's not more widely
available in every state and how come the insurance companies aren't paying for it when
it would save them money?


<P>The reason is a little known political fact that took shape in the 1920s and has never
been changed since. It's called the Medical Practices Acts. These were similar laws
passed by all the States to insure that only M.D.s could be licensed and thus
legitimately practice medicine. The idea was to deliberately set up a medical monopoly
that favored conventional doctors. The idea was also to keep homeopaths, naturopaths,
herbalists, and chiropractors out of the marketplace by regulating the licensing of
physicians.


<P>The practical result is that there is no free and open competition in the American
medical marketplace. You have the right to choose your physician, provided it is an
allopathic M.D., but you cannot, in most cases, choose between an M.D. and an N.D.
(naturopath) and expect to get insurance reimbursement.


<P>Freedom of choice is available in most areas of American life except medicine. There it
is tightly held by the conventional medical establishment and the strong economic and
political interests supporting it. Repeal of the Medical Practices Acts, at the state
level, would throw the medical marketplace open to free competition among all the medical
specialities-for the first time in 100 years. 


<P>The alternative would quickly become the new mainstream, just as it did in 1830's America
when the M.D.s had a similar &quot;death-grip&quot; on medicine and were faced with honest
competition from a new wave of homeopaths and herbalists.  What happened 160 years ago
ought to happen again: &quot;The public, disgusted with the maltreatment it was receiving,
stripped the licensed profession of its legal protection and threw the practice of
medicine open to all comers,&quot; says medical historian Harris Coulter, Ph.D.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>America's Gestapo, The FDA, Strikes Again-With No Basis</CENTER></H3>


<P>While Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., was on CBS' This Morning March 24 in New York
City, proudly presenting 3 of his cancer patients whom he had healed with his
antineoplaston therapy, the Fda barged into his Houston offices with a search warrant and
seized 15 patient records. FDA officials claimed Dr. Burzynski was &quot;illegally&quot; shipping
his medicines interstate. However, they evidently forgot that they had already
commissioned Dr. Burzynski as a special clinical investigator with the legal right to
ship his medicines interstate to patients. In their desperate zeal to squash all
successful alternatives, the FDA doesn't hesitate to break even their own rulings.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>CANCER RESEARCH DEADEND</CENTER></H2>

For the last 40 years, cancer research has been based on a false model 
of biology-no wonder it's failed to come up with any cures.


<P>Imagine if the prevailing theory in astronomy were still the incorrect notion that the
Sun revolves around the Earth. Would you trust the findings and techniques that came out
of such a clearly mistaken view? Yet for the last 40 years cancer research has been
founded on a similarly mistaken model. As 500,000 die from cancer every year, the medical
establishment wages its costly but ineffectual &quot;war against cancer&quot; based on a completely
false model.


<P>That model is based on studying cancer cells in a petri dish, far removed from their
context, the living human body. This procedure is called &quot;cell lines&quot; and has been
favored by cancer researchers for decades. The trouble is, it has nothing to do with the
reality of cancer within the body.


<P>Cell lines represent a unique new form of life  that has very little to do with the
reality of cancer. Cancer cells implanted in a petri dish do things cells never do
anywhere else: they don't die.  They are immortal. Their behavior is completely different
than cells in a living body. And some of them are 40 years old.


<P>In 1951, cells from the cancerous cervix of Helen Lane were removed from her body after
death at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. They were placed in a petri dish
and allowed to grow. This was the first cell line, now called HeLa, and 44 years later,
cancer researchers around the world are still using descendants (cell lines) from her
original tumor. In other words, hardly any cancer research is done on freshly obtained
malignant cells.


<P>Virtually the entire multibillion dollar cancer research edifice is founded on this
erroneous model of biology reports researcher Gerald B. Dermer, Ph.D.  Not only that, but
many cancer researchers know the cell line model is incorrect but don't wish to lose
their funding by admitting it publicly.  This explains why the leading cancer
&quot;therapies,&quot; such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation, based on the cell line
model, work so poorly.
 

<P>The contradictions between the real world of cancer in living men and women and the
artificial, theoretical world of cancer in a glass dish is the core of the scandal and
deception in cancer research.


<P>Meanwhile, scientists keep the truth under wraps to keep the research dollars flowing.
This is the secret of the astonishing failure of cancer research. As one researcher
privately admitted, &quot;The bottom line is dollars.&quot;
