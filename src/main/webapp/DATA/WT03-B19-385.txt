<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 227</TITLE>

<H1>The economic argument<BR>
for adopting a balanced response<BR>
to climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>Most economists would recommend that we carefully evaluate both the costs and benefits 
of our response to climate change. </B>At one extreme, some people argue that no policy on 
climate change is needed because not enough is known about the problem. At the other extreme are 
those who contend that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases must be stabilized whatever 
the cost. Economic analysis takes the middle road: it argues against inaction because the cost of a 
very modest policy would be less than the expected benefit. It also advises against drastic action, as 
the expected benefit of a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be smaller than the 
cost.<P>
<B>The most economically efficient approach would be to adopt a range of policies. 
</B>Further research is clearly needed to reduce the scientific uncertainties of climate change and to 
gain more insight into possible policy responses. In the meantime, action should be taken to reduce 
emissions of greenhouse gases, to increase the environment’s capacity for absorbing gases already 
present in the atmosphere, and to adapt to climate change. These policies should all be subject to the 
same economic calculus. Society should not spend more money on reducing emissions by one ton 
than it could on creating "sinks" to absorb the equivalent amount from the atmosphere, because 
these different actions have the same net effect. Similarly, the cost of these activities should not be 
greater than the cost of reducing damage by an equivalent amount through adaptation to climate 
change impacts (e.g. constructing dikes and sea walls).<P>
<B>Climate change policies should be as comprehensive as possible and should apply to as 
many different greenhouse gases as practical</B>. Policy-makers should consider two points. 
First, although making the first small reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would be 
inexpensive, the marginal cost1 (i.e. the per-ton cost of successive reductions) would rise steeply for 
further cuts in emissions. This would also apply to the other greenhouse gases: CFCs, methane, 
nitrous oxide, and so on. Second, each gas has a different global warming potential (GWP), 
depending on how potent it is, how long it remains in the atmosphere, and other factors (fact sheet 7). 
Scientists use GWPs to determine how releasing one ton of a gas would affect the radiative properties 
of the atmosphere relative to the release of one ton of carbon dioxide. Based on this measure of 
"CO2-equivalence", and the fact that it is cheaper to reduce the emissions of many gases by a little 
than to reduce one gas by a lot, policy-makers can attempt to lower emissions of all greenhouse gases 
to the point where the cost of abating an extra unit of GWP for each gas just equals the expected 
damage avoided.<P>
<B>Some abatement should be undertaken. . .</B> It is widely accepted that a small reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions would produce a positive benefit and yet would not cost very much. 
Eliminating the first few tons of carbon dioxide emissions, for example, would require just a tiny 
move away from carbon-intensive fuels. This suggests that at least<I> some</I> reduction should be 
undertaken.<P>
<B>but not as much as would be required to stabilize current concentrations. </B>Scientists 
have estimated that CO2 emissions would have to be cut by some 60% to stabilize atmospheric 
concentrations at their present level. The cost of such a policy would be huge. According to one 
study, the marginal cost1 of stabilizing CO2 concentrations (i.e. the cost of cutting the last ton of 
carbon) would be about $1,600 in the year 2020.2<P>
<B>Modest reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are clearly justified.</B> The question 
is, how much of this reduction should be achieved by reducing emissions, and how much through 
enhancing or creating "sinks". The figure below shows how one leading economist3 estimates the 
incremental costs of cutting a certain percentage of net greenhouse gas emissions through a 
combination of abatement and sink enhancement. One curve shows the marginal costs of reducing 
CO2 emissions, another the marginal costs for reducing CFCs, and a third the marginal costs for 
achieving equivalent reductions by planting trees to create a carbon sink. These three curves are 
summed up to create the fourth curve, which is the total marginal costs of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions through both abatement and sink enhancement. The three horizontal lines represent 
estimates of the marginal damage that would be caused by climate change. Each one represents a 
scenario based on different assumptions about how much damage would result from a doubling of 
greenhouse gas concentrations (calculated in CO2 equivalents).4 According to this analysis, a 
medium-damage scenario justifies an 11% reduction in CO2-equivalent emissions, of which about 2% 
comes from CO2, 9% from CFCs, and virtually nothing from tree planting. The high damage case 
would justify a one-third reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but even this amount would not be 
sufficient to stabilize atmospheric concentrations.<P>
<B>Policy-makers must be careful when they interpret the results of this analysis</B>. The 
great virtue in the above economic analysis is that it explicitly represents costs and benefits. However, 
there is still a great deal of uncertainty when it comes to measuring the costs and benefits of climate 
change policy (fact sheets 228 and 229). What’s more, the above analysis assumes that small changes 
in emissions would only lead to small changes in climate change impacts. If there exists a threshold 
beyond which small changes in greenhouse gas concentrations would cause a rapid worsening of 
climate impacts, then the best policy may be one that would be strong enough to avoid that threshold. 
Scientists have not yet identified such a threshold, however, so economists continue to recommend 
policies that are modest and flexible.<P>

	1  The marginal cost is the cost of reducing emissions by one additional unit (e.g. a ton). Economists derive marginal costs on the 
assumption that the cheapest option for abatement would be exploited first, followed by the more expensive ones. This results in the 
marginal cost rising as the level of greenhouse gas abatement increases.<P>
