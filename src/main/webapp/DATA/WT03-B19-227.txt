<P>
Aviation employs 36,000 people in Australia. Demand for air travel is picking up
 as world economic conditions improve and excess capacity is gradually declining
.
<P>
The Australian aviation industry has the potential to provide airport 
development, training and consultancy services in Asia where the aviation 
industry is expanding rapidly and infrastructure needs to be upgraded.
<P>
Industry capacity includes business, tourism, marketing and infrastructure 
services together with complementary service transport access to major airports
, and the long-term enhancement of airport potential through appropriate 
planning and environmental management.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
The two major Australian airlines, Qantas and Ansett, employ around 10,000 
people in Victoria. Other aviation activities including the operation of 
Melbourne Airport, research and development, and suppliers of aviation equipment employ around 1,300 people.
<P>
In 1993-94, Melbourne Airport handled nine million domestic passengers and two 
million international passengers and generated a record profit of $44 million
 before tax and interest.
<P>
Airports at Moorabbin and Essendon provide general aviation services, while 
Avalon is part-owned and leased by ASTA and serves as a freight and maintenance centre and as an airport.
<P>
Melbourne is emerging as a major centre for the industry in the Asia-Pacific 
region. Ansett Airlines is headquartered in Melbourne.

<P>
The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has forecast the volume of
Australian air traffic to grow at around 7% over the second half of the 1990s.
