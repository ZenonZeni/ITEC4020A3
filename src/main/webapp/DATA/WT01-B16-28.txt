<p><hr>
  <body><h4>
This past fall, 10 scholars were selected from a pool of more
than 120 applicants to receive scholarships through the
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Undergraduate
Scholarship Program, sponsored by the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM). The 10 recipients, all
students attending historically black colleges or universities 
located throughout the United States, were chosen by a panel
comprised of representatives from historically black colleges and
universities and experts in civilian radioactive waste management
from Department of Energy's  national laboratories, academia, and
private industry.
<p>
The HBCU Undergraduate Scholarship Program is designed to
encourage students to consider a career in high-level radioactive
waste management by providing support to academically superior
juniors and seniors pursuing degrees in related fields at
historically black colleges and universities. It is hoped that
undergraduate scholars may, in the future, participate in OCRWM's
Radioactive Waste Management Graduate Fellowship Program, thereby
increasing the diversity of OCRWM's future workforce.
<p>
The scholarship award includes payment of tuition and fees and a
monthly stipend, as well as a summer internship assignment at a
Department of Energy site, where students perform work supporting
the OCRWM program. Scholarship recipients also participate in an
orientation workshop in Las Vegas, Nevada, the first of which was
held in September 1995. The workshop included meetings with staff
from the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Office and the
United States Geological Survey, an overview of the Yucca
Mountain Project at the Yucca Mountain Science Center, and an
all-day tour of the Yucca Mountain site.
