<CENTER><B>LEGISLATIVE UPDATE</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<B><U>Reauthorization of IDEA</B></U> -- <B>LATE BREAKING NEWS!!</B><P>
Of course, as soon as your faithful DPP staff had finished the last edits on the CAN mailing, we got our hands on the new House draft of the reauthorization of IDEA.  While the new draft maintains most of the House's original proposals, this second draft poses additional and significant changes to IDEA.<P>
<B><U>Under Parts A and B</B></U><P>
*     continues to propose changing the funding formula over a ten-year period from a per-child distribution to one based on population of children aged 3-21 with a poverty factor;<BR>
<BR>
*     adds "neurobiological brain disorder" to the definition of child with a disability;<BR>
<BR>
*     changes from 25 percent to 10 percent the amount of Part B funds a State can use for State activities -- 90 percent of funds must pass through to the LEAs; a similar provision governs funds for preschool grants; <BR>
<BR>
*     eliminates the prohibition barring States from commingling IDEA funds with<BR>
     other funds, and broadens waiver authorization on supplanting funds; <P>
*     removes requirement in Part B for States to have a Comprehensive System of<BR>
     Personnel Development (CSPD);<P>
*     includes an authorization level for Part B State Grants of $2,323,837,000 for FY 1996 and such sums for following years; for Preschool Grants $360,409,000 for FY 1996 and such sums;<BR>
<BR>
*     requires parental consent for an initial evaluation to determine if a child qualifies as a child with a disability; if the parent refuses, the agency can continue to pursue an evaluation by utilizing mediation and due process procedures;<BR>
<BR>
*     changes language regarding parental notices by allowing agencies to send information concerning procedural safeguards in the initial parental notice, IEP meetings, when a parent files a complaint, and when parents ask for it; and<BR>
<BR>
*     changes discipline language to allow a hearing officer -- to the same extent as a court -- to order a change in placement of a child with a disability to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 days if the child carries a weapon or drugs to school, the child engages in violent acts, or if the maintenance of the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others; if the behavior was found not to be an manifestation of the child's disability, the relevant disciplinary procedures applicable to children without disabilities shall be applied.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Part C (Early Intervention)</B></U><P>
*     includes an authorization of $315,754,000 for Part C (early intervention);<BR>
<BR>
*     changes early intervention grants from 3-year grants to 5-year grants; and<BR>
<BR>
*     eliminates the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council required under Part H<BR>
     of IDEA;<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Part D</B></U><P>
*     continues to consolidate the discretionary programs into 3 main parts: <B>Subpart I</B> --General Provisions and National Activities; <B>Subpart II</B>--State Program<BR>
     Improvement Grants for Children with Disabilities; and <B>Subpart III</B>--Parent<BR>
     Training;   <P>
*     further consolidates authorities under Subpart I by replacing separate sections addressing professional development, technology, media, and research, into a condensed list of activities the Secretary may fund;<BR>
<BR>
*     eliminates provisions on IDEA clearinghouses;<BR>
<BR>
*     reduces provision on indirect costs from 25 percent to not more than 10 percent; <BR>
<BR>
*     authorizes $135.6 million for Subpart I; eliminates funding floor for projects addressing children with serious emotional disturbance and for children with severe disabilities; keeps funding floor for children with deaf-blindness and for addressing postsecondary needs of individuals with deafness;<BR>
<BR>
*     changes language governing required participants for developing the State Improvement Plan, under Subpart II, to make IHEs optional participants;<BR>
<BR>
*     under Subpart II, requires SEAs to make subgrants only to LEAs, who may then award subgrants to any person; does not include an authorization level for Subpart II, promising it will be supplied; and<BR>
<BR>
*     changes the authorization level for Subpart III--Parent Training from $15 million to $13,535,000 for FY 1996 and such sums through 2001.       <BR>
 <BR>

     The Senate has not yet released its draft bill for the reauthorization of IDEA.  The draft is expected to be released by November 15.  Chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, Senator Frist (R-TN), has stated his intention to keep the current per child allocation formula for the Part B<BR>
State Grant program.  Talks between regular education organizations and the disability community continue on issues surrounding the discipline of children with disabilities and IDEA's procedural safeguards.  <P>
     It seems more and more likely that with the end of the year approaching and Congressional time taken up with serious budget issues, the reauthorization of IDEA will continue through next year.  <BR>
We will be updating our comparison of the different proposals for the reauthorization of IDEA and will make it available as soon as possible.
<B><U>FY 1996 Appropriations, the Saga Continues</B><P>
     </U>When we last left our heroes and heroines,  a continuing resolution (CR) had been passed extending funding authority for education appropriations until November 13.  The Senate has still not passed its version of the FY 1996 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.  In order for funding to continue past November 13, one of three things has to happen:  an extension of the current CR, a new CR, or passage and Presidential signature of the FY 1996 appropriations bill.  At this point, a new CR that will fund programs through November 29 or December 5 seems most likely, giving House and Senate appropriators more time to work out FY 1996 appropriations.  House Republicans have promised that the next CR will not be as "kind" as the first one, which prohibited cutting a programs' funding more than 10 % below the FY 1995 level.<BR>
 <BR>
     CEC is continuing its communication to Congress and to the President stressing the need for continued support for special education and gifted education.  We urge CAN coordinators to continue their networks' communication to their Senators and Representatives in their States.  <BR>

<B><U>Reconciliation Bill</B></U>       <U><P>
     </U>As you know, in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002 and thus enact a large part of the "Contract with America," Republicans have proposed drastic cuts to federal spending.  To reach this target that was passed in the FY 1996 Budget Resolution, funding can be cut two ways: through individual appropriation bills for discretionary spending, and by cutting spending for entitlement programs.  Savings can also be attained by changing the tax code.  In a nutshell, entitlement programs are programs in which a certain criteria is set out in law and anyone meeting that criteria is guaranteed benefits.  Congress estimates how much will be spent for entitlement programs for budgeting purposes, but the funds will rise or fall depending on how many people have qualified for the program.  Examples of entitlement programs are the Medicare program, Medicaid, and student loan programs.  To achieve savings through entitlement programs Congress must go back into the law and change the criteria for which people qualify or otherwise change the authorizing language to cut estimated spending.  Changing the authorizing language governing entitlements and changing the tax code occurs through the process called "reconciliation."  Congress does not need to enact a reconciliation bill every year or any year, only when changes to entitlement programs and the tax code are desired.  This is such a year.   <U><P>
     </U>The House passed its version of the reconciliation bill on October 26 by a vote of 227-203. The Senate followed suit on the 28th by a vote of 52-47.  The votes were mainly on party lines, with Republicans voting for passage and the Democrats voting against.  CEC opposed passage of the bills and sent letters to both the House and the Senate protesting the changes that would be enacted as a result of the proposed legislation.  Specifically the reconciliation bills include:<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Overall discretionary funding caps that would cut education funding 33 percent over seven years;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Changes to Medicaid that would block grant funds to States and no longer allow reimbursement for schools for related services to Medicaid eligible children with disabilities;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Changes to Medicaid that would no longer guarantee Early Periodic Screening and Diagnostic Testing (EPSDT) services for Medicaid eligible children; and<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Further changes to Medicaid that would strip the guarantee of currently eligible people with disabilities of Medicaid coverage (see following Medicaid article for more details).<BR>
<BR>
     Please see the attached letter to Congress (<B>Attachment I</B>).  We will continue to fight against these changes.  President Clinton has announced he will veto the Republican proposals; however, it is expected that after the veto some compromises will be made.  We urge you to be in contact with members on the importance of the proposed changes.<BR>

<B><U>Vocational Education</B></U><P>
     Both the House and the Senate have passed legislation that will consolidate more than 80 job training and education programs, including the Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.  CEC's main concern with the consolidation of vocational education is the continued access to vocational education by students with disabilities.  The House and Senate versions of the consolidations have crucial differences.  CEC has sent letters to the conferees on the bills expressing our recommendations for the final legislation.  Included in our letter are the following recommendations:<P>
&iuml;     CEC recommends the final legislation keep the current within-State formula for grants that takes into consideration the number of children with individualized education programs being served in the locality;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     CEC recommends the conferees adopt the House definition of at-risk students that includes students with disabilities.  Throughout the legislation special consideration is made for at-risk students.  We believe children with disabilities should be included in the definition;<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The Senate bill includes inclusive language that speaks to educating all students and sets up benchmarks to measure the progress of different populations, including students with disabilities.  This language should be retained in any final legislation; and<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The House bill includes language that would allow localities to fund supplementary services for special populations.  CEC strongly believes this language should be retained.<BR>
<BR>
     The conferees have not yet met to iron out the differences between the two bills  but are expected to do so soon.  We will keep you updated as the legislation moves forward.   Please see the attached letter to the conferees (<B>Attachment II</B>).  <BR>

<B><U>Restrictions on Advocacy Activities for Non-Profit Organizations </B></U><P>
<B>     </B>House Republicans are trying to further restrict lobbying from non-profit organizations.  Representative Istook (R-OK) has successfully attached an amendment to the House Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill that would drastically alter current regulations governing advocacy activities from 501(c)(3) organizations.  Currently, non-profit organizations who receive federal grants are prohibited from using any of the grant money for advocacy activities.  "Advocacy" is narrowly defined as direct lobbying activities.  Rep. Istook, along with Rep. McIntosh (R-IN), would like to change the current prohibition on federal grantees to further restrict nonprofits ability to conduct advocacy activities.  <P>
     Rep. Istook so far has been unsuccessful in getting his amendment to final passage.   The original  "Istook Amendment" would prohibit any organization that receives a federal grant to spend no more than 5 percent of its overall budget on advocacy activities and  greatly widened the definition of advocacy to include such things as the costs of newsletters, if included in the newsletter is a call for political action, has been modified in an attempt to win passage.  The current amendment, which is expected to be voted on separately during the debate on the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government appropriations bill, would impose tight limits on privately-funded advocacy by organizations that get more than one-third of their income from the federal government.  The amendment would also reduce permitted privately-funded advocacy expenditures for all organizations with budgets in excess of $20 million.  The amendment would also keep the widened definition of advocacy.  Also, if Organization (A) received federal grants, fell under the Istook amendment, and  was a member of Organization (B) who conduced advocacy activities, Organization (A) would have to report all of the activities of Organization (B) if Organization (B) spends more than 15 percent of its budget on advocacy.  This provision would stifle associations from forming coalitions to impact legislation by requiring mountains of paperwork.   <P>
     CEC strongly opposes the Istook amendment and is working with a coalition of organizations called "Let America Speak" to ensure that nonprofits are able to continue their advocacy efforts.  CEC believes that the current prohibition against using federal grant money for direct lobbying addresses concerns regarding the use of taxpayer money and should not be used as leverage to silence an organization from communicating its views to Congress.  Interestingly, the amendment does not address federal contractors.<P>
<B>Status</B>:   The original Istook amendment is currently on the House version of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill and will thus be a part of any conference with the Senate bill.  Rep. Istook's modified amendment will be voted on separately when the conference report for the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government appropriations bill is voted on in the House and Senate. In the meantime, Rep. McIntosh has been holding hearings in which he has had nonprofit organizations, such as the YMCA, testify as to their advocacy activities.  CEC will continue to keep you apprised of the progress of this legislation.    <P>

<B><U>English as the Official Language</B><P>
     </U>There have been bills introduced in Congress that would mandate English as the official language of the United States.  Hearings are being held in the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families about the legislation.  H.R. 1005, sponsored by Rep. King (R-NY), Rep. Istook (R-OK), and Rep. Johnson (R-TX), would declare English as the official language, require government publications -- including income tax forms and informational materials -- to be printed only in English, and repeal the Bilingual Education Act.   The bill would also mandate all public ceremonies in which the oath of allegiance is administered to be conducted in English only.  H.R. 739 sponsored by Rep. Roth (R-WI) and 25 other Representatives would also include those provisions, but would additionally require an English language proficiency standard for all applicants for citizenship.<P>
     CEC is very concerned that this legislation would repeal the Bilingual Education Act and thus terminate all federal funding for bilingual education programs.  While we understand the goal of English proficiency, terminating the funding for programs used by schools to teach children English seems to be contradictory.  As always, we will keep you apprised of continuing developments.<P>

<B><U>Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act</B><P>
     </U>On October 26 a House hearing was held on legislation introduced by Representatives Largent (R-OK) and Parker (D-MS) in the House, and Senators Grassely (R-IA), Lott (R-MS), Helms (R-NC), and Cochran (R-MS) in the Senate, that would establish protections for families from "intrusive" government action.  S. 984 and H.R. 1946 would establish the right of parents to direct the upbringing of a child, including: directing or providing for the education of the child; making a health care decision for the child; disciplining the child, including reasonable corporal discipline; and directing or providing for the religious teaching of the child.  The legislation does make an exception for parental decisions that will result in danger or serious physical injury to the child, or behaviors by the parent that constitute abuse or neglect as defined by State law.  The bill prohibits Federal, State, or local government from interfering with or usurping the right of a parent to direct the upbringing of their child.  In order for the government to interfere, the government must be able to demonstrate, by appropriate evidence, that the action is essential to accomplish a compelling governmental interest and that the action is the least restrictive means of accomplishing the compelling interest. <P>
     Proponents of the legislation argue that overly zealous child protection services and schools have usurped the rights of parents in dealing with their children and there is a need to further establish the rights of parents and protect families from intrusive governmental agencies.  Alarmingly, as examples of "intrusive" behavior of governmental agencies, proponents brought up school counseling without the consent of the parent.  Opponents of the legislation, including the National PTA, argue that the legislation is too broad, very vague and will result in a "chilling effect" that will allow more victims of abuse and neglect to go unprotected.  <P>
     CEC strongly supports the rights of parents in raising their children; however, CEC also believes in the rights of children to free, appropriate, and public education.  It is also the right of a child to be raised in a safe and nurturing environment.  The legislation as currently drafted seems to further restrict government agencies from ensuring the safety and well-being of children.  Furthermore, children need to be able to consult with a school counselor unimpeded by a requirement for parental consent.  Children having problems within their families may not feel comfortable asking for such permission before seeking advice and assistance from a school counselor.  We will keep you posted as this legislation moves forward.   <U><BR>

<B>Medicaid</B></U><P>
     Medicaid funding is used by families and schools to provide needed medical services to low- income families, children, and children with disabilities. Currently, if a child is eligible for Medicaid, schools can file for reimbursement for school-based health services.  Some of these services are required by IEPs and would need to be paid for under IDEA funds or locally if not funded by Medicaid.  Chicago Public Schools serve as an example of effective use of Medicaid funds to assist school children.  Last year they billed more than twice as much to Medicaid as they did to IDEA.  Loss of Medicaid funds would devastate Chicago Public Schools and they children they serve.  How will the potential losses hit your school?     <P>
<B>Current Medicaid Law  </B>--  Medicaid is a joint federal/state matching entitlement program that pays for medical services for low-income persons in certain categories, including the aged, families with dependent children, certain pregnant women, children, and individuals with disabilities.  At least 50% of allowable state Medicare costs are reimbursed by the federal government. This federal cost nearly doubled between 1990 and 1994.  Under current law, this spending would be likely to continue increasing rapidly.  A valid criticism of current law is that reimbursement is so complex that some schools don't utilize the resources.  There are stories of districts paying 15-20% of billable reimbursements to consultants to have them set up reimbursement programs.<P>
     Eligibility for Medicaid funding is means-tested based on income and resources.  The standards vary among states.  Current federal law mandates Medicaid to cover certain groups, while states determine from a list of others which populations will be granted eligibility.  States set their own payment methods and rates within federal guidelines.     <P>
     A key provision in current law is the requirement that Medicaid reimburse for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services.  States have some discretion in allowable EPSDT expenses, but they have been used for physical exams, immunizations, laboratory tests, vision and hearing screening and services, dental services, and case management.  Neither of the Congressional plans require states to offer EPSDT services.<P>
<B>The Current Status of Medicaid Reform Efforts</B> -- The House and Senate passed their budget reconciliation bills at the end of October (see earlier article on reconciliation).  These vast pieces of legislation will attempt to cut federal spending for FY 1996 through 2002.  As one part of the reconciliation bill, Congress' goal is to limit Medicaid funding growth.  However, the potential positive effects of limiting the growth -- weighed against the potential harm to needy individuals -- has made the Medicaid provisions a prominent part of the budget battle this year. Both the House and Senate bills eliminate the requirement that states offer EPSDT reimbursement.  A conference committee will iron out the differences in the House and Senate bills.<P>
<B>Differences in the bills</B> --  An amendment offered by Senator Chafee (R-RI) restored in the Senate bill language assuring coverage for children under 13, low-income persons with disabilities, and pregnant women.  There has been some concern raised in the disability community that the language in this amendment may not be strong enough to have the effect of fully restoring the entitlement for these groups, but it is a positive step that we hope will be built upon in conference.  Both bills allow states much broader latitude in determining who qualifies and what services will be funded.  President Clinton <BR>
has vowed to veto any bill that eliminates the safety net for children and cuts welfare spending too deeply.  He has vowed to veto either version of the bill as they stand.   <P>
<B>Welfare Reform</B> -- The House has opted to eliminate Federally run welfare programs in favor of six block grants to states, saving an estimated $90 billion over seven years.  The Senate version includes only two block grants, at an estimated savings of $66 billion.  The federal savings in the two bills would be used to reduce the federal deficit and to make up for tax cuts also included in the budget reconciliation bill.   The Senate bill requires states to continue welfare spending at at least 80% of current levels, while the House bill makes no such provision.  While some welfare provisions are currently being negotiated separately, they are expected to be put back into the overall budget reconciliation bill.<P>
<B>The Message -- </B>Many education groups and other service providers hope Congress will get the message that <I>sick kids don't learn</I>.  Although the extent to which Medicaid funding is utilized varies greatly by state and district, services provided by Medicaid assist students in all communities.  In some cases, a school's nurse is funded fully through Medicaid.  In other cases, immunization and screening programs (such as vision and hearing) are funded under the current program.  These types of services would be at great risk under either Congressional plan.   Many Part H (infant and toddler) programs are funded in large part by Medicaid.  They would be in jeopardy if either these bills were to pass as is.<P>
     Although the data are not available to do a state-by-state breakdown of the educational effects of these bills, it is known that a large number of districts receive more Medicaid monies than IDEA monies.  It is estimated that in 1994 New York City schools received over $80 million dollars in Medicaid assistance and that Chicago schools received $40 million.  Given the fiscal and social challenges faced by many urban school districts, the end of federal entitlements for needy children could have a tremendous consequences.  <P>
     A great number of families of children with disabilities or chronic health problems receive Medicaid-funded services at home or in their communities.  These services often make it possible for a child to live at home rather than in a residential facility.  If communities and families lose these services, schools may see a rise in costly residential placements.  This would be counter to all of the efforts to keep families together and to inclusion.      <P>
     If block grants are the future of Medicaid funding (and it looks like this is the case), two provisions have been suggested which could be added after the anticipated veto would be very helpful in saving the safety net for children: <P>
&iuml;     retain entitlements for children<BR>
&iuml;     entitle school districts to file claims directly for block granted money<BR>
<BR>
     Currently, billing for services is so complex that some have reported years of preparation before a district can begin filing claims.  Consequently, the percentages of school districts receiving Medicaid funds vary greatly.  It has been reported that in 1993 only 31% of Pennsylvania districts filed for Medicaid monies, while 90% of South Carolina districts were billing.   Entitlements for children are essential to providing families, schools, and communities with the support they need.  A well-devised direct billing option could greatly simplify the billing process and might result in more districts taking advantage of Medicaid funds.  <P>
<B>Further Complication</B> -- Block grants will result in many constituencies fighting for the same state- controlled dollars.  Advocates for children will be pitted against those who rightly are concerned with the needs of senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and those who are poor.  These bills will literally pit children against their grandparents.  Who will convince state lawmakers to protect children if we can't collectively succeed in saving their safety net on Capital Hill?  <P>
     Cuts directly effecting children include health care, education, supplemental security (SSI), Head Start, food stamps, school lunch and WIC, child care, and more.  An estimated 900,000 children qualify for Medicaid by virtue of their SSI: 150,000-200,000 children will lose SSI eligibility under the plans.  The safeguards of IDEA may help children at school, but without support for their families it has been suggested that some families will not be able to keep their disabled or medically fragile children at home. Institutional placements, which are very expensive and separate families, may be on the increase.       <BR>
<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE BRANCH UPDATE </B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><U>17th Annual Report to Congress</B></U><P>
     The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) <I>17th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA</I> was released this week.  It contains data regarding all aspects of special education and is available through the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), or contact OSEP at the U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Ave., SW, Switzer Building-Third Floor, Washington, DC 20202-2644.  <P>
<B>Summary</B> -- In 1993-94,  5,373,077 children were served under Part B and Chapter 1.  The 4.2% increase from the prior year represents the largest yearly increase in the history of IDEA.   Students with learning disabilities once again account for more than half of students with disabilities.  The fastest growing categories include traumatic brain injuries, autism, and other health impairments (including ADD).  The department reports a decrease in resource room use and an increase of regular classroom placements by almost 10% over the last 5 years (see <B>Attachment III</B>).<P>
     National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) data indicate that nearly all youth with disabilities had access to vocational education in secondary school.  The American Council on Education reports that 8.8% of entering college freshman in 1991 had disabilities.  This proportion has quadrupled from 2.2% in 1978. <P>
     Look for further reports on this important document in future CAN mailings.<P>

Administration Prints Two Booklets on Budget Effects on Children</B></U><P>
     On October 23, the administration released two documents on the effects on children of the Republican budget and the President's budget. The first, entitled <I>Impact of the Republican Budget Cuts on Children,</I> offers a state-by-state analysis of the effects upon children of the Republicans' budget.  See <B>Attachment IV</B> for the Florida analysis.   The second, <I>A Balanced Budget that Puts Children First</I>, outlines the President's budget (see<B> Attachment V</B>).  Among the many claims made by the administration is that its bill:<P>
&iuml;     "preserves the Medicaid program as a guaranteed safety-net for all children"<BR>
&iuml;     "continues initiatives to reduce infant mortality..."<BR>
&iuml;     "maintains full funding for the Vaccines for Children program"<BR>
&iuml;     "maintains cash benefits for all eligible disabled children"<BR>
&iuml;     "adds 32,000 new Head Start children next year."<BR>
<BR>
     If the President carries out his veto threat, he and Congress will need to come to closer agreement.  We need to inform the White House as well as our members on Capitol Hill that any budget acceptable to the American people will need to be responsive to the needs of children.<P>

<B><U>Million Man March Addresses Education Issues</U> </B><P>
     According to an article in <I>Education Week</I>, educational concerns were frequently raised in the speeches given at the recent Washington march of hundreds of thousands of African American men.  The Reverend Jesse Jackson and Rep. Donald M. Payne (D-N.J.) were among those who mentioned the poor educational showing of black males and called the nation to task for not developing the talent of this huge population.  Federal programs designed to develop talents of the nation's undereducated (from Head Start to the Javits Gifted and Talent Act) have taken a beating in 1995.<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>IN THE COURTS</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><U>Pennsylvania</B></U>: Pennsylvania's Eastern District Court has certified that a population of school age students do constitute a class and therefore suit can be filed on behalf of the class against the state department of education.  The claim of the students, parents, and advocacy groups comprising the plaintiffs is that the state has failed to provide adequate services, supplementary aids, and training to personnel.  The class has been identified as all present and future Pennsylvania school age children with disabilities who have not been given the option for FAPE in regular classrooms or who have been placed in regular educational classrooms without the instruction, accommodations, and services needed to succeed.  <P>
<I>Implications</I>: This challenge to Pennsylvania's special education practices could have widespread influence as a precedent. The complaint is common that students are placed in inclusion settings without support services or under the supervision of teachers or staff without sufficient training or support to provide FAPE.   <P>
<CENTER><I>Information</I>: For reports of the court rulings on this case, consult 23 IDELR 61, 22 IDELR 789, and 22 IDELR 702.

<B>Additional Lobbying Tips</B><P>
     All of you have read -- and memorized -- both the 1993 PAN Handbook and the <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I>, right?!!!  Well, here are a few other tips that you might find helpful.  Some of it repeats what's in the <I>Handbook</I>, and some of it may give you a different spin on lobbying techniques.  Either way, we hope you find it helpful.<P>

&iuml;     information<BR>
&iuml;     praise and constructive criticism<BR>
&iuml;     a sense of community sentiment<BR>
&iuml;     identification of special community groups<BR>
&iuml;     votes<BR>
<BR>
<B>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO LOBBY?</B><P>
     All of us lobby every day when we try to influence other people's decisions.  Some people are paid to try and influence legislative decisions.  But there are lots of others who at one time or another have a need to lobby for or against a bill -- either for themselves, or for the groups they represent.  <P>
     Just as not all of those who lobby are paid, so not all lobbying happens in the Office of Hearing Rooms on Capitol Hill.  It happens in local offices; in people's living rooms; through phone calls, letters, e-mail, faxes, and telegrams; at social events; and at community meetings.<P>
<B>WHAT ARE THE LOBBYING GROUND RULES?</B><P>
     Paid lobbyists and those who spend money on lobbying must follow specific legal requirements (these requirements may change if the Istook Amendment passes -- see "Restrictions on Advocacy Activities for Non-Profit Organizations" on page 7).  The rest of us need to use our knowledge and concern about "our" issues, our common sense, and our courtesy.  Some basic rules to follow are:<P>
&iuml;     Never give bad information.  If you lose your credibility, you lose your power.  If someone asks a question and you don't know the answer, tell them you'll find out and get back to them by a specific time.  (This goes hand-in-hand with "Don't make promises you can't keep.")<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Plan in advance, and be concise.  Legislators are very busy people.  Whenever possible, schedule meetings in advance and be on time.  Plan in advance to: introduce yourself, describe the group (if any) that you're representing and tell how many members there are, explain very clearly what your issue is and why you think he/she should support you, tell exactly what you want her/him to do.  Arrange for a follow-up with the legislator or with a specific staff member.  <BR>

     Leave your name, address, phone number, and any written information that<BR>
     you have on the issue.<P>
&iuml;     Do your homework.  Remember that legislators review thousands of bills each session.  You are more than likely more of an expert on the issue than he/she is.  Make sure you've thought about arguments against your position and are prepared to respond to them.  Learn more about the legislator (her or his profession, business interests, legislative and community committees, voting record on related issues, etc.).<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Develop working relationships with staff members, including secretaries.  Don't make the mistake of ignoring people who can be very helpful.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Be positive.  Confrontations aren't usually useful, except as a last resort.  It's best to find some point of agreement.  If she/he won't support your position entirely, would he/she be willing to go part of the way?  Think through in advance how far you and your group might be willing to compromise and be prepared to give a little.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Get supportive legislators to talk to other legislators for you.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Don't always call just when you need something.  As often as possible, call just to say hello or say thanks.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     If you're doing media work or community meetings, offer to include supportive legislators.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Develop both quantity and quality of contacts.  Some legislators value 100 postcards on the issue.  Others prefer one or two well-written letters.  The key is to generate both.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     GET INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS!!!  As an individual (or if possible, as a group), work for the re-election of your legislative supporters.  If you feel that your interests are unrepresented, get involved in party policy committees and even consider running for office yourself.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WRITING YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS</B><P>
     Depending on timing and the particular issue, telephone calls, e-mails, mailgrams, postcards, and petitions are all appropriate methods of communicating with legislators.  But in general, the most effective way to get your legislator's attention, convince him/her of your concern, and get his/her vote, is through timely, thoughtful, well-written letters.  <P>
     You don't need to be an expert on an issue, either.  Thoughtfully expressing your views as a concerned citizen and constituent can have an impact.  Even a handful of letters can win the support of a Senator or Representative who is wavering on crucial legislation.  Here are a few tips on writing effective letters:<P>

     If you're not sure who your Senator or Representative is, call CEC's DPP or the League of Women Voters toll-free at 1-800-692-7281 or call your County Bureau of Elections (for your state).  Your voter registration card will tell you your "ward" number and "district" number.  For the name and number of your U.S. representatives, call CEC's Department of Public Policy at (703) 264-9498.<P>
<CENTER><B>How to Make Sure Your Letter Counts</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     Write about one issue only.  If you're writing about a specific bill, try to give the bill number or the name the bill is known by (e.g., IDEA Amendments of 1995).<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Write on your own personal stationery, unless you've been asked to write a letter as the spokesperson for your organization.  If you are the spokesperson, write on the organization's letterhead and try to give an approximate number of people in the organization.<BR>

<BR>
&iuml;     Make your letter brief and easy to read.  It should almost never be more than two pages.  One page is best.  Stick to the main points.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Tell your position on the issue and why you hold that position.  Your reasons are very important.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Share your personal experiences.  Tell how the bill or the action will affect you, your relatives, friends, or neighbors.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Ask for the legislator's position on the issue in addition to urging specific action.  Ask for a commitment.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Be as positive as you can.  If you disagree, make constructive suggestions on how the bill or problem can be improved or eliminated.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Write follow-up letters if necessary: to confirm the legislator's position, to ask questions if his/her letter was unclear, etc.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Always write thank-you letters when your legislator has taken the right position or done something you appreciate.<BR>
