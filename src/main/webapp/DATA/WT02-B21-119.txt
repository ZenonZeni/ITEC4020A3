&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With each new edition of our newsletter, we often receive calls from clients questioning the appearance or disappearance of the notation "<I>waitlisted</I>" next to certain programs on our Travel Calendar. It is true that some of our programs seem to fill almost as soon as they are announced, only to be available for booking once again several months later. I hope that the following explanation will help.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because we announce our departures so far in advance (twelve to eighteen months in most cases) we often get swamped with bookings from enthusiastic clients before we even have a chance to mail a brochure! Then, as the months pass, reunions, births, weddings and other obligations create scheduling conflicts, and some who book a year or more in advance end up having to cancel their reservation. Furthermore, some space originally set aside for special interest groups may become available four to six months prior to a departure.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is our policy not to oversell our programs, so once every space is spoken for, we start a waitlist, which is monitored very carefully by our Program Managers. Unfortunately, many people feel that being put on a waitlist means there is only a very slim possibility that they will have the opportunity to participate in the program. They therefore proceed with making other plans.<RB>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More often than not, every person on a waitlist is eventually called and offered space on the departure. Our 1997 spring Polynesia expeditions are a good example: After our initial announcement of these departures, all 135 berths aboard the <I>Wind Song</I> filled immediately, and a long waitlist formed. Then, after half a year, we had some space open up and began to call those on the waitlist. What we found was that, even though we were still more than five months away from departure, many people had assumed that space would not become available and had already made other arrangements. The result is that currently we have three or four cabins available on each voyage.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, every departure is different, and there is a greater chance that space will become available on a 135-passenger chartered vessel than on a smaller land or sea program. In all cases, we can give a definite answer about space availability at least three to four months prior to departure, so if you are placed on a waitlist for a program, <B><I>don't you dare book alternative arrangements!</I></B> Hang in there, call our Program Managers as often as you wish for an update, and chances are we will welcome you along on the program of your choice!<BR>

We hope you enjoy this edition of Zegrahm News.<BR>
