<H3><CENTER><A NAME=real>Surrogacy in the 1990s<BR>The Real
Story</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The common perception of surrogacy-what it is, who does it, and how it
works-has seeped into the public consciousness by way of sensationalized
news headlines and aftemoon talk shows, via politicians who find it expedient
to denounce surrogacy, and from religious, pseudo-feminist and antiabortion
groups whose tenets require women to abdicate the right and responsibility
to control their own bodies. Those who speak out the loudest against surrogacy
seem to know the least about it. Few have ever faced the devastation of
infertility themselves. Yet seldom have they included infertile couples or
surrogate mothers in public policy-making decisions about surrogacy.
<P>
<H4>SURROGACY WORKS<BR>99% Success Rate
</H4><P>Understandably, an infertile couple trying to resolve childlessness
would be hesitant to pursue surrogacy without accurate information and reliable
resources. But any enquiring mind delving deeper than NationalEnquirer headlines
would discover that surrogacy works! According to the health department of
the state of New York's estimate of approximately 4000 surrogate births since
the late 1970's, only 11 documented cases involving custody of the child
have gone to litigation, and in every case except one, custody has been awarded
to the intended parents. Compared to other forms of social contract such
as marriage or adoption, surrogacy enjoys a significantly higher success
rate (over 99%). The 1992 Information Please Almanac states that in 1990,
there were approximately 2,448,000 marriages in the U.S., and 1,175,000
divorces-a failure rate of almost 50%. In adoption, one study conducted by
adoption specialist <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Carol">Carol Wolfe</A>, MFCC, found
that out of 250 birthmothers who had agreed to place their child with prospective
adoptive parents, in 38% of these cases, one or the other party withdrew
from the agreement prior to or following the birth. (This differs from the
often-quoted figure of 5 - 15% of birthmothers who change their mind after
the birth.)
<P>
<H4>GESTATIONAL SURROGACY<BR>"...a second wave of surrogate mothers..."
</H4><P>Not only is traditional Artificial Insemination surrogacy highly
successful, but according to a front-page article in the August 12, 1990
issue of The New York Times,"surrogacy is not only actively practiced but
expanding in a new direction, bringing hope to some families... ." This new
direction, which the Times heralds as the "second wave of surrogate mothers"
is gestational surrogacy, in which a woman carries an infertile couple's
embryo and delivers a baby to whom she has no genetic connection. The article
also interviews internationally recognized infertility specialists Drs. Richard
Marrs and Paulo Serafini who perform embryo transfers into gestational surrogate
mothers when medically indicated. The Ethics Committee of the American Fertility
Society states "there could be a role for surrogate gestation in reproductive
medicine." The Times quotes Lori B. Andrews, a lawyer specializing in
reproductive law at the American Bar Foundation. "This is a growing area
of surrogacy... more in vitro fertilization centers are offering it, and
more couples are drawn to it." Clearly, growing acceptance within the medical
community has moved surrogacy from the media spotlight into the medical joumals.
<P>
<H4>PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS
</H4><P>Professional surrogate practitioners can now provide full-service
programs which address every aspect of the process. At the Center for Surrogate
Parenting, comprehensive case management of each couple and surrogate mother
ensures the best possible outcome for all parties. This means independent
legal counsel for both surrogate and couple, complete medical screening,
ongoing psychological counseling for all participants, and finaricial management
to insure that all fees, insurance and anticipated expenses are covered.
<P>Surrogacy has moved beyond the shadows and innuendo of the tabloids and
talkshows, emerging in the 1990's as an established practice offering real
solutions for creating families.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=experiences>Surrogate Mothers Compare
Experiences</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Independent Arrangements vs. Professional Surrogacy
Programs</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Three surrogate mothers share insights gained by working both independently
and through professional programs. All expressed the hope that their experiences
will prove helpful to women considering becoming surrogate mothers.
<P>
<H4>"Susan"
</H4><P>Susan wanted to be a surrogate mother ever since the day her own
child was born, after learning that the woman in the hospital room next to
her had tried to take her own life. The woman's child had been stillborn,
necessitating an emergency hysterectomy. Susan placed an ad in her local
paper, using her home phone number, offering to become a surrogate mother
for an infertile couple. She received many calls. Using her own intuition
and good sense, she screened the couples herself, finally selecting a warm
and deserving couple. They had no contract, the agreement was sealed with
a handshake. After the third insemination, Susan became pregnant. The wife,
whose doctor had suggested surrogacy since she had severe tubal damage, became
pregnant herself when Susan was three months pregnant. The couple was wonderful,
insisting they were thrilled with two children. Susan gave birth to a boy,
the wife a girl. All parties honored their agreement and the experience was
a great success.
<P>Only after researching surrogacy for a college paper did Susan realize
how perilous her situation had been and how very fortunate she was in its
outcome. The second time around she worked through a professional surrogacy
agency which offered her far better protection against unforeseen events.
She noted that doing it on her own made the process appear less expensive
for the couple, and she could see no real advantages for the surrogate.
<P>
<H4>"April"
</H4><P>April loved being pregnant but a messy divorce made being a single
mother a tremendous burden. She wanted to have a child for someone who could
really enjoy motherhood. She felt confused and ambiguous about being paid
for this service. After becoming involved with a professional surrogate agency,
it became clear to her that she was being paid for her services, not a child.
She felt comforted that the agency took care of all legal matters, screened
the couples for social diseases, and provided ongoing counseling and support.
She was matched with a couple and the three of them produced a beautiful
baby boy. The experience was so successful that two years later, they all
tried again, but this time they felt confident that they could do it on their
own. April became pregnant with twins. In retrospect, April felt the main
problem was that they all had become too close, taking too much for granted.
Communication broke down - everyone was afraid to say what he or she was
really feeling, or to ask for what was needed. Money was an uncomfortable
subject. The birth was an emotional rollercoaster - the couple, unprepared
for twins, April desperately needing to hear a "thank you." She says she
wants to be a surrogate one more time, to end on a positive experience. This
time she wants to go through a professional program. "I will never do it
any other way!"
<P>
<H4>"Emily"
</H4><P>Suffering two years of infertility herself, Emily wanted to help
a childless couple after completing her own family. She found a reputable
surrogate agency and helped two infertile couples to become families.
Subsequently she was contacted by a couple who offered her more money to
work with them independently. Because of her previous successful experiences,
she felt confident about doing it on her own and agreed. Once she became
pregnant, the couple could "see I had no back-up. They were very nice to
me until they got what they wanted." After the birth, they refused to pay
the balance of her fee as well as the obstetrician's bill of several thousand
dollars, which Emily eventually paid herself. Her husband insists she work
through a surrogate program the next time.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=frozen>International Frozen Embryo Shipping Program A
Success</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Customs Agent Plays Crucial Role</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>As our international clientele expands and the technology of embryo freezing
advances, the Center's program has opened the door to international shipment
of frozen embryos. This allows couples who live in countries with socialized
medicine, such as Israel, Australia and England, to create embryos less
expensively. It also reduces the travel expenses and emotional rigors of
long distance, third-party cycle synchronization. So far, our program has
produced two births from embryos shipped from England and Australia, with
another five couples currently in the process.
<P>Our customs agent is responsible for all aspects of shipping, from filing
complicated customs paperwork and fee payment, to pickup and delivery to
respective doctors. Because the embryos are shipped in liquid nitrogen, which
is considered a "hazardous material" it requires special clearances. Contents
are referred to as "human tissue", the client's name never appearing on any
of the forms. In addition, the agent must make special preparations to insure
the embryos are not x-rayed. Direct routes must be booked and detailed knowledge
of suitable airlines is essential.
<P>We hope to be shipping embryos from Japan soon, as worldwide interest
in this option continues to grow.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=issues>Issues and Inquiries</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Preconceptions About Surrogacy<BR>The Center Asks Its Infertile
Couples ...</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<H4>Q. What was your initial reaction to surrogate parenting?
</H4><P>A. &#160;In the beginning stages of exploring this option, most couples
were aware of the negative press surrogacy had received, fueling their main
fear that the surrogate mother would have problems relinquishing the baby.
Several couples also worried that their own relationship would be adversely
affected, since the wife, in the case of artificial insemination, would have
no genetic connection to the child. Other concerns were that it might be
exploitative of the surrogate, or that the whole process was just too
complicated. Many couples were positive about surrogacy. They believed it
was neither the government's nor the public's business to interfere in this
very private area of their lives. They saw it as a win/win situation for
all participants.
<H4>Q. At what point did you decide to pursue surrogate parenting?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>Several of the couples maintained that the turning point
occurred after meeting with the Center's psychologist and staff. Becoming
informed about surrogacy, knowing that the surrogate mothers were well-screened,
both medically and psychologically, and meeting other couples who had
surrogate-born children, all contributed to a decision to move forward with
surrogacy. All felt that good mental health professionals were at the heart
of the process. In addition, couples were reassured by the Center's full-service
program which provided comprehensive legal, financial, and case management
of the arrangement.
<H4>Q. How did your feelings about surrogacy change once you became involved?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>"Surprised" is the word most often used by couples to describe
their feelings about surrogacy once their child is born. They are surprised
by their feelings toward their surrogate mother. One wife, who helped deliver
their baby, said she felt an intense love and connection with the surrogate.
Couples report that they knew would feel indebted to her, but they were surprised
at how much they learned from her and the high regard they felt for her as
a person. One wife who was worried about the possible exploitative nature
of surrogacy, was amazed to discover how many benefits the surrogate mother
enjoyed, independent of the financial aspects. She watched her own surrogate
grow in confidence, having managed and completed the surrogate process with
such success. She also felt having the extra money was very empowering and
allowed her to think more broadly regarding her life's choices. Another couple
noted that all parties had grown and changed, having learned a great deal
from each other.
<P>Another common "surprise" reported by most couples was the desire to "let
the world know." They were intentionally open about the circumstances of
their child's birth.
<P>Several couples also believed that people should be discouraged from pursuing
surrogacy on their own. There could be too many unanticipated twists and
turns. They also felt strongly the need for some kind of legal guidelines
and regulation.
<P>There was a general concurrence that surrogacy was a synergistic experience.
The process itself transformed participant's lives in many ways, enriching,
empowering and enlightening all who took part.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=more>More than just one child...</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Family Building Solutions</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Center For Surrogate Parenting salutes the ingenuity and determination
of its infertile couples who have decided to have more than one child. The
following are examples of some unique family combinations created by our
clients using adoption, surrogacy and high-tech reproductive technology:<BR>
<UL><LI>Three children - one "homemade" child, one adopted child, one
surrogate-born child.<BR>
<LI>Fraternal quadruplets, born through gestational surrogacy, from embryos
placed into two different surrogate mothers at the same time. One had triplets,
the other a single baby.<BR>
<LI>Twins, a boy and a girl, from the same egg retrieval, one embryo placed
into a gestational surrogate, the other embryo returned to the biological
mother.<BR>
<LI>One surrogate-born child and one child the result of an egg donated by
the same surrogate mother but carried by the infertile wife.<BR>
<LI>Three surrogate-born children, two girls from the same surrogate mother,
and a boy from a second surrogate.<BR>
<LI>Two children a boy and a girl, born with the help of two different
gestational surrogate mothers.
</UL><P>These parents will pass on a legacy of love, faith and courage to
their children. They have given a whole new meaning to the word "family."

<H4>One Way or Another ...
</H4><P>The Center received a lovely thank you letter from a couple who had
joined the Center's Gestational Surrogacy Program. Although the embryo transfer
into their surrogate mother had not produced a pregnancy, the leftover embryos
transferred back into the biological mother did! Congratulations Mom!
<H4>Genetic Testing
</H4><P>Genetic testing has become an integral part of the Center's screening
process. Dr. Ann Garber, a Certified Geneticist, has developed a genetic
history for completion by all participants in the Artificial Insemination
Surrogacy and Egg Donation Programs. Dr. Garber reviews all completed histories
and provides a written assessment for each individual.
<H4>Standardized STD Testing
</H4><P>Working with Smith Kline Beecham Laboratories, the Center has
standardized the testing of surrogates and couples for sexually transmitted
diseases. Special specimen packets have been developed for our clients to
take to their own physicians, who perform the necessary tests and ship them
to Smith Kline Labs. The results are then printed across a teleprinter directly
to the Center and evaluated by our Medical Coordinator.
<H4>Israel, France, and Japan
</H4><P>Once again the Center will submit for presentation at the 8th World
Congress on IVF and Assisted Reproduction in Kyoto, Japan, its updated paper,
"<A HREF=Handel.html>Success Rate of Surrogate Gestational Pregnancies Using
In Vitro Fertilization Donor Oocytes</A>" which they have previously presented
at the 6th and 7th World IVF Congresses in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Paris, France.
<H4>Its A Small World!
</H4><P>One of our clients tells a story about how her father, who was waiting
for a connecting flight in a Colorado airport in the middle of the night,
happened to strike up a conversation with the only other person in the terminal,
a woman also waiting for a flight. They began talking about their grandchildren.
The woman's daughter had just given birth to her first granddaughter. Our
client's father talked about his granddaughter and a new grandson that would
be born in a few months. Eventually, all the waiting and talking produced
the amazing revelation that all their respective grandchildren were conceived
with the help of gestational surrogate mothers!

</H3><P>
<H4>DES Patients Can Benefit from Gestational Surrogacy
</H4><P>Dr. David Meldrum from the Center for Advanced Reproductive Care
in Redondo Beach, California, reports in Fertility and Sterility, 54:287,
1990, that physicians should be aware of the marked reduction of viable pregnancy
with IVF in DES exposed women with uterine abnormalities other than a small
uterus. Rates were decreased to as low as one third of controls with T-shape,
constrictions or irregular margins.
<H4>Microfertilization Success
</H4><P>Huntington Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California, under the
direction of Drs. Paulo Serafini and Joel Batzofin, has perfected two procedures,
PZD (Partial Zone Drilling) and SUZI (Sub-Zonal Sperm Injection), which allows
the management of previously untreatable male factor fertility. Their pregnancy
rate is 35% for PZD and 43% for SUZI. As of August 1992, they have had nine
live births with thirteen pregnancies ongoing.
<H4>Immunologic Response Treatment Achieves Pregnancy
</H4><P>The Center is pleased to announce a pregnancy for a client following
immunologic response treatment of their surrogate at the University of Utah.
The client had attempted several inseminations with their surrogate before
determining that the surrogate had a negative percentage inhibition response
and no blocking activity on a mixed lymphocyte culture with the donor. After
two months of treatment their surrogate became pregnant and subsequently
gave birth to a healthy baby boy.
<H4>Egg Donation Success in Women Over Forty
</H4><P>Drs. Jacobson, Galen and Weckstein of the Bay Area Fertility Medical
Group in the San Francisco East Bay, report on the success of their egg donor
program in recipients over forty. To date, they have achieved 14
ongoing/delivered pregnancies in 35 completed cycles, representing a 40%
success rate. Donors can be provided or couples are welcome to work with
their egg donors.
