<H2>Ethnobotany and<BR>The Shaman's Apprentice Program</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
At the heart of the Suriname Biodiversity Prospecting Initiative is ethnobotany, the study of traditional uses of plants within indigenous communities.  While new drugs can be found through the process of random screening, studies show that plants already identified by indigenous people are up to 60 percent more likely to have pharmaceutical potential than randomly collected plant samples.
<P>
For indigenous people, the forest serves as a source not only of medicines, but a myriad of other everyday products, including foods, oils, latexes, and fibers.  Many of these products can be harvested without destroying a single plant, much less an entire ecosystem. 

<H3>The Problem</H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, the cultures that know and use their forests so well are vanishing today. While many species of rain forest plants face certain extinction, the knowledge of how to use these plants is disappearing even faster.
<P>
With a number of deadly diseases still left to conquer, society cannot afford to lose this indigenous knowledge of the medical uses of plants. Already, one in every twelve prescription drugs sold in U.S. pharmacies is derived from tropical plants, and the value of these drugs is estimated to be about $3 billion per year. Moreover, one-third of all plant-derived prescription drugs come from rain forest species. 
<P>
After decades of focusing almost exclusively on synthetics,  the pharmaceutical industry is again showing interest in developing medicines from tropical plants. Yet these investigations, while unquestionably valuable for the industrialized world, do not always benefit the indigenous peoples themselves.

<H3>A Solution</H3>

Conservation International has established the Shaman's Apprentice Program.  By providing grants to Shaman's Apprentices -- young men and women within forest societies who work with and learn from tribal medicine men and midwives -- the program encourages the transfer of traditional knowledge  to the next generation.  Other program efforts include:

<UL>
<LI>supporting the collection of plant specimens for herbaria and recording scientific descriptions in computerized ethnobotanical archives;
<LI>convening workshops for shamans from different tribal and cultural groups;
<LI>sponsoring the establishment of medicinal plant gardens for both educational and medical purposes within forest and rural communities. 
</UL>
     
<P>
The main goal of the Shaman's Apprentice Program is to preserve and perpetuate indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants and other rain forest products.  Additionally, the program seeks to create mechanisms through which indigenous people can obtain direct benefits from their knowledge about the forest, to promote viable health alternatives where Western medicine is unavailable or inaccessible, and to integrate indigenous and other rural communities into protected area
management.</BLOCKQUOTE>
