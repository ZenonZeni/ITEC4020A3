<hr><FONT SIZE=2><B>anovulation</B>	total absence of ovulation<p>
<B>corpus luteum</B>	the remaining follicle after ovulation that prepares the uterine lining for implantation by the fertilized egg.<p>
<B>cyropreservation</B>	a procedure used to preserve (by freezing) and store embryos or gametes (sperm, oocyctes).<p>
<B>endometrial biopsy</B>	the extraction of a small piece of tissue from the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for microscopic examination.
<p><b>embryo</b>	the term used to describe the early stages of fetal growth, from conception to the eighth week of pregnancy.
<p><B>estradiol (E2)</B>	a hormone released by developing follicles in the ovary.  Plasma estradiol levels are used to help determine the progressive growth of the follicle during ovulation induction.
<p><B>fallopian tubes</B> 	a pair of narrow tubes that carry the ovum (egg) from the ovary to the body of the uterus.
<p><B>fertilization</B>	the penetration of the egg by the sperm and fusion of genetic materials to result in the development of an embryo.
<p><B>follicle</B>	the fluid-filled sac in the ovary that has nurtured the ripening egg and from which teh egg is released during ovulation.
<p><B>gamete</B>	the male or female reproductive cells - the sperm or the ovum (egg).
<p><B>gamete intrafallopian transfer</B> procedure, performed surgically, where the egg is removed, mixed with washed sperm, and then transferred back into the fallopian tubes where fertilization may take place.
<p><B>hormone</B>	a chemical, produced by an endocrine gland, which circulates in teh blood and has wide spread action throughout the body.
<p><B>hysterosalpingogram</B>	an x-ray procedure in which a special dye is injected into the uterus to illustrate the inner contour of the uterus and degree of openness (patency) of the fallopian tubes.
<p><B>implantation</B>	the embedding of the fertilized egg in the endometrium of the uterus.
<p><B>insemination</B>	the installation of semen into a woman's vagina for the purpose of conception.
<p><B>in vitro fertilization (IVF) </B>	a method of assisted reproduction that involves removing an egg from the ovary, combining it with sperm in a petri dish and, if fertilized, replacing the resulting embryo back into the woman's uterus.
<p><B>laparoscopy</B>	a diagnostic procedure in which a surgeon inserts a laparoscope through a small incision below the naval; he/she then views the exterior surfaces of a woman's reproductive organs and abdominal cavity.
<p><B>oocyte retrieval	</B>	a procedure to collect the eggs contained within the ovarian follicles.  A needle is inserted into the follicle, the fluid and egg are aspirated into the needle, and then placed into a culture medium-filled dish.
<p><B>ovarian failure</B>	the inability of the ovary to respond to any gonadotropic hormone stimulation, usually due to the absence of follicular tissue on a genetic basis or the postmenopausal condition (absence of oocytes).
<p><B>ovary</B>	the sexual gland of the female which produces the hormones estrogen and progesterone, and in which the ova are developed.
<p><B>ovulation</B>	the expulsion of a ripened egg from its follicle in the outer layer of the ovary
<p><B>post-coital tes</B>t	the microscopic analysis of a sample of vaginal and cervical secretions that has been collected soon after sexual intercourse or insemination.
<p><B>progesterone</B>	a hormone secreted by the corpus luteum.
<p><B>sperm</B>	the male reproductive cell.
<p><B>ultrasound</B>	a technique for visualizing the follicles in the ovaries and the fetus in the uterus, allowing the estimation of size.
<p><B>uterus</B>	the reproductive organ that houses, protects and nourishes the developing embryo/fetus.  It is a hollow, muscular structure that is part of the female reproductive tract and is the source of a woman's menses.
<p><B>zona pellucida</B>	the outer covering of the ovum that the sperm must penetrate before fertiliztion can occur.
<p><B>zygote	</B>an embryo in early development stage.
<p><B>zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT)</B>	transfer of a zygote into a fallopian tube (usually done by a laparoscopy).</FONT><br><A HREF="index.htm">home</A>
