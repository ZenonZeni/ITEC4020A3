<p><strong>Communist Party holds emergency summit on saving public education
Issues plan of action to halt right-wing attack on our schools.</strong>


</p><p><em>NEW YORK</em> - Calling public education a "cornerstone of our democratic
structure," the Communist Party USA held an emergency meeting here Saturday,
Sept. 21 to map out a plan of action to save our schools.
</p><p>
CPUSA Vice-Chair Sam Webb, in his opening remarks, said, "Up until now, we
have assumed that the public education system is untouchable. But the
American people can no longer afford to think that way. A section of the
ruling class is ready to scrap our system of public education with the same
ruthlessness that it closes factories, lays off masses of workers, and writes
off formerly thriving cities as bad investments."
</p><p>
Conference participants, including teachers, parents, students and trade
unionists from 10 east coast and Midwest states, denounced vouchers, "choice"
and charter schools, which coupled with cutbacks in government aid for
education, would cripple public education. Webb said, "We should reject
for-profit schools in any form. Children must not be turned into commodities.
Corporations will not solve the education crisis any more than they have
solved the crisis of joblessness."
</p><p>
The conference, which issued a six-point plan of action to defend public
education and preserve democracy, the most immediate task being the defeat of
Dole, Gingrich and the 73 ultra-right House Republicans on Nov. 5.
</p><p>
Webb said, "Getting rid of them would go a long way toward getting rid of the
"whiff of fascism" in the country.
</p><p>
The rest of the CPUSA program includes:
<ul>
<li>No to privatization schemes in any form.
<li>Organize unity coalitions of parents, schoolworkers, students and elected
officials to speak out and defend public education including ads in papers,
press conferences, letters to the editors, and visits to legislators'
offices.
<li>Cut class size to 15 as the first step in school reform. Hire teachers and
support personnel using affirmative action guidelines.
<li>End the use of local property taxes for school funding. Tax the rich and
corporations to pay for quality desegregated education. Reappropriate
military expenditures into the Department of Education.
<li>Pass the Martinez public works jobs bill (HR-1591) which would appropriate
$250 billion, much of it to build new schools and repair old ones.
</ul>
