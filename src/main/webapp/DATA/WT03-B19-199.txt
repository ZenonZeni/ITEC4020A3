<H2>Australia</H2>
Expenditure on education in Australia is around 5 % of gross domestic product. Australia has 3 million school students and 0.6 million students in higher education as well as 1.1 million technical and further education students. Although the education sector's share of the national economy has tended to level out after increasing in the 1960s and 1970s, the demand for higher education services has continued to increase because of rising participation rates.  Around 30% of students now undertake post-school studies compared with 10% a decade ago.
<P>
The quality of the education system is sufficient to attract students from overseas. Education exports have grown from virtually a zero base a decade ago strongly over the past decade and are worth around $2.1 billion. Around half of the $2.1 billion represents education fees and the other half is spending on other goods and services.
<P>
The number of full-fee paying overseas students in Australia increased from about 2,000 in 1986 to 70,000 by 1994, comprising around 8,800 in schools, 46,600 in universities, 5,300 in other post secondary education institutions, 2,600 in TAFE colleges undertaking degree level courses and 6,500 in English language intensive courses run at higher education institutions and TAFE colleges.
<P>
Australia earns around $50 million from the overseas provision of education services. Overseas projects in education services involve the delivery of projects offshore using Australian management and teaching/training experts.  These projects typically take place in Asia-Pacific countries and are paid for by loans to the nation concerned from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Victoria has a relatively high participation rate in upper secondary education compared with the other states and the number of higher education students is at a record high.
<P>
In 1994, there were 21,000 fee-paying students from overseas undertaking courses in Victoria, some 30% of the national total.  Most were from Asia, particularly Hong Kong, Malaysia, the People's Republic of China and Singapore.
<P>
Exports of educational services from Victoria are around $650 million, equal to 50% of spending by foreign tourists in the state.  While the full-fee paying overseas students market is the major export earner, overseas projects involving the packaging of education and training services for delivery in other countries earns around $20 million a year.
<P>
Several Victorian educational institutions are involved in joint ventures with educational institutions overseas to conduct courses for students in their own countries.  Increasing numbers of institutions and companies are also involved in joint arrangements to provide technical, trade and other workforce-related educational services offshore.
<P>
Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria (OPCV) manages a number of aid-funded overseas projects relating to training services and education systems through strategic alliances with education and training organisations.
<P>
In response to the demand from developing countries for access to quality tertiary education and the need to keep costs down, television based distance learning has recently been marketed overseas by Open Learning Agency, a Monash University-led consortium.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
Australia has around 1% of the world market for overseas students which is estimated at US$100 billion a year.  Scope for export expansion lies mainly in the Asia Pacific region.
<P>
Innovative programs in telecommunications and distance learning are being developed and delivered by some Australian organisations.  Opportunities also exist in providing equipment and software relating to publishing and information technology.
<P>
The education and training needs of Asian countries vary enormously and are impacted upon by the various cultural, economic, political and social conditions of each country.
<P>
Those markets which have up to now delivered large number of students to Australia are increasingly demonstrating their desire to develop their own educational infrastructure.  In this context, joint ventures with Asian educators will become increasingly important.
