<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheets-INDEX</TITLE>
<H1>Index to Climate Change Fact 
Sheets</H1>
The 90-plus fact sheets in this section are organised into three series:  Causes, Impacts, 
and International Response.  For more information see the Introduction and the 
forewords by UNEP Executive Director Elizabeth Dowdeswell  and 
WMO Secretary-General G.O.P Obasi.<P>
