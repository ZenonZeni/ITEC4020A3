<p><font size="4">I know that it's been a little while since I
returned something for the last letter you sent me but sometimes
I'm just not in the letter writing mood plus there's not much new
to tell you anyway.&nbsp; It's still the same old fuckery going
on here, it seems like everytime the guards change shifts (the
police change every quarter so we get a few new assholes every
three months) we have to go through a bunch of extra shit until
we break them in or else we just get used to them and learn how
to work around the assholes.&nbsp; It's funny how people learn to
adapt to most any situation and one thing that's good about
suffering is that it forces people to stand together that would
be hating each other under normal circumstances.&nbsp; I also
like to believe the old cliche that &quot;Suffering builds character.&quot;&nbsp;
Sometimes I do wonder though if people that suffer get any reward in
the long run because you see people all over the earth suffering
and they never get any relief.&nbsp; Who knows maybe they get
some kind of blessing that we can't see but like you said
&quot;God is with those with the biggest armies or the most
money.&quot;&nbsp; Of course there has to be suffering to change
wrongs that are being done and when you're suffering for a cause
or something you believe in it can give you a certain pride and
dignity that is a blessing in itself.&nbsp; The difference
between people who know what they're suffering for and people who don't
are like night and day, people that go into suffering sacrificing
and giving up small pleasures to make things better (or a hope of
making things better) in the long run get a self worth and self
respect that is like no other.&nbsp; It's a feeling that a person
gets when they know that they might have some effect on the future
of or on the betterment of the human race.&nbsp; It's this spirit
or desire to change things that has made man progress this far
and have made man willing to give up their lives if necessary for
something they believe in.&nbsp; So my point is that maybe the
blessing that one gets for suffering is the feeling of
satisfaction or self worth that a person feels or maybe suffering
is something that is necessary to make man learn how to live
together in peace and how to better themselves in the long
run.&nbsp; Maybe that's why the Bible says that we should &quot;Bear
our suffering with joy,&quot; maybe our little minds can't
comprehend the blessing that we get because we can't see the big
picture of how mankind benefits through our suffering. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Brother Jeffery wrote me a letter and sent me a few old pictures
the other day which was very nice of him to take the time to
do.&nbsp; However, some of the thanks goes to you because he said
that it was through your letters (or maybe it was through the
&quot;Internet computer system&quot; because he also said
something about that) that he learned that I wanted some old
pictures.&nbsp; I wrote him back and thanked him and I also told
him what I thought led to the brothers' down fall and why I feel
that they haven't been able to resurrect anything.&nbsp; Even though
I was young I saw how things progressed, as I'm sure you know my father
was one of the first white brothers in Jamaica.&nbsp; I knew
brother Ivy, I lived at every house (except the one right before
his death) that &quot;Niah Keith&quot; (with brother Keith and
his family) ever lived at in Jamaica, his children were like brothers
and sisters to me.&nbsp; I lived with brother Wally, Brother
Cootman (that was sister Phyllis's father) and shit I even lived
at brother Dohgie's (Laurenton Dickens's) house (me being the <u>only</u>
white person there) in Bull Bay for about four months (I was
about 9 years old at the time) one time while my parents were in
America.&nbsp; I lived with my family in America at all the
places (I'm sure that you remember that my family lived up in
Maine) where they made the moves and <u>I was at all three</u> of
(the ranch, the Canal and Maine) the big busts and I went to a
juvenile (the Canal and Maine) home on two of them.&nbsp; I'm
just stating all of this to say that I was there from the
beginning (the beginning meaning when the white brothers first
went to Jamaica) so I saw how things manifested through
time.&nbsp; As I told brother Jeffery in my letter to him, the
thing that the brothers had in the beginning that drew them
together, the thing that made them able to work together and
accomplish so much in such a short time was the louv and unity
they had for each other in the beginning.&nbsp; After a while through
the hunger for power and greed certain ones set themselves up on
a pedestal (as big Bob would say &quot;The Elderberries&quot;)
and started to think that they were some how more holy than their
brother.&nbsp; It shifted from equality to some kind of a pecking
order where instead of looking out for their brothers &amp; sisters best
interest all they could do is play politics and think they were
better than other people.&nbsp; Really I think it's a disgrace
how the brothers ended up hating each other, no wonder not even
their own children wanted to live that kind of life style.&nbsp;
What ever you do you can't leave out the youth because young people
are the future so you have to teach them what you know.&nbsp;
That's another thing that the brothers did wrong, with all those
big smart Coptic Priests around it's funny how they didn't teach
the children shit, they should have at least taught us how to
drive those boats, if they would have maybe I wouldn't be here
right now. :-)&nbsp; As I said the only thing that the brothers
had at one time that made them different from the rest of the
world was the louv (that's the spirit that, if used in the right
frame of mind, ganja enhances) so when they lost that for each
other they couldn't set an example for or draw anyone.&nbsp; For the brothers
to ever come together in a spirit again they have to put aside
all the bad thought and hatred that they carry for each
other.&nbsp; How did the old saying go?&nbsp; &quot;Think right
love and pray and you'll live in rejoicing every day.&quot;&nbsp;
Louv is what the world is lacking and that's the key.&nbsp;
Fighting for the freedom of ganja is good but if you can't
display and give people the understanding of the frame of mind
that you're supposed to be in when you smoke it then people might
get the wrong concept (especially young people) of the spirit
that it induces and go on to abuse it just like most everyone
else does.&nbsp; Ganja is a medicine it can be easily
abused.&nbsp; I believe that in the beginning the brothers had
the spirit that the herb enhances but as time went on they lost
that spirit and ganja became the focal point (I know that I
abused it) and that's when they started to abuse it.&nbsp; It doesn't
do any good to point the finger at anybody because we all make mistakes
in life, (what was the old saying, &quot;We all sin and fall
short of the glory of God&quot;) so the idea is to lift each
other and try not to make those same mistakes again.&nbsp; Maybe
one day after the brothers get beat hard enough they'll forget
about the bad feelings that they carry for each other and come
together and have some fun.&nbsp; I'm not going to hold my breath
though. :-(<br>
