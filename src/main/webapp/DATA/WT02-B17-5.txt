<h2>AWARD INSTRUMENT</h2>
<p>
DOE intends to award Cooperative Agreements as a result of this 
solicitation.  The Cooperative Agreement was chosen because:  (a) the 
principal purpose of the anticipated relationship is the transfer of 
money, property, services, or anything of value to a selected applicant 
in order to accomplish a public purpose of support, and (b) substantial 
involvement between DOE and the selected applicant during the performance 
of the project activities is anticipated.  A sample Cooperative Agreement 
is provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Appropriate 
provisions will be negotiated with a selected applicant and incorporated 
in any resulting agreement as determined by the applicant's status (small 
business, large business, for-profit, non-profit, etc.) and particular 
project.
