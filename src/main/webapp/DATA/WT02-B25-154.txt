<h3 align=center><font color="#FF0000">IMAGINING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS</font></h3>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">It's difficult to understand what someone with a mental illness experiences, but this exercise 
may give you a better idea.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><strong>SCHIZOPHRENIA</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Have you ever ...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Gone for 24 hours without sleep? 48 hours? Longer? How did 
you feel after being awake this long? How did you look? </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Dozed off for a second, awakened with a start, and didn't know 
where you were? How did you feel? What would it be like to 
feel that way for a day, a week, several weeks?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Lost your sunglasses or car keys and no matter what you did, 
you couldn't find them? How did it make you feel? Did you feel 
like screaming?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Been driving down the road when suddenly your directions got 
mixed up? North and south reversed or confused? How did you 
feel?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Had a funny little tune going through your mind for a couple of 
hours or a whole day, and no matter what you did it still 
bothered you? How would you feel if that same tune went 
through your mind for three days, a week, a month?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Now put three or more of these items together. Say you hadn't 
slept for three days, your heard the same music going on and on 
in your head, and you couldn't find your car keys. How would 
you feel? How would you look? What would you do? How 
would you communicate with others? How would others 
behave toward you?</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p align=left><font color="#000000"><strong>DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Imagine that ...</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Nothing seems enjoyable or fun anymore. Even your favorite 
activities, spending time with friends, listening to music, or 
going to the theatre, no longer give you any satisfaction or 
pleasure. What would it be like to be unable to enjoy yourself?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You suddenly find it difficult or impossible to remember 
anything you read. You read a page in a book, but when you set 
the book down, you can't remember what you read. How would 
you deal with your work or your studies?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You can't remember anything your boss or teacher says in 
class. You sit through class or a meeting really trying to pay 
attention, but when it is over you can't remember what was 
discussed. How would you feel about going to class or work 
every day? How would you explain your difficulties to your 
boss, teachers and parents?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You live in a black and white and gray world, because all the 
color had faded away. Someone &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on the energy 
in your body, and all but 20% of your energy drains out. You 
feel full of hot, dry sand, too tired to start even the simplest 
task. How easy would it be to do your normal activities?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Simple things you used to do automatically, like deciding what 
to wear or which radio station to listen to, take enormous 
effort. Even after deciding, you aren't sure you made the right 
decision. How would this complicate your daily routine? What 
if you had to handle major decisions like where to go to 
college or big changes like moving to another state?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You wake up every morning for weeks and can't think of one 
good reason to get up. You wish you had died in your sleep, 
and think the world would be better off without you. How much 
hope would you have for your future?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Put three or more of these situations together. This is the world 
that a person with depressive illness lives in. It is bleak and 
lifeless, without color or humor. </font></p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><strong>UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS:</strong></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">This may make it easier for you to understand how a person who is mentally ill might feel. 
They may feel this way all the time. Can you understand why they do not look real attractive 
sometimes? Why they may not comb their hair or change their clothes? Can you understand 
how they must feel?</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=3><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF TREATMENT</strong></font></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Now imagine how it would feel if you had some medication that helped you handle this. 
Here is a reason why some people with mental illnesses turn to street drugs to help them 
through the day. But imagine if you were on the right medication and these feelings and 
thoughts were much better. Wouldn't it be worthwhile to get to a doctor and give the 
medication a chance?</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Hope exists for people who have depressive illnesses and schizophrenia, because effective 
treatments are available from medical doctors and qualified mental health professionals. The 
important thing is to seek treatment from a qualified professional.</font></p>
