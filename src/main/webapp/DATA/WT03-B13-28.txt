GERMAN MINISTRIES EDGE TOWARDS AGREEMENT ON TELECOMS REGULATOR

The German economics ministry is looking increasingly likely to take
full responsibility for the new German telecommunications regulator,
after a lengthy and acrimonious battle within the country's ruling
three-party coalition.

Although a political agreement has not yet been reached, a final
decision is anticipated before next Wednesday (January 24) when the
ministry of post and telecommunications is hoping to submit to the
cabinet the draft version of its new telecommunications bill which will
pave the way for liberalisation in 1998.  The bill was supposed to be
submitted in December but has been delayed by the dispute over
regulation (Telecom Markets, 283/1).

Political negotiations are continuing in an attempt to settle the issue
by the deadline of January 24, to which the government is determined to
adhere.  Assuming that agreement can be reached on the fundamental
issue of which ministry to which the new regulator should report, the
details of the agreement can be worked out later during the legislative
process.

The first parliamentary reading of the bill is due to take place on
February 1 and the relevant parliamentary committee will begin
discussing it on February 7.  The bill is expected to be approved in
June.

The dispute has involved a cabinet battle between post and
telecommunications minister Wolfgang Botsch (who is a member of the
Christian Social Union, CSU), economics minister Gunter Rexrodt (a
member of the Free Democrat Party, FDP) and minister of technology and
education Jurgen Ruttgers (a member of the Christian Democrat Party,
CDU).

It appears that agreement has already been reached to split
responsibility for telecommunications regulation, with the economic
ministry's Federal Cartel Office taking charge of competition issues,
and another higher governmental authority taking over everything else.

It now seems likely that the economics ministry will gain control of
the new authority as well -- despite the opposition of the CSU and the
CDU.

This outcome reflects the fact that Rexrodt is continuing to wield
considerable political influence, despite the weakening position of the
FDP within the coalition.

BT, AT&T AND C&W GET SET TO FIGHT FOR THE HAND OF FININVEST

BT and AT&T have emerged as rivals to Cable & Wireless Europe in a race
to set up a strategic alliance with Fininvest, the Italian conglomerate
owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Each of the suitors is anxious to do a deal with Fininvest in order to
gain access to the national terrestrial broadcast network run by its
audiovisual subsidiary Mediaset.  This network could be used as a
springboard for opportunities in both fixed and wireless
communications.

BT is pursuing an alliance with Fininvest through Albacom, its joint
venture with leading Italian bank Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (Telecom
Markets, 267/3).  Albacom aims to secure a partnership by taking a
small equity stake in Mediaset.

It is thought that AT&T is also interested in a stake in Mediaset.

On the other hand Cable & Wireless Europe, which is equally owned by
C&W of the UK and Veba of Germany, appears to be seeking an alliance
that might not involve any equity acquisition at all.

This could put C&WE at a disadvantage, since it is thought that
Fininvest will favour potential partners that are prepared to take a
stake in Mediaset.  However, there are indications that it might bid
for a stake in Mediaset if it has to.

Fininvest says that the exact size of the Mediaset stake to be sold
will depend on the partner, although it is unlikely to be large.
Sources suggest that it will be in the region of about five per cent.
Fininvest expects to announce its telecommunications partner in the
next couple of months, and says that a separate joint venture will
probably be established for telecommunications.

Fininvest's immediate interest is value added and cellular services.
It intends to join with its new partner in applying for one of the
personal communications network (PCN) licences that the government is
expected to put out to tender later this year (Mobile Communications,
181/1).  Fininvest says that the identity of the partner will be a key
factor in determining whether or not it decides to pursue opportunities
in basic services.

Fininvest is keen to reduce its stake in Mediaset, which runs Italy's
three main national commercial television channels controlling 43 per
cent of the total audience.  Such a reduction is necessary in order to
reduce the political pressure on Berlusconi, who is hoping to return as
prime minister after the general election which is expected to be
called soon following last week's resignation of the most recent
incumbent Lamberto Dini.  Berlusconi's standing has suffered from the
general perception that there is a serious conflict of interest between
his political role and his control of so many television outlets.

Fininvest has already disposed of 24 per cent of Mediaset, but says
that it will sell another 30 per cent or so in order to take its share
down to about 45 per cent.

In October, Fininvest sold 18.5 per cent of Mediaset for around $1.1
billion to a group of three foreign partners: Saudi Prince al Waleed
ben Talal; Leo Kirch, owner of the German-based Kirch media group; and
Nethold, the European pay-TV group controlled by South African
entrepreneur Johann Rupert.  Then at the end of December Fininvest sold
a further 5.5 per cent of Mediaset for $230 million to a group of six
leading Italian banks.

After selling a stake in Mediaset to a telecommunications partner,
Fininvest plans to divest itself of another 20 per cent to 30 per cent,
partly through sales to banks and institutional investors, and partly
through a public offering.

* Berlusconi, who served an eight-month term as prime minister in 1994,
this week went on

trial facing corruption charges.  Berlusconi, his younger brother Paolo
and four other senior Fininvest executives are accused of bribing tax
officials in order to secure favourable inspections of the books of
companies in the Fininvest group.  Paolo Berlusconi and Salvatore
Sciascia, head of Fininvest's tax department, have admitted making the
payments but claim that they were blackmailed into making them.

Silvio Berlusconi is also being investigated over three other
allegations of corruption as well as for the alleged blackmail of
Antonio Di Pietro, the magistrate largely responsible for this week's
charges.

SEVEN GROUPS IN THE RUNNING FOR STAKE IN TELECOM EIREANN

The Irish government last week finally launched its long-awaited
contest for the sale of a stake of up to 35 per cent in state-owned
telecommunications carrier Telecom Eireann -- a contest which involves
seven consortia composed of nine separate companies.

The government kicked off the process on January 12 with the
publication of an information memorandum laying out the terms of the
bid.  It indicated that it hopes to choose a winner by the end of the
summer.

Michael Lowry, the minister for transport, energy and communications,
said at the launch that the government plans to invest I#220 million of
the sale proceeds in Telecom Eireann and to retain the rest itself.

The government has not said how much it expects the sale to realise
altogether.  Some local observers this week predicted figures ranging
from #400 million to #500 million.  One City banker more conservatively
estimated #350 million, having valued the whole company at #1 billion.

The government has not confirmed that it will sell the full 35 per cent
allocation in this offering (Telecom Markets, 274/21), although this is
widely understood to be its intention.  Once the full stake has been
sold, the government plans to retain a stake of between 60 per cent and
65 per cent, and to offer up to five per cent to company employees.

The seven rival bidders are:

* the grouping of BT and US carrier MCI;
* Telia of Sweden and Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN) of the
Netherlands;
* Bell Atlantic, the US regional Bell operating company;
* AirTouch, the US cellular operator;
* GTE, the US local telephone operator;
* Singapore Telecom; and
* Tele Danmark.

The first three groups are viewed as the front runners.

The BT-led group is seen as the favourite.  The involvement of MCI, in
which BT holds a 20-per-cent stake, might help to offset political
concerns over the possibility of a UK company taking a major stake in
one of Ireland's largest companies.  One observer said a US carrier
might defuse some of the political anxieties.  MCI is also a 25-per-
cent shareholder in Concert, the global corporate services joint
venture with BT.  If BT wins the bid then Telecom Eireann would become
the local distributor of Concert services.

Another strong candidate is the team of Telia and KPN, which are
already partners in the Unisource alliance.  Last month a grouping of
KPN and another Unisource member, Swiss PTT Telecom, was the runner-up
in the contest for a stake in Belgian carrier Belgacom (Telecom
Markets, 283/5).

Two of the other bidders, Singapore Telecom and Tele Danmark, could
decide to join forces, having teamed up successfully to win the
Belgacom stake ahead of the Dutch/Swiss group.

The involvement of AirTouch is surprising since, as a cellular
operator, it is hardly likely to be interested in Telecom Eireann's
fixed business.  The company is thought to have offered to buy Eircell,
Telecom Eireann's mobile division, separately from the rest of the
company.  Such a sale would be opposed by the Communications Workers
Union, which represents the majority of Telecom Eireann workers and has
some influence on the bid.  The CWU has made clear its opposition to
any deals that involve the break-up of the carrier and a consequent
weakening of its power.

Several other potential bidders which at one time had expressed
interest had already pulled out -- including Cable & Wireless (Telecom
Markets, 277/15) and AT&T (Telecom Markets, 259/3).

How to spend the money? Lowry said last week that Telecom Eireann will
use its I#220 million share of the sale proceeds to ``restructure and
strengthen'' itself in order to meet future de-regulation of the Irish
telecommunications market.  The government is to introduce full
competition on January 1, 2000 -- two years later than most European
countries.

The government wants to see a reduction in the carrier's costs and
prices. It is thought that management might offer voluntary redundancy
to about 2,000 of the carrier's 11,000-strong workforce after the sale.
 A significant rebalancing of tariffs is also likely at some point.

In addition, the carrier is also expected to draw on the expertise of
its new partner in order to invest in the introduction of the sorts of
advanced services that are already available in other countries.

In particular, the government would like to:

* improve the standard of telecommunications services offered to
multinational companies that are interested in setting up in Ireland;

* expand the household penetration rate of telephone services;

* encourage an acceleration in the rate of subscriber growth at
Eircell;

* restructure Telecom Eireann's cable television business, Cablelink,
and develop its network in order to offer broadband services and to
make its capacity available to any other interested service providers;

* provide key personnel and technical support for Telecom Eireann.

The government admits that the introduction of a strategic partner will
probably lead to redundancies at Telecom Eireann but argues that the
economic benefits generated by increasing the carrier's efficiency will
help to create new jobs in the economy as a whole.

New regulator: Lowry also announced the proposed creation of an
independent regulator to take over the regulatory functions that are
currently performed by his ministry.  The government wants to set up
the new regulator next year.

FRENCH MINISTER PROPOSES INDEPENDENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATOR

French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon outlined the basics
of the new telecommunications law on January 9 at a round table meeting
marking the end of the consultation process that was initiated on
October 13 (Telecom Markets, 279/1).

Fillon proposed the creation of an independent telecommunications
regulator along the lines of the current television regulator, the
Conseil superieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA).  The new regulator would have
responsibility for applying regulations and imposing sanctions.  The
government would retain responsibility for handing out licences and
would establish the main rules of the game.

The minister originally suggested that his ministry should retain more
of its regulatory powers (Telecom Markets, 279/1) but was swayed by the
strong support for a more independent regulatory authority that was
demonstrated during the consultation process.

The details of the split in responsibility will not become clear until
the draft legislation is presented to parliament, probably in March.
Before that stage is reached, Fillon has to present his proposals to
the prime minister for approval.  The law is due to become law by July
1.

The minister also proposed the creation of a separate agency charged
with administering the distribution of radio frequencies.

In addition, Fillon suggested that France Telecom continue to provide
universal service with new operators contributing to a fund to
subsidise this.  The universal service obligation will initially apply
only to basic telephony but this will be reviewed in five years time in
order to take into account technological progress.

New competitors will be able to obtain licences in 1997.

No details were given of how interconnection issues would be resolved.

The telecommunications minister did not give any details of the
government's plans for France Telecom itself, but did say that he would
like to see more public discussion on France Telecom's legal status.
The highly sensitive political issue of France Telecom privatisation
was one of the causes of December's public sector strikes.  Fillon said
that prime minister Alain Juppe would make a statement on the issue
before the end of January.

FRANCE TELECOM JOINS INTERNET

France Telecom will from March 15 provide access to the Internet from
anywhere in France for the price of a local call.  As well as Internet
access it will also provide its own services on the Internet through
its France Telecom Multi Media subsidiary.

At the same time, France Telecom is also proposing to cut the cost of
its Minitel on-line service and to increase the speed of the service as
well.

C&W DROPS THE FEDERATION APPROACH AS EXECUTIVE SEARCH GOES ON

Cable & Wireless this week confirmed that it has dropped its much-
criticised ``federation'' approach towards its worldwide businesses --
the issue which prompted the dispute between executive chairman Lord
Young and chief executive James Ross and led to their departures from
the company in November (Telecom Markets, 281/12).

C&W executives said at this week's extraordinary general meeting, held
on January 15, that the company will no longer use the marketing
concept of the federation, which was created in an unsuccessful attempt
to boost its stock market value.

The loss of the federation should help with investors, said one City
analyst, who said that the ``F-word'' had serious negative
connotations, given that it had been associated with a continued
underperformance of the company's share price.  But he added that this
did not entail a significant alteration in strategy, beyond a certain
change of focus.

So the company will continue with the approach which Ross had already
begun to follow in the last few months, concentrating on core
businesses in three areas: the UK and Europe; Asia-Pacific and Hong
Kong; and the USA and the Caribbean.  Tensions arose between Ross and
Young partly because the latter continued to gather a disparate
collection of additional investments alongside these core areas.

C&W is looking at how to rationalise some of these non-core interests.
According to the same analyst: ``Investors might wonder what
investments like C&W's `Baltic Hub' add to the company's value.  They
are pretty small for a company like C&W to be involved with and profits
are a long way down the line.  They are more trouble than they are
worth.''  The company holds stakes in a number of ventures in the
Baltic region including the Latvian telecommunications carrier
Lattelekom and PLD, a long-distance and international carrier in St.
Petersburg.

But the C&W strategy could soon change again, given that the company is
hoping to appoint a new chief executive in the next few months.

Monday's EGM was called in order to approve a change in the company's
articles of association in order to allow it to appoint non-UK citizens
to the positions of chief executive and executive chairman (although
any long-term appointment is likely to involve a non-executive
chairman, in order to avoid a repeat of the Young/Ross dispute).

However, the UK government, which holds a golden share in C&W, is
insisting that only one of the two posts can go to a foreigner, a
change which was agreed by the EGM.  Since the current short-term
chairman Brian Smith is a UK citizen, this leaves the way open for an
overseas appointment as chief executive.

In the short term, the change allows New Zealander Rod Olsen, C&W's
finance director, to be formally appointed as acting chief executive (a
task he was already carrying out -- Telecom Markets, 283/15).  In the
longer term, the company is thought to be looking to recruit a
permanent chief from the US telecommunications or computer industries.

One name that has been raised is that of Richard Callahan, former
president of the international operations of US regional carrier US
West.  Analysts are more sceptical about suggestions that the company
might seek to recall Duncan Lewis, who resigned as chief executive of
C&W subsidiary Mercury Communications in September (Telecom Markets,
276/1).

There has been some surprise at the absence of any internal candidates
-- particularly Olsen, who until last November's double departure had
been tipped as the most likely successor to Ross, but will now be a
member of the appointments committee, and Linus Cheung, the chief
executive of Hongkong Telecom, the most successful business in the C&W
group, who many thought would have a chance of the top job.

C&W says that both men have issued statements saying that they do not
wish to be considered for the job -- a development that many
commentators have found puzzling.

AT&T SIGNS COLT DEAL AND GEARS UP FOR UK ROLL-OUT IN 1996

The deal that AT&T signed this week for interconnection with City of
London Telecommunications (Colt) is the first of a number of
initiatives that the US carrier is planning this year to increase its
presence in the UK market.

The deal, which will enable AT&T to enhance its coverage in London,
will be followed by a publicity event in the capital next Tuesday
(January 23) which is intended to raise the profile of its Software
Defined Network (SDN) product -- the virtual private network service
which was launched last autumn.

AT&T is likely to use the event, which will be attended by chairman
Robert Allen, to lay out its plans for new services to be launched in
the UK during 1996.

In addition to the already offered data and VPN services (Telecom
Markets, 277/8), AT&T will explain the launch dates for its 0800
freephone, UK long-distance and international simple resale (ISR)-based
international telephone services.

But the carrier's UK strategy has so far appeared rather relaxed.  Both
its long-distance and its ISR services were originally due to have
launched in the third quarter of last year (Telecom Markets, 277/8).
In addition, the company chose last month not to bid for the radio
frequencies offered by the Department of Trade and Industry for
wireless local loop services (Telecom Markets, 283/5).  Nor was it
among the bidders for the sale of long-distance carrier British Rail
Telecommunications (Telecom Markets, 280/1).  It has also previously
pulled out of negotiations to buy UK carriers Mercury Communications
and Energis (Telecom Markets, 242/1).

The interconnection between AT&T and Colt's two networks will enable
the former to gain access to Colt's London network.  In return, AT&T
will carry Colt's traffic on its ISR-based service, mainly to the USA.
When its long-distance service is available, AT&T might also carry some
of Colt's UK traffic.

The agreement between the two carriers is non-exclusive.  It is only

C&W OFFERS LESS TO YOUNG

The board of C&W appears set to offer Lord Young rather less than he
wanted in terms of severance pay.  Young is thought to have been
looking for somewhere between #2.5 million and #4 million.  But C&W is
understood to have offered less than a year's salary plus his pension
entitlements, worth a total of less than #1 million.

OFTEL MAKES FURTHER DELAY ON STANDARD INTERCONNECTION CHARGES

The Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) is likely to put off until
next month its long-awaited determination on interim standard
interconnection charges for 1995-96, which could offer savings of 35
per cent over existing rates.

Oftel had hoped to issue the determination this month.  But it has had
to hold back because it is still calculating whether certain costs
should be excluded from the charges paid by other carriers for using
BT's network.

The regulator said before Christmas that it would have to gather more
information on the costs incurred on such elements as BT redundancies,
the running of chairman Sir Iain Vallance's office and the company's
advertising campaigns (Telecom Markets, 283/14) which BT said should be
paid for by other carriers via its interconnection charges.

These costs account for 15 per cent of the total cost of
interconnection, in addition to the 20-per-cent reduction predicted by
Don Cruickshank, director general of telecommunications in October
(Telecom Markets, 279/1), when the charges were originally to have been
issued (Telecom Markets, 277/1).

``Oftel has to be very careful on this,'' said one observer, although
the regulator is still thought keen to reduce the charges by a further
15 per cent to give a 35-per-cent reduction in total.

SERVICE PROVIDERS

Oftel's consultation document on the role of service providers is
likely to attract opposition from telecommunications network carriers
when it is published in the next few weeks.

Carriers fear that the document will seek, in line with European Union
proposals, to establish the principle of equal access for service
providers, such as resellers and value-added service suppliers.

Service providers would then be entitled to cost-based interconnection
rates rather than the retail rates that are currently charged for using
a carrier's network.  Such a change in their regulatory status would
make them much more competitive as well as reducing the revenue
received by carriers.  ``It's a contentious issue,'' said one carrier.

Oftel complained in July after publication of its policy document,
Effective Competition: Framework for Action (Telecom Markets, 274/15),
that few service providers had bothered to respond.  But a number,
including the UK Internet access provider Pipex, have since become more
vocal.

The service provider document was originally to have been published in
December (Telecom Markets, 282/1) but the welter of other proposals led
to a postponement.

OFTEL'S FAIR TRADING PROPOSALS

The regulator last month published for consultation its controversial
proposed licence amendment on anti-competitive practice (Telecom
Markets, 283/14).  BT immediately expressed ``disappointment'' that
Oftel was determined to adopt what it called ``sweeping new powers''.

BT has until March, when the consultation period is due to end, to
decide whether to accept the licence amendment.  If it does not, Oftel
will refer the issue to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

MERCURY'S RULES RELAXED

Oftel last month proposed to remove a number of conditions from
Mercury's operating licence in order to put it in a stronger position
to compete against BT and smaller rivals in the UK telecommuni-cations
market.  In particular, Mercury will no longer have to publish tariffs
28 days in advance of when they become effective.  Instead, it will
have to publish the tariffs on the same day as their commercial launch,
although other telecommunications carriers, such as Colt or MFS, do not
have to publish their tariffs at all.

However, Cruickshank said that Mercury should still be defined as a
dominant carrier in the international-calls market where it has a
considerable market share.

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IN RETHINK ON NTT BREAK-UP

Newly-elected Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his three-
party coalition government appear to be coming round to the view that
national carrier Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) should not be
broken up, favouring instead a broader policy of deregulation that does
not focus solely of restructuring NTT.

Other influential organisations within Japan also seem less certain
about whether a radical restructuring of NTT represents the best way
forward.  The Keidanren, the federation of Japanese business interests,
published a report on the future of NTT on January 9, but was unable to
give a definitive answer because opinion was split down the middle.

These developments come shortly before the appearance of the long-
awaited report on NTT by the Telecommunications Council, an advisory
panel of high-level industrialists and civil servants.  The Council was
set up last April and given until the end of next month to draw up
plans for the future structure and management of NTT (Telecom Markets,
268/1).

The report will be sent to the ministry of post and telecommunications
(MPT), a long-standing champion of a break-up which shows no sign of
changing its mind.  The MPT is due to present its proposals on NTT to
the Japanese Parliament at the end of March.

Increasing competition: The arguments in favour of breaking up NTT are
largely focused on competitive issues.  NTT dominates local services
with a 98 per cent market share, according to the Institute for
Japanese-European Technology Studies at the University of Edinburgh.
It is argued that reorganising NTT's local service business into a
number of regional operating companies would encourage new entrants to
the market.  It is thought that it would be easier for new entrants to
compete against regional NTT units than against a single, monolithic
NTT.

It is also argued, by the powerful ministry of international trade and
industry (Miti) among others, that if NTT is allowed to continue to
dominate the market for local services, the development of multimedia
and interactive services could be stifled.

Dr Martin Fransman, director of the Institute for Japanese-European
Technology Studies, believes that there are broader issues at stake and
that break-up NTT will not in itself create more competition.  In a
recent report, NTT and Japan's telecommunications industry at the
crossroads, Fransman argues that one of the most important factors
effecting future competition in Japan will be the ease and cost at
which new entrants will be able to interconnect with NTT's network.

Fransman says that breaking up NTT or any other such measure will make
little difference unless actual access charges are transparent and
based on real costs.  If this is not the case, new entrants will not be
able to calculate the returns they can expect, and so providers of
capital might be reluctant to invest.  In addition, the government
needs to put in place clear and explicit procedures for negotiating
interconnection agreements, as well as a neutral body to settle any
disputes that might arise.

NTT appears to be making concessions, and in October indicated that it
was prepared to give full and equal access to its local network
(Telecom Markets, 278/15).  However, the move received a lukewarm
reception from analysts as NTT gave no indication as to how it would
implement the new regime.  Critics suggested that the real reason for
the announcement was the company's desire to ease the pressure for its
break-up.

Fransman also favours a break-down of the strict demarcation between
international and domestic long-distance services.  NTT is currently
banned from offering international services, which are the preserve of
Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), International Digital Communications (IDC)
and International Telecom Japan (ITJ).  In turn, the three
international operators are banned from offering domestic long-distance
services.  These are reserved for NTT, DDI, Teleway Japan and Japan
Telecom -- although NTT has by far the largest market share with about
60 per cent.

Fransman notes that NTT is one of the few national carriers not allowed
to offer international services.  As a result, Japan is one of the few
countries that does not have a genuine contender in the international
telecommunications market, given that KDD, IDC and ITJ are all
relatively small in international terms.  Fransman argues that NTT is
the only carrier in Japan with the size and resources necessary to
become a significant player.  But he concedes that given the time it
takes to establish such a position NTT might find itself too far behind
established players to make much impact.

Hashimoto was finance minister between 1989 and 1991.  The finance
ministry holds the government's 65-per-cent stake in NTT.  As a result
it is one of the strongest opponents of a break-up, other than NTT
itself.  Opponents of a break-up argue that this step would result in a
loss of existing economies of scale, and a weakening of research and
development efforts which are said to be crucial for the development of
multimedia services (Telecom Markets, 262/4).  In addition, if NTT is
split into a number of regional companies, it will be that much harder
to induce them to work together to build a national optical-fibre
information superhighway.

Sceptics note that profits from NTT feed into the national budget, and
that the finance ministry is probably reluctant to jeopardise a
valuable revenue stream by splitting up the company.

The MPT position: The MPT will, in drawing up its own proposals,
consider not only the recommendations from the Telecommunications
Council, but also the report produced last year by the Administrative
Reform Commission, part of the prime minister's office.  This report
outlines the most radical blueprint for restructuring NTT (Telecom
Markets, 276/6).

The commission recommends that NTT's local service business should be
divided into four regional operating companies covering separate areas,
and that these companies should be allowed to offer cable television
services (which NTT is currently unable to do).  The commission also
recommends that NTT's domestic long-distance business is spun-off into
a separate company, which would for the first time be allowed to offer
international services.  The three international carriers would in turn
be allowed to domestic long-distance market.

However, it is unclear whether the MPT will propose such radical
measures.  Some analysts believe a more acceptable compromise could be
adopted whereby NTT is simply split into two companies: one for long-
distance services and another for local services.

PARTNERS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO PHOENIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALLIANCE

US long-distance carrier Sprint said last week that it would complete
its Phoenix alliance with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by the
end of this month, and that it expects to launch services in the first
half of this year.

The deal involves Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom jointly taking a
20-per-cent-stake in Sprint, split equally between them, at a total
cost of between $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion.

The final price will be influenced by the valuation given to Sprint
Cellular, which is to be spun off from the rest of Sprint in the first
half of this year.  The Deutsche Telekom/France Telecom stake will be
in the new non-cellular core of Sprint.

A special meeting of Sprint shareholders will be held on January 29 to
vote on proposals relating to the investment as well as on the spin-off
of the cellular arm.

Under the terms of the investment agreement, Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom will acquire the shares at the price of $48.704 per
share.

The moves follow last month's decisions by the US Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and Department of Justice to grant
their approval to Phoenix (Telecom Markets, 283/16).

The joint venture had already received preliminary approval from the
European Commission last October (Telecom Markets, 279/6).  The EC is
unlikely to grant final approval to Phoenix -- and to Atlas, the
European arm of the joint venture -- until the second quarter of this
year.  But competition commissioner Karel Van Miert has indicated that
the EC would not challenge any move to launch services before final
approval has been given.

WEST EUROPEAN SERVICES MARKET SET TO REACH $212 BILLION IN 2000

The value of the West European market for telecommunications services
will increase from $160 billion in 1995 to $212 billion in 2000
according to a new report, New Opportunities in European Telecommuni-
cations, produced by UK consultancy Ovum.

The report says that the bulk of the $50 billion increase in the
service market -- defined as the revenues generated by both fixed and
mobile networks -- will be generated by growth in the mobile market.  It
predicts that the value of the fixed market will increase by 1.76 per
cent from $141.5 billion in 1995 to $154.4 billion in 2000, but that
the size of the mobile market will rise by 25 per cent from $18.9
billion to $56.8 billion in 2000.

According to the report -- which covers the 15 countries of the European
Union, plus Norway and Switzerland -- the best fixed-network
opportunities will arise in Austria, France and Germany.  These
countries all have large markets, incumbent operators that are
vulnerable to some degree and the likelihood of pro-competitive
regulatory regimes.  The report excludes Italy from this group on the
grounds that its regulatory framework is likely to be rather less
favourable to competition.

The countries with the lowest level of fixed-network opportunity,
partly because of the existing degree of exploitation, are Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden.  The report says that in these countries
the penetration of fixed telephony is already high and cannot increase
much further.  Fixed-network revenues are expected to decline due to
the increasing degree of substitution by mobile-network services.  In
addition, these countries have small markets and efficient incumbent
operators which already charge low prices.

The report also believes that:

* The best opportunities in the long-distance market will be in
Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

* The best opportunities in the local-loop market will be in the UK and
Ireland.  Tariff rebalancing and the availability of other
infrastructures such as cable television networks are key factors in
making the local market more attractive to new entrants.

* The best opportunities for the resale of capacity will be in France,
Germany, Greece, and Ireland.  The best opportunities for resellers are
in countries with low leased-line prices and high trunk prices.

* The best opportunities for mobile operators will be in Belgium and
Switzerland, both of which have underdeveloped mobile markets.

The report argues that the chances for the success of a new
telecommunications venture will be affected by a number of factors
including the regulatory environment, the strength of the incumbent
operator and the size and expected growth rate of each market.  It says
that the regulatory environment will be a key determinant of the ease
of entry for new competitors.

Given that the EU is leaving it up to individual countries to interpret
rules on such issues as interconnection charges, significant regulatory
differences can be expected to arise.  Even if the EU were to choose to
enforce its requirements it would take around three years to complete
the process -- one year to discuss an infringement with a member state
and to notify it of proceedings, and then two years to pursue the
matter through the courts.  The independence of the national regulator
and the extent of its experience will be crucial factors in determining
the opportunities available in a particular market.

DEUTSCHE BAHN SHORTLIST

Deutsche Bahn, the German federal railway operator, last week selected
the shortlist for the 49-per-cent stake it is offering in new
subsidiary DBKom,

narrowing down the number of bids to either three or four.

The remaining bidders are thought to include: Communications Network
International (CNI) and AT&T; Thyssen and BellSouth; Viag; and RWE.

Communications Network International (CNI) is a joint venture between
Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank which also has a cooperation deal with the
Uniworld alliance between AT&T and Unisource (Telecom Markets, 276/2).

German steel-based conglomerate Thyssen and US regional
telecommunications operator BellSouth established a joint venture in
February 1995 with a view to obtaining a full operating licence after
liberalisation (Telecom Markets, 262/15).

Viag is believed to be bidding along with Thyssen and BellSouth for a
stake in DBKom and to be considering possibly extending the
relationship.

However, Viag's name has also been linked with RWE -- there are reports
that RWE may be considering joining the InterKom alliance between
energy utility Viag and BT.  RWE has been looking for new partners
following its withdrawal from the CNI joint venture with Mannesmann and
Deutsche Bank last September and its failure to strike a deal with AT&T
(Telecom Markets, 276/2).

Vebacom, the telecommunications subsidiary of industrial conglomerate
Veba, did not make it to the shortlist.  Vebacom is particularly
disappointed as it already has an access agreement to unused capacity
on the Deutsche Bahn network (Telecom Markets, 283/2), and was bidding
for a stake in Deutsche Bahn in the hope of deepening this
relationship.

However, Vebacom this week (January 16) signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with Mannesmann Eurokom, the telecommunications
division of Mannesmann, to form a 50:50 joint venture company.  This
company, headquartered in Hanover, is intended to establish a national
telecommuni-cations network to carry public switched telephony from
1998 as well as other telecommunications services, cable television and
broadband services.  This might give Vebacom a second chance at
obtaining a stake in DBKom.

The number of potential telecommunications alliances in Germany seems
to be growing by the day, but many are unlikely to come to fruition,
according to Malcolm Ross of consultants Arthur D Little.  ``Many of
these will be dirty weekends rather than marriages,'' he says.
``Whether many will result in children is doubtful''.

Second phase bids are expected to be submitted for evaluation around
April and a final decision is expected by the end of the second quarter
of this year.

ROW OVER DEUTSCHE TELEKOM RATES

Deutsche Telekom's new rate structure, announced on New Year's Day, has
been criticised by numerous politicians including post and
telecommunications minister Wolfgang Botsch.

The increases in local call rates and decreases in long-distance rates,
which form part of an ongoing process of tariff rebalancing, have been
extremely badly received.

Deutsche Telekom is being urged to introduce a rebate system modelled
on existing `friends and family' systems as soon as possible, in order
to take the edge off the rate increases.  Deutsche Telekom claims that
this will not be possible until the end of the year at the earliest,
because not enough telephone lines are yet digitalised.

The political temperature was also raised by a computer error on New
Year's Day which resulted in residential customers being charged
weekday rates instead of a lower holiday tariff for domestic long-
distance calls.  Deutsche Telekom has run a big advertising campaign
apologising for the billing mistake and has announced that it will
offer households 30 free units as compensation.  Deutsche Telekom also
intends to offer cheaper rates than normal on the last Sunday in
February.

The January 29 meeting of the telecommuni-cations regulatory council is
expected to consider the above issues and possibly exert extra pressure
on Deutsche Telekom.

NYNEX RESTRUCTURE IN BID TO SHAKE `LEAST-EFFICIENT' TAG

The restructuring plan unveiled last week by Nynex CableComms, which
involves the shedding of 11 per cent of the 2,900-strong workforce,
follows months of criticism from City analysts that the company is the
least efficient of the UK's cable operators.

Nynex hopes that the cutting of 310 jobs and a saving of between #7
million and #10 million a year will enable it to reach operating
cashflow breakeven by the end of this year.

But the company's financial problems were underlined this week by the
publication of its operating statistics for 1995, which showed total
revenues for the year of #85 million -- up from the 1994 figure of #41
million, but still #23 million short of some analysts expectations.

The restructuring involves the centralisation of much management, a
move which gained a mixed reception from analysts.

The company said that more than 70 per cent of the job cuts -- which
will be effected through a mixture of sackings, voluntary redundancies
and natural wastage -- resulted from a #25 million investment in
information-technology systems to handle areas such as subscriber
management and tele-sales.

The axe is falling most heavily in the sales and marketing areas,
reflecting a move away from door-to-door sales towards tele-sales, an
approach which Nynex regards as more efficient (it accounted for a
quarter of sales in 1995).

Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who has
just taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his old
role of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, who
drew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officer
Nicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New York
office to undertake a similar role.  There was only one senior
casualty: Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block of
franchises.

Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industry
analysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UK
operators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs through
economies of scale.

The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing and
administration represented 132 per cent of its revenues for the nine
months to end-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 per
cent for TeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.

The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 by
the end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 too
many.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on an
expected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get the
television customers we expected, but the whole industry expected
more.''

In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UK
cable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- the
proportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in the
industry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on the
basis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be the
best, but it is close to it.  At 30 per cent, it contrasts strongly
with TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.

On the other hand, Nynex's operating statistics for 1995 show that
penetration (the number of subscribers expressed as a percentage of
those who could take the service because the cable passes their homes)
is running at 19.8 per cent -- lower than the latest TeleWest figure of
21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8 per cent.  Nynex knows
that it must increase its sales, but suggests that the churn rather
than the penetration figures may turn out to be the biggest contributor
to long-term success.

Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.
Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churn
lower.  Indeed, it has recently increased its spending.  According to
Mearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in terms
of customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we need
to make it more economic.''

Nynex hopes by the end of this year to reduce the cost of sales,
marketing and administration to 50 per cent of its revenue-base -- the
level it expects TeleWest to achieve.

Nynex's restructuring could be seen as part of a wider trend within the
industry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a general panic,
but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television is still not
selling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a small restructuring
in its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.

The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate culture
resulting from the UK company turning itself last June from a wholly-
owned foreign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephone
company into a public company (though major policy decisions still have
to go through the slow process of gaining US approval).

The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuring
represented the opening shots of a new management style.  It said that
it was purely a coincidence that the moves were announced during the
week of Connell's departure.

As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up in
the wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &
Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,
before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turn
of the year.

Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-up
behaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel good
about it.''

Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,
Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a good
thing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to put
management resources as close to the franchises being managed as
possible.''

Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even with
the changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end of
the year.

Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves.  Nynex was, after all,
only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.
However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement
(January 8), closing at 105p.  It fell further this week to reach an
all-time low of 95p on Monday before recovering to 97p on Wednesday
afternoon after the 1995 figures were released.

INTERNET SERVICES TO BE WORTH #12 BILLION BY 2002, SAYS REPORT

There will be more than 200 million worldwide users of the Internet by
the end of 2002, according to a new report from London stockbroker
Durlacher.  These users will be accessing services via more than 150
million subscriptions, and generating annual revenues of more than #12
billion.

There were estimated to be about 33.4 million Internet users worldwide
at the end of 1995, on 15.3 million subscriptions.

The report differentiates between two main methods of connection: 1)
connection via dedicated Internet service providers (ISPs); and 2)
connection via full online bulletin board services (BBS) -- an
environment where the service provider brings together a finite
collection of information and services.

The report predicts that the number of subscribers to BBS services will
grow from about 13 million at the end of 1995 to over 84 million at the
end of 2002.  The annual revenues generated by these subscribes will
increase from about #667 million to more than #8 billion.

The number of subscribers to dedicated ISPs, on the other hand, will
grow from around 1.7 million at the end of 1995 to over 70 million by
the end of 2002.  The annual revenues will increase from around #127
million to over #4 billion.

The report thus predicts that there will be 154 million online
subscriptions by 2002. It anticipates a duplication factor of 25 per
cent, so that approximately 38 million subscribers will have more than
one account.  This means that there will be 116 million separate
subscribers in 2002.

The value of the UK market alone will grow from #35 million in 1995 to
more than #900 million by the turn of the century.

LOOT CHALLENGES BT

The London advertising daily, Loot, says it is seeking ``tens of
thousands of pounds'' compensation from BT for a fault on its lines
which prevented potential advertisers from getting through to the
publication for 11 hours.  BT says that Loot has no grounds for
compensation, since engineers had been on site within the time
specified in the paper's maintenance contract.  BT also disagrees with
Loot's claim that the lines went down because engineers cut through an
optical-fibre cable, saying that the break-down was due to faulty
software.
