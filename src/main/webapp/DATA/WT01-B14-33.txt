<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 2, 1996</I>

<P>
As domestic final sales grew at a 4.5% annual rate during the first quarter and 4.8% during the second quarter, the optimists are far more likely to be right than the pessimists.  The economy does not suddenly fade when final demand is resilient and there are no major policy shocks to depress confidence.  The August purchasing agent survey confirmed that the July pause in output was temporary and there is no reason for output growth to slow during September unless there is a strike in the auto industry.  As a result, the odds are high that U.S. forecasters will soon revise up their fourth quarter forecasts to the 2.5-3.5% range from the current range of 1.5-2.2%.  Such revisions will then set the stage for Fed tightening of at least 25 basis points by late September.  If the August employment report shows robust gains in job creation, the Fed could tighten even sooner but such a dramatic gesture will probably require the unemployment rate to drop to 5.2% or less.

The minutes of the early July FOMC meeting depicted the divergences which exist both in the Fed and private sector forecasting community very accurately.  The majority believed that ...

" The most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation.  Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation.  While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures.    However, inflation had remained relatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other factors was expected to curb demand.  Moreover, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment.  The current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accommodative.  While the federal funds rate had been reduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current level on an inflation-adjusted basis seems to be only marginally below its peak prior to mid-1995.  In the circumstances, the Committee could afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional inflation pressures were like to develop"

The dissidents from the majority view warned that continued strong output growth would undermine the Fed's inflation targets.  The minutes noted,

"A differing view gave more emphasis to prospects for rising inflation and the need for immediate action to forestall a buildup of cost and price pressures before they undermined the expansion.  There was little firm evidence that economic growth was slowing and reports of appreciable wage pressures were increasing.  Inflation expectations persisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor markets as well; if they were allowed to worsen the Committee's long-run goal of price stability would become much more difficult to achieve.  Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in policy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy"

The committee decided to approve only a change in their policy bias, not an actual interest rate hike, because of the psychological impact of raising interest rates.  The minutes said "Some noted that a policy tightening action would tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening". 
<P>
At the FOMC meeting in late September, the Fed will probably have new evidence of the economy expanding at a rate close to 3.0% but few signs of accelerating inflation at the retail level.  The factors which will force the Fed to hike interest rates will be concern about the intermediate term inflation consequence of the unemployment rate dropping close to 5.0% and large increases in long-term bond yields.  The fact that the two dissenting votes on monetary policy during the past nine months have come from district presidents in the middle west (Minneapolis, Kansas City) also suggests that the district presidents could play a more important role than usual in the conduct of monetary policy this autumn.  As a result of their location in strong growth regions such as the middle west, the rocky mountain states and California, they are more aware of how low unemployment and aggressive bank lending practices are affecting business behavior than the Washington based governors who depend upon government statistical reports and staff forecasts which often lag behind developments in the private sector.  The fact that the Fed's own staff has greatly underestimated the economy's growth rate this year will probably also increase the determination of the district presidents to become more vociferous about the potential inflation risks of the economy expanding at an above trend growth rate for another year.
