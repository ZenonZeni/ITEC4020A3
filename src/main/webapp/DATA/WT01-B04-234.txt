<P>According to Robert E. Prince, GTS Duratek president and CEO, "So far this year, the Company has achieved a number of very important milestones.  Most recently, we commenced commercial operations, processing radioactive waste, in our full-scale facility located at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site.  In another major victory, GTS Duratek and its teammates were awarded a contract for phase I of the Hanford Tank Clean-up which will be the DOE's largest radioactive waste clean-up project."

<P>Robert F. Shawver, GTS Duratek executive vice president and CFO added, "Commencing operations at our vitrification facility, located on the DOE's 300-square-mile Savannah River Site, is a very key step that we believe uniquely positions this facility to generate ongoing revenue streams for the Company."

<P>GTS Duratek is an environmental technology and services firm that uses its proprietary vitrification processes to convert radioactive and hazardous waste into glass for long-term storage and disposal.
