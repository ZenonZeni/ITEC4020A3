<P>
The CRC for Vaccine Technology was established in July 1993. It brings together six partners who seek to develop generic technologies for the design of future vaccines, to help industry apply these strategies to specific medical and veterinary vaccines and to provide training to strengthen Australia's vaccine industry. The centre is based in Queensland with a partner in Sydney and four partners in Melbourne.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The CRC undertakes five research programs:
<UL>
<LI>Identification of the critical proteins of antigens and methods for folding proteins to induce protective immune responses.
<LI>Induction of cytotoxic or killer T cells to protect against viruses and tumours.
<LI>Induction of the correct type of immune response such that appropriate effector mechanisms are activated to combat an infection.
<LI>Construction of multi-meric vaccines that have the ability to protect against multi-strains of a particular pathogen or multi-pathogens.
<LI>Development of an effective vaccine against influenza that induces both antibody and cellular immune responses.
</UL>
As well as these programs, a number of taskforces exist to focus on particular vaccines as opposed to generic technology.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
The CRC is currently involved in clinical trials of two vaccines for Epstein Barr virus and malaria. If the EBV trials are successful the technology could be applied to many vaccines. Studies from the malaria trials were reported at the International Congress of Immunology in San Francisco of 1995. Both these trials test generic technology.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
One of the centre's major aims is to maximise the efficacy of vaccines of interest to commercial partners - such as streptococci, Epstein Barr virus, malaria, influenza, cattle ticks, babesia, gastrointestinal nematodes and veterinary hormones. The major advantage of the veterinary vaccines is that they replace chemicals and biologically active substances currently in use to control these diseases.
There is increasing public concern over the use of chemicals due to residues in the environment and in the food. In addition, many parasites have developed resistance to these chemicals, requiring new and more potent products to be developed. Vaccination could replace all of these. The potential market for vaccines exceeds the current market for chemicals which is worth several billion dollars per year.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Four of the six partners are based in Australia’s medical biotechnology centre known as the "The Parkville Strip".
<P>
<H3>Training</H3>
The centre runs seminar programs, staff members lecture at universities and postgraduate students work on research projects supported by the centre.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
Local vaccine manufacturers will be able to draw on CRC know-how to design and produce vaccines which significantly improve health and productivity. This may lead to new vaccines in the long term and improvements to existing vaccines within the first seven years of the CRC.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The centre operates on a $5.5 million annual budget of which $2 million is provided by the Australian Government. The commercial partners between them provide $0.9 million annually, while the research organisations provide a total of $2.6 million.
