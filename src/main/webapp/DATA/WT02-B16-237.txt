<h2>Polycrystalline Thin Films</h2>
<p><strong>The Materials</strong>

<p>Copper indium diselenide (CuInSe<sub>2</sub>) has an extremely high absorptivity that allows 99% of the
available light to be absorbed in the first micron of the material. The most common
material for the window layer in CuInSe<sub>2</sub> devices is cadmium sulfide (CdS), although
sometimes zinc is added to improve the transparency. Adding small amounts of gallium to the
absorbing CuInSe<sub>2</sub> layer boosts its <a href="bandgaps.html">band gap</a> 
(from its normal 1.0 eV), which improves the voltage and therefore the 
<a href="conveff.html">efficiency</a> of the device.

<p>Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is another prominent polycrystalline thin-film material.  With a
nearly ideal band gap of 1.44 eV, CdTe also has a very high absorptivity.  Although CdTe is
most often used in PV devices without being alloyed, it is easily alloyed with zinc, mercury, and
some other elements to vary its properties.  Like CuInSe<sub>2</sub>, CdTe films can be manufactured
using low-cost techniques.

Photovoltaic Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT) project. (Photo: Solar Cells, Inc.)</font>

<p>Like CuInSe<sub>2</sub>, the best CdTe cells employ a heterojunction interface, with cadmium sulfide
(CdS) acting as a thin window layer.  Tin oxide is used as a <a href="econtacts2.html">transparent 
conducting oxide</a> and
antireflection coating. One problem with CdTe is that p-type CdTe films tend to be highly
resistive electrically, which leads to large internal losses. A solution is to allow the CdTe layer to
be intrinsic (natural, neither <a href="ptype.html">p-type nor n-type</a>), and adding a layer of p-type zinc telluride
(ZnTe) between the CdTe and the back electrical contact.  Even though the n-type CdS and the
p-type ZnTe are separated, they still form an electrical field that extends right through the
intrinsic CdTe.  

<p><img border=0 align=left hspace=15 vspace=3 src="images/0633341.gif">
<p><font color="#F79D00">One way around contacting problems inherent in typical CdTe
cells is to use an n-i-p structure, with an intrinsic layer of CdTe sandwiched between an n-type
CdS layer and a p-type ZnTe layer.</font>
