<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">April 27, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>NORML</b> REITERATES ITS
COMMITMENT TO NON-VIOLENCE</font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following the tragedy in Oklahoma City, it has
been suggested that groups that are critical of government
policies are somehow encouraging violence.&nbsp; Since its
inception, NORML has had a commitment to non-violence in the
tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp; NORML's principal
message is that marijuana prohibition is unjustified violence
against peaceful marijuana users.&nbsp; There have been almost
ten million marijuana arrests since 1965.&nbsp; Each of these
involves coercion and the threat of state violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML
said, &quot;Our message to the government, like that of the
'velvet revolution' that peacefully overthrew Communism in
Czechoslovakia, is that they need not fear us because we are not
like them.&nbsp; We want to end violence, not spread it.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML does not see the proposed anti-terrorist
legislation as a significant new threat to marijuana users, who
have almost no Constitutional rights remaining.&nbsp; It is the
narcocracy, not some &quot;new world order,&quot; that is the
real and present danger to our liberty.&nbsp; For sometime NORML
has been trying to get the media interested in the role of the
National Guard in domestic law enforcement, but to no
avail.&nbsp; As one witty observer complained, &quot;Why is it
that Americans are paranoid about the wrong things?&quot;&nbsp;
The problem with paranoia is that when you are fighting imaginary
devils you cannot see the very real evils.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Affirmative Medical Necessity Defense Bill
Being Considered In California</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sacramento, CA, On Tuesday, <b>May 2nd</b>, the
Assembly Committee on Public Safety will be voting on proposed

<p align="center"><b>NIDA To Hold A National Conference On
Marijuana</b></p>

Treatment, and Research</u> on <b>July 19 &amp; 20</b>,

<p align="center"><b>Major Increase In British Teens Using
Cannabis</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 24,</b> <i>Reuters</i> reports that,
&quot;The number of 15 and 16-year-old British boys who have smoked
cannabis has tripled in the past three years and one third now
say they have used the <u>illegal</u> drug.&quot;&nbsp; [these
figures are the result of a recent poll conducted by Exeter
University for the BBC -ed.]&nbsp; The survey found that 32.9
percent of boys aged 15 and 16 and 27.3 percent of girls admitted
having smoked cannabis in 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This is compared to 11.3 percent of boys and 8.9 percent of girls
in 1991, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>

<p align="center"><b>(</b><b><i>Conveniently</i></b><b>) The BBC
Airs A Rabid Anti-Marijuana &quot;Documentary&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 24,</b> London, UK, The traditionally
respected, high profile documentary program Panorama presented
some of the most extreme anti-cannabis propaganda that the UK
public has ever seen.&nbsp; The majority of the of the program
was filmed in the USA focused on four main health risks
associated with the use of cannabis, namely: addiction, birth
problems, mental deterioration and cancer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Various parts of the program were split up with excerpts of
groups of teenage age school children suggesting that cannabis:
&quot;isn't all that bad;&quot; &quot;it's just a bit of
fun;&quot; and &quot;it could be bad if you smoke it with
tobacco&quot; as the <i><u>only</u></i> defense against several
professors who were damning cannabis to hell. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Legalize Cannabis Campaign (LCC) is strongly contesting the
content and obvious bias of the program.&nbsp; It appears that
this program has greatly raised the stakes in the UK's ongoing
public debate about <i>how</i> or if the cannabis laws need to be
modified. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For further information on the BBC program <i>Panorama</i>:
&quot;High Risk&quot; or on the Legalize Cannabis Campaign,
please contact David Colbourne or Rob Christopher, BM Box 2455, London

<p align="center"><b>Surprising Police Views Of The &quot;Drug
War&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 9,</b> A <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>
editorial reported on a survey of nearly 500 police chiefs, police
officers, district attorneys, public defenders, judges, and
Stanford students, which examined their attitudes toward
&quot;drug warring&quot;. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The survey was conducted by Hoover Institute research fellow
Joseph D. McNamara, former police chief of San Jose.&nbsp; The <i>Examiner</i>
editorial reports that the survey &quot;found that 95 percent of the
police officers believed the U.S. was losing the war on drugs and
98 percent thought drug abuse was not primarily a police
problem.&nbsp; Just over 90 percent of the cops said increased prevention
and treatment could control drugs more effectively.&nbsp; More
than 30 percent of the cops said that legalization or
decriminalization would lead to or cause a decrease in drug use
or else not affect it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A majority of all those surveyed said the answer was not more
military intervention, prisons, police or prosecutors.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For a copy of the Hoover Institute's survey of law enforcement
officials, please contact research fellow Joseph McNamara, Hoover
Institute, Stanford, CA 94305-6011.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Jimmy Montgomery: The Importance Of
Publicity</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 27,</b> In the past week, due in part to
publicity being monopolized by the terrible bombing in Oklahoma,
prison officials have resumed neglecting treatment of Jim
Montgomery.&nbsp; In the entire time he has been in prison, he
has not had a fresh change of clothing.&nbsp; He's still in the
clothes that he wore when he entered the prison---<u>nearly three
weeks ago</u>.&nbsp; He has also been denied the ability to shower. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Worst of all, he has been put back on oral anti-biotics rather
than injected anti-biotics (which greatly upsets Jimmy's
digestive track and is not effective in treating the chronic
infections of his lower body). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[To help secure Jimmy Montgomery's release from this cruel
imprisonment, please contact the Governor of Oklahoma, Frank
Keating, (405) 521-2342.&nbsp; OK NORML can be reached by contacting
Michael Pearson, (405) 840-HEMP.]</p>
