<CENTER><H3><B>FY97 LABOR, HHS, EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL<BR> PASSES COMMITTEE
</CENTER></H3></B> <P>


The House Appropriations Committee adopted the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill for FY 1997 on Tuesday, June 25.  The bill passed along party lines, 27-17.  Overall, the bill is $400 million below the FY '96 enacted level for discretionary education programs.  No changes were made to education funding levels during the committee markup.<P>

If you'll recall, the House Subcommittee mostly level-funded programs (kept the same funding level as in FY 1996)  under IDEA, with one exception: adding $900,000 to the Media and Captioning Services program. The full Committee agreed to those same funding levels.  <P>

The bill is expected to go to the House floor after the July 4th recess.  The Senate Labor, HHS, Education appropriations subcommittee is expected to act after July 16.<P>

We'll keep you updated!!!<P>
