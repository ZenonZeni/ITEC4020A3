<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
The Remote Sensing Group is active in applications for remote
sensing using sensors in the frequency band from VHF to sub millimetre
waves. The aim is to develop applications of new sensors for environmental
monitoring. Satellite applications dominate but airborne and ground-based
techniques are also of interest.
<H2><A NAME="INSAR">Developments in INSAR technology. </A></H2>
<P>
An ESA project for calibration and validation of the SAR for the
future Envisat satellite has been ongoing. Methods for calibration
of the VHF SAR CARABAS have been developed.
<P>
Using two or more SAR images over the same area it is possible
to extract two parameters, coherence and phase. The coherence
is related to the stability on the scale of the radar wavelength
and phase is related to the location of the imaged object. Coherence
has been shown to be a useful tool for classification of different
land covers, see below. 
<P>
For interferometric SAR methods for slope corrections of the radar
backscatter have been developed.
<P>
The phase measurements have been shown to be an accurate measure
of the ground topography in an area in Northern Sweden.
<P>
A semi-automatic differential INSAR processor has been developed
where the inputs are two SAR images and one DEM (Digital Elevation
Model).
<P>
Many of the INSAR developments have been carried out under an
ESA contract co-ordinated by Matra Cap Systems for studying applications
of interferometric SAR. The Remote Sensing Group has had the main
responsibility for forestry.
<H3>Coherence estimation</H3>
<P>
A very important step in INSAR is to estimate coherence and phase
correctly. Coherence estimation is often biased for low coherence.
The bias depends on window size and assumed ground topography
over the window. There is a trade-off between overestimation and
underestimation of the coherence. Overestimation can be decreased
using larger windows but then assumptions of the ground topography
will not longer be valid and that will underestimate the coherence.
Using an available digital elevation model, DEM, will more or
less eliminate the effect of underestimation. Current efforts
are to further analyse the statistics of the images and the known
estimators in order to reduce the bias.
<H3>Temporal and volume decorrelation</H3>
<P>
In the case of a time interval between image acquisitions (repeat-pass
interferometry), the ground area is likely to change, thus causing
temporal decorrelation. Volume decorrelation occurs over areas
which have scatterers distributed over different heights e.g.
in crown, trunk and undergrowth layers in forests. Under many
conditions it is impossible to discriminate between temporal and
volume decorrelation, but when the two images are taken from almost
the same position (within about 100 metres) the volume correlation
becomes negligible,  leaving the temporal decorrelation. Our studies
show that the temporal decorrelation is the major discriminating
factor in INSAR images. The temporal changes can be split into
two factors; geometrical and dielectric changes. Geometrical changes
(due mostly to wind) are believed to be the major cause of decorrelation
in forests on a short time scale (almost instantaneous) while
dielectric changes will work on longer time scales (over a few
days, depending mainly on changes in weather conditions). Tropospheric
influence on INSAR
<P>
For accurate phase measurements the error due to the atmospheric
delay is an important factor, and an investigation of the atmospheric
influence on the accuracy of derived DEM:s from INSAR has started
based on the long experience of water vapour radiometer observations
as well as GPS observations.
<H2><A NAME="Seaice">Remote Sensing of Sea Ice</A></H2>
<H3>Modelling of SAR signatures from sea ice</H3>
<P>
An extensive program on modelling of the radar backscatter from
sea ice has been ongoing for validation of satellite remote sensing
using synthetic aperture radar. Models help in understanding risks
of misinterpretation of single sensor signatures. Level and deformed
ice, frazil, frost flowers, new ice, leads etc. have been studied.
Of special interest has been ice ridges due to the problems associated
with ship navigation, and signatures of frost flowers etc. giving
rise to similar signatures as deformed ice. 
<H3>Baltic Sea Ice</H3>
<H4>EMAC'95</H4>
<P>
For increased information about radar scattering properties multi
frequency is important. Optimal frequency combinations for future
satellite missions are also important to investigate.
<P>
As part of the European Multi-Sensor Airborne Campaign (EMAC-95)on
Snow and Ice 1995 in Finland radar signatures of smooth low-salinity
level ice in the Gulf of Bothnia were measured by means of a ship
mounted scatterometer operating at L, S, C, and X-band. Utilising
the ranging capability of the scatterometer system the dominant
scattering contributions as function of depth in the ice were
located for the different frequencies. Together with <I>in situ</I>
ice and snow observations and using radar scattering modelling
it was found that the X-band scattering is caused by volume inhomogeneities
in the uppermost part of the ice, the C- and S-band scattering
by the roughness of the snow-ice interface, while at L-band dominant
radar returns originate also from the ice-water interface. In
conclusion C- and L-band would be complementary for SAR sea ice
monitoring in the Baltic.
<H4>Sea ice displacements by INSAR</H4>
<P>
Interferometric SAR technique, INSAR, can be used to measure surface
displacements between acquisitions. This has attracted much interest
for earthquake and landslide monitoring. It can also be used to
measure displacements over fast ice. 
<P>
Over the fast ice in the Bay of Bothnia, we have measured displacements
on the cm level over approx. 2010 km<SUP>2</SUP>. Such measurements
are believed to be unique. Current efforts are to model the ice
displacements and compare with INSAR measurements.
<H3>Arctic Sea Ice</H3>
<H4>Ice type classification</H4>
<P>
Ice concentration in the Arctic derived from ERS-1 SAR and the
SSM/I together with field observations consisting of ship observations
and helicopter video from the Arctic-91 expedition were compared.
The studied areas were characterised by melting conditions and
new ice formation with frost flowers. For interpretation temporal
sequences of the SAR images and meteorological information was
used. It was found that SSM/I may underestimate the ice concentration
by 20 per cent due to thin ice formation and melting conditions
while SAR may overestimate. This illustrates the importance of
combining information from different sensors. By using the SAR
estimate of different ice classes it is believed to be possible
to increase the accuracy of the ice concentration. 
<H4>Ice motion derivation</H4>
<P>
 Optical flow and other algorithms have been derived in the group
for ice motion derivation. The basic assumptions in the optical
flow analysis are that image brightness is stationary and the
velocity field is constant within a small neighbourhood. An error
analysis is made and two criteria introduced for testing the possibility
of using the optical flow method. Some smoothing has to take place
in order to increase the estimate accuracy of sea ice motion.
To avoid an ill-conditioned problem a conditioning number is introduced.
A test of the non-uniformity of the velocity field is also introduced.
The two criteria are used for choosing the spatial resolution
suitable for an automatic optical flow analysis. The method has
been applied to three image pairs from Arctic-91 and with a pixel
spacing of 200 m. The rms. error between the automatic method
and manually identified control points in the images was found
to vary between 640 and 730 meters. The same area (the Yermak
plateau) has been observed during the expedition in 1996 and the
work will continue using these images when available. 
<P>
 A matching algorithm based on a similarity measure, the sum-of-squared
difference (SSD), has also been tested with the same three image
pairs as used in the optical flow method. The experimental results
obtained with both optical flow method and SSD method are in a
good agreement. Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996
<H4>Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996</H4>
<P>
Preparations for the Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996 has been ongoing
during the period of the biennial report. A team consisting of
participants from Alfred Wegener Institute, Chalmers University
of Technology, Helsinki University, Helsinki University of Technology,
and SMHI carried out a program in Remote Sensing and Sea Ice in
July - September 1996. Synthetic aperture radar images from RADARSAT
and ERS-2 are provided by support from the Canadian and European
Space Agencies, respectively. 
<H2><A NAME="Forestry">Remote Sensing of land cover and Forestry</A>
</H2>
<H3>Forestry using CARABAS</H3>
<P>
Microwave SAR signatures are saturated at relatively low stem
volumes. Lower frequencies have increased potential to estimate
high stem volumes or biomass. CARABAS is an airborne VHF synthetic
aperture radar system developed by the National Defence Research
Organisation. Images have been provided from Ottenbylund, &Ouml;land,
and from Maine, USA. Field investigations have taken place at
Ottenbylund and it has been shown that the sensitivity for stem
volume has not saturated like higher frequency SAR systems for
the observed stem volume (up to 210 m<SUP>3</SUP>/ha). References
[117-119, 216, 218].
<P>
A program for developing models for the radar scattering is ongoing.
Compared to models developed at higher frequencies it is important
to investigate what forest properties dominate the scattering,
to what extent coherent interactions take place and to what extent
ground penetration takes place. 
<H3>INSAR Forestry applications and land cover applications</H3>
<P>
In order to understand INSAR images over forested areas, it is
important to develop models which relate geophysical parameters
to the parameters in the images, i.e. coherence and phase. The
current forest model is an extension of the &quot;water cloud
model&quot; developed for normal SAR images. It includes the volume
and temporal decorrelation of the forests and also gives a phase
measure. 
<P>
Observations illustrate that the coherence and interferometric
height varies in different images. A model has been developed
based on how the scattering from the forest layers is combined
with ground scattering from areas within the forest, either attenuated
by the canopy or not. Crucial information is the percentage of
open areas within the forest and the attenuation through the canopy
together with the temporal stability of the canopy scattering.
Available information on these properties is limited and uncertain,
but best estimates result in reasonable agreement between theory
and observations. 
<P>
Using the coherence together with the intensity it is possible
to classify different land covers. Results indicate that the separation
of forest from non-forest areas is much easier using coherence
measurements than in intensity images. However, the coherence
results indicate a difficulty in discriminating between open fields
and clear cut areas of forest. In this case the intensity information
can be used to complement coherence measurements. Although we
have concentrated on boreal forests, initial results from an area
in the Amazon rain forest indicate that coherence can still be
used for the important task of identifying areas of cutting within
forested regions.
<H3>DEM production</H3>
<P>
INSAR images can also be used to produce accurate digital height
maps (Digital Elevation Models). An important problem is that
less accurate measurements are derived over forests due to the
low coherence and that the forest will give a contribution to
the height measurement. This effect can be modelled by the above
forest model. However, it is still possible to produce DEM:s from
INSAR images. Over an area in Northern Sweden covered partly with
boreal forests, we have achieved an accuracy of 5 m RMS error
(using 20 m pixel size) for the DEM (compared to a real DEM) for
one INSAR image. Of course, by using several INSAR images the
error will decrease. The bias between the ground level DEM and
the INSAR measured DEM is caused by the forest height. 
<H2><A NAME="Atmosphere">Remote Sensing of the middle atmosphere</A>
</H2>
<P>
In the group the retrieval of vertical profiles from passive radiometric
observations of the middle atmosphere is studied. This work is
performed to analyse the measurements from a ground-based instrument
under construction at Onsala Space Observatory (22.2 and 110-116
GHz) and the aeronomical measurements of the Odin satellite (480-580
GHz). None of the sensors is yet working operationally and the
work has been concentrated on simulating system properties and
estimating different error sources. 
<P>
To study the profile retrieval accuracy of the future observations
is of course of general interest but it can also be a help in
the construction work because the importance of different instrumental
limitations is revealed in the theoretical examination. 
<P>
Simulation of a ground-based observation is relatively straightforward
and focus has been put to comparing the performance of different
retrieval methods. The methods have been studied both theoretically
and practically by inverting simulated spectra. Several important
differences were found but no method was found to be superior
in all occasions, the choice of retrieval scheme must be selected
according to the purpose of the observation. The influence of
different error sources has also been examined. The importance
of suppressing the baseline ripple to enable ozone in the lower
stratosphere to be satisfactory retrieved was shown. 
<P>
To simulate a satellite limb sounding observation is more complex.
A model of the radiative transfer in the atmosphere and the most
important instrumental characteristics of the sensor has been
implemented and observations have been successively simulated.
The expected retrieval accuracy has been studied for different
observation conditions and a number of species, including O<SUB>3</SUB>,
ClO, HNO<SUB>3</SUB>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>O. It was found that the
fixed design of the Odin sub-mm receiver enables simultaneous
observation of at least four species and suggestions on suitable
instrumental settings for observations in the stratosphere and
the mesosphere have been given.
