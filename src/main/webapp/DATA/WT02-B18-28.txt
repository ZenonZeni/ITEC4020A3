<H3>Teachers and House Mothers Assume Management Role

SAN ANDRES, GUATEMALA --   The first community-owned enterprise that promotes conservation in the Maya Biosphere Reserve is now established  in Guatemala.  The EcoEscuela de Espanol, which offers Spanish language classes and environmental education to foreign students will be turned over to an independent corporation of teachers and house mothers this weekend.  
<P>
In 1993, Conservation International (CI), the U.S. Agency for International Development and the San Andres community opened  the EcoEscuela as an environmentally friendly economic alternative for unemployed teachers and householders in town.   The school was designed to promote political support for conservation in the municipality of San Andres as it provides a unique opportunity for students to learn the Spanish language and about Mayan culture and history as well as Guatemala's incredible biological diversity.                                                                     
<P>
The EcoEscuela is the first enterprise to spin-off from Conservation International.   Other enterprises are expected to result from CI's current work in Guatemala , assisting local communities to successfully manage their own small businesses. 
<P>
Located in  the San Andres municipality, a gateway community to the Maya Biosphere Reserve and the county seat for the largest municipality in Guatemala, the EcoEscuela  offers a high profile for successful integration between community members and local authorities.  For example, when cattle owned by a local rancher encroached upon the school's ecological preserve, house mothers  organized a group to alert the municipal government.    The result was an official order to the rancher to remove his cattle from the area.  
<P>
"The ambitious work of the house mothers reflects a growing conservation awareness in San Andres," said Carlos Soza, CI's Guatemala Director.  "The house mothers recognized that EcoEscuela is an economic alternative promoting positive change, and took the steps to transform the school into a permanent institution."
<P>
The EcoEscuela  generates income directly for 60 families and indirectly for dozens more, employing more people than the existing saw mill in San Andres.  This income allows families  to continue their participation in the EcoEscuela and to ensure its success.  Staff members have been taught accounting and business management in order to run the school efficiently.  
<P>
Over the past three years, student enrollment has increased from 100 to more than 600, and the staff have launched several community conservation programs, including a reforestation project and an interpretive nature trail.  
<P>
"The teachers have demonstrated strong ownership to EcoEscuela and through their hard work have successfully helped this school become an independent, well-managed organization,"            said Alex Cano, Director of EcoEscuela.
<P>
As a former students, Jennifer Ito states, "Everyday held unlimited opportunities to learn something new; whether it was a new Spanish word, a new medicinal use of a plant, or a cultural difference."
<P>
"We are proud of the EcoEscuela and what is has done for our community," said Dalia de Puga, one house mother.  "It is helping us preserve a healthy environment and economy for our children.  This is why we have taken the EcoEscuela into our own hands."
<P>
Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to conserve global biological diversity in ecological hotspots – those areas of the world with the highest numbers of species at greatest risk.  CI has projects in more than 20 countries on four continents.
