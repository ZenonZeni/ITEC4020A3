</HEAD><B>Patient Information</B><hr>

<FONT SIZE=2>We are very pleased to provide you with information concerning our In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program.  A brief overview of the IVF Program is described herein.  Additional information will be provided at the time of consultation.<p>
In addition to explaining the IVF/ET (Embryo Transfer) technique, this document describes the major significant and foreseeable risks of the procedures, possible alternatives to IVF/ET, if any, and the responsibilities of couples who participate in our IVF program.
<p><B><I>Introduction</I></B><br>
In order for pregnancy to occur, an egg has to be released from the ovary and unite with a sperm.  Normally this union, called fertilization, occurs within the fallopian tube.  When this process cannot take place in the body, it can be accomplished in the laboratory by using the <A HREF="ivf.htm">In Vitro Fertilization</A> (IVF) technique.  The technique, as currently practiced, involves uniting an egg(s) collected from a woman's ovary with sperm collected from her partner under laboratory conditions.  The resulting normal embryo(s) may be transferred to the uterus (womb) for continued growth.  The benefit of IVF and ET is that it gives a couple who may be unable to achieve a pregnancy an opportunity to attempt to overcome their infertility.

<B><I>Who will benefit from IVF?</I></B><br>
<OL TYPE=1 START=1 COMPACT>
<li> IVF is of demonstrated value for patients with absence or blockage of the fallopian tubes.  IVF is also recommended to those where corrective surgery has either failed and/or is deemed inadvisable.<p>
<li>Couple with infertility related to severe male factor, e.g. lowered sperm counts or motility, antisperm antibodies, or hostile cervical mucus may also be assisted.<p>
<li>Those who have other causes of infertility such as endometriosis, unruptured follicle syndrome or who have unexplained infertility may also receive benefit.<p></OL>
