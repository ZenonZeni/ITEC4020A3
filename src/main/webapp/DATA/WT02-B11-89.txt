<P><B>Expanded Coverage.  </B>We want to call your attention to the initiation
this week of coverage of the Dominican Republic. This is part of <I>Lagniappe's
</I>expanded reporting on Central America and the Caribbean.</P>
<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   The uncooperative fiscal deficit has again
exceeded targets, obliging Cavallo to renegotiate the  IMF accord and forcing
highly visible cuts in social spending.  &#167;  The province of Mendoza plans
to issue a $150 million bond guaranteed by oil royalties. &#167; Five executives
have been penalized for insider trading.  Page 2 </P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   Banking sector consolidation continues with the
merger of banks Itamaraty and BCN, a union that  Bamerindus may also join. The
deal frees soya magnate Olacyr de Moraes to pursue his railroad building dreams
and provides BCN with a management and succession strategy.  &#167;  Tariffs
have been raised on a select list of goods.  &#167;  To the consternation of
business, the proposed tax on checks is headed for approval.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;   The anti-inflation bent of monetary policy is
expected to remain in effect despite the surprise resignation  of the central
bank president.  &#167;  Cruz Blanca is selling a controlling interest in its
pension and insurance businesses to fund expansions in transportation and
infrastructure.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   The US has ratcheted up its running battle with
President Samper over his alleged drug ties by  revoking his visa. Trade actions
and more aggressive arm twisting to curb drug trafficking are likely to be the
next choice of weapons.  &#167;  The airline dispute appears to have been
defused.  &#167;  The proposed telephone sell-off is under fire from the unions.

<P><B>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</B>  &#167;   President-elect Leonel Fernandez will
take office in August with clear, but  daunting, priorities: economic
revitalization, complete overhaul of state industries, and political consensus
building. He starts out with widespread goodwill and a clean victory. But also
with an empty treasury and a pitiful minority in congress.  Page 6</P>
<P><B>ECUADOR</B>  &#167;   The election of populist and self-proclaimed &quot;madman&quot;
Abdala Bucaram as the country's next  president promises a period of controversy
and confusion. Bucaram has awakened popular hopes with his extravagant campaign
promises, for which no economic game plan exists.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>GUATEMALA  </B> &#167;   The government and rebel guerrillas are
hammering out a socioeconomic peace accord that  is being given wide
credibility. The government has also launched a state streamlining initiative
but is still behind in curing security deficiencies and a slow-moving economy. 
Page 8</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;   One of the scandals surrounding the financial
activities of former president Salinas' brother has  created a newsroom furor in
the two television networks and catalyzed a congressional investigation over the
privatization of TV Azteca. The inquiry ostensibly centers on a loan made by
Raul Salinas to the winner of the TV Azteca bid. But in fact the probe is being
used by the left to escalate the debate on privatization.  Page 9</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA</B>  &#167;   The reform program is making slow but measurable
progress: direct investors are showing  interest, the external financial
situation is solid, and steps are being taken to streamline the bureaucracy and
get the privatization process going.  &#167;  The bolivar is steady but the new
crawling peg system of devaluation may need correcting if inflation rises higher
than the programmed amount.  Page 10</P>

VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1" WIDTH="300"><H3>Government Pushes Peace, State
Reform; Economic Woes Linger </H3><P>The government of Alvaro Arzu is making
headway on its top political priority of forging a peace accord with the
guerrillas (LL 3/1/96). It has signed a framework peace plans and mapped out a
$2.3 billion game plan for fulfilling it. And with progress on this front the
president has launched the process of state modernization. The dark spots
remaining the slow-moving economy and the deficient state of personal security.
</P><P><B>Promising Peace Talks. </B>The government's negotiating team and the
commanders of the leftist URNG guerrilla are talking their way towards a formal
end to Guatemala's 35-year-old armed conflict at an impressive pace. The present
round of negotiations on the role of the military in the post-war era and the
demobilization of the URNG began on June 21. An agreement on these issues is
expected by August, and most analysts believe that a final peace accord will be
signed before the year is out. The government of businessman Arzu views progress
as urgent because peace is a necessary condition for the modernizing program.
The URNG is impatient to take advantage of a less repressive political system
and enter the legal political arena, an attitude reinforced by its military
weakness.</P><P>The peace process vaulted forward in early May with the signing
of an accord on social, economic and agrarian issues. The agreement sets the
target of a 50% increase in spending on health and education by 2,000 and sets a
growth goal of 6% p.a. without, however, spelling out how these targets are to
be achieved. A plan for radical changes in the country's notoriously skewed
distribution of land and wealth is absent, and, not surprisingly, groups
representing landless peasants warn that the accord's failure to address what
they see as a fundamental cause of the armed conflict guarantees the
continuation of social tension in the post-war era.</P><P><B>$2.3 Billion
Price Tag. </B>But the socioeconomic accord has been whole-heartedly welcomed by
the private sector and the international financing organizations. This should
help efforts to raise the funds necessary to implement the peace agreements when
they formally come into effect. The government planning agency estimates that
the cost of implementing the accords will be around $2.3 billion; $500 million
for the socioeconomic accord alone, $953 million for the accords signed
previously and the remainder for the ones still to be negotiated. </P><P><B>Fund
Raising Plan. </B>Although the government has invited the guerrillas to
participate in a diplomatic offensive to raise funds, it has retained the
initiative with the formation of a high level commission charged with
elaborating a peace projects priority list divided into four categories. These
are: &quot;emergency&quot; projects for which international donations will be
sought; &quot;integrated social development&quot; projects that are to be funded
by a combination of national and international sources; &quot;state
modernization&quot; projects that will rely on government income and the
multilateral agencies; and &quot;productive development&quot; projects that will
be essentially a matter of attracting foreign investment and negotiating
increased access of Guatemalan products to international markets. </P></TD><TD
VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="2" WIDTH="300"><P>The head of the commission,
government negotiator Richard Aitkenhead, says the government is hoping that 73%
of the total will be provided by the international community. Aitkenhead
envisages that approximately 17% of this will be donated, 6% will take the form
of technical cooperation, and the remaining 77% will have to be paid back. </P><P><B>Pruning
The State. </B>Strengthened by the peace agreement, the government is overcoming
its initial inertia in domestic policy. A flurry of recent legislation focuses
on a state modernization program. In late June vice-president Luis Flores
presented a bill that contemplates a reduction of the bureaucracy and
decentralization of activities away from the central to local governments.
Public sector unions vehemently oppose these moves which they fear will lead to
mass dismissals, but their ability to protest is limited by recent labor
legislation reforms that restrict their right to strike.</P><P><B>Economic
Woes. </B>The current political confidence of the Arzu administration, both
internationally and at home, contrasts with its rather insecure economic
position. State coffers are empty and tax collection is below expectations. The
central government also must cope with a $1 billion plus short term internal
debt it inherited from previous administrations. Central bank figures from the
first few months of 1996 indicate that the economy is performing less well this
year than last.</P><P><B>Security Worries. </B>Most analysts blame the
deceleration on high lending rates and falls in the price of major export crops,
but the less quantifiable factor is worrying levels of organized violent crime.
At the end of June, Humberto Pretti, president of the powerful private sector
group, ACIF, caused a storm with the revelation that over the last eight months
some 140 businessmen have been kidnapped for ransom payments that in some cases
ran into millions of dollars. The government accused Pretti of irresponsible
behavior, and insisted that the security forces are having notable successes
capturing and disbanding kidnapping outfits.</P><P>But there is clearly concern
that violent crime is having a serious impact on confidence, particularly in the
context of recent warnings issued by the US state department to tourists
planning to visit Guatemala. In an effort to show that he is prepared to respond
to the clamor for action, President Arzu has reiterated on several occasions
that the controversial death penalty for kidnappers approved by congress last
year will be applied.</P></TD></TR>
