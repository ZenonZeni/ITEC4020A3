Moves on Immigration

<tt>In June 1995, the House and Senate took actions that are likely to reduce
legal immigration and increase efforts to reduce illegal immigration.  If
enacted, US residents who sponsor the admission of their relatives would be
required to support them, and immigrants may be barred from public assistance
programs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate immigration subcommittee marked up and approved the Immigrant
Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1995 (S 269) on June 14, 1995 by a
vote of 4-2.  The bill, sponsored by Sen. Alan Simpson (R-WY), deals primarily
with illegal immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>Employers who hired illegal aliens could, if S269 is enacted, face double
penalties if they also are found to have willfully or repeatedly violated the
Fair Labor Standards Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker
Protection Act, or the Family and Medical Leave Act.  The bill would add 300
INS inspectors to enforce laws against alien smuggling and unlawful employment
of illegal immigrants, nearly doubling their number.</tt><p>
<tt>Penalties for hiring illegal aliens would be increased.  For a first
violation, the fine would go from $250 to $1,000 per illegal alien hired.  The
Administration is given eight years to develop an automated system through
which US employers can determine whether newly hired workers are legally
authorized to work in the US, adopting a recommendation of the CIR in September
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Justice Department supports testing an automated verification system,
but it opposes the eight-year timetable to have such a system in place.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would also require Social Security numbers to be issued with
standardized national birth certificates and, when a person reaches 16 years,
he/she must add a biological identifier to the Social Security card or similar
work authorization document, such as a fingerprint.  A $1 border crossing fee
was included in the subcommittee bill, with the moneys raised used to add
inspectors to speed up legal crossings.  The bill also authorizes the hiring of
3,500 additional Border Patrol agents.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would also increase the responsibilities of an immigrant's
sponsor to financially support any immigrants they sponsor or petition to have
admitted to the US.  It would also make illegal immigrants ineligible for most
public assistance programs, whether funded by federal, state, or local
governments.</tt><p>
<tt>The subcommittee rejected the 50,000 per year cap on annual refugee
admissions recommended by the CIR, but included a provision that requires
applicants for asylum to file their applications within 30 days of arriving in
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 21, 1995, House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims chair Lamar
Smith (R-TX) held a press conference to announce that he would be introducing
the Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995 to reduce legal and
illegal immigration.  A hearing Smith's proposal, which deals with both legal
and illegal immigration, was held on June 29.</tt><p>
<tt>Under Smith's proposal, legal immigration would be reduced by about
one-third to about 535,000 per year, and employers would be required to check
the Social Security numbers of new hires.  The US Border Patrol would be
doubled to 10,000, and aliens who enter the US illegally could be fined $50 to
$250.</tt><p>
<tt>Smith's 300-page proposal would maintain the three "front doors" though
which legal immigrants enter the US, but each would be narrowed.  Spouses and
minor children of US citizens could continue to enter the US in unlimited
numbers (about 195,000 per year today); up to 85,000 spouses and minor children
of legal permanent residents would be admitted each year; and up to 50,000
parents of US citizens could immigrate, making family immigration 330,000 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Smith's proposal would keep immigrants admitted for economic reasons at
about current levels by permitting the annual entry of 135,000 skilled workers,
professionals, managers and investors.  Up to 70,000 refugees, accepted
applicants for asylum, and other humanitarian immigrants could be admitted each
year.  For five years, Smith would permit an additional 50,000 spouses and
children of legal residents on waiting lists to enter the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants who sponsor their relatives for admission would be legally
responsible for ensuring that they do not become "public charges" during their
first seven years in the US.  Becoming a public charge is defined as receiving
means-tested public assistance for 12 or more months within seven years of
arrival.</tt><p>
<tt>Smith's bill does not include a border-crossing fee or an agricultural
guest worker program.  It does include a number of pilot programs, such as the
collection of departure records to determine how many tourists and other
non-immigrants do not depart as scheduled; the use of closed military bases to
detain aliens; and the return of aliens apprehended to the interior of their
countries of origin.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 29, a 54-member House Task Force headed by Rep Gallegly (R-CA)
released a report that upped the ante in efforts to reduce illegal immigration
to the US.  The Task Force's 150 page report recommends that illegal aliens be
barred from receiving all public benefits except for emergency health care, and
that, to be reimbursed, a hospital would have to notify the INS before
releasing emergency unauthorized patients.  Illegal alien children would be
barred from attending public schools, and aliens apprehended attempting to
enter the US illegally would be subject to escalating fines and penalties,
including forfeiture of their assets.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The Senate approved a welfare reform proposal in June that goes
further than the House welfare reform approved in March 1995 by making it
harder for some immigrants to obtain Supplemental Security Income (SSI) even
after they become naturalized US citizens.  Under the Senate welfare proposal,
an applicant for SSI would be asked if he or she had a sponsor.  If the
immigrant had a sponsor, then the applicant for SSI would be deemed to have
available to him/her, in additional to his/her own income, the sponsor's
income, for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI payments.</tt><p>
<tt>There is no current bar to legal immigrants applying for most public
assistance programs.  Immigrants who apply are asked if they had a sponsor to
get into the US and, if they did, they can be "deemed" under a few programs to
have access to their sponsors' income for three to five years.  Welfare reforms
would expand the number of assistance programs for which sponsors' income can
be deemed to be available to the immigrant applicant for assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The House welfare reform bill was criticized for denying federal assistance
under five programs to legal immigrants until they become US citizens (MN,
April 1995), but deeming under the House bill would end when the immigrant
became a US citizen.  The Senate bill, critics allege, would change the US
tradition of equal treatment for all US citizens by creating two classes of US
citizens, those who were born in the US, and those who were naturalized US
citizens with sponsors.</tt><p>
<tt>Sen. Simpson, who sponsored the amendment, argued that immigrants should be
self supporting.  There were 738,000 aliens receiving SSI in December 1994,
including 16 percent from Mexico, 10 percent from the ex-USSR, seven percent
each from Cuba and Vietnam, and five percent each from China and the
Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal that the Clinton
Administration's decision to admit Cuban children from Guantanamo, and return
170 Haitian children, amounted to illegal discrimination, thereby affirming the
right of the US to return these Haitian children to Haiti. On June 27, 111
Haitians, including 74 children were flown to the US.  There are still 210
Haitians in Guantanamo, including 48 unaccompanied children. </tt><p>

Recommends Less

<tt>The nine-member US Commission on Immigration Reform, headed by Barbara
Jordan, recommended at a June 7 press conference that legal immigration be
gradually reduced, and that priority for entry be reshuffled to emphasize the
unification of nuclear families in the US and the admission of college-educated
foreigners needed to fill US jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR tackled the difficult trade-offs inherent in deciding how to select
immigrants.  If enacted, the CIR proposal would keep immigration at roughly
current levels for the next five years, but favor nuclear over extended
families.  The CIR recommended that Congress review immigration levels every
three to five years.</tt><p>
<tt>After the new plan is fully phased in, family unification would remain the
primarily door for immigrants to enter the US, accounting for 400,000
immigrants per year.  Immediate family members of US citizens--spouses,
children, and parents-- would gain admission upon application, but three of the
four existing family preferences would be eliminated--those that permit the
unmarried adult sons and daughters, the married sons and daughters, and the
brothers and sisters of US citizens to gain priority to immigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of immigrants admitted because of their skills or to fill vacant
US jobs would be reduced from 140,000 to 100,000 per year.  Most immigrants
admitted for economic reasons would need a BS or equivalent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Instead of the current labor certification system, US employers who are
granted permission to bring immigrants into the US to fill job vacancies would
have to pay "substantial fees" that would be used to educate and train US
workers.  US employers would also have to pay the immigrants at least five
percent more than prevailing wages to ensure that their presence does not
depress the wages of US workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants admitted with US offers of employment would be "conditional" for
two years.  They would become permanent immigrants only if they had the same
job or had good reason to change jobs after their two-year probation.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR recommended that the 10,000 immigrant visas currently made
available for unskilled immigrants--the visas that some Americans use to permit
their nannies or gardeners to become immigrants--be eliminated.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of refugees admitted annually would be reduced from about
120,000 annually to 50,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR would soften the impact of the family unification changes by
accelerating the unification of nuclear families, making 150,000 additional
visas per year available until the 1.2 million backlog of spouses and minor
children waiting to join permanent immigrants in the US is eliminated (the
current second family preference).  However, another 1.9 million foreigners on
waiting lists to enter as, e.g., the brothers and sisters of US citizens, or as
the married children of US citizens, could not immigrate under these
preferences, which would be eliminated.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR also urged that efforts to integrate immigrants be stepped up by
making widely available English language instruction and civics
education.</tt><p>
<tt>If the CIR's recommendations are adopted, about 30 percent of the 1993
immigrants from the Dominican Republic, India, Jamaica, and Hong Kong would
have been excluded.  About 12 percent of Mexican immigrants would have been
excluded.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton and most major newspapers endorsed the CIR's
recommendations--Clinton called them pro-family and pro-work, and urged
Congress to consider the CIR's recommendations as a road map to revamp
immigration policy.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics complained that the CIR was blurring the distinction between legal
and illegal immigration.  House majority leader Dick Armey (R-TX) argued that
legal immigration is good for the US, and should be increased.  Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) called the recommended cuts an unfair backlash in response to
California's Proposition 187.  Ethnic groups, churches, and some employers also
criticized the CIR's recommendations, accusing the CIR of bowing to
anti-immigrant pressures.  </tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants tend to be concentrated at the extremes of the education and
income spectrums--they are more likely than native-born residents to have not
completed high school or to have completed college or more--and that those at
the bottom of the US job ladder are depressing wages for immigrants as well as
natives, helping to explain why the gap between the earnings of college
graduates and high school dropout has risen by more than 50 percent over the
past 20 years.</tt><p>
<tt>The CIR recommended in September 1994 that efforts to prevent illegal
aliens form obtaining US jobs be stepped up, and that the US experiment with
computer methods for employers to check whether newly-hired workers were
authorized to work in the US.  In February 1995, President Clinton endorsed
this recommendation, and Congress is considering proposals to implement pilot
worker verification systems.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Pros
and Cons of Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Economist Julian Simon, who has long advocated immigration as an economic
panacea, joined politicians such as Governor Wilson (R-CA) in arguing that the
US should re-create the "successful" bracero program that brought almost five
million Mexicans to US farm jobs between 1942 and 1964.  Some Mexicans returned
year after year, so only one to two million individuals participated.</tt><p>
<tt>Simon argued for a guest worker program under which foreign workers would
be permitted to remain in the US for three to five years, with priority given
to illegal alien workers already in the US.  Guest workers would be encouraged
to return to their countries of origin by wage and income tax deductions that
would be returned as departure bonuses.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Simon, the main obstacle to such a guest worker program is
"lack of a political constituency," meaning politically weak restaurant owners
and farmers. </tt><p>
<tt>California farmers developed a proposal in February 1995 to substitute an
attestation procedure for the current certification procedure through which
foreign farm workers are legally admitted if US workers are not available to
fill vacant US jobs.  Under attestation, the employer opens the door to foreign
workers, and the door remains open until there is a complaint and
administrative action closes the door.  Under certification, by contrast, the
door to foreign workers remains closed until the government takes action to
open it.</tt><p>
<tt>There is widespread opposition to calls for a new agricultural guest worker
program.  The CIR in June recommended against such a program: "a large scale
agricultural guest worker program...is not in the national interest...such a
program would be a grievous mistake."  The chairs of the Senate and House
immigration subcommittees, Simpson and Smith, have announced their
opposition.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 23, President Clinton issued a statement opposing an agricultural
guest worker program, asserting that a guest worker program would increase
illegal immigration, displace US workers, and depress wages and working
conditions.  Clinton said that "If our crackdown on illegal immigration
contributes to labor shortages.... I will direct the departments of Labor and
Agriculture to work cooperatively to improve and enhance existing programs to
meet the labor requirements of our vital agricultural industry consistent with
our obligations to American workers."</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's statement highlights the difference between his view of opposing
guest workers to protect low-wage US workers and that of Wilson, a candidate
for the Republican presidential nomination, who proposes to admit guest
workers, implicitly agreeing with farmers who say that US workers will not do
farm work.  </tt><p>
<tt>Western growers attacked Clinton's statement, arguing that the
Administration should review it before dismissing their proposal.  The growers
proposal, reportedly contained in a 35-page bill that Senator Kyl (R-AZ) is
prepared to offer as an amendment to Simpson's immigration reform bill, would
permit employers to attest that they face labor shortages despite recruiting
workers at prevailing wages, to be recruited by associations, farmers or farm
labor contractors, and to be shifted from farm to farm as needed, and permit
foreign workers to remain in the US for up to 36 months.  Up to 30 percent of
each worker's wages could be withheld and sent to the US consulate nearest
their hometown for pickup, or forfeited by workers who failed to appear to
collect the withheld wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Fear that western growers may nonetheless succeed in winning a guest worker
program is based on their success in 1984-85.  Clinton's Chief of Staff Leo
Panetta, then in the House, and Governor Wilson, then a senator, successfully
made the arguments for agricultural guest workers over the strenuous objections
of the chairs of the immigration subcommittees.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1995 fight over farm workers is shaping up as a repeat of that of a
decade earlier.  It appears that Rep Gallegly (R-CA) and Kyl will play the
roles played by Panetta and Wilson in the mid-1980s.  Gallegly June 28 asserted
that 50 percent of California farm workers are illegal, and that California
growers need a guestworker program.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the mid-1980s argument that effective enforcement may lead to
labor shortages that must be met with special farm worker programs may not be
as credible in the mid-1990s, since there is already a certification program
through which farmers who cannot find US workers can request legal foreign
workers, and a history that includes worker abuse in agriculture may make it
hard to approve an attestation program that relies on self-enforcement.</tt><p>

Enters Phase
2</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 23, the INS announced Phase Two of its effort to reduce illegal
immigration over the US border south of San Diego.  According to the INS,
Gatekeeper has made it more difficult for individual aliens to enter the US, so
they are responding by using smugglers, attempting entry further east, and
using false documents in an effort to enter the US through the port of
entry.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will add agents to the border and staff at the ports of entry in a
stepped up effort to discourage illegal entries.  The US Attorney's Office
promised to charge smugglers and document forgers with felonies rather than
misdemeanors, meaning that those convicted could be sent to prison.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will also keep open border checkpoints in San Clemente and
Temecula, which drew criticism from local officials.  Some local officials
claim the checkpoints do not halt illegal immigration, just divert it to the
canyons and fields of coastal and inland cities, where there are few border
agents.  The INS likes the checkpoints because it forces smugglers to stop
instead of making a straight run to Los Angeles.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since Operation Gatekeeper began, the INS raided 53 so-called "drop
houses," apprehending 2,500 migrants and 69 smugglers. </tt><p>
<tt>Operation Gatekeeper was launched October 1, 1994 to deter illegal entries
in the area with the most legal and illegal crossings--the 20-some miles of
border between San Diego and Tijuana.  After eight months, two facts are
clear--the number of persons apprehended along the southern border has
increased, but more aliens being apprehended in previously little-used crossing
areas, such as the easternmost sections of the San Diego area border, and in
Arizona.</tt><p>
<tt>Apprehension data are always hard to interpret.  Since Gatekeeper was
launched, there have been two other significant events--Mexico has slipped into
recession, and California added over 200,000 new jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has not released officially one indicator of which of these three
factors may be most important in explaining what is happening to illegal border
crossings-- the recidivism rate, or the number of illegal aliens who have been
apprehended several times (each alien apprehended is fingerprinted).
Unofficial reports are that about 30 percent of the 200,000 persons apprehended
and fingerprinted were caught before in the San Diego area.</tt><p>
<tt>Apprehensions in the westernmost sector--Imperial Beach--were down 52
percent in April compared to the same month last year.  Arrests in Chula Vista,
Brown Field and El Cajon--east of the port of entry--rose 34 percent, 126
percent and 824 percent, respectively, in April compared with the same period
last year.  The INS has added 53 agents to El Cajon to deal with the increase
of illegal entries. </tt><p>
<tt>These data can be interpreted to mean that Gatekeeper is having its
intended effect of discouraging illegal entries, or that the INS has not
altered the historical probability of being apprehended, which is about 30
percent.  If Gatekeeper is working, then the recidivism rate might be 100
percent--no one slips through--or 0, if aliens are so discouraged that only
first-timers make the attempt.  </tt><p>
<tt>If Gatekeeper has not changed the 30 percent probability of a typical
individual being apprehended, then it must be determined whether the number of
attempts and apprehensions would have been higher but for Gatekeeper, or
whether, despite the investment in better border controls, the INS has not
changed the probability of apprehension.</tt><p>
<tt>In a major three-part series, the Los Angeles Times on June 18-20 agreed
with the INS that there has not yet been a "tidal wave" of unauthorized Mexican
immigrants headed to the US.  The INS attributes the increased number of
apprehensions to the increased number of Border Patrol agents.  The Los Angeles
Times added Prop 187 and the feeling in Mexico that California is no longer a
economic and social beacon.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexican researchers in Tijuana emphasize that the Gatekeeper has increased
the cost of waiting to cross the border, and the cost of coyotes, making it
harder for cash-strapped migrants to raise the $1,000 often needed to elude the
Border Patrol, get into the US, and find a job.  Once in the US, migrants
report increased difficulty finding jobs that offer steady work at more than
the minimum wage.</tt><p>
<tt>Most reports from Mexican villages and US work places suggest that
potential and actual illegal entrants are aware of Gatekeeper, but that most
believe they can still enter the US and find jobs.  There are reportedly an
increasing range of persons seeking US entry and jobs--well-educated teachers
and engineers, some who went into debt to buy houses and consumer goods in
anticipation of a continued economic boom, are reportedly joining small farmers
in the trek north.  Some of these better-educated Mexicans reportedly attempt
to enter the US through ports-of-entry with false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>In a profile of Jiquilpan, Michoacan, a township of 60,000 in western
Mexico that has traditionally sent migrants to the US, the Los Angeles Times
reports that the networks or settlement of anchor friends and relatives in the
US over the past 50 years enabled residents to think of the US labor market as
a safety valve.  However, solo male seasonal migration became family emigration
in the late 1980s, and the settlement of especially younger families in the US
helps to explain both the backlash in California over the costs of immigration,
and the fact that Mexican villages have disproportionately older
residents.</tt><p>
<tt>As in other countries with a tradition of seasonal and permanent migration
to the US, some in Jiquilpan complain that US culture and problems have invaded
rural Mexico, and some residents think that, in an environment in which drugs
and gangs have moved south, they may as well move north where at least
opportunities are better. </tt><p>
<tt>In Lennox near the Los Angeles International airport, residents who
originally came from Jiquilpan report that there are few jobs in nearby hotels
and restaurants for those who elude the Border Patrol.  The 25,000 residents
are 95 percent Latino, and many complain that there are so many workers looking
for jobs that many employers do not raise wages above the $4.25 hourly minimum,
and do require workers to accept split shifts and unpredictable hours.  Some
residents believe that stepped up border controls will encourage any
unauthorized migrants who succeed in making it to the US to settle here until
they obtain legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>Complaints about abuse by Border Patrol agents has increased.  There have
been as many reports of abuse in the first four months of 1995 as in all of
1994.  Human Rights Watch/Americas issued a report this month detailing a
"climate of impunity" along the border. </tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) has introduced a bill that would require the INS
to build two more fences near the border, and station two Border Patrol agents
every 250 yards along this border. </tt><p>
<tt>On May 19, the INS reported that it broke a $12 million per year business
that supplied perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the counterfeit identification
produced for unauthorized aliens.  The business offered individuals the
identification needed to work "legally" for $120 to $180; this suggests monthly
sales of identification to about 6,700 persons.  The business operated from
vans in supermarket parking lots, with aliens dropping off pictures and money,
and receiving identification within one hour.</tt><p>
<tt>About 300 of the INS's 1,800 investigators enforce the employer sanctions
provisions of IRCA within the US; there are 5,000 Border Patrol officers to
deter illegal entry.  The INS will ask Congress to reduce from the current 29
to six the number of documents that can be provided to employers to verify
authorization to work--passports, Social Security cards, drivers licenses, INS
documents, and tribal documents.</tt><p>

 Scheduled</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A trial of the constitutionality of Proposition 187 is scheduled to begin
on September 5, 1995 in federal court in Los Angeles.  In May, California
succeeded in consolidating the various challenges to Prop 187, and putting them
on a fast track, so that the trial could start sooner.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Lawyers Guild announced plans to use volunteer lawyers and
students in California during the summer of 1995 to launch a "new civil rights
movement" to oppose Prop 187 and to preserve affirmative action.  A bill is
pending in Congress to enact a national version of Proposition 187.</tt><p>
<tt>Prop 187 is blamed or credited with re-opening debates over several
immigrant-related programs, including bi-lingual education.  Defenders of
teaching children in their native language, as mandated by the federal
Bilingual Education Act of 1967, see efforts to restructure immigrant
children's education as another example of immigrant bashing.  Supporters of
reform argue that, finally, parental pressure is challenging a flawed
concept.</tt><p>
<tt>California currently spends about $400 million annually "extra"--for
bonuses to teachers, aides, and materials-- to educate 1.2 million Limited
English Proficient pupils--one-third of all LEP students are in California.
Between 1981 and 1989, California required local school districts to teach LEP
students primarily in their own language.  The mandate has expired.</tt><p>
<tt>About 80 percent of the LEP students in California speak Spanish.  Even
though the number of LEP students doubled in the state, the number who
transition to all-English classes has remained at about 60,000 per year.  To
speed up the transition to English-only classes, California permits schools who
cannot find enough native language teachers to use English-as-a-
Second-Language (ESL) instruction.  ESL-taught students generally make the
transition to regular classes within three years.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles Unified School District, with about half of California's LEP
students, in 1988 developed a master plan for bilingual education that mandates
native language instruction.  However, there are only 11,000 fully credentialed
bilingual teachers in California one for every 112 LEP students.  The number of
non-English-speaking students rose by 150 percent since 1985, while the number
of bilingual teachers increased by 30 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>It is hard to get agreement on which teaching strategy is best.  ESL
students score higher than other students on English tests, but native-language
students score better on standardized tests of subject matter.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 31, 1995, a California Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that all
applicants for driver's licenses must provide Social Security Numbers.  The
ruling upholds state laws intended to prevent illegal aliens from obtaining
driver's licenses.</tt><p>
<tt>The California Civil Rights Initiative, which would end racial and ethnic
preferences in state university admissions and contracting, remains popular
with voters, even though it has not yet qualified for the ballot.  A June poll
found that 56 percent of those polled plan to vote for the CCRI.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Detained
Aliens Riot</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In New Jersey, some of the 300 illegal aliens detained in a facility
operated for the INS by a private company, Esmor, attempted to take several
guards hostage to protest what they termed inadequate facilities.  All of those
detained had attempted to enter the US without documents, or with false
documents.  </tt><p>
<tt>On June 27, the INS announced that it was continuing its investigation of
Esmor.  The investigation was expected to completed by June 30, but as a result
of the disturbance the scope of the investigation is being broadened. </tt><p>
<tt>After the riot, all of the detained aliens were moved to county jails and
to other detention facilities, and local officials upset at poor management
threatened to prevent the jail's reopening.</tt><p>
<tt>Esmor is one of about 20 US companies that have profited from the
increasing number of aliens detained because it receives from the INS $75 to
$100 per detained alien per day.  Guards are paid about $8 to $9 per hour to
keep aliens in detention, and food was reportedly provided under a $1.12 per
person per day contract.</tt><p>
<tt>Esmor argued that the cause of the riot in New Jersey was the fact that
aliens were detained more than six months due to INS failures to process them
quickly, not conditions at the facility.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced plans to begin random employer audits to check compliance
with the I-9 provisions of IRCA.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the INS opened 2,200 investigations of employers believed to be
hiring illegal aliens; 1,400 employers were assessed $11 million for
violations.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS plans 4,400 investigations in 1995.</tt><p>

<tt>Ron Prince, a leader of the Proposition 187 campaign, is a backer of what
is being called Save Our State II -- an effort to amend the US Constitution to
end automatic citizenship for babies born on U.S. soil.  In 1991, 96,000 US
citizen babies were born to unauthorized mothers in California, including
29,000 in Los Angeles County.  </tt><p>
<tt>The 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, adopted after the Civil War in
1868, sought to clarify that the children of slaves were US citizens: "All
persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State
wherein they reside . . ."  The US Supreme Court has never faced the question
of whether babies born to unauthorized alien mothers should be entitled to US
citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>There are two broad principles that govern birth citizenship--jus
sanguinis,  citizenship based on blood, and jus soli, citizenship based on the
soil where the baby is born.  The US and 12 other nations-- including Canada,
Spain, Venezuela and Ireland -- follow both principles, thereby granting
citizenship to people with either blood or soil ties to their countries.</tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be a lively discussion of the record number of
naturalization applications being filed by some of the 10 million aliens
eligible to become naturalized US citizens.  Applications for US citizenship
are up 80 percent in 1995 versus 1994, and up 500 percent in Los Angeles.  The
INS expects 725,000 naturalization applications in 1995, and 925,000 in
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The consensus seems to be that the wave of naturalization applications<b>
</b>is due to a combination of the fact that three million legalized aliens
have become eligible to apply, that the INS required some of these aliens to
replace the green cards that demonstrate their immigrant status for a fee about
equal to the cost of naturalization, and that Prop 187 in California and
Congressional efforts to exclude non-US citizens from most federal welfare
programs illustrated as never before the benefits of US citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Interviews with applicants for naturalization in Los Angeles indicate that
personal reasons dominate:  such as<b> </b>a desire to join the California
Highway Patrol and ease of travel with a US passport.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1150 INS examiners handle over five million petitions annually for
items that range from work permits and green cards to naturalization.  Even
though aliens pay fees for these services, backlogs are mounting, and user fees
are piling up, because the INS has been under a hiring freeze.</tt><p>
<tt>Applicants for naturalization complete an INS N-400 form, pay a fee, and
then wait to be scheduled for an interview with an INS examiner.  After the
examiner certifies their knowledge of English and civics, naturalization
applicants take the oath of allegiance before a federal judge.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey that included 400 immigrants done for Fannie Mae found that 77
percent of those who are not yet US citizens would like to become citizens,
usually in order to vote.  Immigrants define integration in terms of obtaining
a college degree, getting involved in a child's school, and owning a
home.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants who rent are more likely than native-born renters to want to buy
a home--about three times more immigrant renters than all renters said that
their number one priority was to buy a home.  Some interpret the immigrant
desire for home ownership as a sign that immigrants are more likely than
natives to be optimistic about the American economy and its future.</tt><p>

Predicts Economic Growth</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>President Zedillo, in his first major economic speech since the December
1994 peso crisis, predicted that after Mexico pulls out of its current
recession, it can grow annually at five percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>To raise revenue, the government in 1995 is planning its third major round
of privatization since the mid-1980s.  The first two privatization rounds
raised about $22 billion and, as part of the March 1995 bailout agreement,
Mexico promised to raise $12 to $14 billion in 1995 through the sale of
state-owned enterprises.</tt><p>
<tt>Privatization has a mixed record in Mexico.  The telephone monopoly was
simply transferred to private hands, and service failed to improve
significantly.  As smaller companies fail in the current round of bankruptcies
caused by recession and high interest rates, there is a risk that large
companies will swallow up their smaller competitors, increasing monopoly power

<tt>Foreign investors continue to invest in Mexico.  American companies that
reportedly doubled their long-term investments in Mexico to a cumulative $31
billion since 1991, and almost $9 billion in 1995, are cutting profit margins
and taking other steps to maintain market share despite Mexico's recession.
</tt><p>
<tt>Indians, who are about 10 percent of Mexico's 92 million people, are
reportedly being caught up in Mexico's drug wars.  The Indians in the Sierra
Madre mountains 250 miles south of El Paso reportedly hide marijuana and opium
poppy plants in their corn; drug violence in the region is increasing. </tt><p>
<tt>In FY94, about 660,000 Mexicans legally entered the US as non-immigrant
visitors, up 10 percent over FY93.  Almost 80 percent were
tourist/business/shopper visitors, who have B1/B2/BCC visas.  About 12,600 were
temporary workers or trainees, and 374 were NAFTA professionals--persons
permitted to enter the US to conduct NAFTA-related business here.</tt><p>
<tt>Formal negotiations for Chile's entrance to NAFTA began on June 7, 1995 in
Canada.  President Clinton has voiced support for fast-track legislation to
authorize Chile's accession to NAFTA by the end of 1995.  Labor and
environmental groups are pressing for side agreements.</tt><p>
<tt>Under NAFTA's environmental side agreement, the Montreal-based North
American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC) has agreed to
investigate the death of thousands of birds in the Mexican state of Guanajuato.
</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's National Administrative Office (NAO), which investigates
complaints of violations of labor laws in the US, asked the US government to
investigate whether the US telephone company Sprint violated US labor laws when
it fired 177 Spanish-speaking employees in San Francisco in 1994.  The US NAO
concluded in April 1995 that Sony Mexico had mishandled the firing of 45
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Since NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, over 50,000 US workers
have filed petitions asserting that they lost their jobs because of imports
from Mexico or Canada, or because their US employers moved operations to one of
these countries.</tt><p>
<tt>In south Texas, where 1,400 so-called colonias have about 340,000
residents, many recent Mexican immigrants, developers will be required to
provide water and sewer connections before re-selling land for housing.  A 1989
law permitted developers who had already established sub-divisions to expand
them without providing sewer and water hookups, saddling Texas with an
infrastructure bill estimated at $1 billion or more. </tt><p>

Immigration and Local
Elections</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The National Front, a party that seeks to stop immigration to France, won
control of three large French cities in municipal voting on June 18, including
Toulon, the country's largest Mediterranean port city.  National Front
candidates were also elected mayors of Orange and Marignagne, a suburb of
Marseilles.  During victory rallies, National Front leader Le Pen promised to
implement "national preference" and "the French come first" policies in
municipal jobs and subsidized housing.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics argued that national preference will slow the integration of
immigrants into French society.  Several called for boycotts of cities with
National Front mayors.</tt><p>
<tt>The German town of Ratstatt suspended links after 30 years with its French
sister city, Orange, after the election.  Rastatt's Social Democratic mayor
felt there was no way to work with the "inhumane policies" of the National
Front.  The Belgian city of Liege also  broke ties on June 20 with the French
city of Toulon. </tt><p>
<tt>In Dreux, a city of 37,000 west of Paris that is 28 percent immigrant, the
National Front's candidate for mayor used fear of immigration and crime to take
the lead in the race for mayor, but was not elected mayor.  Many of the
immigrants in Dreux were imported to fill jobs that have since disappeared, so
that unemployment among immigrant youth who live in the high-rise  apartments
around town is around 33 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Grand, immigrant youth in early June went
on a rampage after a young Moroccan on a stolen motorbike crashed into traffic
lights attempting to elude police.  Most of the 57,000 residents are of North
African origin, and unemployment there exceeds the average rate of 12
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>When Romanian gypsies began to claim asylum in Lyon, anti-foreigner
sentiment reportedly rose.  Many gypsies went to Lyon under the mistaken
impression that the city would provide refuge.  The Socialist mayor in the city
of Saint-Priest, outside Lyon, resigned his job, claiming that the city was
overburdened with poor immigrants.  Nearly all the mainstream city council
members followed his example.  There are an estimated two million gypsies in
Romania, and many pay to be smuggled into Germany and France.  </tt><p>
<tt>On June 20, French police arrested 140 North Africans living in France who
were suspected of supporting groups seeking to overthrow the governments of
Algeria and Tunisia.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 22, the new French government announced that the minimum age would
be raised to $US 7.60 per hour, and that employers would not  have to pay
social security and health insurance taxes on workers paid less than $US 1,533F
per month.  These measures are intended to reduce the current 12.2 percent
unemployment rate.</tt><p>
<tt>The French government announced on June 12 that it may seek to extend the
trial phase for the Schengen accord, which abolished border controls among
seven EU member states.  France was expected to implement the Schengen accord
in March, 1995, but asked for a six month delay.  One reason for the delay is
the disagreement between France with her neighbors, Belgium and Germany, about
the right to pursue suspected offenders in a neighboring country and a clash
with the Dutch about drug controls and security at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.

<tt>Unemployment in Germany fell below 3.5 million or to nine percent in May
1995, although the rate in the former East Germany remained above 13 percent.
In the east, there is disproportionately large employment in construction--15
percent of the work force--while in the west, there is a concentration of
employment in manufacturing--33 percent of the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>In response to a June 15 protest by 6,000 construction workers in Berlin,
the German government agreed to consider a new law ensuring that foreign
workers are paid the same minimum wages on building sites as Germans.  The
construction workers protested the employment in Berlin of foreign
workers--most from other EU countries such as the UK--at wages less than
prevailing German wages.  </tt><p>
<tt>The bill will be considered by the Parliament in the fall and should become
law next year.  The law will remain in force for only two years and will apply
to workers employed directly in construction, but not those in related trades
such as electricians and painters.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign construction workers are cheaper because employers do not have to
make German social welfare and health contributions on their behalf, and they
are not covered by German laws that regulate work hours, severance pay, or
minimum wages. According to one employer calculation, the total cost of
employing a German construction worker is $57 per hour, about four times the
cost of a Portuguese worker. </tt><p>
<tt>Germany on August 1, 1994 allowed private employment agencies for the first
time to place all kinds of workers in permanent jobs--previously, private
employment agencies could only match managerial or professional persons such as
models with jobs, and place unskilled workers in temporary jobs.  By May 1995,
some 2,200 private employment agencies had been certified to operate in
competition with the public Employment Service, but they made only 3,000
placements between August and December 1994, far less than the pace needed to
make the projected 100,000 placements in their first year.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first five months of 1995, almost 50,000 foreigners applied for
asylum in Germany.  Almost half of the 9,400 applications in May 1995 were from
ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 200 churches have begun to shelter some rejected asylum seekers in an
effort to prevent their deportation.  Reportedly, 2,000 asylum seekers have
sought asylum in churches since 1984.</tt><p>
<tt>There are between 60,000 and 100,000 Vietnamese living in Germany.
Vietnamese who are denied work permits allegedly support themselves by selling
contraband cigarettes on street corners in Berlin and other German cities.
Fighting over the cigarette trade has led to the death of 19 people in Berlin.
There have also been claims that the police are targeting foreigners for
beatings.</tt><p>
<tt>This summer, Germany will deport<b> </b>the first 2,500 of<b> </b>40,000<b>
</b>Vietnamese<b> </b>who applied for asylum and were refused, and those who
entered, sometimes illegally, into Germany in the early 1990s.  More than
50,000 Vietnamese accepted $2,000 bonuses in 1990-91 and left for
Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the agreement between Hanoi and Bonn, Vietnam will accept the 40,000
undocumented Vietnamese by the year 2000 and Bonn will pay Hanoi at least $72
million to assist with their repatriation.  During the two-year negotiations,
the primary stumbling block was how much money Bonn would have to pay Vietnam
to take back the illegal immigrants as soon as possible. </tt><p>
<tt>The 40,000 Vietnamese scheduled for deportation were among the 100,000 who
once resided in East  Germany.  Local officials and judges have granted either
permanent residence permits or "tolerance papers" to about 60,000 allowing them
to stay and work in the reunified Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Some German legislators, including the government's special representative
for the affairs of alien residents, favor granting residency to the Vietnamese
on political and humanitarian grounds. </tt><p>
<tt>Eastern Europe is expecting many of the Vietnamese to flee there instead of
waiting for repatriation to Vietnam.  Eastern European government officials are
especially concerned about criminals, such as the Vietnamese mafia, that may
enter their countries. </tt><p>
<tt>A Czech Republic diplomat said that Vietnamese are already starting to
cross from Germany to the Czech Republic, where Vietnamese are believed to be
two percent of the total illegal immigrant population.  Poles report that it
only costs a few hundred dollars to illegally cross the German-Polish border.

<tt>The UK is considering following the lead of the Netherlands, Germany,
Norway and Spain and detaining applicants for asylum in obsolete military
installations.  Asylum applicants currently get housing and food benefits of
about L100 per week($160).  Instead of cash payments, in the future they would
be provided these benefits in the camps.</tt><p>
<tt>It is hoped that the camps will save money and deter illegal immigration,
since some applicants currently disappear into the UK.   The UK may imitate
France and declare asylum camps to be extra-territorial in order to limit the
appeal rights of residents.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a record 32,821 asylum applications in the UK in 1994, and there
is a backlog of 55,000 applications.  About 90 percent of asylum applications
are rejected after an average 32 weeks.</tt><p>
<tt>The UK is also considering tightening rules on marriages to persons seeking
to immigrate. So-called marriages of convenience can be arranged for L1,000
despite rules that make foreigners who enter the UK to join spouses
probationary immigrants for 12 months.  Some immigration officials report that
spouses interviewed sometimes have trouble remembering and pronouncing each
others' names.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, there were that 19,000 immigrants admitted to the UK as a wife,
husband or fianc&eacute;(e).  Another 17,000 came to Britain for some other
reason, and then announced plans to marry.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain's first Asian Bishop, who was born in Pakistan, urged the UK to
open itself to immigration to attract needed skills.  The Bishop urged the UK
to follow the lead of the US and Canada and plan for the annual admission of
family and economically-useful immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 1,700 aliens were detected attempting to enter the UK clandestinely in
1994.  Police in Scotland in mid-June raided homes and workplaces in their
search for an estimated 4,000 mostly Asian illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Also in June, youths went on a rampage in Manningham, breaking shop
windows.  This prompted a round of soul-searching that concluded that the Asian
Muslim working class has been left behind by economic growth, and is
increasingly frustrated.</tt><p>
<tt>Two police officers accused of killing an illegal Jamaican who was being
forcibly returned to Jamaica in July 1993 were cleared in June 1995.  The
20-year old woman arrived in Britain on a tourist visa to visit her mother, and
then married a 57-year old man whom she reportedly beat.  He had her barred
from his home after 10 weeks, which made her an illegal immigrant in the UK.
After failing to leave as required by several deportation orders, she was
picked up by British police.  There were many editorials in British papers
condemning the verdict and calling for better treatment of immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>A UK quarry hired 12 French workers when, despite 16,480 unemployed workers
in Northleach, no British workers applied for the L4($6.50) per hour jobs.
British employers complain of "a mismatch between what people expect and what
is available."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Russian</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>s
Top Europe's Migrants</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A new report by the UN's Economic Commission for Europe found that Russians
top the list of recently displaced persons and migrants.  The report says that
although the number of refugees, displaced persons and other victims of
military conflicts in Europe as a whole has dropped, in Russia the inflow of
immigrants in the second half of last year rose by 39 per cent.  </tt><p>
<tt>The overall increase in the Russian population in 1994 was 810,000, nearly
double 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The report cites armed conflicts as one of the reasons behind high levels
of population mobility in the former USSR.  Other contributing factors are the
change in the status of a large number of ethnic Slavs in non-Slav countries,
where they are subjected to discrimination, the continuing economic crisis, and
varying standards of living in the countries of the former USSR.</tt><p>
<tt>Non-Estonians who wish to live in Estonia must apply for a residence permit
by July 12, 1995, and as of early June, about 60 percent or 238,000 mostly
Russians had applied.</tt><p>
<tt>About 650,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union have arrived in Israel
since September 1989.  It is reported that hundreds of people in the ex-USSR
are purchasing documents that enable them to pass themselves off as Jews and
win the right to emigrate to Israel.  The going price for such documents is
reportedly $800 per person.</tt><p>
<tt>Former Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon in a June 23 editorial, called
on Israelis not to create a separate Russian party in Israel, because it will
not improve the situation of Russian immigrants in Israel.  Sharon said the
country is too focused on the Arab issue to make aliya a priority.</tt><p>

Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Smugglers are increasingly abandoning Africans and Asians who have paid
$1,000 or more to be smuggled to Western Europe in Eastern Europe.  In several
cases, aliens were told that they were in Italy, when they were actually in
Croatia, or told they were in Germany but were actually in Hungary.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Asian restaurants established by ex-guest workers have become
smuggling fronts.  In Prague, one Chinese restaurant in Prague reportedly has
800 employees and eight tables.</tt><p>
<tt>Aliens sometimes try to enter a country as members or sponsors of sports
teams.  The International Center for Migration Policy Development in Vienna
calculated that alien smugglers in Europe grossed between $100 million and $1.1
billion in 1993; other estimates put annual receipts at $7 billion
annually.</tt><p>
<tt>When these aliens apply for asylum, most are housed in camps in Eastern
Europe that are often run with EU aid.  Some 20,000 aliens have passed through
the Kistarcsa camp outside Budapest since 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>EU aid funds can be used to fight drug smuggling, but not migrant
smuggling.  The major control device developed by western European governments
are bilateral agreements with the countries of transit that require aliens
transiting through e.g. Poland to Germany to be returned to Poland.  Some human
rights groups argue that Eastern European governments do not have the
infrastructure to accurately determine who is a refugee.</tt><p>
<tt>The International Organization of Migration (IOM) reported June 16 that
young women from eastern and central European are migrating to western Europe
in large numbers as prostitutes, that prosecution of smugglers and pimps
sentences was difficult, and that sentences for those convicted were light.
The four major countries of origin for these prostitutes are the Czech Republic
and Poland, while Russia and Ukraine.</tt><p>
<tt>There were a net 1.2 million immigrants arriving in the 15 EU counties in
1992, primarily from the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, Poland and
Romania.  </tt><p>
<tt>Concerned with the influx of immigrants from its southern flank, the
European Union agreed on June 27 to spend $6.1 billion over the next five years
to stabilize the economies of the EU's southern neighbors.  EU leaders also
called for more progress in negotiating trade agreements with Morocco, Israel,
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. </tt><p>
<tt>France has used its six month's as the EU's rotating president to bring
Mediterranean issues to forefront.  Spain takes over the EU presidency on July
1 and is expected to continue pushing for firm links with its Mediterranean

<tt>Turkey is attracting immigrants from the Middle East, North Africa, the
former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland.
Official data put the number of foreign residents in Turkey at 72,905. </tt><p>
<tt>A study by the Center for Turkish Studies in Essen, found that while
official data indicate that 1,861 Iraqi and 4,234 Iranian migrants were
registered as immigrants in Turkey since the Iran-Iraq war in 1991,  there are
5,000 Iraqis in Istanbul alone, and over 200,000 Iranians in Turkey.  Official
data indicate 68 Algerian residents in Turkey but, in 1994 some 22,000
Algerians entered Turkey as tourists, and only 21,000 were recorded as having
left the country.</tt><p>
<tt>United Nations agencies put the numbers of Bosnian migrants in Turkey
following the disintegration of Yugoslavia at 15,000, and the number of
Abkhazians escaping civil war in Georgia at 30,000.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey does not impose visa restrictions on Romanians, Croatians, Albanians
and Macedonians.  Other former East Bloc nationals enter the country on
three-month tourist visas; some stay on to seek employment, often illegally.
</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey, the fastest growing member of the OECD in the mid-1980s, is
floundering economically.  Exports totaled $41 billion in 1994, excluding an
estimated $4 billion in "unofficial" Turkish exports to the ex-USSR that are
carried by women who engage in "luggage trade," arriving in Istanbul with
suitcases stuffed with cheap Russian goods, and leaving with textile and
leather goods from Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey has been trying for a decade to be welcomed into the European Union,
but its human rights record may prevent EU approval of a customs union
scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 1996.  The European Parliament has
threatened to withhold its approval of the customs union unless Turkey's human
rights record improves by October 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Article 8 of Turkey's anti-terrorism law forbids any verbal or written
threats to Turkey's territorial integrity.  This law is used to prosecute
Turkish separatists and their sympathizers, and those charged are tried in
semi-military courts.</tt><p>

<tt>Some of the 40,000 Vietnamese boat people who are still in camps in Hong
Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia are rioting to protest plans to return
them by force if necessary to Vietnam in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US has endorsed the Comprehensive Plan of Action, the plan to return
the Vietnamese, but Republicans in Congress introduced legislation in the
Foreign Aid bill to stop forced returns and to offer up $30 million to 20,000
of the Vietnamese in the camps visas to enter the US.  The House approved the
bill on June 8.  The Senate has not acted upon the bill and President Clinton
has announced his opposition to the measure.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The UNHCR and Asian governments say that the House action is
responsible for the refusal of Vietnamese to return voluntarily.  Some
Vietnamese told refugee counselors that they did not want to return to Vietnam
and would await the final outcome of the US legislation.  The US sent leaflets
distributed to the refugees in Hong Kong and other Asian countries by the UNHCR
to urge them to return home.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian and United Nations officials have halted talks about the 4,000
refugees who refuse to return to Vietnam.  On June 5, more than 4,000
Vietnamese refugees, some armed with knives and sticks, tore down a section of
the fence that surrounds the Sungai Besi transit camp on the outskirts of the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.  The refugees crossed a major highway to
protest their repatriation following Malaysia's decision to close the camp by
Aug. 31.  There has been some discussion by Malaysian government officials of
keeping the camp open past the August deadline for mandatory repatriation.
</tt><p>
<tt>On June 8, police used tear gas to stop an eight-hour protest by Vietnamese
refugees at the High Island detention center in Hong Kong.  The violence
started when police tried to move 94 Vietnamese from the center to another site
prior to repatriation. </tt><p>
<tt>In the aftermath of the riots, the Hong Kong government put on hold the
removal of any Vietnamese from detention centers while it reconsiders its
repatriation policy.  Plans to move 100 people from the High Island camp in
late June have been canceled until at least the end of July. </tt><p>
<tt>Nearly 1,000 Vietnamese have been returned voluntarily from Hong Kong so
far this year. There are still about 500 migrants still in detention centers
who refuse to be repatriated to Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese asylum-seekers stormed a West Australian detention center, injuring
four security officers, on June 11.  The reason for the fighting was unclear,
but seemed to center around two boat people who arrived in Australia in the
same boat. </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam has exported 14,000 workers since the first 811 workers were sent
abroad in 1992, according to the Labor Ministry.  The major countries of
employment for Vietnamese guest workers are South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan,
Malaysia, Lebanon and Libya.  These data exclude the guest workers sent to
Eastern Europe before 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam is hoping to increase its labor exports; 37 of Vietnam's state
enterprises are authorized to send their workers overseas.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Philippine</a>s
Approves New Migrant Worker
Act</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On June 7, Philippines President Fidel Ramos signed into law the Migrant
Workers and Overseas Act.  The new law calls for stricter monitoring of the
policies of labor importing countries to ensure that they have adequate laws to
protect migrant workers.  The bill also tightens regulations on the recruitment
of labor in the Philippines and requires workers to register with Philippine
embassies overseas.</tt><p>
<tt>It is not clear how effective the new law will be.  Nearly half of the
estimated 4 million Philippines' overseas workers are illegal, since they leave
for overseas jobs without the proper documentation.  Many may fail to register
with Filipino authorities abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine Labor Department has begun to station agents at Manila's
airport to detect Filipino workers who are attempting to go abroad illegally
for employment.  Many Filipinos go as tourists to third-country destinations,
and then travel to the country in which they hope to work.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related action, the Philippine Senate ratified the UN Convention on
Migrant Workers.  The Philippines signed the convention in 1993, and completed
the ratification process the last week of May, 1995.  Sixteen more countries
need to ratify the convention before it comes into force. </tt><p>
<tt>An advisory commission appointed by President Ramos after a Filipina maid
was hanged by Singapore in March (April MN) recommended that the Philippines
stop the export of maids to "certain Middle Eastern and Asian nations." The
commission is now on a 15-nation tour to investigate the problems of Philippine
overseas workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, an estimated 5,000 Filipina maids left the Gulf states complaining
of employer abuse. The commission asked the government to start blacklisting
employers who mistreat overseas workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine Overseas Workers Welfare Administration reported receiving
more than 10,000 complaints from overseas workers last year, including 156
cases of physical mistreatment and 18 rapes in Kuwait, 32 physical abuse cases
and 11 rapes in Saudi Arabia and 33 cases of mistreatment and six rapes in
Oman.</tt><p>
<tt>Since April 1995, state-owned Kuwaiti airlines returned at no charge
Filipina maids who charge that they were abused by their Kuwaiti employers.
There are about 20,000 Filipina maids in Kuwait, and 20 left in April, 54 in
early June, and 44 in late June.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated four million Filipinos working abroad, including
perhaps 800,000 women, and 600,000 in the Gulf states.</tt><p>
<tt>With the government discouraging overseas workers, remittances from
overseas workers, a major boost to the economy, are expected to decline.  The
Philippine government hopes to offset the decline in remittances with foreign
investment in the Philippines.  A Philippine political strategist predicts that
it will take three to five years for a shift in the labor deployment rate to be
evident. </tt><p>
<tt>Data showed that during the years when the Philippine economy was
experiencing a downturn, income from migrant workers kept the country's economy
afloat.  Income from abroad increased by 16 per cent, from 7.1 billion pesos in
the first quarter of 1994, to 8.2 billion pesos in early 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines has launched an amnesty program for illegal aliens who
entered the country before June 20, 1992.  Under the program, illegal aliens
can pay about $10,000 and receive a permanent resident status.  The Philippines
hopes to earn $39 million from the legalization program, suggesting that 40
percent of the estimated 100,000 illegal aliens in the country will legalize
their status.  Most of the first applicants have been from China and
Taiwan.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Countries
Lure Hong </a></a></a></a></a></a>Kong Migrants</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Singapore and Taiwan are trying to lure Hong Kong residents who want to
leave the territory prior to 1997.  </tt><p>
<tt>Singapore is running a series of commercials in Hong Kong that show happy
young families enjoying the tropical oasis.  The series is designed to  attract
wealthy Hong Kong residents to the Singapore.  The Singapore government is
confident that its strong educational system will attract Hong Kong residents.
</tt><p>
<tt>There is speculation that Singapore would like the Hong Kong residents to
settle in Singapore because its own affluent and well-educated Chinese
population is having fewer children. Singapore has almost no unemployment.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some Hong Kong residents are reluctant to settle in a city-state considered
dull and tough on law and order.  Of the 40,000 immigration applications
accepted by the Singapore government, only 6,500 have taken up residency in
Singapore. </tt><p>
<tt>Singapore allows qualified Hong Kongers to wait five years before they must
physically migrate, which may account for the low residency rate.  The
government also offers residency to the parents of Hong Kong students studying
in Singapore.</tt><p>
<tt>In a bid to attract more Hong Kong investors prior to 1997, Taiwan has
relaxed its immigration restrictions, reducing in half the required investment
rate.  Ronald Skeldon, a Hong Kong University geography professor, says that
Hong Kong residents prefer Canada to Taiwan.  </tt><p>
<tt>Between 1,000 to 3,500 Hong Kong people settle in Taiwan each year, many
applying on the basis of family reunification. </tt><p>
<tt>Many Hong Kong residents are applying to migrate to several countries, such
as the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, in addition to Singapore and
Taiwan.  Because these Hong Kong migrants are well-off, they will see which
countries accept them before making a decision.  Canada continues to be the
favorite destination, with more than 40,000 new arrivals from Hong Kong.
</tt><p>
<tt>Australia reports that the number of Hong Kong-born people in the country
doubled between 1985 and 1991.  Australia is now has the second largest source
of Hong Kong emigrants, after Britain.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to a 1991 census, of the 278,000 people who left Hong Kong for
Canada, the United States and Australia between 1985 and 1991, more than a
quarter settled in Australia.  There were 57,510 Hong Kong-born residents in
Australia at the time of the 1991 Census, up from 28,293 in 1986 and 15,717 in
1981.</tt><p>

<tt>A labor summit on June 6 in Hong Kong with government officials, employers,
labor leaders and legislators was unable to agree upon the issue of labor
importation into the territory.  Governor Chris Patten said that there are
sharp differences on how the hiring of foreign workers affects the unemployment
rate in Hong Kong.  He is considering establishing a tripartite committee with
representatives of government, employers and labor to manage the labor
importation plan which is now run solely by the government.  </tt><p>
<tt>A 13-point plan was presented during the summit which included stepping up
retraining, doubling the immigration task force to 100 to deal with illegal
immigrants, and stiffer action against illegal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment issue has united the pro-Beijing and liberal camps here,
which organized signature campaigns as well as a noisy mass protest outside the
government building where the summit was held.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong currently allows a maximum of 25,000 semi-skilled foreign workers
into the territory at any time.  This excludes the 120,000 foreign domestic
workers, and thousands of foreign construction workers at the Chek Lap Kok
airport site. </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's unemployment rate jumped to a nine-year high of three percent
in the second quarter of 1995, prompting union leaders to press for an end to
the employment of foreign workers. The government says the actual number of
imported workers is less than one-third the number of unemployed locals.  An
estimated 78,000 Hong Kong residents were unemployed in the first quarter of
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong has quotas for various types of foreign workers:  foreign
professionals are not restricted by quota, but there is a limit of 25,000
semi-skilled workers, and 17,000 construction workers.  In addition, there are
about 120,000 domestic foreign workers in Hong Kong.  Unions claim that, with
illegal workers, there are a total of 300,000 foreign workers in Hong
Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1989, Hong Kong upped the foreign worker quotas to keep the territory
competitive, but so many factory jobs have moved to southwestern China that
unemployment among garment and other manufacturing workers is reported to be
almost 10 percent.  Hong Kong employers have permitted workers imported for one
purpose, for example as maids and gardeners, are being used in other jobs, as
drivers or street sales persons, or even factory workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Patten announced that illegal foreign workers will be the target of 92
inspectors of the Immigration Department in order to create jobs for unemployed
local workers.  During the first 24-hour period on June 16-17, 88 illegal
immigrants were arrested during a territory-wide sweep. </tt><p>
<tt>Illegal foreign workers can be fined $5,000 and jailed for two years.  In
1994, 919 Hong Kong employers, and 2,906 foreign workers, were fined.
Increased employer penalties are expected to be announced by the government
this year. </tt><p>
<tt>The daily quota for the number of Chinese allowed to immigrate to Hong Kong
will be raised on July 1, 1995 from 105 to 150.  Most of the additional
immigration slots are reserved for children who are not of school age, i.e.,
those less than five and 16 to 21, to minimize pressures on Hong Kong
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>After July 1, 1997, a Chinese person born outside Hong Kong can reside in
Hong Kong if one of his or her parents was a Hong Kong resident at birth.

<tt>There are an estimated 300,000 illegal migrant workers in Japan, prompting
a study of how to provide them with health care.  A panel convened by the
Ministry of Health and Welfare recommended that employers and permanent foreign
workers share the cost of health insurance premiums on a 50-50 basis, but did
not say exactly how illegal workers would be covered.  This is a policy shift
for the Health and Welfare Ministry, who had previously insisted that health
insurance coverage for illegal workers would encourage them to stay. </tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese Supreme Court asked lower courts to translate written
indictments for foreign defendants into languages they can understand.  The
court hopes that this will help protect the human rights of foreign criminal
defendants, who are increasing in number.  Foreigners are 4 percent of those
arrested for criminal offenses. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, over 65,000 foreigners were deported from Japan, a seven percent
decrease over 1993.  The Japanese government attributed the decline to a
recession and tighter control over illegal workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Of the 59,352 foreigners found to be working illegally in 1994, 17,130 were
South Korean, followed by nationals of Thailand, Malaysia, China, Iran and
other Southeast Asian countries.  Illegal workers from China, Peru and Burma
rose most sharply.  The most common type of jobs held by illegal workers were
construction, factory or entertainment. </tt><p>

<tt>There are estimated to be 80 to 100 million migrant workers within China,
and the disruptions associated with migration are showing up in broken families
and rising crime.  Migrants living under bridges sometimes rob local residents,
and are victims of robbery.  </tt><p>
<tt>Police who arrest migrants for vagrancy know that many will be sentenced to
produce goods for three to six months in prison factories.  The Chinese
government is considering holding a national conference on its new efforts to
manage migrant laborers.</tt><p>
<tt>The "floating population," as the Chinese government refers to migrants,
has affected economic development and social stability.  According to a
government spokesperson, the Chinese plan to strengthen registration and public
security control. </tt><p>
<tt>The increased number of rural Chinese migrants, many of whom belong to
minority groups, has heightened awareness of their cultural differences and
economic disadvantages.  The government has launched an affirmative action
plan: exempting minorities from the strictures of the one-child birth control
policy and allowing them to have three or more children, opening up new
educational opportunities for them and providing better access to government
jobs.  Between 1982 and 1990, the minority population grew by more than 35
percent to 91.2 million. </tt><p>
<tt>Guandong Province has emerged as a safe haven for people fleeing poverty
and forced birth control of the Jiangxi Province.  Migrants often live on boats
to evade census registration, with three or four children earning a living
fishing.  In northern Hunan, local government officials have started posting
warnings that boat people on Dongting Lake must report four times per year to
local clinics for pregnancy checks or face steep fines. </tt><p>
<tt>These internal Chinese boat people tell stories of those found without
census or marriage cards having their boats destroyed or confiscated.  Others
tell of family planning officials threatening to blow up houses if the women
did not submit to sterilization.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 13, the Chinese government announced that it would reinforce its
controls to halt illegal immigration, especially into the southern regions of
the country.  More than 20,000 foreigners enter China illegally every year,
mostly from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, plus a small number of illegal
immigrants from Africa and Russia.  In the past year, police detained 12,000
illegal immigrants in the Yunnan province and the autonomous region of Guangxi.

<tt>Malaysia's Human Resources Ministry in June outlined strategies to increase
the supply of local workers and to reduce dependence on foreign workers.
</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia has an unemployment rate of less than three percent, and a recent
poll of 150 local, foreign and joint-venture companies reported that 62 percent
of the foreign firms in Malaysia face labor shortages, but only 28 percent
considered the problem serious.  One-third of the foreign and joint-venture
companies might shift some of their operations to other countries if labor
shortages continue.</tt><p>
<tt>Thirty-three percent of the companies in the manufacturing sector indicated
a need for the government to play a greater role in upgrading training,
productivity and setting up vocational institutes, and 28 per cent wanted a
relaxation of the restrictions governing the importation of foreign
labor.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the electrical and electronics foreign firms in Malaysia recommend
that the government legalize illegal foreign workers in the country to
alleviate the labor shortage.  </tt><p>
<tt>When the government recently raided Bangladeshi housing areas, there were
reported to be shortages of gas station attendants.  Tighter restrictions on
Indonesian migration reportedly led to farm labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>There are reportedly 850,000 legal foreign workers in Malaysia, including
100,000 maids, and 400,000 illegal foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Instead of hiring more foreign workers, Malaysia would like to raise the 47
percent female labor force participation rate, to increase the number of part
time jobs, and to make unemployed workers in depressed regions more mobile, so
that they could move to where jobs are.  In addition, the Malaysian
government's Seventh Plan (1996-2000) provides M$1 billion to build seven more
training centers which are expected to add 10,000 skilled workers
annually.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian trade unions note that several hundred thousand Malaysians
migrate overseas for jobs, and that the solution to the labor shortage is to
raise wages.  In southern Malaysia, Malaysians commute to jobs in Singapore,
while foreign workers fill in behind them in Malaysia.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers who change jobs in Malaysia can be charged up to $US122,
while employers who hire illegal foreign workers can be fined up to $US 4,098,
plus face five years imprisonment.  Some foreigners reportedly enter Malaysia
as maids, and then go to work in higher-wage restaurants, grocery stores, and
offices.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia and the Philippines agreed to develop an identification system for
legal Filipino workers.  The Philippine government estimates that there are
four to six million Filipinos in 130 countries, and new laws grant these
overseas Filipinos new tax exemptions and protections.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine government asked Malaysia to grant partial amnesty for its
illegal workers in the country so that they could be properly registered.  The
Philippine government said it will welcome back any illegal workers who wish to
return home. </tt><p>
<tt>The Maybank of Malaysia, Philippine National Bank and Indonesia's Lippobank
have implemented a joint electronic remittance system.  The system enables
Indonesian workers in Malaysia to remit money for a $4 fee at any of the
Maybank branches, to be collected at any Lippobank branch in Indonesia. </tt><p>
<tt>The three banks hope that the new system will funnel the money away from
unregulated couriers, who sometimes charge high fees and use arbitrary exchange
rates. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Australia
Raises Immigrant Quota</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Australia announced an increase of 6,500 for FY 95-96 in the family and
skills categories. They is also an increase of 500 for business migrants and
3,000 in the special category for Chinese nationals who were allowed to stay in
Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre. </tt><p>
<tt>The immigration minister had asked the Australian Cabinet for an increase
of 10,000 immigrants, but was turned down of because of the potential impacts
on the labor market.  According the immigration minister, the increase in
business migrants reflects the "internationalization of the economy," and
Australia's needs to take advantage of resources, skills and networks of
business migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The government will plan to accept 83,000 migrants in 1995-96 compared with
76,500 places in FY 94-95.  The increase is restricted to the family reunion
(51,000 in total), skilled migration (30,800) and special eligibility (1200)
categories.  There will be no increase in 1994's 13,000 slots for
refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>A Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research report says
that the number of new immigrants to Sydney has jumped from 38 percent of the
total intake in 1984-85 to 44 percent in 1993-94.  The next most popular
destination for new immigrants in Victoria, with 23 percent of new arrivals.
Up to half of the immigrants who arrived in Sydney were not in the workforce in
1993-94; of those eligible to work, 11 percent did not have a job. </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government has raised the visa application fees from A$400
to $550, and from A$1,715 to $2,430 for business migrants.  This will earn the
government an extra A$13 million.  The government also approved an increase in
spending for migrant services of $40 million. </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian Opposition claim that the government has "unleashed an
unprecedented attack" on migrant communities.  The opposition claims the
government does not provide equitable access to services for ethnic
communities, and that cuts in health and education have augmented the problems.
</tt><p>
<tt>An Opposition White Paper further claims that Australia's industrial
relations policies leave immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation.  The
opposition called on the ethnic communities to comment on the paper by August
18, so that a new policy could be considered at the ALP state conference in

<tt>There are believed to be 55 million child laborers in India today, and a
projected 70 million in the year 2000.  The ILO estimates that there are 200
million children ages 10 to 14 employed world wide, making children almost 10
percent of the world's 2.5 billion workers.</tt><p>
<tt>One reason why the number of children working in carpet, match, and other
factories in India is expected to increase is because India recently changed
economic policies to stress exports.  The largest single employer of children
in India is agriculture, where an estimated 25 million are employed, and the
second largest employer of Indian children are services that range from hotels
to household maids.  But there are also believed to be over five million Indian
children employed in labor intensive industries that range from carpet weaving
to cutting gems to making soccer balls.  </tt><p>
<tt>Families in areas such as Bihar, where incomes average less than $100
annually and seasonal migration to stone quarries and brick kilns is common,
sending children to make carpets in the shade is considered better by some
families than to have them crushing rocks in the sun.  In response to action
against child labor, carpet makers have begun to use subcontractors to produce
carpets in remote villages.  The Indian government's Rugmark program, which
certifies that children were not employed to make carpets, has three inspectors
to keep children away from looms in 2,000 villages, many inaccessible by
auto.</tt><p>
<tt>Child labor, and migrant child labor, raises questions about how far
governments and international organizations should go to intervene in
situations in which families look to children to provide up to one-third of
family income.</tt><p>
<tt>The Indian Commission on Labour Standards concluded that industrialized
countries should help fund the cost of eliminating child labor by the year
2000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Nepal will begin penalizing carpet weavers who employ children by asking
western carpet-importing countries to deny them tariff concessions.  The
Nepalese government's decision was in part a response to the falling sales of
carpets after Western buyers stopped purchasing products made by companies who
employ children. </tt><p>
<tt>Bangladesh, on the other hand, condemned reports by the Washington,
DC-based Child Labor Coalition that Bangladesh garment manufacturers employ
children.  The Bangladesh government plans to send a high-level delegation to
the US to detail the measures the garment makers have taken to eliminate child
labor from the industry.  </tt><p>
<tt>In response, the CLC has agreed to suspend a boycott against Bangladesh, so
that new negotiations can begin between the garment makers and the exporters
association.  Negotiations between the US, United Nations, exporters
association, and CLC resumed in June. </tt><p>
<tt>The US and France want to put labor standards, including child labor, on
the agenda of the World Trade Organization.  Germany has agreed with India that
non-trade issues, such as child labor, should not be raised that the WTO.
