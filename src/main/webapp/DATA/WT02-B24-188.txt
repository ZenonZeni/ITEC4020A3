<H3><CENTER>A LOVE LETTER</CENTER>
</H3>
<B>Dear Julia,</B>
<P>By now, you know me pretty well. And you know that I can write on
just about any subject. But I feel as though there are no words to express
what you have done for me and Gregory. Jamie is a miracle if ever there was
one. He is the baby of my heart. The one I've always wanted and imagined.
But, he wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
<P>One year ago, I couldn't even look at a pregnant woman without feeling
pain. I couldn't look into the window of a nursery furniture store or a baby
clothiers store without wondering what I could have done to deserve such
punishment.
<P>Every time there was a story about an infant abandoned or abused, I wanted
to take that child and make it my own. I couldn't understand why someone
who had been so blessed could abuse that privilege.
<P>Now, after eight years of waiting, I am actually somebody's mommy. You
can't imagine what it feels like to write those words. Every little thing
Jamie does is so precious to me.
<P>You gave what so few have the power to give. Not just an egg and a uterus.
The care and concern for others to make being a surrogate mother worthwhile.
How many people have the ability to make someone else's dream come true?
That's just what you've been able to do. And you've done it with such openness,
such selflessness, such pride. I hope that Jamie will inherit a little of
that from you.
<P>Julia, I hope that you realize that with your strength, and your positive
attitude, you can do anything you set your mind to. I hope this experience
has proven that to you.
<P>Soon, you will start a new life in Idaho. I know that you and Ken will
make it a fantastic success. I see your children, Alex and Seth, growing
up in an atmosphere of wonderful values and plenty of love. They can't help
but be successes, too.
<P>I know, too, that we will not continue to be as close as we've been. And
that's probably only natural. But understand that I will be thinking of you.
Jamie will know who you are as soon as he is old enough to understand. And
he will be taught to love and respect you. Of course we'll keep in touch
and keep you informed of his progress. And I hope you will let me know what
is new and exciting in your life, too.
<P>It's obvious how many people in your life think you are terrific and special.
But, with the exception of Ken and the boys, no one will really know the
full extent of what you have done the way Gregory and I do.
<P>I don't know if I could feel any closer to you. Not if we were sisters.
You've changed my life for the better and in the process I can see the positive
things you've done for yourself.
<P>No matter what else happens in the rest of your life, you have already
done more to prove you are a caring person than most people will ever be
able to do. And I have the baby to prove it.
<P>I love you, Julia. And, I always will.
<P>
