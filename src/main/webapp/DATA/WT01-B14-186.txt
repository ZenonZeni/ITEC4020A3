<H2> ID CARDS: SOME PERSONAL VIEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD</H2><p><br><br>

<P>


In 1994, in an attempt to discover the problems caused by ID cards, Privacy
 International compiled a survey containing reports from correspondents in forty
 countries.  Amongst the gravest of problems reported to Privacy International was
 the over zealous use or misuse of ID cards by police - even where the cards were
 supposed to be voluntary. One respondent wrote :<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On one occasion I was stopped in Switzerland when walking at night near Lake Geneva.
  I was living in Switzerland at the time and had a Swiss foreigner's ID card.  The
 police were wondering why I should want to walk at night to look at the Chateau de
 Chillon.  Really suspicious I suppose, to walk at night on the banks of the lake to
 look at an illuminated chateau (I am white and dress conservatively).  I had to
 wait for 20 minutes whilst they radioed my ID number to their central computer to
 check on its validity.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>



Correspondents in most countries reported that police had powers to demand the ID
 card. A correspondent in Greece reported:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>In my country the Cards are compulsory.  If police for example stop you and ask  for
 identification you must present them the ID or you are taken to the police
 department for identification research.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Police were granted these powers in the late 1980s, despite some public misgivings.
 Non European countries reported more serious transgressions, In Brazil, for example:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>They are compulsory, you're in big trouble with the police if they request it and
 you don't have one or left home without it. The police can ask for my identity card
 with or without a valid motive, it's an intimidation act that happens in Brazil
 very, very often.  The problem is not confined to the police.  Everybody asks for
 your id when you are for example shopping, and this is after you have shown your
 cheque guarantee card. We also other similar cards. Nobody trusts anybody
 basically.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

Predictably, political hot-spots have seen widescale abuse of the card system:<p>



<BLOCKQUOTE>One problem that Afghans encountered carrying these "tazkiras"  (ID cards) was
 during the rule of the communist regime in Afghanistan  where people were stopped
 in odd hours and in odd places by the government's Soviet advisors and their KHALQI
 and PARCHAMI agents and asked for their "tazkiras". Showing or not showing the
 "tazkira" to the enquiring person at that time was followed by grave consequences.
 By showing it, the bearer would have revealed his age upon which, if it fell
 between 16-45, he would have been immediately taken to the nearest army post and
 drafted into the communist army, and if he refused to show, he would have been
 taken to the nearest secret service (KHAD) station and interrogated as a member of
 the resistance (Mujahideen), imprisoned, drafted in the army or possibly killed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Many countries reported that their ID card had become an internal passport, being
 required for every dealing with people or institutions. In Argentina, according to
 this correspondent, the loss of the ID card would result in grave consequences:<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I got my first personal ID when I turned seven. It was the Provincial Identity Card.
 It looked like the hardcover of a little book with just two pages in it. It had my
 name, my photograph, the fingerprint of my right thumb, and some other personal
 data. I never questioned what was the logic about fingerprinting a seven-year old
 boy. It was suggested that identification was one of the major purposes for the
 existence of the Police of the Province which issued the card. It was required for
 enroling in the Provincial School I attended. Attending the primary school is
 compulsory, hence everybody under twelve is indirectly forced to have the
 Card.Well, this Book was required for any sort of proceedings that the person
 wanted to initiate, e.g. enrol at school, buy a car, get his driving license, get
 married. Nobody could do anything without it. In addition, it became a  prerogative
 of the police to request it at any time and place. Whoever was caught without it
 was customarily taken to jail and kept there for several hours (or overnight if it
 happened in the evening) while they "checked his personal record".  In effect,
 Argentine citizens have never been much better off than South-African negroes
 during the Apartheid, the only difference is that we Argentinians did not have to
 suffer lashings if caught without the pass card.  As for daily life without the ID,
 it was impossible. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Of greater significance is the information that ID cards are commonly used as a
 means of tracking citizens to ensure compliance with such laws as military service.
 Again, in Argentina: <P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
The outrage of the military  service was something that many people was not ready to
 put up with. Nevertheless, something forced the people to present themselves to be
 drafted. It was nothing more or less than the ID.  In fact, if somebody did not
 show up, the army never bothered to look for them. They just waited for them to
 fall by themselves, because the ID card showed the boy to be on military age and
 not having the necessary discharge records by the army. Provided that in the
 country you could not even go for a walk without risking to be detained by the
 police, being a no-show for military duty amounted to a civil death.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Another respondent in Singapore noted that many people in his country were aware
 that the card was used for purposes of tracking their movements, but that most did
 not see any harm in this:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If that question is put to Singaporeans, they are unlikely to say that the cards
 have been abused. However, I find certain aspects of the NRIC (ID card) system
 disconcerting. When I finish military service (part of National service), I was
 placed in the army reserve. When I was recalled for reserve service, I found that
 the army actually knew about my occupation and salary! I interpreted this as an
 intrusion into my privacy. It might not be obvious but the NRIC system has made it
 possible to link fragmented information together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>


The consequences of losing ones card were frequently mentioned:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>A holiday in Rio was ruined for me when I was robbed on the beach and had to spend
 the rest of the brief holiday going through the bureaucracy to get a duplicate
 issued. One way round this (of dubious legality) is to walk around with a notarized
 xerox copy instead of the original. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


The Brazillian experience shows that the card is often misused by police:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Of course violent police in metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro love
 to beat and arrest people (especially black/poor) on the pretext that they don't
 have their ID card with them. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In some countries, denial of a card means denial of virtually all services:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>ID cards are very important in Vietnam.  They differentiate between citizens and
 non-citizens.  People without an ID card are considered as being denied of
 citizenship and all the rights that come with it.  For example, they cannot get
 legal employment, they cannot get a business license, they cannot go to school,
 they cannot join official organizations, and of course they cannot join the
 communist party.   They cannot travel either. (Even though in practice, they bribe
 their way around within the country, they would face big trouble if got caught
 without ID card.)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>



The same problem occurs in China:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>I personally feel that the card has the following drawbacks:   It carries too much
 private info about a person.  We have to use it in almost every situation. such as
 renting a hotel room, getting legal service from lawyers, contacting government
 agencies, buying a plane ticket and train ticket, applying for a job, or getting
 permit to live with your parents,  otherwise your residence is illegal. In a  lot
 of cases, we are showing  too much irrelevant information to an agency or person
 who should not know that.  The card is subject to police cancellation, and thus 
 without it, one can hardly do anything, including traveling for personal or
 business purposes, or getting legal help or obtaining a job. The government has
 been using this scheme too often as a measure against persons who run into troubles
 with it socially or politically.  The identity card is showing your  daily or every
 short-term movement, and can be used to regularize and monitor a person's behavior
 and activity.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


One Korean professor reported that the national card was used primarily as a means
 of tracking peoples activities and movements:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

 If you lose this card, you have to report and make another one within a certain
 period.  Since it shows your current address, if you change your address then you
 must report that and make a correction of the new address.  If you go to a military
 service or to a prison, then the government takes away this identity card. You get
 the card back when you get out.  You are supposed to carry this card everywhere you
 go, since the purpose is to check out the activity of people. There are fines and
 some jail terms if you do not comply.  If you board a ship or an airplane, then you
 must show this card to make a record. You need to show this card when you vote.
 Former presidential candidate Kim, Dae Joong could not vote for his own
 presidential election because his secretary forgot to bring Kim's card. He had to
 wait for a while until somebody bring his card.  Many government employees make lot
 of money selling information on this card to politicians during election season. 
 Police can ask you to show this card and check whether your identity number is on
 the wanted list or not.  There is a widespread prejudice between the people of some
 local areas. This card shows the permanent address of you. And it allows other
 people to successfully guess the hometown of your parents. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>



One Portuguese man studying in the United States reported an obsession with identity  in his country:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
I keep losing my ID. card, and people keep asking for it.  It seems like it's needed
 for just about everything I want to do, and I should really carry it around my neck
 or have it tattooed on my palm.  The information on it is needed for everything.  
 Many buildings, perhaps most, will have a clerk sitting at a "reception desk" who
 will ask you for your id.  They will keep it and give it back to you when you
 leave.  Few people seem bothered with this, but then they don't keep loosing
 they're cards like I do.  SO I usually threw a little tantrum "Are we under curfew?
  Why do I have to carry my id with me anyway?"  Our tolerant culture invariably
 leads the clerk to take whatever other document I happen to be carrying -- usually
 my bus pass, which I loose less often.  After a while I surrender and go get myself
 a new id. card. It takes 1/2 a day or more to do this and -- guess what -- you need
 your old id. card.  It's more complicated if you've lost it.  Then finally I am
 legal again for a while. It's partly due to the Portuguese obsession with identity.
  Everyone carries both they're mother's and father's last names.  
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


Others confirmed the traditional problem of counterfeiting:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE> It costs only 300 rupees ($10) to get a counterfeit ID card. The system hardly
 works. We all know how fake IDs (one guy's photo, another one's name) can be
 obtained so people can have their friends take GREs and TOEFLs (national tests) for
 them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
