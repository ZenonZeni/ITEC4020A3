<h2><font color = "#2f4f2f">PRODUCTS LIABILITY</font></h2>

<font size = 4>

<p>  Over the course of the last two decades, the Firm has been at the forefront of products liability
litigation, successfully defending products manufacturers by fashioning novel and creative defenses to
combat the ever-changing theories of the plaintiffs' bar.  Among the clients we have successfully
defended are: </p>

<dt>

<p><img align = bottom src = "redball.gif"> an automobile manufacturer in numerous alleged defective product recall cases </p>

<p><img align = bottom src = "redball.gif"> a copier manufacturer, a medical device manufacturer and a computer manufacturer against suits by
distributors in cases filed nationwide alleging economic loss as a result of the manufacturers' allegedly
defective products </p>

<p><img align = bottom src = "redball.gif"> an industrial equipment manufacturer in claims by employees of its customers who contended that
they lost limbs as a result of the poor design of the equipment </p>

<p><img align = bottom src = "redball.gif"> a pharmaceutical company against failure to warn and improper labeling claims </p>

<p><img align = bottom src = "redball.gif"> an electric tool manufacturer and electronic components manufacturers against claims that design
deficiencies caused loss of life and injury </p>

<p><h4> The Firm's practice encompasses the broad range of legal representation needed
by clients. </p></h4>
