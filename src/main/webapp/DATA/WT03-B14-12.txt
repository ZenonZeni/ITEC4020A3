A DECADE IN VIDEOTEX COMMUNICATIONS

      With the decade of the 1980s behind us and the dawn of the
1990s on the horizon, the videotex industry is positioned for a
new beginning.  As we look back on an industry that was born 10
years ago, we see that despite a slow start, the concept of
residential electronic messaging services is beginning to come
into vogue.
      To the videotex industry, the 1980s have in many ways been a
paradox--a decade perhaps epitomized best by the old literary
line "it was the best of times--it was the worst of times."
      For those of us who now look back over the past 10 years in
the information services arena to determine the common thread
that ties together the events of that decade, the only constant
appears to have been change.
      As a fitting beginning to the decade of the 1990s, VIEWTEXT
is taking a look back on the major events, visions, and changes
of the past decade and the past year that have brought us to this
point in our industry's history.

Challenges and opportunities

      Riding the sweeping tide of the Information Age, the
consumer videotex industry was born amid much fanfare in 1981.
By the end of the 1980s, some advocates claimed at the time,
every home in America would access information services--
including news and banking--from a terminal in their living room.
As we enter the 1990s, that vision is still far from reality.
      Even by the time of the Videotex '82 conference in July of
that year, the reality of the mammoth challenge of deployment had
become apparent.
      While a number of videotex trials (Time Inc., Knight-
Ridder/AT&T, and Times Mirror) were already under way, questions
on divergent standards, consumer demand, and the service's
relationship to existing media were already being raised.
      These factors, and an insufficient residential terminal
base, had closed the book on those early trials by the late
1980s.  In the last 2 years, however, a proliferation of personal
computers in the home and RBOC gateway involvement has
resurrected the videotex concept.
      One nationwide service, the IBM/Sears joint venture Prodigy,
as well as regional services operated by Southwestern Bell and
BellSouth, Nynex, Bell Atlantic and U S West appear to be gaining
steam and may give American living rooms an intelligent window on
the world in the 1990s.
      Other developments, including ISDN and RBOC installations of
fiber-to-the-home, could also give the industry the push it needs
to realize the vision in this decade.

A new telecommunications infrastructure

      Perhaps the one event that has had the most significant
impact on the  communications marketplace is the 1982 antitrust
settlement that broke up AT&T's telecommunications empire.
      So significant were the events of that time, that the
ripples have not only been felt throughout the 1980s, but
repercussions will likely continue throughout the remainder of
the 20th century.  The AT&T-Justice Department Settlement
Agreement, signed Jan. 8, 1982, by the 2 parties, replaced the
1956 consent decree that had ended a 1949 antitrust action.
      Under the terms of that agreement, AT&T divested its 22 Bell
operating companies (BOCs), which then were required to function
as separate entities independent of AT&T.
      The BOCs, which were grouped into 7 regional holding
companies (RBOCs), retained the local exchange and exchange
access services, but were banned from engaging in manufacturing,
interexchange services, information services, or "any other
product or service, except exchange telecommunications and
exchange access service, that is not a natural monopoly service
actually regulated by tariff."
      For the first time, alternative interexchange carriers such
as MCI would be able to compete on a level playing field.  For
the price of divestiture,  AT&T retained its interexchange
business and all constraints on its dabbling in technology were
lifted--enabling AT&T to realize its dreams of moving into the
computer business.  It was, however, barred from engaging in
electronic publishing services until last year.
      When U.S. District Judge Harold Greene OK'd AT&T's bid to
enter the electronic publishing business last August, he may have
opened the door allowing the long-distance giant to offer content
in a cross-country videotex and audiotext network should it so
decide.
      In addition to freeing AT&T to provide videotex and
audiotext, the decision theoretically will also permit AT&T to
provide electronic messaging services, including E-mail,
nationally via the same transmission facility.
      Greene's decision reversed a clause in the modified final
judgment (MFJ) that for the last 7 years has blocked AT&T from
engaging in the electronic publishing business.  When the MFJ was
issued, the court reasoned that the prohibition was necessary
both because of AT&T's "de facto control of the interexchange
network, coupled with the infancy of the electronic publishing
industry" at that time.
      Greene, who also signed the order that dissected Ma Bell's
empire, would continue to play a critical role in the evolution
of the new telecommunications order throughout the remainder of
the decade.  On March 7, 1988, Greene issued a 66-page order
reversing some of the provisions of the (MFJ).
      That original order permitted the RBOCs to engage in the
transmission of information as part of a gateway to an
information service, but not in the generation or manipulation of
information content.
      Other concessions made to the RBOCs in that order included
the ability to provide electronic mail, voice storage and
retrieval, voice messaging services, and kiosk billing.
      This resulted in the entry of the RBOCs into the electronic
messaging arena in a big way.  Today, most of the RBOCs offer
gateway services and many offer electronic mail services to a
rapidly growing base of corporate clients.
      At the dawn of the 1990s, support continues to build for so-
called "free the RBOCs" proposals, and faced with the need to
address critical issues of global competitiveness and customer
service, the RBOCs appear destined for regulatory relief in the
first half of the new decade.
      Last year was a year of heavy activity for the RBOCs as they
began to stake a claim in the information services marketplace.
The Information Age officially arrived in the Omaha, Neb./Council
Bluffs, Iowa, area in November 1989, when the U S West Community
Link Gateway went on line.
      U S West joined fellow RBOCs BellSouth (the first to enter
this field), Southwestern Bell, Nynex, and Bell Atlantic in the
videotex gateway services market.  By year's end, only Pacific
Bell and Ameritech were still lacking an on-line gateway by which
their customers can gain access to electronic information and
messaging services.

Pacific Bell bows out of the videotex arena

      West Coast information service providers were dealt a severe
blow in November, when Pacific Bell abruptly cancelled its
California Online gateway project, apparently a victim of
Chairman Ginn's budget axe.  This most recent setback for the
videotex industry is reminiscent of Pacific Bell's ill-fated
Project Victoria, an ISDN trial dismantled in the spring of 1988
(VT, June 1988, p. 2).
      Roger Conrad, director of voice information and gateway
services for Pacific Bell, told VIEWTEXT, "We are deferring at
this point."

Customer needs; commercial viability

      At the time, Conrad said, "Products that we are currently
being allowed to introduce into the marketplace will not satisfy
or meet our customers' needs.  Therefore, we have concluded that
it will not be commercially viable for Pacific Bell or the
information providers that would be involved in the trial."
      Pacific Bell disassembled its estimated $1-2 million gateway
project with its 8-10 employees and re-allocated the resources to
its other projects such as voice mail, X.400, and the interactive
voice response service bureau for 976 and 900 providers.

California On-Line trial was scheduled for 1990

      The FCC had conditionally approved Pacific Bell's Comparably
Efficient Interconnection (CEI) plan to offer a videotex gateway
service, "California Online," scheduled for a market trial in the
San Francisco Bay area during the second quarter of 1990.
      Quantum Computer was to develop a user interface for the
gateway, and Vicorp Interactive System to implement the
information storage facility using a Tandem NonStop computer
system.
      Conrad laid the blame on a lack of maturity of the videotex
market which is due to insufficient PC penetration (despite a Bay
Area ubiquity of PCs that ranks among the highest in the nation),
little general public awareness, and not enough on-line
information services out there for companies.
      The project is being "put on hold" until there is
significant market development or deregulation occurs.
Deregulation is considered a very critical factor.  Although
Conrad asserted that competition with IBM/Sears joint venture
Prodigy was not part of the considerations, he did say that
Prodigy has not had the restrictions placed on it that the RBOCs
have had to endure, such as offering preferred access to some
customers, providing their own services or centralizing
operations between LATAs.
      Most of the other RBOCs appear to have acknowledged that
they must commit to the videotex market without expecting profits
in the foreseeable future.  Pacific Bell chose not to wait out
the storm under the conditions that exist today in the regulated
marketplace.

Up-to-date in Omaha with U S West

      U S West customers officially entered the information age in
November when the Community Link trial began in the Omaha, Neb.,
and Council Bluffs, Iowa, (the 2 cities are separated by a river)
metropolitan area.  U S West's marketing communications manager
Ron Dulle said that the RBOC initially targeted 70,000 customers
through a direct-mail campaign.
      Approximately 40 percent of the services on their Community
Link gateway have local applications, including grocery ordering
and delivery, municipal government, local sports, symphony,
community calendar, advertising, and so on.          By year's end, U S
West had 64 contracts with information service providers (ISPs),
Dulle told us, with more being added every week.  Because each
ISP can provide more than one service, the total number of online
services approaches the 150-175 range.
      Customers access the service through modem-equipped personal
computers or through a dumb terminal that can be either rented or
purchased from U S West.  A Community Link Center retail store
will be opened in an Omaha shopping mall, where customers can
obtain the communications devices and software necessary to
access the service.
      Philips Minitel M2 terminals, which support both Teletel and
ASCII formats, can be rented for $7.95 a month, or be purchased
for $295.  Two months free rental or a $50 dollar discount plus
free software were being offered as an introductory inducement to
start up the service.
      Emulation software from Minitel is available for IBM, Apple
II, Macintosh and Commodore, and will be available under the
Community Link label.

Bell Atlantic introduced gateways in Washington and Philadelphia

      In January of 1989, Bell Atlantic kicked off 2 gateway
trials on the East Coast.  Bell of Pennsylvania is targeting
small businesses in the Philadelphia area, while C&P Telephone is
focusing on residential customers in the Washington, D.C., metro
area.  To date, the RBOC has not attracted tremendous numbers of
users.
      The trial will continue in 1990 with more emphasis devoted
to aggressively marketing the service.   Bell Atlantic first
concentrated on enhancing its gateway service by adding 3 new
information providers (IPs) to its gateway trial (VT, May 1989,
p. 3).  Dialcom, American CitiNet Inc. and Minitel USA Inc.
together are providing more than 90 new services to the
Washington Metropolitan area adding electronic mail, tax
information, and travel information.           CitiNet's 47 services
cover a broad spectrum, from an E-mail service, American CitiNet
Mail, weekends on the road, to cultural events up in the New
England area.
      Minitel Services was providing access to an extensive array
of French and English language services by the fourth or fifth of
August, said Joseph Mazzeo, Minitel Services president.  Mazzeo
spoke of a unique French cooking class in English allowing users
to "look in the refrigerator for ingredients" and a Euro-based
database of information by the European Economic Community (EEC).
      Howard Morrison, product manager for Bell Atlantic services,
told us,  "What we learn this year will determine how we roll
this service out to other service areas.  We're looking to expand
already."
      The total number of online services reached 112 this fall,
and included a strong local orientation.  Some of the more recent
offerings include California Wine Online, GEnie, Journal
Graphics, Trademark Register, and a Washington Dating Service.
Bell Atlantic also offers an electronic messaging service that is
provided through the SprintMail (formerly Telemail) network.
      Bell Atlantic's Gateway Service is available to all
Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone residential and business
customers in the Washington metropolitan area on a 24-hour basis
via a modem and a personal computer.
      Bell Atlantic also included Prodigy's videotex services in a
residential trial of integrated services digital network (ISDN)
last summer.  This was the first inclusion on Prodigy in an ISDN
trial since the AT&T ISDN demonstration at NetPower '89.
      Prodigy's computer-based information and electronic shopping
service as well as Bell Atlantic's gateway service was offered
free of charge for the residential trial.  The advantage of using
Prodigy or Bell Atlantic's Gateway service with ISDN is the
access through a plug in a wall vs. the need for a modem, and not
tying up a voice line.
      In December, addressing a gathering of communications
managers, Bell Atlantic CEO Raymond W. Smith blasted a decision
by Judge Greene regarding intra-LATA gateways, the effect of
which requires the RBOCs to maintain separate databases in each
local access transport area (LATA) for its electronic information
gateways (See related story, p. 11).
      The Bell Atlantic CEO said the decision hurts his firm's
gateway by "raising costs considerably, and is an inefficient way
to provide information services to the public."  Smith would also
like to see an end to the restrictions on providing information
content imposed by the MFJ under the administration of Judge
Greene.

Southwestern Bell follows French example for SourceLine

      Southwestern Bell launched an ambitious gateway trial this
past year in the Houston area.  SW Bell was the first RBOC to
apply the French "Minitel" strategy by seeding the market with
12,000 terminals offered free for the first 6 months.
      The Southwestern RBOC has been working closely with U.S.
Videotel, for the provision of both terminals and services in
what sales manager Guy Miller called "the largest, most ambitious
mass market gateway trial attempted by an RBOC."  By the end of
the summer, over 15,000 customers had come aboard as on-line
subscribers, with over 10,000 of them using the "dumb" terminals.
      Southwestern Bell also went after the small businesses in
the Houston area by offering "a couple of thousand" free U.S.
Videotel minitels, said Scott Hilgeman from SW Bell.
      Offering the terminals to a small business will provide an
information retrieval base that will not tie up a computer
already committed to a specific project or person.  For small
offices that do not usually have computers to spare, this could
be an added bonus.
      Southwestern Bell expects its legislative news, group
organization information, dining locations, electronic mail,
financial news, and travel information along with the 300 other
services to attract the small businesses to its service in the
greater Houston area.

BellSouth first to videotex through unregulated subsidiary

      BellSouth's unregulated subsidiary, BellSouth Enterprises,
is zeroing in on the Atlanta marketplace with the Transtext
Universal Gateway (TUG) by using local services as a competitive
edge.  The project was begun in 1988 and the RBOC reports "good
success" with the project thus far.
      By the end of October 1989, TUG had over 50 ISPs on-line
which translates into many more services.  Customers are being
provided with what BellSouth refers to as "useful and attractive
information," such as the Alliance Theatre Co., Ask-a-Vet, chat
lines, newspapers, Grolier Encyclopedia as well as access to
Dialcom and Delphi.
      Although BellSouth was the first RBOC to introduce its
gateway at the end of August 1988, the RBOC still considers the
service new, is working on feedback, and considers itself to have
a "ubiquity that cannot be denied" in the marketplace.

Nynex introduces Info-Look gateway

      Info-Look, the public network gateway service introduced by
New York Telephone last year, offers residential and business
customers access to a wide range of information, educational,
shop-at-home services via the use of a PC or terminal, modem and
communications software, and a New York Telephone Calling Card.
      "Info-Look service dramatically changes the way people
access and use information," Walter Richard, vice president of
marketing and technology at New York Telephone, boasted.
      "For the first time, our customers can reach and interact
with a variety of services quickly and easily from their home or
office."  Over 60 services are offered to customers in the
greater New York metropolitan area, Long Island, and Westchester,
Putnam and Rockland counties.
      Charges for New York Tel's new service include the cost of
the telephone call to the gateway, plus 5 cents a minute for the
time spent to review the directory, plus the specific rates set
by the information provider (IP) for their individual services.
      Charges for Info-Look may appear separately on the New York
Telephone bill under "Data Services," or the IPs also have the
option to bill customers directly.
      Customers can block access to various services, or price
specific services by following directions on the directory.  All
access to Info-Look can be blocked, at no charge, by calling New
York Tel's business office.
      Nynex first offered the Info-Look service in Vermont,
through New England Telephone, in December of 1988.  The Vermont
gateway is serving customers throughout the state with about 100
information and consumer services.

Canadian videotex activity on the rise

     Having conquered Montreal on a market trial basis, Alex--
Bell Canada's videotex service will move on to Toronto in April
1990 with its information service.
      The company is rolling out in Toronto almost a year ahead of
schedule because of what it calls "customer interest in the
service, market demand, and the growth of the videotex support
industry."
      Last May, the videotex service had attracted almost 13,000
Montreal subscribers, and was predicting 20,000 subscribers by
the summer.
      U.S. Videotel will begin providing 50 services to Alex by
the middle of next year.  In addition to the Texas-based service
provider, La Redoute--a subsidiary of Sears Canada, Consumers
Distributing, National Pagette and Hertz Rent-A-Car have recently
signed on with Alex.

PRODIGY GROWS BY 450 PERCENT, APPROACHES 200,000 HOUSEHOLDS

     Since its launch when the service began with 35,000
households, Prodigy has attracted nearly 200,000 households, for
a total of 315,000 users, as of Dec. 31, 1989.  That translates
to a 450 percent rate of growth over the past year.
      According to President Theodore Papes, Prodigy has more than
doubled the number of member households since it entered the New
York market last spring, when membership stood at 50,000
households.
      Sources say that Sears and IBM have spent more than $700
million on Prodigy thus far, and they still have a way to go
before the service begins to run in the black.
      Prodigy has recently begun packaging its software with a
Hayes Personal Modem which is available in either a 1200 or 2400
baud version.  Although the modem is not fully functional (users
cannot dial in), the package is an attractive "turn-key" system
that provides everything a properly equipped personal computer
owner needs to get on line within 15 to 20 minutes after opening
the box.
      As it stands, the packaging of the software/modem
combination appears to have made Prodigy an appealing Christmas
gift, something the marketers no doubt anticipated, and the
service made a major sales push during the holiday season.
      Nynex, whose electronic gateway for information services
competes with Prodigy, is the first of the RBOCs to enter into a
business relationship with
the Sears/IBM-owned information service provider.
      Prodigy has negotiated bundling relationships with different
companies to enlarge its public profile.
      As far as the banking side is concerned, Prodigy has signed
an exclusive contract with Wells Fargo Bank which prohibits other
California financial institutions through 1990 from offering the
home banking service.

A growth year

      Earlier last year, Prodigy made a big splash entering new
markets in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Chicago,
and the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.
      The Twin City area of 115,0001 homes with personal computers
will also be serviced by Super Valu, a large grocery store chain.
      The Chicago area had on line 375,000 homes with personal
computers and will have NBD, Illinois banks to offer electronic
home banking on the Prodigy service.
      When Prodigy launched its new service in Chicago, it
announced it was in 85,000 households and that figure represented
2.3 persons per household using the service.
      While Prodigy's reach into the consumer marketplace in 1989
was significantly extended, it experienced a few minor setbacks.
Citizens and Southern National (C&S) of Atlanta discontinued its
home banking service, (HomEc) offered via Prodigy on Sept. 15.
      Although C&S gained nearly 50 customers a week since the
service was introduced in October 1988, Bill Van Landingham,
president of C&S in Georgia, said business priorities had been
reviewed and the bank had decided to "allocate resources now
committed to the HomEc program to other activities."
       C&S was servicing 1,100 accounts or households, Scott
Scredon, a bank spokesman, said.  Prodigy said it had 1,500
accounts, but Scredon explained that included couples using the
same account.
      VIEWTEXT learned in late July that C&S was reevaluating its
banking service with Prodigy.  Prodigy officials we contacted at
that time were not aware of the event.

Battle lines drawn in Houston

      Prodigy moved into the Houston area last year the same way
it has moved into all of its areas across the United States.  The
only difference in Houston is that Southwestern Bell Telephone
(SWBT), along with U.S. Videotel, had already staked their claim
to the greater Houston area (VT, April 1989, p. 2).
      In addition to moves into Texas, Prodigy Services Co. has
moved into Denver and Miami.  More than 125,000 homes in the
Denver area and another 140,000 homes in the Miami area with PCs
now have access to Prodigy services.  Prodigy distributed its
free start-up kits in both areas to seed the market and will, of
course, charge $49.95 for the kit after the promotion is
finished.
      The computer-based information and electronic shopping
service, which is owned by IBM and Sears, Roebuck, & Co., has
also entered into an agreement with First Interstate of Denver to
provide the banking service.  Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of
New York will do processing for the Denver bank.
      Prodigy has not come up with a bank for the Miami area as of
yet, but it's a foregone conclusion that the information service
is looking for a banking partner for the area.
      Even sophisticated technology is not immune to occasional
outages.  A Prodigy Services Co. computer went down on May 8,
after a glitch in the software package caused the computer to
overload, and precipitate intermittent outages for the nationwide
on-line system (VT, March 1989, p. 4).
      The computer-based information and electronic shopping
service was "on and off Monday night and Tuesday," said Brian Ek
of Prodigy.
      By [early] Wednesday, "service was restored to some parts of
the nation, and by 8:00 p.m. Wednesday, the service was
completely restored," Ek added.
      Ek said the company will continue to monitor the system, but
the "fix was put in place before the peak usage time on Wednesday
night."  He said he was confident about the restoration but added
no one could promise problems would not occur again.

VIDEOTEX SERVICES FORM MARKETING CONSORTIUM TO SEED CONSUMER
MARKET

     In an effort to provide a shot in the arm to the residential
electronic messaging services marketplace, 7 key videotex
services in the United States joined forces in September 1989 to
promote consumer videotex.  VIEWTEXT discovered that the new
group, dubbed the Videotex Marketing Consortium, planed to seed
the consumer market with access terminals by selling more than
50,000 French Minitels to the regional Bell operating companies
(RBOCs) at a low cost.
      Under the tentative plan, the RBOCs would acquire the
terminals from the group and would distribute them to consumers.
The terminals would be rented at a rate of $7 to $10 per month,
although direct sales of the terminals to interested customers
would be another likely option.
      The 7 members of the consortium are BASELINE II Inc., CTL
Communications Inc., General Videotex Inc., Minitel Services Co.,
Minitel U.S.A. Inc., U.S. Videotel and Videotex Development Corp.
Additional firms are expected to join the group within the next
few weeks.
      Members of the group with services on the new Bell operating
company gateways reported seeing tremendous growth in usage in
the Southwestern Bell Houston market, which was seeded with
terminals, when compared with other markets.
      "We don't think this difference is a question of climate,"
he continued.  "The main factor separating the Houston experience
from that of Burlington, Vt.; the New York City area; Washington,
D.C.; Atlanta and Philadelphia, is that there is a strong
marketing commitment and that terminals--or access devices--are
available in Houston and nowhere else."

Negotiations under way with terminal manufacturers

      All of the members of the group have vowed to invest in the
promotion of the terminals in key Gateway markets.  The Gateway
operator in each case will be contacted to participate in the
promotion and will handle the consumer billing.
      The consortium has set aside a $20 million-plus advertising
and marketing budget to accomplish the task.
      "We got involved in videotex because our service is in the
Minitel format," Linda Brown, director of marketing and
development at Baseline II, an on-line information service for
the film and television industry and a key member of the group,
explained.
      The consortium's efforts, Brown said, will focus on trying
to "re-enact the experience in France" in which French consumers
received terminals at no cost and were charged access charges for
the on-line services they used.
      "We are convinced that the Gateway videotex market is about
to explode in the U.S.," Bruce Forgrieve of U.S. Videotel said.
      "We have proven that our services can be successful when we
work with an RBOC that has adopted a large-scale access device
and marketing strategy.  All that remains for additional success
is to get access devices into the hands of consumers.  This plan
will provide a major impetus to the birth of a new industry."
      In other videotex industry events, Robert Smith, executive
director of the Videotex Industry Association, confided that
within the next year "regional gateways will take a hard look at
gateway business."
      His biggest concern was that "senior managers will forget it
is a long-term business, and view it as short term."  The
executive director emphasized that "this is a business of the
future."  He reminded us it was clearly not a "get rich quick"
business.

THE MINITEL COMES OF AGE AND COMES TO AMERICA

      As the Minitel system in France nears a decade of service,
and boasts 4.5 million users enjoying access to 11,000 services,
France Telecom has set it sights on expanding its services
abroad.  This effort has been focused on the North American
market through its Intelmatique international division, which
includes subsidiaries Minitel USA, Minitel Services Company, and
Minitelnet Inc.
      The 11,000 videotex information services, all France Telecom
has to offer, were made available over Minitelnet Inc. to North
American users of the Minitel network on May 1.  Minitel can be
accessed from over 160 locations in the United States.
Previously, Minitelnet Inc. accessed only 1,500 information
services, and the recently added French Electronic Directory
Service, which offers 25 million white and yellow page listings
in French and English.
      A recent expansion of the Minitel system allows North
American ISPs to market their services online to the over 4
million subscribers in France.  The service is offered through a
network operated by Minitel Services Co., a partnership of
Infonet and Minitel USA.  Local access charges from cities
accross the country vary from 15 cents per minute to $1.65 per
minute.

Now available on RBOC gateways

      The French videotex services are now available on 5 of the
RBOCs' gateways, Southwestern Bell, Bell South, Nynex, U S West
and Bell Atlantic.
      The U S West gateway, which was developed in partnership
with Minitel USA, began providing services in November.  Minitel
terminals are being leased to U S West gateway users in Omaha.
      Scott Magee, director of Minitelnet, said he expected "the
number of English language services to grow" as usage increased.
He added, "We expect to be on all the RBOC gateways within a
year."

Thomas Morgan, VIA chairman, hints of more intelligent terminals

      Thomas Morgan, vice president of Quantum Computer Services
and chairman of the Videotex Industry Association (VIA), told
VIEWTEXT last spring that most RBOCs or online information
services going outside the PC arena had gone with Teletel,
Minitel or dumb terminals but "one unannounced RBOC was planning
to go with a more intelligent terminal."
      Sources concluded that the unannounced RBOC would have been
Pacific Bell, which was at that time planning its now defunct
service.
      Morgan said his company does not consider information
services a mass marketplace at the present time, but more of a PC
arena.
      Another significant issue was the calling number for gateway
services.  Numbers, of course, vary for different areas of the
country.
      Morgan said intelligent software should be able to make the
call and set up service with other intelligent software.
      The VIA president concluded that it was important to have
"acquisition [as well as] retention" of customers.  He felt that
if electronic mail could be worked off-line and be connected to
voice and fax, and international connectivity could be achieved,
progress was truly being made.
      He said he considers inter-connectivity with matching
transaction codes vital to the scheme.
      Blocking services or requiring users to fill out written
requests "ignores services that have shown response."  There are
other means of controlling a secure environment.  Morgan contends
that as more is learned, customers are more interested in price
then ONA and do not have their own network and will not have one
either.

JUDGE GREENE REFUSES INTER-LATA GATEWAY SERVICE

     One of the most significant regulatory events of 1989
concerned the future of inter-LATA videotex gateway services
provided by the RBOCs.  It hasbeen placed in question by Judge
Harold Greene's recent decision against Bell Atlantic.
      The judge's strict interpretation of the Modified Final
Judgment (MFJ) on Jan. 24, 1989, has stopped the RBOCs from
routing information services across local telephone boundaries
using a single gateway processor.
      Bell Atlantic had proposed that a customer could dial a
local node in another part of Pennsylvania and be connected with
the gateway processor in Philadelphia over a leased line.
      The central processor would then provide the customer with a
menu of service providers as well as an index of services.
      After the customer made a selection, the centrally located
gateway processor in Philadelphia would tell the local node to
make the connection with the appropriate service provider.  The
actual connection would be provided by the local telephone
company.

Greene rules architecture to be interexchange

      Greene turned down Bell Atlantic by saying it was
"inescapable that the gateway architecture Bell Atlantic is
proposing would operate on an interexchange basis, and that it
would therefore constitute an interexchange service prohibited by
section II(D)(1) of the decree."
      Bell Atlantic had claimed "the transmission provided in the
context of the gateway service did not violate the decree because
"it is analogous to the regional companies' provision of official
services across LATA boundaries which this court approved shortly
after the breakup."
      The company said the centralized arrangement was no
different from the centralized arrangements it uses to provide
existing telephone services like directory assistance which are
considered official services.
      These services were permitted by the original decree that
broke up the Bell System.
      Judge Greene concluded that "in every significant respect,
it would be the central, multi-LATA processor, that would be the
information services gateway.
      "[Therefore,] the court holds that the operation of a
centralized gateway processor is not an official service."

Centralized gateway service--a new and competitive service

      Greene added, "the centralized gateway service constituted
the heart of a new and competitive service.  On that basis alone,
the attempted analogy with official services has no reasonable
basis."
      Richard Levine, a consultant at the Touche Ross Service
Center in Washington, D.C., told VIEWTEXT that "while the judge's
decision seems to be saying 'no' to centralized use of menus,
there was a slight possibility that a region might be able to get
a narrowly founded waiver of the restriction to support a gateway
for a less populous LATA."
      Levine, an expert in telecommunications regulatory services,
said Judge Greene was concerned about allowing BOCs to operate
these centralized services.  The judge clearly did not want to
set a precedent.
      Levine did say he felt it would be "unfortunate if rural
areas were deprived of gateway services" because of the ruling.
      "Judge Greene's ruling has caused an adverse financial
effect on the BOCs' incentive to employ gateway services in
extended rural areas or smaller LATAs.  The Justice Department
has still not taken a position on the waiver.  It would be
appropriate to give some help on the ruling at this time."

Bell Atlantic's alternative: Justice Department or waiver

      A spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic said the company had "asked
for a ruling, not a waiver.  It only asked if it was a
permissible service, not for a waiver."
      The company considered Greene's stand too strong and lacking
sympathy; however, the issue has not been confronted as a waiver.
This could be an alternative to the situation as it stands.
      Bell Atlantic had the choice of going before Judge Greene or
the Justice Department to file a waiver.
      The RBOC did not think a waiver was necessary.  It had asked
the court to declare that it could use one computer to provide
gateway services throughout the entire state of Pennsylvania.
      The RBOC pointed out that such an arrangement would hold
down the cost of this service, and would provide services to
rural areas and urban centers.
      Bell Atlantic estimated that the cost of putting gateway
equipment in all 5 Pennsylvania LATAs would be approximately $2
million.
      In Bell Atlantic's LATA regions alone, the population ranges
from 200,000 customers to 5 million customers.  There are a total
of 161 LATAs in the United States.

Pacific Telesis looks to interexchange carrier

      Bill Adler, executive director of regulatory matters for
Pacific Telesis,
said his company "will be looking at the possibility of an
interexchange carrier providing any interchange services.
      "Such companies as MCI, AT&T, or other resellers would be a
possibility; California has 120 interexchange carriers operating
in the state.  The problem is they do not operate everywhere in
the state.  We feel like this might have more chance of a
success."
      Adler did say, "Bell Atlantic's proposal was more efficient
and cost-effective.  One of the drawbacks of MFJ is that it gives
engineers heartburn."
      Bell Atlantic had also been prohibited by Greene from even
leasing packet switching lines to carry inter-LATA calls to
gateways.  Thus, Pacific Telesis may turn to the interexchange
carriers as a possible answer to the problems.
      While opposition to RBOC powers continues to be the norm in
the courts, the U.S. Congress is contemplating legislation that
would provide some relief.  It is likely that some progressive
action will be taken on the issue in the coming year.
