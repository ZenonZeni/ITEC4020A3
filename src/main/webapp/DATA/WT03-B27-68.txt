<h2>Harvest Residue: The Untapped Nutrient Source <br>
By Bob Baars</h2>
<h3>Florinsa Farms has developed a system using worms and compost
to lower costs and raise quality </h3>
<p>In the floricultural industry, fertilization not only makes up
a large part of operational budgets but carries an equally high
environmental price tag. Because production depends on economics
and consumer demand, environmentally friendlier production
methods are becoming increasingly important. Yet not many
companies are aware of the potential their harvest residue has as
a first step to meet these demands. For Florinsa Farms in
Ecuador, composting provides the means to effectively manage
nutritional and environmental demands as well as production
costs. <br wp="br2">
</p>
<p><strong>Harvest Residue Benefits <br>
</strong>A common belief is that merely piling up organic matter
will eventually produce compost. Unfortunately, this concept is a
broad and often incorrect generalization of a very complex
micro-biological science. Composting is an exact science with its
own rules and limitations. For it to be a successful source of
nutrients, growers must first understand the mechanisms at work.
Floricultural companies produce tremendous amounts of biomass and
a substantial amount, the harvest residue, remains on-farm.
Growers burn, destroy or produce compost with this residue.
Composting is good practice, as the residue contains valuable
nutrients. As good money has been paid for these nutrients, it is
common sense to re-apply them to the soil. </p>
<p>However, the nutrient content is not the only consideration
when producing compost. As crops grow, they consume organic
matter as humus from the soil. Humus content determines the
fertility of a soil. Applying chemical fertilizers as the only
form of nutrition does not add any humus-forming organic matter
to the soil. Instead the soil is gradually depleted of humus and
thus of its fertility. Reapplying the harvest residue as compost
saves money and replenishes valuable exported humus needed to
maintain production and quality standards. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p><strong>Soil Breakdown<br>
</strong>Nutrients and water are taken up through the roots in
the soil. Soil must have buffer capacity to allow storage of
nutrients: humus. This substance is made exclusively by the
activity of microorganisms transforming organic substances, crude
nutrients applied to the soil, into stabilized and readily
digestible food. The presence or absence of microorganisms in the
soil is very important and determines its health status.
Decreased microbial activity implies increased susceptibility to
diseases and pest attacks. The management of microorganisms
should not be considered a hands-off responsibility. The image is
that they grow automatically. However, microorganisms are living
creatures and change rapidly with changes in their living
conditions. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p>Their presence or absence cannot be determined by simple
chemical analysis. Chromatography enables the soil status to be
visualized. It produces &quot;soil pictures&quot; that provide
data such as soil condition, structure, microbiological status
and fertility concerning a soil or compost. Chromatography can
provide a picture library of the gradual improvement or
degeneration of a soil and notably its microbiological status. <br
wp="br1">
</p>
<p><strong>Decomposers <br>
</strong>When harvest residue is piled into a heap, it is invaded
by bacteria that specialize in breaking down organic compounds.
Mesophilic decomposers are the first to invade. They quickly
concentrate their efforts to heat up the pile. They increase
temperature with the energy they use to break down residue. </p>
<p>Next, thermophilic microorganisms begin working. At the higher
temperatures, mesophilic bacteria are eliminated by their own
activity and become food for thermophilic organisms. Their hunger
soon causes the temperature in the pile to peak, signaling the
end of the breakdown cycle. As thermophilic microorganisms
deplete their food supply, overall activity in the heap
diminishes. While the temperature drops, several organisms are
waiting to initiate the next stage in the process: stabilization. </p>
<p>When growers recognize the smell of good soil, they usually
are not aware that it is actually actinomycete organisms they are
smelling. Actinomycetes are crucial to humus formation in compost
as well as in the soil. These bacteria release nitrogen and
carbon equally, and they possess the ability to produce
antibiotics. This is where chromatography comes in handy again,
as it will &quot;show&quot; stabilized nutrients on die clay
humus complex as well as readily available nutrients. The
stabilized nutrients are especially important in composting. Very
few systems stabilize nutrients sufficiently in order to prevent
leaching. Equally few systems provide the carefully balanced
microbiological life that increases the health and fertility of
the soil significantly. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p><strong>Composting at Florinsa Farms <br>
</strong>Several composting methods are practiced worldwide.
Florinsa Farms, after several years of experimenting and
conducting trials with composting and vermiculture, have now
opted for aerobic composting. They found that it is possible to
produce healthier crops with microbially active compost, reducing
chemical fertilizer input and production costs significantly.
Moreover, to enhance quality, they grow additional ingredients
on-farm by a process that provides tons of superfluous,
nutrient-rich, green material. The farms also have other benefits
from this system: purifying the water in the storage basins and
reducing evaporation. </p>
<p>At Florinsa Farms, management discovered that compost doesn't
just happen, it requires skill. What is often considered to be a
compost heap is in many instances the remains of a anaerobic
composting process, where more valuable elements are lost than
are stored. Anaerobic composting is an ineffective and long-term
process. Here mainly anaerobic bacteria are at work, and despite
the fact that compost is produced, much of the nutrient potential
is used up by the anaerobic bacteria and fungi and such compost
may produce dangerous toxins such as cadaverin! <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p><strong>Aerobic microbial compostinq <br>
</strong>Although not many growers are aware of the aerobic
composting process, it is a truly effective composting process
that utilizes 50 to 85 carefully selected bacteria and fungi
strains and is capable of recycling harvest residue in six to ten
weeks! The final result is with excellent water holding capacity,
good CEC qualities and readily available stabilized nutrients. </p>
<p>What is more, the compost has many microorganisms that will
continue their work once applied to the soil. It provides a ready
menu for plants as well as for physical decomposers such as
mites, millipedes, centipedes, springtails and earthworms. </p>
<p>But why provide food for earthworms as we can make a ready
product such as worm compost? The answer is simple. In
vermiculture, microorganisms must first decompose the harvest
residue into digestible chunks before it can pass through the
worms' digestive tracts. As this takes place in rather flat beds,
considerable time and space is needed to process </p>
<p>significant quantities. With aerobic composting much less time
and space is needed to recycle all material. Also, in Florinsa
Farms' soil management system, they also want food for
earthworms. Vermicompost, as a ready product, does not provide
this, but aerobic compost provides a ready food to nurture the
needs of earthworms. Consider that earthworms make more nutrients
(phosphorous and potassium) available, neutralize soil pH
d&quot;ugh the action of their calciferous gland, improve @e and
infiltration rates, improve soil structure, stimulate microbial
activity and although it is as yet unclear why, reduces parasitic
nematode counts. All of this is free, provided you feed and
manage them. <br wp="br1">
</p>
<p><strong>Management <br>
</strong>The more types of microorganisms in the soil, the
better. Beneficial microorganisms need to be introduced to the
soil and fed organics to help them multiply. You must bring their
population to the appropriate level. This is where compost plays
a major role. </p>
<p>You have to manage soil organisms: Nurture them, accommodate
them, and make sure they have sufficient air- everything they
need to thrive. The result is healthy soil with strong
antagonistic abilities to combat diseases and nematodes. By
definition this means less chemical crop protection, stabilized
nutrients that will not leach and sensible economics and
decreased environmental pressure. <br wp="br1">
