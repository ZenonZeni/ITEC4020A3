<HR>
  For Immediate Relief:
<HR>
      With Pests:  Spray the following mixture to control most
      pests. Spray directly on pests if possible, spray lawns in
      afternoon. Handpick if possible.  Avoid on hot days.

                    In gallon sprayer, fill with filtered water to near
                    the top, add 5 drops Tabasco sauce (organic),
                    add 5 drops Dr. Bronners Peppermint soap
                    and 2 drops garlic oil.
                    1 cup vinegar
                    Test strength first to avoid damaging lawn.
<HR>
      With Diseases: Spray the following mixture on lawn and soil :
                 In a gallon of water  add
                   5 drops garlic oil, or any vegetable oil
                   5 tablespoons baking soda,
                   1/2 cup  liquid seaweed
                   5 tablespoons Dr. Bronners Peppermint soap
                   1/2 cup vinegar or apple cider. Add everything in but the vinegar.
                   after everything has been dissolved in the water, add the
                   vinegar! Spray on affected areas as often as needed.
        Control overhead watering, try to water in early am.
        Avoid spraying on hot days. Spray in early am.

<HR>
      With Fertilization: Nutritional problems will lead to pest/disease
      problems. Compost application is the preferred method of fertilizing
      your lawn.  Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers.
      Applications should be
      done 4 times per year for southern and twice for
      northern climates.

<HR>
     With Watering: avoid overhead watering late in day.
                    Use garden filter when ever possible.
