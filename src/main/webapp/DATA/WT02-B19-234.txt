<h1>Careers in Special Education<BR>and Related Services</h1>

<hr><blockquote>
<b>"My greatest satisfaction is seeing the children in my class make real gains and knowing that I
have helped them get to where they need to be."</b><br><br>
<b>"The biggest challenge to me is working with so many different kids with such a variety of
needs."</b><br>
<b>- Ib‚ Crawley, Preschool Special Educator</b><br><p></blockquote><br>
<hr>
<em>Do you want to make a difference in the lives of students with special
needs?</em> Do you like working with children and youth? Are you searching for a career
that is a calling and not just a job? If you are interested in an opportunity to improve the lives of
children with disabilities, consider becoming a special education teacher or a related services
professional.<p> 
Professionals who teach and provide services to children with disabilities have challenging yet
rewarding careers. These professionals include special education teachers, school psychologists,
physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, school counselors,
school nurses, and school social workers. <p>
<b>The Students.</b> Students who receive special instruction and services vary greatly in their
needs.  Like all children, they differ from one another in ability, age, learning style, and
personality.  Such students have unique learning needs that may require special teaching
approaches, the use of adaptive materials, and other support services such as speech-language
therapy. Students with disabilities come from all cultural backgrounds and may even speak
another language.<p>
Some students have cognitive impairments, such as mental retardation, which can range from
mild to profound. Others have specific learning disabilities that are manifested in specific
cognitive impairments. Yet other students may have physical disabilities that limit mobility and
may require the use of wheelchairs or other assistive devices. Some students' impairments are
strictly sensory, such as hearing loss and vision impairments. Chronic health problems and
multiple disabilities can complicate learning potential for many of these youngsters.<p>
<b>The Professionals.</b> Special education and related services professionals in the public
schools provide specially designed instruction to individuals with disabilities from ages 3 to 21.
Some public schools also make available direct services to infants and toddlers, ages birth to 3. In
addition to the special education classroom teacher, there are school-based and/or contracted
physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, audiologists, occupational therapists, school
psychologists, and school social workers.  Their specialized services can also be provided in
hospitals, medical centers, private practice environments, and the child's own home.<p>
<b>The Law.</b> Federal legislation, reauthorized in 1991 and now called the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), requires that public schools provide appropriate instruction
and supportive services to meet the education, social, emotional, and vocational needs of students
with disabilities. To qualify for special education services, a student must have a unique learning
need that differs from other similarly aged students. This need is individually determined through
an interdisciplinary assessment, and the education and services to be provided are planned jointly
by the child's parents, teachers, other school professionals, and the students themselves if they are
able.<p>
<hr>
<h2>Consider a Professional Career in Teaching or Clinical Service</h2>
The following information provides an introduction and overview of careers that involve
working with youngsters who have disabilities. For more detailed information on a given field or
specialization, see the contact information for professional associations at the end of this article.
Even though these professions have been described separately, it is rare that these professionals
work with students with special needs independently. All of these professionals work with
families as a team to plan and implement the appropriate educational programs for their
students.<p>
<b>Audiologists</b> identify, assess, and provide treatment for hearing, balance, and related
disorders.  They also recommend and evaluate hearing aids and other types of assistive hearing
devices.  While the work is mainly diagnostic, some audiologists have experience with sign
language and  lip reading and can provide ongoing therapy/aural rehabilitation.<p>
<b>Occupational Therapists</b> are concerned with an individual's ability to fully participate in
desired life tasks and roles including school and/or work, self-care, and play/leisure, as
independently as possible. Using purposeful and age-appropriate activities the occupational
therapist assists children with disabilities to achieve important life tasks. Occupational therapists
also consult with families, teachers, care givers, and others to help facilitate the child's growth and
development within all of the environments in which children live.<p>
<b>Physical Therapists</b> provide treatment to relieve pain, limit or prevent permanent physical
disability, and improve the mobility of people who have an injury or a disease. Physical
therapists evaluate a person's medical history; test and measure their strength, range of motion,
and ability to function; and develop written treatment plans. Appropriate treatment could include
therapeutic exercise, joint mobilization and range-of-motion exercises, therapeutic massage, and
ambulation training. Traction, ultrasound, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, and cold therapy may
also be a part of treatment programs. Physical therapists implement the appropriate treatment
plan, document progress, conduct periodic reevaluations, and modify treatment if necessary.<p>
<b>Rehabilitation Counselors</b> provide vocational services to students with disabilities in
order to enable that person to secure and retain suitable employment. These services can include
vocational counseling and guidance, vocational training, and selective job placement.<p>
<b>School Counselors</b> work with students, teachers, parents, and administrators to help
ensure that students' educational, vocational, and emotional needs are being met. School
counselors provide crisis intervention services and individual and group counseling to help all
students develop their educational, social, career, and personal strengths and become responsible
and productive citizens.<p>
<b>School Nurses</b> promote and monitor the health status of children. They identify
health-related problems that can be barriers to the learning process and assist in the removal of
these barriers.  School nurses focus on the prevention of illness and the early detection and
correction of health problems. They provide health assessments and develop and implement health
plans, such as initiating referral procedures and providing health counseling. They also implement
school health protocols, such as administering medications to children with special health
needs.<p>
<b>School Psychologists</b>  provide consultation to teachers and families, psychological
counseling, student assessments, crisis intervention, and other direct services to children with
learning, behavioral, and emotional problems, and their families. They also provide preventive
services to improve the climate for learning. In many cases, psychologists work with classroom
teachers to develop a behavior management plan for an individual student or for an entire
class.<p>
<b>School Social Workers</b> provide a link between home, school, and community. This
service enables students and their families to overcome social and personal problems which
impede learning. School social workers provide individual and group counseling, consultation to
teachers, and other services which help students cope with their disabilities. They collaborate
with community agencies and provide case management for students and families requiring
multiple services.<p>
<b>Special Education Teachers</b> provide instruction and adapt and develop materials to match
the learning styles, strengths, and special needs of each student. They work to ensure that students
with educational disabilities reach their learning potential. There are several specialty areas within
special education. These areas of specialization, which vary across the country, are
usually classified by disability category, such as teacher of students with learning disabilities or
teacher of students with physical disabilities. In some places, special education teachers are
categorized by the age of the child they serve, such as preschool special educator. In some
schools, special education classes may be made up of students who have different disabilities; in
others, the class may be designed for students who all have the same disability to varying
degrees. Now that more children and youth with disabilities are being served within the general
education classroom in their neighborhood school, special education teachers are also acting as
consultants to general education teachers, or are coteaching classes with them.<p>
<b>Speech-Language Pathologists</b> identify, assess, and provide treatment for communication
and swallowing function and their disorders. They evaluate overall speech, and receptive and
expressive language communicative abilities. They provide early speech-language intervention as
well as speech, language, and voice therapies. Pediatric communication disabilities are seen, for
example, in youngsters with developmental delays, cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, cleft lip and
palate, and traumatic (closed) head injury, among others.<p>
<hr>
<h2>Employment Opportunities are Excellent</h2>
There are shortages of special education teachers and related services professionals across the
nation.  In most states the demand for qualified teachers and related services professionals
exceeds the available supply. These shortages are projected to grow over the next
decade.<p>
Figure 1 (below) shows the number of teachers needed as of 1991-92 (the most current data
available), to work with students with various disabilities. As can be seen, the most serious
shortages are for teachers of children with specific learning disabilities, teachers of children with
speech and/or language impairments, teachers of students with mental retardation, and teachers of
students with serious emotional disturbances. <p>

Shortages of special educators and related services personnel have continued to rise over the
last few years, including shortages of qualified professionals available to provide services to young
children (ages birth to 5). Vacancies vary by state, according to the type of teacher-professional
needed and the regions within the state. Generally, rural areas have need for professionals across
all areas of special education and related services. There is a need in all areas for culturally and
ethnically diverse professionals, particularly in urban areas; there is also a high need for
professionals who are bilingual. To try to minimize personnel shortages, many states operate
employment clearinghouses or placement services that match professionals looking for jobs with
educational settings that have positions available. Information about these services is available
from the<a href="mailto:ncpse@cec.sped.org"> NCPSE</a><p>
<hr>
<h2>Working with Young Children - The Multidisciplinary Team</h2>
A variety of professionals provide services to children with disabilities from birth to age five.
They include early childhood special education teachers, physical therapists, occupational
therapists, speech-language pathologists, nutritionists, psychologists, physicians, and nurses.
These professionals work together as a team with young children who have early developmental
delays and their families. Early intervention aims to prevent or lessen the educational impact of
these disabilities. <p>
<h2>Working with Older Students - Preparing for Life After High School</h2>
Some school personnel work with secondary school students with disabilities to prepare these
students to transition into life after high school.  Career education, vocational education,
work-study programs, transition planning, college-planning, and community-based training are all
programs designed to help students with disabilities move into independent living. Federal
legislation mandates that every eligible student have transition services as part of their program
no later than age 16 and when appropriate, beginning at age 14 or younger. <p>
<h2>Preparation </h2>
Becoming a special education or related services professional requires specialized professional
education and skills.  At least a bachelor's degree is required to become a special education
teacher. To be licensed in some states, a graduate (master's) degree may also be required.
Professional preparation includes course work, clinical and field experience with children with
disabilities, and student (practicum) teaching. The types of professional preparation programs
offered in colleges and universities can vary widely but generally lead to eligibility for special
education teacher certification in the state where the program is offered. However, not all special
education specialty areas are offered by all university special education programs. Information
about specific programs can be obtained from the National Clearinghouse for Professions in
Special Education. You should also contact the department of special education in the college or
university of your choice to discuss course and career options open to you.<p>
Professional preparation requirements for any of the related services professions varies
somewhat. Table 1 lists the degrees required for some of these professions. Preparation includes
course work and extensive clinical practicum experience in providing services to children and
adults. Interested persons should contact the professional association(s) directly. (See listing at
end of article) That association will also have information on college and university training
programs and requirements for certification and licensure.<p>
Some special education and related services specialties have "paraprofessional" level positions
available for those individuals who want to work in a supervised capacity with children and
youth with disabilities, and/or cannot afford or make time for the comprehensive schooling
required of the certified professional. Paraprofessionals work under the supervision of the
specialist, supporting and providing selected services to the children. In some professions,
paraprofessional positions may be the first step on a career ladder, and with further education and
training may lead to full certification as a professional.<p>
<h2>Deciding on a Career </h2>
The best way to learn more about careers in special education and related services professions is
to talk to professionals already practicing in the field. You should feel free to contact special
education and related services professionals in your local school system as well as faculty at
nearby colleges and universities. Find out what they do, why they chose their professions, and
what they find challenging and rewarding about their work. The more you know about careers
focused on children and youth with disabilities, the better able you will be to make an informed
career choice. <p>
If you have never worked with an individual who has a disability, you may want to test your
interest through volunteer activities that can provide hands-on experience. Depending on your
availability and interests, you may choose to become involved in a one-time event, a short-term
project, or a long-term commitment. For example, you may choose to tutor students in the
classroom or after school. Or you may want to be a "buddy" to someone with a disability by
going out to lunch or dinner, seeing a movie, or just visiting with each other. <p><br>
Contact your local school district or special education consortium to participate in special
events and to provide volunteer services. Volunteers are often needed for play groups, individual
tutoring assistance, after school care programs, etc. The volunteer bureau for organizations in
your area may also be contacted to obtain information about organizations and agencies that offer
volunteer experiences. The National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education also has
lists of national organizations seeking volunteers. <p>
<h2>Careers that Make a Difference</h2>
Professionals who teach and provide services to students with disabilities have challenging yet
rewarding careers. A career in special education or one of the related services professions offers
an opportunity to work in partnership with students, parents, professional colleagues, and the
community. It is an opportunity to have a positive, lasting impact on the lives of children and
youth with special needs. <p>
