AirSensors, U. of CA to Develop Fuel Injector System for CNG and LPG

AirSensors' (Cerritos, Calif.) wholly-owned subsidiary, IMPCO
Technologies, has teamed up with the University of California,
Irvine (UCI) to develop a precision machined valve array injector to
be used for CNG and LPG (liquid petroleum gas) automotive
applications.

AirSensors has contributed $25,000 to the UCI engineering department
to get the research program kicked off.  Additional funding will
come from the federal TRP-Technology Reinvestment Program and grants
from the state of California that subsidize interaction with the
alternative fuel industry.

The principal investigators for AirSensors are Edward Tate and Dr.
Mo Kebaili.  UCI will utilize the talents of professors Dr. Leonard
Ferrari, who is an expert on digital signal processing and computer
graphics; Dr. Richard Nelson, who is an expert on solid state
physics and semiconductor processors and Dr.  John Larue, who has
expertise in turbulence, fluid mechanics and heat transfer.

For further information, contact Andrea Van Leeuwen of Carl Thompson
Associates at 303/494-5472 or Dale Rasmussen of AirSensors at
206/575-1594.

5,000 Mile Sojourn by Propane Pick-Up Tests Refueling Infrastructure

Saying he would "rather import natural gas from Texas and propane
from Louisiana than petroleum from Kuwait and gasoline from
Venezuela," former Department of Energy employee Steve McCrea viewed
a trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Ohio in his propane-fueled pickup as a
perfect opportunity to test the infrastructure for alternative
fuels.

In the March issue of BUTANE-PROPANE NEWS, McCrea reports on his
trip, which -- with side-trips to New England and Long Island --
covered 5,292 miles and consumed 178 gallons of propane.  McCrea
reported that 60% of the driving was on propane in the dual-fuel
truck -- accounting for 3026 miles at 17 mpg.

Fuel stops were not always an easy proposition, McCrea says, because
the "National Directory of Propane Refueling Stations" was not
geographically helpful to a stranger in a given region.  Add to that
the fact that many propane dealers close early, making refueling
after 5 p.m. problematic and limiting the use of propane to about
800 miles of driving in 24 hours.

A refueling stop, which included finding the fuel seller, averaged
an hour, McCrea found.  Prices varied, averaging around $1.50 per
gallon, but cost more at campgrounds because owners charge the same
price for motor fuel as for barbecue grill propane.

DOE-provided tax incentives bring conversion costs down, while
sporting an AFV decal brings the average cost of refueling down at
the pump -- to around $1.06 per gallon (in Florida), or about 14
cents less than gasoline, said McCrea.

McCrea's primary goal was to prove a road trip could be taken on
propane, "but hundreds of Canadians already know this," he points
out.  His second objective was to spread the word about DOE's
toll-free AFV Hotline (800/423-1363), which he had emblazoned on the
side of his car.  His third goal was to simply test the
infrastructure.

McCrea strongly suggests that propane directories in the future
should include maps to help find the stations and highway offramp
signs should include "LPG" in addition to gas/diesel.

ExproFuels, ATI Sign Contract for CNG Conversions in Uzbekistan

In March, the Exploration Company announced it had signed a
participation agreement through its ExproFuels Division with the
American Technical Institute (ATI) and the American Engineering Inc.
(AEI) of Memphis, Tenn. to provide technical evaluation, project
management, and assistance for its joint venture with the government
of Uzbekistan.

The Uzbekistan project envisions the total conversion of Uzbekistan's
government fleet of 350,000 vehicles to run on natural gas.  In order
to bring this about, ATI/AEI has signed agreements with agencies of
the Uzbek government to provide CNG conversion and fuel station
equipment, installation and maintenance training, manufacturing
technology, and overall management of the project.

ExproFuels president, Tom Gose, remarked, "This is by far the
largest and most economical project I have seen in this industry to
date.  The Uzbekistan government has the opportunity to save a very
substantial amount per vehicle converted per year due to the wide
price margin between imported gasoline and locally produced natural
gas.

For more information, contact Exprofuels at 210/496-5300.

Metropane Awarded Contract for CNG/Diesal Conversions & Training
in Louisville

Metropane was recently selected to provide dual fuel CNG Diesel
conversions and training to the City of Louisville-Jefferson County,
Ky., as part of a $1.8 million CMAQ funded project.

Metropane was also contracted in mid-March to convert 15 Windstar
vans for Southern Connecticut Gas.  The value of this contract is
approximately $65,000.

For more information, contact Gregory Siber of Metropane at
800/648-0233.
