        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Educational &amp; Language Development with
        Audiological Support </h3>
        <p>The academic program provides a pre- and elementary
        school curriculum, in combination with auditory/oral
        training, for profoundly hearing impaired children age
        three through eighth grade. </p>
        <p>The academic goal of the School is to move students
        into mainstream schools at the earliest appropriate age. </p>
        <p>However, instilling the gifts of listening and spoken
        language, which give our students an opportunity to reach
        their full academic, social and personal potential, is
        the true hallmark of St. Joseph's. </p>
        <p>Strong moral development is another component of this
        education. Proper judgment, conduct and appearance, and
        the values which guide them, are taught to the children
        and reflected in the staff. </p>
        <p>The &quot;culture&quot; at St. Joseph's is a balance
        of hard challenges and soft hearts. The School sets high
        expectations for its students and does everything it can
        to help each child achieve them. St. Joseph's is not
        content for its graduates to cope. They are encouraged to
        excel. These students meet any measure of success
        including, most importantly, their own. </p>
        <p>These accomplishments come gradually. The
        auditory/oral approach requires intense work over a long
        period. Students are given curricula designed to their
        individual needs. They are also given a lot of personal
        attention: the student/teacher ration is 3:1. </p>
        <p>The teaching of listening and speech never stops at
        St. Joseph's, regardless of time, place or situation. All
        faculty and staff encourage the children to constantly
        use oral communication. Formal speech therapy is
        conducted daily in one-on-one sessions, in reading class,
        in cochlear rehabilitation for implanted students, and in
        all general education courses. </p>
        <p>The academic program is organized into three
        departments: primary, middle and upper schools, which are
        equivalent to a mainstream school's grades K-1, 2-4 and
        5-8 respectively. </p>
        <p>Middle and upper school operate on the departmental
        schedule. All students take a full complement of
        mainstream courses taught by trained educators of the
        deaf with specialties in these academic subjects. </p>
        <p>This well-rounded curriculum includes computer class,
        science lab, art, cognitive development, library/media
        center periods, physical education and field trips. </p>
        <p>A complete pediatric audiology department on-site
        ensures that the children have the highest quality
        technical assistance. The audiology department conducts
        diagnostic testing of each child's hearing level on a
        regular basis and calibrates the students' personal
        hearing devices as well as the School's FM systems to
        maintain their optimum operation levels. </p>
        <p>SJI's education offers deaf children what other
        children have, with one nice exception. Our students
        don't get in trouble when talking in class. </p>
