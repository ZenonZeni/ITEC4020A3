<h3>ENERGY DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL 	TO WORK WITH LOCAL
MONOLINGUAL CLASS ON HANDS-ON SCIENCE PROJECTS</h3><P>


	Dr. Martha Krebs, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) assistant secretary for the Office of Energy Research, will visit Hanson Elementary in Commerce City to talk about the importance of science and to work on hands-on science projects with the young students.  Krebs will also work with the all-Spanish speaking, fourth- and fifth-grade class on computers donated by DOE's Golden Field Office in Golden, Colo.  The Golden Field Office donated 15 surplus computers to Hanson last year, which doubled the number of student computers at the school.  DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) also donated a computer software package, the National Geographic Kids Network, a telecommunications package that allows students to collect data from homemade solar collectors and share their data with students from around the world. <P>

	Krebs will be available to discuss NREL programs her office funds, the state of science research in DOE and the nation, the impact of budget cuts relating to science and other energy-related issues. <P>
