<h4>Sweeteners - Common Position adopted for Sweeteners' Amending Directive</h4>

Political agreement had been reached on the Common Position for a Directive amending the Sweeteners Directive (94/35) at the Internal Market Council on 28 May.  Formal adoption took place at the Environment Council on 25 June.  The Common Position will now be referred to the European Parliament for a second reading before being returned, with any proposals for amendment, to the Council to be considered for formal adoption.
<p>
The amendments are designed to update the Directive to take into account a number of technical developments in the field of sweeteners since the original Directive and to improve the text (e.g. there is a definition of <i>quantum satis</i> which was missing from the original Directive).

<h4>BSE and Beef</h4>

There were further discussions at the European Council meeting in Florence on this topic.  The European Council welcomed the Commission's framework for the eradication of BSE in cattle in the UK and for the restoration of the single market in beef.  This framework sets out the further action that the UK is taking, which, when in place, will enable  the step-by-step relaxation of current restrictions on UK exports of bovine products.  The British plan for measures to eliminate BSE was approved by the Standing Veterinary Committee last week.  The European Council invited the Commission to present the appropriate decisions when it considers that the necessary conditions, based on scientific and technical advice, have been fulfilled.  Such decisions are to be taken exclusively on the basis of public health and objective scientific criteria, in accordance with existing procedures.

<h4>Revised Proposal for Decision on the maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain foods</h4>

The Commission had adopted on the 19 April 1995 a proposed decision on maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain foods.  The aim would be to allow Member States to retain national prohibitions for food which had traditionally been produced without certain additives.  The proposal was required since certain Member States wish to retain prohibitions even though the new Community food additives directives would allow their use.
<p>
The following foods were listed by the Commission following requests from Member States with an indication of what additives would be prohibited:<br>
<ul>
<li>Germany - beer - all except propellant gas
<li>Greece - 'feta' cheese - all
<li>France - 'traditional French bread' - all
<li>France - preserved truffles - all
<li>France - preserved snails - all
<li>France - goose, duck and turkey preserves ('confit') - all except preservatives
<li>Austria - 'Bergkase' - all except preservatives
<li>Finland - 'Mammi' - all except preservatives
</ul>
<p>
The proposal was given a first reading in the European Parliament on 16 January 1996.  The Commission has now amended its proposal to take into account the Parliament's comments. The amendments were adopted on 6 May 1996 and published in the Official Journal on 26 June 1996.  The amendment makes it clear that the foodstuffs are those which are prepared using traditional methods.  The list now reads:<br>
<ul>
<li>Germany - beer brewed following German tradition - all except propellant gas
<li>Greece - 'feta' following Greek tradition - all
<li>France - 'traditional French bread' - all
<li>France - preserved truffles following French tradition - all
<li>France - preserved snails following French tradition - all
<li>France - goose, duck and turkey preserves ('confit') following French tradition - all except preservatives
<li>Austria - 'Bergkase' following Austrian tradition - all except preservatives
<li>Finland - 'Mammi' following Finnish tradition - all except preservatives
</ul>
<p>
The proposal will now be considered by the Council.

<h4>Egg Size Grades</h4>

The Commission has prepared a revised draft proposal <i>(See earlier items on Egg Size Grades)</i> which will be put to the Eggs and Poultry Management Committee on 16 July.  The following grades would be defined:<br>
XL  -  VERY LARGE:   73g and more<br>
L  -  LARGE:  from 63g up to 73g<br>
M  -  MEDIUM:  from 53g up to 63g<br>
S  -  SMALL:  under 53g<br>
On packs, the weight grading would be indicated by the respective letter as indicated above, which may be supplemented by the corresponding terms and weight ranges.  The revised date of application would be 1 August 1996 with the same transition period.

<h4>Adoption of EU Regulation Laying Down a Community Procedure for Flavouring Substances Used or Intended for Use In or On Foodstuffs (Regulation ***/96)</h4>

At the Environment Council Meeting on 25 June 1996, the above Regulation was formally adopted.  The Regulation provides for a programme which will ultimately lead to the positive listing of substances used in or on foods as flavourings.  It therefore provides rules for the implementation of the requirements of Directive 88/388/EEC on "the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production".
<p>
The Regulation contains an Annex listing general use criteria which must be met by all flavouring substances
<p>
Member States must notify the Commission (within one year) a list of the flavouring substances which may be used in or on foodstuffs marketed in their territory.  Certain specified information must be supplied at the time of notification.  Following scrutiny, the Commission will publish a register of the substances the legal use of which in one Member State must be recognized by the other Member States.  The register will then be formally adopted (within one year of the notification period).  A provision allows for modification of the register if new information relating to public health arises.
<p>
A programme to check whether the substances on the register meet the general use criteria will be adopted (within 10 months of the adoption of the register).  This will be completed within 5 years so as to provide a list of flavouring substances the use of which is authorized to the exclusion of all others.

<h4>BSE, Beef and Britain</h4> 

Protecting human health is the overriding principle for the Commission in relation to measures to eradicate BSE, Commission President Jacques Santer said yesterday [19 June 1996].  The Commission will maintain this position regardless of political pressure, Santer told the European Parliament, using the best and most up-to-date scientific knowledge as the basis for decision-making.<p>

A position paper prepared by the Commission for the Florence European Council this weekend outlines the procedures that it believes are necessary to enable agreement on the gradual lifting of the export ban on UK beef.  These include a package of thorough measures to eliminate BSE, to protect human health by preventing exposure to the BSE agent, and to restore consumer confidence.  Any decisions at EU level would have to be taken up by Community inspections to verify effective implementation.  The Commission expects the UK to end its non-cooperation policy towards the EU, without which there can be no agreement at Florence, Santer said.  A Multi-disciplinary Committee on BSE is being established, to ensure that the scientific advice given to the Commission takes into account the widest possible range of expertise.  A steering group has been nominated to set up the committee.

<a name="96-8"></a><i>MAFF Letter 18 June 1996</i><p>

<h4>Egg Size Grades</h4>

A further letter from MAFF now indicates that the proposed amendments described previously have been withdrawn by the Commission.  This is because the proposed use of the term JUMBO (for eggs of 73g and more) would create a legal problem in Germany where the term 'Jumbo' has apparently been registered as a trade mark.
<p>
The proposal will therefore be represented at the next Management Committee with an alternative term denoting the largest eggs.  At the moment MAFF indicate that the Commission seem to prefer 'Very Large' which is easily translated into each of the Member State languages and cannot be confused with any quality indication as suggested by the terms 'extra' or 'super'.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="96-6"></a><i>MAFF Letter - 12 June 1996</i><p>

<h4>Egg Size Grades: Regulation No ***/96 amending Regulation No 1274/91 introducing detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation No 1907/90 on certain marketing standards for eggs.
</h4>
Agreement has been reached on 11th June at the Eggs and Poultry Meat Management Committee to this new Regulation.  Minor changes are being made to the formal text and it will then be published in the Official Journal.
<p>
It will introduce revised categories for different sizes of eggs.  The new provision (by amending Article 8 of Regulation 1274/91) will require the use of the following terms for Grade A eggs:
<p>
JUMBO:  73g and more<br>
LARGE:  from 63g up to 73g<br>
MEDIUM: from 53g up to 63g<br>
SMALL:  under 53g
<p>
Provision is made for equivalent terms for large packs of eggs (by amendment to Article 33).  Certain additional changes are made so as to incorporate Swedish language terms.  The Regulation is expected to be effective from 1st July 1996 but a transitional period will be allowed until 31 December 1997.

<h4>BSE Controls</h4>

The Commission adopted (11th June 1996) a Decision (96/362) specifying the processing techniques to be used in the production of beef-derived gelatine and tallow in the UK.   The Decision amends Decision 96/239 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).  After these requirements have been met and checked, the Commission will consult the Standing Veterinary Committee to fix a date on which exports of gelatine and tallow can be resumed.  In the case of semen, the export ban can be lifted without any preconditions or controls.

<h4>Protected Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin</h4>

On the 12 June 1996 the Commission adopted Regulation 1107/96 which lists those geographical indication and designations of origin which have been registered and protected under Regulation 2081/92.  An additional supplementary list was subsequently adopted on the 1 July 1996.
<p>
The use of these geographical indications and designations of origin will be confined to producers in a limited area who comply with closely defined rules of production.  The Commission has also proposed a five-year transitional period, during which Member States may allow the continued use of registered names, on certain conditions, for products that do not meet the criteria for listed food products.
<p>
For the United Kingdom, the following are given protection:<br>
<ul>
<li>Orkney beef
<li>Orkney lamb
<li>Scottish beef
<li>Scottish lamb
<li>Shetland lamb
<li>White Stilton cheese/Blue Stilton cheese
<li>West Country farmhouse Cheddar cheese
<li>Beacon Fell traditional Lancashire cheese
<li>Swaledale cheese/Swaledale ewes' cheese
<li>Bonchester cheese
<li>Buxton blue
<li>Dovedale cheese
<li>Single Gloucester
<li>Jersey Royal potatoes
<li>Herefordshire cider/perry
<li>Worcestershire cider/perry
<li>Gloucestershire cider/perry
<li>Newcastle brown ale
<li>Kentish ale and Kentish strong ale
<li>Rutland bitter

<h4>EC Regulation (2081/92) - Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin
</h4>
Following a request from the French delegation, the Commission has asked Member States to consider extending the scope of this Regulation so as to apply it to additional agricultural products and foodstuffs.  The additional suggestions are:<br>
<ul>
<li>salt,
<li>pasta
<li>other processed foods
<li>cochineal
<li>cork
</ul>
<p>
At present the Regulation can be used for the following:
<p>
A. Products for human consumption<br>
fresh meat (and offal); meat-based products (cooked, salted, smoked, etc.); cheeses; other products of animal origin (eggs, honey, milk products excluding butter, etc.)
oils and fats (butter, margarine, oils, etc.); fruits, vegetables, cereals, whether or not processed; fish, molluscs, fresh crustaceans and ...-based products; other Annex II products (spices, etc.).
<p>
B. Foodstuffs listed in Annex I to Regulation 2081/92<br>
beer; natural mineral waters and spring waters; beverages made from plant extracts; bread, pastry, cakes, confectionery, biscuits and other baker's wares; natural gums and resins.
<p>
C  Agricultural Products listed in Annex II to Regulation 2081/92<br>
hay; essential oils.

<a name="96-1"></a><h4>EU Food Sampling Programme 1996 : Commission Recommendation of 17th April 1996 Concerning a Coordinated Programme for the Official Control of Foodstuffs for 1996 (96/290/EC) (OJ L109/24, 3.5.96)
</h4>
The Commission has published its requirements for the 1996 coordinated sampling programme as provided for by the Official Control of Foodstuffs Directive (89/397/EEC).
<p>
For 1996, the Commission is requesting Member States to sample the following.  Suggestions are made for the methods of sampling and analysis.  Although sampling rates have not been set Member States are recommended to ensure that the number of samples taken is sufficient to provide an overview of the subject under consideration in each Member State.  Example record sheets are provided in the Official Journal to ease comparability of the results
<p>
<ol>
<li>Microbiological assessment of dried and fermented ready-to-eat meats and meat products.<p>
These products are to be sampled at the point of retail sale.  The samples are to be subjected to microbiological examination for the presence of Salmonellae, E.coli 0157:H7 and enumeration of Staphlococcus aureus.  The products pH and water activity are to be noted.  The results are to be recorded in 3 categories:  dry and semi-dry sausage, undried sausage and raw (country-style) hams.<p>
<li>Migration of Plasticizers.<p>
Limits on the amount of plasticizers (substances added to plastic to enhance their suppleness) permitted to migrate to foods are specified in Directive 90/128/EEC.  They contribute a high level to the overall migration of substances from plasticized plastics into foods.  These samples will assess compliance with the legal limits.<p>
<li>Temperature control of chilled foods on sale to the final consumer.<p>
The Directive on the hygiene of foodstuffs (93/43/EEC) requires foods which are likely to support the growth of pathogenic micro-organisms  or the formation of toxins to be kept at temperatures which would not result in a risk to health.  The programme is to look at 4 categories of foods to assess their temperatures at the point of sale.  The categories are:<br>

<ul>
<li>chilled cooked foods to be eaten without further reheating;
<li>chilled cooked foods requiring reheating only (not a full cooking process) prior to consumption;
<li>raw prepared foods to be eaten after a full heat process;
<li>raw preepared foods to be eaten raw.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Benzo(a)pyrene in smoked pork products.<p>
The Directive on flavourings (88/388/EEC) has set maximum limits on the levels of the smoked aroma substance 3,4 benzo-pyrene in foodstuffs.  Checks are to be conducted to assess the levels of the substance in smoked port products.
</ol><p>

<h4>Mycotoxins - EC Permitted Levels</h4>

The EC Commission has been having discussions for some time with regard to setting limits for mycotoxins for certain foods.  The letter reported on continuing discussions, particularly resulting from a meeting on the 28 May 1996 when a revised working document was discussed.
<p>
The document assumes “ideal sampling and optimal methods of analysis, to be agreed at a later date” which caused the UK delegation some concern that values were being discussed in isolation from these issues.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Aflatoxins: levels are being proposed in the working document for groundnuts, cereals, dried fruits and milk.  Dried fruits may be listed separately; spices may be added.
<li>Ochratoxin A: cereals and cereal products and raw coffee are presently listed but this may be modified to cereals, raw coffee and processed coffee.
<li>Patulin:  A limit is proposed for the following apple products - apple juice, cider, puree.
</ul><p>
Most Member States appear to favour these controls and do not have the reservations which the UK have with regard to the practical and financial consequences of an excessively regulatory approach.  Discussions will continue as the Commission further develops the proposal.

<h4>BST</h4>

The use of bovine somatotropin (BST), a growth hormone that increases milk production by cows, remains illegal in the EU, following a decision taken by the Commission last week.  The Commission rejected a request by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly to include BST in the list of substances that can be used in veterinary medical products administered to food-producing animals.  In December 1994 the Council of Ministers agreed a ban on the placing on the market of BST until 31 December 1999.

<h4>Pesticide Residues - Amendments adopted</h4>

On the 21 May 1996, the Council adopted amendments to two directives that set the maximum residues limits for pesticides in fruit and vegetables, cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin.  The amendments adjust the controls to take into account new compounds and new data and to extend the controls to certain additional foods.
<p>
Directive 96/32 amends Annex II to Directive 76/895 (relating to fruits and vegetables) and Annex II to Directive 90/642 (relating to certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables).  Directive 96/33 amends the Annexes to Directives 86/362 (relating to cereals) and Directive 86/363 (relating to foodstuffs of animal origin).
<p>
Both Directives should be implemented by Member States by the 30 April 1997.

<p>
<h4>Hygiene Measures - Progress Towards Consolidation</h4>

Anyone who has had to grapple with the complexity of the European hygiene controls on products of animal origin will appreciate that greater coherence and transparency is this area is long overdue.  On 19 April 1996, the Agriculture Directorate-General (DGVI) produced a document (of about 150 pages) described as "A Guide to certain rules governing production, marketing and importation of products of animal origin intended for human consumption".  This has been described as "an aid to reading existing legislation and to reflection on how to improve it".  It is however written in a form which could be used as a consolidating directive.  It would replace and repeal 13 directives covering hygiene of such foods as fresh meat, poultry meat, dairy products, eggs, snails, etc.
<br>
Although the concept of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is presently only included in the Directives on fish and milk, the Guide indicates that it could become a key part of the total control system for all these products areas. It does not incorporate any aspects of the General Food Hygiene Directive (93/43).  The Commission is hloding discussions with key gropus of interested parties and has invited comments on the document.

<h4>Council Directive No 96/21 amending Commission Directive 94/54/EC concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112.
</h4>
The Directive was adopted on the 29 March 1996 and supplements the labelling requirements for foods containing sweeteners so as to provide consumers with more specific information about the presence and effect of sweeteners in a food.<p>

In particular:<br>
(a) foods containing sweeteners (as permitted by Directive 94/35) shall be labelled "with sweetener(s)" with the name of the food;<br>
(b) foods containing both added sugar and sweeteners shall be labelled "with sugar(s) and sweeteners" with the name of the food;<br>
(c) foods containing aspartame shall include on the label the statement "contains a source of phenylalanine"<br>
(d) foods containing more than 10% added polyols shall include on the label the statement "excessive consumption may produce laxative effects".<p>

The directive should be fully implemented by 1 July 1987<p>
