If you are interested in using rock dust and its many applications then
I would highly suggest that you subscribe to Remineralize the Earth
available at Remin@aol.com.
cost is $15 for three issues since it is published three times per
year!
You can also call them at 1-413-586-4429
Being a hardened rock dust man , I was delighed to find these folks and
their information on remineralization of the earth. For more info on
these folks see their web page at
Here are some of my personal experiences with rock dust. See also my
rock dust page

                            <STRONG><H1> Rock Me Baby!</H1></STRONG>
     I  first  started  using rock dust very early in my  childhood.  I
started  gardening on my grand parents farm in PR and in Cuba,  and  in
Costa Rica. As a child I started using finely ground sand or dust as  a
way to control bugs from attacking my plants. I noticed that by dusting
my vegetables and flowers that less bugs attacked them. I was not aware
at  the time that I was also feeding them (the plants not the bugs).  I
learned  that  ocean sand was also very effective  against  bugs  so  I
started  using a little ocean sand around the base of the plants  about
two  feet away so not to burn them from the salt in the sand.  I  would
make  a  barrier  around the area  I wanted to keep the  crawling  bugs
out(it  didn't work against the flying ones unless I dusted the  plants
directly).  I  also  learned how to spray sea water on  plants  without
hurting or burning the plants.

     Grinding rocks into a fine powder became an obsession with me.  It
took  many years of trail and error before I finally developed  my  own
grinder  that worked! What I did what turn a fifty gallon drum into  my
grinder.  Inside  I placed a large rock  or several large  round  river
rocks which when the drum was truned would crush the other softer rocks
into a fine rock powder. I hooked the drum to a bicycle and peddled  to
turn the drum. Good exersice too!
     It  wasn't long before I found out that I could get rock dust  for
free  in  large quantites from my local rock quary. So it  wasn't  long
before  I was bagging rock dust and taking it home. There are  so  many
things  that  one can do with a good rock dust that I thought  I  would
make a list and work from there...

     1....Rock Dust controls many diseases! The high mineral levels  is
the  key. Also the high energy levels of the rock dust provides a boost
to the plant or tree or evn the soil! By learning how to best apply the
rock  dust  ,  you  will begin to take giant steps in  the  control  of
fungus,  diseases  as well as many pests can be controled  by  properly
using rock dust.
     2....Rock Dust restores trees to health! The application  of  rock
dust during the spring once per year will encourage the root systems of
trees  ,  lawns, roses, vegetable gardens. Apply rock dust just  before
the rainy season to take advantage of mother natures rain.
     3....Rock Dust  makes a great lawn additive. By applying rock dust
4  times per year once each season if possible otherwise spring, summer
and fall. Apprx 50 lbs should take care of 5,000 sg  ft.
     4......Rock Dust applied to fruit trees in the spring will produce
large abundance of sweet fruit for you come summer!
     5...Roses  love rock dust! Apply rock dust several timesper  year,
apprx 1 cup rock dust per plant, watered in well. For best results  add
1 cup rock dust to 1 gallon filtered water then water base of rose. You
can  also  make a rock dust milk by adding 1 cup rock dust to  a  panty
hose,  tie into a ball and suspend in a gallon of water. Allow  to  sit
over night. Pour into sprayer and spray leaves.
     6..Vegetables love rock dust! Add rock dust to your  gardens  soil
at  least once per year, seasonally would be better if you are able to.
Also apply rock dust as a spray once per month.
     See ya next time!
