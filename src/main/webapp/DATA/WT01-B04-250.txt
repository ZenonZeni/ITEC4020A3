<h3><center>Purpose of the Working Group</h3></center>
     The Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation 
     maintains science support capabilities that enable a broad range of 
     research projects, especially within the US Antarctic Program.  
     Ensuring that these capabilities continue to serve the best interests 
     of the research community requires periodic and open dialog between 
     the earth sciences community and the program manager.  The Antarctic
     Working Group for Geology and Geophysics is an ad hoc body whose role is
     to provide feed-back about current and planned research support
     capabilities available to Antarctic earth science projects supported by the 
     National Science Foundation.  The working group affords a broad conduit for 
     exchange of information between the program manager and the 
     earth-science research community.  The group addresses concerns and 
     priorities within the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics program, making 
     recommendations for action where appropriate.  It also provides a 
     forum to raise and discuss general programmatic issues associated with 
     new opportunities in earth science research as it perceives them, or 
     as they are recognized by the wider earth-science community.<p>
