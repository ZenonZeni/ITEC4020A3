<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Disease Management Programs
Launched
</STRONG></FONT><P>

NYLCare Health Plans recently launched a state-of-the-art disease management
program
for plan
members who suffer from congestive heart failure (CHF). Our partner in the project
is a
company
called Stuart Disease Management Services, based in Wilmington, Delaware.<P>

<STRONG>What is Disease Management?</STRONG>
<P>

The idea behind disease management is simple. There are a number of chronic
diseases
that
doctors know a lot about, have experience treating and for which effective
medicines exist.
Disease management adds patient education and close monitoring of the disease to
what
doctors
already know. Patients are told about their condition and receive instruction about
taking
medication and keeping a close eye on their own health.<P>

<STRONG>About Congestive Heart Failure </STRONG>
<P>
In the case of congestive heart failure, doctors have learned that the disease is
best
treated with lifestyle changes and medication. The lifestyle changes may include
cutting
back
on salt, getting more rest and restricting activities that bring on symptoms of the
disease.<P>

Congestive heart failure refers to a range of conditions which impair the
function of the
heart.  It results in shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles, fatigue, and, at
its most
extreme, fluid in the lungs. The condition may develop over a period of weeks,
months or
years.<P>

Congestive heart failure affects between 2.3 and 3 million people in the U.S., with
400,000
new cases diagnosed each year. It is one of the most frequent causes for
hospitalizing
people aged 65 and older. Currently, treating patients with congestive heart
failure costs an
estimated  billion each year in the United States. The congestive heart failure
disease
management program includes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>strategies for disease prevention and early intervention.
<LI>physician and patient education programs.
<LI>ensuring patients adhere to their doctor's treatment program.
<LI>identifying the drugs that work best.
<LI>measuring the effectiveness of various treatments.
</UL>

<strong>How We Started - Where We're Going</strong><P>

The program started with a pilot CHF management program at participating primary
care
facilities in Long Island, New York, where CHF admissions represented 40% of the
hospitalizations for NYLCare 65 members. Expansion into the rest of New York State,
New
Jersey, Texas and Washington, D.C. will follow. By the end of 1996, the disease
management
program will be available to more than one million members of NYLCare.<P>

The relationship with Stuart Disease Management has produced an excellent program
for
the
management of congestive heart failure in a cost-conscious manner.<P>

The goal for patients in the Congestive Heart Failure Disease Management Program is
to
receive the ultimate benefit for anyone suffering from a chronic disease--an
improved
quality
of life.
