<h3>CENTER OF EXCELLENCE HELPS COMMUNITIES<br>
BECOME MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND</h3>

	The Clinton administration's pledge to protect the environment for future generations while promoting economic development continues to create benefits for all Americans.  The U.S. Department of Energy has established the Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development, a pilot program that will help communities carry out that pledge.  The center will offer information and technical advice to help communities become more energy efficient and environmentally sound.<P>

	The center will provide communities a "tool kit" of workbooks, computer programs and data for guidance on sustainable development projects ranging from "green" buildings to neighborhoods that waste less energy.  Communities can review case studies of successful community projects and research technical and financial programs that can provide further assistance.  Experienced personnel will be on hand to consult with local officials.<P>

	"By offering assistance at the local level, we hope to help communities adopt practices that range from pedestrian walkways to environmentally friendly sources of energy," said Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary.  "Communities with the foresight to adopt sustainable development strategies will find they save taxpayer money, improve the profits and productivity of local businesses and make the community much more liveable."<P>

	The center grew out of DOE's work with Midwest communities devastated by the 1993 floods.  DOE helped the communities rebuild using sustainable development strategies, which integrate economic development and environmental quality goals.  This assistance will be offered nationwide during a six-month demonstration period.<P>

	Two of the towns that benefited from the DOE program after the floods, Pattonsburg, Mo. and Valmeyer, Ill., were honored yesterday by the President's Council on Sustainable Development.  With federal assistance, Pattonsburg is replacing flood-devastated buildings with energy-efficient designs, building better water-quality systems, and creating a new power supply using renewable energy.  Valmeyer also is embracing energy-efficient designs for buildings.
<P>

	The center is an outgrowth of DOE's involvement with the President's Council on Sustainable Development, created in June 1993.  The Council has presented its final report to the President.<P>

	DOE's Denver Regional Support Office will manage the program.  Interested communities can contact the center toll-free at (800) 357-7732 or via the center's Internet home page: "http://www.sustainable.doe.gov."
