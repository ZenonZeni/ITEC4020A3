SUBJECT: Preliminary Analysis of &quot;Clipper III&quot; Encryption Proposal<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
The Administration's latest encryption policy proposal, already dubbed &quot;Clipper
III,&quot; would use a new government-sanctioned certification system as
an incentive to virtually impose key escrow on domestic encryption users.
The draft proposal, &quot;Achieving Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public
Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure,&quot; would establish a
new &quot;public key infrastructure&quot; for encryption. Such a public
key infrastructure would enable users of encryption to clearly identify
the people they are communicating with, and is widely viewed as an important
prerequisite for the widespread use of secure electronic communications.
However, the Clipper III proposal would establish this infrastructure at
a price: All users of the public key infrastructure would have to ensure
government access to their encryption keys through an approved key escrow
agent. <BR>
<BR>
Clipper III will not meet the privacy and security needs of Internet users.
While the proposal represents real progress by the Administration in recognizing
the importance of encryption, in reality it provides few provisions to protect
individual privacy. The proposal is hardly voluntary -- it makes key escrow
a virtual precondition for participation in a secure GII. It targets domestic
users of encryption, contains few guidelines for key exchanges with foreign
governments, and encourages collection of highly sensitive private key information.
Moreover, it contains none of the standards for key holder liability, limits
on access to keys by law enforcement, or audit requirements that many have
already identified as crucial to protecting individual privacy in even a
voluntary key escrow system. For these reasons, CDT believes that the Clipper
III proposal is another step in the wrong direction for U.S. encryption
policy.
<H3>Overview of the Administration Proposal</H3>
Taking a nod from the European Commission's recent Trusted Third Party initiative,
the Clipper III proposal would develop a needed public key infrastructure,
couched in the language of privacy and security, and use it as an incentive
for development of a de facto key escrow system. The Clipper III proposal:
<UL>
<LI>Acknowledges the importance of encryption and the need for a public
key infrastructure (PKI) -- The proposal reaffirms the importance of encryption
and the emerging need for a system to certify public encryption keys. Such
a &quot;public key infrastructure&quot; would allow users to certify to
other users that their public keys in fact belonged to them, allowing the
keys to be used and trusted for encrypted commerce and communication. Without
such a system, &quot;users cannot know with whom they are dealing on the
network, or sending money to, or who signed a document, or if the document
was intercepted and changed by a third party.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#note_1">1</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Establishes a complex new Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) -- The
proposal would form a new public key infrastructure to tie encryption users
to their public keys. The KMI would establish new certification authorities
that would guarantee -- and be held liable for -- the identity of a public
key. The new entities proposed under the Administration plan include:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI>Certification Authorities (CAs) - to identify and issue certificates
to users; 
  <LI>Escrow Authorities (EAs) - to hold private key information as required;
and 
  <LI>Policy Approving Authorities (PAAs) -- overarching bodies, possibly
under governmental control, responsible for certifying trusted escrow authorities.
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI>Requires key escrow as a condition of participation in the new public
key infrastructure -- In order to participate in the new Key Management
Infrastructure, users would be required to ensure law enforcement access
to encrypted information. &quot;One condition of obtaining a certificate
is that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or other information
as appropriate) has been escrowed with a certified escrow authority to allow
access to a user's data or communications.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#note_2">2</A></SUP>
The escrow agent could be the certification authority or another third-party,
so long as they meet &quot;minimum standards&quot; including &quot;performance
criteria to meet law enforcement's needs.&quot; Self-escrow would also be
allowed for entities that meet certain unspecified &quot;necessary performance
requirements.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Relaxes export controls for key escrow products as in Clipper II --
The proposal would &quot;continue and expand&quot; the NIST &quot;Clipper
II&quot; export control provisions proposed this fall, allowing 64 bit software/80
bit hardware exports to any destination if keys are escrowed in the U.S.
or if the U.S. has a bilateral escrow agreement. Other exports to certain
markets would be considered, upon case-by-case review and under certain
conditions. Key length limits would presumably expand as law enforcement
confidence in the key escrow authorities grew. 
</UL>
<H3>Critique and Areas of Concern</H3>
Clipper III does represent a major step forward by the Administration in
acknowledging the importance of encryption and public key cryptography:
&quot;Government can no longer monopolize state of the art cryptography.
... It is unrealistic to believe that government can produce solutions which
keep ahead of today's rapidly changing information technology.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#note_3">3</A></SUP>
The proposal goes on to note that, &quot;[Public key cryptography features]
are needed to support electronic commerce, public services, redefined business
processes, and national security.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, Clipper III is also a clear attempt to force the widespread adoption
of key escrow by leveraging the need of encryption users to participate
in a public key certification system. Major problems with the proposal include:
<UL>
<LI>It makes key escrow a precondition for participation in the public key
infrastructure - Other than law enforcement access, there is no reason the
public key infrastructure must store private keys. On the contrary, the
essential breakthrough of public key cryptography is the ability it gives
users to share public key information and partake fully in authenticated,
secure communications without revealing any private key information to third
parties. Data recovery -- the ability to recover encrypted data if a private
key is lost -- is the main rationale presented for key escrow. However,
data recovery can be done independently of the public key infrastructure
if desired, and in a more secure manner.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It is not voluntary -- Though participation is theoretically &quot;voluntary,&quot;
under Clipper III users will have no choice but to escrow their keys or
forego participation in the Information Age economy. The proposal itself
calls the key infrastructure a &quot;basic and entirely essential foundation.&quot;
To participate, users will need to escrow their keys; if they choose not
to participate in the KMI, users will be unable to obtain the essential
certifications that the Administration foresees as being the standard for
secure electronic communications and commerce. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>It targets domestic users -- While export controls have ostensibly been
aimed at controlling the use of encryption by foreign users, the Clipper
III proposal is clearly aimed at domestic users of encryption.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It leaves international key exchange problems unresolved -- Without
a system of international agreements, interoperability is at risk. The same
encryption and/or authentication scheme exportable to Germany or France
might not be exportable to India or China in the absence of appropriate
bilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements raise their own issues: under
what standards will keys be released to foreign governments, especially
those with no tradition of Fourth Amendment search and seizure protection?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It contains no key escrow privacy provisions -- The Administration proposal
only tangentially addresses the privacy problems posed by key escrow systems.
As others have already noted in the encryption policy debate, any key escrow
system (even if voluntary) raises issues regarding the need for: liability
rules for unauthorized key disclosures by escrow agents; standards for law
enforcement access; auditing requirements for escrow agents; and guidelines
for decryption information access.<SUP><A HREF="#note_4">4</A></SUP> Clipper III contains
no such standards or guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It compromises network security by encouraging storage of private key
information -- Clipper III requires the accumulation of private keys or
other decryption information in dangerous and vulnerable points-of-failure
-- the escrow agents. At the same time as it seeks to design a secure infrastructure,
the proposal builds enormous new vulnerabilities into the system.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It is not responsive to years of feedback from industry and policy advocates
--The proposal answers few of the concerns repeatedly raised by privacy
advocates or industry. It reflects a policy-making process still driven
by national security and law enforcement concerns rather than the privacy
needs of individuals and the security needs of the online economy. 
</UL>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
As the European Commission prepares to release its Trusted Third Party encryption
proposals in Europe, the very similar Clipper III proposal provides a preview
of the choices being made around the world to sacrifice privacy concerns
in the name of law enforcement access. The Administration proposal has the
potential to hold the budding public key infrastructure -- an important
component of secure communications online -- hostage to the demands of law
enforcement. Instead, CDT believes the Administration should use this opportunity
to develop a more secure and trusted communications infrastructure for all
users, even those in countries without the same tradition of Fourth Amendment
protection afforded to U.S. citizens. CDT looks forward to continuing to
work towards voluntary, private-sector security standards for the information
infrastructure independent of escrow requirements or export controls.<BR>

<SUP>4</SUP> Some data recovery or interception mechanisms (e.g., the TIS data recovery
center model, etc.) allow for much less intrusive means of decryption access
than others. For example, if a system provides access to private keys, than
every communication using that key is compromised. The costs of accidental
disclosure are consequently much higher than they need to be, and there
is no ability to narrowly tailor law enforcement requests. To the extent
that key escrow is ever used, standards should be put in place to keep access
to encrypted information as narrowly tailored as possible. <BR>
