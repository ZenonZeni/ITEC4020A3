<p align="left"><font size="4"><tt>Mr. Carl E. Olsen<br>
Post Office Box 4091<br>
Des Moines, Iowa 50333<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Mr. Olsen:</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Thank you for your further correspondence
on the status of illegal drugs in America.&nbsp; I appreciate
your opinions, but I have not been pursuaded to change my stance
on the legalization of illicit drugs.&nbsp; Drugs are illegal
because they are dangerous.&nbsp; Drugs are not dangerous because
they are illegal.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In your most recent letter, you present the
following arguments: There is no hope for winning the battle against
illegal drug use, drug use is a medical problem and should be
treated as such, illegal drugs are less harmful than alcohol and
tobacco and therefore should be legalized, and if drugs were
legalized, then the price of illegal drugs would drop as well as
the crime associated with illegal drugs.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Enclosed you will find a copy of a floor </tt></font><a
href="grassley2.html"><font size="4"><tt>statement</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> that I made on the 23 of January to address these,
as well as other arguments made by those who favor
legalization.&nbsp; I believe you will find all of your concerns
addressed there.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>I would like to update certain points with
additional information that has been released since this
statement was made.&nbsp; On April 25, 1996, the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse released a study that confirmed
what many had all ready suspected.&nbsp; Marijuana users are 79
times as likely as those who do not use marijuana to go on to harder
drugs.&nbsp; This is an alarming statistic, and the first time
that anyone has proven the statistical link between marijuana and
other drugs.&nbsp; To compare, the first studies that raised
alarms about the dangers of smoking indicated that those who
smoked were nine to ten times more likely to develop lung cancer
than those who did not.&nbsp; And those who drank alcohol were
three to four times as likely to develop cirrhosis of the liver
as those who did not.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>You have also contacted me in support of
the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; I would like
to mention some additional information for you to consider.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Let me say at the outset that I am opposed
to the use of marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; There have
been over 12,000 published scientific studies of marijuana, none
of which have shown smoking marijuana to be a safe or effective
medicine for the treatment of any condition.&nbsp; The most
recent comprehensive study was ordered by the U.S. Public Health
Service and completed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
in March of 1992.&nbsp; The report concluded that marijuana has
never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine, and that
there are better and safer drugs for all of the conditions that
were considered.&nbsp; Let me share with you some further history
of this issue.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Before 1906, when the Pure Food and Drug
Act was passed, placing regulations on the sale and manufacture
of medicine, the prevailing attitude was one of &quot;let the buyer
beware.&quot;&nbsp; Before this, many medicines were touted as the
cure-all for a wide variety of ailments.&nbsp; These unlabeled
and uncontrolled medicines, sometimes pushed by unscrupulous
doctors, often did more harm than good.&nbsp; Often, these snake
oil medicines contained addictive substances, such as cocaine,
marijuana, or morphine, turning their unwitting customer into an
addict who would then clamor for more because it made him
&quot;feel better.&quot;</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In an effort to protect the public from the
potentially harmful effects of such &quot;medicines,&quot; the
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was passed.&nbsp; These laws were
written to ensure that no substance is marketed as medicinal
until it has been proven to be both safe and effective.&nbsp; In addition,
all ingredients must be listed on the label.&nbsp; In 1938, the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act established the Food and Drug
Administration and gave the FDA the authority and responsibility
to require that manufacturers prove their products' safety.&nbsp;
The role of the FDA was expanded in 1962 to include both the
safety and efficacy of products under their jurisdiction.&nbsp;
It is important to note that marijuana has never been shown
scientifically to be a safe or effective medicine for the
treatment of any condition.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In order for a drug to be approved as a
medicine, it must meet several strict requirements to ensure
safety standards.&nbsp; The process for approval begins with a
study of a drug's chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology.&nbsp; Because
marijuana is not a stable substance, especially when it is
smoked, the varying, complex mixture of chemicals is extremely
difficult to study.&nbsp; Many of the chemical combinations are
known to be harmful, while other components have yet to be
studied.&nbsp; New chemical components are still being
discovered.&nbsp; Some of the known chemical combinations include
hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde,
acetone, phenol, cresol, naphthalene, and other well-known
carcinogens such as benzpyrene, benzanthracene, benzene, and
nitrosamine.&nbsp; These carcinogens have been found to be the
cancer causing agents in tobacco smoke, and are present in higher concentrations
in marijuana smoke than tobacco smoke.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Next, the chemical reactions that occur
when a drug is taken must be known and reproducible for the FDA
to consider approving a drug.&nbsp; Dosages must be measurable to a
high degree of accuracy.&nbsp; This is necessary to determine what,
if any, interactions may occur if the drug being tested is taken
in combination with other medicines, as well as the effects of
higher or lower dosage rates.&nbsp; I know that there is a lot of
anecdotal information around indicating that marijuana helps some
people, but this is not generally true.&nbsp; And we need to be
careful when we make decisions about drugs and the claims some
people make for them.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>So where do the claims that marijuana is
beneficial for persons suffering from glaucoma, AIDS, Multiple
Sclerosis, and other ailments come from?&nbsp; Just as there is a
powerful tobacco lobby, there is a well-financed and
well-organized marijuana legalization lobby.&nbsp; Many of the
same claims and tactics that were used in tobacco advertizing
campaigns are now being used for marijuana legalization.&nbsp;
Groups such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) have stated that the issue of medicinal uses for
marijuana will be used in an attempt to give marijuana a good
name.&nbsp; Similar tactics were used by the tobacco industry
before the Federal Trade Commission halted the practice in
1955.&nbsp; 'Camel' cigarettes were advertized as an aid for
digestion and said to prevent fatigue.&nbsp; 'Kool' brand
cigarettes claimed to prevent the common cold.&nbsp; Similar to
the way that the tobacco industry works to undermine the efforts
of the FDA, NORML supports initiatives at both state and federal
levels to circumvent current consumer protection laws, such as
the guidelines for establishing marijuana as a legal drug.&nbsp;
Just as the tobacco industry has denied that tobacco is addictive
and causes cancer, the marijuana legalization movement denies the
harmful effects of marijuana.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Still, many ill people claim that using
marijuana has made their illnesses easier.&nbsp; </tt><i><tt>But
science does not support these claims.</tt></i><tt>&nbsp; The
National Eye Institute has reported that the intraocular
pressure-lowering action of marijuana is not effective enough to
prevent optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma.&nbsp; As of June,
1994, there are 24 agents, all approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, that are incorporated into a variety of medicines
to be used for glaucoma treatment.&nbsp; There are also surgical options
available.&nbsp; Studies performed in the early l970s showed that
marijuana, when smoked, did lower the intraocular pressure in
people with normal pressure and in those with glaucoma.&nbsp;
However, follow-up studies, conducted over a ten year period,
(1978 - 1988) by the National Eye Institute showed that although
marijuana -- or more specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) -- did lower intraocular pressure when administered, none of
the studies showed that marijuana, or any of its components,
could safely and effectively lower intraocular pressure enough to
prevent optic nerve damage.&nbsp; In addition, these studies
showed that marijuana had a number of undesirable and potentially
harmful side effects, such as elevated blood pressure, dry eye,
euphoria, as well as a greater risk for respiratory system
damage.&nbsp; These are in addition to the psychological side
effects.&nbsp; According to a fact sheet released by the
Department of Health and Human Services, entitled </tt><i><tt>National
Eye Institute Fact Sheet on the Therapeutic Use of Marijuana for
Glaucoma</tt></i><tt>, &quot;The availability of a wide variety
of alternative treatments that do not have marijuana's
psychoactive and other specific side effects argues against the
use of marijuana for treating glaucoma.&nbsp; Marijuana offers no
advantage over currently available glaucoma drugs and indeed may
be less effective than these agents.&quot;</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Marijuana supporters have also endorsed its
use for AIDS patients with wasting syndrome.&nbsp; This syndrome
is characterized by severely debilitating anorexia and weight loss,
and is of particular concern because it can exacerbate the
primary illness and is associated with a poor prognosis.&nbsp;
Marijuana is said to be beneficial because it increases the
patient's appetite and decreases nausea that sometimes occurs as
a result of other medications.&nbsp; However, according to
researchers, marijuana smoking also causes a number of problems,
causing more harm than good.&nbsp; </tt><i><tt>Marijuana has also
been shown to suppress the body's natural immune system, which is
especially dangerous to persons with the HIV virus or AIDS.</tt></i><tt>&nbsp;
Smokers have about half the life expectancy of non-smokers, and have
an increased incidence of pneumonia when compared to non-marijuana
smokers.&nbsp; Drug absorption from marijuana smoking is
dependent upon deep inhalation of marijuana smoke, an impractical
suggestion for non-smoking patients or those with limited lung
capacity because of illness (such as pneumonia).&nbsp; Also,
there currently is a synthetic form of THC, called
&quot;Marinol&quot; available as an anti-nausea agent for
patients who have failed to respond to other drugs.&nbsp; Unlike
marijuana, Marinol has met and passed all of the testing and
regulations that the FDA requires.&nbsp; The medical use of
Marinol is highly restricted because of the potential side
effects.&nbsp; Fortunately, newer, better anti-emetic medications
have been developed and are now available.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Because of a placebo effect, a patient may
believe a drug is helpful when it is not.&nbsp; Anecdotal
evidence may point to a drug having medicinal value, but this
needs to be followed up with scientific studies.&nbsp; Because of marijuana's
addictive and mind-altering effects, a placebo effect can be
magnified.&nbsp; Users are likely to exaggerate the
benefits.&nbsp; For example, there have been numerous reports
from patients that have claimed that marijuana has cause
improvement in multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; However, a controlled,
scientific study by Dr. H. S. Greenberg, reported in </tt><i><tt>Clinical
Pharmacology &amp; Therapy</tt></i><tt> (Vol. 55:324-328, 1994)
showed that smoking marijuana actually made the symptoms of
multiple sclerosis worse.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In addition, many reports of marijuana's
beneficial effects are based not on science but on anecdotes from individuals
who claim results for themselves.&nbsp; While these individuals
may feel they have benefited, we cannot base public policy
decisions on important issues on anecdotal information.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, many in the press and elsewhere do not look beyond
such information.&nbsp; The best available science, however,
clearly and overwhelmingly demonstrates the contrary.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>I hear from many thoughtful persons, such
as yourself, who urge me to consider supporting marijuana for
medical use.&nbsp; I have looked at the copious research that has
been done on this issue and urge you to do so as well.&nbsp; For
a further discussion on the therapeutic uses of marijuana, there
are a number of reports that examine the available scientific
information.&nbsp; &quot;Health Aspects of Cannabis,&quot; written
by Leo E. Hollister and published in </tt><i><tt>Pharmacological
Reviews</tt></i><tt> (Vol. 38, No. 1:1986) is an excellent
starting point.&nbsp; Numerous other studies have also been
published in </tt><i><tt>The New England Journal of Medicine</tt></i><tt>, </tt><i><tt>The
Lancet</tt></i><tt>, and other reputable medical journals as well as
those available from NIH and the FDA.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In closing, I want to relay to you my
strong feelings about representative government.&nbsp; For
democracy to function, there has to be two-way communication
between Americans and their elected representatives.&nbsp; By
sharing your views with me, Iowans play a vital role in this process.&nbsp;
Hearing from you enables me to be a better U.S. Senator, and I
very much appreciate the time you took to inform me of your
concerns.&nbsp; Thanks again for keeping in touch.</tt></font></p>
