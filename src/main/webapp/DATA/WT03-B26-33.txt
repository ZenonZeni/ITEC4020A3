<BR>
About 100 specialists in Earth observation data and applications met in
Hatoyama, near Tokyo, on 25&shyp;26 January 1996, for the Third General
Meeting of the Global Research Network System. GRNS is a special 5-year
program, funded by the Science and Technology Agency of Japan and managed
by the National Space Development Agency, with participation from several
countries and organisations, mainly in the Asia&shyp;Pacific region. <BR>
<BR>
The program's objectives are to: 
<UL>
<LI>produce fundamental data sets in key areas of Earth science (including
vegetation, oceanography, desertification, and hydrology), with an emphasis
on the Asia&shyp;Pacific region; 
<LI>improve understanding of data-set management , including base map referencing
and data integration; 
<LI>support international research efforts in global change; and 
<LI>create a human and information network among research institutes in
the region.

<P>An international steering committee, with experts from Japan, the USA
(NASA, NOAA), Thailand (UNEP/GRID) and Italy (European Space Agency) helps
to guide the program, which comprises research and data projects carried
out by institutions in Australia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan.

The Australia/Japan collaborative agreement is co-ordinated by AUSLIG (Australian
Surveying and Land Information Group) and NASDA, respectively. Researchers
and data project managers from the following Australian organisations take
part in GRNS, and attended the recent meeting: 
<UL>
<LI>Australian Institute of Marine Science (Coral reef studies) 
<LI>Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (Program management
and data set standardisation) 
<LI>Bureau of Meteorology (Hydrology) 
<LI>CSIRO Division of Fisheries (Ocean Colour studies) 
<LI>CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications/Earth Observation Centre
(Ocean Colour studies) 
<LI>CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology (Vegetation and Desertification
studies). <BR>
