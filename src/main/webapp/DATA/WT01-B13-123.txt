The U.S. dollar has eased against both the Japanese yen and German mark since January because of a mixture of economic and political factors.
<P>

<B>First, there are signs that the U.S. investors are exporting capital aggressively again.</B> In January, retail investors purchased almost $8 billion of international funds or the highest level since early 1994. If these trends were to be sustained, total capital outflows from the U.S. during 1996 could rise to $150-200 billion at annual rates. During 1995, U.S. investors purchased foreign equities at a rate of $4.1 billion during the first quarter, $10.2 billion during the second quarter, and $21.5 billion during the third quarter compared to $47 billion during 1994 and $63 billion during 1993. American demand for foreign bonds also has been expanding. In 1995, U.S. investors purchased foreign bonds at a rate of $3.8 billion during the first quarter, $12.7 billion during the second quarter and $13.8 billion during the third quarter. Pension capital outflows have been steady at about $35 billion per annum during recent years but retail investment demand for foreign securities has fluctuated in a wide range.
<P>

In 1995, the growing U.S. demand for foreign securities was offset by foreign purchases of American securities by both private and official investors. Foreign investors bought U.S. equities at a rate of $5.8 billion during the second quarter and $5.2 billion during the third quarter after selling $3.5 billion during the first quarter. Foreign investors were much more enthusiastic buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds last year. Their purchases were $32.9 billion during the first quarter, $43.5 billion during the second quarter, and $46.9 billion during the third quarter. A large share of these purchases were probably official intervention to support the dollar. Japan, for example, purchased $31.4 billion of U.S. government securities during the first three quarters of 1995 despite a cautious attitude towards the dollar by Tokyo's big life insurance companies. But the U.S. bond market rally also attracted many foreign buyers to corporate bonds, not just government securities. Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds were $14.4 billion during the first quarter, $13.1 billion during the second quarter, and $13.2 billion during the third quarter. The problem for the U.S. capital account during 1996 is that American equity values are high relative to the rest of the world while the U.S. bond market is unlikely to produce returns as attractive as those which occurred during 1995. <B>There is also far more human and organizational infrastructure on Wall Street promoting foreign investment than ever before in American history.</B> The U.S. now has 367 international equity funds compared to 196 in 1993, 95 in 1990, and only 13 in 1984. The number of global equity funds has also expanded to 167 from 99 in 1992 and 16 in 1984. While global bond funds have attracted less money than international equity funds, their number also has expanded to 145 from 87 in 1992 and only 1 in 1984. As a result of the growth of America's international fund management industry and the significant out-performance of Wall Street compared to many foreign markets during recent years, American demand for foreign securities during 1996 could be much higher than foreign private demand for U.S. securities.
<P>

The second factor which has depressed the dollar during recent weeks has been seasonal repatriation of capital to Japan and investor concerns about the Bank of Japan shifting away from its easy monetary policy. The new finance minister recently stated that the yields on pensioners' bank deposits were excessively low. New data for industrial production and retail sales also suggest that the Japanese economy has bottomed and begun to recover. As a result of these developments, the futures market is now suggesting that the Bank of Japan could raise short-term interest rates this summer despite the severe asset quality problems of many Japanese banks. The slump in interest rates futures and rally in the yen has become self-reinforcing during recent weeks by encouraging many foreign borrowers of yen, such as hedge funds, to reduce their yen liabilities. As a result, the Bank of Japan has intervened on a large scale during recent weeks in order to persuade investors that they will not permit the seasonal pressures for a stronger yen to go too far.
<P>

<B>As a result of the problems of the Japanese banking system, it is very doubtful that there will be any new monetary tightening in the near future but the yen could still hold in a trading range of 103 to 107 because of political factors, not just divergences in monetary cycles and business conditions.</B> In January, U.S. manufacturing firms began to complain about dollar appreciation while the primary victories of Patrick Buchanan are reviving political focus on the trade deficit after a period in which it faded from Washington radar screens. Recent Japanese import and export data are also calling into question how much further the trade surplus will contract if the yen stays in a range of 100-110. Many Japanese firms are profitable at yen rates of 100-110 and their exports would probably rise sharply if the yen fell back to 110-120. As recently as three months ago, by contrast, many analysts were suggesting the trade surplus would fall sharply if the yen simply held at 105 to the dollar. Persistence of a large Japanese trade surplus is potentially bullish for world financial markets because it provides a source of surplus liquidity but the yen will not weaken dramatically if the surplus remains at high levels or expands further unless Japanese investors export capital far more aggressively. Japanese investors have been boosting their purchases of Australian and European bonds during recent months but they continue to be cautious towards the dollar. Recent political developments in the U.S. will probably reinforce this caution, especially if Mr. Buchanan goes into the Republican convention with a third or more of the delegates.
<P>

The third factor which has depressed the dollar is global bond yield differentials. The German mark has rallied against the dollar because German bond yields have backed up as much as U.S. bond yields during recent weeks while the German economy is so weak that most investors expect further Bundesbank easing. At present, Germany is offering nominal bond yields of 6.2% with a prospective inflation rate of 1.5-2.0% while U.S. bond yields are 6.4% despite a prospective inflation rate closer to 3.0%. French and British real long-term interest rates are also 4.0-5.0% on the basis of current bond yields and prospective inflation performance. These yield differentials have helped to boost investor demand for European currencies.
<P>

In the second quarter, several factors could help to encourage stronger demand for the dollar.
<P>

First, the U.S. economy should improve and lessen investor concern about the risk of a recession depressing corporate profits.
<P>

Secondly, the repatriation of capital to Japan should slow, if not reverse, while many investment institutions may respond to the start of the new fiscal year by diversifying more of their portfolios into foreign securities. Recent proposals to shift a large share of pension fund assets to non-life insurance company managers also should set the stage at some point for larger capital outflows from Japan.
<P>


Thirdly, European currencies could suffer during the second quarter from investor concern about the Russian presidential election in June. The opinion polls suggest that the most likely winner is the communist candidate, Mr. Gennady Zyuganov. He has tired to reassure foreign investors that he will not reverse recent economic reforms but most Russian liberals believe that he is a front man for members of the old Nomenklatura who will do significant damage to Russia's emerging market economy. Mr. Zyuganov's party also favors restoring stronger links with the former Republics of the Soviet Union and opposing the entry of the countries of eastern Europe into NATO. As the IMF recently provided Mr. Boris Yeltsin with a $9 billion loan and he still controls the machinery of government, it is possible that he will be able to make a comeback in time for the election. But as a result of his health problems and low level of public approval, investors will have to assign a high risk to the probability of either Mr. Zyuganov winning the election or Mr. Yeltsin inventing some political excuse to delay the election (such as new military action in the Chechen Republic or a sudden decision to merge Belarus back into Russia). The first major test of market perceptions of the Russian political situation will come in April when Morgan Guaranty plans to offer a Russian Eurobond to foreign investors. If the Eurobond offering goes well, the foreign exchange market may conclude that investors are already discounting a Zyuganov victory. But as Russia has not had an open election for its head of state since 1613, it is difficult to believe that the coming presidential election will not produce some news events potentially damaging to the currencies of the countries close to Russia, including the German mark.
<P>

<B>To summarize,</B> the large rise in U.S. bond yields since late January appears to reflect a mixture of economic and political factors, including the decreased risk of a full scale recession, new pessimism about the prospects for a fiscal compromise in Washington and investor anxiety about what fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries portends for this November's presidential and congressional elections. Investors are especially concerned that Patrick Buchanan's success could help to set the stage for the election of a Democratic House majority which would then embrace themes such as economic nationalism and greater federal regulation of the labor market. The firmer tone to retail sales since January suggests the U.S. economy should soon complete its inventory adjustment and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter. But if bond yields continue to rise in response to America's new political risks, the upturn in housing could stall and depress consumer spending on furniture and appliances at a time when fiscal policy will be restrictive and monetary policy will be the primary engine for restoring growth. Rising bond yields also could depress equity prices after a market rally so broad based that U.S. corporations now have a market capitalization of $6.6 trillion or a level equal to 87.5% of GDP compared to a previous peak of 81.0% of GDP in 1929.
