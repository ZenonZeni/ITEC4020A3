<b><font size="+1">PROGESTERONE for Endometriosis and Ovarian Cysts</font></b><p>
Natural progesterone can bring relief to women’s health conditions, such as endometriosis and ovarian cysts, by helping to restore proper hormone balance, says John R. Lee, M.D., a leading women’s health expert and educator.<p>

<b>ENDOMETRIOSIS.</b><p>
In this condition, the cells of the lining of the uterus (called endometrium) become established elsewhere, such as in the Fallopian tubes, uterine muscles, colon, bladder, and sides of the pelvic cavity. During menstruation, these displaced cells swell with blood and bleed, causing pain and inflammation. <p>
According to Dr. Lee, natural progesterone can stop the spread of endometrial cells by blocking the activity of estrogen which otherwise stimulates the growth of these aberrant cells. Dr. Lee suggests using natural progesterone cream from days 6 to 26 of the monthly cycle, stopping just before menstruation begins. After 4-6 months of this treatment, the monthly pains and bleeding due to endometriosis will usually subside, he says.<p>

<b>OVARIAN CYSTS.</b><p>
Cysts result from a failed or disordered ovulation due to hormonal imbalances, says Dr. Lee. After the cyst forms, during the monthly surge of luteinizing hormone (LH, which promotes ovulation and the transformation of the follicle into the corpus luteum which produces progesterone), it swells and stretches the ovarian membrane, and can cause pain and bleeding.<p>
Natural progesterone, given before ovulation, can inhibit the levels of LH and in effect block ovulation as both ovaries “think” the other one has released an egg, says Dr. Lee. He recommends taking natural progesterone from day 10 to 26 of the cycle. Within 1-2 cycles, as the cyst is no longer stimulated, it will “very likely shrink and disappear without further treatment.”<p>
Dr. Lee prefers transdermal natural progesterone (which means it is “absorbed through the skin”) in cream or oil formulation, because it is absorbed more efficiently and the effect lasts longer, without the emotional highs and lows from oral drops. A woman addressing endometriosis or ovarian cysts will probably need to use anywhere from 1/8 to 1/2 teaspoon of cream per day or 3-10 drops of oil, says Dr. Lee. The cream may be applied to the palms, face, neck, upper chest, breast, inside of the arms, or behind the knees.<p>
The key criterion is the amount of progesterone (in milligrams) contained in a given natural progesterone product. Under healthy conditions, a premenopausal woman’s system produces about 20 mg daily of progesterone between days 15 and 26 of the cycle. While amounts in the range of 20-30 mg daily are often sufficient, relief from the primary symptoms will indicate a woman is taking the appropriate dosage. <p>

<b>BREAST CANCER.</b><p>
If surgery for breast cancer is medically unavoidable, choosing the time in a woman’s menstrual cycle for the operation can make a crucial difference in its success. A study of 289 premenopausal women undergoing mastectomy or lumpectomy revealed that those who had the surgery between days 18 and 20 of their cycle fared the best, with a 76% better survival rate (up to 18 years of follow-up) than women having surgery during days 3 to 12 of their cycle. <p>
The difference is progesterone. Its levels increase steadily as the menstrual cycle progresses, but especially after ovulation until about day 23. The desirable level of progesterone was placed at 4 nanograms/ml. Matching surgery to menstrual cycles doubles the survival rate for cancers involving the lymph nodes.<p>

<b>CROHN’S DISEASE.</b><p>
The use of fish oil supplements can produce a dramatic reduction in the number of flare-ups of Crohn’s disease (recurrent intestinal inflammation), according to researchers at the University of Bologna in Italy. Working with 78 patients classified as high risk for a Crohn’s relapse, the researchers gave them 500 mg of marine lipid concentrate fish oil containing 40% eicosapentaenoic acid and 20% docosahexaenoic acid, for a daily total of 2.7 g of these fatty acids. The capsules were specially coated so that they would not dissolve until they reached the patient’s small intestine and would not produce unpleasant side effects such as heartburn or belching. The study lasted one year.<p>
In the control group, which received a placebo, 69% had a relapse, but in the fish oil group, only 28% had a Crohn’s flare-up during the year. At the end of this year, 59% of those in the fish oil group were still in remission compared to only 26% in the control group.<p>

<b>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.</b><p>
Self-guided relaxation techniques can be a quick and effective way to lower the blood pressure in men and women, according to researchers at the National Taiwan University in Taiwan. High blood pressure (hypertension) is widespread there with 27% of men and 13% of women having readings of at least 140/90. <p>
Based on a study group of 590 individuals with high blood pressure, Taiwanese researchers found that practicing progressive relaxation techniques (from a taped cassette) coupled with home study of healthful practices led to an average drop of blood pressure to 130/85 after 2 months. No drugs or other treatments were involved other than the power of self-directed relaxation.<p>

<b>MIGRAINES.</b><p>
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) can reduce the number of migraine “attacks” by more than two-thirds, according to a study involving 49 individuals with recurrent migraines. They took 400 mg daily of vitamin B2 with breakfast for 3 months. At the end of this period, the number of migraine episodes was reduced by 67% and their severity was decreased by 68%.<p>
Once a migraine has started, intravenous magnesium can quickly reduce its intensity and pain. When 40 individuals with acute migraine symptoms received an intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate (1 g, given over 5 minutes), 35 experienced a 50% reduction in headache pain within 15 minutes. For 18 patients, the pain relief lasted for at least 24 hours.<p>

<b>GET ANXIETY RELIEF WITH AROMATHERAPY</b><p>
Chronic anxiety can contribute to many health problems, but aromatherapy has a quick and simple method for reducing it, according to aromatherapist Valerie Ann Worwood in her new guide, The Fragrant Mind. Aromatherapy works with the essential oils of plants, prepared in any of the following ways, says Worwood: blend with 1 ounce of base oil to make a massage oil; add to bath water; gently heat in a room diffuser; or inhale from a tissue.<p>
<ul>
 <li>Tense Anxiety—Symptoms include bodily tension, muscle pains, aches, and a generalized soreness. Mix clary sage (10 drops), lavender (15 drops), and Roman chamomile (5 drops).<p>
 <li>Restless Anxiety—Here one feels dizzy, sweaty, overactive, with palpitations, the sense of a lump in the throat, frequent urination, diarrhea, or upset stomach. Worwood recommends vetiver (5 drops), juniper (10 drops), and cedarwood (15 drops).<p>
 <li>Apprehensive Anxie-ty—Symptoms generally include worrying, brooding, unease, a sense of foreboding, even paranoia. For relief of this emotional state, try mixing bergamot (15 drops), lavender (5 drops), and geranium (10 drops).<p>
 <li>Repressed Anxiety—This variant of anxiety involves feeling on edge, concentration difficulties, irritability, insomnia, or a sense of chronic exhaustion. Worwood advises a blend of neroli (10 drops), rose otto (10 drops), and bergamot (10 drops).<p>

<a name="Fluoride"></a>
<b>CHILDREN’S HEALTH</b><br>
<b><i>Think Twice about Fluoride Toothpastes and Antidepressants</i></b><p>
Researchers at the University of Connecticut studied 460 children, aged 10-13, who had lived the first 8 years of their lives in a community that did not fluoridate public water supplies. Of the children who received fluoride supplements through toothpaste between ages 2-8, there was an 8 times higher incidence of enamel fluorosis after the second year. <p>
This condition indicates chronic fluoride poisoning and shows up as mottled, pitted teeth. More brushing with fluoride toothpaste at an early age only makes it worse. Children who started brushing their teeth twice daily at ages 1-2 had 4 times more fluorosis than children brushing once daily after age 2, according to the American Journal of Epidemiology (April 1996). The study strongly contradicts the popular notion that fluoride has health benefits for children.<p>
Regarding antidepressants, scientists reviewing the results of 5 clinical studies declared that tricyclic antidepressants such as  imipramine, desipramine, Prozac, Dista, and others, are little better than placebos at relieving childhood depression. They found that such medications brought relief in only 8%-45% of children while placebos (containing no active ingredients) actually helped more children, in the range of 17%-68%, according to Professional Psychology: Research and Practice (1996).<p>

<b>LIFT DEPRESSION WITHOUT PROZAC</b><p>
An estimated 12 million people worldwide (6 million Americans) take Prozac for depression, resulting in annual sales of $2 billion for Eli Lilly and Company, Prozac’s maker. Why further enrich this drug company when safer, inexpensive alternatives exist to successfully elevate your mood? According to naturopathic physician and educator, Michael T. Murray, N.D., lifestyle, dietary, and psychological therapies can serve as natural antidepressants and keep you Prozac free.<p>
<ul>
 <li>Lifestyle—First, make sure your depression does not have an organic, physiological cause, such as diabetes, cancer, or heavy metal toxicity, or is due to a food allergy or overuse of prescription drugs. Then know that it is highly beneficial to create a mental attitude that is positive and optimistic, says Dr. Murray. Set achievement goals, practice affirmations. Quit smoking, reduce or eliminate your intake of caffeine and alcohol, exercise regularly, practice a relaxation and stress reduction exercise every day for at least 10 minutes, and laugh more.<p>
 <li>Dietary—Nutrient imbalances or deficiencies can contribute to chronic depression, says Dr. Murray. “Correcting an underlying nutritional deficiency can restore normal mental function and relieve depression,” he adds. Among Dr. Murray’s recommendations: reduce your fat intake; eat at least 5 daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables; minimize your consumption of refined sugars and salt; eat much more fiber and complex carbohydrates (whole grains); and keep your protein intake moderate.<p>
 <li>Supplements—Start correcting the nutritional foundations of your health with a daily high-potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula, says Dr. Murray. In addition, he suggests taking daily folic acid (800 mcg), vitamin B12 (800 mcg), vitamin B6 (50-100 mg), and flaxseed oil.<p>
 <li>Herbs—As an additional antidepressant support, Dr. Murray recommends using Ginkgo biloba. For people over 50, take 80 mg, 3 times daily, with additional folic acid (1200 mcg) and vitamin B12 (1200 mcg). For people under 50, take St. John’s wort extract, 300 mg, 3 times daily.<p>
 <li>Amino Acids—Deficiencies or imbalances in the body’s levels of amino acids, which are essential protein building blocks, can also contribute to depression. Dr. Murray suggests 2000 mg of D- or L-phenylalanine, or 1000 mg of L-tyrosine, taken once daily, before breakfast.<p>
 <li>Insomnia—Depression often brings a disruption of normal sleeping rhythms. Helpful here are melatonin (3 mg) before bedtime; valerian herbal extract (150-300 mg) taken 30 minutes before bedtime; or GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid, an amino acid derivative), taken at 200-400 mg 30 minutes before bedtime. <p>
</ul><p>
“Adopting these guidelines is all that the majority of people with depression will need to do to elevate their mood,” says Dr. Murray.<p>

<a name="NutAidForMal"></a>
<b>NUTRITIONAL AID FOR MALE INFERTILITY</b><p>
Of the estimated 15% of U.S. couples who have problems conceiving, in about one-third of the cases, it is due to male infertility. In fact, approximately 6% of men aged 15-50 are believed to be infertile and, in 90% of cases, this is due to lowered sperm production, says naturopathic physician and educator Michael Pizzorno, N.D. In many cases, men are supplying “only about 40% of the number of sperm per ejaculation compared to 1940 levels,” he reports in Total Wellness.<p>
<ul>
 <li>Causes—Jeans and underwear that are tight-fitting heat the scrotum and testes, thereby inhibiting sperm production. Environmental pollution from cigarette smoke, heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic), pesticides, solvents, toxic chemicals, aflatoxin (a fungus found on peanuts and grains), and synthetic estrogens in poultry and dairy feed all interfere with sperm formation and protection. In a study of 100 males, aflatoxin levels in infertile men were 60% higher than in fertile men. <p>
</ul><p>

Dietary practices are also at fault, says Dr. Pizzorno. These include overconsumption of saturated fats, reduced intake of whole grains, fiber, and fresh vegetables and fruits, compounded with nutrient deficiencies. Chronic urinary or genital infections such as Chlamydia trachomati (a sexually transmitted disease) can impede fertility; research suggests that from 28% to 71% of infertile men have Chlamydia.<p>
<ul>
 <li>Cool the Scrotum—The ideal temperature for the male scrotum and testes is between 94 and 96°. Higher temperatures can severely inhibit or even stop sperm production. Dr. Pizzorno recommends wearing loose-fitting clothing, avoiding hot tubs, and taking occasional cold showers, especially after exercise.<p>
 <li>Garlic—Clinical evidence shows that garlic can neutralize numerous toxins, including aflatoxin, which otherwise start damaging DNA, says Dr. Pizzorno. “The message is clear: If you want healthy sperm, then avoid toxins and eat garlic.” Dr. Pizzorno also recommends eating organically raised fruits and vegetables to minimize toxin intake.<p>
 <li>Vitamin C—Levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) are higher in sperm than in other bodily fluids, including the blood. Vitamin C deficiencies have been linked with reduced seminal fluid ascorbic acid content and increased DNA damage. A group of 30 infertile men taking 1000 mg of vitamin C experienced a 140% increase in sperm count after one week; those taking 200 mg daily registered a 112% increase. After 60 days, all 30 men had successfully impregnated their wives. Dr. Pizzorno recommends 1000 mg of vitamin C daily, divided into 3 doses.<p>
 <li>Zinc—This mineral is crucial to all aspects of male reproductive function including sperm formation and movement. In a study involving 22 men who had been infertile for 5 or more years, after taking zinc sulfate (60 mg of elemental zinc) daily for 45 days, their sperm count increased by 250%; testosterone levels also increased. Dr. Pizzorno suggests taking 25 mg of zinc picolinate daily.<p>
 <li>Vitamin B12—Deficiencies in this vitamin are linked with lowered sperm counts and reduced sperm vitality. When men with sperm counts of less than 20 million per ml (the healthy norm for 1940 was 113 million per ml) took vitamin B12 at a daily dosage of 1000 mcg, 27% experienced an increase in sperm production to over 100 million per ml. Dr. Pizzorno recommends 1000 mcg daily of vitamin B12.<p>
 <li>Antioxidants—Environmental toxins generate harmful free radicals which in turn damage sperm and lead to lowered sperm counts. According to 2 studies, high levels of free radicals have been noted in the semen of 40% of infertile men. Antioxidants are nutritional substances that counter the negative effects of free radicals. Among those suitable for male infertility, Dr. Pizzorno recommends daily maintenance doses of beta carotene (25 mg, as mixed carotenoids), selenium (125 mcg), and vitamin E (400 IU of mixed tocopherols) as being helpful in protecting sperm. <p>
