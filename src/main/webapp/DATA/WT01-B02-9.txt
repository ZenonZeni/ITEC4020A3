A Week in the Life of HSLDA<BR>
The four-day work log for Scott Somerville and his two legal assistants, Cathy Gilstrap and Steve McGarvey, was originally 30 pages long. Obviously it was impossible to include every activity in this report. We have, therefore, selected highlights of their week's activities, and we hope this &quot;brief&quot; account will give you a glimpse of HSLDA in action during our busiest time of year.<BR>

<P><B>Monday, September 4</B><BR>
Labor day—federal holiday. HSLDA is closed.<BR>

<P><B>Tuesday, September 5</B><BR>
8:30 a.m. Scott, Cathy, and Steve join other members of the HSLDA staff in the legal library for a time of prayer. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, HSLDA sets aside a half hour to pray for members, organizational needs, and pressing state and federal issues.<BR>
8:52 a.m. Prayer meeting is over and the HSLDA staff prepare to meet their work week. Voice mail messages have accumulated over the long weekend. Both Steve and Cathy retrieve their messages. Steve begins returning phone calls. Cathy prints out the dictated correspondence she typed over the weekend for Scott's signature. <BR>
9:10 a.m. Scott breaks away from discussion with fellow attorneys. Arriving in his office, he switches on his computer, checks e-mail messages, and plays back his voice-mail messages. Calls Pat, a single mother in Florida who is trying to home school despite problems from welfare, social workers, and an ex-husband who is in prison.<BR>
9:13 a.m. Steve's phone rings. It is a member who permanently resides in Oklahoma, but is temporarily living in Kansas dealing with family matters after her father's death. Does she have to comply with Kansas law? She is also concerned about the possibility of family members turning her in to social services. Steve transfers the call to Scott.<BR>
9:15 a.m. Scott picks up the transferred call. Oklahoma law is much better than Kansas, so it will be better if she can stick with Oklahoma law. Scott suggests she not contact any Kansas officials until she gets within 186 days of the end of the school year. If she is still in Kansas then, she should register her school with the Kansas Department of Education.<BR>
	Scott spends the rest of his morning answering questions from members:<BR>
	A Rhode Island member calls. She has been told she &quot;must register&quot; her five-year-old with the school district, even though the child doesn't reach compulsory attendance age until next year. Scott tells her this is nonsense. &quot;Tell your school official you have spoken to your attorney, and that you are not required to register this child at this time,&quot; he says, &quot;if they give you any trouble, tell them to talk to your attorney, Scott Somerville, at our phone number. That usually does it.&quot;<BR>
&quot;This is outrageous!&quot; A member from Virginia calls and explains that she is in a battle over custody for her two sons from a previous marriage. On the day she was in the hospital delivering twins, her ex-husband went to court, claiming that home schooling is illegal. The mother's divorce attorney didn't know what to do and the judge took the two boys and put them in temporary custody of the father. (Later, Scott makes several calls and writes several letters—including a letter to the Virginia Attorney General—to try to help this family.)<BR>
9:30 a.m. Correspondence completed, Cathy begins returning phone calls. She starts with several left over from last Friday afternoon. During the time she is on the phone, ten new messages are left in her voice mail.<BR>
9:54 a.m. Steve answers his phone. A member from Illinois needs the Illinois sample letter. Her school district is demanding that the family fill out a notification form and submit grades for their children every semester. Neither of these regulatory measures are required by Illinois law. Steve sent her the sample letter to send the district instead of the form. He told her that if the school district continued to insist on the notification form, to call us and Scott will respond on her behalf.<BR>
12:00 p.m. A lull in the constant stream of telephone calls allows Scott to execute a quick exit from his office. Crossing to the opposite office suite, he enters the legal library. Four people wait for him — it's time for Logic at Lunch. (Scott teaches logic twice a week to any interested HSLDA staff and interns. A local 13-year-old home school student also attends.)<BR>
In the meantime, Cathy watches (and applauds) as Chuck Hurst, HSLDA's Office Manager, removes the &quot;old, yucky copier.&quot; Mechanical unreliability and—in spite of frequent visits from the repair man—consistently bad copies, have caused Cathy, Steve, and Scott to spend a lot of time at the copier upstairs. A replacement should arrive this afternoon.<BR>
 1:00 p.m. Logic is over. Scott returns to his office and calls a family in Virginia who is having a custody battle—the biological father is trying to take the children away from the home schooling mom.<BR>
1:30 p.m. Cathy is back from lunch and, in between the steady stream of incoming calls, works on returning call messages left on voice mail. Telephone calls fill her afternoon. <BR>
A member in Virginia calls. The mother just got married, and the father of her child is suing for custody (they never were married). The new husband wants some counsel. A hearing is set for the 11th, and the family plans to represent itself. Cathy passes the message on to Scott. <BR>
Several people call, concerned that their school systems haven't responded to their home school notices. Cathy tells them that as long as the school hasn't written back to say they can't home school, they shouldn't worry about it; the schools are very busy getting started with the public school students. The families will hear back soon enough, but they don't have to wait to hear back before starting their home school programs.<BR>
2:49 p.m. Steve answers his telephone. A lady from Texas wants to know if she has to fill out the forms her school district sent her and if, by filling out the forms, she is giving up her rights to keep the truant officer out of her home. Steve advises her that she is not required by state law to fill out the school district's home school notification form, nor is she required to allow a truant officer into her home. &quot;If a truant officer comes, call us immediately.&quot;<BR>
3:19 p.m. Steve begins transcribing an Illinois Court Report article that Scott dictated.<BR>
3:21 p.m. Scott calls an attorney in West Virginia who represents a child with special needs and is appealing a special education case to the 4th circuit. The family took the child out of a public school and home schooled him. The attorney is trying to figure out how this will affect the federal case.<BR>
3:58 p.m. David Gilstrap delivers the day's mail. Normally, HSLDA's daily mail is sorted and delivered by 11:30 a.m. However, the combination of yesterday's federal holiday and the beginning of the school year resulted in a mountain of mail.<BR>
4:00 p.m. Cathy decides to give the new copier a test drive. Unfortunately, it jams (the &quot;duplex&quot; isn't working), so she makes the familiar trek upstairs. She manages to get the copying done and all the envelopes stuffed so the letters can all go out in the afternoon mail.<BR>
4:01 p.m. Scott sees the pile of mail David has delivered. The busyness of the day is beginning to show. Scott can't even keep up with the    e-mail, much less the surface mail. <BR>
4:08 p.m. Scott works through the mail. He finds a wonderful letter of thanks from a family in Virginia and a card from a family in Texas. &quot;This almost makes going through the mail worthwhile,&quot; he muses.<BR>
4:12 p.m. Scott opens the next piece of mail and finds a letter praising the Lord because, after a full year of legal maneuverings, one Iowa family's special program for their 15-year-old with Down's Syndrome has been approved by the required authorities. Scott takes a minute to call and congratulate the family for this good news. <BR>
4:18 p.m. Scott is still going through his mail. He reads a letter from a school district in Rhode Island which has a blatantly unconstitutional policy. They say, &quot;We have not revised our policy. We will not approve any home school requests if our policy is not followed. We are referring this matter to our attorney.&quot;<BR>
4:25 p.m. Scott completes a letter to the Rhode Island school district attorney regarding their unconstitutional policy.<BR>
4:29 p.m. Scott opens a letter from a Texas family. Their school district issued them a ridiculous 5-page form to complete and return. Scott fills out the form, marking 9/10ths of it &quot;not applicable.&quot;<BR>
4:43 p.m. Scott is still going through the morning's mail. He sighs as he reads a letter from Frederick County, Virginia, public schools. HSLDA has had six different battles going on with this one county. Scott directs Cathy to instruct our member family on how to respond.<BR>
5:03 p.m. Scott is down to the last piece of mail. That's it for Tuesday, September 5!<BR>

<P><B>Wednesday, September 6</B><BR>
7:45 a.m. Cathy arrives early in an attempt to get a head start on the day. She begins by gathering up some studies and other materials to send to a member in Rhode Island who's going to be making a presentation at the end of the month to her school committee.<BR>
8:27 a.m. Steve arrives at work.<BR>
8:30 a.m. Cathy walks next door to the Membership Department to pick up labels she printed for all the members in Duval County, Florida. She is preparing to send them a copy of the letter Scott wrote to their superintendent. Erin Smith, one of HSLDA's receptionists, hands her a note with the phone number of a new Massachusetts member who has a meeting with her superintendent this morning. Cathy returns to her desk immediately and calls the woman back. She advises her on what the officials do and do not have a right to ask her about. The member seems a lot less nervous by the time Cathy finishes the call.<BR>
	9:00 a.m. Cathy calls the copier repair company and they promise to come and fix the machine. Now it's on to mail.<BR>
9:00 a.m. Scott is processing mail. A letter notifies him of a religious exemption hearing half way across Virginia. Why is this such a big state? But there is good news, too: a news report indicates that an Illinois school district is creating a positive home school policy.<BR>
9:30 a.m. Scott calls an attorney in Massachusetts to resolve outstanding details on a black single mother who was prosecuted for taking her children out of the public school. (Conflict with school officials began when the mother refused to send her daughter, who was becoming suicidal, back to public school.) This mother faced three different legal charges, plus a child neglect charge when she asked Massachusetts home schoolers for help. With HSLDA's help, she decided to start home schooling.<BR>
9:50 a.m. Cathy listens to her voice mail. One message is from a West Virginia member who says she has a school official at her door! Scott is on another call, so Cathy calls her right back. The situation has already been dealt with and the mother is relieved. David Gordon, HSLDA's litigation attorney, was able to take her call and the officials had already left. The mother indicates that they have neighbors who are nosey about their children occasionally being outside during school hours. She thinks the officials might come back. Cathy tells her that any time there is an official at the door or it is an emergency situation to tell the receptionist so she won't get transferred into voice mail.<BR>
9:53 a.m. Scott assigns Thad Cardine the task of researching and writing an article for the Court Report on the current status of Florida home schoolers participating in public school sports. <BR>
9:54 a.m. Scott calls the Massachusetts attorney about the black single mother situation.<BR>
10:10 a.m. Steve prepares for his trip to the Oregon Home School Conference in Portland. He will be working the HSLDA table. He runs various errands, picking up petty cash, confirming materials sent, verifying Mike Farris' schedule, etc. . . .<BR>
10:20 a.m. Cathy calls one of our members in Prince William County who will be required to appear at a religious exemption hearing at the end of the month. She just wants to touch base with the family and make sure they are prepared. They should be getting a letter from the school district soon.<BR>
10:55 a.m. Scott has a very unpleasant conversation with a school board attorney regarding a mother whose two sons were taken away by a family court judge. After completing the call, Scott sets up meeting with David Gordon, HSLDA's litigation attorney, to discuss the matter.<BR>
11:11 a.m. Steve takes a call from a lady in New Hampshire who asks if she can home school someone else's child for a short amount of time. He tells her it is fine as long as she notifies the person to whom she sent her notice of intent. In New Hampshire, notification can be made to either the school district superintendent, the private school principal, or the commissioner of education.<BR>
11:26 a.m. Scott meets with David Gordon to have an extended discussion regarding the case in which the mother's two sons were taken away by a family court judge.<BR>
12:26 p.m. Scott spends quite a while counseling a Massachusetts mother who is deeply concerned because she was told by her principal that her children had to be on the school bus tomorrow. Scott says, &quot;This happens thirty or forty times every year. You do what is best for your child, and I'll deal with the school district.&quot;<BR>
12:36 p.m. Scott calls a home schooling mother in Massachusetts whose school district has an absolutely insane policy. The district's policy dates back almost 14 years—long before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that home schooling is constitutionally protected. Scott assigns himself the task of writing a &quot;squawk&quot; letter to let the district know that their policy exceeds the law. (Scott and Cathy have a whole drawer full of &quot;squawk&quot; letters.)<BR>
1:04 p.m. Scott is back from lunch and checking the messages that have accrued while he was away from his desk.<BR>
1:08 p.m. Scott finds good news! Iowa now permits substitute teachers to supervise home school programs. Requirements for home school supervisors has been a gray area in Iowa law since the statute was passed in 1991, but it looks like the department of education is on our side on this one. This is great for Iowa families who want to work with a teacher they know and trust, rather than an unknown, full-time state employee.<BR>
1:10 p.m. Scott gets a call from Prince William County saying the hearings are confirmed for Wednesday, September 27th. <BR>
1:15 p.m. Steve receives a fax from a Texas member in the Early Independent School District (ISD). The fax explains that the principal of the local primary school is trying to require home schoolers to submit their curriculum for approval.<BR>
1:16 p.m. Cathy receives an e-mail from Scott asking her to arrange for a court reporter for the hearing.<BR>
1:32 p.m. Scott calls a principal in Rhode Island about a family who is trying to get started legally there.<BR>
1:34 p.m. Scott is dealing with the Granite School District in Utah that has been very difficult to deal with. The Granite district is in the Salt Lake City area, and they use form letters to try to process hundreds of home schoolers each year. Home schoolers don't like to be &quot;processed.&quot;<BR>
2:00 p.m. Cathy answers a call from a Utah member who says they have moved to a new school district. Last year HSLDA wrote to their old school district. The father tells her, &quot;This new one is even worse.&quot; He faxes us the district's forms and other materials and asks for our opinion. <BR>
Cathy calls him back and tells him that they don't need to use the school's forms; they can just write a letter. She assures him that Scott will write a letter to the district and that we'll fax him a copy of the letter and a sample letter for his use in responding to the district. <BR>
2:10 p.m. Scott types a letter to the Utah school district protesting its illegal policy. Home schoolers in Utah are not required to use the school district's &quot;permission&quot; forms. Scott spells out what districts can and cannot do in Utah.<BR>
A Rhode Island mother calls about the difficult situation in her district. Rhode Island, like Utah, insists on &quot;approving&quot; home school programs. This Rhode Island district demands a whole laundry list of promises and evidence before they will &quot;approve&quot; a family.<BR>
2:45 p.m. Scott concludes a long conversation with the political operator for the Accelerated Christian Education schools who alerted us to the Maxwell v. TEA case in Texas. In this public school case, the Texas Attorney General filed a brief which argues that &quot;parents do not have fundamental rights.&quot; Texas home schoolers go ballistic over this!<BR>
2:51 p.m. Scott contacts a truant officer in Frederick County, Virginia about a family claiming religious exemption. Next he calls another official about the same issue.<BR>
3:18 p.m. Scott prints out the letter to Utah's Granite School District.<BR>
3:20 p.m. Scott formulates a letter to the Early ISD (Texas) advising the school officials that there is no provision in Texas law which allows them to review home schoolers' curriculum. <BR>
3:23 p.m. Scott answers questions from a member about home schooling children who are not immediate family members (i.e. nephews, grandchildren, etc.) in Massachusetts.<BR>
3:30 p.m. Cathy receives a call from a member in Frederick County, Virginia, who says that a school official (truant officer from the high school) called her husband at work to find out where their children are. They are applying for religious exemption, but the husband just told the person that they're planning to home school. Cathy tells her we will call the school official back to tell them the family is applying for religious exemption and to see if there are any problems. <BR>
3:35 p.m. Scott gives Steve the Early ISD letter. It is to be sent to the school principal and the superintendent. Steve is also to send copies to each HSLDA member in the Early district.<BR>
3:45 a.m. The mother in Frederick County, Virginia, calls back. The truant officer called her husband again and this time he told the officer to call HSLDA. <BR>
3:51 p.m. Scott takes a call from a Frederick County school official regarding religious exemptions. School officials there have been systematically harassing home schoolers all fall. More and more members want to opt out of this nasty situation through the religious exemption law. This would end any on-going contact with the school.<BR>
        3:52 p.m. Steve runs a query on HSLDA's membership database to determine the number of members in the Early ISD. He prints address labels and prepares the mailing.<BR>
        4:20 p.m. Steve talks to a woman in Pennsylvania who is moving to New Hampshire. She asks what New Hampshire law is like and if she needs to notify the Pennsylvania school district that they are moving. Steve answers her questions and says he will send her a copy of the New Hampshire home schooling statute summary. He transfers her to Dana Sweeney, the legal assistant for Pennsylvania, for an answer to her question about notifying her school district of her impending move.<BR>
5:02 p.m. Scott talks to a Rhode Island principal about a family. He explains that Rhode Island law is very limited as applied to families with sincere religious objections to public school approval. The principal agrees to back off on several of his demands.<BR>
5:10 p.m. Cathy works until 6:00 p.m. making phone calls. She just can't seem to break away! One of the families needs a special-ed attorney referral for Massachusetts. She sends Scott an e-mail note about this.<BR>

<P><B>Thursday, September 7</B><BR>
7:00 a.m. Steve takes an early flight out of Dulles on his way to Portland, Oregon, where he will work the HSLDA table at the home school conference.<BR>
8:10 a.m. Cathy arrives at work. She begins the day by mailing information on the Virginia law to a Michigan member who is considering moving.<BR>
8:30 a.m. Cathy goes to HSLDA staff prayer meeting in the legal library.<BR>
8:30 a.m. Scott arrives for morning prayer. Today we pray for the work load—it's always very intense at the beginning of the school year, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, and a number of other issues.<BR>
9:00 a.m. Cathy listens to her voice mail messages. <BR>
9:15 a.m. Scott flips on his computer. By some miracle he hasn't received any voice mail messages yet, but two e-mail messages are already waiting for him.<BR>
9:15 a.m. Cathy returns a call from a family in Worcester, Massachusetts. The school psychologist had called the family to set up an appointment to come by their house with their &quot;school adjustment counselor&quot; with a form for the mother to sign. The psychologist and adjustment counselor had wanted to come by that day, but the mother explained that she is busy, and they agree to an appointment next week. Cathy tells the mother that she should offer to go to their office to sign the form rather than have them come to her home. If she has any questions about the form, she can explain that &quot;her lawyer needs to review it first.&quot;<BR>
9:23 a.m. Scott begins a letter to a member family in Rhode Island.<BR>
9:35 a.m. Cathy returns the call of a member in Florida who is enrolled in an umbrella school requiring physical examinations of their children. The law says that any child enrolled in a public or private school is required to have a physical examination, but that &quot;any child shall be exempt from the requirement of a health examination upon written request of the parent or guardian of such child stating objections to such examination on religious grounds.&quot; Cathy tells her to just write a letter and give it to the school for their files.<BR>
9:58 a.m. Scott answers a telephone call from a member family in Tennessee who is still trying to get the first ever exemption to the home school bachelor's degree requirement granted.<BR>
10:19 a.m. Scott takes a call from an Illinois member. Her abusive husband is divorcing her and, after five years of successful home schooling, is trying to attack the home school and take custody of the children. Scott outlines the basic defense for home school custody cases and promises to help bring her divorce lawyer up to speed on home schooling.<BR>
10:39 a.m. Scott calls Pat Farrenga of Holt Associates in Boston to ask for help finding expert witnesses for an un-schooling family who is being rejected by their school district.<BR>
10:47 a.m. Scott calls the un-schooling family in Massachusetts to check on their status. Massachusetts school districts have real trouble &quot;approving&quot; families who have no formal schedule or structure for their program. This family was approved last year by a very understanding assistant superintendent—but he has since moved to Vermont.<BR>
11:00 a.m. Cathy is listening to more voice mail messages when Cynthia Clapp, a membership coordinator, stops by. Cynthia wants to talk to Scott about the Virginia law's five-year-old exemption and about permissible work hours for 17-year-olds, but Mike Farris is in Scott's office. <BR>
11:21 a.m. Scott talks to Doug Phillips about an attorney who is an expert on child abuse cases. Doug needs to know whether he is a good resource.<BR>
11:29 a.m. Scott takes a call from an Indiana family member. The local school district has forced the family into a due process hearing. We're going to have to sue this district.<BR>
11:45 a.m. Cathy is paged to pick up a call. It is a member family in Virginia who was visited by social services. They were reported for physical abuse of their children. The mother is calling from a pay phone. Cathy transfers the call to Scott.<BR>
11:46 a.m. Scott answers the phone, and advises the mother on how to handle a social worker contact. (Editor's note: several weeks later, HSLDA files a federal civil rights lawsuit against the social worker in this case.)<BR>
11:55 a.m. Cathy answers a call from Cynthia who had just taken a call from a non-member. The non-member pulled her child out of school last spring, but didn't do anything else to comply with the Virginia home school law. Whenever the school called, she would just tell them that she was home schooling under a religious exemption. When the school told her that she had to apply for the exemption, she refused to do so. <BR>
Now that another school year has begun, the school district is calling and insisting that she apply for a religious exemption by tomorrow, or her child will have to go back to school. The mother says she just found out yesterday that she was supposed to write a letter requesting a religious exemption. Cynthia told the mother that she should tell the school district that she'll mail them a letter. Cathy told Cynthia that was fine. The mother is express-mailing her membership application. <BR>
12:05 p.m. Cathy hears a desperate page over the intercom. A member in Ohio was reported to social services by a neighbor and needed to speak to someone. Scott is on the telephone. Cathy picks up the call, and, realizing it's the lunch hour, scrambles to find an attorney. Christopher Klicka takes the call.<BR>
12:10 p.m. Scott hangs up the phone. He has been talking to a Virginia home schooling mother who has been visited by social workers claiming educational neglect and physical abuse. The social worker, frustrated by the family's refusal to waive their constitutional rights, goes off to find some other way to get to the children.<BR>
1:29 p.m. Scott gets off the phone with a welfare worker who says our home schooling mother has to make $7.50 more per week or else her food stamps will be cut.<BR>
1:43 p.m. Scott receives a letter from a Massachusetts school district attorney dismissing child neglect charges against our black single mother.<BR>
3:18 p.m. Scott speaks to the Massachusetts un-schooling mother about the program approval process.<BR>
3:20 p.m. Cathy receives an   e-mail from Scott which contains the name of a special education attorney in Massachusetts. She calls the member who requested the information.<BR>
4:32 p.m. Scott talks to the Assistant Superintendent of Massachusetts regarding the un-schooling situation. The child has special needs.<BR>
4:45 p.m. Scott talks with the Virginia home schooling mother who is on welfare. She has managed to get extra hours from her employer. She called her case worker who said, &quot;That should do it. Get it in writing, and we won't cut your food stamps.&quot;<BR>
4:51 p.m. Scott calls the family in Indiana. He also calls CPS and the police officers. He leaves messages. The police station is radioing the police officer so he can get back to Scott about this child protective service issue.<BR>
5:13 p.m. Scott speaks to a local support group leader in Kansas. Their district is coming up with a new truancy policy. Scott outlines what that policy should include.<BR>
5:00 – 6:00 p.m. Cathy stays late to catch up on her telephone calls.<BR>

<P><B>Friday, September 8th</B><BR>
8:15 a.m. Cathy logs into her computer.<BR>
8:20 a.m. Cathy finds a voice mail message forwarded to her by the HSLDA receptionist from a Canadian member who is interested in the laws of South Dakota. Cathy records the message with a note to call later this morning (if she calls now it will only be 6:20 a.m. Alberta time). <BR>
8:22 a.m. Scott walks in the door. Stops to look at the Washington Post story on Senator Packwood's resignation. He notices Steve McGarvey's dark office and remembers that he is at the Oregon conference. This isn't a pretty time for him to be elsewhere—we had 32 calls yesterday, and altogether too many of them were from social workers.<BR>
      8:25 a.m. Cathy prints out the religious exemption letters she typed last night and places them on Scott's desk for his signature. Of course, he's already on the telephone.<BR>
      8:40 a.m. Cathy makes a quick trip to the mailroom. As she walks by the receptionist desk she hears Son-Mi being paged for a call. Since Son-Mi isn't in yet, Cathy takes the call. It is a non-member from New Hampshire who is having problems with her school district. Cathy offers some suggestions and puts a membership application in the mail for her.<BR>
8:56 a.m. Scott processes e-mail and voice mail messages. <BR>
9:25 a.m. Scott discovers that the batteries in his microcassette have gone dead. All the entries he so diligently spoke into the microphone this morning weren't recorded. He calls Cathy on the intercom and asks her to find him some new batteries.<BR>
9:30 a.m. Cathy answers a call from Lisa, one of HSLDA's receptionists. The Rhode Island family with custody problems needs to talk to someone right away. The school board can't approve their program because the ex-wife has issued a restraining order, preventing the family from home schooling. Cathy transfers the call to Scott.<BR>
9:46 a.m. Scott installs new batteries in his microcassette recorder and recaps the entries he thought he'd already made that morning . . . <BR>
He spoke with a family who got a letter from CPS in Indiana yesterday outlining how to defend themselves if investigated by social workers. <BR>
9:53 a.m. Scott dictates a letter closing the Massachusetts case where the school district prosecuted a black single mother.<BR>
10:00 a.m. Cathy begins returning telephone calls. <BR>
She reads an e-mail note from Linda. A new member family in Florida says their doctor has informed them he will have to report the family because they don't have paperwork filed for their religious exemption to immunizations. (The family had written a letter for the umbrella school's file.) Cathy calls the mother and tells her that she will send her the required form—the family and the doctor will have to sign it and it will have to be placed on file at the umbrella school where the family is enrolled.<BR>
10:04 a.m. Scott dictates a letter to a Massachusetts superintendent who has suddenly changed the rules for home schoolers in his district.<BR>
10:34 a.m. Scott writes a letter to the Providence, Rhode Island, school district, explaining that their rigid policy must be changed to accommodate sincere religious objections.<BR>
10:55 a.m. Scott completes a telephone call with a Rhode Island father whose ex-wife has filed a restraining order preventing his school district from approving his home school program.<BR>
11:01 a.m. Scott dictates a fire-breathing letter to the superintendent of Middleboro, Massachusetts, who won't approve home schoolers unless they establish a predetermined time for their child to be involved with educational time activities, allow on-site visits by school officials, allow testing by school officials, provide documentation that the &quot;educational rights of the child have been properly and appropriately maintained,&quot; cooperate &quot;fully with the school department in all matters related to the education of the child,&quot; and &quot;provide to the satisfaction of the school department a wholesome and stimulating environment which promotes the intellectual, emotional, and physical development of the child.&quot; <BR>
11:13 a.m. Scott dictates a letter to an attorney for the really obnoxious school district in Williamsburg, Virginia. This district had refused to &quot;acknowledge&quot; the home school program for a single mother unless the father agreed. The father used this fact to gain custody of the children.<BR>
11:32 a.m. Scott speaks to the Massachusetts attorney about the black single mother case.<BR>
11:35 a.m. Scott suddenly lifts up his eyes and sees a mountain of incoming mail. &quot;Oh help!&quot;<BR>
12:02 p.m. Scott hangs up the phone. He has been talking to an Indiana Child Protection Service worker, and then with the family in this case. CPS received a report that the child may be a victim. But after Scott grilled the social worker, she said, &quot;Well, the parents are not the ones who are suspected to have done anything.&quot; <BR>
Scott called the parents and advised the family to meet with the CPS worker at her office to discuss what is alleged to have happened to their child. They were very glad to hear that they were not the suspects, but obviously disturbed to hear that their child had been reported to be a victim. The parents closed the conversation by thanking Scott over and over again for what he'd done in this case and saying, &quot;Our membership fee has been earned many, many times over just in the last couple of days here.&quot;<BR>
12:21 p.m. Scott receives a call from the education secretary in the Oklahoma governor's office. She is asking for our comments on an Oklahoma school district which is trying to unlawfully regulate home schoolers.<BR>
12:42 p.m. Scott hangs up the telephone. He has just finished speaking with the Oklahoma governor's educational policy advisor. This lady ran for state superintendent of education and lost by 1/3 of 1% of the vote. The governor then nominated her to be secretary of education, and the Democrats, on a straight party line and very public vote, rejected her. She is now the educational policy advisor for the governor, and she is just a fabulous person.<BR>
1:31 p.m. Scott completes a call with Oklahoma home school leaders. A year ago, the Oklahoma Department of Education &quot;floated&quot; a new policy, but it was soundly rejected by state officials. Unfortunately, the department never bothered to tell the school districts that the policy was not to be used, and it has resurfaced. Scott and the Oklahoma home school leaders discussed strategy for dealing with this situation.<BR>
2:07 p.m. Scott talks to the Massachusetts un-schooler who is trying very hard to get a home school program approved. The school officials just can't handle the un-schooling philosophy. (Editor's note: Several weeks later, after many telephone calls, this family was finally approved.)<BR>
2:33 p.m. Scott talks to a Massachusetts state leader on the phone. School districts all over the state are harassing home schoolers. Scott encourages the leaders to meet with local support groups to fight bad policies.<BR>
2:59 p.m. Scott goes over Florida sports story assignment with Thad Cardine, one of HSLDA's interns.<BR>
3:15 p.m. Scott skims through pleadings in a federal suit brought by a non-member.<BR>
3:23 p.m. Scott is still processing the day's mail.<BR>
3:42 p.m. Scott calls school officials in Massachusetts about nasty threatening letters to our member family.<BR>
4:40 p.m. Cathy calls a family in South Dakota who is wondering if it's okay to have their teenaged daughters occasionally babysit during school hours. There is no legal reason why this should be a problem, but Cathy suggests that if possible, it might be better for the children to come to the teenager's home for babysitting during school hours. If that is not an option, Cathy stresses making sure that the teen knows the proper procedures for handling people at the door or answering the phone.<BR>
4:40 p.m. Scott returns the call of a non-member mother in a desperate condition in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her children are probably going to be taken away from her unless she gets them into a private school immediately. <BR>
5:00 p.m. Scott completes the phone call with the desperate single mother in Milwaukee. She is a Black Muslim, so Scott assists her in locating a private Muslim school that may be able to help her.<BR>
5:08 p.m. Scott talks to another Massachusetts family who is being driven &quot;up their tree&quot; by obnoxious and ignorant superintendents.<BR>
5:30 p.m. Cathy listens to a message from a new member in Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The Uxbridge school district has implemented a new policy which allows home schoolers to receive vouchers for their programs, but now it's official that there are strings attached: the families must agree to home visits, they have to use the school district's tests, etc., and it looks like the home schoolers are going to be required to follow OBE guidelines. This is not good. Cathy calls her back and talks to her about it. She also copies the mother's message over to Scott because she thinks he'll be interested in hearing all this.<BR>
5:50 p.m. Cathy logs out of her computer and turns off the light. Another week at HSLDA is over.Across the States<BR>

<i>Still a State of Confusion for Home Schoolers</i><BR>

<P>In the golden state, an onslaught of misinformation and misinterpretation regarding home schooling again accompanies the beginning of school.  The following items are representative of the kind of misinformation communicated to home school families in California:<BR>
	1. San Diego City Schools informed home school families a $25 fee would have to accompany the private school affidavit in order for it to be accepted for the 1995-96 school year.  Additionally, it was suggested that the administrator of the private/home school provide attendance records, teacher qualifications, and course of study for review by public school officials.<BR>
	2. Los Angeles continues to assert, as it has in past years, that home school families are required to pay a $25 processing fee for filing the private school affidavit.<BR>
	3. Accompanying affidavits received by home schoolers in Fontana, California, was a letter indicating that the administrators of the private school should provide the school's attendance journal, the qualifications of the teachers teaching in the private school, and the courses of study which would be offered.<BR>
	4. San Francisco City Schools informed a home school mother that since she was not a certified teacher, she was not entitled to receive an affidavit.  After the family read information from the CHEA Introduction to Home Schooling Manual, they decided they would have the father go down to see if he could obtain the affidavit.  Along with CHEA, we have discovered that social workers, police officers, and school officials treat mothers differently than they do fathers.  Sure enough, when the father politely but forcefully demanded the affidavit, the school officials handed it over.<BR>
	5. It is almost universal now in every county that sends out a packet of information accompanying the private school affidavit, that there will be a letter outlining the State Department of Education's position that home schooling is only legal under the tutorial provision in California, found in Education Code ¤ 48224.<BR>
	It bears repeating that home education in California is accomplished under the private school provision of the Education Code.  California is not unique in this respect.  Eleven other states recognize home education under private school provisions.  However, not everyone in California—especially the state department of education—agrees that home schooling can be accomplished under the private school exemption.  It is important to understand that the state department of education does not have any legal jurisdiction to determine which children are exempt from public school attendance.  All they can do is furnish their opinions to local school districts which do have jurisdiction over attendance issues.<BR>
	The state department of education's position that home schoolers must be certified teachers is arguably an unconstitutional invasion of a parent's right to choose home education.  For religiously motivated parents, this interferes with religious rights under both the California and the United States Constitutions.  In order to legally interfere with a fundamental right (i.e., the right to home educate under the 14th and 1st Amendments of the U.S. Constitution), the state would have to demonstrate that it had a compelling interest in seeing every child is taught by a certified teacher and that certification is the least restrictive means available to achieve its objective of literacy and self-sufficiency.<BR>
	This could not be proven, since 49 other states do not require certification.  Therefore, the requirement for certification for home school teachers would be the most oppressive law in the United States, and the state of California should fail in its attempt to require certification for home school teachers.<BR>
	Requests by school districts to view courses of study, qualifications of teachers, and attendance registers are beyond the school district's authority as well.  The Education Code provides that the school district is entitled only to verify that the private school affidavit, which is to be filed between October 1st and 15th each year, has been filed.  The local school district, which is charged with enforcing attendance, does not have the authority to approve, evaluate, or license private schools or any program of a private school.<BR>
	The attempt to charge a fee for processing the affidavit by county departments of education also exceeds the county's authority under the Education Code.  Under Education Code ¤ 48222 and ¤ 33190, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, not the county office of education, is to receive the filing of the annual affidavit.  However, out of courtesy, the county offices of education have undertaken the role of providing and receiving the private school affidavits.  But merely undertaking another's function does not give authority to &quot;legislate&quot; new requirements.<BR>
	We continue to urge member families not to pay the filing fee, which would set bad precedent for further inroads into the freedoms of private schools in California.<BR>

<i>Sports Bill Update</i><BR>

<P>	First they can't, then they can, then they can't again, and now . . . well, no one knows for sure. Florida home schoolers have been on quite a roller coaster ride lately, regarding whether or not they can participate in inter-scholastic, extra-   curricular student activities. The guidelines of the Florida High School Activities Association (FHSAA) require all students to attend an &quot;accredited public or private school.&quot; Home schoolers have not been permitted to participate in inter-scholastic activities in the past, because the FHSAA does not recognize the legality of home education in the state of Florida. Earlier this year, a bill allowing participation of home schoolers was passed almost unanimously, only to be vetoed by Governor Lawton Chiles. In hopes of returning authority to communities, the Governor called the legislation unnecessary, saying every district was free to permit home schoolers to participate on sports teams. His judgment has been proven false. <BR>
	In an attempt to demonstrate cooperation, the FHSAA has stated that they will allow home schoolers to participate in public school activities as long as they follow certain guidelines. The FHSAA stipulates that home schoolers must ask their local school board for permission to participate in school activities. The school district must then draft a provision allowing individual students to participate.  <BR>
	But even if home schoolers get permission to play from their own school district, the sports event could be considered forfeit, because of previous FHSAA regulations. The regulations require all students to attend an &quot;accredited public or private school.&quot; Therefore, the FHSAA could declare a forfeit in any competition in which home schoolers are involved. <BR>
	According to Florida home school lobbyist Brenda Dickinson, this situation is unsatisfactory. Home schoolers want to be able to participate not only in athletic competitions, but all inter-scholastic activities—within public or private schools, and as separate home school groups as well. Many home school groups in Florida are larger than a lot of private schools. <BR>
	Florida home school leaders are scheduled to meet with Governor Chiles and the director of the FHSAA within the next few weeks for possible negotiations. Florida residents are encouraged to write their senators and representatives polite, grammatically correct letters requesting access to all inter-scholastic, extra-curricular activities for public schools, private schools, and separate home school groups.<BR>

<i>School Districts Send Intrusive Forms</i><BR>

<P>	Some school districts in the state of Kentucky are requesting that home schoolers fill out a census form which contains essentially the same information required of public school students.  Some information contained in the census is authorized for private school reporting. <BR>
The only information that a private school (home schoolers operate as private schools in Kentucky) are obligated to provide is the following:<BR>
	1. The name of the school; <BR>
	2. The address of the school; and<BR>
	3. The names and ages of the children attending the school.<BR>
	Kentucky Revised Statute ¤ 159.160 does provide that, in addition to the names, ages and places of residents of all pupils in attendance at the school, the superintendent may request any other facts the public school superintendent might require to help carry out the laws relating to compulsory attendance and employment of children.  However, it is our position that the names, ages and places of residences of the pupils is sufficient to assist the attendance officer in carrying out his/her responsibilities.  <BR>
	To require social security numbers, race of child, and other intrusive information about private school students interferes with parental rights under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and, for religiously motivated parents, interferes with the Free Exercise of Religion freedoms under the 1st Amendment.  For the school district to require this information, they would have to demonstrate a compelling interest in receiving the requested information (i.e., it is of the highest importance and that is the least intrusive alternative available).  In this case, the least intrusive means is what is already being provided by home schoolers submitting notification information.<BR>
	We believe the subject school districts will back off; however, at this time we do not have affirmation from the school districts to that effect.  Any HSLDA family receiving requests for information exceeding what is indicated above should contact our office for direction.<BR>

<i>No Accuracy in Advertising in Knox County</i><BR>

<P>	The Knox County Office of Education has taken an interesting approach in their attempt to make home schoolers provide notification of enrollment.  The Office of Education took out a classified ad in the local newspaper, entitled, &quot;Notice—Knox County Parents Who Are Home Schooling.&quot;<BR>
	The advertisement stated that home schoolers had to notify the Recorder of Deeds or the chief school officer of the public school within 30 days of establishing a home school program, and by September 1st annually thereafter in order to comply with the Missouri law.<BR>
	The ad further indicated that parents had to provide the name and age of each child attending the school, the address and telephone number of the home school, the name and address of each person teaching, and the names, addresses, and signature of each person making the declaration of enrollment.<BR>
	The notification was accurate in almost every respect with the exception of one major provision: that, in order to be in compliance with the Missouri law, a home schooler has to give notification.  The home school law provides that: &quot;For the purposes of minimizing unnecessary investigations due to reports of truancy, the home schooling parent or other person responsible for causing the child to participate in a home school program may provide notification to the recorder of deeds or the chief school officer.&quot;<BR>
	Home School Legal Defense Association continues to take the position that home schoolers do not need to provide notice in Missouri.  Unless you are uncomfortable not giving notice, you should not do so.  If you do provide notice, then you are obligated to provide notice annually thereafter according to the statute.<BR>
	One home schooler was on the ball in Knox County.  She immediately ran a &quot;rebuttal&quot; ad to clarify the matter and correct the inaccuracy.  This is a situation where the home schooler had to educate the educators!<BR>

<i>Families in Wappingers Falls Continue to Face Difficulties</i><BR>

<P>	Thirteen Home School Legal Defense Association families residing within the Wappingers Central School District in Wappingers Falls have been notified by the local superintendent that their individualized home instruction plans (IHIPs) are deficient because they are not &quot;measurable.&quot; According to Mr. John G. Marmillo, Superintendent of Schools, measurability can be achieved by either submitting a scope and sequence for all subject areas or copies of the table of contents for all textbooks to be utilized. The authority cited by Mr. Marmillo in requiring this information as part of the families' IHIPs is the handbook developed by the Dutchess County Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) which is, in effect, performing the administrative function of the school district without any express authority to do so. <BR>
	Home instruction in New York is regulated exclusively by the provisions of Section 100.10 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education. In developing an IHIP, parents must submit either a list of the syllabi, curriculum materials, textbooks, or plan of instruction to be used in each of the required subjects. There is no requirement that parents submit a table of contents or scope and sequence chart in order to comply with this regulatory provision. The state education department has provided guidelines for parents and public school officials in situations where a local school district may not be familiar with the textbooks being utilized by the parent. In this situation, it is considered reasonable for the district to require more than the name, publisher, copyright date and author's name—the district may request additional information in the form of a table of contents or written scope and sequence describing the text. <BR>
	Wappingers Falls officials, however, do not claim to be unfamiliar with the textbooks or other curriculum materials described in the IHIPs. Rather, the officials contend that the measurability of a home instruction curriculum must be demonstrated through the submission of the table of contents or scope and sequence charts as a part of the initial IHIP submission to the school district.<BR>
	HSLDA attorney Dewitt Black has responded on behalf of all the member families involved in this controversy, which first arose during the 1994-95 school year. Unless the school officials accept HSLDA's position, it is likely that the superintendent's decision will have to be appealed to the local Board of Education. Last year the local public school officials failed to notify the families of their objections to the IHIPs within the time frame established by the home instruction regulation, a procedural defect which the school district has avoided this year.<BR>

<i>Home School Representatives Meet with DPI Officials</i><BR>

<P>	On August 10, 1995, Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Dewitt Black, Reverend Clinton Birst, Executive Director of the North Dakota Home School Association, and North Dakota attorney Greg Lange met with six officials from the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (DPI) and a representative from the North Dakota Attorney General's office in Bismarck to review proposals for new administrative rules. The new rules are necessary because of changes in the home school law during the most recent legislative session. <BR>
	DPI officials expressed a desire to include representatives from the home school movement in the development of the new administrative rules in an effort to avoid future litigation and other difficulties. In the past, HSLDA has challenged the actions of DPI and local school districts in North Dakota based upon a different understanding of the legislative intent of the home instruction statutes and our position that the DPI exceeded its authority in administrative rules which were supposed to be issued only on the basis of enacted legislation.<BR>
	After the meeting, it was agreed that five questions would be submitted to the Attorney General of North Dakota for an opinion before the administrative rules are drafted. The issues raised relate to the revised monitoring requirements and standardized testing provisions. After the Attorney General's opinion is received by DPI, another meeting is planned sometime in November to discuss any remaining differences.<BR>

<i>Contacts Kick Off the School Year</i><BR>

<P>	The 1995-96 school year began with an unusual amount of calls from families who were contacted with requests that exceed the home school laws.  One would expect that after six years under the current regulations these matters would become routine.  However, the phone logs at HSLDA prove the contrary.<BR>
	A member family in Covington Exempted Village submitted their notification accompanied by the required outline and list of text books.  In response they received a letter stating that the school district's form must be completed.  We continue to see these kinds of demands in numerous counties.  However, this superintendent went a step further, indicating he wanted &quot;to see, in advance, all the materials, specifically, textbooks and workbooks you would use in your home instruction project.&quot;  This demand far exceeds any authority given to superintendents by home school regulations.<BR>
	Countless county and city superintendents continue to use the &quot;approval&quot; language home schoolers find so objectionable.  They continue to send home schoolers &quot;applications&quot; and &quot;requests for home schooling&quot; even after the family has submitted a notification in compliance with the regulations.  Home schooling is a right protected by the Constitution, not a privilege.  Letters to families that have been &quot;approved&quot; for home schooling violate this principle.  In response, HSLDA has mailed letters to superintendents addressing these concerns. <BR>
	Dayton City Schools continued requiring home schoolers to have their &quot;request&quot; form notarized—another demand which exceeds regulations.  The Dayton City Schools sent an additional form to home schoolers requesting the student's social security number, ethnic background, last school attended, and an explanation of why the family chose home schooling.<BR>
	Confusion regarding mandatory kindergarten and the compulsory school age continues to reign.  Once again, kindergarten is mandatory if you are going to attend public school first grade.  Home schoolers are not required to report five-year-olds to school officials, nor are they required to start kindergarten once they begin reporting their six-year-old.<BR>
	A student's academic progress was called into question in Highland County as a result of curriculum submitted.  However, academic progress is not measured by curriculum.  Additionally, curriculum is submitted &quot;for informational purposes only.&quot;  The superintendent does not have authority to &quot;approve&quot; curriculum.  His job is to ensure that the required subjects are being covered; not to monitor content.<BR>
	Greene County Board of Education and Xenia City Schools are at the heart of a controversy regarding their revision of home school regulations.  The controversy revolves around the language indicating that the superintendent &quot;or his designee&quot; is to receive and process notifications and, ultimately, excuse children from compulsory attendance.  The home school regulations are clear that the excuse must come from the superintendent.  This has been a matter of much debate and correspondence, and the outcome of this situation is still unclear.  Home school leaders are determining what course of action would be best.<BR>
	HSLDA recommends that Ohio home schoolers become very familiar with the provisions of the home school law in order to detect requests that exceed the law.  If you do not have a copy of our summary of the Ohio law, please contact our legal department and we will be happy to forward one to you.  <BR>

<i>Jasper County Board of Education Reverses Home Schooling Disapproval</i><BR>

<P>	The Jasper County Board of Education has reversed its earlier decision to deny six home schooling families the right to operate home schools for their children. The controversy arose when the board of education, at its meeting on August 14, 1995, voted to disapprove the home schooling applications of these families even though they met all of the legal requirements of the home school statute, Section 59-65-40 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina. No reason was given to the families in the letters notifying them of the board's decision, but a newspaper article appearing in the Jasper County Sun indicated that the decision was based upon the board's opinion that the parents did not possess the necessary qualifications to teach their children at home. Not only did the board refuse to recognize that the parents met the teacher-qualification requirements of the law, the board also failed to notify the parents of the date and time of the meeting and of their right under the home school law to speak in support of their application.<BR>
	Home School Legal Defense Association attorney Dewitt Black wrote a letter to the local superintendent on behalf of the two HSLDA member families in the group. In a later telephone conversation with Attorney Black, the local superintendent agreed to again place the applications on the agenda for the next meeting of the board scheduled for August 28, 1995. This meeting was attended by a number of the parents whose applications had been denied, and they were given an opportunity to express their objections to the board's earlier decision. The board then voted to reverse itself, and all of the home schooling families were approved for the 1995-96 school year.<BR>
	Although there is no question that home schooling is legal in South Carolina by virtue of the statute enacted in 1988, this situation in Jasper County is another example of how parents may be challenged in their right to conduct home education by public school officials who are misinformed or philosophically opposed to home education.

Congressional Action Program Volunteers Put a New Face on Lobbying<BR>

<P>	It's a cold and drizzly autumn day in Washington D.C. The patter of rain on the steps of the Senate office building is accented by the constant swish of umbrellas opening and closing as staffers and politicians scurry to their destinations. Inside the massive marble structures that house America's most prestigious legislators, decisions will be made that affect our entire nation. But that is nothing new.<BR>
	Today is a day like all other days in our nation's Capital. Today, Congress will pass laws. Today, men will make speeches, and special interests will court the favor of Hill staffers. And there will be meetings—thousands of them.<BR>
	Hundreds of yards away, a very different gathering is taking place. In the newly renovated conference room of the Holiday Inn, 60 home educators gather. Many have traveled hours to be here. They come in all ages, heights, and colors, but are absolutely unified in their theme: They have come to ask Congress to leave them alone. <BR>
	As the meeting commences a speaker takes the podium. In his lapel he is wearing a bright red pin with an embossed design of the Capitol dome—the insignia of the Congressional Action Program. His name is Doug Phillips. For three years Phillips has been preparing home educators for face-to-face meetings with Congressional leaders. And for three years these moms and dads have been travelling the corridors of Capitol Hill in pursuit of a dream—a dream that the blessings of liberty they have enjoyed will pass to their posterity.<BR>
	These families are the minutemen of the home school movement. They are a specially trained group that meets for one purpose—the defense of the home schooling family. Sometimes their visits to Washington are carefully planned weeks in advance, other times they are emergency responses to late-breaking legislation.<BR>
	Today's mission: Stop a Congressional attempt to build a nationwide computer-driven registry and tracking system. As home schoolers, these families are painfully aware of the fact that these registries can be used against parents who home educate their children, who employ corporal discipline, or who hold to religious beliefs that are unacceptable to the social workers who surf the database. Complicating matters, some leaders have called for the government to mandate a national I.D. card with a unique biometric identifier. This would mean that every time an American wanted to get a job he would have his retina scanned or his hand geometry analyzed. <BR>
	Phillips begins the debriefing. He walks the group through the key provisions of the bill. Next, he addresses the primary arguments against the tracking program. There is an opportunity for questions and answers followed by a brief time of role playing which gives the Capitol Coordinators a chance to test their familiarity with the issues.<BR>
	Last minute details are covered. Each of the teams has been given a specific assignment and handed information packets. Headquarters is established in the foyer of the Hart Senate Building. Throughout the day, volunteers can check in there, get additional information packets, and report about their meetings. <BR>
	&quot;Remember,&quot; Phillips reminds them, &quot;We will meet by that giant, ugly sculpture that hangs from the ceiling. What is that thing called anyway?&quot; <BR>
	He can never remember what that sculpture is called, but everyone knows what he's talking about. It is hard to miss.<BR>
	The meeting comes to a close. Across the room heads are bowed. Children are praying. Fathers have their arms around their wives and children. God's blessing is invoked. Forty-five minutes after the meeting began, these teams of home school families are off and running. Many will be on their feet for more than six hours before they can return to their cars and begin the long journey back to the warmth and comfort of home. <BR>
Within a ten mile circumference of this hotel room are the headquarters of more than 200 education-related organizations and special interest groups. Many of them exist on taxpayer subsidies. They have set up camp in D.C. to deliver a message: &quot;More money + more power (for them) = better education.&quot; Their jobs and their salaries depend on Congress getting this message. Like the home educators assembled in the quiet Holiday Inn meeting room, these lobbyists will be traveling today to the halls of Congress, but on the quest of a very different agenda.<BR>
	The largest of these groups, the National Education Association, would like to see home schooling banned for the average family. Their lobbyists are well-paid professionals with clout. After being routed in February of 1994 when one million parents said &quot;no&quot; to an NEA-inspired teacher certification provision in the H.R.6 bill, they are on their guard.<BR>
	The contrast between these two groups is stark. One group is comprised of professional lobbyists in search of more government hand-outs for the special interests they represent. The other consists of volunteer parents who are sacrificing time and money to appeal to legislators to make wise decisions on issues which impact the home school family. <BR>
	One chief-of-staff for a well known Democratic Senator told a CAP mom: &quot;Every day I get calls from lobbyists who want to wine me and dine me. Everybody wants a hand-out. I'm tired of it. You are the real thing. A mom who just wants to look out for her family. I'll meet with you any time!&quot; (Paraphrase)<BR>
	These families are making a difference. Often, they are the first, and sometimes even the only, people to hand-deliver outside analysis to the Representatives and Senators on key issues. <BR>
	Of course, sometimes the Congressmen just want to talk about home education. And the results are often surprising. After one visit by home schoolers, a California Congressmen called the National Center and announced that he was so impressed by the meeting that he was persuaded to home school his own children. &quot;How do I get started?&quot; he asked. <BR>
	&quot;Even if they don't agree with us on every point,&quot; Phillips mused to the Capitol Coordinators, &quot;perhaps we'll get them by attrition if we keep having visits like that.&quot; <BR>
	Most of these home schoolers were nervous the first time they entered a Congressional office. The thought of bringing an appeal directly to a United States Senator can make a first-timer quiver in his Rockports. But these home school foot soldiers quickly earn their &quot;Hill-legs.&quot; By the third or fourth visit of the day they are raring to go.<BR>
	Before these families are released as official Capitol Coordinators they must go through an intensive, one-day training program. Since January of 1993 more than 250 home educators have gone through CAP Basic Training. Many of these individuals and families have gone on to be Capitol Coordinators. For three years these stalwarts have been the marine corps of the home school movement—the first to hit the beaches, clearing the way for the calls and letters of thousands of concerned parents whenever legislative threats arise.	<BR>
	The last CAP Basic Training brought about one hundred home educators together for an intensive day of preparation. Those assembled learned about the key federal battlefronts which threaten to undermine home school freedoms and were given Scriptural insights and practical suggestions on how to present home education in the best possible light when meeting with leaders. Emphasis was placed on attitude as well as methodology. And whether the issue was the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, or &quot;how to set up a meeting with a Congressman,&quot; parents were urged to approach their mission with Christian charity and respectfulness.<BR>
	Joe Adams, chaplain of the Kentucky State Legislature, described the way he has seen the Lord work in various legislators' lives. His story is a powerful illustration how one man with faith and vision can make a difference. HSLDA President Michael Farris shared war stories from his experience as a home school litigator which illustrated God's sovereign hand of protection over the home school movement. Veteran &quot;Cappers&quot; shared their experience with the prospective lobbyists about their first visit to Capitol Hill. <BR>
	After sharing the history of the children's rights movement and its assault on the family, CAP Director Doug Phillips discussed the most common pitfalls of Christians entering the political arena. &quot;Christians enter politics to change the world for Jesus, but they end up employing the strategies of compromise and adopting the world's attitudes,&quot; Phillips told the families. &quot;We must act wisely, but all of our activities must be predicated on the understanding that God and God alone is responsible for our success. Our responsibility is simply to be obedient.&quot;<BR>
	The importance of the basic training can not be underestimated. Even so, the heart of CAP is not the training, but the people: fathers and mothers who are willing to sacrifice their time, and lead their children to &quot;stand in the gates of the nation,&quot; families who believe in an America where the sanctity of the home is inviolable, and parents who are free to raise their children in the fear and admonition of the Lord without interference from Big Brother.<BR>
	Some might be surprised to learn that the most effective members of the CAP team are the children. Over the years CAP volunteers have learned that the greatest asset during these visits are the sweet spirits and simple honesty of the students. Frequently, skeptical staffers are uninterested in what Mom and Dad have to say—they want to confront the children. But when confronted with hostile questions, these young people just speak from the heart about why they like being taught at home. Out of the mouths of these babes, the truth is often confirmed.<BR>
	And here is the interesting thing. When a family visiting a Congressional office demonstrates a unity and strength which comes from the togetherness fostered by home education, the barriers of party affiliation, race, and gender cease to be impediments to a successful meeting. Why?<BR>
	In the words of one Congressman, &quot;I will listen to you because I wish my kids loved each other the way yours seem to.&quot; An Open Letter to Home School Moms<BR>
by Michael Farris<BR>

<P>	One of the special privileges I enjoy is the opportunity to interact with thousands of home schooling parents every year at state home schooling conferences and conventions.  At every conference, people come up to me and express gratefulness and appreciation for the work of HSLDA.  I am always especially moved by those who tell me that they pray for us on a regular basis.  That means more to all of us here than can ever be adequately explained.<BR>
	But as I have been watching my wife, Vickie, begin the process of starting our family's fourteenth year in home schooling, a question suddenly occurred to me: <I>Who thanks the </I><B><I>real</I></B><I> heroes of the home schooling movement?</I><BR>
<I>	</I>Vickie is teaching five of our school-age children this year (two have graduated; two are too young).  She is teaching a total of twenty-eight subjects.  And she is washing and cooking and washing and cleaning and washing and driving and washing and shopping and washing and mending and washing—all on top of her teaching responsibilities.<BR>
	Vickie is unusual compared to the world at large.  And she is obviously uniquely special to me.  But there are another two or three hundred thousand home schooling moms who are doing essentially the same things.<BR>
	And it's my guess that these ladies—the real heroes of the home schooling movement—rarely hear words of thanks.  So let me give it a try.<BR>

<P><I>To all home schooling moms:</I><BR>

<P><I>T	hanks for being willing to sacrifice the minutes, hours, days, months, and years that constitute your life so your children will have the opportunity to grow up godly, mature, wise, intelligent, and loving.  People who give great sums of money are widely heralded as great philanthropists.  You have given something of far greater value.  You have given your children your very essence so that they may achieve the kind of greatness that God values.  Keep in mind that their only hope for achieving those character qualities is bound up in the fact that you serve the one true God who endows you with those same characteristics.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for your plain old hard work.  In the midst of a society bent on obtaining the maximum in convenience, you demonstrate that things of value are not accomplished quickly or on the first try.  You are the exemplars of the virtue of the third, fourth, and fifth tries.  If your children take your example into the American work place, our nation will rise to its former prominence as the country which succeeded because of its simple commitment to hard work.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for being willing to encourage other moms who struggle, who are new to the movement, who are discouraged, who need your counsel, your experience, or your wisdom.  The selflessness you demonstrate in the lives of your children pours over into the hours you devote so that others may succeed.  Arguably you have a vested interest in the success of your own children.  You have nothing to gain from helping others.  It is an act of pure altruism.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for your obedience to God.  Together with your husband you have read the Scriptures.  You have understood them to lead you in this path of home education.  And regardless of the costs, the difficulties, or the lack of immediate rewards or gratification, you have done what is right simply because it is right.  Few are willing to do right these days for its own sake.  You serve as an example of moral courage that our leaders would do well to copy.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for loving your husband.  Your marriage is the human foundation of your home.  When it cracks and crumbles, all that you value—including your home schooling—is threatened.  Your selfless love for your husband is an essential ingredient to keeping that foundation strong and true.</I><BR>
<I>	Thank you for taking the time to teach your children the Truth.  So much of education today ignores the truth and simply attempts to impart knowledge separated from the principles of absolute truth which flow from Almighty God.  Your children have the advantage of learning what is real and true and good.  Those things which are cheap counterfeits will always be self-evident frauds to those who have had the good fortune to spend years being exposed to the Truth.</I><BR>
<I>	And finally, thank you for being willing to swim against the stream of society's definition of success.  Stay-at-home moms are given little praise in our society today.  The &quot;mothers of the year&quot; are normally &quot;great moms,&quot; but they are really chosen because they also serve as captains of industry, public policy, or finance.  At the very time the world ridicules a mom who devotes herself exclusively to her family, you have embraced that role with even more enthusiasm than the generations who have gone before you.  Your version of &quot;having it all&quot; means shouldering all of the responsibility for the rearing of your children.</I><BR>
<I>	The feminists won't hold a women's conference in China—or anywhere else—to give you the accolades you so richly deserve.  </I><BR>
<I>	But your true reward will never be meager efforts of thanks like this letter.  Your true reward—at least the one you will see here on earth—will be children who rise up, while the rest of the world is stooping in compromise, and call you blessed with their lives, their words, and their deeds.  It is your legacy of love.  Thanks.   </I>
