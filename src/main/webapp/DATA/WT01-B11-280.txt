<B><I>Investment Objective:</I></B> To provide capital appreciation with current income as an incidental goal. The Fund currently  seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing all of its investment assets in Schroder U.S. Smaller Companies Portfolio (the "Portfolio"), a separate portfolio of a registered open-end management company with an identical investment objective. Accordingly, the Small Cap Opportunities Fund's investment experience will correspond directly with the Portfolio's investment experience, as reflected below.

<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>After several months of underperformance, small company stocks outperformed large company holdings in December, though they ended up underperforming for the year as a whole.  
<LI>For the month of December, health care, consumer staples, financial services and energy were the best performing sectors of the market.  Managed care providers such as Compdent and Healthsource were strong performers after significant weakness earlier in the quarter.  Consumer staples stocks performed well as investors fled retailers and other cyclicals in favor of more conservative consumer stocks.  Financial stocks, like Walden Bancorp, UST Corp. and Banknorth Group, outperformed in the month as earnings estimates were revised upward and merger and acquisition activity continued.  Energy stocks continued to outperform the market; this category was the best performing sector for the year with a strong 76% return.  Our overweight position in the group added to the Fund's performance during the year.
<LI>The weakest performing sectors were utilities, consumer discretionary and technology.  The Fund has no exposure to utilities.  We are overweight, however, in consumer discretionary stocks, which impacted performance during December.
<LI>Looking forward to 1997, we are optimistic about the prospects for smaller company stocks.  We believe that many small companies offer more attractive investment opportunities than larger companies based on both valuation and growth rates.
