<title>Regional Demand-Side Management Programs</title>

<H2><I>C. </I>Regional Demand-Side Management Programs Have Been Successful 
Nationwide<BR></H2>

<BR>
In response to IRP policies, billions of utility dollars have been 
diverted away from building new generation capacity. The money instead has 
gone into DSM programs to reduce demand. From 1990 to 1994, utility 
investments in DSM programs and energy efficiency tripled to $3 billion 
per year. These investments reduced national generation 2 percent per 
year, while consumers saved nearly $4 billion annually on their utility 
bills. A 1993 EPRI survey of most U.S. DSM programs<a href="#74" name="r74"> [ 74 ] </a>found that the 
programs save electricity at an average cost of just 2.1 cents per 
kilowatt-hour.<a href="#75" name="r75"> [ 75 ] </a>Utility spending on DSM programs increased dramatically 
between 1989 and 1993, growing from 0.5 to 1.5 percent of utility 
operating revenues. In 1993, U.S. electric utilities spent $2.8 billion on 
DSM programs.<a href="#76" name="r76"> [ 76 ] </a>These expenditures paid substantial benefits, including 
electricity reductions in 1993 of 44,000 gigawatt-hours and peak demand 
reductions of 40,000 megawatts. These reductions are equivalent to 1.6 
percent of annual electricity sales and 6.8 percent of summer peak demand, 
and reduced U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 27.8 million 
metric tons.<a href="#77" name="r77"> [ 77 ] </a>In 1994, utility DSM programs cut potential summer peak 
demand by 7 percent and annual electricity use by 2 percent nationwide.<BR>
<p>     Despite current uncertainties in utility markets due to industry 
restructuring, DSM programs are expected to expand, and could reduce 
national electricity demand by 3 percent annually by the year 2000. This 
continued expansion could reduce electricity generation by 71,000 
gigawatt-hours in the year 2000, preventing 44.9 million metric tons of 
carbon dioxide emissions annually.<a href="#78" name="r78"> [ 78 ] </a><BR>
<p>     Over the last decade of incorporating IRP into utility planning, 
literally hundreds of utility DSM programs have emerged. Utilities used 
DSM to retain customers, to increase market share, and to enhance 
profitability by improving customer services. DSM programs will become 
even more important in a restructured utility industry, as still-regulated 
distribution companies will select the low-cost option for providing 
energy needs. The following success stories, categorized by region, 
demonstrate the financial savings - and substantial environmental and 
health benefits - of utility efficiency programs.<P>
