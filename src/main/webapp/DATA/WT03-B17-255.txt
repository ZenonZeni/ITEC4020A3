<STRONG><H3>About Trees</H3></STRONG>
     Trees  are  very  important to this planet's  ecosystem.  They  are
essential to the earth's recycling system. They provide the very air we
need to live. They control the water cycles. They provide homes to many
different  species. They have been called the earth's  shock  absorber.
They  assimilate carbon into oxygen, they clean up the air (improve  air
quality)  and  bring water and minerals up to the surface. Reduce  water
runoff. Urban forestry helps clean up cities and raise the quality  of
life,   promoting   interaction  between  urban  dwellers   and   their
environment. Trees also reduce heat and glare.

<STRONG><H3>Why Feed Them Chemicals ?</H3></STRONG>
     The  answer is simple, trees cannot use chemicals in their system!
Trees  must be fed naturally and in accord with how the natural  system
works. Remember trees have been around for a long time.

<STRONG><H3>Proper Tree Care</H3></STRONG>
     How  to  feed  them,  then? Chemical fertilizers damage  the  soil's
ecosystem,  cause stress and lack the essential bacteria and  minerals.
Trees  require  certain conditions for proper growth and  good  health.
Proper  site selection is very important. It is important to understand
what these conditions are.  Proper tree selection for the environment it
will  be in is also important.  Before planting, amend the soil with good
rich  compost  and  lots  of humus.  Provide regular  watering.  Provide
regular composting.

<STRONG><H3>Mulch as Needed</H3></STRONG>
     Most  trees  will mulch themselves, so don't rake away  their  leaf
droppings.  Do not use any chemical fertilizer or pesticides.   Do  not
top  trees!  Go  Native when ever possible.  Hire only skilled  workers.
Remember, it cost less to keep a healthy tree then to replace it.  Save
a  tree  whenever possible. Don't cut it down; plan around and  include
the tree in your planning!

<STRONG><H3>Trees Need Water</H3></STRONG>
     Make sure that you provide adequate watering on a regular basis. A
drip  system or soaker will help. Filter the water. Use tree vents  for
deep  watering  if possible. Use a garden filter for this.  The  proper
selection of trees is important for this purpose.

<STRONG><H3>Trees Love Compost</H3></STRONG>
     Compost  is  one of the few things you can feed trees with.  Local
compost  rich with trace minerals, composted animal manure and lots  of
humus are best.  Feed yearly if possible.
Never feed trees High Nitrogen.
High nitrogen causes stress which is the main cause for pest or disease
attack. Trees get their nitrogen from the air, from the compost and
from the natural bacteria found in the soil.
