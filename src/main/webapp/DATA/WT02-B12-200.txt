<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The New York Times on September 30 included

a lengthy story on immigrants to the US who bypass central cities

and settle in suburbs. Haverstraw, New York, 30 miles north of

Manhattan, was 51 percent Hispanic in the 1990 Census, and up

to 70 percent Hispanic according to some local estimates, largely

because of chain migration from the Dominican Republic.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Over 70 percent of the children in Haverstraw

elementary schools are Latino.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A study of immigrants in suburbs concluded

that new immigrants tend to move to suburbs that are a little

rundown, less affluent than average, and already have a smaller

proportion of non-Hispanic whites than in the richer suburbs.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In March 1996, the INS apprehended 14

illegal immigrants at Poultry  Products Inc. in Manchester, New

Hampshire, including a woman who had been employed there for seven

years.  The INS estimated that there were about 1,075 illegal

immigrants in New Hampshire in October 1992--most are Mexicans

and Canadians; others were from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and

Brazil.</FONT></TT>

10,000 Hispanic residents.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Many Puerto Ricans migrated to rural

communities in the northeastern states to harvest crops, and some

settled:  the five US cities with the most Puerto Ricans are New

York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, New Jersey and Hartford,

Connecticut.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">An estimated 300,000 Puerto Ricans --

about 10 percent of the island's population -- migrated to the

US during the 1980s.</FONT></TT>
