    <TITLE>Airborne Sensing at CSIRO Water Resources</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B>1. INTRODUCTION<BR>
</B><BR>
The work done at CSIRO Division of Water Resources (DWR), based on the Itres
(Canada) CASI airborne spectral imaging instrument, is an Applications Based
systems development. This development is a package consisting of an Integrated
Airborne (spectral) Sensing (IAS) instrument, ancillary instrumentation
and processing modules. Together, these can provide high resolution information
for environmental resource assessment in a form immediately useful to end
users of the products. The Applications area defined for this IAS involves
integrating models and methods based on CSIRO DWR core knowledge and skills
with a general system comprising data collection instruments, processing
methodologies and processing hardware and software systems.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. APPLICATIONS AREA MODEL</B><BR>
The outputs of the Applications system are final products that users want
and are prepared to contract commercially to a processing service bureau.
The necessary Application template for an imaging spectrometer such as (but
not limited to) the CASI, takes into account the special circumstances provided
by a fully calibrated spectral instrument. It integrates its output with
a range of other airborne and ground based measurements and has nine main
components.<BR>
<BR>

Structure Schematic</A></I><BR>
<BR>
The subcomponents (primary processes) of this system have been studied in
a detailed form as a cost/time and work/duration processing model through
applications carried out by the established processing group at CSIRO DWR.
That model and possible extensions based on queuing theory have been investigated
at CSIRO DWR and by CSIRO DWR's commercial product developers as part of
the Applications model. This model has been set up to help manage and monitor
the progress of actual Applications projects. Figure 1 shows the main structure
of the model:<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.1</B> <B>Flight Mission (Planning and Execution)</B><BR>
Every application will have special considerations with respect to channels
chosen for targeting user needs, environmental conditions, data scale and
resolution. CSIRO DWR uses a set of software items which implement the flight
planning and measurement models. These can be used to plan prior to flights
and during the mission.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.2</B> <B>Lab and Field Data Collection &amp; </B>Processing<BR>
Some field data are collected at the time of each mission and some at other
times. Data which must be taken at the time of flights is environmental
(such as atmospheric data). Data such as characteristic spectra can be collected
at other times. Separation of field and laboratory from flying missions
is a key development in the measurement model approach being discussed here.
Software to analyse the Lab and Field data for each measurement model for
the analyses have been developed to implement this area.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.3</B> <B>Base Data </B>Processing<BR>
CASI Suppliers (Itres, Canada) software is used to take image, attitude
(roll and pitch) and GPS data from the aircraft and process them to calibrated
and (by single run) geometrically resampled images in a form ready for image
processing. There is a future need to develop software to use the GPS data
to more effectively and accurately model the attitude of the aircraft for
IAS applications. This is under development by CSIRO DWR in combination
with Itres and the CSIRO DWR commercial product developers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.4 Mosaicking and Normalisation</B><BR>
The Base Processed airborne sensor data are assembled into mosaicks and
atmospherically corrected in this component. Atmospheric correction means
the data from different runs and times become normalised to surface reflectance.
Only real differences in surface reflectance are left. At the heart of this
process is an integrated spectral and geometric model for the data. This
model is also the basis for fusion of the data with other data types - such
as satellite data, other airborne data and GIS data at various scales.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.5 Image Processing</B><BR>
The necessary functions of the image processing system can be fully described
by function rather than by options in any single image processing system.
At present, microBRIAN (MPA and CSIRO developed software) is being used
for the CASI based prototype Projects. The use of this specific software
for an advanced IAS is sufficient but not necessary. CSIRO DWR supervising
software exists for the current system which makes processing tasks quicker
and minimises operator action.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.6 Measurement Models</B><BR>
The primary taxonomy of 'applications' from the Application system point
of view is by measurement model. At present there are an atmospheric and
six main surface measurement models:<BR>
n water bodies and water covered targets (eg sea grass, reefs, water quality)<BR>
n dense woody vegetation (eg forests &amp; mangroves)<BR>
n open forests &amp; woodlands (eg woody weeds)<BR>
n short grass and crops (eg crops and grasslands)<BR>
n bare targets (eg soils)<BR>
n (modulated by) flat and sloping ground effects<BR>
The measurement models provide the link between the parameters of interest
and concern to the user and those of direct significance in forming the
signal measured by the instrument. The CASI measures radiance in the visible
and near infrared so that CASI measurement models involve primarily radiative
transfer and scattering in the surface layer and atmosphere. However, users
want to know parameters of the surface such as canopy cover and structure,
soil moisture, water use, levels of phytoplankton in water bodies, benthic
community type or suspended sediments concentration. The measurement models
provide the scale and physical basis for these transfers from CASI data
to the information required by the end user.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.</B>7 <B>Measurement Model Knowledge Base</B><BR>
This area includes a Spectral Library and associated environmental information.
The data structure and methodology for the Spectral Data Base has been developed
at CSIRO DWR. The Measurement Model Knowledge Base, together with software
called the 'Data Calculator', form base tools for the measurement models
and applications. In particular, a spectral library is a primary tool for
template matching and data modelling.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.</B>8 <B>GIS Integration</B><BR>
The system needs two-way access to GIS data and tools. The image processing
component must also have adequate data integration tools to do this. Currently,
CASI based Projects interface to ArcInfo and GRASS. This component can,
however, be any adequate commercial GIS system. There is benefit in it being
off-the-shelf. In land operations, this area of the Applications Model must
also provide the best current DTM system data as well as cadastral information.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.</B>9 <B>Interpretation</B><BR>
Interpretation is the action of merging the information and products of
modelling and image processing to derive the final products in the terms
the end user needs. It involves skilled and experienced scientists labelling
classes, attaching numerical levels and statistics and generating keys and
summaries. The interpretation depends on the Application and on the type
of models that have been employed. This area is a key component in the Applications
based approach and the accumulated experience here will grow as an asset
of any commercial implementation of the model. Final results will normally
be included in a developing GIS and build a base of decision support for
future missions to use.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.10 Applications Products</B><BR>
This area involves Report Generation, product generation and annotation
and product delivery and presentation. This area can use existing hardware
and software, the tools in the Image Processing System and the GIS system
as well as new software. In the current CASI based prototype, most of these
functions are provided by the microBRIAN image processing system, CorelDraw
and standard publication tools such as Microsoft Word, Chartist and MathType.<BR>
We can itemise the current set of specialised product areas for the Applications
under five headings. These are: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Coastal zone monitoring and mapping 
<LI>Reef and seagrass mapping and monitoring 
<LI>Water quality mapping and monitoring 
<LI>Forest monitoring and mapping 
<LI>Plant community determination and monitoring. 
</UL>

<B>3. IMPLEMENTATION</B><BR>
In projects undertaken at CSIRO DWR, the system described above has been
implemented by a well equipped and trained team of remote sensing specialists.
The cost structures have been analysed as well as processing management
and potential efficiencies identified. There is now a very good processing
management and planning model which can be keyed into a commercial business
plan to provide effective commercial planning and management. This established
team and its commercial product developers are equipped to work together
with other service groups throughout our region.<BR>
The current systems implementation and structure is under review with the
commercial product developers and has a number of efficiency and throughput
goals which will improve commercial operations. <BR>
