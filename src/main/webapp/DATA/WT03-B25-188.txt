Change Like An Art</H1>

<P>Early on it went something like this: &quot;<I>Nothing endures but change</I>.&quot;Heraclitus.

<P>However, in a more contemporary context, it sounds more like: &quot;There's nothing more constant than change.&quot; And just as this is true of life, it's just as true of making things: why are there so many different car makers all making so many different cars? Because the buying public's taste, its estimate or notion of what's grand, sublime, or just cool, is as slippery as mercury (tail fins once--you bet; smooth jelly bean shapes now--who'd have guessed?). And needs change. And what's allowable changes. Rules, those of making things and those of using them, change. Everything, including (and especially) opinion, changes.

<P>But perhaps the type of change discussed most often in the pages of this magazine and others (outside of design issues), is organizational change. Some call it reengineering (and to many just hearing the phrase strikes fear into the heart: &quot;The Reengineering Team is coming to spend some time with 
our department. It's been nice knowing you.&quot;)

<P>Others call it internal benchmarking.

<P>Others, corporate revisioning or reinvention.

<P>Whatever it's called, it has to do with changing corporate structure and behavior. In order to face change. To managing change. To try to anticipate change (especially that of ones' competitors). And to do all of this while avoiding risk.

<P>Which is a notion that most would agree doesn't make sense (you've got to risk if you're truly going to change, because the nature of change characteristically and inherently involves the unknown as result: the new thing is not the old thing. If it is, change hasn't happened. What might have happened, at best, is adaptation). But few--if you really look deep down inside yourself, inside your organization--willingly step off into change without thought of the potential 
risk--<I>and failure</I>.

<P>Which is human nature. And organizational nature, as well. We all seek security and predictability. For example, an employee who isn't &quot;predictable&quot; is... what? Unstable? A risk? Someone to watch closely? Someone who might just &quot;change,&quot; and thus become...what?

<P>Perhaps. But this in its own way may be wrong-headed thinking. The employee who isn't &quot;predictable&quot; may be entirely stable, but just highly creative. And in this, a change agent. One who can lead the way through the waves of change. (This is not, how-ever, to say that the employee who is predictably un-predictable is not an issue for concern. He or she is.)

<P>Three things you don't want to do regarding organizational change: One, ignore it. Two, deny it (both of these will result in your doing something other than you're doing now and probably liking it less). And three, go about making change recklessly.

<P>There are things you can do to smooth the way through change. You can check the vast body of literature on the subject. You can go to conferences, seminars, and trade shows. There are consultants you can hire to guide you through changethe likes of the folks at Ingersoll Engineers (Rockford, IL) or Andersen Consulting (Chicago, IL). Or you can, of course, read this magazine for advice and counsel. 

<P>But when it all comes down to dealing with change, perhaps the best advice is this: Never <I>play</I> at change. Change, like war, is an art. And once you engage in change, you must firmly remember to go with it to the very end. However, unlike war, the art of change, like change itself, never ends.
