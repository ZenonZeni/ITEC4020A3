  This paper presents a study of two intellectually gifted students (ages 6 and 
14) who have cerebral palsy and are unable to communicate orally.  Results of 
participant observation, interviews, and document analysis revealed that: (1) 
gifted students who have cerebral palsy and do not speak exhibit indicators of 
cognitive ability that are similar to those exhibited by nondisabled gifted 
students, though the expression and recognition of these indicators are 
inhibited by communication barriers; (2) classroom atmosphere, structures, and 
instructional activities differentially impact the intellectual development of 
gifted students with physical disabilities; (3) gifted students with physical 
disabilities are able, with some modifications, to integrate and succeed 
academically and socially in regular classrooms; and (4) many barriers must be 
overcome by gifted students with physical disabilities in order to reach their 
goals.  The study demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the obvious 
external manifestations of intellectual talent and illustrates some unique 
behaviors that may appear given appropriate circumstances.  (Contains 22 
references.) (JDD) <BR>

This study compared 10 gifted and 10 average children in each elementary  grade for
higher level cognitive writing processes and lower level  transcription processes.
Results indicated that gifted and average children  differed in the higher level cognitive
processes but not in the lower level  writing processes.  Results have implications for
identifying writing-related  learning disabilities in gifted students.  (Author/DB)<BR>
