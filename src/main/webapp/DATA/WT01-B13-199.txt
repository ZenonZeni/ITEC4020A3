<H3>"20-SOMETHINGS" NO SLACKERS WHEN IT COMES TO RETIREMENT PLANNING, 
ACCORDING TO KEMPER-ROPER RETIREMENT MONITOR</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (June 15) - When it comes to retirement, Americans in their 20s
shatter the "slacker" myth of being lost and living for the now,
according to a poll released today by Kemper and Roper-Starch Worldwide.
<P>

The "Kemper-Roper Retirement Monitor" polled 2,086 randomly selected
Americans about their attitudes and expectations regarding retirement.
The survey included representation from demographic age groups
including: 20-Somethings (aged 20-29), Baby Boomers (aged 30-49),
Pre-retirees (aged 50-64) and Retirees (aged 65 and older). The survey
has a margin of error of plus/minus two percent.
<P>

"The so-called '20-Something' generation shows surprising sophistication
about issues pertaining to planning, saving, and investing for
retirement," said William E. Chapman II, executive vice president of
Kemper. "They are cognizant of their responsibility to plan, are willing
to hold off on personal consumption in order to save for retirement, and
have thought seriously about their future and their retirement."
<P>

<B>Among the survey's key findings:</B>
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Half (50%) of 20-Somethings said they had started putting money away for
retirement within the last one to five years. In contrast, 40% of Baby
Boomers aged 40 to 44, and 35% of Boomers aged 45 to 49, waited until at
least their 30s to start saving for retirement.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
61% of Americans in their 20s said they or their spouse had put money
aside for retirement in either savings or investments, while 71% of Baby
Boomers said the same.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
58% of 20-Somethings said they or their spouse had put money into a
401(K), somewhat more than 52% of the Baby Boomers who indicated that
they had done so.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Roughly three out of four 20-Somethings said that retirement is a
priority in their savings plan; 20-Somethings are as likely as Baby
Boomers to say that retirement is something they think a great deal
about. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
20-Somethings (55%) were as likely as Baby Boomers (53%) to say they are
prepared to reduce personal spending now in order to save for
retirement.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
About one in four 20-Somethings reported that they had increased the
amount of money they put into retirement savings during the past year;
39% of Baby Boomers reported doing the same.
