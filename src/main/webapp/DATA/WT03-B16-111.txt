This first of three volumes is one of the important books of the Nineties.
Ackerman is attempting to rescue the Constitution and the Court from their
modernist commentators and to return them to the Founders. To do that he
has to define just what was created in 1787, or more precisely what the
&quot;We The People&quot; of the title did by adopting the Constitution.<BR>
<BR>
The first thesis of the book is that &quot;We the People&quot; by the Constitution
created a dual system of politics, composed of: (1) normal politics or the
day-to-day operations of the system where decisions are made by the representatives
of the People who should never be confused with The People themselves; and
(2) higher lawmaking in which &quot;We the People&quot; act ourselves to
make what Ackerman calls transformations in the system. The function of
checks and balances, including judicial review, is to preserve the higher
law's assumptions, procedures, and values until We the People change them
at some future date.<BR>
<BR>
The dual system means that Ackerman does not have to square judicial review
with democracy. Of course, the Court blocks efforts by the legislative majority
to go beyond the values of the Constitution. Of course, the Court even frustrates
the desires of popular majorities when they have not gone through the steps
necessary to move their lawmaking from the normal to the higher arena. That
is the purpose of the dual system and no apologies need be offered for the
Court's actions.<BR>
<BR>
So far, the argument is in the tradition of Federalist #78. However, Ackerman
is not arguing for a static interpretation of the Constitution nor is he
arguing that original intent always governs what the Court should do. There
have been three trans- forming periods in American basic law, periods in
which higher law was changed, values were altered, and interpretations of
the Constitution modified. The first is that of the founding itself, the
second is the adoption of the Civil War Amendments, and the third is the
ratification of the New Deal by the Court. A trans- forming period must
meet certain criteria. As he puts it:<BR>
<BR>
Before gaining the authority to make supreme law in the name of the People,
a movement's political partisans must, first, convince an extraordinary
number of their fellow citizens to take their proposed initiative with a
seriousness that they do not normally accord to politics; second, they must
allow their opponents a fair opportunity to organize their own forces; third,
they must convince a majority of their fellow Americans to support their
initiative as its merits are discussed time and again, in the deliberative
fora provided for &quot;higher lawmaking.&quot; (p. 6.)<BR>

Ackerman is doing more than saying the transformations are revolutions in
the same sense that Jefferson called his election a revolution, a major
reorientation brought about without guns. There is a fourth characteristic
that he mentions but fails to require which makes these transformations
different from Jefferson's election: illegal or improper behavior. The Consti-
tution was adopted by means that the Articles of Confederation would identify
as illegal or extralegal. There are still those who contend that the Civil
War Amendments were adopted through the use of force contrary to the meaning
of Article V. And the New Deal was ratified as a response to threats to
the institu- tional integrity of the Court, threats that were real even
though they did not come to fruition. There is an element of force in each
of these transformations that is missing in the changes resulting from mere
realigning elections.<BR>
<BR>
The problem for the Court in all of this is adaptation to the transformations.
Only the adoption of the Constitution was a repudiation of the past. The
Civil War amendments retained the property rights value of the founding
while repudiating the slavery value. The New Deal retained the Bill of Rights
value from the founding period and the human rights value of the Civil War
Amendments while rejecting the strong property rights value of both periods.
Courts have had to interpret these changes to weave the new in with the
old. The Court begins by accommodating the narrow, literal effect of the
transformation while retaining as much as possible from the earlier period,
as in the SLAUGHTER- HOUSE CASES for instance. Then a broader interpretation
is offered as the date of the transformation recedes into the past and the
judges are no longer those who participated in the change. Thus we get a
LOCHNER or we get GRISWOLD V. CONNECTICUT as an extension of the New Deal
transformation.<BR>
<BR>
One other major thesis is in the book. If the New Deal is a transformation,
it cannot be the mere return to the Constitution or return to John Marshall
that Ackerman asserts conventional wisdom labels it. The only way that it
can be something new is to argue that the post-Civil War transformation
was an adoption of new values which were accepted in their time and then
that the New Deal changed in a direction other than backwards. The Civil
War Amendments were designed to eradicate slavery while still retaining
the idea of protection of property; they were designed to define slaves
out of the category of property. A decision such as LOCHNER, rather than
being an aberration, is correct. The New Deal transformation goes forward
as a transformation in the sense of ratifying the activist, redistributing,
less proper- ty oriented national government.<BR>
<BR>
There is a major problem with the New Deal as a transformation. The shift
from the Articles to the Constitution is clear, unarguable, and a major
exercise of &quot;higher law mak- ing.&quot; The shift made by the Civil
War Amendments is clear, unarguable, and a major exercise of &quot;higher
law making.&quot; In both cases We the People made it abundantly clear that
we knew what we were doing (even though some of us did it reluctantly in
the second period). It is not all that clear that the transformation called
the New Deal was as clear, unarguable, or even an exercise of &quot;higher
law making.&quot; The 1932 and 1936 elections are offered as evidence that
the requirement for a &quot;deep and sustained popular commitment&quot;
(p. 108), a &quot;deep and<BR>

considered support&quot; (p. 195) had been met by Roosevelt. Given the vagueness
and lack of a coherent program in the New Deal and given everything we know
about the vagaries of voting behavior, it is hard to accept an election
or two as a transformation of the magnitude that Ackerman is talking about
here. FDR attacked the Court and the Court changed.<BR>
<BR>
If the evidence that We the People knew what we were up to is soft, we also
failed to make sure that the FORM of what we did was clearly transformative.
There was only the &quot;switch in time&quot; to mark the transformation
and judicial precedents do not have the same finality to them that adoptions
of Constitutions or amendments do. Let me put this another way. The thing
that appears to make the New Deal transformative and the election of Thomas
Jefferson in 1800 not transformative is that the Court did not change any
of its interpretations for Jefferson and it did change for Roosevelt. I
believe it is correct that Jefferson's election was not transforming. I
need more persuasion that Roosevelt's was. The New Deal just does not seem
to fit the requirements that Ackerman sets forth for a transformation.<BR>
<BR>
A final troubling aspect of the New Deal transformation is recognized by
Ackerman but it does not cause him to question whether the transformation
took place. The lack of formality in this transformation has made it possible
for there to be &quot;transformative appointments&quot; in the Reagan-Bush
years that threaten to reverse the New Deal understandings without the sort
of debate and action by We the People that Ackerman wants. Neither the founding
nor the Civil War transformations could be reversed by judicial appointments;
the New Deal one can. Ackerman says that this suggests that We the People
have become unimaginative in expressing our wishes. Alternatively it could
be that We the People wanted out of the Depression and did not really consider
the effects of what we were doing; we did not call for a regime change but
merely short term action.<BR>
<BR>
This is an important and tightly argued book. It teems with ideas and challenges
to conventional wisdom. It, by a return to the Founders and the discussion
of the dual system of politics, solves the problem of the place of the Court
in the American system of government even though many will not like the
solution. It will cause a rethinking of the effect of the New Deal. Is it
really a return to the Founding or does it mark the beginning of a new regime?
Finally, Ackerman may trigger a more structured and less ideological discussion
of the legitimacy of presidential attempts to make major changes in interpretation
by mere appoint- ments to the federal courts. Volume II, TRANSFORMATIONS,
and Volume III, INTERPRETATIONS, will round out Ackerman's argument.<BR>
