<p align="center"><b>Congressman Barney Frank Introduces Federal
Legislation To Make Marijuana Available By Prescription</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; U.S. Representative
Barney Frank (D-MA) introduced a federal medical marijuana bill
in Congress on November 10 that would permit physicians to
prescribe marijuana to patients for a number of serious
illnesses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Frank medical use bill is modeled closely after a 1981
federal medical marijuana proposal co-sponsored at that time by
Rep. Newt Gingrich, now Speaker of the House, and three other Republicans.&nbsp;
The bill would reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule
II and would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services
to provide for controlled domestic cultivation to provide a legal
supply of medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although much more research is needed, it is clear from both
limited scientific data and rapidly accumulating anecdotal
evidence that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and
suffering for patients with a number of serious ailments, and
that it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines
for which it may be substituted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming the nausea and
vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapy as well as the nausea and
loss of appetite associated with the wasting syndrome of AIDS.&nbsp;
It is useful for various spastic conditions including multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia.&nbsp; It lowers
interocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle
glaucoma.&nbsp; For some people with epilepsy, it is the only
anticonvulsant that works.&nbsp; It has been used for centuries as
an analgesic and its medical potential has been endorsed by both
the National Academy of Sciences and the Australian Commonwealth
Department of Human Services and Health.&nbsp; In 1988, DEA Chief
Administrative Law Judge Francis J. Young declared that marijuana
fulfilled the legal requirements for currently accepted medical
use in the United States, finding marijuana to be &quot;one of
the safest therapeutically active substances known to
man.&quot;&nbsp; His order was overruled, not by any medical
authority, but by the DEA itself. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Results from a recent poll conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union demonstrate that 85 percent of the voting public
favor the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; Thirty-six states have
adopted legislation facilitating the medical use of marijuana,
but none of these state measures can be implemented until
Congress amends the law.&nbsp; The introduction of Rep. Frank's
legislation provides Congress with that opportunity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using
marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though they
must risk arrest to obtain and use it.&nbsp; As a result,
informal &quot;buyer's clubs&quot; have formed in many cities to
supply marijuana to the seriously ill.&nbsp; Some of these clubs
are small and almost clandestine; a few, such as the one in San
Francisco, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a
regular basis.&nbsp; The fact that thousands of seriously ill
Americans would risk arrest to obtain marijuana as a medicine
attests to the need for medical marijuana legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harvard Professor Lester Grinspoon M.D., co-author of Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine (Yale University Press, 1993) says the
Frank medical marijuana bill &quot;is a compassionate and humane
proposal which would provide relief from pain and suffering to
thousands of seriously ill Americans.&nbsp; These are people with
life-threatening illnesses who cannot obtain relief with
available medication.&nbsp; It is both unscientific and
unconscionable for the federal government to continue to deny an
effective medication to these patients.&nbsp; Rep. Frank's
proposal would allow this decision to be made by the patient and
the treating physician.&quot;</p>
