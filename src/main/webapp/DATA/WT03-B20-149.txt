<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>



<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="piechart295.jpeg">Members of the ERS have instant access to RSSL&#39;s multidisciplinary laboratories, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Since its initiation in 1987 the ERS has helped many companies by the provision of analytical and information support during a wide variety of product emergencies in over 1000 cases. The type of case dealt with by the ERS varies widely, but can be classified generally as investigations of serious customer complaints, <A HREF="taint.html">taints and off-flavour</A>, packaging/processing problems, <A HREF="foreign.html">foreign body analysis</A>, threatened or actual tamper and extortion, <A HREF="authenticity.html">authenticity</A>, counterfeiting and <A HREF="pesticide.html">pesticide residue analysis</A>. Many of these investigations involve the full range of analytical services available through RSSL, and demand the expertise of scientists able to address unique and novel problems with an appropriate analytical response and rapid turnaround.</P>
<P>Where required the ERS acts as a focal point and coordinator of a network of agencies providing a variety of associated services including medical, forensic and poisons information.</P>
There is a <A HREF="brochure.html">brochure</A> available.</P>
