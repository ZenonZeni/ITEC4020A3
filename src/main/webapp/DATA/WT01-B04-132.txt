<H2><CENTER>DRUGS, NEEDLES, AND HARM</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER>by Alan Markwood<BR>
June, 1996</CENTER>
<P>Needle Exchange Programs are among the most heavily promoted applications
of<BR>
&quot;Harm Reduction.&quot;  The theory of &quot;Harm Reduction&quot; is
that drug use can be made more<BR>
safe, as an alternative to drug abstinence.  Needle Exchange Programs (NEPs)
seek to<BR>
prevent HIV infection by providing clean needles to intravenous users of
illegal drugs.<BR>
<BR>
NEP advocates claim that NEPs save lives by lowering HIV infection rates.<BR>
 Evaluation studies have been equivocal.  NEP opponents state that any apparent
positive results<BR>
are flawed, and a  Montreal study indicates NEP participants had higher
rates of HIV infection<BR>
than non-NEP addicts.<BR>
<BR>
Three common flaws are:<BR>
<BR>
(1)  Failure to separate effects of NEPs from effects of concurrent<BR>
interventions such as drug treatment and HIV/AIDS education.<BR>
(2)  Failure to monitor sickness, injuries, and deaths resulting from<BR>
continuation of drug use among NEP participants.<BR>
(3)  Failure to compare NEP effects to alternatives known to be effective,<BR>
particularly aggressive outreach and drug treatment.<BR>
<BR>
The true effects of NEPs may take many years to sort out.  Based on the<BR>
current state of knowledge, even the best designed and best administered
NEPs will probably be<BR>
found to increase drug deaths more than they decrease HIV infection, particularly
in<BR>
comparison to outreach and drug treatment.<BR>
<BR>
Given this dismal scenario, why are proponents and opponents of NEPs so<BR>
concerned and vociferous?  The reason is ideology.  &quot;Harm reduction&quot;
in general, and NEPs<BR>
in particular, is a major battleground between those of us who believe illicit
drug use to be an<BR>
anti-social act (due to drug-induced health problems, violence, negligent
injury, negligent<BR>
parenting, and destruction of pro-social values) versus those who believe
that drug use is merely a<BR>
lifestyle issue.<BR>
<BR>
A stunning example of how fully the drug culture permeates &quot;harm reduction&quot;<BR>
and NEPs appeared in a recent day-long workshop given by Mr. Dan Bigg, who
operates a major NEP<BR>
in Chicago. Printed material composed and distributed by Mr. Bigg clearly
presents drug<BR>
use as acceptable, unlike drug abuse, which he defines as drug use that
produces &quot;unwanted<BR>
harm.&quot;  In other words, until the user perceives harm to self or others,
use is acceptable.<BR>
Similarly, he defines recovery as &quot;Any positive change as a person
describes it for her/himself.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Bigg's handout sheet titled &quot;Essential Ingredients of a Harm Reduction<BR>
Program&quot; starts with, &quot;Orientation toward the person seeking help
as the expert in the direction<BR>
and intensity of their own positive change(s).&quot;  Again, harm is only
that which is perceived by the<BR>
drug user.  Accordingly, another &quot;essential ingredient&quot; is &quot;Definitions
of program<BR>
completion and success that include the continued use of alcohol and other
drugs.&quot;  The point is clear.<BR>
Drug use is not aproblem unless the user decides it's a problem.<BR>
<BR>
Another handout from Mr. Bigg is titled &quot;Some Comparisons Between Typical<BR>
Drug Treatment and Substance Use Management.&quot;  What are these comparisons?
 For &quot;process,&quot;<BR>
typical drug treatment uses &quot;coercion&quot; while substance use management
uses<BR>
&quot;clarification.&quot;  For employers,&quot; typical drug treatment
employs &quot;drug-free workers,&quot; while<BR>
substance use management employs &quot;drug-abuse free workers.&quot;  For
&quot;outcome,&quot; typical drug<BR>
treatment aims for a &quot;drug-free state,&quot; while substance abuse
management aims for a &quot;happy,<BR>
productive, stable existence regardless of drug use.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Another handout created and distributed by Mr. Bigg is titled &quot;Typical
Goals<BR>
of Substance Use Management (as selected by the person seeking help).&quot;
 Of the three goals<BR>
listed, two are covered briefly:<BR>
<BR>
* &quot;Abstinence:  As people freely define it for themselves (may include
one or<BR>
more drugs and be permanent or of a limited period.)&quot;<BR>
<BR>
* &quot;Improved:  Health, Relationships, Job Performance . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The third goal, &quot;Developing and Enacting a Safer Use Plan,&quot; is
more<BR>
extensively discussed.  Sub-headings include &quot;Practicing Safer Drug
Use,&quot;  &quot;Preparing Yourself for Use,&quot; and &quot;Creating a
Safer Drug Use Environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Other material distributed by Mr. Bigg continues along the same lines, as
did<BR>
comments he made in the course of the presentation.  A slide show included
demonstrations of<BR>
how to find good veins to inject, how to cook heroin, etc.<BR>
<BR>
This is all very disturbing, but perhaps most disturbing is the acceptance
of<BR>
&quot;harm reduction&quot; and NEPs by legitimate authorities.  Mr. Bigg
presented this material in Peoria,<BR>
Illinois on May 22, 1996, at a presentation sponsored by the local Health
Department, and widely<BR>
promoted by that department.  The presentation was accredited by the Illinois
Chapter of the<BR>
National Association of Social Workers, and by the Illinois Alcohol and
Other Drug Abuse<BR>
Professional Certification Association!  When I wrote to these three organizations,
I received no<BR>
response except from the credentialing association.  The Executive Director
pointed out that the<BR>
organization, &quot;doesn't endorse, support or approve the content of any
training.&quot;  The Director has<BR>
received &quot;numerous calls from Association members complaining about
his (Mr. Bigg's)<BR>
presentations and disagreeing with the content.&quot;  Still, they feel
the absurdity of the ideas speak for<BR>
themselves, without need for censorship by the Association.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Harm reduction&quot; and NEPs are publicly promoted as having pragmatic
value,<BR>
but Mr. Bigg's presentation demonstrated that the defining characteristic
here is not a<BR>
concern for effective results, but a firm belief that drug use is fine.
 <BR>
<BR>
I would encourage all responsible persons and groups to disavow any support<BR>
for this.  I particularly believe that support for this so-called &quot;harm
reduction&quot;<BR>
movement is absolutely incompatible with legitimate drug abuse prevention
and treatment entities.<BR>
Because of the support &quot;harm reduction&quot; has already received,
active opposition is needed<BR>
from those of us who believe that illegal drug use IS an anti-social act.<BR>
