<H1>Renewable Energy</H1>
<H4>The Energy Foundation will support policy research and advocacy to accelerate the commercialization of renewable energy. The foundation is especially interested in regional initiatives to encourage utility investments in renewable energy through scenario-building, regulatory work, and advocacy. The foundation may also support research and education to build the analytic base for new federal and state policies.</H4>

Renewable energy technologies-wind, solar-thermal, photovoltaics, and biomass-made major advances in the past decade. With forward-looking policies they could play a strong role in meeting future U.S. energy needs. Renewable energy costs have dropped several-fold while reliability and performance have improved dramatically. The cost of wind-generated electricity in the U.S. dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1980 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1994, which is cheaper than coal and competitive with natural gas. The cost curves for utility-scale solar-thermal and photovoltaic plants show similar downward trends. Increased production would further reduce costs.
<P>
A few states have taken the lead in removing regulatory and financial barriers to renewable energy development. In 1994, Minnesota called on utilities to build over 800 megawatts - equivalent to a coal plant - of renewable energy projects, to ensure, in part, that a stronger renewable energy industry will develop. Utilities in Texas, California, Oregon, Massachusetts, and New York have committed to renewable energy projects. In each case, policy-makers realized that renewable energy is a viable source of power whose future availability depends on today's support.
