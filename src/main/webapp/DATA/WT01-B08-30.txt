<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Free Round Fares To The
&nbsp;Uk For All Falklanders</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>PORT STANLEY.(MP).-</strong> Every
man, woman and child in the Falkland Islands will be entitled to
a free round fare to Britain to enjoy holidays abroad. The
announcement was made by Andrew Gurr, CEO of the islands, who
said the decision followed a recommendation by a team of British
experts who made a special report on the terms and employment
conditions of the Civil Service.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The program already has the support from
all the elected members of the Legislative Council, and consists
of three consecutive annual vouchers of £ 315 which will then be
exchanged for a round fare, equivalent to £ 940, which is the
cost of traveling to Britain via Ascension Island on the RAF Tri
Star. To fly through Punta Arenas/Santiago on DAP/British Airways
costs an additional £ 25, but islanders will be able to choose.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Hay report describes the vacations
initiative as a necessary &quot;<em>cultural opening</em>&quot;,
while Andrew Gurr considered it the best way to distribute wealth
among islanders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;<em>We can't enforce a negative
income tax system, but we can make a fair distribution of the
growing income from fishing, both among those who work for the
government and those who don'</em>t&quot;, said Gurr.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Since the enforcement of the fishing
exclusion zone round the islands in 1985, the Falklands have had
annual budget surplus and reserves invested in Britain exceed 180
million US dollars for a population of just 2.300 islanders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But both Mr. Gurr and several Councilors,
as well as the Hay report, do not deny a political motive also
behind the decision: to increase and perpetuate the strong links
with Britain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nor surprisingly the decision was taken
when the islands are in the threshold of a possible oil bonanza
and when the Foreign Office is pressing the islands for a gradual
&quot;<em>normalization</em>&quot; of links with Argentina. </font></p>
