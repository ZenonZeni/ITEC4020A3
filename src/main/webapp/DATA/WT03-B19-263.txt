<P>
Business Victoria actively seeks the establishment of business projects in Victoria by overseas companies. These may include stand-alone projects by overseas companies as well as projects which involve Victorian and overseas companies working in partnership.

As international strategic partnering arrangements are an effective method for many firms to expand business relationships and activities in todays open international trading environment, particular effort is made to promote these relationships between overseas and Victorian companies.

This is effected primarily by marketing specific business proposals which are being offered by Victorian companies which are seeking an overseas business partner.

<I>Investment assistance</I>
<P>
Business Victoria provides packages of facilitative and financial assistance to attract significant new investments to Victoria.
<P>
Projects assisted need to offer significant net economic benefits, particularly in terms of export or import substitution, and will generally be in key industry sectors.
<P>
Assistance will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis in advance of the investment decision, and packages negotiated will have regard to Victoria's competitive position and the net economic benefit to Victoria.
<P>
The overriding objective of providing financial assistance to new investors, both from overseas and domestically, is to attract significant investments in trade-exposed and key industry sectors which would otherwise have been lost to the State.
<P>
The following guidelines are used in assessing investment proposals:
<P>
<ul>
<li>the investments proposed for assistance must be significant and incremental to Victoria;
<li>investors and projects will be assessed for financial viability;
<li>in all cases, the level of assistance will reflect Victorias competitive position and net economic and financial benefits to Victoria;
<li>types of assistance envisaged include grants to offset payroll and land tax, provision of infrastructure and assistance with training.
</ul>
<p>
In providing financial assistance, the Government will enter into suitable contractual arrangements, and in particular, provide for:
<ul>
<li> payment on performance; and
<li>whole or partial recovery of assistance in the event of subsequent non-performance.
</ul>
<p>
The names of the enterprises assisted and the extent of assistance will be published annually.

<I>Business Skills Migration Program</I>
<P>
Successful overseas entrepreneurs and senior executives intending to live permanently in Victoria can do so through the Commonwealth Government's Independent Business Skills Migration Program.
<P>
Applicants must be able to fulfil requirements based on business attributes, age, English language proficiency and capital. Upon being granted approval, business skills migrants are given three years to establish a business in Australia. In 1995, two new subclasses were introduced whereby applicants can apply on the strength of their business established in Australia or on the basis of their investment in three-year non-redeemable State Government Bonds.
<P>
Applications to migrate can be lodged in Australia or at the nearest Australian Embassy, Consulate or High Commission in the applicants country.
<P>
In a limited number of cases, applicants who are marginally disqualified by the Commonwealth Governments criteria can seek Victorian State sponsorship from Business Victoria. State-sponsored applicants are required to establish a business in Victoria within a year of their arrival in Australia.
<P>
Business Victoria operates a one-stop-shop Business Skills Migration unit which can provide appropriate settlement and business advice to assist business skills migrants who have chosen to settle in Victoria. Business Victoria also arranges exploratory visits for potential applicants interested in immigrating to Victoria.
