RECOGNIZING DIFFERENCES: CCUL MAY CONTEST UNITY WITH ITS STATE
REGULATOR

The California Credit Union League warned its state regulator it
will fight the merger of credit union regulatory responsibilities into the
state's banking department unless it can guarantee the industry won't be
treated like banks.
        Among CCUL's concerns are retaining specialized examiners,
increased operating fees, sustaining relations with NCUA including
protecting state authority from federal encroachment and assurance that the
new regulator will promote the league's legislative agenda.
        The State of California Department of Corporations, Business and
Transportation Agency promulgated a proposal to transfer regulatory and
supervisory duties for credit unions, presently within the DoC, to the
Department of State Banking.
        John Annaloro, the league's senior vice president of public and
government relations, told California's DoC in a Dec. 9 letter that the
league's concerns "at a minimum, would have to be resolved to our complete
satisfaction before credit unions could consider supporting any
consolidation effort."
        CCUL is fighting a battle that 44 other states tussled with and
lost--but not necessarily to their detriment. "Consolidation isn't
necessarily awful. The key is the supervision has to be credit union
specific," Doug Duerr, president and CEO of the National Association of
State Credit Union Supervisors, told NCUA Watch. He said the change can be
positive because it provides additional resources, i.e. investment product
expertise and greater access to legal counsel.
        The states that still have stand-alone credit union departments are
Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas and Puerto Rico.
        CCUL said the Department of Corporations is against the changeover,
but the move has the backing of powerful state legislators, including the
chairs of both the Assembly and Senate banking committees.
        While no specific legislation to advance this action in California
exists now, Robert Arnould, director of legislative affairs for CCUL, said
he will meet with California Gov. Pete Wilson's office to uncover his
intentions.
        Arnould said "the proposal is part of a broader package to
streamline and bring efficiency to state government." He said the
governor's office is very anxious to hear CCUL's concerns and it's not
really interested in moving forward unless the credit union industry has
support. "I don't think they want a big fight with the industry. They are
aware of our lobbying abilities."
        CCUL also conducted a survey among state-licensed credit unions
regarding their satisfaction with the DoC and their willingness to consider
consolidation. The study found most state credit unions would rather be
regulated by the DoC than NCUA. It also concluded most larger credit unions
opposed a merger while medium and smaller CUs supported it.
        CCUL said the merger would be detrimental to credit unions if the
new regulatory authority didn't learn the distinctions of nonprofit goals
vs. the competitive goals of for-profit banking.
        Other critical subjects CCUL broached were federal deposit
insurance and generally accepted accounting principles. The league argued
credit unions are different from other financial institutions in these
respects and warrant specialized examiners.
        California credit unions have made a substantial investment in
training and computers for the DoC credit union staff. Through the use of
operating and deposit insurance funds many millions of dollars have been
spent educating California's examiners and other officials. Therefore, the
league said, this investment would be lost if new training devices were
needed.
        CCUL also said CUs should have separate regulatory and supervisory
policies because the league and credit unions have invested substantial
resources in adopting laws and regulations that govern operations.
        The league also wants assurance that consolidation results in
reduced operating and examination fees for credit unions because they pay
for the operation of the DoC. The league also argued state credit unions
pay substantially more in operating and examination fees than their federal
counterparts.
        A consolidated regulator would have to sustain a positive
relationship with NCUA, the league said. Common examination platforms,
shared computer technology and other cooperative arrangements minimize
regulatory burdens for all parties, it argued. But the regulator would also
have to protect state authority from federal encroachment, CCUL said.
        In addition, CCUL's legislative agenda to recodify the credit union
law and seek franchise and sales tax relief would have to be maintained as
well.
        Duerr said the tax issues in California and the potential change in
the regulatory environment make the climate for state-chartered credit
unions in that state inhospitable. He said it's also important to note that
a gray area exists as each state's regulatory framework varies somewhat.
        In July 1995, a proposal was passed and signed into law by Gov.
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin that created a new department consisting of
several divisions, mirroring what is already law in 44 states. According to
the Wisconsin League, as a result of legislative compromise, credit unions
will be one of the divisions attached to this new department for
administrative purposes, while retaining its autonomy as a separate entity
called the Department of Credit Unions.
        The change is positive for Wisconsin credit unions because they
will gain administrative and legal assistance they lacked as a separate
entity.
        Gary Gores, president of the Ohio League, said his league grappled
with a consolidation bill last year. He said a bill was approved at year-
end 1995 that included a compromise with the governor's office. The league
was able to get the Ohio government to agree to have a person on staff that
would head up credit unions.
        Gores said the league wanted to make sure credit unions wouldn't be
unduly influenced by banking and thrift regulators. "In the long run it
won't hurt us. But in the short run it will be an adjustment," he said.

DODGING THE LOAN ASSASSIN
Appeals Court Rules CU Student Loans Nondismissible

Members who owe student loans to federal credit unions can't use
bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying off the debt, a federal appeals court
has ruled.
        The 1st U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in December is significant
because for the first time, a court said that federal credit unions are
"government units" for purposes of having educational loans
nondischargeable.
        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy
proceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofit
organization.
        The ruling stemmed from a case brought by T.I. Federal Credit Union
in Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.
DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case went
before the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definition
of both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for these
loans.
        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.
        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylaws
provided that shareholders get a dividend." Koban won this point in
bankruptcy court.
        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its case
to U.S. district court and it eventually ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.
        The district court defined a CU as a nonprofit because, under U.S.
bankruptcy law Section 523(a)(8), it's a "democratically controlled,
cooperative, nonprofit society organized for the purpose of encouraging
thrift and self-reliance among its members'."
        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the
"government unit" status, so the case was appealed to the 1st Circuit Court
of Appeals. The 1st Circuit said federal credit unions are, in fact,
government units, so it didn't see the need to address whether it was also
a nonprofit.
        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning of
this section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)
offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.
        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments
are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying
as a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,
insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor's
loans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters of
either provision," the 1st Circuit said.
        Koban, reached by NCUA Watch, asked rhetorically whether this
ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank is a
"government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the law
should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period. This
ruling is counter intuitive."
        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn't
address the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress is
the only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, not
the courts.
        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'
educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.
        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.
        According to the brief of the case, T.I. FCU advanced loans as part
of its special educational loan program. This program differs from standard
loan programs in that it allows for lower interest rates, gives borrowers
longer repayment periods and allows loans to be aggregated in maximum
amounts greater than those permitted under personal loan programs. The
program also enables borrowers to simultaneously borrow additional funds
and refinance outstanding balances on previous loans.
        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times for
assistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into a
single promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes
$32,618. His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but his
lawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely.
        Student loan data supplied by the Credit Union National Association
show that for year-end 1994, the latest date available, roughly one-third
of CUs offer just Guaranteed Student Loans (FFEL), one-third offer just
non-guaranteed student loans and a third offer both.
        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage of
credit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.
Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a CU that lends FFELs, and
37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends other types
of student loans. --Ken Reed

LENDERS TO FIGHT RISE IN 1099 PENALTIES

Representatives of the nation's lending industries are joining
together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for what they believe
is a plan to raise the penalties for failing to file, or filing
inaccurately, so-called "information returns," the infamous 1099s.
        These forms are used by lenders to report payments of dividends,
interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely paid, for
example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit, U.S.
government securities or similar instruments.
        The Clinton administration proposal is part of the budget stalemate
that closed the federal government for several weeks, among other
developments.
        The administration submitted a proposal to the Republican
leadership in Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to the Republican calls for
deep cuts in the federal budget that calls for increases in miscellaneous
fees and closing of certain loopholes.
        The proposal, aimed more at stirring indigination from those
affected than a plan with even a small chance of winning congressional
support, included several other provisions that the administration knew
would be opposed by powerful corporate interests. For example, it calls for
requiring federal banking regulators to impose examination fees on state-
chartered banks.
        The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments for
services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC.
        However, according to a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert
Rubin dated Jan. 2, the lenders said that an explanation provided by the
Joint Committee on Taxation Dec. 15 indicated the provision had a much
broader scope.

CU AUDITING FIRM ACQUIRED BY INSURANCE CO.

A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurance
company--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into the
insurance business.
        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British West
Indies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International Standards
Group Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory audits
for more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.
        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into the
insurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in a
recent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit union
services.
        A source within the industry told NCUA Watch that ISG is attempting
to expand into insurance because it's not making any money from supervisory
committee audits.
        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.
        ISG is the parent company of Financial Standards Group, Boca Raton,
Fla., and the only publicly owned auditing firm in the United States.

FANNIE SET TO BOOST LOAN LIMIT TO $207,000

Fannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conforming
loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to
$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industry
sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers to
raise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect
Jan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider the
views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make its
announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said those
details would be made available shortly.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not return
requests for comments.
        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie
raised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the last
month, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the
change in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew
that to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to
Freddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be
surprised."
