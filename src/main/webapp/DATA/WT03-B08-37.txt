DEC 28, 1995, METALS WEEK

US secondary aluminum producer Alreco Metals owes $56,495.32 of accrued
vacation pay to terminated employees, not $56.5-mil as stated in the Dec 28
edition of Platt's Metals Week. The other debt figures listed were correct
according to bankruptcy filings.

BRAZIL TO SEE FOUR MORE CAN PLANTS

American National Can Co has announced plans to open four more factories in
Brazil by 2000, even before completing its first factory in Extrema, Minas
Gerais. ANC plans to invest $310-mil in the four units. Each factory will
have a 1.5-bil unit/year capacity on its first two production lines and an
additional 800-mil to 900-mil cans with the installation of a third
production line.

Intalco buys more power: Intalco Aluminum Corp of Ferndale, Wash., said it

Intalco buys more power: Intalco Aluminum Corp of Ferndale, Wash., said it
has agreed to buy 770 GWh of energy and up to 145 MW of capacity per year
for five years from Powerex, the export arm of BC Hydro of Vancouver, to
diversify its power supply from the Bonneville Power Administration. The
deal went into effect Nov 22 and will continue through Sep 30, 2000, with
the power moving over BPA lines. Intalco has a 460 MW load when at full
production. It signed a new five-year power supply contract with BPA this
fall which goes into effect Apr 1 for 360MW for 12 months a year. From Apr
15-Jul 15, BPA is selling Intalco 450 MW. BPA already had given its
directly served industrials permission to buy a portion of their power
starting Oct 1, 1995 from other suppliers. The price for power was not
disclosed, but Powerex said it is competitive with current markets and
BPA's price of 2.26 cents/kWh.

KRASNOYARSK FACING LOSSES

The Krasnoyarsk Metallurgical Plant (KraMZ), one of Russia's biggest
processed aluminum producers, could post year-end losses of around
Rb100-bil ($215-mil), a senior company official told the Interfax news
agency. KraMZ financial manager Alexander Bocharov said output in October
and November was down by half on the previous year, resulting in losses of
Rb42-bil by the start of December. The downturn had been caused mainly by
an imbalance between domestic and world prices for primary aluminum,
Bocharov said. Costs inside Russia had soared to $2,500/mt against
$1,600/mt for the London quoted price because of rising electricity, rail
and other charges, he said. In 1994, KraMZ produced 67,660mt of aluminum
ingots and 21,570mt of rolled aluminum products, of which 23.4% and 33.1%
respectively were exported.

INDIAN AL EXPORTS UP, EARNINGS DOWN...

India's aluminum exports will rise to about 105,000mt in the current fiscal
year ending in March 1996, from 91,000mt in the previous fiscal year, but
earnings are unlikely to rise because of a fall in international prices,
according to Chemicals and Allied Products Export Promotion Council
executive director D Kar. Kar said exports in the previous 1994-95 were
valued at Rupees 3.87-bil (about $112.2-mil), but this fiscal year's
increased export volume is only expected to earn Rupees 3.9-bil. Although
the aluminum industry is keen to expand its existing capacity on optimistic
views of the future, an uncertain electricity supply and volatile aluminum
prices on the LME have defied financial projections. Indian Aluminium Co,
which had been slowly putting its Belgaum smelter in Karnataka back into
production, has again run into acute power cuts, Kar said. A recent
decision by National Aluminium Co to stop all sales because of its problems
with excise authorities will also affect India's exports, he said.

 ...ALUMINUM OUTPUT RISING

Kar also said that India's aluminum industry stood a good chance of earning
more from alumina exports in the current fiscal year. This year's alumina
exports will total about 500,000mt, flat from the previous fiscal year, but
earnings might jump to Rupees 3-bil, from Rupees 2.3-bil a year before
because of this year's soaring prices. Meanwhile, India's aluminum metal
output during November 1995 was 41,362mt, below the official target of
43,583mt, according to the latest data from the federal mines ministry. The
total output from April to November in the current fiscal year was
340,480mt, compared with 308,644mt for the corresponding year-earlier
period. State-owned National Aluminium Co Ltd reported April-November 1995
output of 123,480mt, up from year-earlier levels of 112,026mt. Bharat
Aluminium Co Ltd, another state-run company, reported April-November 1995
output at 61,194mt, up from 60,678mt for the same 1994 period. The two
private-sector producers--Hindalco and Indian Aluminium Co Ltd--also
reported higher output. Hindalco's April-November 1995 output was 112,924mt
compared with 106,684mt for the corresponding period last year, while Indal
reported a sharp increase to 42,814mt from 29,256mt.

JAPAN'S ALUMINUM IMPORTS DECLINE

Japan's customs-cleared unwrought aluminum imports reached 202,878mt in
November, down from 220,680mt in October, and down from 247,622mt in
November 1994, the Ministry of Finance announced. Slow domestic demand, as
well as seasonal factors, reduced the imports, one trader said. Of the
total, imports of standard aluminum (Al max. 99.9%) reached 143,185mt in
November, up from 141,881mt in October, but down from 179,896mt in November
1994. High-grade aluminum imports were 10,085mt in November, down from
16,185mt in October, but up from 8,645mt in November 1994. Imports of
unwrought aluminum alloy were 49,608mt in November, down from 62,614mt in
October, and down from 59,081mt in November 1994, MOF said.

ORMET CLOSE TO POWER DEAL

Ohio Power is ``making some pretty good progress'' in negotiating a power
supply contract extension with Ormet's Hannibal, Ohio, aluminum complex and
is expected to sign an agreement soon, according to Henry Fayne, controller
for American Electric Power, Ohio Power's parent company. Ohio Power's
30-year contract to supply 536MW of electricity to the 255,000mt/year
primary aluminum smelter at Hannibal is scheduled to expire in March 1997.
Earlier this year, Ormet issued a request for proposals to find a long-term
replacement for Ohio Power, saying it was shopping around for less
expensive power. The two companies are believed to be close to an agreement
to extend the 1997 contract by an additional two or three years. Fayne
declined to comment on whether the extension will include rate concessions.
He told Platt's his company also is working with Ormet on a second front.
``We're trying to see how a third-party supply agreement would work,'' he
said.

HC FECR PRICES SOFTER AGAIN

In a generally quiet week for the US bulk alloys markets, high-carbon
ferrochrome prices weakened further on the news that a US consumer had
bought a bargeload of material at a price below 62 cents/lb. The Platt's
Metals Week dealer price was lowered to 62-65 cents/lb, as the sale in
question also included a prompt payment discount. Elsewhere, prices were
generally static, with low-carbon ferrochrome prices continuing to hold up
relatively well; 0.15% C material reportedly changed hands at prices around
$1.10/lb FOB.

JAPAN BUYS TRANSALLOYS SIMN AT $750/MT

Japanese traders have contracted to buy a total of 1,750mt of
silicomanganese from South Africa's Transalloys at $750/mt CIF Japan, up
from the current $650/mt, provided the shipments are made in time to meet
Japan's GSP duty free customs-clearance deadline, traders said. ``Since the
1996 [GSP] applications will start Apr 1, the cargo must be ready at a
Japanese port by the end of March,'' said one trader. If they fail to meet
the deadline, buyers would have to pay a 3% duty, or $22.50/mt, on top of
the agreed price. Transalloys apparently offered 3,000-4,000mt of the
metal, but only succeeded in finding buyers for 1,750mt. ``Prices of
$750/mt are still too high for us, duty unpaid or not,'' said one consumer.
Meanwhile, Samancor has yet to settle its Q1 price talks with Japanese
buyers; the company is also looking for a $100 price hike to $750/mt.

4,950mt, down 3.9% from 5,149mt for the same period in 1994. Of the total,
imports from Zaire rose 20.8% to 1,220mt from 1,010mt. Imports from Canada
also increased 20.2%, to 876mt from 729mt. However, eleven-month imports
from Zambia fell 37.7% to 712mt from 1,143mt for the same 1994 period.

Japan nickel imports fall: Japan's customs-cleared unalloyed unwrought
nickel imports reached 4,798mt in November, down from 5,501mt in October,
and down from 5,187mt in November 1994, the Ministry of Finance announced.
Imports from Russia reached 1,666mt in November, down sharply from 2,388mt
the previous month, but up from 1,088mt a year earlier. Imports totaled
57,837mt for the January-November period, up from 42,637mt for the first
eleven months of 1994. Imports from Russia jumped to 21,675mt from 9,205mt.
Meanwhile, Japan's customs-cleared ferronickel imports reached 3,214mt in
November, down from 5,911mt from November 1994. January-November imports
totaled 60,029mt, up from 46,562mt for the same 1994 period.

COBALT TO STAY AROUND $30/LB NEAR TERM--DRI

DRI-McGraw-Hill has revised upward its projection for 1996 cobalt prices to
some extent, but remains bearish for the longer term. While DRI states that
markets now appear to remain in deficit through most of 1996, for the
longer term, it expects African production will rebound. New production
from a number of sources will impact the markets slowly, in all likelihood
not until 1998, with the strongest effect in 1999. ``This additional
material will close the gap between production and consumption and could
throw markets into a surplus,'' DRI said, adding: ``As a result of the new
supplies, prices are now forecast to fall across 1998 and 1999.''

CODELCO SERVES WRIT ON SOGEMIN METALS

(London, Santiago)
Chilean state-owned copper-molybdenum producer Codelco has launched its
first formal overseas legal action in response to the company's 1994
futures trading losses. London-based lawyers Herbert Smith, acting on
behalf of Codelco, confirmed Friday that a writ was served on LME
ring-dealer Sogemin Metals Ltd on Dec 21, alleging conspiracy to defraud
the Chilean company. Both Sogemin Metals Ltd and US subsidiary Sogemin
Metals Inc--which acted as introducing broker--are named in the action,
together with two Chilean companies who acted as Sogemin agents in Chile,
and individuals dealing with former Codelco trader Juan Pablo Davila. No
specific financial claim is made in the writ.
Codelco's losses in the 1994 copper futures trading debacle are estimated
at $174-mil, and the claim is expected to cover ``a significant part of
Codelco's losses'', according to Tim Parkes, partner at Herbert Smith.
   He said he expected further legal proceedings to be instigated by
Codelco against other trading companies in both London and New York as the
investigation into the losses continues, but could not give a timescale for
these actions. Sogemin, a subsidiary of Belgium's Union Miniere, now has 14
days from the serving of the writ to decide whether it will defend the
action, and a further two-to-three weeks to lodge a defense.
   Sources close to the company said the matter is now in the hands of its
lawyers. Sogemin chairman Michel Moser could not be reached for comment.
   Judge Jose Benquis, who is conducting the international investigations
into Codelco's losses, said earlier in the week that the next order of
business will be a summons to testify issued to Juan Marcelo Avendano,
Davila's brother-in-law and a Sogemin employee. Benquis said Avendano is
not currently living in Chile, and that his whereabouts are still unknown.
   Also under investigation, said Benquis, is whether Davila's sizable
private accounts in Caribbean banks, valued at over $1-mil, are linked to
the Sogemin payments. Davila has thus far failed to satisfactorily explain
the origin of the funds, charged Benquis: ``In fact, the situation, in my
opinion, has worsened.''
   Meanwhile, Chilean Deputy Luis Valentin Ferrada, of the Renovation
Nacional party and a member of the Congressional investigating committee,
said Codelco's case against Sogemin only confirms the commission's original
contention that Davila could not have acted without the collusion of
brokers and intermediaries. Ferrada is calling for a beefed-up
investigation in the US, where Codelco suffered losses in gold and silver
speculation.
   On Dec 26, when the presidentially appointed joint State Defense
Council-Codelco commission investigating Codelco's losses announced at a
press conference in Santiago that a suit had been filed against Sogemin,
Council president Luis Bates said that the commission must act
``cautiously'' and ``with reserve'' in disclosing details in the case to
comply with confidentiality restrictions mandated by foreign courts. ``It
is not our intention to be close-mouthed. Reserve and caution are demanded
by foreign legislation, namely US and British, that prevents us from
providing more information and jeopardizing progress in the case,'' said
Bates. While internal investigations abroad are ``very advanced, we must
proceed at a different pace at the level of coordinated international
inquiries,'' he added.
   Codelco CEO Juan Villarzu, who was also present at the conference,
conceded that Codelco will have to abandon hope of recovering the lion's
share of financial losses, as they were incurred by financial
``mismanagement'' at the hands of one of its own employees. Nevertheless
Codelco aims to recover some of the loss by exacting damage payments from
third parties involved. ``Our goal is to learn the truth, punish those
responsible, and to recover costs for Codelco and the country,'' said
Villarzu.
   The commission, headed by Bates, launched its investigation abroad in
December 1994 to determine whether foreign operators were linked to
Codelco's 1993 futures trading losses. Until now only Davila had been
formally charged.

ZALDIVAR PREPARES FOR EXPANDED PRODUCTION

(Santiago)
While other mining companies scour the Chilean Andes hoping to find their
own Escondida, Compania Minera Zaldivar has gone into production with a
somewhat more modest deposit located in the same neighborhood.
   Owned in equal parts by Outokumpu and Placer Dome, Zaldivar produced
its first copper cathode in June 1995 and estimates total 1995 production
at 23,000mt. The plan is to boost production to 85,000mt in 1996, and hit
full capacity of 125,000mt/year in 1997.
   Zaldivar has been blessed with a deposit that allows it to get into
production with very little capital cost. Before moving on to the main zone
it will first extract the primarily oxide ore that lies almost exposed at
the surface of the Pinta Verde zone. Although this segment, with an average
of 0.75%, is lower-grade ore than the 0.86% main zone, it has a low
stripping ratio making for quick cheap extraction with little waste.
   ``From a cash flow point of view, it is ideal to develop this type of
mine,'' said Tapani Jarvinen, Zaldivar's general manager.
   A short leaching cycle for the oxides from the Pinta Verde section was
an added bonus that could not be ignored when Zaldivar engineers designed
the production schedule. The Pinta Verde oxide leach cycle is about 150
days. For comparison, Quebrada Blanca, controlled by Cominco Ltd and Teck
Corp, has a leach cycle of 210 days.
   Zaldivar will be ready to begin working the high-grade main segment of
its deposit by the middle of 1996. While Zaldivar's reserves of 316-mil mt
grading 1.14% don't compare to Escondida's 1.8-bil mt or Collahuasi's
3.1-bil mt, it is still a hefty deposit.
   Jarvinen said Zaldivar uses standard heap leaching technology with the
addition of some novelties like water flushing in the tertiary crushing
process. Even though the mine is located at a high enough altitude to
warrant special precaution for humans, who lose 20-30% of their cognitive
ability, and specially designed diesel engines, the bacteria, it seems,
don't suffer from the effects of the altitude.
   Zaldivar has the largest solvent extraction and electrowinning complex
in the world built in one stage on an undeveloped site. It is also the
first large-scale use of Outokumpu's Vertical Smooth Flow technology, first
used at a cobalt/nickel plant in Finland in 1991. The system has been
tested on a pilot plant scale at Codelco's Chuquicamata since 1992, and
will produce 90% recovery from pregnant leach solution.
   The first productive phase--called ``Stage 0''--consists of extracting
the oxides, which have some secondary sulfides mixed in, in order to feed
the SX-EW operation. While this is happening, stripping will begin in the
main zone. When the oxides are depleted, extraction will start at the Stage
1 pit while the Stage 2 pit is being stripped and so on. Seventeen years
later, Zaldivar expects to be finishing up on Stage 5.
   The acid leaching will use about 200,000mt of sulfuric acid annually,
and slightly more at the beginning. Like most new mines that see their
productive lives extending into the 21st century, Zaldivar uses a
Geopositioning Satellite realtime dispatch system, allowing one central
office to monitor all equipment movements and optimize their use.
   Zaldivar and Escondida have decided to make the best of their physical
proximity, turning the lack of elbow room into an advantage for both of
them, particularly Zaldivar. The ``synergy factor,'' as Jarvinen calls it,
consists of cooperative infrastructure development, property leasing, and
some old-fashioned gentlemen's agreements. The two jointly built a 170km
access road connecting both sites to the Pan American Highway junction
outside Antofagasta. The double circuit 220 kilovolt transmission line that
runs from the Zaldivar SX-EW plant substation to the El Crucero substation
was also a joint venture and serves both mines.
   Zaldivar has signed an agreement with Escondida, giving it rights to
incur on Escondida property when digging some of its pits, to obtain the
required slope grade. Zaldivar's processing plant is even located on
Escondida property, through a special leasing agreement.
   Zaldivar pumps process water from Negrillar, 100km to the east. In the
case of a hypothetical future water shortage by either mine, Zaldivar
considers that the good neighbor policy it has sustained thus far with
Escondida, which has rights to a closer well, would lead the two companies
to draw up an agreement for water sharing.

WARBURG SAYS COPPER HAS PEAKED

Illustration(s):
Illustration: Graph: Newly released research from S.G Warburg estimates
that copper's $1.325/lb price in the second half of 1995 is as high as it
will go for the next three years. Their research shows a steady decline
right on through the second half of 1998 when the price will be 80
cents/lb. Basic to this price is the easing concentrate markets, increasing
production of refined copper, and a falling rate of consumption growth.

JAPAN TI SPONGE EXPORTS UP...

Japan's customs-cleared titanium sponge exports reached 574mt in November,
up 47.2% from 390mt in October and up 38% from 416mt in November 1994, the
Ministry of Finance reported. Exports to the US rose to 345mt, up 72.5%
from October's 200mt and 205% from 113mt a year ago. The November mean
export price to the US averaged Yen 825/kg ($3.68/lb) FOB in November, up
from Yen 722/kg ($3.25/lb) the previous month, and up from Yen 706/kg
($3.28/lb) a year earlier, MOF said. Japan's titanium sponge exports to the
European Union totaled 228mt in November, up 20% from 190mt in October, but
down 24.8% from 303mt in November 1994. Meanwhile, Japan's titanium sponge
exports during January-November reached 4,790mt, up 18.5% from 4,042mt for
the same period a year earlier. Exports to the US rose 30.4% to 1,490mt
from 1,143mt, and those to the EU increased to 3,136mt, up 8.7% from
2,884mt, MOF said.

Japan's exports of titanium mill products reached 297mt in November, down
from 436mt in October, and down from 343mt in November 1994, MOF said. Of
the total, exports to the European Union reached 198mt, down from 253mt a
month earlier, but up from 74mt a year earlier. November exports to South
Korea and the United States also dropped, while those to Taiwan increased a
little, MOF said. Meanwhile mill product exports for the January-November
period edged lower to 4,159mt, from 4,234 for the first eleven months of
1994.

Indonesian tin producer PT Tambang Timah expects an increase in its tin

(Hong Kong)
Indonesian tin producer PT Tambang Timah expects an increase in its tin
production next year, given strong market fundamentals and expectations of
firmer prices, President Director Erry Riyana Hardjapamekas said last
week.
   ``We expect world tin prices to firm with both a reasonable
international economic outlook and stronger tin market fundamentals,''
Hardjapamekas said, describing the year of 1996 as ``a good year for tin
prices.'' He said that Timah is planning to raise its tin metal production
by 18.3% in 1996 from 1995's planned production.
   Timah now has an installed tin production capacity of 42,400mt/year at
its Mentok smelter, with planned production in 1995 of about 37,000mt. All
the tin concentrates produced by the country's two producers, Timah and
Koba, are smelted at the Mentok smelter. Hardjapamekas also said that Timah
is now planning to add another furnace next year at the Mentok smelter to
boost production.
   At the end of 1994, Timah added its sixth furnace at Mentok to increase
production capacity from 33,500mt/year to the current 42,400mt/year. He
said Timah's tin production and exports are forecast to rise over the next
few years, anticipating a demand growth worldwide, helped by a current
shift in demand to less-costly metals. ``Timah is still strongly focused on
reducing its own cost of production and we intend to consolidate our
position as the lowest-cost producer in the world over the next few
years,'' he said.
   For 1996, Indonesia is expected to export 40,000-45,000mt of tin, up
from an estimated 34,000mt of exports in 1995, a government official said
earlier.

ZINC PRODUCTION DOWN IN NOVEMBER--EZI

Total primary zinc production fell to 452,100mt in November from 458,600mt
in October, the European Zinc Institute said last week. European production
fell to 179,900mt from 180,200mt, while outside Europe, production fell to
272,200mt from 278,400mt.Year-on-year figures show total production fell
from 455,000mt in November 1994. Outside Europe, year-on-year production
fell from 279,900mt, but within Europe, it rose from 175,100mt. Total
producer stocks were 323,300mt, down from 341,500mt in October but up from
315,200mt in November 1994. European stocks were 110,400mt, down from
122,200mt in October and 131,200mt a year earlier. The EZI announced its
statistical deprtment at Obertshausen in Germany will shut down Jan 1. The
EZI said it had decided to close the department and to stop all statistical
reports. It gave no reason for the decision.

JAPAN ZINC OUTPUT DOWN, SALES UP

Japan's zinc production reached 52,779mt in November, down 9% from October,
and down 11.3% from November 1994, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry announced last week. Shipments reached 53,058mt, up 2.9% from the
previous month, but down 9.7% from year-earlier levels. Inventories at the
end of November fell to 78,744mt, down 5.7% from end-October, and down
11.4% from a year earlier, MITI said. With Mitsubishi Materials gradually
winding down output at its Akita smelter in preparation for the plant's
eventual shutdown next June, Japan's zinc supplies are getting tight, one
trader source said. The Ministry of Finance announced last week that
Japan's zinc imports reached 6,604mt in November, up 23.6% from 5,341mt in
October, and up 100% from 3,300mt in November 1994. January-November zinc
imports reached 107,983mt, up 81% from 59,766mt for the same period in
1994.

METALEUROP SEES IMPROVED TURNOVER

Franco-German lead-zinc producer Metaleurop posted a loss of FFr122-mil for
the financial year ending Sep 30, 1995. However, consolidated turnover for
the group saw a 16% increase on year-earlier levels at FFr4.133-bil, thanks
to higher metals production and--particularly in the case of lead--higher
metals prices. Parent company Metaleurop SA showed a net profit for the
year of FFr200,000. Over the year, Metaeurop invested FFr354-mil--twice as
much as in the previous year--mainly at its zinc refinery in
Noyelles-Godault, the new lead plant in Nordenham and the smelting reactor
in Oker. In the current business year, Metaleurop said it will focus on
cost-cutting and productivity programs. The new lead smelter at Nordenham
will start up in spring 1996, with production costs nearly 20% below the
cost of the old plant which was closed at the end of November.

ECONOMIC GROWTH TO CONTINUE IN 1996 WITH LOW INFLATION

(New York)
For much of 1996, economic growth in the US, Japan, and much of Europe will
largely maintain its current pace, with no major surprises expected. The
dollar will decline slightly against some currencies, the inflation rate
will move higher, and both short-and long-term interest rates will continue
trending lower.
   This is the prognosis of many economists despite the current
less-than-rosy economic picture. Economic growth has slowed in recent
months, with the index of leading US indicators--the barometer of economic
growth about nine months ahead--slumping 0.5% in October, the steepest drop
in six months. October's fall followed a 0.1% decline in September. In
other bad economic news, the unemployment rate rose to 5.6% in November
from 5.5% in October, new home sales fell 2.7% in October from September,
and 10-month sales were running at 2% below 1994 levels.
   But these declines tempered by a surge in spending for new construction,
which the Commerce Dept said rose 2.7% in October, the second consecutive
monthly increase and the largest in more than three years.
   According to Anirvan Banerji, economist with the International Business
Cycle department at Columbia University in New York, the leading indicators
point to a continuation of relatively slow growth through the first half of
1996 for the current US economic expansion, which began in March 1994. He
noted that the slow growth stems from a backlog of inventories due to weak
retail sales. Inventories are ``having a drag on production,'' he noted.
   ``Once the inventory correction is over, there will be a slight pickup
in the economy some time in the first half, but it will be not robust,''
Banerji said. Beyond the second quarter, his crystal ball becomes blurred.
He does not rule out a mild recession, but notes: ``For the second half of
1996, the indicators are not yet giving us a clear signal.''
   The Conference Board's chief economist Gail Fosler is more optimistic.
She said that with long-term interest rates remaining low, economic growth
will be much stronger during the first half of 1996 than it was in the
first half of 1995. ``By heightening financial market expectations and
pushing long-term interest rates lower than economic fundamentals warrant,
the Fed has unwittingly set the stage for the next phase of the
expansion,'' she said.
   Fosler noted that the budget now under debate in Washington will more
likely help US economic growth than hurt it, because about one-third of the
$90-bil in proposed spending cuts in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 shifts
program responsibility to the states and may not ``materially affect total
government activity.'' The remaining two-thirds represent Medicaid and
Medicare reform. The economic effect of these reductions will be very
different from defense cuts in the 1980s, she claims, since they represent
decelerations in spending growth, not outright reductions.
   ``This will still leave the growth in federal health care spending at
twice the rate of growth in business spending or non government health care
costs,'' Fosler said. She added that the accompanying tax cuts will boost
consumer income as well and further stimulate the economy.
   Charles Schultz, an economist at the Brookings Institution, also
believes the economic expansion will continue. ``I don't see any great
dangers of a recession in 1996, but I think it [growth] will be a bit
soft,'' he said.
   Similar views were expressed by Cynthia Latta, senior financial
economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill. ``GDP growth will depend on what happens in
the budget talks,'' she said. But she noted that GDP will increase by
2-2.5% in 1996. Third-quarter GDP growth was unchanged from the Q2 level at
3%. She does not anticipate a decline in the economy and noted: ``I think
the Federal Reserve has made anticipatory moves, to a greater degree than
it did in the past, and preempted a downward move in the economy.''

Low interest rates
   Economic growth in 1996 will get a further boost from low interest
rates. The Fed recently lowered its Federal Funds Rate by 0.25% to 5.5%,
its first reduction since July. Most observers believe the Fed might be
willing to make further cuts to nudge the economy along, once there is an
agreement on the budget.
   But interest rates must eventually rise with any boost in economic
growth. While higher interest rates may be delayed by ``excessive
optimism'' about this year's budget package, the longer this ``necessary
adjustment'' takes, the higher interest rates will ultimately rise, the
Conference Board's Fosler said.
   The Brookings Institution's Schultz noted that the budget outcome will
play a key role in determining future economic growth and also the level of
interest rates. ``If there is some compromise, I would expect interest
rates to remain in the same general area where they are now. I don't seen
any particular reason why they should move up or down significantly from
where they are,'' he said. Schultz added: ``The likelihood is that any
changes over the short term will be down rather than up.''
   However, further economic growth will accelerate the increase in the
inflation rate, according to Fosler. ``The Federal Reserve Board's recent
success in curbing inflation may prove to be its own undoing,'' she said.
And although inflation is currently running at a rate of 2-3%, it is more
likely to rise than decline, even though prices of consumer goods are still
rising at a 2% annual rate at the producer level and discounting appears to
have ended at the retail level. Fosler noted that prices respond quickly to
changes in demand and, therefore, a reacceleration in consumer demand will
raise prices.

Inflation under control
   According to Schultz, inflation ``has been behaving very well and is not
getting out of hand.'' He added: ``I don't see any pressure being built up
in the economy.'' He noted that raw materials prices and wages remain
subdued. DRI's Latta agrees, saying: ``I would not expect inflation to come
in at over 3% next year. We could get a spike up in food and energy prices,
but I would not expect the CPI core rate to go above 3%.'' The November CPI
remained unchanged at 0.1%.
   Further evidence that the US will not face any serious economic shocks
in 1996 are the states of affairs in Japan and Europe, where economic
growth remains anemic at best. One economist described Japan as ``a basket
case,'' but Latta said: ``I think the Japanese economy will remain fairly
weak but will slowly come out of its slump, because the government is
beginning to handle the banking problem.''
   Economic problems facing the major US trading partners will help keep
the dollar from skidding against the major foreign currencies. David
Abramson of the Bank Credit Analyst believes the dollar will ``go higher
because the European economy is weaker than the US economy,'' adding: ``We
are not going to be too worried about the dollar until we see signs that
the US economy is strengthening.''
   Based on the assumption that Japan keeps interest rates low and expands
bank reserves to keep its stock market strong, Abramson forecasts the yen
at Yen 108 to the dollar for much of 1996. Latta pegged it at Yen 100-105.
As for the Deutschmark, Abramson said, ``Europe needs to do more to turn
its economy around, and the pressure on the German economy will keep its
currency at about DM1.55 to the dollar.''

CHINA FACING 1-MIL MT ALUMINA DEFICIT IN 1996

(Hong Kong)
China is likely to have a 1-mil mt deficit in the domestic alumina market
in 1996 despite a projected 9% increase in output from 1995 levels, Chinese
alumina and aluminum producers said. The main hope of redeucing the deficit
would be restricted output from aluminum smelters as a result of power
shortages, they added.
   China's alumina output is expected to rise to 2.5-mil mt in 1996, from
an estimated 2.3-mil mt in 1995, according to alumina producers. The
deficit in the alumina market will have to be covered by imports, they
said. And a 6% import duty cut in January may force alumina producers to
lower prices to the domestic market and to long-term contractors, or
aluminum smelters will boost alumina imports, they noted.
   Major alumina producers offer at Yuan 3,230/mt ($389) to the domestic
market and Yuan 2,999.88/mt ($361) to long-term contractors. But the rise
in alumina output in 1996 is not expected to keep pace with strong aluminum
demand. With an easing in the tight power supply situation, aluminum output
is projected to rise to 1.7-mil to 1.8-mil mt from an estimated 1.65-mil mt
in 1995, aluminum producers said.
   Many aluminum smelters, particularly those located in northwestern and
southwestern provinces, hope to be able to operate at full capacity in 1996
after power shortages in 1995 forced production cuts, the sources said.
Their heightened output is likely to marginally cover the moderate growth
of domestic consumption, they said.
   The producers' plans for 1996 hinge on electricity supply. As a result
of rapid economic growth for the past decade and slow growth of electricity
generating capacity, electricity supply is insufficient to meet demand in
many Chinese provinces.
   Most of the aluminum smelters in China's northwestern Gansu province
have failed to operate at full capacity in 1995, with insufficient
electricity in the area forcing these smelters to cut 10-30% of production
throughout the year, a local official said. Total aluminum production
capacity in Gansu is estimated at 300,000mt/year, the official said, and
may be achieved in 1996 as the electricity supply is likely to increase. In
Qinghai province, adjacent to Gansu, inadequate electricity supplies
limited Qinghai Aluminum Smelter's production to only 110,000mt in 1995
compared with its capacity of 200,000mt/year, a company source said.
Although Qinghai Smelter is hoping to boost its production in 1996, the
necessary increase in power availability is still uncertain, he said:
``Local authorities have been unable to promise a supply rise.''
   Meanwhile, in China's southwestern Guizhou province, an electricity
shortage forced the 190,000mt/year Guizhou Aluminum Smelter to cut 1995
output to 150,000mt, a smelter source said. ``We were able to produce
enough alumina to support our full aluminum capacity production, but no
electricity,'' said the source. Guizhou Aluminum is planning to run at full
capacity in 1996 despite uncertain electricity supply, the source added.
   Alumina producers will try to keep up with the increased aluminum
output. In 1996, China Great Wall Aluminum Corp, China's largest alumina
producer, plans to run at full capacity of 800,000mt/year after failing to
reach its target capacity in 1995 because of continual technical problems,
a company source said.
   Shanxi Aluminum Smelter, China's second-largest producer, also plans to
operate at its full capacity of 800,000mt/year in 1996, with hopes that the
firm will fully utilize its new facilities after completing a capacity
expansion earlier this year, a company source said. Shanxi Aluminum is
expected to produce about 700,000-720,000mt of alumina in 1995, the source
added.
   Meanwhile, Shandong Aluminum Corp and Guizhou Aluminum Smelter will also
lift their alumina production to 540,000mt and 310,000mt, respectively,
company sources said. But production at Guizhou will also depend on the
power supply in the province. 1995 production totaled around 470,000mt for
Shandong and 300,000mt for Guizhou, company sources said.

PLENTY HAPPENED IN THE WORLD OF METALS

Having started production in October this year, Pingguo Aluminum will be
able to produce only 40,000-45,000mt of alumina in 1995, but the firm is
hoping to boost its alumina output to 100,000-150,000mt in 1996 to cover
its aluminum production demand, a company source said.

RHODIUM PRICES PLUNGE TO 22-YEAR LOWS

(New York)
Much to the dismay of dealers and producers alike, rhodium prices have
continued to decline, plunging to a low of $256/oz early last week before
bouncing back slightly by week's end. Prices are currently at their lowest
levels since 1973.
   The rebound came when a European buyer, believed to represent a Swiss
banker, sought to take advantage of the low prices by placing several buy
orders. Even though the total purchase was about 50kg, the price shot up
into the $270-$290 range. ``The buying seems to emanate from a Swiss
bank,'' one London dealer noted. ``The metal was readily available at $245
to $250 yesterday [Dec 28], and this guy came in this morning and took out
some cheap metal and that pushed the price up.''
   The market has been at a virtual standstill in recent weeks, and one
trader noted that last week's burst of activity was the first real buying
since October, when Johnson Matthey was believed to have been a major
player. ``I won't be surprised if it [the price] goes to $200,'' one trader
said.
   One London dealer noted that ``there's plenty of metal around,'' adding:
``Consumers are still working off their stocks, and there's no additional
demand to soak up the metal that is available.'' He said the increased
supplies have been coming from recyclers while mine supplies have been
holding steady.
   The state of the market has confused most analysts, who believed that
consumers would be attracted by the relatively low prices of the metal and
take the opportunity to build their inventories. But so far that has not
happened.
   One analyst explained that the major auto manufacturers, who are the
largest end users of rhodium, already have their cupboards full.
``Consumers are locked in with long-term contracts from the producers and
there is not enough additional demand to soak up the supplies,'' he said.
   Another analyst noted that when rhodium prices hit $7,000/oz in 1990,
auto manufacturers began making improvements in both their engine designs
and catalyst technology with the aim of reducing rhodium consumption. ``The
switch away from rhodium is a one-way street, and it has not turned around
once prices began to fall,'' he said.
   In recent years, Ford Motor Co and the major Japanese auto manufacturers
have made big strides in increasing engine efficiency to reduce the need
for heavy loadings in catalytic converters. For many car models,
palladium-based catalysts can do the job of meeting antipollution
standards, because of cleaner-burning engines.
   Another blow to rhodium is that demand from the European auto market has
not panned out as anticipated, and smaller quantities of the metal are
being used there. On top of that, mine supplies are up and more is on the
way.
   According to Johnson Matthey's Interim Review of the PGM markets,
Zimbabwe's Hartley PGM mine will produce 11,500oz/year of rhodium when the
mine gets up to speed by early 1997. For 1995, rhodium supplies rose to
438,000oz from 426,000oz in 1994, outstripping demand, which rose to
422,000oz in 1994 from 386,000 oz in 1993.
   Producers are in the unenviable position of not being able to curtail
supplies, even though prices are falling. Rhodium is a byproduct of PGM
refining and producers depend on their chief products (platinum and
palladium) to make a profit. Rhodium is frosting on the cake, but in recent
years the layer of frosting has been getting thinner.

US GROUP BUYS MAGMA SHARES

Australian mining giant Broken Hill Proprietary may have to lift its bid
for takeover target Magma Copper after an aggressive New York fund
management group grabbed an 8% stake in the US company, according to an
Australian newspaper report. The Sydney Morning Herald said records filed
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows Gabelli Funds spent
$95.41-mil acquiring shares in Tucson-based Magma after BHP made its
A$3.28-bil ($2.39-bil) takeover bid on Dec 1. The newspaper said most of
the shares were purchased for about $27.80, just short of BHP's $28 per
share cash tender for Magma. BHP made no comment on the move by Gabelli,
but noted its offer has the support of Magma's long-time major shareholder,
investment group Warburg Pincus, which has a 26% stake.

SPCC INVESTING $600-MIL IN ILO SMELTER

Southern Peru Copper Corp is planning to construct a new smelting facility
at its Ilo complex on Peru's southern coast over the next six years at a
cost of $600-mil, a company source told the Santiago daily newspaper El
Mercurio Dec 26. The new plant will use continuous anode casting
technology--an upgrade from the current remelting and refining methods--to
reduce energy consumption and minimize sulfuric acid emissions. The
facility will also include a sulfuric acid plant that will help SPCC keep
emissions within permissible international standards.

PRINCETON MINING GETS OKAY FOR BC MINE

Canada's Princeton Mining has announced that the development of its
Huckleberry copper and molybdenum mine has been approved by the British
Columbia government. Copper production is forecast to average 65-mil
lb/year during the first five years and total 1-bil lb over the life of the
mine. Molybdenum production is expected to average more than 1-mil lb/year.
The mine will cost $137-mil to develop with construction starting in
January and lasting 18 months. A strategic alliance has been formed by
Princeton with a consortium of Japanese companies--Mitsubishi Materials
Corp, Marubeni Corp, Dowa Mining Co, and Furukawa Co--who will take a 40%
stake, senior finance a $60-mil project loan, and buy the mine's total
copper concentrate production.

US SILICON IMPORTERS WIN TEMPORARY ASSURANCE ON DUITES

(Washington)
US importers who brought in silicon metal from Silarsa of Argentina during
the period Sep 1, 1993, through Aug 31, 1994, have received assurance that
their antidumping duty will remain 24.62%, following the completion of a
Commerce Dept administrative review. In addition, the deposit rate for
Silarsa silicon remains 24.62% for future imports, until the completion of
another review, or unless a court appeal causes it to change. Commerce Dept
officials completed the review prior to the US government shutdown.
   Commerce decided to keep the rate unchanged, despite the fact that US
producers American Silicon Technologies, Elkem, Globe, and SKW argued that
the duties should be increased punitively because Silarsa did not cooperate
in this review or a previous one. Silarsa asked to be excused from
responding to Commerce's questionnaire because it exported only 331mt
during the period of review, in October 1993, and it stopped manufacturing
silicon metal in January 1994 and has no near-term plans to resume
production.
   The US companies urged Commerce to increase the rate to the average of
the petition rates, 81.31%, or, at a minimum, to the lowest petition rate
of 49.35%, because they said the current rate is not sufficiently adverse
to induce Silarsa's cooperation.
   Silarsa dismissed the US industry's claim, saying the 24.62% margin
constitutes an insurmountable barrier which precluded it from participating
in the US market and precipitated its decision to cease production. US
trading company Hunter Douglas also submitted comments, arguing that an
increase in the rate would have punished unrelated US importers who must
actually pay the antidumping duties even though they have no control over
foreign exporters or their decisions about whether to cooperate in Commerce
reviews. Commerce agreed with Silarsa that ``there is no evidence to
indicate that, if Silarsa resumes production, the current rate is
insufficient to ensure Silarsa's cooperation in a subsequent review.''
   However, US importers are not in the clear retroactively yet; the US
industry still has several appeals pending before the US courts, and it has
the option of appealing this review as well.

BRAZILIAN MERGER WILL PRODUCE MINING GIANT

(Sao Paulo)
Brazil's Eluma, Caraiba Metais, Paranapanema, and Paraibuna mining groups
were merged Dec 22 into a new company, Companhia Brasiliera de Metais Nao
Ferrosas (CBMNF), after several months of negotiations. A group of
Brazilian pension funds, headed by Bank of Brazil pension fund Previ--which
already controlled Eluma--will pay $300-mil for control of the other
companies. The new company will be set up officially in one month after an
audit performed by the pension companies on Caraiba, Paranapanema, and
Paraibuna.
   CBMNF's shareholders' equity is $900-mil, with yearly sales of $1.1-bil.
The new company has plans to invest $600-mil and increase yearly income to
$1.8-bil. CBMNF will be one of the world's largest tin companies, the only
Brazilian producer of electrolytic copper, and the second-largest
Brazilian producer of zinc. Daniel Birmann, president of the Arbi
Group--which sold its shareholding in Caraiba Metais--commented, ``a large
megacompany was an old idea of the Arbi Group, but we weren't able to
achieve it.''
   The funds will control 98% of the voting capital of Paraibuna, 71% of
Paranapanema, and 66% of Caraiba. Previ's partners in the new company are
Petros (Petrobras' pension fund), Aeros (the Brazilian airline companies'
pension fund), and Sistel (Telebras' pension fund). $30-mil of the $300-mil
price tag was paid on the signing of the protocol. Previ president Jose
Valdir Ribeiro dos Reis said that other groups are interested in buying
into the newly-merged group, though no definite commitment has been made;
potential Brazilian partners include CVRD pension fund Valia, CVRD itself,
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, and BNDES, the national development bank.
   Foreign groups have also expressed an interest, Ribeiro dos Reis said,
citing Australia's BHP plus another unnamed company. ``We have discovered
many synergies among these mining companies in Brazil and we believe that
the new holding will be competitive internationally,'' he added.
   Analyst Roberto Vinhaes of Investidor Profissional noted that ``since
the mining sector has not gone through significant technological
improvements, one of the ways out is to gain economies of scale.'' He added
that, among other advantages for large companies in the mineral sector,
``if the price of tin drops, the company could offset it, for example, by a
rise in the price of copper.''
   Caraiba Metais produces 170,000mt/year of electrolytic copper for the
internal market and exports what it does not sell in Brazil. Paranapanema
owns one of the world's largest tin mines, the 18,000mt/year Pitinga mine
in the Amazon, and also controls the operations of the Bom Futuro reserves
in Rondonia through its Ebesa subsidiary. Pitinga's 1995 output was
expected to reach 11,000mt, up 2,000mt from 1994. Production at Bom Futuro
was projected at 3,500mt for 1995, giving a total of 14,500mt for the
Paranapanema group.
   Zinc producer Paraibuna is currently heavily in debt, and is looking to
invest in hydroelectric energy generation to reduce costs. The company
currently produces 70,000mt/year of primary zinc. Eluma, which produces
copper products and copper/zinc and copper/tin alloys, recently underwent a
restructuring process using technology from Italy's Europa Metalli group.

US COMMERCE DEPT AMENDS INTERLINK MAGNESIUM DUTY ORDER

(Washington)
The US Commerce Dept has amended its final antidumping duty order for
magnesium from Russia to clarify that Interlink has a zero dumping margin
when importing from either of the two Russian producers. The recent
decision answers a complaint stemming from the end of the investigation
earlier this year.
   Commerce published its final determination in the antidumping case on
Mar 30, and the final duty order was published May 12. Interlink alleged on
May 11 that a ministerial error had been made in that Commerce incorrectly
assigned a margin for its sales of magnesium supplied by Russian producer
Solikamsk Magnesium Works. Commerce found the allegation constituted a
ministerial error, but because the US industry had already appealed the
decision to the US Court of International Trade, Commerce was unable to
correct the error and publish the amended final determination.
   Subsequently, the court granted Commerce leave to correct the
ministerial error, which it did in a Dec 20 Federal Register notice, which
was prepared prior to the latest US government shutdown. The notice
clarifies that Interlink has a zero antidumping deposit rate for magnesium
from Avisma and from Solikamsk, but faces 100.25% from any other Russian
producer. Avisma and Solikamsk are the only Russian producers currently in
operation.
   Six other trading companies also have zero duty rates: Gerald Metals,
AIOC, Greenwich Metals, Hochschild Partners, Hunter Douglas, and MG
Metals.

EAGLE MINING POURS FIRST GOLD

Australia's Eagle Mining said last week the first gold has been poured at
its Nimary gold mine near Wiluna. The mine--in the Yandal Greenstone belt
of Western Australia--is expected to produce approximately 100,000oz/year
of gold for five-and-a-half years at an average cash operating cost of
A$260/oz. The mine's construction and development took less than five
months, with operations beginning Dec 14 when low-grade ore was introduced
into the mill. The plant was expected to reach its full design capacity of
650,000mt/year by the end of the month.

MK GOLD WRITES OFF JEROOY PROJECT

US miner MK Gold said last week it will to write off $6-mil of its $14-mil
investment in the Jerooy gold project in Kyrghyzstan. The company said the
gold recovery from first underground mine and mill and then heap leach test
results suggest Jerooy is unlikely to become an economically viable project
as originally designed. The company has asked Kilborn Engineering to
prepare a new engineering and cost study, to be completed by March 1996,
based on a design that includes open pit mining and milling of the gold
ore. MK Gold will evaluate the new study and discuss the outcome with the
Kyrghyzstan government to determine whether there are viable project
alternatives.

US EPA UNCONCERNED OVER LEAD-ACID BATTERY COMBUSTION

(Washington)
The US Environmental Protection Agency continues to maintain that it does
not need to prohibit the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries in
municipal waste combustors. EPA decided in 1991 that it would not prohibit
the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries, but the decision was
challenged in the US Court of Appeals, which remanded the issue back to EPA
in June of 1992.
   In a published notice prepared prior to the current partial US
government shutdown, EPA stated that it concludes it is unnecessary to
include lead-acid battery combustion restrictions because additional
efforts to remove batteries from municipal waste combustors would have
little impact on the amount of lead entering the waste combustors and
little effect on controlled lead emissions.
   EPA cited tests and studies showing that the facilities typically have
only one battery per 300 megagrams (Mg) to 700 Mg of municipal solid waste,
and that a significant percentage of batteries do not make it to municipal
combustors. EPA assumed a lead-acid battery recycling rate of 94.4%, so
that only about 5-mil out of 87.8-mil batteries generated were not recycled
in 1992. It noted that 37 states have battery recycling laws based on the
Battery Council International model rule, with mandatory take-back and
deposit requirements.
   As many as 45-mil batteries may be stored in individual households, EPA
maintains, so ``battery storage by households, therefore, may represent a
significant reservoir of automotive-type lead-acid batteries that do not
immediately enter the municipal solid waste stream or the recycling
system.''
In addition, a test program conducted at the Burnaby, BC, municipal waste
combuster found that ``lead-acid batteries do not appear to be a measurable
source of stack gas Pb emission,'' EPA said.
