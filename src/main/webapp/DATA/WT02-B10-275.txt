<p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
<blockquote> <p>The exciting connections being made between brain,
mind and behavior have made training in psychiatry and related
sciences a challenge of considerable intellectual complexity. The
variety of course offerings match the extraordinary diversity of
research and clinical activity of the Institute, from the most refined
brain research to the broadest epidemiological investigations, from
studies of brief, specifically targeted psychotherapies to studies of
services and health policy. <br> At Psychiatric Institute, clinical
education falls into several categories:<br> * Psychiatric Education
for medical students<br> * Residency Training for psychiatrists<br> *
Child Psychiatry Residency and Fellowships<br> * Post-Residency
Fellowship Training in Psychiatric Research <br> * Post-Residency
Fellowships in Public Psychiatry<br> * Internship Training Program in
Psychology<br> * Training Programs in Nursing, Social Work,
Occupational Therapy, and Recreational Therapy <br> <br> The Institute
also offers research fellowships in schizophrenia, affective disorders
and substance abuse, fellowships in consultation-liaison, in
geriatrics and in HIV-related disorders. The co-existence of all these
sub-specialties, as well as the immediate availability of the finest
research faculty and research technology provides an atmosphere of
extraordinary stimulation for the scores of professionals completing
their postgraduate studies here each year. The graduates of
Psychiatric Institute's educational programs continue to be the
leaders of their fields becoming heads of academic and clinical
departments, as well as public service programs, in centers and
communities across the country. They also assume leadership positions
in psychiatric, psychological and psychoanalytic organizations and
become editors of the most respected journals.</p> </blockquote>
<p><strong>PRACTICE AND RESEARCH IN PSYCHOTHERAPY</strong></p>
<blockquote> <p>Founded in 1945 in the Department of Psychiatry of
Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, the
Psychoanalytic Center for Training and Research is located at
Psychiatric Institute. The founders recognized that interpersonal
therapies and medicine would benefit from a close relationship which
emphasized the interaction of the biological sources of human
motivation with cultural, developmental and environmental forces. In
that context, the faculty provide courses on the theory and practice
of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and supervision of psychodynamic
psychotherapy. <br> <font size=1></font></p> </blockquote> <p><font
