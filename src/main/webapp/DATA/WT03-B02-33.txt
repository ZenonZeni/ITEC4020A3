MARKET BRIEFING

Most insurers include employers and public liability cover as part of a
specifically designed contractor's package.  A few, such as Commercial
Union and Eagle Star, use their standard liability wordings
appropriately tailored for the risk concerned.  General Accident, which
recently introduced a combined liability policy specifically for the
construction industry, uses instead its more general combined liability
policy where the construction element of the business is less than 10%.

Most contractors' liability covers offer a wide range of extensions,
although policies designed for small businesses may be more restricted,
for example omitting overseas cover.  Some insurers also have standard
endorsements for different trades.

Following a poor safety record and a significant number of death and
injury claims, there are now signs that liability claims experience in
the UK construction industry is improving.  The 1994/95 Health and
Safety Commission annual report, published last November, stated that
fatal injuries in construction during 1994/95 continued the steady
downward trend and were expected to be the lowest in eight years.  The
provisional fatality rate for the construction workforce was 4.7 per
hundred thousand.

In a key move to reduce accidents, the Construction Design and
Management (CDM) Regulations were  introduced on 31 March 1995.  These
implement the design and management aspects of the EC Temporary or
Mobile Construction Sites Directive, placing statutory duties on all
those involved in construction work to minimise accident and health
risks.  To avoid disrupting projects already underway at 31 March,
those involved in existing projects were allowed up to nine months in
which to comply with the regulations - which means that all qualifying
construction work should now be implementing CDM.  The regulations do
not apply to

* construction work, other than demolition, that does not last longer
than 30 working days or 500 person work days and does not involve more
than four people

* construction work for a domestic client

* construction work carried out inside offices and shops or similar
premises without interrupting the normal activities of the premises and
without separating the construction activities from the other
activities

* the maintenance or removal of insulation on pipes, boilers or other
parts of heating or water systems.

Under the new rules, clients, designers, planning supervisors,
principal contractors, contractors and self-employed workers acting as
contractors have clearly defined duties which they must carry out as
far as reasonably practicable.  A key element is the provision and
implementation of a health and safety plan and construction must not
start until this has been prepared.

DISCOUNTED RATES FOR TERRORISM

Pool Re is offering a 20% discount on premium rates for 1996.  Insureds
will be required to pay 60% of the discounted annual premium at the
beginning of the policy period.  The 40% remaining will not be
collected as long as losses are not in excess of #75m.  No claims were
made on the pool last year.

FUTURE FOR CAPTIVES?

Following Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's decision to increase the taxation
of controlled foreign companies from 50% to 90%, AIRMIC's Captive
Special Interest Group has been considering the implications for the
viability of offshore captive insurers owned by UK companies.  It
concludes that

* risk managers are under no pressure to take drastic or immediate
action with regard to the operation of their captive insurers.  Some
major organisations are still actively considering the possibility of
setting up offshore captives

* AIRMIC members' captive insurers have not been established for purely
tax reasons, but to provide the broadest cover to their companies at
lowest prudent cost

* captives are still the critical component of their risk financing
strategies, and provide the ability to meet their needs in the face of
the unpredictability of the insurance and reinsurance markets.

EMSS RESEARCH BEGINS

The Loss Prevention Council (LPC) is collaborating with Imperial
College London to investigate the links between Environmental
Management Systems (EMSs) and insurance.  EMSs are new tools by which
insurers may be able to assess and quantify the environmental
performance of their clients.  The LPC says that governments and
international agencies agree that continued, sustainable economic
development depends on the availability of adequate insurance cover for
environmental risks.  However, insurers are said to be wary of such
risks, particularly because of past experiences in the United States.

A three-year study entitled The Response of the Insurance Industry to
Developments in Environmental Management Systems recently began at the
Centre for Environmental Technology at Imperial College London.  The
research is aimed at analysing the response of insurers to the
introduction of EMSs as expressed in their attitudes towards their
clients' environmental performance, as well as supplying insurers with
information gathered during the study on the usefulness and benefits of
EMSs.

The study will also address the following questions.  What are the main
constraints on the environmental insurance market?  Are these caused by
uncertainties in technical assessment, or other problems such as
long-term uncertainty in legal liability?  How do insurers currently
assess the environmental performance of their clients - if at all?

In the medium term, the study aims to determine whether and to what
extent compliance with EMSs standards supports insurers' own assessment
systems, and also whether and how insurers might effectively use EMSs
in their assessments.

incentive, Longford Insurance Schemes are currently offering selected
intermediaries up to 60% commission on new sales.

SAFETY SCHEME LAUNCHED

Minister for Local Transport and Road Safety Steven Norris has launched
DriveCare - a safety scheme targeted at commercial vehicles (including
heavy goods, commercial goods vehicles and coaches).  This sector is
responsible for nearly 45,000 of all road accident injuries in the UK.
Similar schemes in use in the USA over the past decade have resulted in
a 25% drop in commercial vehicle accident fatalities.

DriveCare encourages owners and operators of commercial vehicles along
with general motorists to take a pro-active approach to road safety.
Subscribing owners of commercial vehicles display a sticker which
includes a free-phone number on the rear of each vehicle in their
fleet.  Motorists who witness a driver driving dangerously, carelessly,
discourteously or speeding can telephone and lodge their complaint.
This is registered on the DriveCare database and the owner of the
vehicle is immediately faxed with the details of the incident.  The
owner is then in a position to take the necessary steps to counsel or
discipline the driver or provide further driver training.

The system originated in the USA where it is now estimated that over
80% of all commercial vehicles display the sticker.

SHOP AND OFFICE PACKAGES RELAUNCHED

HOTEL PROTECT

Conference specialist Insurex Expo-Sure launches a new policy for
hoteliers in February.  Hotel Protect provides for all costs which have
been pre-booked, such as deposits, room hire, accommodation or delegate
charges, to be paid back to the conference organiser should delegates
be prevented from arriving by any reason out of their control.  The
insurance is set in place at the time of booking by the hotelier adding
a premium of #1.75 per person per night (plus the hotelier's handling
fee) to the delegate rate.

Initially the policy is available for bookings of a minimum two nights
and is aimed primarily at the conference delegate or group bookings.
The cover also includes roadside assistance whereby a delegate breaking
down en route to the hotel will be towed to the nearest garage,
provided with emergency overnight accommodation if required and given
the cost of onward travel to the original hotel.  Hotel Protect is
underwritten by Home & Overseas.
