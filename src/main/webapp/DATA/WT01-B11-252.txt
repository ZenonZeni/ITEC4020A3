<B><FONT SIZE=2>Management of the Funds</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment adviser to each Fund (the &quot;Adviser&quot;)
is Norwest Investment Management, a part of Norwest Bank Minnesota,
N.A. (&quot;Norwest&quot;). Norwest is a subsidiary of Norwest
Corporation, a multi-bank holding company that was incorporated
under the laws of Delaware in 1929. As of December 31, 1995, Norwest
Corporation was the 11th largest bank holding company in the United
States in terms of assets. As of that date, the Adviser managed
or provided investment advice with respect to assets totaling
approximately $23 billion. Except for International Fund, the
Adviser makes investment decisions for the Funds and continuously
reviews, supervises and administers each Fund's investment program.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Subject to the Adviser's general oversight, Crestone
Capital Management, Inc. (&quot;Crestone&quot;), a subsidiary
of Norwest, acts as investment subadviser to Small Company Stock
Fund. Subject to the Adviser's general oversight, Schroder Capital
Management International Inc. (&quot;Schroder&quot;) acts as investment
subadviser to Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund and
each Balanced Fund (Schroder, Crestone and the Adviser are sometimes
referred to collectively as the &quot;Advisers&quot;). Schroder
also serves as International Portfolio's investment adviser. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Norwest serves as the Trust's transfer agent, dividend
disbursing agent and custodian, and provides certain administrative
services to International Fund. The manager of the Trust and distributor
of its shares is Forum Financial Services, Inc. (&quot;Forum&quot;).
Forum also serves as administrator of Core Trust. See &quot;Management
of the Funds - Investment Advisory Services&quot; and &quot;Administrative
and Other Services.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Purchase and Redemption of Shares</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Shares of beneficial interest of each Fund are offered
without a sales charge and may be redeemed without charge. Norwest
offers investors in the Funds various periodic investment and
redemption services. The minimum initial investment in each Fund
is $1,000, except that the minimum initial investment in Ready
Cash Investment Fund is $100,000. See &quot;Purchases and Redemptions
of Shares.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Certain Risk Factors</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There can be no assurance that any Fund will achieve
its investment objective or that Ready Cash Investment Fund will
maintain a stable net asset value. Except for Ready Cash Investment
Fund, each Fund's net asset value will fluctuate based upon changes
in the value of the Fund's portfolio securities and, accordingly,
upon redemption an investment in a Fund may be worth more or less
than its original value. The Fixed Income Funds' net asset values
will tend to vary inversely with movements in interest rates and
the potential for appreciation in a Fixed Income Fund in the event
of a decline in interest rates may be limited or negated by increased
principal prepayments on certain mortgage-backed securities held
by the Fund. The policy of investing in smaller companies employed
by Small Company Stock Fund, Small Company Growth Fund and the
Equity Funds and Balanced Funds that invest in small company securities
entails certain risks in addition to those normally associated
with investments in equity securities. Similarly, Contrarian Stock
Fund's policy of investing in securities that may be out of favor
with many institutional investors and International Fund's policy
of investing directly or indirectly in foreign securities entail
certain risks in addition to those normally associated with investments
in equity securities. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By investing solely in International Portfolio, International
Fund may achieve certain efficiencies and economies of scale.
Nonetheless, this investment could also have potential adverse
effects on International Fund. Investors in International Fund
should consider these risks, as described under &quot;Other Information
- Core Trust Structure.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An investment in any Fund involves certain risks,
depending on the types of investments made and the types of investment
techniques employed. All investments by the Funds entail some
risk. Certain investments and investment techniques, however,
entail additional risks, such as investments in foreign issuers,
issuers with limited market capitalization, mortgage- or asset-backed
securities, zero-coupon bonds and options, futures contracts,
forward contracts and swap agreements. The use of leverage by
certain Funds through borrowings, margin transactions, short sales,
reverse repurchase agreements and other investment techniques
involves additional risks. For more details about each Fund and
its investments and risks, see &quot;Investment Objectives, Policies
and Risk Considerations&quot; and &quot;Appendix A: Investments,
Investment Strategies and Risk Considerations.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The purpose of the following table is to assist investors
in understanding the various expenses that an investor in the
Funds will bear directly or indirectly. There are no transaction
charges in connection with purchases, redemptions or exchanges
of Shares. None of the Funds has adopted a Rule 12b-1 plan with
respect to the Shares and, accordingly, no Fund incurs distribution
expenses with respect to the Shares. <BR>

<P>
(1) For a further description of the various expenses incurred
in the operation of the Funds, see &quot;Management of the Funds.&quot;
For Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Total Return
Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment Fund, the amounts of expenses
are based on amounts incurred during those Funds' most recent
fiscal year ended May 31, 1995 and for the other Funds during
their most recent fiscal year ended October 31, 1995. With respect
to Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Index Fund
and Total Return Bond Fund, expense information has been restated
to reflect current expenses, as if these expenses had been in
effect for each Fund's most recent fiscal year. <BR>
<P>
The table reflects an increase in Income Equity Fund's advisory
fee from 0.50% which is expected to be approved by that Fund's
shareholders at a meeting to be held in April 1996. Prior to such
approval, the Fund will continue to pay an advisory fee of 0.50%
of its average daily net assets. <BR>
<P>
Absent actual (or, in the case of Contrarian Stock Fund, Small
Company Stock Fund and Total Return Bond Fund, estimated) expense
reimbursements and fee waivers, the Investment Advisory Fees of
Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Managed Fixed
Income Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment
Fund would be: 0.80%, 1.00%, 0.35%, 0.50% and 0.38% respectively.

<P>
(2) International Fund's Other Expenses include the Fund's pro
rata portion of the operating expenses of International Portfolio,
which will be borne indirectly by International Fund shareholders.
As long as its assets are invested in International Portfolio,
International Fund pays no investment advisory fees directly.
International Fund pays Forum a management fee, and Core Trust
pays Forum an administration fee for its services to International
Portfolio, of which International Fund bears its pro rata portion.
The Board of Trustees of the Trust believes that the aggregate
per share expenses of International Fund and International Portfolio
will be approximately equal to the expenses International Fund
would incur if its assets were invested directly in foreign securities.
Pursuant to an exemptive order obtained from the SEC, Diversified
Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate
Balanced Fund and Growth Balanced Fund invest portions of their
assets in other portfolios of Core Trust, each of which bears
certain expenses not reflected in the table. See &quot;Investment
Objectives, Policies and Risk Considerations - Investments in
Core Trust&quot; and &quot;Management of the Funds - Expenses
of the Funds.&quot;<BR>
<P>
(3) Other Expenses for the Funds include transfer agency fees
payable to Norwest at annual rates of 0.10% of Ready Cash Investment
Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Institutional
Shares and 0.25% of each other Fund's average daily net assets
attributable to I Shares. Other Expenses for Contrarian Stock
Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Ready
Cash Investment Fund also include custodial fees payable to Norwest
at a annual rate of up to 0.05% of each Fund's average daily net
assets; Norwest charges no custodian fees to the other Funds,
but they incur subcustodian fees. In addition, Other Expenses
for International Fund include administrative service fees payable
to Norwest of 0.25%. <BR>

<P>
The above table is a hypothetical example that indicates the expenses
an investor would pay assuming a $1,000 investment in each Fund,
a 5 percent annual return, reinvestment of all dividends and distributions,
and full redemption at the end of each period. The example is
based on the expenses listed in the &quot;Annual Fund Operating
Expenses&quot; table above. The 5 percent annual return is not
a prediction of and does not represent the Funds' projected returns;
rather, it is required by government regulation. <I>The example
should not be considered a representation of past or future expenses
or return. Actual expenses and return may be greater or less than
indicated. 2.</I>
