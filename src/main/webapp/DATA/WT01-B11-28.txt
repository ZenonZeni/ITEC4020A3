<H2> Ford Tightens Embrace of Mazda </H2>

<EM> Reported on RX-7 mail list. </EM>

<P> Tokyo, April 12, 1996 (Reuter)

<P> Mazda Motor Corp said on Friday it and Ford Motor Co had agreed on a
closer tie-up aimed at creating the world's strongest automobile group
in the future.

<P> "Mazda and Ford have agreed to boost the existing strategic
cooperation on a global basis," Mazda said in a statement issued in
Tokyo.  "The strengthening of the ties means a continuation of the
business relationship between the two companies which started in the
1960s and a steady expansion of the relationship which followed an
equity tie-up in 1979. With this move we aim to become the world's
strongest group in the future," it said.

<P> Ford will boost its stake in Mazda to 33.4 percent from 22.54
percent and install a seconded Ford executive as Mazda's president, the
statement said.  Analysts say the one-third stake will give the U.S. car
giant a greater say in the running of Mazda, Japan's fifth-largest
vehicle manufacturer.

<P> Under the deal, Mazda will also make an allocation of 144.1 million
shares to Ford worth 52.3083 billion yen ($484 million). Mazda said this
needed governmental approval.

<P> Mazda said its president Yoshihiro Wada would become chairman and be
replaced by Henry Wallace, a Ford official already seconded to Mazda and
currently serving as Mazda's executive vice president.

<P> Through the agreement, Mazda and Ford would aim to increase their
respective profits, Mazda said, adding that the agreement would not
involve any sacrifice by either firm.

<P> Mazda said it would maintain a clear, separate identity and continue
its own distribution of Mazda-developed products.  It also said it would
maintain its own distribution network.  The agreement would allow both
companies to fully utilise their resources in order to boost efficiency
and competitiveness, Mazda said.  "We will each become a source of
products to the other in order to increase efficiency and gain from the
merits of scale to further boost competitiveness," it said.

<P> Mazda said Sumitomo Bank Ltd, a key shareholder, positively
supported its agreement with Ford. It did not elaborate.

<H2> Ford takes wheel at Mazda with new president, ups stake </H2>

<KBD> From: bclark@ccmailpc.ctron.com </KBD>

<P> TOKYO - Ford Motor Co. is taking the wheel at Mazda Motor Corp., a
move that could give the U.S. company a foothold in Asia and provide a
much-needed boost for the ailing Japanese automaker.

<P> The two companies said in a joint statement Friday that Ford would
increase its share in Mazda to 33.4%, and that Mazda's president would
step aside, ceding management control to a former Ford executive.

<P> The increased share alone does not give Ford control, but analysts
said that coupled with the management shakeup, it effectively puts the
U.S. company in the driver's seat.  "Ford and Mazda believe that closer
coordination of our cooperative strategies and plans, particularly in
the areas of product development, manufacturing and distribution of
vehicles, will enable both companies to improve competitiveness and to
achieve improved economies of scale and efficiencies," Wayne Booker,
executive vice president of Ford, said in a statement.

<P> Analysts saw benefits for both companies.

<P> "This means that Mazda has decided that it would be very difficult
to accomplish financial recovery on its own," said Masahiro Kushida, an
auto analyst at Daiwa Research Institute, a private research
organization.  "It's a big relief for Mazda that it can expect firm
backing from Ford."  Ford, for its part, can benefit from Mazda's
technology know-how in compact cars, while raising its profile in Asia,
Kushida said.

<P> In recent years, Ford has been pouring cash and management expertise
into Mazda, which has seen its sales sag significantly since the decade
began. Ford bought about 25% of Mazda in 1979, and had maintained the
level of its stake until now.

<P> Under the shakeup, Mazda's president, Yoshihiro Wada, will take the
largely ceremonial post of chairman. Wada is a banker who had been sent
in from Sumitomo Bank, the second-largest shareholder in Mazda after
Ford.  Replacing him is former Ford Venezuela president Henry Wallace,
who became executive vice president of the Japanese company in 1994.

<P> Mazda said in a statement that it would maintain a "distinct
identity" and would continue to offer its own products through its own
distribution channels.

<P> In recent years, Mazda's high domestic production ratio and
dependence on exports have made it vulnerable to the strong yen, which
makes Japanese products more expensive overseas.  Mazda's performance in
the U.S. market has been dismal. Its U.S. sales in 1995 fell 24% from
the previous year. So far in 1996, its sales have been down 18% from a
year ago.  And the automaker lost $380 million in the fiscal year that
ended in March 1995. It was in the midst of a restructuring program to
trim its payrolls to 26,000 workers by March this year, for a total
reduction of 4,000 jobs over three years.  Larger Japanese automakers
like Toyota and Honda have had better success in shielding themselves
from currency fluctuations by aggressively moving production offshore.

<P> Ford and Mazda jointly manufacture vehicles in Michigan and New
Zealand, and they have announced a venture to build pickup trucks in
Thailand. They also have collaborated on the development of vehicles,
the latest being the 1997 versions of the Ford Escort and Mercury
Tracer.

<P> Can anyone report on the Detroit News Business page from Sunday
Apr. 7?  With the color picture of a red RX-7 under the title
"... failure of Japanese Marketing".  Apparently Autoweek shows a
Miata at the New York Auto Show with "RX lines".
