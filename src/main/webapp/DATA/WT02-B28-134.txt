<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Keeping Your Business in the Family
</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Owning your own business is a most cherished American dream. 
While a family-owned business
can provide financial benefits - capital growth, salary, fringe
benefits etc. - the real
benefits are often
more personal.  A family-owned firm can provide a better working
environment than a large
impersonal
company.  Family members can take pride in seeing the family name
on products and on the sign
outside the door.  A well run family firm not only stresses
personal service and customer
loyalty, but
also provides benefits to the local community.<P>
	Some business owners build a business with an eye to selling it
to the highest bidder. 
Many
entrepreneurs, however, hope that the business they have built
will remain within the family. 
When
members of the founding generation retire, with proper business
continuation plans in place,
they can
take pleasure in knowing that the firm is in good hands.  Such
happy endings, however, cannot
be
taken for granted.  According to a study by the Journal of
Accountancy, fewer than fifty
percent of family
businesses survive past the second generation.
<P>
<STRONG>Challenges to Retaining the Business in the
Family</STRONG><BR>
	
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><STRONG>No Qualified or Interested Family Member:</STRONG>
Some firms do have an
employee
who could run the business, but that person is not a family
member.  Perhaps the children are
too
young, have other interests, or lack the founder's drive, feel
for the market, or technical
skills.
<LI><STRONG>Limited Access to Capital:</STRONG>  A child may not
have the same relationship
with
the bankers, suppliers, bonding company, and customers as the
prior generation.
<LI><STRONG>Death, Disability, or Retirement: </STRONG> Senior
management may leave, whether
through death, disability, or retirement, before the next
generation is prepared to assume
control.
<LI><STRONG>Disgruntled Second-Tier Management:</STRONG>  A
senior employee who has given
his or her life to a company may find it difficult to work for a
"boss" young enough to be
his or her child. 
First-rate salaried managers often leave to become the next
generation's most potent
competitors.
<LI><STRONG>Current Income versus Growth of Firm:</STRONG>  The
retired generation may be
concerned about income to meet living expenses.  The children may
want to retain profits to
grow the
business.  That could spell trouble.
<LI><STRONG>Estate Taxes:</STRONG>  A closely held corporation is
an illiquid asset.  Taxes
are
assessed based on "fair market value" at a date of death.  Fair
market value is what a
"Willing seller
would accept from a willing buyer."  Often, however, there are no
willing buyers.  Other
assets, or even
the firm itself, may have to be liquidated to cover the estate
taxes due.
<LI><STRONG>Family Differences:</STRONG> The eldest daughter has
an aptitude for business,
but
her husband has transferred to another city.  The son wants to
run the business, and lives in
town, but 
has much to learn.  How are parents to do what is right for each
child, when they have only
one large
illiquid asset to divide?
</UL>

<P>
	Obviously, business continuity planning is not simple.  Some of
the problems are reducible
to
money.  Money can provide for estate taxes,
purchase a retiring owner's
interest, or
provide an equivalent asset for the children who will not enter
the business.  Along with the
financial
considerations, appropriate legal agreements may need to be
drafted, and coordinated with the
will and
estate plan.<P>
	It is up to the business owner to set the planning wheels in
motion.  Here's how to begin:
<P>
<STRONG>Planning Steps</STRONG><BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><STRONG>Clarify Goals:</STRONG>  What would you, as an
owner, prefer?  To work in the
business for as long as possible?  To retire at a certain age? 
To provide for your children
the lifestyle
and status you have enjoyed?  To reward key employees who have
helped you build the business?
	<LI><STRONG>Consider the Children:</STRONG>  Who wants to
continue the firm?  What are the
feelings of the others?  Who, if anyone, has the needed
abilities?  What training is taking
place now?
	<LI><STRONG>Appoint a Project Manager:</STRONG>  No person is
likely to have all the skills
needed to make your vision of the future a reality.  Your
attorney, CPA, banker, and
insurance advisor
are all essential members of your strategic planning team.  You
may want to give one the
overall
responsibility of researching the possible strategies and
presenting recommendations for your
approval.
</UL>
<P>
	As the owner of a family business, you made the company what it
is today.  Some simple
planning
can help ensure that your business continues to thrive for many
years.
