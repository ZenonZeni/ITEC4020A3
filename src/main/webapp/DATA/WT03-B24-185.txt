<B>Corporate Overview:</B><BR>
The mission of ONYX is to develop novel therapeutics to treat serious diseases.  Our central research activity is to combine the latest molecular biology techniques with the expanding knowledge of intracellular signaling pathways to develop new strategies for therapeutic discovery.  Our business model is to stay focused on research and drug discovery, while seeking corporate partners for clinical development and commercialization.<P>

<B>Technology Overview:</B><P>
ONYX has established three initial drug discovery programs with a near-term focus on molecular oncology:<P>

<EM>Ras Signaling:</EM><BR> 
ONYX's first drug discovery program, now the subject of the ONYX/Bayer collaboration, focuses on the Ras signaling pathway.  Ras is a protein which is activated by a family of growth factors and plays a key role in controlling cell growth and differentiation.

Small molecule drugs that turn off Ras activity or reduce it to normal levels may offer effective new therapies for many cancers, as well as other hyperproliferative diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.<P>

<EM>Cell Cycle Regulators:</EM><BR>
ONYX research also focuses on proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle.  ONYX and its corporate partner, the Parke-Davis division of Warner-Lambert, hope to develop new therapeutics for cancer and other diseases.  Potential products may act by restoring the normal function of mutated cell cycle proteins or by otherwise restoring the normal growth/death cycle to abnormal cells.<P>

<EM>Adenovirus Therapy for p53 Mutated Tumors:</EM><BR>
A key discovery was made at ONYX that adenovirus can be modified to selectively replicate in and kill tumor cells deficient in p53, but not normal cells.  In vitro  and in vivo  experiments have validated the concept, and the product is scheduled to enter the clinic early in 1996.  This discovery is being extended to other viruses and diseases.<P>

<B>Current Corporate Partners:</B>
<UL><LI> Bayer
<LI> Parke-Davis
<LI> Eli Lilly
</UL>

<B>Corporate Partnering Opportunities:</B><BR>
ONYX will continue to apply its strategy to create corporate alliances for each of its product programs. The company expects to complete an alliance in the area of adenovirus therapy for p53-mutated tumors in 1996.  It is also seeking with Warner-Lambert a Japanese partner for the cell cycle collaboration.<P>
