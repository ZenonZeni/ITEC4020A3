<CENTER><H1>Editorial</H1><P>
From the inaugural issue published in the Fall, 1995</CENTER><BR>

	We have long thought it remarkable that, although the ocean covers 70.92 percent of the Earth's surface, and an immense number of people occupy themselves on and under its waters (often with great passion and purpose), there is no periodical devoted solely to chronicling the wide range of events occurring in this vast realm. Marine Watch, a quarterly news journal of which this is the first issue, is a modest attempt to fulfill such a purpose. <P>
	We launch this endeavor with reverence, mindful that the sea is not only one of Nature's greatest forces, magnificent and unfathomable, but as well the setting of great historical events and the crucible of a tradition and ethos that transcend politics and nationality. We are aware, too, that we are addressing the interests of an informed readership, men and women who collectively possess an extraordinary range of expertise and a deep appreciation of the marine world and the lore of the sea. <P>
	This global ocean community is roughly comprised of two groups. On the one hand are scientists, researchers, skilled specialists and scholars in government, academia, and the private sector whose work involves the marine world and the earth sciences (their number and diversity of disciplines is extraordinary).  And on the other are professional mariners, sailors, boaters, underwater archeologists, sport and commercial fishers, surfers, divers, treasure salvers, and blue water adventurers. The impression we have gained from a quarter century of writing about the ocean, and ocean people, is that each group is keenly interested in the experiences of the other, has a lot to share, and would be pleased to share it. Our hope is that Marine Watch will prove a worthy venue for such an exchange. To this end we invite our readers to contact us with news of their activities, experiences and items of interest. <P>
	As a glance at this issue's table of contents suggests, the scope of Marine Watch's interests is broad: shipwrecks and rescues, scientific discoveries, undersea exploration, treasure salvage, blue water cruising, surf stories, sea stories, unusual ice berg calving, severe weather, ocean oddities, and offshore oil field diving, to name only a few. <P>
	Regardless of the subject, the writing is geared for readers with a high level of comprehension. We don't expect every surfer or sailor to be conversant with Doppler hook echoes and Kelvin waves, nor every scientist to know what a backside layback stall is, or a helium unscrambler, or the difference between a checkerboard and a trawl door. However, in providing substantive, in-depth reporting, Marine Watch will not avoid <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="grissim.gif" ALT="[photo of John Grissam]">the technical or the arcane. We believe our readers have the expertise and the marine experience to dope out what they need to know - and prefer it that way. <P>
	Our editorial philosophy is, in general, non-political, but underlying much that will be reported will be an implicit awareness of the environmental emergency that has begun to manifest in Earth's oceans.  We are concerned less with the lubberly disputes of shore folk than with accurate reporting about things that actually happen. Wherever possible, we will go to the source. Our objective is to convey the unalloyed power of events, told first hand by the participants in their own voices. In so doing, Marine Watch will be better able to convey (and on occasion celebrate) the profound affinity and love that the worldwide ocean community has for the waves and waters of that realm from whence we all came, the ineffable Great Deep. <P>
