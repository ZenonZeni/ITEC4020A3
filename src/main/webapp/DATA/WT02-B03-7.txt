<p> <b>APPENDIX 2. </b> </p>

<h1>INDUSTRIAL AND HORTICULTURAL USES OF CANNABIS </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Since ancient times the fibres from the cannabis or hemp
plant have been used to make fabric, rope and paper ([1]Abel
1980). In World War II, the USA grew 50,000 acres of hemp, as
part of their war effort ([2]see United States Government 1944,
Hemp for Victory), and hemp fibres were used to make rope for
ships and the canvas used in parachutes. </p>

<p> More recently, experimental crops of a low THC-content
species of cannabis have been grown in The Netherlands, Italy,
Spain, France and Tasmania. Its fibres have been used in the
production of paper and fabric. Australian groups such as the
Business Alliance for Commercial Hemp argue that Australia should
allow the cultivation of hemp for industrial purposes. The
position is that, if a State or Territory Government authorises
the growing of cannabis, the Commonwealth will issue a permit for
the importation of seeds, provided that the applicant for the
import permit meets the criteria set out in the Act, such as
being 'a fit and proper person'. </p>

<p> The trade magazine for the US paper industry recently argued
that hemp has a number of advantages over timber in the area of
paper production, and there are a number of strong environmental
arguments for the commercial cultivation of hemp. Every four
months, each acre of hemp grown will produce 10 tons of fibre. It
can produce four times the amount of paper per acre than
20-year-old trees can, it requires less bleaching than pulp from
timber and, because it is a very densely growing crop, weeds are
choked and there is less need for pesticides and herbicides
([3]Young 1991). In addition, hemp requires less watering and
pesticides than cotton and produces a fibre that is argued to be
more durable than cotton fabrics ([4]Cowperthwaite 1993). </p>

<p> The United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs allows
the cultivation of cannabis for industrial and horticultural
purposes. Article 28(2) states that 'this Convention should not
apply to the cultivation of the cannabis plant exclusively for
industrial purposes (fibre and seed) or horticultural purposes'.
Australian drug legislation permits the cultivation of cannabis
for scientific purposes and some limited experimentation has
already taken place in Australia. </p>

<p> However, groups such as the Business Alliance for Commerical
Hemp argue that the full benefits of hemp production can only be
obtained if hemp is grown on a wider scale, and that cannabis
with a very low THC content can be grown for industrial purposes.
Legislation permitting the cultivation of cannabis for industrial
purposes could be included in existing drug legislation, however,
as with the medicinal use of cannabis, introducing legislation
that recognises the industrial uses of a substance that is
thought of simply as a dangerous illicit drug may pose political
difficulties for those advocating legislative change. </p>
