Physical examination is now demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing
breast-cancer mortality, according to a study reported in Lancet. Mammography
detects many non-infiltrating and small, non-palpable tumors, but it is not known
whether these would ever cause symptoms or threaten a woman's life. It is
doubtful, according to this study, that the time gained by early detection confers
any survival benefit over physical examination in terms of human and economic
costs.

"THE QUESTION WE SHOULD
<br>
BE ASKING IS WHETHER
<br>
WE NEED MAMMOGRAPHIC
<br>
SCREENING AT ALL."
</center>
<p>

"The question we should be asking,î state the researchers, "is not how to refine
mammographic screening but whether we need it at all ... The widespread
implementation of screening mammography is cutting deeply into scarce health-care
resources at a time of global recession. Current evidence suggests that screening
by physical examination is as effective as screening mammography in reducing
mortality from breast cancer."

"VARIATIONS IN BREAST THICKNESS

COMPOSITION CAN PRODUCE A
<br>
RANGE OF EXPOSURE
<br>
WHICH EXCEEDS THE LATITUDE
<br>
OF MAMMOGRAPHY TESTING
<br>
EQUIPMENT."</center>
<p>
The rationale for asking this question stems from accumulating evidence against
the need for mammography. Several potentially-harmful effects of mammography
screening must be considered, including over-diagnosis, radiation exposure, and
false positive results.

<p>
Recently published seven-year results from the Canadian National Breast Screening
Study showed that in women aged 40 to 49 years, no reduction in breast-cancer
mortality was observed when screened women were compared with unscreened women. 
In women aged 50 to 59 years, breast-cancer mortality was similar when annual
screening using mammography and physical examination was compared with annual
screening using physical examination alone. The American Cancer Society advocates
mammography screening for all women from age 40, whereas in Europe it is not
recommended for women below age 50.  Much remains unknown about the efficacy of
mammography.

<p>
Additional problems relate to women with mammographically-dense breasts. 
Variations in breast thickness and composition can produce a range of exposure
which exceeds the latitude of mammography testing equipment.
