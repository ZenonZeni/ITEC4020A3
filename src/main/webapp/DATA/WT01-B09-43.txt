<p>Recognized as an industry leader, our consortium has combined the technological capabilities of McClellan Air Force Base, the experience of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  and the innovation of many private companies to realize the advantages of electric transportation.</p>

<p>Enhancing the nation's military readiness while creating a new industry is among the many substantial benefits derived from the broad-based multilateral effort.  </p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The Sacramento Mission</FONT></h3></p>


	
<p>The Sacramento Consortium's objectives go hand-in-hand with those of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV).  To date, the Consortium has successfully leveraged federal funds with millions of private dollars to dramatically enhance electric transportation technology research and development on a national scale.  Its goals:
<ul>
<p><li> Stronger national defense through technological superiority, economic and energy security:
<li> Develop advanced, efficient EV components and charging infrastructure to minimize utility system impacts of military and civilian EV charging;
<li> Create and maintain jobs for the nation, state, community and McClellan Air Force Base;
<li> Improve air quality nationwide.</p>
</ul>

</p><p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3></p>
<ul>

<p><b>Fuel Cells</b></p>
<p>Testing of H Power Systems' 10 kilowatt proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack continues. This stack design will lead to a larger 50 to 70 kilowatt system for test and demonstration in buses.  Additionally, an advanced, multi-fuel processor to convert liquid hydrocarbons to hydrogen for the fuel cell is under development.  	Key to both stack performance and cost reduction are the use of patented platelet technology to reduce separator plate mass and meet cost targets for mass produced systems.</p>

<p><b>Advanced Lead-Acid Batteries</b></p>
<p>Field testing is continuing to prove out the Horizon batteries in a variety of SMUD/McClellan vehicles, including sedans, trucks and vans.  Horizon batteries, produced by Electrosource, Inc., deliver the highest specific energy of any advanced lead acid battery  available for electric vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Electrosource S-Fold Battery for Hybrid Vehicles</b></p>
<p>Development of this technology will result in a battery with high voltage and high specific power, with respect to battery volume and mass (750 to 1,000 w/kg), which is 3 to 4 times greater than its nearest competitor.  This battery model will enable successful operation of PNGV hybrid vehicles in the future.</p>

<p><b>Purpose-built EVs</b></p>
<p> A second generation electric pickup truck, Pickup II, premiered at the 1995 DARPA conference. It is a two passenger, lightweight, all-composite vehicle with the following dimensions:  155" long, 62" high and 61" wide. Already road-tested and receiving rave reviews from fleet users, the Pickup II has front wheel drive, a curb weight of 2,100 pounds, Horizon batteries, Brusa motor (gt20-T) and controller (AMC325), safety glass, and 14 inch aluminum wheels with Michelin Proxima tires.</p>
<p>	A multi-year effort to take the Pickup II to production has been initiated, utilizing as many OEM subsystems and components as possible.  The composite process required for large structural components is being developed and the vehicle is being redesigned for improved manufacturability and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>EV Testing & Data Collection</b></p>
<p>  Both monthly energy logging and detailed "time-series" data collected for in-depth study of EV performance is yielding valuable information.   This project has been expanded to upgrade monthly logging hardware, add 8 more vehicles to the "time-series" study program, and develop systems to automatically record performance data from fleet EVs.  "Time-series" data systems are able to record 20-40 individual measurements throughout the vehicle every 200 milliseconds.  This data will allow the analysis of entire vehicle performance as well as subsystems within the vehicle and is needed for new vehicle development efforts, utility power planning, fleet operations planning and infrastructure development.</p>

<p><b>Sacramento Battery Test Facility</b></p>
<p>Equipped with two AeroVironment ABC 150 Advanced Battery Cycler Test Systems this new facility is capable of cycling four battery packs in a variety of cycling regimes such as hybrid EV and rapid charge cycles.  Several new battery management systems developed to maximize capacity and protect life of electric vehicle battery packs will be tested and evaluated here.  Additionally, SMUD will field test the Electrosource Maximizer Battery Management System being developed to ensure longer life for advanced batteries.  It will charge each battery in a pack individually to achieve maximum capacity from the battery pack on every cycle.  Voltage and temperature sensors on each battery are used to provide an accurate "state of charge" reading for the driver.  This proven system is being developed to the robust automotive component stage for the EV industry.</p>

<p><b>Electromechanical Flywheel Battery</b></p>
<p> A working engineering test unit will soon be completed.  Due to substantive progress made by American Flywheel Systems, Inc. since 1995, the fabrication of a flywheel rotor system is scheduled for completion by mid-1996, with testing of an electromechanical flywheel battery engineering unit to begin thereafter.</p>

<p><b>Neighborhood Electric Vehicles</b></p>
<p> Pacific Electric Vehicles is scheduled to complete its Peregrin prototype in May of this year.  This economical monocoque composite chassis is a low performance, 40+ mph two passenger vehicle suitable for residential neighborhoods and campus-type settings.</p>
