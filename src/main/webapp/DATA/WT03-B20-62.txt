<h1> Revisiting Solar Power's Past<br><em>By Charles Smith</em></h1>
Inventors unlocked the secrets of turning the sun's rays into mechnical power 
more than a century ago, only to see their dream machines collapse from lack 
of public support.  Modern solar engineers must not be doomed to relive their fate.

State University, and a doctoral candidate in the Department of Science and Technology 
Studies at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. His primary area of research is the history of energy.

<p>Many of us assume that the nation's first serious push to develop renewable fuels 
was spawned while angry Americans waited in gas lines during the "energy crisis" of 
the 1970s. Held hostage by the OPEC oil embargo, the country suddenly seemed 
receptive to warnings from scientists, environmentalists, and even a few 
politicians to end its overreliance on finite coal and oil reserves or 
face severe economic distress and political upheaval.  </p>

<p> But efforts to design and construct devices for supplying renewable 
energy actually began some 100 years before that turbulent time--ironically, 
at the very height of the Industrial Revolution, which was largely founded 
on the promise of seemingly inexhaustible supplies of fossil fuels. Contrary 
to the prevailing opinion of the day, a number of engineers questioned the 
practice of an industrial economy based on nonrenewable energy and worried 
about what the world's nations would do after exhausting the fuel supply.  </p>

<p> More important, many of these visionaries did not just provide futuristic 
rhetoric but actively explored almost all the renewable energy options 
familiar today. In the end, most decided to focus on solar power, reasoning 
that the potential rewards outweighed the technical barriers. In less than 
50 years, these pioneers developed an impres-sive array of innovative 
techniques for capturing solar radiation and using it to produce the steam 
that powered the machines of that era. In fact, just before World War I, they 
had outlined all of the solar thermal conversion methods now being considered. 
Unfortunately, despite their technical successes and innovative designs, 
their work was largely forgotten for the next 50 years in the rush to 
develop fossil fuels for an energy-hungry world.</p>

<p>Now, a century later, history is repeating itself. After following the 
same path as the early inventors--in some cases reinventing the same 
techniques--contemporary solar engineers have arrived at the same conclusion: 
solar power is not only possible but eminently practical, not to mention more 
environmentally friendly. Alas, once again, just as the technology has proven 
itself from a practical standpoint, public support for further development 
and implementation is eroding, and solar power could yet again be eclipsed 
by conventional energy technologies.</p>
<h3>The First Solar Motor</h3>
<p>The earliest known record of the direct conversion of solar radiation 
into mechanical power belongs to Auguste Mouchout, a mathematics instructor
at the LycŽe de Tours. Mouchout began his solar work in 1860 after expressin
grave concerns about his country's dependence on coal. "It would be prudent 
and wise not to fall asleep regarding this quasi-security," he wrote. 
"Eventually industry will no longer find in Europe the resources to satisfy
its prodigious expansion. Coal will undoubtedly be used up. What will 
industry do then?" By the following year he was granted the first patent
for a motor running on solar power and continued to improve his design 
until about 1880. During this period the inventor laid the foundation for
our modern understanding of converting solar radiation into mechanical 
steam power. </p>
<p>Mouchout's initial experiments involved a glass-enclosed iron cauldron: 
incoming solar radiation passed through the glass cover, and the trapped 
rays transmitted heat to the water. While this simple arrangement boiled 
water, it was of little practical value because the quantities and 
pressures of steam it produced were minimal. However, Mouchout soon 
discovered that by adding a reflector to concentrate additional radiation
onto the cauldron, he could generate more steam. In late 1865, he 
succeeded in using his apparatus to operate a small, conventional 
steam engine. </p>

<p>By the following summer, Mouchout displayed his solar motor to Emperor 
Napoleon III in Paris. The monarch, favorably impressed, offered financial
assistance for developing an industrial solar motor for France. With the 
newly acquired funds, Mouchout enlarged his invention's capacity, refined
the reflector, redesigning it as a truncated cone, like a dish with slanted 
sides, to more accurately focus the sun's rays on the boiler. Mouchout 
also constructed a tracking mechanism that enabled the entire machine to 
follow the sun's altitude and azimuth, providing uninterrupted solar reception. 
</p>
<p>
After six years of work, Mouchout exhibited his new machine in the library 
courtyard of his Tours home in 1872, amazing spectators. One reporter 
described the reflector as an inverted "mammoth lamp shade...coated on the 
inside with very thin silver leaf" and the boiler sitting in the middle as 
an "enormous thimble" made of blackened copper and "covered with a glass bell".
</p>
<p>Anxious to put his invention to work, he connected the apparatus to a 
steam engine that powered a water pump. On what was deemed "an 
exceptionally hot day," the solar motor produced one-half horsepower. 
Mouchout reported the results and findings to the French Academy of 
Science. The government, eager to exploit the new invention to its 
fullest potential, decided that the most suitable venue for the new 
machine would be the tropical climes of the French protectorate of Algeria,
a region blessed with almost constant sunshine and entirely dependent on 
coal, a prohibitively expensive commodity in the African region. </p>

<p>Mouchout was quickly deployed to Algeria with ample funding to 
construct a large solar steam engine. He first decided to enlarge his 
invention's capacity yetagain to 100 liters (70 for water and 30 for steam) 
and employ a multi-tubed boiler instead of the single cauldron. The boiler 
tubes had a better surface-area-to-water ratio, yielding more pressure and 
improved engine performance. </p>

<p>In 1878, Mouchout exhibited the redesigned invention at the Paris 
Exposition. Perhaps to impress the audience or, more likely, his government 
backers, he coupled the steam engine to a refrigeration device. The steam 
from the solar motor, after being routed through a condenser, rapidly 
cooled the inside of a separate insulated compartment. He explained the 
result: "In spite of the seeming paradox of the statement, [it was] 
possible to utilize the rays of the sun to make ice." Mouchout was 
awarded a medal for his accomplishments.</p>

<p>By 1881 the French Ministry of Public Works, intrigued by Mouchout's 
machine, appointed two commissioners to assess its cost efficiency. But 
after some 900 observations at Montpelier, a city in southern France, 
and Constantine, Algeria, the government deemed the device a technical 
success but a practical failure. One reason was that France had recently 
improved its system for transporting coal and developed a better 
relationship with England, on which it was dependent for that commodity.
The price of coal had thus dropped, rendering the need for alternatives 
less attractive. Unable to procure further financial assistance, Mouchout 
returned to his academic pursuits. </p>

<h3>The Tower of Power</h3>
<p>During the height of Mouchout's experimentation, William Adams, the 
deputy registrar for the English Crown in Bombay, India, wrote an 
award-winning book entitled Solar Heat: A Substitute for Fuel in 
Tropical Countries. Adams noted that he was intrigued with Mouchout's 
solar steam engine after reading an account of the Tours demonstration, 
but that the invention was impractical, since "it would be impossible 
to construct [a dish-shaped reflector] of much greater dimensions" to 
generate more than Mouchout's one-half horsepower. The problem, 
he felt, was that the polished metal reflector would tarnish too easily, 
and would be too costly to build and too unwieldy to efficiently track 
the sun. </p>

<p>Fortunately for the infant solar discipline, the English registrar 
did not spend all his time finding faults in the French inventor's 
efforts, but offered somecreative solutions. For example, Adams was 
convinced that a reflector of flat silvered mirrors arranged in a 
semicircle would be cheaper to construct and easier to maintain. 
His plan was to build a large rack of many small mirrors and adjust 
each one to reflect sunlight in a specific direction. To track the 
sun's movement, the entire rack could be rolled around a semicircular 
track, projecting the concentrated radiation onto a stationary boiler. 
The rack could be attended by a laborer and would have to be moved only 
"three or four times during the day," Adams noted, or more frequently 
to improve performance. </p>

<p>Confident of his innovative arrangement, Adams began construction in late
1878. By gradually adding 17-by-10-inch flat mirrors and measuring the 
rising temperatures, he calculated that to generate the 1,200û F necessary 
to produce steam pressures high enough to operate conventional engines, 
the reflector would require 72 mirrors. To demonstrate the power of the 
concentrated radiation, Adams placed a piece of wood in the focus of the 
mirrored panes where, he noted, "it ignited immediately." He then arranged
the collectors around a boiler, retaining Mouchout's enclosed cauldron 
configuration, and connected it to a 2.5-horsepower steam engine that 
operated during daylight hours "for a fortnight in the compound of [his] 
bungalow."</p>

<p>Eager to display his invention, Adams notified newspapers and 
invited his important friends--including the Army's commander in chief, 
a colonel from the Royal Engineers, the secretary of public works, various 
justices, and principal mill owners--to a demonstration. Adams wrote that 
all were impressed, even the local engineers who, while doubtful that 
solar power could compete directly with coal and wood, thought it could
be a practical supplemental energy source. </p>

<p>Adams's experimentation ended soon after the demonstration, though, 
perhaps because he hadachieved his goal of proving the feasibility of 
his basic design, but more likely because, as some say, he lacked 
sufficient entrepreneurial drive. Even so, his legacy of producing a
powerful and versatile way to harness and convert solar heat survives. 
Engineers today know this design as the Power Tower concept, which 
is one of the best configurations for large scale, centralized solar 
plants. In fact, most of the modern tower-type solar plants follow 
Adams's basic configuration: flat or slightly curved mirrors that 
remain stationary or travel on a semicircular track and either reflect 
light upward to a boiler in a receiver tower or downward to a boiler at
ground level, thereby generating steam to drive an accompanying heat 
engine.</p>
<h3>
Collection without Reflection
</h3>

<p>Even with Mouchout's abandonment and the apparent disenchantment of 
England's sole participant, Europe continued to advance the practical 
application of solar heat, as the torch returned to France and engineer 
Charles Tellier. Considered by many the father of refrigeration, Tellier 
actually began his work in refrigeration as a result of his solar 
experimentation, which led to the design of the first nonconcentrating, 
or non-reflecting, solar motor. </p>

<p><img src ="Smith3.GIF"></p>
<p>In 1885, Tellier installed a solar collector on his roof similar to 
the flat-plate collectors placed atop many homes today for heating 
domestic water. The collector was composed of ten plates, each 
consisting of two iron sheets riveted together to form a water

tight seal, and connected by tubes to form a single unit. Instead of 
filling the plates with water to produce steam, Tellier chose ammonia 
as a working fluid because of its significantly lower boiling point. 
After solar exposure, the containers emitted enough pressurized ammonia 
gas to power a water pump he had placed in his well at the rate of some 
300 gallons per hour during daylight. Tellier considered his solar water 
pump practical for anyone with a south-facing roof. He also thought that 
simply adding plates, thereby increasing the size of the system, would make
industrial applications possible.</p>

<p>By 1889 Tellier had increased 
the efficiency of the collectors by enclosing the top with glass and 
insulating the bottom. He published the results in The Elevation of 
Water with the Solar Atmosphere, which included details on his intentions 
to use the sun to manufacture ice. Like his countryman Mouchout, Tellier 
envisioned that the large expanses of the African plains could become 
industrially and agriculturally productive through the implementation of 
solar power. </p>

<p>In The Peaceful Conquest of West Africa, Tellier argued that a 
consistent and readily available supply of energy would be required to 
power the machinery of industry before the French holdings in Africa could 
be properly developed. He also pointed out that even though the price of 
coal had fallen since Mouchout's experiments, fuel continued to be a 
significant expense in French operations in Africa. He therefore concluded 
that the construction costs of his low-temperature, nonconcentrating solar 
motor were low enough to justify its implementation. He also noted that his 
machine was far less costly than Mouchout's device, with its dish-shaped 
reflector and complicated tracking mechanism.</p>

<p>Yet despite this potential, Tellier evidently decided to pursue his 
refrigeration interests instead, and do so without the aid of solar heat. 
Most likely the profits from conventionally operated refrigerators proved 
irresistible. Also, much of the demand for the new cooling technology now 
stemmed from the desire to transport beef to Europe from North and South 
America. The rolling motion of the ships combined with space limitations 
precluded the use of solar power altogether. And as Tellier redirected his 
focus, France saw the last major development of solar mechanical power on 
her soil until well into the twentieth century. Most experimentation in the 
fledgling discipline crossed the Atlantic to that new bastion of mechanical 
ingenuity, the United States. </p>

<h3>The Parabolic Trough</h3>

<p>Though Swedish by birth, John Ericsson was one of the most influential 
and controversial U.S. engineers of the nineteenth century. While he spent 
his most productive years designing machines of war--his most celebrated 
accomplishment was the Civil War battleship the Monitor--he dedicated the 
last 20 years of his life largely to more peaceful pursuits such as solar 
power. This work was inspired by a fear shared by virtually all of his 
fellow solar inventors that coal supplies would someday end. In 1868 he 
wrote, "A couple of thousand years dropped in the ocean of time will 
completely exhaust the coal fields of Europe, unless, in the meantime, the 
heat of the sun be employed."</p>


<p>Thus by 1870 Ericsson had developed what he claimed to be the first 
solar-powered steam engine, dismissing Mouchout's machine as "a mere toy." 
In truth, Ericsson's first designs greatly resembled Mouchout's devices, 
employing a conical, dish-shaped reflector that concentrated solar 
radiation onto a boiler and a tracking mechanism that kept the reflector 
directed toward the sun. </p>

<p>Though unjustified in claiming his design original, Ericsson soon did 
invent a novel method for collecting solar rays--the parabolic trough. Unlike 
a true parabola, which focuses solar radiation onto a single, relatively small 
area, or focal point, like a satellite television dish, a parabolic trough is 
more akin to an oil drum cut in half lengthwise that focuses solar rays in a 
line across the open side of the reflector. 
This type of reflector offered 
many advantages over its circular (dish-shaped) counterparts: it was 
comparatively simple, less expensive to construct, and, unlike a circular 
reflector, had only to track the sun in a single direction (up and down, if 
lying horizontal, or east to west if standing on end), thus eliminating the 
need for complex tracking machinery. The downside was that the device's 
temperatures and efficiencies were not as high as with a dish-shaped 
reflector, since the configuration spread radiation over a wider area--a 
line rather than a point. Still, when Ericsson constructed a single linear 
boiler (essentially a pipe), placed it in the focus of the trough, 
positioned the new arrangement toward the sun, and connected it to a 
conventional steam engine, he claimed the machine ran successfully, though 
he declined to provide power ratings. <p>
The new collection system became 
popular with later experimenters and eventually became a standard for 
modern plants.

In fact, the largest solar systems in the last decade have opted for 
Ericsson's parabolic trough reflector because it strikes a good engineering 
compromise between efficiency and ease of operation.</p>

<p>For the next 
decade, Ericsson continued to refine his invention, trying lighter materials
for the reflector and simplifying its construction. By 1888, he was so confident
of his design's practical performance that he planned to mass-produce and supply
the apparatus to the "owners of the sunburnt lands on the Pacific coast" for 
agricultural irrigation. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for the struggling discipline, 
Ericsson died the following year. And because he was a suspicious and, some 
said, paranoid man who kept his designs to himself until he filed patent 
applications, the detailed plans for his improved sun motor died with him. 
Nevertheless, the search for a practical solar motor was not abandoned. In 
fact, the experimentation and development of large-scale solar technology 
was just beginning. </p>

<h3>The First Commercial Venture</h3>

<p>Boston resident Aubrey Eneas began his solar motor experimentation in 1892, 
formed the first solar power company (The Solar Motor Co.) in 1900, and 
continued his work until 1905. One of his first efforts resulted in a 
reflector much like Ericsson's early parabolic trough. But Eneas found that 
it could not attain sufficiently high temperatures, and, unable to unlock 
his predecessor's secrets, decided to scrap the concept altogether and 
return to Mouchout's truncated-cone reflector. Unfortunately, while 
Mouchout's approach resulted in higher temperatures, Eneas was still 
dissatisfied with the machine's performance. His solution was to make 
the bottom of the reflector's truncated cone-shaped dish larger by 
designing its sides to be more upright to focus radiation onto a boiler that 
was 50 percent larger. </p>

<p>Finally satisfied with the results, he 
decided to advertise his design by exhibiting it in sunny Pasadena, 
Calif., at Edwin Cawston's ostrich farm, a popular tourist attraction. 
The monstrous machine did not fail to attract attention. Its reflector, 
which spanned 33 feet in diameter, contained 1,788 individual mirrors. 
And its boiler, which was about 13 feet in length and a foot wide, held 
100 gallons of water. After exposure to the sun, Eneas's device boiled the 
water and transferred steam through a flexible pipe to an engine that pumped 
1,400 gallons of water per minute from a well onto the arid California 
landscape. </p>

<p>Not everyone grasped the concept. In fact, one man thought the solar machine 
had something to do with the 
incubation of ostrich eggs. But Eneas's marketing savvy eventually paid 
off. Despite the occasional misconceptions, thousands who visited the 
farm left convinced that the sun machine would soon be a fixture in the sunny 
Southwest. Moreover, many regional newspapers and popular-science journals sent 
reporters to the farm to cover the spectacle. To Frank Millard, a reporter for 
the brand new magazine World's Work, the potential of solar motors placed in 
quantity across the land inspired futuristic visions of a region "where oranges 
may be growing, lemons yellowing, and grapes purpling, under the glare of the 
sun which, while it ripens the fruits it will also water and nourish them." He 
also predicted that the potential for this novel machine was not limited to 
irrigation: "If the sun motor will pump water, it will also grind grain and 
saw lumber and run electric cars." </p>

<p>The future, like the machine itself, looked bright and shiny. In 1903 Eneas, 
ready to market his solar motor, moved his Boston-based company to Los Angeles, 
closer to potential customers. By early the following year he had sold his 
first complete system for $2,160 to Dr. A. J. Chandler of Mesa, Ariz. 
Unfortunately,after less than a week, the rigging supporting the heavy boiler 
weakened during a windstorm and collapsed, sending it tumbling into the 
reflector and damaging the machine beyond repair. <p>
But Eneas, accustomed 
to setbacks, decided to push onward and constructed another solar pump near 
Tempe, Ariz. Seven long months later, in the fall of 1904, John May, a rancher 
in Wilcox, Ariz., bought another machine for $2,500. Unfortunately, shortly 
afterward, it was destroyed by a hailstorm. This second weather-related 
incident all but proved that the massive parabolic reflector was too 
susceptible to the turbulent climactic conditions of the desert southwest. 
And unable to survive on such measly sales, the company soon folded. </p>


<p>Though the machine did not become a fixture as Eneas had hoped, the 
inventor contributed a great deal of scientific and technical data about 
solar heat conversion and initiated more than his share of public exposure. 
Despite his business failure, the lure of limitless fuel was strong, and 
while Eneas and the Solar Motor Company were suspending their operations, 
another solar pioneer was just beginning his. </p>

<h3>
Moonlight Operation
</h3>

<p>Henry E. Willsie began his solar motor construction a year before 
Eneas's company folded. In his opinion, the lessons of Mouchout, Adams, 
Ericsson, and Eneas proved the cost inefficiency of high-temperature, 
concentrating machines. He was convinced that a nonreflective, 
lower-temperature collection system similar to Tellier's invention was 
the best method for directly utilizing solar heat. The inventor also felt 
that a solar motor would never be practical unless it could operate 
around the clock. Thus thermal storage, a practice that lent itself to 
low-temperature operation, was the focus of his experimentation. </p>

<p>To store the sun's energy, Willsie built large flat-plate collectors 
that heated hundreds of gallons of water, which he kept warm all night 
in a huge insulated basin. He then submerged a series of tubes, or 
vaporizing pipes, inside the basin to serve as boilers. When the acting 
medium--Willsie preferred sulfur dioxide to Tellier's ammonia--passed 
through the pipes, it transformed into a high-pressure vapor, which passed 
to the engine, operated it, and exhausted into a condensing tube, where it 
cooled, returned to a liquid state, and was reused. </p>

<p>In 1904, confident that his design would produce continuous power, 
he built two plants, a 6-horsepower facility in St. Louis, Mo., and a 
15-horsepower operation in Needles, Calif. And after several power trials, 
Willsie decided to test the storage capacity of the larger system. After 
darkness had fallen, he opened a valve that "allowed the solar-heated water 
to flow over the exchanger pipes and thus start up the engine." Willsie had 
created the first solar device that could operate at night using the heat 
gathered during the day. He also announced that the 15-horsepower machine 
was the most powerful arrangement constructed up to that time. Beside 
offering a way to provide continuous solar power production, Willsie also 
furnished detailed cost comparisons to justify his efforts: the solar plant 
exacted a two-year payback period, he claimed, an exceptional value even 
when compared with today's standards for alternative energy technology. </p>

<p>Originally, like Ericsson and Eneas before him, Willsie planned to 
market his device for desert irrigation. But in his later patents Willsie 
wrote that the invention was "designed for furnishing power for electric 
light and power, refrigerating and ice making, for milling and pumping at 
mines, and for other purposes where large amounts of power are required."</p>

<p>Willsie determined all that was left to do was to offer his futurist 
invention for sale. Unfortunately, no buyers emerged. Despite the favorable 
long-term cost analysis, potential customers were suspicious of the 
machine's durability, deterred by the high ratio of machine size to power 
output, and fearful of the initial investment cost of Willsie's ingenious 
solar power plant. His company, like others before it, disintegrated.</p>

<h3>A Certain Technical Maturity</h3>

<p>Despite solar power's dismal commercial failures, some proponents 
continued to believe that if they could only find the right combination of 
solar technologies, the vision of a free and unlimited power source would 
come true. Frank Shuman was one who shared that dream. But unlike most 
dreamers, Shuman did not have his head in the clouds. In fact, his hardheaded 
approach to business and his persistent search for practical solar power led him 
and his colleagues to construct the largest and most cost-effective machine 
prior to the space age.</p>

<p>Shuman's first effort in 1906 was similar to 
Willsie's flat-plate collector design except that it employed ether as a working 
fluid instead of sulfur dioxide. The machine performed poorly, however, because 
even at respectable pressures, the steam--or more accurately, the vapor--exerted 
comparatively little force to drive a motor because of its low specific gravity. </p>

<p>Shuman knew he needed more heat to produce steam, but felt that using 
complicated reflectors and tracking devices would be too costly and prone to 
mechanical failure. He decided that rather than trying to generate more heat, 
the answer was to better conserve the heat already being absorbed. </p>

<p>In 1910, to improve the collector's insulation properties, Shuman enclosed 
the absorption plates not with a single sheet of glass but with dual panes 
separated by a one-inch air space. He also replaced the boiler pipes with 
a thin, flat metal container similar to Tellier's original greenhouse design. 
The apparatus could now consistently boil water rather than ether. 
Unfortunately, however, the pressure was still insufficient to drive 
industrial-size steam engines, which were designed to operate under 
pressures produced by hotter-burning coal or wood. </p>


<p>After determining that the cost of building a larger absorber would be 
prohibitive, Shuman reluctantly conceded that the additional heat would 
have to be provided through some form of concentration. He thus devised a 
low-cost reflector stringing together two rows of ordinary mirrors to 
double the amount of radiation intercepted. And in 1911, after forming 
the Sun Power Co., he constructed the largest solar conversion system 
ever built. In fact, the new plant, located near his home in Talcony, 
Penn., intercepted more than 10,000 square feet of solar radiation. 
The new arrangement increased the amount of steam produced, but still 
did not provide the pressure he expected. </p>

<p>Not easily defeated, Shuman figured that if he couldn't raise the 
pressure of the steam to run a conventional steam engine, he would 
have to redesign the engine to operate at lower pressures. So he 
teamed up with E.P. Haines, an engineer who suggested that more precise 
milling, closer tolerances in the moving components, and lighter-weight 
materials would do the trick. Haines was right. When the reworked 
engine was connected to the solar collectors, it developed 33 horsepower 
and drove a water pump that gushed 3,000 gallons per minute onto the 
Talcony soil. </p>

<p><img src = "Smith1.GIF"></p>

<p>Shuman calculated that the Talcony plant cost $200 per horsepower 
compared with the $80 of a conventionally operated coal system--a 
respectable figure, he pointed out, considering that the additional 
investment would be recouped in a few years because the fuel was free. 
Moreover, the fact that this figure was not initially competitive with 
coal or oil-fired engines in the industrial Northeast did not concern 
him because, like the French entrepreneurs before him, he was planning 
to ship the machine to the vast sunburnt regions in North Africa.</p>


<p>To buy property and move the machine there, new investors were 
solicited from England and the Sun Power Co. Ltd. was created. But 
with the additional financial support came stipulations. Shuman was 
required to let British physicist C. V. Boys review the workings of 
the machine and suggest possible improvements. In fact, the physicist 
recommended a radical change. Instead of flat mirrors reflecting the 
sun onto a flat-plate configuration, Boys thought that a parabolic 
trough focusing on a glass-encased tube would perform much better. 
Shuman's technical consultant A.S.E. Ackermann agreed, but added that 
to be effective, the trough would need to track the sun continuously. 
Shuman felt that his conception of a simple system was rapidly 
disintegrating. </p>


<p>Fortunately, when the machine was completed just outside of Cairo, 
Egypt, in 1912, Shuman's fears that the increased complexity would 
render the device impractical proved unfounded. The Cairo plant 
outperformed the Talcony model by a large margin--the machine produced 
33 percent more steam and generated more than 55 horsepower--which more 
than offset the higher costs. Sun Power Co.'s solar pumping station 
offered an excellent value of $150 per horsepower, significantly reducing 
the payback period for solar-driven irrigation in the region. It looked 
as if solar mechanical power had finally developed the technical 
sophistication it needed to compete with coal and oil.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, the beginning was also the end. Two months after the 
final Cairo trials, Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in the Balkans, 
igniting the Great War. The fighting quickly spread to Europe's colonial 
holdings, and the upper regions of Africa were soon engulfed. Shuman's 
solar irrigation plant was destroyed, the engineers associated with the 
project returned to their respective countries to perform war-related 
tasks, and Frank Shuman died before the armistice was signed. </p>


<p>Whether or not Shuman's device would have initiated the commercial 
success that solar power desperately needed, we will never know. However, 
the Sun Power Co. can boast a certain technical maturity by effectively 
synthesizing the ideas of its predecessors from the previous 50 years. 
The company used an absorber (though in linear form) of Tellier and 
Willsie, a reflector similar to Ericsson's, simple tracking mechanisms 
first used by Mouchout and later employed by Eneas, and combined them 
to operate an engine specially designed to run with solar-generated 
steam. In effect, Shuman and his colleagues set the standard for many 
of the most popular modern solar systems 50 to 60 years before the fact.</p>

<h3>The Most Rational Source</h3>

<p>The aforementioned solar pioneers were only the most notable 
inventors involved in the development of solar thermal power from 1860 
to 1914. Many others contributed to the more than 50 patents and the 
scores of books and articles on the subject. With all this sophistication, 
why couldn't solar mechanical technology blossom into a viable industry? 
Why did the discipline take a 50-year dive before again gaining a measure 
of popular interest and technical attention? </p>

<p>First, despite the rapid advances in solar mechanical technology, the 
industry's future was rendered problematic by a revolution in the use and 
transport of fossil fuels. Oil and coal companies had established a massive 
infrastructure, stable markets, and ample supplies. Also, besides trying 
to perfect the technology, solar pioneers had the difficult task of convincing 
skeptics to see solar energy as something more than a curiosity. Visionary 
rhetoric without readily tangible results was not well received by a 
population accustomed to immediate gratification. Improving and adapting 
existing power technology, deemed less risky and more controlled, seemed to 
make far more sense. </p>


<p>Finally, the ability to implement radically new hardware requires 
either massive commitment or the failure of existing technology to get the 
job done. Solar mechanical power production in the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries did not meet either criterion. Despite warnings from 
noted scientists and engineers, alternatives to what seemed like an 
inexhaustible fuel supply did not fit into the U.S. agenda. Unfortunately, 
in many ways, these antiquated sentiments remain with us today. 
During 
the 1970s, while the OPEC nations exercised their economic power and as 
the environmental and "no-nuke" movements gained momentum, Americans plotted 
an industrial coup whose slogans were energy efficiency and renewable 
resources. Consequently, mechanical solar power--along with its 
space-age, electricity-producing sibling photovoltaics, as well as other 
renewable sources such as wind power--underwent a revival. And during 
the next two decades, solar engineers tried myriad techniques to satisfy 
society's need for power. </p>

<p>They discovered that dish-shaped reflectors akin to Mouchout's and 
Eneas's designs were the most efficient but also the most expensive and 
difficult to maintain. Low-temperature, nonconcentrating systems like 
Willsie's and Tellier's, though simple and less sensitive to climatic 
conditions, were among the least powerful and therefore suited only to 
small, specific tasks. Stationary reflectors like those used in Adams's 
device, now called Power Tower systems, offered a better solution but 
were still pricey and damage prone. </p>


<p>By the mid-1980s, contemporary solar engineers, like their 
industrial-revolution counterparts Ericsson and Shuman, determined that 
for sunny areas, tracking parabolic troughs were the best compromise 
because they exhibited superior cost-to-power ratios in most locations. 
Such efforts led engineers at the Los Angeles-based Luz Co. to construct 
an 80-megawatt electric power plant using parabolic trough collectors to 
drive steam-powered turbines. The company had already used similar 
designs to build nine other solar electric generation facilities, providing 
a total of 275 megawatts of power. In the process, Luz engineers steadily 
lowered the initial costs by optimizing construction techniques and taking 
advantage of economiesof buying material in bulk to build ever-larger 
plants until the price dropped from 24 to 12 cents per kilowatt hour. 
The next, even larger plant--a 300-megawatt facility--scheduled for 
completion last year, promised to provide 6 to 7 cents per kilowatt 
hour, near the price of electricity produced by coal, oil, or nuclear 
technology. </p>

<p>Once again, as with Shuman and his team, the gap was closing. But once 
again these facilities would not be built. Luz, producer of more than 95 
percent of the world's solar-based electricity, filed for bankruptcy in 
1991. According to Newton Becker, Luz's chairman of the board, and other 
investors, the demise of the already meager tax credits, declining fossil 
fuel prices, and the bleak prospects for future assistance from both federal 
and state governments drove investors to withdraw from the project. As 
Becker concluded, "The failure of the world's largest solar electric 
company was not due to technological or business judgment failures but 
rather to failures of government regulatory bodies to recognize the economic 
and environmental benefits of solar thermal generating plants." </p>


<p>Other solar projects met with similar financial failure. For example, 
two plants that employed the tower power concept, Edison's 10-megawatt 
plant in Daggett, Calif., and a 30-megawatt facility built in Jordan 
performed well despite operating on a much smaller scale and without 
Luz's advantages of heavy initial capital investment and a lengthy 
trial-and-error process to improve efficiency. Still they were assessed 
as too costly to compete in the intense conventional fuel market. </p>


<p>Although some of our brightest engineers have produced some exemplary 
solar power designs during the past 25 years, their work reflects a 
disjointed solar energy policy. Had the findings of the early solar 
pioneers and the evolution of their machinery been more closely 
scrutinized, perhaps by Department of Energy officials or some other 
oversight committee, contemporary efforts might have focused on building 
a new infrastructure when social and political attitudes were more 
receptive to solar technology. Rather than rediscovering the technical 
merits of the various systems, we might have been better served by 
reviewing history, selecting a relatively small number of promising 
systems, and combining them with contemporary materials and construction 
techniques. Reinventing the wheel when only the direction of the cart 
seems suspect is certainly not the best way to reach one's destination. </p>

<p>While the best period to make our energy transition may have passed 
and though our energy future appears stable, the problems that initiated 
the energy crisis of the 1970s have not disappeared. Indeed, the 
instability of OPEC and the recent success in the Gulf War merely 
created an artificial sense of security about petroleum supplies. 
While we should continue to develop clean, efficient petroleum and 
coal technology while our present supplies are plentiful, this approach 
should not dominate our efforts. 

Alternative, renewable energy technologies must eventually be implemented 
in tandem with their fossil-fuel counterparts. Not doing so would simply 
provide an excuse for maintaining the status quo and beg for economic 
disruption when reserves run low or political instability again erupts 
in oil-rich regions. </p>

<p>Toward that end, we must change the prevailing attitude that solar 
power is an infant field born out of the oil shocks and the environmental 
movement of the past 25 years. Such misconceptions lead many to assert 
that before solar power can become a viable alternative, the industry 
must first pay its dues with a fair share of technological evolution.</p>


<p>Solar technology already boasts a century of R&D, requires no toxic 
fuel and relativelylittle maintenance, is inexhaustible, and, with 
adequate financial support, is capable of becoming directly competitive 
with conventional technologies in many locations. These attributes make 
solar energy one of the most promising sources for many current and 
future energy needs. As Frank Shuman declared more than 80 years ago, 
it is "the most rational source of power." </p>
