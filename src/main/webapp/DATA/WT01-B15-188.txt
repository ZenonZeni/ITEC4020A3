<hr><p>
<body>The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 requires Federal
agencies, including the Department of Energy, to evaluate potential environmental
impacts when planning a major Federal action. In this way, public officials gain necessary
information to use in making informed decisions.
<p>
Another major emphasis of the Act is to promote public awareness at the earliest planning stages
and to provide opportunities for the public to provide input. The process is meant to be a
dialogue between the Federal government and the public.
<p>
<strong>NEPA, Start To Finish</strong>
<p>
The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, established the Council on Environmental
Quality which acts as a "watchdog" for the NEPA process. This organization is part of the
executive branch and has developed regulations that Federal agencies must follow when
developing an Environmental Impact Statement or EIS. Each Government agency, including
DOE, has developed specific regulations to comply with the Council's procedures.
<p>
Major Federal actions come in many varieties, for example, a rerouted interstate highway, a new
dam, or a ski resort expansion on Federally-owned land. If an action has been studied in the past
and does not have significant impact, or if it can be compared to an activity the law defines as not
having significant impact, it may be excluded and no further NEPA studies are necessary. The
agency can then implement its proposed action.
<p>
If the proposed action is not excluded from further study, the NEPA process continues. The next
step is to determine whether an action will have significant impacts on the environment. If the
answer is yes, NEPA outlines a detailed process for an EIS. If the answer is unknown, a less
detailed study, called an Environmental Assessment (EA), is prepared first, as an aid to decide on
further action.  An EA is a document that analyzes whether the action would significantly impact
the environment. The findings of an EA determine whether to prepare a more detailed
Environmental Impact Statement or issue a Finding of No Significant Impact.
<p>
Preparing the Environmental Impact Statement is a well-defined process in itself. First, a Notice
of Intent must be issued in the Federal Register to inform the public that a study will be done.
Then, in a process known as "scoping," the general public as well as Federal, State, and local
agencies and Indian tribes, are asked to give their comments and to better define the issues that
should be covered. Next, a draft Environmental Impact Statement is written. NEPA requires a
minimum 45-day period for public comment when the draft EIS is issued. Afterwards, the Federal
agency issues a final Environmental Impact Statement which responds to oral and written
comments received during the public review of the draft. The agency is now prepared to
make an informed decision and, after a 30-day waiting period, issues a Record of Decision. The
Federal agency may then begin implementation of its decision.
<p>
<strong>Focus Of An Environmental Impact Statement</strong>
<p>
After scoping and during the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement, experts examine
the potential impacts of the proposed action, as well as impacts from several reasonable
alternatives. The EIS identifies both positive and negative  effects and must consider all
interrelated elements of the environment -- not only the natural component (air, water, geology,
ecology) but the human component (jobs, housing, schools, health and safety, transportation,
cultural resources, noise, aesthetics). The study must also identify opportunities for reducing or
eliminating significant adverse impacts.
<p>
An EIS must also examine the impacts of not implementing the proposed action. This is called
the "no-action" alternative and may mean that the agency simply continues using existing
approaches.
<p>
The NEPA process does not dictate that an agency choose the most environmentally acceptable
or least expensive alternative. The purpose of the NEPA process is to ensure that necessary and
accurate studies are done, that they are done with public involvement, and that public officials,
like those at the Department of Energy, make decisions based on an understanding of
environmental and social consequences.
<p>
<strong>Public Involvement in the NEPA Process</strong>
<p>
Public input in the NEPA process is emphasized early on in the scoping phase and during public
comment periods; it strengthens the NEPA process. Concerns raised during public scoping help
shape the issues in the Environmental Impact Statement. Comments received from the public are
responded to and included in the final document. The Federal Register publishes Notices of
Intent for specific EISs, and in addition to area newspapers, will announce Public Scoping
Meetings or Public Hearings.
