<H3>National Alliance For The Mentally Ill And National Task Force Urge Federal Government To Find Housing For 1.8 Million Americans With Disabilities</H3>

<CENTER><I>Panel Charges Available Housing for People With Disabilities Will Drop 50 Percent
Due to New Law That Reserves Much Public and Assisted Housing for the Elderly
</I></CENTER><P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--Explaining that people with severe mental illness are facing a critical shortage in safe, affordable housing, NAMI in partnership with the national task force today called on the federal government to take steps to replace the housing lost to people with disabilities due to the creation of "elderly only" public and assisted housing.  Included in their recommendations are a more equitable share of existing housing resources as well as new resources for housing for people with disabilities.
<P>
The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Housing Task Force and the Boston-based Technical Assistance Collaborative project found that as many as 1.8 million people with disabilities may be in need of federally subsidized housing.  This includes people with mental retardation, mental illness, cerebral palsy, and a variety of other physical and mental disabilities.  NAMI Public Policy Director Andrew Sperling serves as a co-chair of the CCD Housing Task Force.
<P>
As the number of people with disabilities grows, the number of available housing units is shrinking, according to the task force report.  As a result, the housing shortage is limiting the ability of people with disabilities to lead full and independent lives within their own communities.  Without access to affordable housing in the community, they face institutionalization or homelessness.
<P>
In <I><A HREF="#open">Opening Doors:  Recommendations For A Federal Policy To Address The Housing Needs of People With Disabilities</A></I>, NAMI and the task force warn that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has significantly underestimated the number of people with disabilities who have priority housing needs.  After carrying out an in-depth analysis of available data, the task force found that the number of people with disabilities receiving Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) benefits who may have acute housing problems is 1.8 million, 10 times higher than HUD estimates.  The tasks force number does not include the many people with disabilities who have income other than SSI but still may be eligible for HUD assistance.
<P>
The CCD Housing Task Force, which has been working on this issue of housing loss for five years, is co-chair by representatives of the American Network of Community Options and Resources, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and the ARC.  Among the task force member groups are the National Easter Seals Society, United Cerebral Palsy Association, National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils, Brain Injury Association, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and others.  Together these organizations represent millions of people with a variety of disabilities nationwide.
<P>
One of the single most important factors in the reduction in housing for people with disabilities was the 1992 decision by Congress to allow "elderly only" subsidized housing.  That legislation permitted both Public Housing Authorities and HUD-assisted housing providers to limit or exclude people with disabilities from living in certain subsidized housing developments by designating that housing as "elderly only."  This problem was exacerbated by legislation passed this year which makes it easier for public housing authorities to designate housing.
<P>
The task force has now been able to quantify the impact of this "elderly only" policy enacted by Congress in 1992 and 1996.
<P>
Because of this policy, the supply of public and assisted housing units that was previously occupied by people with disabilities will shrink by at least 50 percent.  Based on estimates of the number of people with disabilities who will be displaced from subsidized housing and waiting lists, there will be a decrease of at least 273,000 units that would have otherwise been occupied by people with disabilities.
<P>
"People with severe mental illness are losing their housing, and with that they are losing the opportunity to live full and productive lives in the community," said Andrew Sperling of NAMI, co-chairman of the task force.  "We are not suggesting that the federal government stop subsidizing housing for the elderly.  However, they cannot shift 273,000 homes away from people with disabilities to the elderly and just ignore the impact that this has on the lives of people with disabilities.  Congress must replace the available housing units and subsidies that would have been open to people with disabilities under age 62."
<P>
In addition to the "elderly only" housing designation, a myriad of factors have contributed to the shortage of affordable housing for people with disabilities.  The task force cited:
<P>
<UL>
	
<LI>the stigma and discrimination faced by people with disabilities, particularly people with severe and persistent mental illness;
<P>
<LI>the absence of clear mandates within federal housing programs and policies to expand the supply of federally funded housing for people with disabilities; and
<P>
<LI>underfunding of federal tenant-based rental assistance programs</UL>
<P>
Without a clearly articulated housing policy and new monies to address the loss of available housing to people with disabilities, their already acute housing problems will increase.  Using very conservative turnover rates, the task force estimates that by the year 2000:
<P><UL>
<LI>more than 100,000 units occupied by people with disabilities will convert to "elderly only" units;
<P>
<LI>more than 160,000 people with disabilities on waiting lists who would have otherwise been offered a subsidized housing unit will be told that they are no longer eligible to move in; and
<P>
<LI>an unknown number of people with disabilities who would have applied for admission to federally subsidized housing will have no other affordable housing options available.
</UL>
<P>
The major question is:  Where will people with disabilities, many of who have been on subsidized housing waiting lists for years, find alternative housing resources?  What about people with disabilities who were previously eligible to apply for this housing who will now be turned away?  What about people with disabilities living in institutions who should be living in the community?
<P>
In the Opening Doors report, the task force states that "people with disabilities are entitled to an equitable share of federal housing resources, even in an era of federal fiscal constraints."  To address the increasing affordable housing crisis, the task force recommends that the federal government take the following actions:
<P><UL>
<LI>authorize and appropriate funds for 75,000 new Section 8 tenant-based subsidies for people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>redirect the federal law to require that one out of every three Section 8 turnover subsidies be issued to a person with a disability under age 62;
<P>
<LI>redirect at least 50 percent of current Section 202 funding, which designates affordable housing for the elderly, to set aside rental assistance for communities experiencing the greatest negative impact of designated housing policies on available housing for people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>promote the expansion of affordable housing for people with disabilities by creating "thresholds" in the Community Development Block Grant and HOME-formula grant programs.  The HOME program is designed to help states, local governments, and Indian tribes to implement local housing strategies for low- and very low-income Americans;
<P>
<LI>reauthorize the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program to expand the supply of affordable housing that can be accessed by people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>create home-ownership demonstrations that target low-income people with disabilities who are typically not included in federally funded home ownership initiatives;
<P>
<LI>create incentives for public housing authorities to maintain "mixed" housing; and
<P>
<LI>expand the Fair Housing Initiative Program to specifically include monitoring of the implementation of designated housing policies.</UL.>
<P>
NAMI, a non-profit organization representing 140,000 people with serious brain disorders and their families, has been leading a grassroots campaign to end discrimination against severe mental illness.  NAMI's 1,400 chapters are active at the state and local levels in all 50 states.
<P>
The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities is a Washington-based coalition of national consumer, advocacy, provider, and professional organizations that advocate on behalf of people of all ages with disabilities and their families.  CCD created the Housing Task Force to focus specifically on housing issues that affect people with disabilities.
<P>
The Technical Assistance Collaborative Inc. is a non-profit organization that provides state-of-the-art information, knowledge, and technical expertise to health, housing, and human service organizations so that they may achieve positive outcomes in their work on behalf of people who are disadvantaged and/or have disabilities.
