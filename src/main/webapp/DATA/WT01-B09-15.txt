<BLOCKQUOTE>
 California — While propane-powered vehicles still hold the lead in counts of California’s alternative-fueled vehicles, some in the field say the state’s tough emissions rules are killing the propane conversion industry, reports Oxy-Fuel News. There are currently 45,000 propane-fueled vehicles in California, but the numbers are misleading, advocates say; almost all were in operation before the California Air Resources Board (CARB) tightened its rules in 1992. Conversion kit-makers are now required to pay CARB more than $200,000 per "engine family type" and submit vehicles to 100,000-mile durability tests, which may take as long as six months to complete. Because of various engine configurations, converters can spend millions of dollars to certify one engine size, said Bruce Eikelberger of Alternate Fuel Technology, a conversion company. CARB spokesman Alan Hearst said CARB’s goal is cleaner air; it should be up to the industry to find a way to make their kits meet the standards.
