<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

	<P>CALSTART designed and developed its first generation DAS in 1993 and installed it on a number of heavy electric vehicles.  These systems were designed to use a computer to collect and synthesize data recovered from distributed monitoring points.  While quite robust and capable of handling significant volumes of data, the first generation DAS was larger and more costly than acceptable for the general EV/HEV market.</P>

<P>The CALSTART Data Acquisition System (CDAS) is currently being redesigned as a low cost, on-board data acquisition for EVs and HEVs.  This second generation system will allow users to evaluate the performance of their EVs and HEVs by monitoring all of the various systems, subsystems and components on the vehicle.  CALSTART's first generation system allows the capability to monitor up to 64 differential signals and 64 single-ended signals.  CALSTART is now working on a new version of this system which will be able to monitor the above signals as well as up to 256 individual batteries.  During charging, the CDAS will also allow for limited battery equalization.  CALSTART's second generation DAS will be based on a PC Card hard drive for data storage, which has a much smaller profile than the current hard drive being used.  As a result, power consumption for the new design has been significantly reduced and operator inputs have been virtually eliminated.  CALSTART also has plans to incorporate the use of a radio-frequency (RF) unit for the battery monitoring system.</P>
	
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>A prototype is expected in May of 1996, with installation in a variety of EVs and HEVs in 1996.  Full commercialization is planned by late 1996.</P>
