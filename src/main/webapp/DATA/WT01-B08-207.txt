            <BR><P><img src="stripe.gif"></center><p> </font> <font size=4></CENTER><A NAME="index"></A><A NAME="index2"></A><font size=3><b> WASHINGTON  -- The Commerce Department today imposed an $18,000 civil penalty on Aurora Pump,  a North Aurora, Illinois, manufacturer of industrial and commercial pumps for alleged violations of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act and Regulations, Frank Deliberti,  acting assistant secretary for Export Enforcement, announced.<p>

     The Department alleged that in late 1992, Aurora Pump violated the antiboycott provisions on one occasion by agreeing to furnish  a statement that a ship carrying goods to Kuwait "is not on the Israel Boycott Bureau black list."  The Department further alleged that on six separate occasions during 1992 and 1993 Aurora Pump failed to report to the Department its receipt of boycott-related requests.<p>


     While neither admitting nor denying the alleged antiboycott violations, Aurora Pump agreed to pay the civil penalty to settle the case.<p>


     The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act and Regulations apply to foreign boycotts fostered or imposed against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. <p>


     The antiboycott provisions prohibit United States individuals and companies from furnishing, or agreeing to furnish, information about any person's business relationships with or in a boycotted country, or with individuals and companies believed to be restricted from doing business with or in one or more countries that participate in the Arab boycott of Israel.  U.S. companies and individuals are also required to report to the Department each boycott-related request they receive.<p>
