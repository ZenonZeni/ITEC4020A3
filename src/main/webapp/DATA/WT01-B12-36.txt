 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTEIN ASSURANCE </H2>

<P>  PRO-MAX is a highly nutritious supplement that provides the daily requirements of protein for lasting energy while at the same time supplying complex carbohydrates for more immediate energy.  Because of the combination of both high quality protein and high quality complex carbohydrate, PRO-MAX is particularly suitable for use by athletes and those with high energy expenditure requirements.  PRO-MAX, especially when taken with <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TMV-49</A>, is also suitable as a meal replacement for individuals on calorie restricted diets. It is  ideal  for  adding  to  milk, juices  or  other  foods, fortifying them with protein and complex carbohydrate. At the same time, it is relatively fat free and ensures adequate levels of high quality protein while minimizing fat intake. Because PRO-MAX is so easily digested, it is also excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of both children and elderly individuals who have a tendency to not eat as they should.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SOY & DAIRY FREE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX is an unusual blend of natural plant source protein and complex carbohydrate that is both dairy and soy free.  The high quality protein in PRO-MAX is obtained from natural Legume concentrates (Pisum Sativum) vegetable sources.  It can be used freely by those individuals who have dairy and/or soy allergies. Plus, it is much better tasting than soy-based products.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX IS SPECIAL</H2>
<P>  Life Plus developed PRO-MAX to represent the state-of-the-art in protein supplements. We chose not to use any soy, milk or hydrolyzed protein. We were able to identify an excellent source of high quality vegetable protein, extracted for us from certain yellow peas under carefully controlled and monitored conditions.   It contains a high percentage of essential amino acids.</P>
 <P>  All proteins are not created equal. Different proteins contain various amounts of essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are those that the body cannot manufacture itself so they must be contained in the diet. PRO-MAX, with its high percentage of essential amino acids, is a leading product in its category. The P.E.R. or Protein Efficiency Ratio is a number that describes the quality of proteins. PRO-MAX has a very high P.E.R. of 2.7. Actually, PRO-MAX can supply the body's entire need for protein if enough were taken.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX also contains complex carbohydrates, those  that  scientists  refer  to  asamylaceous polysaccharides, from specially grown barley processed in such a way as to protect its other beneficial natural ingredients.  The inclusion of thirty percent complex carbohydrate in this great product is consistent with current research. This research demonstrates that excess protein on its own may have adverse effects, especially in the case of persons who have any tendency towards hypoglycemia.  The benefits of protein/carbohydrate combinations are becoming well established.   In addition, PRO-MAX contains good, soluble dietary fiber and provides substantial quantities of natural vitamins and minerals from the specially grown barley.</P>
<P>  PRO-MAX is pleasantly palatable. It has a pleasant, somewhat bland taste which is superior to other protein powders. Therefore, PRO-MAX is the finest and most versatile protein supplement in both palatability and composition. It is useful for fast energy and for building up energy reserves for people of all ages.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PRO-MAX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE PRO-MAX</H2>
 <P> PRO-MAX is intended to be used in the form of a drink, although it can be used as an ingredient, which can be added to flour, baked goods and other cooked products. It can also be added to prepared foods such as dips, soups, sauces and gravies. For those wishing to gain weight we recommend that it be taken in the form of a shake at meal times in addition to your regular food. In the  case  of  athletes,  take  in  water  or juice approximately one hour before exercise.  As a meal replacement, use two or three heaping tablespoonfuls in skim milk or your favorite juice in place of the meal.</P>



 
<P>
Suggested Use:  Mix two to four heaping tablespoons in liquid as a high energy quality protein drink . It 
can be used between meals or before or after exercise.</P>
