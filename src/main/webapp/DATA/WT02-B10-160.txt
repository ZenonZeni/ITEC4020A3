The Department of Postgraduate Psychiatric Education directs residency training in the core program at Psychiatric Institute (PI) and Presbyterian Hospital (PH), training for affiliated residency programs at Creedmoor and Middletown, research training in clinical research, and the Fellowship in Public Psychiatry. It also directs the weekly Grand Rounds at Psychiatric Institute, and oversees the use of the audio-visual resources of the Educational Research Laboratory. Reports from the component sections of the department follow.

<B>Residency Training-the Core Program</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are now 49 psychiatric residents in the adult psychiatry program. Eleven PGY I's, 14 PGY II's, 13 PGY III's, and 11 PGY IV's. Two adult psychiatry residents entered the Child Psychiatry Fellowship upon completing their PGY III year, one resident as part of the five- year Child and Adult Psychiatry Program, and the other as a Child Psychiatry Fellow. In June 1993, 14 psychiatric residents graduated from the Adult Psychiatry Program. Ten graduates remain affiliated with the department in some capacity. Their careers continue to reflect the diversity of departmental activities and of the educational program: two entered research fellowships at PI, two entered Public Psychiatry Fellowships at PI, two continued in the joint Child and Adult Psychiatry Program at PI, one entered the Consultation-Liaison Fellowship at PH, and three took clinical positions-one at PI and two at PH. Two of the above graduates also became candidates at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. Four residents left the Institute: one for a clinical/research position at Mt. Sinai Medical Center, one for a research position at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, one for a clinical position at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, and one for a child psychiatry fellowship at Brown University.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although recruitment into psychiatry has fallen, the residency continues to attract the highest quality medical students. With more than ten times the number of applicants than available positions, the department has been able to be very selective in its recruitment process. The residents who began their PGY I year in July 1994 continue to represent a cross-section of interests and achievement from research to clinical perspectives and reflect an increase in the recruitment of Asian residents. The credit for this success in attracting excellent applicants goes to the faculty, the educational program, and the exceptional reputation of the department.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The residents who began the five-year Child and Adult Psychiatry Program in 1991 entered the child psychiatry portion as PGY IV's in July 1994. Two PGY III's, one PGY II, and two PGY I's are in this track. The participants in this combined track continue to be enthusiastic. Beginning in July 1994, a new research track was offered to four residents. This track includes a PGY I rotation at the Creedmoor Schizophrenia Research Unit, a PGY II rotation on the PI 7 clinical research unit, and devoted time for research in the PGY III and IV years. This track was highly successful in recruiting excellent residents interested in research beginning in 1994. Even more applicants applied for this track in 1994 to begin training in 1995.

<B>Program in Clinical Research Training</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Four fellows completed training in clinical research in June 1994. Two have remained at Columbia, the other two at Cornell. In July, 13 fellows began or continued in programs supported by this department. The eight in the NIMH Fellowship in Affective, Anxiety, and Related Disorders were distributed as follows: one in anxiety disorders and seven in affective disorders. Five are pursuing schizophrenia research training. Even with the many positions available for research training, other excellent applicants are turned away. The department received an excellent score on its application for continued NIMH support of both the Fellowship in Affective, Anxiety, and Related Disorders and the Fellowship in Schizophrenia Research.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Fellowship Program in Public Psychiatry</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Public Psychiatry Fellowship Training Program continues to attract an increasing quality of Fellows. The program is now acknowledged to be the premier fellowship of its type in the country, receiving applicants in the past few years from Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and New Mexico. The 1994-95 class consists of nine fellows, including one Mead-Johnson Fellow, four chief residents, and two residents each from Psychiatric Institute and Payne Whitney. This year three Fellows are working in non-traditional community service agencies-Housing Works, the Association to Benefit Children, and Hamilton-Madison House. Two Fellows are involved in supportive residential services at St. Luke's/Roosevelt and Middletown Psychiatric Center. One Fellow is at the Washington Heights Community Service, and one is at St. Vincent's Hospital. Of special interest is a collaboration with the Bisexual, Lesbian, and Gay Fellowship at Bellevue Hospital, involving two Fellows, one as coordinator of that program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most recent survey of alumni (June 1994) confirms continued success in placing and retaining graduates in key roles in the public sector. Ninety-two percent are working actively in publicly-funded services, and over 55% have management positions. As evidence of the high academic standing of our graduates, 83% hold academic appointments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Public Psychiatry Fellowship is completing the final year of a three-year SAMHSA training grant paying partial support for one Fellow each year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Ranz, Director of the Public Psychiatry Fellowship Program, is President (1995-96) of the New York Regional Chapter of the American Association of Psychiatric Administrators.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most important event for the Fellowship this year was the recruitment of Dr. Sara Kellermann as a member of the Fellowship faculty. Dr. Kellermann's special perspective, gained from her experience as New York City Department of Mental Health Commissioner from 1980-90, has added greatly to the quality of seminar discussions. Other additions to the voluntary faculty include Drs. Lew Opler, Paula Panzer, and Ruth Graver. The latter two are the first graduates of the program to become members of the Fellowship faculty.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Creedmoor and Middletown Residency Programs</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Columbia-Creedmoor Residency Training Program continued to expand it's programs. Currently there are 17 psychiatric residents in the program: three PGY-I's, four PGY-II's, five PGY-III's, four PGY-IV's, and one PGY-V chief resident. The Columbia portion of the curriculum provides comprehensive training in psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. There are also extensive clinical rotations at CPMC. The continued development of the Schizophrenia Research Unit Staff at Creedmoor has also benefitted the residency program. These changes have had clear effects on residents' performance and recruitment. For four years, Creedmoor has been a site for third-year Columbia medical student rotations in psychiatry. The development of the rotation is further evidence of Columbia's confidence in the level of training and clinical experience available at Creedmoor. In addition, Presbyterian Hospital has over recent years hired several Creedmoor residency graduates. Currently 20 Creedmoor staff hold Columbia faculty positions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Columbia-Middletown Residency Training Program provides approximately 200 classroom hours for an average of seven Middletown Hospital residents and ancillary personnel. The curriculum is varied and utilizes the efforts of 40 different faculty members. The staff provides broad exposure to the biological and clinical sciences. The students have been dedicated, reliable, and highly complimentary about the program.
