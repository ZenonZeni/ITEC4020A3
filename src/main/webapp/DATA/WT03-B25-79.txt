Clean Air Act Compliance <BR>
for Chromium Emissions <BR>
from Electrolytic Processes
</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hard chromium, decorative chromium and chromium anodizing tanks 
are regulated. Rinse, etch, chromate conversion tanks, lab and R&amp;D facilities are exempt from regulations...</B>
</CENTER>

<P>The U.S. EPA and the University of Tennessee provided funding for a 
teleconference on the issue of chromium emissions and federal regulations. 
The American Electro-platers and Surface Finishers Society (AESF), 
National Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF) and Metal Finishing 
Suppliers' Association (MFSA), along with the Tennessee Department of 
Environment and Conservation's Small Business Assistance Program developed the 
conference that was telecast across the country. 
<P>The conference covered the Clean Air Act Sections one through 
seven, Title V permits and HAPs. Panelists in Part I include Frank Altmayer 
of Scientific Control Labs, Don Moroni, an environmental specialist with 
the Tennessee Small Business Association and Dr. Ken Newby of Atotech. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What can be done to meet the regulations? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: The rule says any method that meets the emissions standard 
is permissible. It spells out specifically add-on devices: Packed-bed 
scrubbers, fume suppressants or foam blankets. Decorative platers also have the 
option of trivalent chromium baths, which are controlled only by reporting 
their existence. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: Is a Title V Permit required for chromium emissions? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: Regulations, as they exist today, do require a Title 
V permit for all emission sources, even trivalent chromium sources. The 
industry, through its Director of Government Relations, Bill Sonntag, has 
negotiated with EPA to have a five-year deferral put into the Federal Register. If 
the five-year deferral is granted, the emission sources do not have to apply 
for five years. <I>(EPA has granted the five-year deferral on Title V permits -- Editor)</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What emission standard must be met under the new 
rule for decorative chromium and chromium anodize tanks? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: There are two options. First, finishers can use a 
fume suppressant and reduce the surface tension of the processing solution 
below 45 dynes/cm. If successful, they no longer need to do any emission 
testing and have no emission standards to comply with. 
<P>If they do not use fume suppressants, and choose to use an 
emission control device, the standard is 0.01mg/dscm of air for decorative 
chromium platers and chromium anodizers. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What about hard chromium plating? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: Hard chromium plating falls into three categories. 
There are new sources. Existing sources are those that were in existence prior 
to December 16, 1993, and these are divided into small and large. The 
new sources, no matter their size, and the large existing sources must meet 
a standard of 0.015 mg of total hexavalent chromium per dscm. Small 
sources must meet 0.03 mg/dscm. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What about trivalent chromium emission standards? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: Trivalent chromium decorative platers merely need to tell 
the state that they are using this chemical, and they must use a fume 
suppressant or wetting agent. All commercial baths meet this requirement. Users 
must keep track of chemical purchases. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: How does a decorative plater using this technology 
demonstrate compliance? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: For finishers using fume suppressants, they will have to 
measure surface tension. The most common methods are a stalagmometer 
and tensiometer. Using either, a finisher has to demonstrate that the 
surface tension of the tank is 45 dynes/cm or lower. The finisher needs to do 
this initially every four hrs. If he shows compliance over a period of time, this 
can be extended to every 40 hrs of tank use.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: Are there advantages to using EPA-prescribed methods? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Moroni: The regulations do not specify that these methods be 
used; however, if a finisher chose to use an alternative method, proof of compliance 
is the finisher's responsibility. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: In the regulations, what qualifies a hard chromium 
facility as either small or large? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: To determine whether a facility is large or small add up 
all the rectifier capacity for hard chromium plating and multiply the 
sum total by 8,400 operating hrs per year. This total is then multiplied by 0.7 
(utilization factor) to determine amp/hr/year capacity. If the value is greater than or equal 
to 60 million amp/hr/year, it is a large facility. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What kind of add-on technology does EPA regulate 
under the new regulations? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: EPA says finishers can use any control device. But 
it recognizes a packed bed scrubber for meeting the 0.3 mg/cu meter 
standard. For the 0.015 mg/cu meter standard, EPA recognizes advanced 
composite mesh pad systems as control devices. It also recognizes that a fiber-bed 
mist eliminator could be used to achieve the 0.015 standard or lower. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What about chemical fume suppressants? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: EPA allows any chemical fume suppressant that lowers 
surface tension to 45 dynes. It also allows a foam blanket of greater than 
one-inch high. This is more difficult to measure and maintain. You are not told 
where to measure, and the foam tends to be sucked up into the scrubber system.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: When must the new standards be achieved? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Moroni: For existing hard chromium electroplaters and anodizers 
the date is June 25, 1997. For existing decorative chromium platers the date 
is January 25, 1996. Any new or reconstructed source must achieve at the 
time of start-up. New sources started after December 16, 1993, and before 
January 25, 1995, must negotiate with their local air pollution control board. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: Is a control device needed for a large non-electrified 
chromium etch tank with chromium in it?</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Moroni: The regulations are very specific on that. This may be an 
etch tank used in plating on plastics, which usually has a lot more chromium in 
it; however, non-electrified tanks are exempt. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What is EPA's rationale in delaying Title V permits five years? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: We approached EPA from the standpoint that the 
requirements for a Title V permit assume that the discharger is a major source. 
A major source discharges more than 10,000 lb/yr of regulated material. 
These electroplating and anodizing operators emit small quantities. Under 
maximum conditions, it might be 10 lbs/yr. EPA decided to regulate these 
operations based on the hazardous nature of chromium, rather than the 10,000 
lb limit. We approached them from the standpoint that since we discharge 
small amounts, it would be unreasonable to require a Title V permit for 
operations such as decorative plating with trivalent and hexavalent chromium. This 
is an economic burden. EPA recognized and agreed with that and has 
decided to issue a five-year deferral. After five years EPA has promised that Title 
V permitting will be easier so hard chromium platers who still have to apply 
for Title V will have an easier time and spend less money doing it. 


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: If a company is using less than 60 million amps, yet 
has the capacity to use more, can it still be a small electroplater? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: The first thing the company could do is sign on to 
a federally enforceable limit on the rectifier capacity, but that means it 
would have to apply for a Title V permit, which it may not want to do. It may 
install amp/hr meters and use them to demonstrate that they are using less than 
60 million amp/yr, although they have the capacity to exceed that. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: The company I work for has been in business since 1950 and 
is grandfathered on any type of air permit. If it adds to current 
emission systems to come into compliance with new standards, will it need an 
air permit? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: If EPA files a five-year deferral, then on the basis of <BR>
the federal regulation you do not have to apply for a Title V Permit. 
However, there are local regulations. Check with local authorities. States are 
always allowed to be more strict and have more regulations. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: Do fume suppressants cause pitting on bright 
surfaces? Does this make fume suppressant use prohibitive? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: Modern fume suppressants do not cause pits. Old ones 
could result in particles in the bath that may have caused pitting. Pits usually 
result from poor base metal. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: Can meeting regulations be as easy as using a 
fume suppressant and fume blanket?</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: It is only that easy if you are a decorative plater or 
anodizer. Hard chromium platers have to use add-on devices. Most of the world 
uses fume suppressants for hard chromium plating. The U.S. EPA chose not to 
recognize it as one of the methods; therefore add-on devices will be necessary to 
meet regulations. 
<P><B>Mr. Altmayer: </B>As I understand the regulations, fume suppressants 
that lower the surface tension are as simple as that. But if you choose to use 
foam blankets, which do not lower surface tension stack tests must be done 
to prove that it meets the 0.01 mg/cu meter standard.
<P><B>Dr. Newby:</B> One of the functional problems with foam blankets is 
that when you get a thick layer of foam it entraps hydrogen. So there is 
the possibility of a hydrogen explosion. Also, the foam can be sucked into 
your ventilation system. Also, until you turn the current on, the foam blanket 
does not exist. So you do get fugitive emissions. Fume suppressants work 100 
pct of the time. 
<P>There are different fume suppressants. The old non-permanent type 
were non-fluorinated and inexpensive. You poured them in by the gallon. 
They broke down in the bath forming trivalent chromium and possibly 
particulates. Not too many people recommend their use, but the inexpensive price 
is attractive. 
<P>The permanent ones are fluorinated. Most of those on the market have a 
thin foam blanket when in use and control by lowering surface tension. 
<P>There are products out there that lower surface tension and have 
anti-foaming agents that remove foam blankets. This lowers the possibility 
of hydrogen explosions. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: We installed a comp mesh pad scrubber in 1994 and 
conducted emission testing about one month later. Is this enough to prove compliance 
or will testing have to be done again when the regulation goes into effect 
in January 1997? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Moroni: The initial performance only has to be done once, 
provided that you pass. It is important for anyone who does this that his 
control equipment be optimized. But testing is not done on a continuous basis. 
If you pass the first one, that is all that is required. 
<P><B>Dr. Newby: </B>One of the other requirements is that you have to notify 
your state or regulatory authority in advance of testing. There is a time 
period in which you have to make this notification. Possibly, if an individual ran a test 
and the state did not know, he may have to do some negotiating. 
<P><B>Mr. Altmayer: </B>It is also important that operating conditions under 
which the test is conducted remain the same. If the tank has been modified, 
if different current densities are used now than when the test was conducted, 
a new test is necessary. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What does EPA mean by the term reconstructed? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Moroni: Reconstructed, as defined by EPA in the general 
provisions of the regulations, is an expenditure of 50 pct or more of original 
capital costs of the equipment to overhaul or add to your existing system. This 
is reconstruction and considered a new source. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: Often MSDS indicate possible carcinogens in 
fume suppressants; therefore, there is some reluctance in using them. What 
is the advantage of chemical fume suppressants over poly balls? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: The advantage of chemical fume suppressants is that 
EPA recognizes them as a control means and they do not recognize poly 
balls. Poly balls have been a common thing, but they do not really cut down on 
the submicron particles that are the most difficult to control. 
<P><B>Mr. Altmayer: </B>The problem with this type of control is that you lose 
the balls in processing. They come out with parts and fall out of the tank.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What are some of the methods for testing emissions? 

</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Mr. Altmayer: There are three test methods for measuring 
emissions: Method 306, 306A and CARB (California Air Resources Board) 25, 
which was used as a basis for 306A. 306A is an isokinetic sampling technique 
that I would not recommend any plater attempt alone. You need a very 
expensive piece of equipment, and it is a complicated test. EPA recognized that 
this type of sampling can be expensive. Therefore, EPA came up with a 
simplified method using a sampling device that you can build yourself. This is 
method 306A. I would not say it is a simple technique. It is a laborious process 
that takes two people. You have to drill holes in the right spots in your 
ductwork. One person has to go up and do a traverse, which means taking samples 
at different points within the duct for specific amounts of time. Air samples 
are put through the scrubber system, and the scrubbant is analyzed by 
inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, graphite furnace or ion 
chromatography. The chromium is then quantified. You need two people for 
sampling and a well-equipped lab for the analysis. Typical tests for 306A may 
cost three to five thousand dollars. The isokinetic testing would be higher 
than that. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: What method would you use to measure surface 
tension, and would you describe the measuring instrument? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Newby: There are two methods. 306B uses a stalagmometer. It 
mounts to a piece of glassware that costs about $100. You pull solution up into 
the tube and count drops going out of a specified volume. The weight of 
each drop can be calculated from the total volume of the tube, the number of 
drops that fall and from the density for the sample. The problem with this 
is cleanliness and housekeeping. In order to get a good number, you have to 
do a lot of preparatory work. Also, the glassware tends to break easily, so 
you need one or two pieces. Measurements are made every four to 40 hrs, 
depending on whether or not the user is in compliance. 
<P>The other method is a tensiometer, where you have a ring that <BR>
you pull out of the solution and measure the force on it. This piece 
of equipment usually costs about two or three thousand dollars. However, it 
is quick and easy to use. For a plater with a large number of <BR>
tanks, this would not be an economic test method because of the 
labor commitment. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Moderator: Must you do anything else when testing emissions? </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Moderator: (answers the question) You must establish a range of 
controls or operational system parameters for the monitoring systems. Since you 
must maintain ongoing monitoring, the regulations specify system operating 
parameters needing control. But because each control method is different, 
no single control values have been set for these parameters. Site specific 
values are set for your system during testing. Specific parameters to be 
monitored and monitoring frequency are determined by your own emission 
control system.
