marijuana</b>. Journal of the International Hemp Association 1:
41-44.</p>

<p> Use of marijuana as a medicament is on the rise. Many medical
marijuana users have a suppressed immune system, owing to their
disease or treatment. Herbal marijuana, whether field grown or
hydroponically cultivated, contains many microorganisms. Many of
these organisms may pose a threat to immunosuppressed
individuals. The microflora of marijuana is well described in the
literature. Similarly, the microflora that cause opportunistic
infections in AIDS patients is well documented. These separate
literatures are correlated with commentary, and methods for
detecting and eliminating microbial contaminants are discussed. </p>

<hr size="1" noshade>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug &quot;having no
medical use, with a high potential for abuse&quot; by the US Drug
Enforcement Administration. Nevertheless, a handful of US
citizens are permitted use of government-supplied &quot;medical
marijuana&quot; for a variety of ailments (Bowersox 1992).
Additionally, a large clinical trial utilizing marijuana in AIDS
patients has been approved in San Francisco (Doblin 1994).</p>

<p> Doblin and Kleiman (1991) document the widespread illicit use
of marijuana for medical purposes. Nearly half of the oncologists
polled by Doblin and Kleiman recommended that their patients
experiment with marijuana as a medicine. Many of these patients,
however, are immuno-suppressed, making them very susceptible to
opportunistic bacteria and fungi. Since hundreds of bacteria and
fungi are associated with the cultivation of marijuana
(McPartland 1991), possible microbiological hazards need to be
assessed.</p>

<p> A majority of the organisms associated with marijuana are
strictly plant pathogens. They cannot infect healthy humans. But
a subset of opportunistic plant pathogens are associated with
&quot;post-harvest&quot; or &quot;storage&quot; decay of
marijuana. These organisms may infect immuno-compromised
individuals and become opportunistic human pathogens.
Additionally, many opportunist organisms on plants produce
dangerous toxins and/or elicit allergenic reactions when inhaled.</p>

<p> Lastly, a handful of strictly human pathogens have been
isolated from marijuana, as contaminants. These agents are highly
infectious, and some also exude toxins. </p>

<h2>AIDS and opportunistic infections</h2>

<p>People with AIDS are immunosuppressed, and very susceptible to
infections. According to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), the most
common infectious agents include viruses (cytomegalovirus,
hepatitis A &amp; B, herpes simplex), bacteria (<i>Mycobacterium</i>
spp., <i>Salmonella</i> spp.), fungi (<i>Cryptococcus neoformans,
Coccidiodies immitis, Histoplasma capsu-atum, Candida</i> spp.),
and protozoans (<i>Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii,
Cryptosporidium</i> sp.).</p>

<p> Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990) also describe rare infections in
AIDS patients caused by opportunistic fungi &#151; <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus, Penicillium marneffei, Fusarium proliferatum,
Alternaria alternata, Mucor</i> sp., <i>Rhizopus</i> sp., <i>Curvularia</i>
sp., and <i>Bipolaris</i> sp.</p>

<p> Most of these organisms infect people <i>via</i> the
respiratory tract, or by oral-mucosal contact with contaminated
material. Inhaling a marijuana cigarette contaminated with any of
these organisms poses a risk. </p>

<h2>Microflora of marijuana</h2>

<h3>Viruses and protozoans</h3>

<p>Cates &amp; Warren (1975) associated marijuana use with an
epidemic of hepatitis B in Germany, but did not isolate the virus
from plant material. An outbreak of Hepatitis A in Washington
state was linked to consumption of Mexican marijuana, fertilized
with human excrement (Alexander 1987). No protozoans are reported
from marijuana in the literature. </p>

<h3>Bacteria</h3>

<p>Several bacteria species cited as present on marijuana are
human pathogens, and produce toxins: Taylor <i>et al.</i> (1982)
isolated <i>Salmonella muenchen </i>from illicit marijuana.
Ungerlerder <i>et al.</i> (1982) cultivated <i>Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae,</i> <i>E. agglomerans,</i>
group D <i>Streptococcus, </i> and <i>Bacillus</i> sp. from
marijuana supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA). Kurup <i>et al.</i> (1983) isolated several thermophilic
actinomycetes from marijuana cigarettes, including <i>Thermoactinomyces
candidus, T. vulgaris, </i> and <i>Micropolyspora faeni.</i>
These organisms, while not infectious, cause allergic pneumonitis
in hypersensitive individuals. </p>

<h3>Fungi</h3>

<p>In the popular press, Margolis and Clorfene (1975) and DuToit
(1980) describe molds colonizing marijuana in the United States
and South Africa, respectively. Surprisingly, both accounts
report the mold enhancing psychotropic effects of marijuana.
These publications initiated a fad among marijuana users, who
exposed their marijuana to molds in the hope of increasing the
potency of their crop.</p>

<p> The &quot;black weblike fungus&quot; described by Margolis
&amp; Clorfene (1975) suggests an <i>Aspergillus</i> species.
Chusid <i>et al.</i> (1975) cite <i>A. fumigatus</i> causing
pneumonitis in a patient who buried his marijuana in the ground
for &quot;aging.&quot; <i> </i>Llamas <i>et al.</i> (1978)
recovered <i>A. fumigatus </i> from marijuana owned by a patient
suffering allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Kagen (1981)
isolated several <i>Aspergillus</i> species from moldy marijuana,
including <i>A. fumigatus, A. niger </i>and <i>A. flavus. </i>Babu <i>et
al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>A. niger, A. flavus, A. tamarii, A.
sulphureus,</i> and <i>A. repens</i> from seeds in marijuana.
Schwartz (1985) isolated <i>A. niger</i> from the sinuses of a
marijuana smoker who suffered severe headaches. Llewellyn &amp;
O'Rear (1977) demonstrated aflatoxin production in marijuana
contaminated with <i>A. flavus</i> and <i>A. parasiticus.</i></p>

<p> <i>Penicillium</i> species have been isolated from marijuana
cigarettes by Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i>
(1983). Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>P. chrysogenum</i>
from <i>Cannabis</i> seeds. Bush Doctor (1993) reports isolating <i>P.
italicum</i> from marijuana stored with an orange peel at 0<font
size="1">o </font>C.</p>

<p> <i>Mucor</i> species have been recovered from marijuana by
Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i> (1983). A
related zygomycete, <i>Rhizopus stolonifer,</i> was isolated from
damp marijuana by Bush Doctor (1993).</p>

<p> Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured several other fungi from <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds that, according to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), may cause
opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. These include <i>Alternaria
alternata </i>and <i>Curvularia lunata.</i> McPartland (1983,
1991, 1992) recovered these fungi from <i>Cannabis</i> in the
field, plus a <i>Fusarium</i> spp. All these fungi produce
toxins. Ramírez (1990) reports four policeman contracting
histoplasmosis, caused by <i>Histoplasma capsulatum,</i> after
destroying a <i>Cannabis</i> field in Puerto Rico. </p>

<h2>Detecting contaminants in marijuana</h2>

<p>Cultivators and consumers of illicit marijuana identify
microbiological contaminants by several crude, but seemingly
effective, screening techniques (Bush Doctor 1993). Their methods
mimic those used by tobacco growers (Lucas 1975). </p>

<h3>Visual screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana often darkens in color and exhibits
changes in surface texture. Strands of white to pale-gray fungal
hyphae become visible in moldy material. Exposed to light, the
fungi sporulate, providing a &quot;fuzzy&quot; appearance.
Generally, <i>Rhizopus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species produce
grey-black spores, <i>Penicillium</i> conidia are light
blue-green, and <i>Aspergillus</i> conidia are dark green-black. </p>

<h3>Olfactory screen</h3>

<p>Uncontaminated marijuana produces a minty or aromatic odor.
Once infested, the smell changes to a &quot;stale&quot; or
&quot;musty&quot; odor. Bush Doctor (1993) reports <i>P. italicum </i>producing
a lavender or lilac odor, and <i>A. flavus</i> &quot;smells like
a locker room.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana undergoing rapid decay may feel warm to
touch. </p>

<h3>Fluorescence screen</h3>

<p>Bush Doctor (1993) screened marijuana for aflatoxin-producing <i>A.
flavus</i> with a UV-A lamp. Contaminated material fluoresces a
light green color. This screening method has not been tested by
other researchers (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear 1977). </p>

<h3>Identification</h3>

<p>If any of the above screening tests is positive, the suspect
marijuana is discarded, without identifying the contaminant. If
identification is desired, the marijuana is either cultured or
bioassayed. Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kagen<i> et al.</i>
(1983) provide the description of culture methods used to
identify microbiological contaminants.</p>

<p> Marijuana can also be tested with bioassay kits, to detect
specific organisms. These assays utilize ELISA (enzyme linked
immunoabsorbent assay) biotechnology. They are more sensitive
than cultures and much quicker, but also much more expensive.
Positive identification of microbiological toxins may require gas
chromatography (Rood <i>et al</i>. 1988) </p>

<h2>Eliminating contaminants</h2>

<p>Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) demonstrated that spores of <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species survive in smoke drawn
from pyrolyzed marijuana cigarettes. Also, some microbiological
toxins are not degraded by combustion (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear
1977).</p>

<p> Moody <i>et al. </i>(1982) evaluated waterpipes for smoking <i>Aspergillus-</i>
contaminated marijuana. They found only a 15% reduction in
transmission of fungal spores.</p>

<p> Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggested baking marijuana in home
ovens at 150<font size="1">o </font>C, for five minutes before
smoking. Oven treatment killed conidia of <i>A. fumigatus, A.
flavus</i> and <i>A. niger, </i>and did not degrade the active
component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</p>

<p> Ungerlerder <i>et al. </i>(1982) gas-sterilized marijuana
with a mix of 12% ethylene oxide and 88% dichlorodifluoromethane,
at 8.5-10 psi, for 4.5-5 hours. They report no loss of THC from
fumigation. But residues remain in air pockets of fumigated
material, posing another health hazard. They also sterilized
marijuana with high-dose Cobalt 60 irradiation (20,000 Gray Units
or less), again without THC reduction.</p>

<p> None of these methods, however, degrade microbial antigens.
Sensitized patients may still develop bronchospasm after smoking
treated material. Nor do these methods decompose microbial
toxins.</p>

<p> The best method of eliminating microbial antigens and toxins
is by exclusion. This requires careful attention by both
cultivators and consumers. Proper cultivation techniques should
eliminate human pathogens. Careful cultivation also excludes most
opportunistic plant pathogens. Particular attention is required
at harvest, to avoid damaging marijuana before it completely
dries. Flue-cured marijuana contains fewer opportunistic fungi
than air or sweat-cured crops. Sweat-cured <i>Cannabis </i>
(common in illicit marijuana from Colombia) maintains a
&quot;tradition&quot; of <i>Aspergillus</i> contamination (Bush
Doctor 1993).</p>

<p> Bush Doctor (1975) states that infestation by opportunistic
fungi cannot occur in plant material below 15% moisture content
(MC). Properly dried marijuana contains about 10% MC (material
below 10% MC becomes excessively brittle). The dried, unmanicured
marijuana, in small aliquots, can then be vacuum-sealed in
plastic pouches. This packaging differs from the marijuana
currently supplied by NIDA. NIDA supplies marijuana as manicured,
pre-rolled cigarettes, in tin cans (Chait and Pierri 1989).</p>

<p> Opening sealed pouches of marijuana reexposes the material to
contamination. Consumers must prevent marijuana from resorbing
moisture above 15% MC. Storage at freezer temperatures will not
protect marijuana above 15% MC. Placing a lemon or orange peel in
stored marijuana (to impart a &quot;pleasant bouquet,&quot;
according to Frank and Rosenthal, 1978) is discouraged, because
the peel may introduce <i>Penicillium</i> or <i>Aspergillus</i>
spp. into the stored marijuana. Contaminated material should be
discarded. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Many publications have described a variety of microorganisms
resident on marijuana. Nevertheless, most researchers remain
unaware of these hazards. Schwartz (1987) wonders if the source
of a young patient's <i>Curvularia lunata</i> sinusitis could be
from contaminated marijuana. Brummund <i>et al.</i> (1987) reply
that this is possible, but no <i>Curvularia </i>species have been
cited in the <i>Cannabis </i>literature. However, this was indeed
reported by Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977). More recently, another
Schwartz (1992) states, &quot;I am unaware of any report of non-<i>Aspergillus </i>fungal
contamination of marijuana cigarettes.&quot; The publications
cited herein, provide such reports.</p>

<p> Carefully cultivated and harvested marijuana harbors a
minimum of hazardous microorganisms. For added protection,
material must be screened for contamination before it is packaged
for use as medical marijuana. Since opportunistic infections pose
the greatest danger to immunosuppressed consumers, marijuana
should be sterilized, preferably by gamma irradiation. Lastly,
consumers must be given careful instructions to ensure their
marijuana does not become contaminated prior to use. </p>
