<br>
The study of technology, society, biosphere interactions 
and its application to the development of preventive 
approaches for the engineering, management and 
regulation of modern technology. Examples include: 
pollution prevention, industrial ecology, design for 
environment, energy demand management, healthy 
workplace design, and healthy sustainable city concepts. 
These methods take a proactive approach to dealing with 
the social and environmental consequences of 
technology, which is typically more cost-effective while 
reducing burdens imposed on society and the 
environment.<p>
