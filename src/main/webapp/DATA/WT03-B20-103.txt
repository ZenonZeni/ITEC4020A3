     The plan of putting into operation the power generating capacities on the
nuclear power plants (NPPs) of the USSR of 11.9 million KW within 1966-1977, including NPPs with the reactors of the new type namely RBMK-1000 of 8 million KW was confirmed by the resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 29.09.66. The Leningrad NPP became the head nuclear power plant with these reactors.
<P>
     In line with mentioned plan the deficit problem of electrical energy in the Central energy consumption region of the United Energy System (UES) of the south being the largest among UES of the European part of the country by both volume of electrical energy consumption and sizes of installed capacity could be solved by the help of one of the nuclear power plants. UES of the South has covered the area of 27 administrative districts  of Ukrainian SSR as well as of Rostov district with 0.7 million square km and with population up to 53 million people.
In the European part of the country about 26% total installed capacity and 25% total electricity consumption was fallen to UES share.
<P>
     Electricity consumption was to be increased by approximately 3.5 times in this region from 1970 to 1990 to assessments of the Ukraine department of "Ehnergoset'proekt" Institute of Minehnergo (Ministry of Energy) of USSR made in 1974.

     The location of the new NPP in Ukraine's Central districts would be economically attractive when it was considered that the rational radius of NPP influence formed 350-450 km.
<P>
     This NPP originally named as Central-Ukrainian was to be consisted of two generating units 
by 1000 MW each.
<P>
     Place selection for construction of Central-Ukrainian NPP was performed by Kiev department
of "Teploehnergoproekt" Institute of Minehnergo of USSR and Kiev design bureau "Ehnergoset'proekt".
<P>
Two construction places were proposed:
<UL>
<LI> Ladyzhiny (Vinnitskij district);
<LI> Kopachi (Kievskij district).
</UL>
The board of Gosplan of Ukr.SSR specifies the NPP location near Kopachi and named it as Chernobyl by resolution on 18.01.67.
<P>
Resolution of the central Committee of USSR Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of USSR
by 02.02.67 stated the resolution of UkrSSR Gosplan. In this case the following aspects were taken into account:
<UL>
<LI> Low density of population within the NPP location.
<LI> Availability of the significant water supply source (Pripyat` river).
<LI> Low productivity of alienable lands.
<LI> Proximity of the main line (station Yanov of the South-West railway).
<LI> Developed network of automobile roads with solid coating.
<LI> Favourable geographic, climatic and etc. conditions allowing the fast employment of personnel.
</UL>
<P>
The industrial site of Chernobyl NPP is located in the eastern part of the region named Belorussko-Ukrainskoe Poles'e, 160 km to the north-east of Kiev, 15 km to the north-west of Chernobyl (Kiev district).
