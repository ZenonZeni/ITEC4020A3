From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: Day 1 </H3>

Whoever is in charge of ordering the weather this year once again gets our
praise.  It was a perfect spring day Sunday at Library Park in Waterbury CT.
The event promises to be more interesting than ever, with a bus, several
custom made cars, 3 hybrid powered cars, a car constructed by an ELEMENTARY(!) school team, plus cars from Japan, the Czech Republic, and Canada in the race.<P>

But, I arrived before most of the cars were here, so I started my interviews
with Jay Tarler who was working on the charging panel that was donated by
General Public Utilities, General Electric and Northeast Utilities to NESEA
last year.  This panel has a capacity of over 600 amperes, 3-phase (delta).
There are 4 subpanels and 81(!) plugs.  Most of the plugs are rated either 120
volts at 20 or 30 amps or 240 at 15, 20, and 30 amps, plus a couple of 3-phase 50 amp outlets used last year by the Chrylser mini-vans.  All the outlets are protected by Ground Fault Interrupters (GFIs).  <P>

This year, each car's charger will be connected to it's own Watt-hour meter, they can measure exactly how much energy was delivered to each car.  Each car also has its own Watt-hour meter on the leads to the motor, so the energy actually delivered to the motor will also be measured.  In this way, the total energy used for charging can be compared to the energy that actually results in propelling the car and thus the efficiency of the charging/storage/controller system can be calculated.<P>
  
In
addition, the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA, the sponsor of
the race) has issued what American Tour de Sol (ATdS) Director Nancy Hazard
calls the "NESEA Energy Challenge".  The idea is to quantify the amount of
energy (measured in equivalent barrels of oil) it takes to move different cars
down the road.  This metering will let them calculate a "wells to wheels
energy (measured in equivalent barrels of oil) it takes to move different cars
down the road.  This metering will let them calculate a "wells to wheels
efficiency rating" for traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles,
pure Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (HEVs).<P>

        Bob Goodrich, who built the original ATdS charging panels, now retired
from Northeast Utilities, will be doing the calculations, which will include
estimates for the efficiency of the power plant (modeled as a modern turbine
oil-fired plant), the transmission line loss, etc.  The results will be in a
paper to be presented at the Sustainable Transportation/Solar and Electric
Vehicles conference this fall.  The efficiency study is funded by the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI).          <P>

In addition to the vehicle system
efficiency measures, there is an additional test, funded by a grant from the
Electric Vehicle Research Network, that looks at the "quality" of the
electricity at the charging station.  Of particular interest is the so-called
"charger harmonics".  At last year's race, several cars wound up not getting
full charges because the circuit breakers kicked out.  The culprit was rumored
to be the "harmonics", essentially electrical noise created by the charger on
the electric line, that caused the breakers to trip.  Look for more on all
this later.<P>

Ah, but you probably really wanted to hear about cars!<P>

The Solar Bolt, number 61 from Bolton High School, Bolton CT, is the
returning
Lead-Acid battery Champion.  In the 1994 ATdS, this car did 141.7 miles on a
single charge on a 120 Volt, Trojan T145 battery, Advanced DC motor and a
Curtis controller.  Tom Aitkin and Brad Koerner said that, in fact, the
Curtis
controller died a couple of days ago, and they have replaced it with the new
500 amp Curtis.  Other than that, it is the same electrical system, including
the same batteries.  The only modification is an extension to the belly pan
to
close an air-gap.  The car itself is adapted from a 1974 Fiat, found rusting
in the woods.<P>

Another returning vehicle, after skipping last year's race is number 83, the
Sol Survivor III by the ConVal Solar Race Car Team which will be in the Solar
Racing category.  (No plugging in allowed!)  Paul Waterman, and advisor to the
high school team from Dublin, NH, said that they haven't been idle.  Last year
the car climbed Mt. Washington in the "Race to the Clouds".  The car has been
much improved.  It now has a second motor as a result of the hill climbing
experience, better instrumentation to aid in energy management, and a student
team with each member performing specific functions; mechanics, electricals,
cooks, first aid, etc.  The car body is somewhat modified from two years ago,
with a larger spoiler (topped with solar cells) that is moved rearward quite a
distance so as not to shadow the solar cells on the roof.  There are also
solar cells on the hood, and a panel that is carried in the car that can be
set up at each stop to collect some extra rays.  The solar panels total 680
watts.  The energy system charges 60 Volts of GNB sealed gel-pack batteries.
The two motors are each 6 Horse Power (HP) brushed DC motors which drive the
wheels through a two-speed transmission.  Top speed is somewhere above 50
mph,
but the most efficient speed is closer to 30 mph.  And when it climbed Mt
Washington, it made about 25 mph.<P>

Larry Dussault is the editor of the Great Lakes Electric Auto Association (GLEAA) and the Great Lakes Electric Auto News (GLEAN), although he claims
the
GLs now stand for GLobal, since they have over 3,000 members from around the
world.  He and Michael Beebe are here from Ohio with the ZeeVee 88, number
67.
Why 88?  "8 hours to recharge, and we are looking for 80 miles to a charge."
The car has a Honda Civic frame, with an added integrated roll cage around
the
driver, a custom fiberglass body, two seats, convertable hard-top, and a
gross
weight of 2300 pounds (with driver).  The 120 Volt Genisis battery system
consists of 3 strings in parallel (30 of the 26 amp-hour units!).  The Curtis
500-amp controller drives an Advanced DC motor.  It is for sale!  A mere
$30,000 will get you this beautiful, bright red car.  513 599-1233. Michael Beebe earns at least some of his living by testing vehicles.  He and
Bob Batson gave a very compelling pair of safety talks at the ST/SEV
conference last fall.  At the ATdS this year, Michael and Gary Carr are going
to judge the high school cars and hand out safety plaques for the best.<P>

Michael Orr is also here from Ohio, with number 73, the Electric Fiero,
sponsored by the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Co.  It is a gold 1986 Pontiac
Fiero, converted using 9-inch Advanced DC motor, 12 12-Volt sealed GNB
batteries, Curtis 1231 500-amp controller, and a Michael's on custom designed
charger, "because it was cheaper."  The adaptation is very clean.  The trunk
is still there (as much as a Fiero trunk ever was ;-) ), the motor is bolted
directly to the transmission, and all the original gauges still work.  "The
car still has all its crashworthiness and safety."  Stop speed is 75 mph, and
a range of "40 miles in a hilly area."  (That is going to be quite a
challenge considering some of the legs of the race are over 65 miles.)<P>

Number 93, Helios the Heron II, comes from the Riverside School in
Lyndonville
VT, an <b>elementary</b>  school, grades 4 through 8, of 43 students.  I spoke
with Anna Van Fleet, one of the students.  The new car looks nothing like the
car this school entered in the ATdS last year (and which never actually ran)
but in fact it shares a skeletal frame, the motor, and battery from the
original.  The whole school got involved with the project again, and a few
are
lucky enough to come along for the race.  Forest Reider, in the 7th grade,
said, "The car has 6 16 Volt solar panels made from used solar cells (which
are brown instead of the usual blue)."  "(It also has) 9 12-Volt batteries, a
motor that requires 120 volts.  It took us 5 million, billion, quadrillion
rivets and a lot of time, a lot of Bondo, and a lot of duct tape," according
to Anna.  According to the flyer handed out by the students, the parts of
this
year's car come from a Ford Festiva, which the students "ripped apart."
Shocks, struts, steering linkage and column.  The motor chain drives the
single rear wheel.  Since none of the students is old enough to drive, the
car
is driven by their Latin/English/Phys-Ed teacher Karen Budde.
          When I saw the car, it was moving under its own power, although it
was making a popping sound (that sounded sort of like back-firing(?)) and by
the time it climbed the small hill up the grass to the testing area, the
front
wheels were leaning in a most disconcerting manner.  A bolt through the wheel
hub was not holding properly, but did not break or strip.<P>

Number 70 is the SUN-BUNNY, is a converted VW Rabbit.  The project by the
Fall Mountain High School in Alstead, NH.  Aaron Blake told me that it has a
144 Volt system made of Deka Dominator batteries, the 500 amp Curtis
controller, and the 9-inch Advanced DC motor.  The car has been on the road 3
days, so this is the first real test of its capabilities.  Why so late, if
they started working on the project in October?  "We got our money on April
20th.  So we got the call that our grant was accepted and cut POs (purchase
orders) 2 seconds later," Aaron told me.<P>

Number 64 is the Kineticar II, returning again from Connecticut Solar
Electric
Racing Team/Nougatuk Valley Community Technical College (CSERT-NVCTC).
 Arthur
Gagnon told me that this has the same battery pack as last year, and the
aging
seems to have helped.  They also added sway bars that have improved their
stearing performance.  Again we have 20 6-Volt batteries, 400-amp Curtis
controller, and an 9-inch Advanced DC motor.<P>

Number 74 is the Lightning Volt from Parkland High School/Leigh County Vo-
Tech.  This bright red, shiny S-10 conversion is actually the same one that
raced in the 1994 ATdS.  Jeromia Jarecke and Monique Polk told me that the
team put a lot effort into body work, including a sun roof (added when
someone
sanded through the roof), a new interior, slightly more efficient solar
panels, and a laptop to plot data from the Watt-hour meter as they drive.
They also added regenerative braking by putting a magnetic clutch on the
motor
which engages a belt drive to an alternator.  When going down a hill, they
down-shift to get the motor spinning really fast, engage the clutch and put
about 11 amps back into the batteries.<P>

Number 89, Envirocycle III is from Central Conneticut State University
(CCSU).
Dave Kohlen, Evan Anozine, Alfred Yeats and Glen Dobbs told me about this
motor cycle that started life as a Szuzuki JS6R-1100 that now runs on 72
Volts
provided by lead-acid gel-cell batteries.  They power an 11 HP Uniq brushless
DC permanent-magnet motor that drives the rear wheel through a grip-notch
toothed belt.  They expect a range of about 100 miles, with a maximum speed
of
75 mph, although they have geared it for most-efficient speed of 35 to 40
mph.
They don't really know what they are going to get because the bike arrived
with 5 miles on it.  The students designed the bike during the fall and
actually started building it during the spring semester.  The frame is
augmented with steel to help take the extra 300 pounds of the batteries.
 CCSU
arrived with their "traditional" portable building.  This huge trailer comes
complete with a small machine shop and, new this year, some bunk beds.  In
the
past, the chargers have not always worked properly during the overnight
charging, so now they will station someone at the charging station to deal
with any problems that arise overnight.<P>

David Fabricatore represents the Connecticut Commuter Electric Vehicle
Demonstration Program.  They are going to have 5 Solectria Force cars to test for commuter uses within the state.  This 18 month project will have
volunteers using the cars for commuting and carpooling.  In the ATdS, they
have two Forces.  Number 50 is powered has the Electrosource Horizon
batteries.  It was finished up Friday night and driven to Waterbury by
Solectria this morning.  It is a 156 Volt system with 14,400 Watt-hours of
capacity.  Number 51 is running a 156 Volt pack of Interstate wet-cell
batteries, to deal with the 70 mile days in the race, and will be driven by
students from the Ethel Walker school in Simsbury.  (In the project, number
51
will be running Sonnenschein gel-cell batteries which do not require
maintenance, but don't have quite as much range.)<P>
