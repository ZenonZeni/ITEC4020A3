        Introduction <br>
        <br>
        This review of the literature on the health and
        psychological effects<br>
        of cannabis was undertaken at the initiative of the
        former Federal <br>
        Justice Minister, Senator Michael Tate, who requested a
        review of<br>
        knowledge relating to cannabis, to inform policy
        decisions. At Senator<br>
        Tate's urging, a National Task Force on Cannabis was
        established on 25<br>
        May 1992. The Task Force commissioned this review of the
        evidence on<br>
        the health and psychological effects of cannabis use. A
        new and <br>
        independent review was thought necessary because there
        has not been<br>
        any major international review of the literature on the
        health and<br>
        psychological effects of cannabis since 1981, when the
        Addiction <br>
        Research Foundation and World Health Organization jointly
        reviewed the<br>
        literature. The purpose of this review was to update the
        conclusions <br>
        of earlier reviews in the light of research undertaken
        during the past<br>
        decade.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Our approach to the literature<br>
        <br>
        Our review of the literature was not intended to be as
        comprehensive <br>
        as the major review undertaken by the Addiction Research
        Foundation <br>
        and the World Health Organization. The literature is too
        large, and<br>
        the diversity of relevant disciplines represented in it
        beyond the<br>
        expertise we had available for the task. Unavoidably, we
        have relied<br>
        upon expert opinion in the areas that lie outside the
        authors' <br>
        collective expertise which is primarily in areas of
        epidemiology, <br>
        psychiatry, psychopharmacology, neurophysiology and
        neuropsychology. <br>
        <br>
        In order to minimise the effects of our lack of expertise
        in certain <br>
        areas we have relied upon the consensus views expressed
        in the <br>
        literature by experts in the relevant fields. When there
        has been <br>
        controversy between the experts we have explicitly
        acknowledged areas<br>
        of disagreement. We have checked our understanding and
        representation <br>
        of these expert views by asking Australian and overseas
        researchers <br>
        with expertise in the relevant fields to critically
        review what we<br>
        have written. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Our approach to assessing the health effects of cannabis <br>
        <br>
        The evaluation of the health hazards of any drug is
        difficult for a<br>
        number of reasons. First, causal inferences about the
        effects of drugs<br>
        on human health are difficult to make, especially when
        the interval <br>
        between use and alleged ill effects is a long one. It
        takes time for<br>
        adverse effects to develop and for research to identify
        such effects. <br>
        <br>
        Second, in making causal inferences there is a tension
        between the<br>
        rigour and relevance of the evidence. The most rigorous
        evidence is<br>
        provided by laboratory investigations using animals or in
        vitro <br>
        preparations (e.g. cell preparations in a test tube) in
        which well<br>
        controlled drug doses are related to precisely specified
        biological <br>
        outcomes. The relevance of this evidence to human disease
        is<br>
        uncertain, however, because many inferences have to be
        made in linking<br>
        the occurrence of specific biological effects in
        laboratory animals to<br>
        the likely effects of human use. Epidemiological studies
        of<br>
        relationships between drug use and human disease are of
        greater <br>
        relevance to the appraisal of the health risks of human
        drug use, but<br>
        their relevance is purchased at the price of reduced
        rigour. Doses of<br>
        illicit drugs over periods of years are difficult to
        quantify because<br>
        of the varied dosages of blackmarket drugs and the stigma
        in admitting <br>
        to illicit drug use. Interpretation is further
        complicated by <br>
        correlations between cannabis use and alcohol, tobacco
        and other <br>
        illicit drug use. <br>
        <br>
        Third, appraisals of the hazards of drug use are affected
        by the <br>
        social approval of the drugs in question. The
        countercultural <br>
        symbolism of cannabis use in the late 1960s has
        introduced an <br>
        unavoidable sociopolitical dimension to the debate about
        the severity <br>
        of its adverse health effects. Politically conservative
        opponents of<br>
        cannabis use justify continued prohibition by citing
        evidence of the<br>
        personal and social harms of cannabis use. When the
        evidence is <br>
        uncertain they resolve uncertainty by assuming that the
        drug is unsafe<br>
        until proven safe. Complementary behaviour is exhibited
        by proponents <br>
        of cannabis use. Evidence of harm is discounted and
        uncertainties <br>
        about the ill-effects of chronic cannabis use resolved by
        demanding <br>
        better evidence, arguing that until such evidence is
        available <br>
        individuals should be allowed to choose whether or not
        they use the<br>
        drug.<br>
        <br>
        Such evidential standards are rarely applied
        consistently. The <br>
        politically conservative would reject a similar approach
        to the <br>
        appraisal of the health hazards of industrial processes.
        Similarly, <br>
        proponents of cannabis liberalisation rarely apply the
        principles used<br>
        in their risk assessment of cannabis to the appraisal of
        the health <br>
        effects of pharmaceutical drugs, industrial processes,
        and pesticides. <br>
        To guard against such double evidential standards we will
        be as <br>
        explicit as possible about the evidential standards we
        have used, and<br>
        attempt to be as even-handed as we can in their
        application.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Evidential desiderata<br>
        <br>
        The burden of proof concerns who bears the responsibility
        for making a<br>
        case: those who make a claim of adverse health effects of
        cannabis, or<br>
        those who doubt it. If the burden falls on those who
        claim that it is<br>
        safe, uncertainty will be resolved by assuming that it is
        unsafe until<br>
        proved otherwise; conversely, if the burden falls on
        those who claim<br>
        that the drug is unsafe, then it will be assumed to be
        safe until <br>
        proven otherwise. <br>
        <br>
        It is by no means agreed who bears the burden of proof in
        the debate<br>
        about the health effects of cannabis use. Proponents of
        continued <br>
        prohibition appeal to established practice, arguing that
        since the<br>
        drug is illegal the burden of proof falls upon those who
        want to<br>
        legalise it; opponents of existing policies argue that
        the burden of<br>
        proof falls upon those who wish to use the criminal law
        to prevent <br>
        adults from freely choosing to use a drug.<br>
        <br>
        We will vary the burden of proof depending upon the state
        of the <br>
        evidence and argument. Once a prima facie case of harm
        has been made,<br>
        positive evidence of safety is required rather than the
        simple absence<br>
        of any evidence of ill effect. We will assume that a
        prima facie case<br>
        has been made when there is either direct evidence that
        the drug has<br>
        ill effects in humans or animals (e.g. from a
        case-control study), or<br>
        there is a compelling argument that it could, e.g. since
        tobacco <br>
        smoking causes lung cancer, and since cannabis and
        tobacco smoke are<br>
        similar in their constituents, it is probable that heavy
        cannabis <br>
        smoking also causes lung cancer. <br>
        <br>
        Standard of proof reflects the degree of confidence
        required in an<br>
        inference that there is a causal connection between drug
        use and harm.<br>
        In courts of law, the standard of proof demanded depends
        upon the<br>
        seriousness of the offence at issue and the consequences
        of a verdict,<br>
        with a higher standard of proof, &quot;beyond reasonable
        doubt&quot;, being<br>
        demanded in criminal cases, and the &quot;balance of
        probabilities&quot; being<br>
        acceptable in civil cases. Scientists generally require
        something <br>
        closer to the standard of &quot;beyond reasonable
        doubt&quot; than the balance<br>
        of probabilities before they draw confident conclusions
        of harm. <br>
        However, since there are few adverse health effects of
        cannabis use<br>
        which meet this standard, we will indicate when the
        evidence permits <br>
        an inference to be made on the balance of probabilities.<br>
        <br>
        The criteria for causal inference that we will use are
        standard ones.<br>
        These are: (1) evidence that there is a relationship
        between cannabis <br>
        use and a health outcome provided by one of the accepted
        types of<br>
        research design (namely, case-control, cross-sectional,
        cohort, or<br>
        experiment); (2) evidence provided by a statistical test
        or confidence <br>
        interval that the relationship is unlikely to be due to
        chance; (3)<br>
        good evidence that drug use precedes the adverse effect
        (e.g. from a<br>
        cohort study); and (4) evidence either from experiment,
        or<br>
        observational studies with statistical or other form of
        control, which<br>
        makes it unlikely that the relationship is due to some
        other variable <br>
        which is related to both cannabis use and the adverse
        health effect. <br>
        <br>
        In the trade-off between relevance and rigour, our
        preference will be<br>
        for human evidence, both experimental and
        epidemiological, over animal<br>
        and in vitro studies. In the absence of human evidence,
        in vitro and<br>
        animal experiments will be regarded as raising a
        suspicion that drug<br>
        use has an adverse effects on human health, with the
        degree of <br>
        suspicion being in proportion to the number of such
        studies, the <br>
        consistency of their results across different species and
        experimental <br>
        preparations, and the degree of expert consensus on the<br>
        trustworthiness of the inferences from effects in vitro
        and in vivo to<br>
        adverse effects on human health under existing patterns
        of usage. <br>
        <br>
        Ideally, it would be desirable to quantify the magnitude
        of risk posed<br>
        by cannabis use by estimating both the relative and
        attributable risks<br>
        of specific health effects. However, since there is
        generally <br>
        insufficient evidence to estimate these risks for many
        putative <br>
        adverse effects of cannabis, the magnitude of a health
        risk posed by<br>
        cannabis use will be qualitatively assessed by a
        comparison of its<br>
        probable health effects with those of two other widely
        used<br>
        recreational drugs, alcohol and tobacco. The motive for
        such a <br>
        comparison is to minimise double standards in the
        appraisal of the<br>
        health effects of cannabis use by providing some kind of
        common <br>
        standard, however approximate, for making societal
        decisions about <br>
        cannabis use.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Cannabis the drug <br>
        <br>
        Cannabis is a generic name for a variety of preparations
        derived from<br>
        the plant Cannabis sativa. A sticky resin which covers
        the flowering <br>
        tops and upper leaves, most abundantly in the female
        plant, contains <br>
        more than 60 cannabinoid substances. Laboratory research
        on animals <br>
        and humans has demonstrated that the primary psychoactive
        constituent <br>
        in cannabis is the cannabinoid,
        delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The cannabinoid receptor<br>
        <br>
        Cannabis resembles the opioid drugs in acting upon
        specific receptors <br>
        in the brain. In this respect it differs from alcohol,
        cocaine and<br>
        other illicit drugs which act by disrupting brain
        processes. The <br>
        determination and characterisation of a specific
        cannabinoid receptor <br>
        has made it possible to map its distribution in the
        brain, and to<br>
        demonstrate that its well-known psychoactive effects are
        receptor <br>
        mediated. Very recently an endogenous brain molecule has
        been <br>
        discovered which binds to the cannabinoid receptor and
        mimics the<br>
        action of cannabinoids. It has been called
        &quot;anandamide&quot;, from the<br>
        Sanskrit word for bliss. Its discovery promises to
        stimulate a great<br>
        deal of research which will improve our understanding of
        the role <br>
        played by a cannabinoid-like system of the brain, and
        elucidate the<br>
        mechanism of action of cannabis.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Forms of cannabis<br>
        <br>
        The concentration of THC varies between the three most
        common forms of<br>
        cannabis: marijuana, hashish and hash oil. Marijuana is
        prepared from<br>
        the dried flowering tops and leaves of the harvested
        plant. The <br>
        potency of the marijuana depends upon the growing
        conditions, the<br>
        genetic characteristics of the plant and the proportions
        of plant <br>
        matter. The flowering tops and bracts are highest in THC<br>
        concentration, with potency descending through the upper
        leaves, lower<br>
        leaves, stems and seeds. The concentration of THC in a
        batch of <br>
        marijuana containing mostly leaves and stems may range
        from 0.5-5 per<br>
        cent, while the &quot;sinsemilla&quot; variety with
        &quot;heads&quot; may have THC<br>
        concentrations of 7-14 per cent. <br>
        <br>
        Hashish or hash consists of dried cannabis resin and
        compressed <br>
        flowers. The concentration of THC in hashish generally
        ranges from 2-8<br>
        per cent, although it can be as high as 10-20 per cent.
        Hash oil is a<br>
        highly potent and viscous substance obtained by
        extracting THC from<br>
        hashish (or marijuana) with an organic solvent,
        concentrating the<br>
        filtered extract, and in some cases subjecting it to
        further<br>
        purification. The concentration of the THC in hash oil is
        generally <br>
        between 15 per cent and 50 per cent.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Routes of administration<br>
        <br>
        Almost all possible routes of administration have been
        used, but by<br>
        far the most common method is smoking (inhaling).
        Marijuana is most<br>
        often smoked as a hand-rolled &quot;joint&quot;, the size
        of a cigarette or<br>
        larger. Tobacco is often added to assist burning, and a
        filter is<br>
        sometimes inserted. Hashish may also be mixed with
        tobacco and smoked<br>
        as a joint, but it is probably more frequently smoked
        through a pipe,<br>
        with or without tobacco. A water pipe known as a
        &quot;bong&quot; is a popular<br>
        implement for all cannabis preparations because the water
        cools the<br>
        hot smoke before it is inhaled and there is little loss
        of the drug<br>
        through sidestream smoke. Hash oil is used sparingly
        because of its<br>
        extremely high psychoactive potency; a few drops may be
        applied to a<br>
        cigarette or a joint, to the mixture in the pipe, or the
        oil may be<br>
        heated and the vapours inhaled. Whatever method is used,
        smokers <br>
        inhale deeply and hold their breath for several seconds
        in order to<br>
        ensure maximum absorption of THC by the lungs. <br>
        <br>
        Hashish may also be cooked or baked in foods and eaten.
        When ingested <br>
        orally the onset of the psychoactive effects is delayed
        by about an<br>
        hour. The &quot;high&quot; may be of lesser intensity but
        the duration of<br>
        intoxication is longer by several hours. It is easier to
        titrate the<br>
        dose and achieve the desired level of intoxication by
        smoking than by<br>
        ingestion, since the effects from smoking are more
        immediate. Crude<br>
        aqueous extracts of cannabis have been very rarely
        injected<br>
        intravenously, but this route is unpopular since THC is
        insoluble in<br>
        water, and hence, little or no drug is actually present
        in these <br>
        extracts. Moreover, the injection of tiny undissolved
        particles may<br>
        cause severe pain and inflammation at the site of
        injection, and a<br>
        variety of toxic systemic effects. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Dosage<br>
        <br>
        A typical joint contains between 0.5g and 1.0g of
        cannabis plant <br>
        matter, which may vary in THC content between 5mg and
        150mg (i.e. <br>
        typically between 1 per cent and 15 per cent). The actual
        amount of<br>
        THC delivered in the smoke has been estimated at 20-70
        per cent, the<br>
        rest being lost through combustion or sidestream smoke.
        The<br>
        bioavailability of THC (the fraction of THC in the
        cigarette which <br>
        reaches the bloodstream) from marijuana cigarettes in
        human subjects <br>
        has been reported to range from 5-24 per cent. Given all
        of these <br>
        variables, the actual dose of THC absorbed when cannabis
        is smoked is<br>
        not easily quantified. <br>
        <br>
        In general, only a small amount of cannabis (e.g. 2-3mg
        of available <br>
        THC) is required to produce a brief pleasurable high for
        the<br>
        occasional user, and a single joint may be sufficient for
        two or three<br>
        individuals. A heavy smoker may consume five or more
        joints per day,<br>
        while heavy users in Jamaica, for example, may consume up
        to 420mg THC<br>
        per day. In clinical trials designed to assess the
        therapeutic <br>
        potential of THC, single doses have ranged up to 20mg in
        capsule form.<br>
        In human experimental research, THC doses of 10mg, 20mg
        and 25mg have<br>
        been administered as low, medium and high doses.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Patterns of use<br>
        <br>
        Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in
        Australia, having <br>
        been tried by a third of the adult population, and by the
        majority of<br>
        young adults between the ages of 18 and 25. The most
        common route of<br>
        administration is by smoking, and the most widely used
        form of the<br>
        drug is marijuana. In the majority of cases cannabis use
        is<br>
        &quot;experimental&quot;, that is, most users use the
        drug on a small number of<br>
        occasions, and either discontinue their use, or use
        intermittently and<br>
        episodically after first trying it. Even among those who
        continue to<br>
        use the drug over longer periods, the majority
        discontinue their use<br>
        in their mid to late 20s. <br>
        <br>
        Only a small proportion of those who ever use cannabis
        use it on a<br>
        daily basis over an extended period such as several
        years. Because of<br>
        uncertainties about the dose received, there is no good
        information on<br>
        the amount of THC ingested by such regular users.
        &quot;Heavy&quot; use is<br>
        consequently defined approximately in terms of frequency
        of use rather<br>
        than the estimated average dose of THC received. The
        daily or near<br>
        daily use pattern over a period of years is the pattern
        that probably <br>
        places cannabis users at greatest risk of experiencing
        long-term <br>
        health and psychological consequences of use. Daily
        cannabis users are<br>
        more likely to be male and less well educated; they are
        also more <br>
        likely to regularly use alcohol and to have experimented
        with a<br>
        variety of other illicit drugs, such as, amphetamines,
        hallucinogens, <br>
        psychostimulants, sedatives and opioids.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Metabolism of cannabinoids <br>
        <br>
        Different methods of ingesting cannabis give rise to
        differing <br>
        pharmacokinetics, i.e. patterns of absorption, metabolism
        and <br>
        excretion of the active agent. Upon inhalation, THC is
        absorbed from<br>
        the lungs into the bloodstream within minutes. After oral<br>
        administration absorption is much slower, taking one to
        three hours<br>
        for THC to enter the bloodstream, and delaying the onset
        of<br>
        psychoactive effects. When cannabis is smoked, the
        initial metabolism <br>
        of THC takes place in the lungs, followed by more
        extensive metabolism <br>
        by liver enzymes, with the transformation of THC to a
        number of <br>
        metabolites. The most rapidly produced metabolite is
        9-carboxy-THC, <br>
        which is detectable in blood within minutes of smoking.
        Another major<br>
        metabolite produced is 11-hydroxy-THC, which is
        approximately 20 per<br>
        cent more potent than THC, and penetrates the blood-brain
        barrier more<br>
        rapidly. It is present at very low concentrations in the
        blood after<br>
        smoking, but at high concentrations after the oral route.
        THC and its<br>
        hydroxylated metabolites account for most of the observed
        effects of<br>
        the cannabinoids.<br>
        <br>
        Peak blood levels of THC are usually reached within 10
        minutes of<br>
        smoking, and decline rapidly thereafter to about 5-10 per
        cent of<br>
        their initial level within the first hour. This initial
        rapid decline<br>
        reflects both rapid conversion to its metabolites, as
        well as the<br>
        distribution of unchanged THC to lipid-rich tissues,
        including perhaps<br>
        the brain. <br>
        <br>
        THC and its metabolites are highly fat soluble and may
        remain for long<br>
        periods in the fatty tissues of the body, from which they
        are slowly<br>
        released back into the bloodstream. The terminal
        half-life of THC (the<br>
        time required to clear half of the administered dose from
        the body) is<br>
        significantly shorter for experienced or daily users
        (19-27 hours) <br>
        than for inexperienced users (50-57 hours). Since tissue
        distribution <br>
        is similar for both users and non-users, it is the
        immediate and <br>
        subsequent metabolism that occurs more rapidly in
        experienced users.<br>
        Given the slow clearance of THC, repeated administration
        results in<br>
        the accumulation of THC and its metabolites in the body.
        Because of<br>
        its slow release from fatty tissues back into the
        bloodstream, THC and<br>
        its metabolites may be detectable in blood for several
        days, and <br>
        traces may persist for several weeks. Several studies
        have examined <br>
        measures of cannabinoids in fat, confirming that THC may
        be stored for<br>
        at least 28 days. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Detection of cannabinoids in body fluids<br>
        <br>
        Cannabinoid levels in the body depend on both the dose
        given and the<br>
        smoking history of the individual, but are subject to a
        vast degree of<br>
        individual variability. Plasma levels of THC in man may
        range between<br>
        0-500ng/ml, depending on the potency of the cannabis
        ingested and the<br>
        time since smoking. The detection of THC in blood above
        10-15ng/ml <br>
        provides evidence of recent consumption of the drug,
        although how<br>
        recent is not possible to determine. A more precise
        estimate of time<br>
        of consumption may be obtained from the ratio of THC to
        9-carboxy-THC: <br>
        similar concentrations of both in blood indicate very
        recent use (in<br>
        the vicinity of 20-40 minutes) and a high probability of
        intoxication. <br>
        When the levels of 9-carboxy-THC are substantially higher
        than those<br>
        of THC itself, ingestion could be estimated to have
        occurred more than<br>
        half an hour ago. It is very difficult to determine the
        time of <br>
        administration from blood concentrations even if the
        smoking habits of<br>
        the individual and the exact dose consumed were known.
        Therefore, the<br>
        results of blood analyses are not easily interpreted and,
        at best, <br>
        only confirm the &quot;recent&quot; use of cannabis.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Intoxication and levels of cannabinoids<br>
        <br>
        Since there is evidence that cannabis intoxication
        adversely affects <br>
        skills required to drive a motor vehicle (see below), it
        would be<br>
        desirable to have a reliable measure of impairment due to
        cannabis <br>
        intoxication that was comparable to the breath test of
        alcohol <br>
        intoxication. However, there is no clear relationship
        between blood<br>
        levels of THC or its metabolites and degree of either
        impairment or<br>
        subjective intoxication. A general consensus of forensic
        toxicologists <br>
        is that blood concentrations associated with impairment
        after smoking<br>
        cannabis have not been sufficiently established to
        provide a basis for<br>
        legal testimony in cases concerning driving a motor
        vehicle while <br>
        under the influence of cannabis. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Acute psychological and health effects<br>
        <br>
        The major reason for the widespread recreational use of
        cannabis is<br>
        that it produces a &quot;high&quot;, an altered state of
        consciousness which is<br>
        characterised by mild euphoria, relaxation, and
        perceptual<br>
        alterations, including time distortion and the
        intensification of<br>
        ordinary sensory experiences, such as eating, watching
        films, and<br>
        listening to music. When used in a social setting the
        high is often<br>
        accompanied by infectious laughter, and talkativeness.
        Cognitive <br>
        effects are also marked. They include impaired short-term
        memory, and<br>
        a loosening of associations, which make it possible for
        the user to<br>
        become lost in pleasant reverie and fantasy. Motor skills
        and reaction<br>
        time are also impaired, so skilled activity of various
        kinds is <br>
        frequently disrupted.<br>
        <br>
        Not all the acute psychological effects of cannabis are
        welcomed by<br>
        users. The most common unpleasant psychological effects
        are anxiety, <br>
        sometimes producing frank panic reactions, or a fear of
        going mad, and<br>
        dysphoric or unpleasant depressive feelings. Psychotic
        symptoms such<br>
        as delusions and hallucinations may be more rarely
        experienced at very<br>
        high doses. These effects are most often reported by
        naive users who<br>
        are unfamiliar with the drug's effects, and by patients
        who have been<br>
        given oral THC for therapeutic purposes. More experienced
        users may<br>
        occasionally report these effects after oral ingestion of
        cannabis, <br>
        when the effects may be more pronounced and of longer
        duration than<br>
        those usually experienced after smoking cannabis. These
        effects can<br>
        usually be prevented by adequately informing users about
        the type of<br>
        effects they may experience, and once developed can be
        readily managed<br>
        by reassurance and support.<br>
        <br>
        The inhalation of marijuana smoke, or the ingestion of
        THC has a<br>
        number of bodily effects. Among these the most dependable
        is an <br>
        increase in heart rate of 20-50 per cent over baseline,
        which occurs<br>
        within a few minutes to a quarter of an hour, and lasts
        for up to<br>
        three hours. Changes in blood pressure also occur, which
        depend upon<br>
        posture: blood pressure is increased while the person is
        sitting, and<br>
        decreases while standing. In healthy young users these
        cardiovascular <br>
        effects are unlikely to be of any clinical significance
        because <br>
        tolerance develops to the effects of THC, and young,
        healthy hearts <br>
        will only be mildly stressed.<br>
        <br>
        The acute toxicity of cannabis, and cannabinoids more
        generally, is<br>
        very low. There are no confirmed cases of human deaths
        from cannabis <br>
        poisoning in the world medical literature. This is
        unlikely to be due<br>
        to a failure to detect such deaths, because animal
        studies indicate <br>
        that the dose of THC required to produce 50 per cent
        mortality in<br>
        rodents is extremely high by comparison with other
        commonly used <br>
        pharmaceutical and recreational drugs. The lethal dose
        also increases <br>
        as one moves up the phylogenetic tree, suggesting by
        extrapolation <br>
        that the lethal dose in humans could not be achieved by
        either smoking<br>
        or ingesting the drug. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Psychomotor effects and driving<br>
        <br>
        The major potential health risk from the acute use of
        cannabis arises<br>
        from its effects on psychomotor performance. Intoxication
        produces <br>
        dose-related impairments in a wide range of cognitive and
        behavioural <br>
        functions that are involved in skilled performances like
        driving an<br>
        automobile or operating machinery. The negative effects
        of cannabis on<br>
        the performance of psychomotor tasks is almost always
        related to dose.<br>
        The effects are generally larger, more consistent and of
        increased <br>
        persistence in difficult tasks which involve sustained
        attention. The<br>
        acute effects of doses of cannabis which are subjectively
        equivalent <br>
        to or higher than usual recreational doses on driving
        performance in<br>
        laboratory simulators and over standardised driving
        courses, are <br>
        similar to those of doses of alcohol that achieve blood
        alchol <br>
        concentrations between 0.07 per cent and 0.10 per cent. <br>
        <br>
        While cannabis impairs performance in laboratory and
        simulated driving<br>
        settings, it is difficult to relate the magnitude of
        these impairments <br>
        to the risk of being involved in motor vehicle accidents.
        Studies of<br>
        the effects of cannabis on on-road driving performance
        have found at<br>
        most modest impairments. Cannabis intoxicated persons
        drive more <br>
        slowly, and generally take fewer risks, than alcohol
        intoxicated <br>
        drinkers, probably because they are more aware of their
        level of<br>
        psychomotor impairment.<br>
        <br>
        There is no controlled epidemiological evidence that
        cannabis users<br>
        are at increased risk of being involved in motor vehicle
        or other <br>
        accidents. This is in contrast to the case of alcohol use
        and <br>
        accidents, where case-control studies have shown that
        persons with<br>
        blood alcohol levels indicative of intoxication are
        over-represented <br>
        among accident victims. All that is available are studies
        of the <br>
        prevalence of cannabinoids in the blood of motor vehicle
        and other <br>
        accident victims, which have found that between 4 per
        cent and 37 per<br>
        cent of such blood samples have contained cannabinoids,
        typically in<br>
        association with blood alcohol levels indicative of
        intoxication. <br>
        These studies are difficult to evaluate for a number of
        reasons. <br>
        <br>
        First, in the absence of information on the prevalence of
        cannabinoids <br>
        in the blood of non-accident victims, we do not know
        whether persons <br>
        with cannabinoids are over-represented among accident
        victims. Second,<br>
        the presence of cannabinoids in blood indicates only
        recent use, not<br>
        necessarily intoxication at the time of the accident.
        Third, there are<br>
        also serious problems of causal attribution, since more
        than 75 per<br>
        cent of drivers with cannabinoids in their blood also
        have blood <br>
        levels indicative of alcohol intoxication. <br>
        <br>
        Attempts have been made to circumvent the first
        difficulty by using<br>
        NIDA Household survey data (from the United States) to
        estimate what<br>
        proportion of drivers might be expected to have
        cannabinoids in their<br>
        blood and urine. These suggest that cannabis users are
        two to four<br>
        times more likely to be represented among accident
        victims than <br>
        non-cannabis users; cannabis users who also use alcohol,
        rather than<br>
        cannabis only users, are even more likely to be
        over-represented among<br>
        accident victims. Other indirect support for an increased
        risk of<br>
        accidental death associated with cannabis use comes from
        surveys of<br>
        self-reported accidents among adolescent drug users, and
        from <br>
        epidemiological studies of the relationships between
        cannabis use and<br>
        mortality, and health service utilisation. <br>
        <br>
        The known effects of interactions between cannabis and
        other drugs on<br>
        psychomotor performance are what would be predicted from
        their <br>
        separate effects. The drug most often used in combination
        with <br>
        cannabis is alcohol. The separate effects of alcohol and
        cannabis on<br>
        psychomotor impairment and driving performance are
        approximately <br>
        additive. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The effects of chronic cannabis use<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Cellular effects and the immune system <br>
        <br>
        There is reasonably consistent evidence that some
        cannabinoids, most<br>
        especially THC, can produce a variety of cellular
        changes, such as<br>
        alterations to cell metabolism, and DNA synthesis, in
        vitro (i.e. in<br>
        the test tube). There is stronger and more consistent
        evidence that<br>
        cannabis smoke is mutagenic in vitro, and in vivo (i.e.
        in live <br>
        animals), and hence, that it is potentially carcinogenic.
        If cannabis <br>
        smoke is carcinogenic then it is probably for the same
        reasons that<br>
        cigarette smoke is, rather than because it contains
        cannabinoids. <br>
        Hence, if chronic cannabis smoking causes cancer, it is
        most likely to<br>
        develop after long-term exposure at those sites which
        receive maximum<br>
        exposure, namely, the lung and upper aerodigestive tract
        (see below). <br>
        <br>
        There is reasonably consistent evidence that cannabinoids
        impair both<br>
        the cell-mediated and humoral immune systems in rodents.
        Humoral <br>
        immune suppression is seen in decreased antibody
        formation responses <br>
        to antigens, and decreased lymphocyte response to B-cell
        mitogens. <br>
        Cell-mediated immune suppression is revealed by a
        reduction in <br>
        lymphocyte response to T-cell mitogens. These changes
        have produced <br>
        decreased resistance to infection by a bacteria and a
        virus. There is<br>
        also evidence that the non-cannabinoid components of
        cannabis smoke<br>
        impair the functioning of alveolar macrophages, the first
        line of the<br>
        body's defence system in the lungs. The clinical
        relevance of these<br>
        findings is uncertain, however. The doses required to
        produce these<br>
        effects have generally been very high, and the problem of<br>
        extrapolating to the effects of doses used by humans is
        complicated by<br>
        the possibility that tolerance may also develop to such
        effects. <br>
        <br>
        The limited experimental and clinical evidence in humans
        is mixed, <br>
        with a small number of studies suggesting adverse effects
        that have<br>
        not been replicated by others. At present, there is no
        conclusive <br>
        evidence that consumption of cannabinoids predisposes man
        to immune <br>
        dysfunction, as measured by reduced numbers or impaired
        functioning of<br>
        T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes or macrophages, or reduced
        immunoglobulin <br>
        levels. There is suggestive evidence that THC impairs
        T-lymphocyte <br>
        responses to mitogens and allogenic lymphocytes.<br>
        <br>
        The clinical and biological significance of these
        possible<br>
        immunological impairments in chronic cannabis users is
        uncertain. To<br>
        date there has been no epidemiological, or even
        anecdotal, evidence of<br>
        increased rates of disease among chronic heavy cannabis
        users, such as<br>
        was seen among young homosexual men in the early 1980s
        when the <br>
        Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome was first recognised.
        There is one<br>
        large prospective study of HIV-positive homosexual men
        which indicates <br>
        that continued cannabis use did not increase the risk of
        progression <br>
        to AIDS. Given the duration of large-scale cannabis use
        by young <br>
        adults in Western societies, the absence of any epidemics
        of<br>
        infectious disease makes it unlikely that cannabis
        smoking produces <br>
        major impairments in the immune system. <br>
        <br>
        It is more difficult to exclude the possibility that
        chronic heavy <br>
        cannabis use produces a minor impairment in immunity.
        Such an effect<br>
        would be manifest in small increases in the rate of
        occurrence of<br>
        common bacterial and viral illnesses among chronic users
        which could<br>
        have escaped detection in the few studies that have
        attempted to<br>
        address the issue. Such an increase could nonetheless be
        of public <br>
        health significance because of the increased expenditure
        on health <br>
        services, and the loss of productivity that it would
        cause among the<br>
        young adults who are the heaviest users of cannabis. <br>
        <br>
        The possibility that cannabinoids may produce minor
        impairments in the<br>
        immune system would also raise doubts about the
        therapeutic usefulness <br>
        of cannabinoids in immunologically compromised patients,
        such as those<br>
        undergoing cancer chemotherapy, or those with AIDS. AIDS
        patients may<br>
        provide one of the best populations in which to detect
        any such <br>
        effects. If it was ethical to conduct clinical trials of
        cannabinoids <br>
        to improve appetite and well-being in AIDS patients, then
        studies of<br>
        the impact of cannabis use on their compromised immune
        systems would<br>
        provide one way of evaluating the seriousness of this
        concern. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The cardiovascular system<br>
        <br>
        There is insufficient new evidence to change the
        conclusions reached <br>
        by the Institute of Medicine in 1982, namely, that
        although the <br>
        smoking of marijuana &quot;causes changes to the heart
        and circulation that<br>
        are characteristic of stress ... there is no evidence ...
        that it<br>
        exerts a permanently deleterious effect on the normal
        cardiovascular <br>
        system...&quot; (p72). The situation may be less benign
        for patients with<br>
        hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and coronary
        atherosclerosis, in<br>
        which case there is evidence that marijuana poses a
        threat because it<br>
        increases the work of the heart. The &quot;magnitude and
        incidence&quot; of the<br>
        threat remains to be determined as the cohort of chronic
        cannabis <br>
        users of the late 1960s enters the age of maximum risk
        for<br>
        complications of atherosclerosis in the heart, brain and
        peripheral <br>
        blood vessels. In the interim, because any such effects
        could be life<br>
        threatening in patients with significant occlusion of the
        coronary <br>
        arteries or other cerebrovascular disease, patients with<br>
        cardiovascular disease should be advised not to consume
        cannabis, and<br>
        perhaps not to use THC therapeutically.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The respiratory system<br>
        <br>
        Chronic heavy cannabis smoking impairs the functioning of
        the large<br>
        airways, and probably causes symptoms of chronic
        bronchitis such as<br>
        coughing, sputum production, and wheezing. Given the
        adverse effects <br>
        of tobacco smoke, which is qualitatively very similar in
        composition <br>
        to cannabis smoke, it is likely that chronic cannabis use
        predisposes <br>
        individuals to develop chronic bronchitis and respiratory
        cancer. <br>
        There is reasonable evidence for an increased risk of
        chronic <br>
        bronchitis, and evidence that chronic cannabis smoking
        may produce <br>
        histopathological changes in lung tissues of the kind
        that precede the<br>
        development of lung cancer.<br>
        <br>
        More recently, concern about the possibility of cancers
        being induced<br>
        by chronic cannabis smoking has been heightened by case
        reports of<br>
        cancers of the aerodigestive tract in young adults with a
        history of<br>
        heavy cannabis use. Although these reports fall short of
        providing <br>
        convincing evidence because many of the cases
        concurrently used <br>
        alcohol and tobacco, they are clearly a major cause for
        concern, since<br>
        such cancers are usually rare in adults under the age of
        60, even <br>
        among those who smoke tobacco and drink alcohol. The
        conduct of <br>
        case-control studies of these cancers should be a high
        priority for<br>
        research which aims to identify the possible adverse
        health effects of<br>
        chronic cannabis use.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Reproductive effects<br>
        <br>
        Chronic cannabis use probably disrupts the male and
        female<br>
        reproductive systems in animals, reducing testosterone
        secretion, and<br>
        sperm production, motility, and viability in males, and
        disrupting the<br>
        ovulatory cycle in females. It is uncertain whether it is
        likely to<br>
        have these effects in humans, given the inconsistency in
        the limited <br>
        literature on human males, and the lack of research in
        the case of<br>
        human females. There is also uncertainty about the
        clinical<br>
        significance of these effects in normal healthy young
        adults. They may<br>
        be of greater concern among young adolescents, and among
        males with<br>
        fertility impaired for other reasons.<br>
        <br>
        Cannabis use during pregnancy probably impairs foetal
        development, <br>
        leading to smaller birthweight, perhaps as a consequence
        of shorter <br>
        gestation, and probably by the same mechanism as
        cigarette smoking, <br>
        namely, foetal hypoxia. There is uncertainty about
        whether cannabis <br>
        use during pregnancy produces a small increase in the
        risk of birth<br>
        defects as a result of exposure of the foetus in utero.
        Prudence <br>
        demands that until this issue is resolved, women should
        be advised not<br>
        to use cannabis during pregnancy, or when attempting to
        conceive. <br>
        <br>
        There is not a great deal of evidence that cannabis use
        can produce <br>
        chromosomal or genetic abnormalities in either parent
        which could be<br>
        transmitted to offspring. Such animal and in vitro
        evidence as exists<br>
        suggests that the mutagenic capacities of cannabis smoke
        are greater <br>
        than those of THC, and are probably of greater relevance
        to the risk<br>
        of users developing cancer than to the transmission of
        genetic defects<br>
        to children.<br>
        <br>
        There is suggestive evidence that infants exposed in
        utero to cannabis<br>
        may experience transient behavioural and developmental
        effects during<br>
        the first few months after birth. There is a single study
        which <br>
        suggests an increased risk of childhood leukemia
        occurring among the<br>
        children born to women who used cannabis during their
        pregnancies. Its<br>
        replication is of some urgency. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Psychological effects of chronic cannabis use<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Adolescent development <br>
        <br>
        There is strong continuity of development from
        adolescence into early<br>
        adult life in which many indicators of adverse
        development which have<br>
        been attributed to cannabis use precede its use, and
        increase the<br>
        likelihood of using cannabis. These include minor
        delinquency, poor<br>
        educational performance, nonconformity, and poor
        adjustment. A <br>
        predictable sequence of initiation into the use of
        illicit drugs was<br>
        identified among American adolescents in the 1970s, in
        which the use<br>
        of licit drugs preceded experimentation with cannabis,
        which preceded <br>
        the use of hallucinogens and &quot;pills&quot;, which in
        turn preceded the use<br>
        of heroin and cocaine. Generally, the earlier the age of
        initiation <br>
        into drug use, and the greater the involvement with any
        drug in the<br>
        sequence, the greater the likelihood of progression to
        the next drug<br>
        in the sequence.<br>
        <br>
        The causal significance of these findings, and especially
        the role of<br>
        cannabis in the sequence of illicit drug use, remains
        controversial. <br>
        The hypothesis that the sequence of use represents a
        direct<br>
        pharmacological effect of cannabis use upon the use of
        later drugs in<br>
        the sequence is the least compelling. A more plausible
        and better <br>
        supported explanation is that it reflects a combination
        of two <br>
        processes: the selective recruitment into cannabis use of<br>
        nonconforming and deviant adolescents who have a
        propensity to use<br>
        illicit drugs; and the socialisation of cannabis users
        within an<br>
        illicit drug using subculture which increases the
        exposure,<br>
        opportunity, and encouragement to use other illicit
        drugs.<br>
        <br>
        Although strong conclusions cannot be drawn, on the
        evidence from <br>
        cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of cohorts of
        American <br>
        adolescents in the 1970s and 1980s, there are suggestions
        that chronic<br>
        heavy cannabis use can adversely affect adolescent
        development in a<br>
        number of ways.<br>
        <br>
        There has been suggestive support for the hypothesis that
        heavy <br>
        adolescent use of cannabis impairs educational
        performance. In <br>
        cross-sectional surveys, cannabis use is related to an
        increased risk<br>
        of failing to complete a high school education, and of
        job instability <br>
        in young adulthood. These relationships in
        cross-sectional studies are<br>
        exaggerated because those who are most likely to use
        cannabis have<br>
        lower pre-existing academic aspirations and high school
        performance <br>
        than those who do not use it. When pre-existing academic
        aptitude and<br>
        interest are taken into account, the relationship between
        cannabis use<br>
        and educational and occupational performance is much more
        modest. Even<br>
        though modest, the suggestive adverse effects of cannabis
        and other<br>
        drug use upon educational performance are important
        because they may<br>
        cascade throughout young adult life, affecting choice of
        occupation, <br>
        level of income, choice of mate, and quality of life of
        the user and<br>
        his or her children. <br>
        <br>
        There is weaker but suggestive evidence that heavy
        cannabis use has<br>
        adverse effects upon family formation, mental health, and
        involvement <br>
        in drug-related (but not other types of) crime. In the
        case of each of<br>
        these outcomes, the apparently strong associations
        revealed in <br>
        cross-sectional data are much more modest in longitudinal
        studies, <br>
        after statistically controlling for associations between
        cannabis use<br>
        and other variables which predict these adverse outcomes.
        <br>
        <br>
        On balance, there are sufficient indications that
        cannabis use in<br>
        adolescence probably adversely affects adolescent
        development to<br>
        conclude that it is desirable to discourage adolescent
        cannabis use,<br>
        and especially regular cannabis use. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Adult adjustment<br>
        <br>
        The evidence that chronic heavy cannabis use produces an
        amotivational <br>
        syndrome among adults is equivocal. The positive evidence
        largely <br>
        consists of case histories, and observational reports.
        The small <br>
        number of controlled field and laboratory studies have
        not found <br>
        compelling evidence for such a syndrome, although their
        evidential <br>
        value is limited by the small sample sizes and limited<br>
        sociodemographic characteristics of the field studies,
        and by the<br>
        short periods of drug use, and the youthful good health
        and minimal <br>
        demands made of the volunteers observed in the laboratory
        studies. If<br>
        there is such a syndrome, it is a relatively rare
        occurrence, even<br>
        among heavy, chronic cannabis users. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        A dependence syndrome<br>
        <br>
        A cannabis dependence syndrome like that defined in
        DSM-III-R probably<br>
        occurs in heavy, chronic users of cannabis. There is good
        experimental <br>
        evidence that chronic heavy cannabis users can develop
        tolerance to<br>
        its subjective and cardiovascular effects, and there is
        suggestive <br>
        evidence that some users may experience a withdrawal
        syndrome on the<br>
        abrupt cessation of cannabis use. There is clinical and<br>
        epidemiological evidence that some heavy cannabis users
        experience <br>
        problems in controlling their cannabis use, and continue
        to use the<br>
        drug despite experiencing adverse personal consequences
        of use. There<br>
        is limited evidence in favour of a cannabis dependence
        syndrome <br>
        analogous to the alcohol dependence syndrome. If the
        estimates of the<br>
        community prevalence of drug dependence provided by the
        Epidemiologic <br>
        Catchment Area study are correct, then cannabis
        dependence is the most<br>
        common form of dependence on illicit drugs. <br>
        <br>
        Recognition of the cannabis dependence syndrome has been
        delayed by a<br>
        number of factors. First, heavy daily cannabis use has
        been relatively <br>
        uncommon, and there have been few individuals who have
        requested <br>
        assistance in stopping their cannabis use. Second, an
        overemphasis on<br>
        evidence of tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome has
        hindered the <br>
        recognition of the syndrome among individuals who have
        presented for<br>
        treatment. Third, the occurrence of cannabis dependence
        has probably <br>
        been overshadowed because it is most common among persons
        who are<br>
        dependent on alcohol and opioids, forms of drug
        dependence which have<br>
        understandably been given higher treatment priority. <br>
        <br>
        Given the widespread use of cannabis, and its continued
        reputation as<br>
        a drug free of the risk of dependence, the clinical
        features of <br>
        cannabis dependence deserve to be better defined. This
        would enable <br>
        the prevalence of a dependence syndrome to be better
        estimated and<br>
        individuals who are dependent on cannabis to be better
        recognised and<br>
        treated. Treatment should probably be on the same
        principles as other<br>
        forms of dependence, although this issue is also in need
        of research. <br>
        <br>
        Although cannabis dependence is likely to be a larger
        problem than<br>
        previously thought, we should be wary of over-estimating
        its social <br>
        and public health importance. Estimates of the risk of
        users becoming <br>
        dependent suggest that it may be similar to that of
        alcohol, that it<br>
        will be highest among the minority of daily cannabis
        users, and that<br>
        even in this group the prevalence of drug-related
        problems may be<br>
        relatively low by comparison with those of alcohol
        dependence. There<br>
        is likely to be a high rate of remission of cannabis
        dependence <br>
        without formal treatment. While acknowledging the
        existence of the<br>
        syndrome, we should avoid exaggerating its prevalence and
        the severity<br>
        of its adverse effects on individuals. Better research on
        the <br>
        experiences of long-term cannabis users should provide
        more precise <br>
        estimates of the risk. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Cognitive effects<br>
        <br>
        The weight of the available evidence suggests that the
        long-term heavy<br>
        use of cannabis does not produce any severe impairment of
        cognitive <br>
        function. There is reasonable clinical and experimental
        evidence, <br>
        however, that the long-term use of cannabis may produce
        more subtle <br>
        cognitive impairment in the higher cognitive functions of
        memory, <br>
        attention and organisation and integration of complex
        information. <br>
        While subtle, these impairments may affect everyday
        functioning, <br>
        particularly in adolescents with marginal educational
        aptitude, and<br>
        among adults in occupations that require high levels of
        cognitive <br>
        capacity. The evidence suggests that the longer the
        period that <br>
        cannabis has been used, the more pronounced is the
        cognitive<br>
        impairment. It remains to be seen whether the impairment
        can be <br>
        reversed by an extended period of abstinence from
        cannabis.<br>
        <br>
        There is a need for research to identify the specific
        cognitive <br>
        functions affected by long-term cannabis use, to identify
        the precise<br>
        mechanisms that produce impairment and to relate them to
        biological <br>
        mechanisms, including the cannabinoid receptors and the
        endogenous <br>
        cannabinoid, anandamide. Such research also needs to
        investigate <br>
        individual differences in susceptibility to such effects,
        and the<br>
        impact of long-term cannabis use on adolescents and young
        adults. <br>
        Appropriate treatment programs for long-term dependent
        cannabis users<br>
        will also need to address the subtle cognitive
        impairments likely to<br>
        be found in this population.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Brain damage<br>
        <br>
        A suspicion that chronic heavy cannabis use may cause
        gross structural <br>
        brain damage was provoked by a single poorly controlled
        study using an<br>
        outmoded method of investigation, which reported that
        cannabis users<br>
        had enlarged cerebral ventricles. This finding was widely
        and <br>
        uncritically publicised. Since then a number of better
        controlled <br>
        studies using more sophisticated methods of investigation
        have <br>
        consistently failed to demonstrate evidence of structural
        change in<br>
        the brains of heavy, long-term cannabis users. These
        negative results<br>
        are consistent with the evidence that any cognitive
        effects of chronic<br>
        cannabis use are subtle, and hence unlikely to be
        manifest as gross<br>
        structural changes in the brain. They do not exclude the
        possibility <br>
        that chronic, heavy cannabis use may cause
        ultrastructural changes at<br>
        the receptor level.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Psychotic disorders<br>
        <br>
        There is suggestive evidence that heavy cannabis use can
        produce an<br>
        acute toxic psychosis in which confusion, amnesia,
        delusions, <br>
        hallucinations, anxiety, agitation and hypomanic symptoms
        predominate. <br>
        The evidence for an acute toxic cannabis psychosis comes
        from <br>
        laboratory studies of the effects of THC on normal
        volunteers and<br>
        clinical observations of psychotic symptoms in heavy
        cannabis users<br>
        which seem to resemble those of other toxic psychoses,
        and which remit<br>
        rapidly following abstinence. <br>
        <br>
        There is less support for the hypothesis that cannabis
        use can cause<br>
        either an acute or a chronic functional psychosis which
        persists <br>
        beyond the period of intoxication. Such a possibility is
        difficult to<br>
        study because of the rarity of such psychoses, and the
        near<br>
        impossibility of distinguishing them from schizophrenia
        and manic <br>
        depressive psychoses occurring in individuals who also
        abuse cannabis. <br>
        <br>
        There is strongly suggestive evidence that chronic
        cannabis use may<br>
        precipitate a latent psychosis in vulnerable individuals.
        This is only<br>
        strongly suggestive because in the best study conducted
        to date, the<br>
        use of cannabis was not documented at the time of
        diagnosis, there was<br>
        a possibility that cannabis use was confounded by
        amphetamine use, and<br>
        there are doubts about whether the study could reliably
        distinguish <br>
        between schizophrenia and acute cannabis-induced, or
        other<br>
        drug-induced, psychoses. Even if this relationship is
        causal, its<br>
        public health significance should not be overstated: the
        estimated <br>
        attributable risk of cannabis use is small (less than 10
        per cent), <br>
        and even this seems an overestimate, since the incidence
        of<br>
        schizophrenia declined over the period when cannabis use
        increased <br>
        among young adults. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Therapeutic effects of cannabinoids<br>
        <br>
        There is reasonable evidence that THC is an effective
        anti-emetic <br>
        agent for patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy,
        especially those<br>
        whose nausea has proven resistant to the anti-emetic
        drugs that were<br>
        widely used in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when most
        of the <br>
        research was conducted. It is uncertain whether THC is as
        effective as<br>
        newer anti-emetic drugs. Uncertainty also exists about
        the most <br>
        optimal method of dosing and the advantages and
        disadvantages of<br>
        different routes of administration. Nonetheless, there is
        probably <br>
        sufficient evidence to justify THC being made available
        in synthetic <br>
        form to cancer patients whose nausea has proven resistant
        to<br>
        conventional treatment. <br>
        <br>
        There is also reasonable evidence for the potential
        efficacy of THC<br>
        and marijuana in the treatment of glaucoma, especially in
        cases which<br>
        have proved resistant to existing anti-glaucoma agents.
        Further <br>
        research is required to establish the effectiveness and
        safety of<br>
        long-term use, but this should not prevent its use under
        medical <br>
        supervision in individuals with poorly controlled
        glaucoma. <br>
        <br>
        There is sufficient suggestive evidence of the potential
        usefulness of<br>
        various cannabinoids as anti-spasmodic, and
        anti-convulsant agents to<br>
        warrant further clinical research into their
        effectiveness. There are<br>
        other potential therapeutic uses which require more basic<br>
        pharmacological and experimental investigation, e.g.
        cannabinoids as<br>
        possible analgesic and anti-asthma agents. <br>
        <br>
        There is a need for further research into the
        effectiveness of <br>
        cannabis and its derivatives in assisting patients with<br>
        HIV/AIDS-related conditions, and in particular, their
        value in <br>
        counteracting weight loss associated with these
        conditions, improving <br>
        mood and easing pain. Case reports have suggested that
        synthetic THC<br>
        may be effective in reducing nausea and stimulating
        appetite in <br>
        symptomatic AIDS patients. While there is a potential
        concern that<br>
        possible effects of cannabinoids on the immune system may
        have more<br>
        serious consequences for HIV positive individuals and
        AIDS patients, a<br>
        recent study has failed to find a relationship between
        the use of<br>
        cannabis, or any other psychoactive drugs, and the rate
        at which HIV<br>
        positive people progress to clinical AIDS.<br>
        <br>
        Despite the basic and clinical research work which was
        undertaken in<br>
        late 1970s and early 1980s, the cannabinoids have not
        been widely used<br>
        therapeutically, nor has further investigation been
        conducted along<br>
        the lines suggested by the Institute of Medicine in 1982.
        This seems<br>
        attributable to the fact that, in the United States,
        where most <br>
        cannabis research has been conducted, clinical research
        on<br>
        cannabinoids has been discouraged by regulation and a
        lack of funding.<br>
        The discouragement of clinical cannabis research, in
        turn, derives <br>
        from the fact that THC, the most therapeutically
        effective<br>
        cannabinoid, is the one that produces the psychoactive
        effects sought<br>
        by recreational users. An unreasonable fear that the
        therapeutic use<br>
        of THC would send &quot;mixed messages&quot; to youth has
        motivated the<br>
        discouragement of research into the therapeutic effects
        of<br>
        cannabinoids. <br>
        <br>
        The recent discovery of a specific cannabinoid receptor
        and the <br>
        endogenous cannabinoid-like substance anandamide may
        change this <br>
        situation by encouraging more basic research on the
        biology of <br>
        cannabinoids which may have therapeutic consequences. It
        may prove <br>
        possible to separate the psychoactive and therapeutic
        effects of<br>
        cannabis, fulfilling the ancient promise of
        &quot;marijuana as medicine&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall appraisal of the health and psychological risks
        of cannabis <br>
        use <br>
        <br>
        The following is a summary of the major adverse health
        and<br>
        psychological effects of acute and chronic cannabis use,
        classified by<br>
        the degree of confidence about the relationship between
        cannabis use<br>
        and the adverse effect.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Acute effects <br>
        <br>
        The major acute adverse psychological and health effects
        of cannabis <br>
        intoxication are:<br>
        <br>
        anxiety, dysphoria, panic and paranoia, especially in
        naive<br>
        users;<br>
        <br>
        cognitive impairment, especially of attention and memory;
        <br>
        <br>
        psychomotor impairment, and possibly an increased risk of<br>
        accident if an intoxicated person attempts to drive a
        motor vehicle; <br>
        <br>
        an increased risk of experiencing psychotic symptoms
        among those<br>
        who are vulnerable because of personal or family history
        of psychosis; <br>
        and<br>
        <br>
        an increased risk of low birth weight babies if cannabis
        is used<br>
        during pregnancy.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Chronic effects<br>
        <br>
        The major health and psychological effects of chronic
        heavy cannabis <br>
        use, especially daily use, over many years, remain
        uncertain. On the<br>
        available evidence, the major probable adverse effects
        appear to be:<br>
        <br>
        respiratory diseases associated with smoking as the
        method of<br>
        administration, such as chronic bronchitis, and the
        occurrence of<br>
        histopathological changes that may be precursors to the
        development of<br>
        malignancy;<br>
        <br>
        development of a cannabis dependence syndrome,
        characterised by<br>
        an inability to abstain from or to control cannabis use;
        and<br>
        <br>
        subtle forms of cognitive impairment, most particularly
        of<br>
        attention and memory, which persist while the user
        remains chronically <br>
        intoxicated, and may or may not be reversible after
        prolonged <br>
        abstinence from cannabis.<br>
        <br>
        The following are the major possible adverse effects of
        chronic, heavy<br>
        cannabis use which remain to be confirmed by further
        research: <br>
        <br>
        an increased risk of developing cancers of the
        aerodigestive <br>
        tract, i.e. oral cavity, pharynx, and oesophagus; <br>
        <br>
        an increased risk of leukemia among offspring exposed in
        utero; <br>
        <br>
        a decline in occupational performance marked by
        underachievement <br>
        in adults in occupations requiring high level cognitive
        skills, and<br>
        impaired educational attainment in adolescents; and<br>
        <br>
        birth defects occurring among children of women who used
        cannabis<br>
        during their pregnancies.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        High risk groups<br>
        <br>
        A number of groups can be identified as being at
        increased risk of<br>
        experiencing some of these adverse effects. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Adolescents<br>
        <br>
        Adolescents with a history of poor school performance may
        have<br>
        their educational achievement further limited by the
        cognitive <br>
        impairments produced by chronic intoxication with
        cannabis. <br>
        <br>
        Adolescents who initiate cannabis use in the early teens
        are at<br>
        higher risk of progressing to heavy cannabis use and
        other illicit<br>
        drug use, and to the development of dependence on
        cannabis. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Women of childbearing age<br>
        <br>
        Pregnant women who continue to smoke cannabis are
        probably at<br>
        increased risk of giving birth to low birth weight
        babies, and perhaps<br>
        of shortening their period of gestation.<br>
        <br>
        Women of childbearing age who smoke cannabis at the time
        of<br>
        conception or while pregnant possibly increase the risk
        of their<br>
        children being born with birth defects. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Persons with pre-existing diseases<br>
        <br>
        Persons with a number of pre-existing diseases who smoke
        cannabis are<br>
        probably at an increased risk of precipitating or
        exacerbating <br>
        symptoms of their diseases. These include: <br>
        <br>
        individuals with cardiovascular diseases, such as
        coronary artery<br>
        disease, cerebrovascular disease and hypertension; <br>
        <br>
        individuals with respiratory diseases, such as asthma,
        bronchitis<br>
        and emphysema; <br>
        <br>
        individuals with schizophrenia who are at increased risk
        of<br>
        precipitating or of exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms;
        and<br>
        <br>
        individuals who are dependent on alcohol and other drugs,
        who are<br>
        probably at an increased risk of developing dependence on
        cannabis.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Two special concerns<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Storage of THC<br>
        <br>
        There is good evidence that with repeated dosing of
        cannabis at <br>
        frequent intervals, THC can accumulate in fatty tissues
        in the human<br>
        body where it may remain for considerable periods of
        time. The health<br>
        significance of this fact is unclear. The storage of
        cannabinoids <br>
        would be serious cause for concern if THC were a highly
        toxic <br>
        substance which remained physiologically active while
        stored in body<br>
        fat. The evidence that THC is a highly toxic substance is
        weak and its<br>
        degree of activity while stored has not been
        investigated. One <br>
        potential health implication of THC storage is that
        stored<br>
        cannabinoids could be released into blood, producing a
        &quot;flashback&quot;, <br>
        although this is likely to be a very rare event, if it
        occurs at all.<br>
        Whatever the uncertainties about health implications of
        THC storage, <br>
        all potential users of cannabis should be aware that it
        occurs. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Increases in the potency of cannabis? <br>
        <br>
        It has been claimed that the existing medical literature
        on the health<br>
        effects of cannabis underestimates its adverse effects,
        because it was<br>
        based upon research conducted on less potent forms of
        marijuana than<br>
        became available in the USA in the past decade. This
        claim has been<br>
        repeated and interpreted in an alarmist fashion in the
        popular media<br>
        on the assumption that an increase in the THC potency of
        cannabis <br>
        necessarily means a substantial increase in the health
        risks of <br>
        cannabis use. <br>
        <br>
        It is far from established that the average THC potency
        of cannabis <br>
        products has substantially increased over recent decades.
        If potency <br>
        has increased, it is even less certain that the average
        health risks<br>
        of cannabis use have materially changed as a consequence,
        since users<br>
        may titrate their dose to achieve the desired effects.
        Even if the<br>
        users are inefficient in titrating their dose of THC, it
        is not clear<br>
        that the probability of all adverse health effects will
        be thereby <br>
        increased. Given the existence of these concerns about
        THC potency, it<br>
        would be preferable to conduct some research on the issue
        rather than<br>
        to rely upon inferences about the likely effects of
        increased cannabis<br>
        potency. Studies of the ability of experienced users to
        titrate their<br>
        dose of THC would contribute to an evaluation of this
        issue.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        A comparative appraisal of health risks: alcohol, tobacco
        and cannabis<br>
        use<br>
        <br>
        The probable and possible adverse health and
        psychological effects of<br>
        cannabis need to be placed in comparative perspective to
        be fully <br>
        appreciated. A useful standard for such a comparison is
        what is known<br>
        about the health effects of alcohol and tobacco, two
        other widely used<br>
        psychoactive drugs. Cannabis shares with tobacco, smoking
        as the usual<br>
        route of administration, and resembles alcohol in being
        used for its<br>
        intoxicating and euphoriant effects. Although allowance
        has to be made<br>
        for the very different prevalence of use of the two
        drugs, and for the<br>
        fact that we know a great deal more about the adverse
        effects of<br>
        alcohol and tobacco use, the comparison serves the useful
        purpose of<br>
        reminding us of the risks we currently tolerate with our
        favourite <br>
        psychoactive drugs. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Acute effects<br>
        <br>
        Alcohol. The major risks of acute cannabis use are
        similar to the<br>
        acute risks of alcohol intoxication in a number of
        respects. First, <br>
        both drugs produce psychomotor and cognitive impairment,
        especially of<br>
        memory and planning. The impairment produced by alcohol
        increases <br>
        risks of various kinds of accident, and the likelihood of
        engaging in<br>
        risky behaviour, such as dangerous driving, and unsafe
        sexual <br>
        practices. It remains to be determined whether cannabis
        intoxication <br>
        produces similar increases in accidental injury and
        death, although on<br>
        the balance of probability it does.<br>
        <br>
        Second, there is good evidence that substantial doses of
        alcohol taken<br>
        during the first trimester of pregnancy can produce a
        foetal alcohol <br>
        syndrome. There is suggestive but far from conclusive
        evidence that<br>
        cannabis used during pregnancy may have similar adverse
        effects. <br>
        <br>
        Third, there is a major health risk of acute alcohol use
        that is not<br>
        shared with cannabis. In large doses alcohol can cause
        death by <br>
        asphyxiation, alcohol poisoning, cardiomyopathy and
        cardiac infarct, <br>
        whereas there are no recorded cases of fatalities
        attributable to<br>
        cannabis.<br>
        <br>
        Tobacco. The major acute health risks that cannabis share
        with tobacco<br>
        are the irritant effects of smoke upon the respiratory
        system, and the<br>
        stimulating effects of both THC and nicotine on the
        cardiovascular <br>
        system, both of which can be detrimental to persons with<br>
        cardiovascular disease.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Chronic effects<br>
        <br>
        Alcohol. There are a number of risks of heavy chronic
        alcohol use,<br>
        some of which may be shared by chronic cannabis use.
        First, heavy use<br>
        of either drug increases the risk of developing a
        dependence syndrome <br>
        in which users experience difficulty in stopping or
        controlling their<br>
        use. There is strong evidence for such a syndrome in the
        case of<br>
        alcohol and reasonable evidence in the case of cannabis.
        A major <br>
        difference between the two is that it is uncertain
        whether a<br>
        withdrawal syndrome reliably occurs after dependent
        cannabis users <br>
        abruptly stop their cannabis use, whereas the abrupt
        cessation of<br>
        alcohol use in severely dependent drinkers produces a
        well defined <br>
        withdrawal syndrome which can be potentially fatal. <br>
        <br>
        Second, there is reasonable clinical evidence that the
        chronic heavy<br>
        use of alcohol can produce psychotic symptoms and
        psychoses in some<br>
        individuals. There is suggestive evidence that chronic
        heavy cannabis <br>
        use may produce a toxic psychosis, precipitate psychotic
        illnesses in<br>
        predisposed individuals, and exacerbate psychotic
        symptoms in <br>
        individuals with schizophrenia.<br>
        <br>
        Third, there is good evidence that chronic heavy alcohol
        use can <br>
        indirectly cause brain injury - the Wernicke-Korsakov
        syndrome - with<br>
        symptoms of severe memory defect and an impaired ability
        to plan and<br>
        organise. With continued heavy drinking, and in the
        absence of vitamin<br>
        supplementation, this injury may produce severe
        irreversible cognitive <br>
        impairment. There is good reason for concluding that
        chronic cannabis <br>
        use does not produce cognitive impairment of comparable
        severity. <br>
        There is suggestive evidence that chronic cannabis use
        may produce <br>
        subtle defects in cognitive functioning, that may or may
        not be <br>
        reversible after abstinence. <br>
        <br>
        Fourth, there is reasonable evidence that chronic heavy
        alcohol use<br>
        produces impaired occupational performance in adults, and
        lowered <br>
        educational achievements in adolescents. There is at most
        suggestive <br>
        evidence that chronic heavy cannabis use produces
        similar, albeit more<br>
        subtle impairments in occupational and educational
        performance of<br>
        adults. <br>
        <br>
        Fifth, there is good evidence that chronic, heavy alcohol
        use <br>
        increases the risk of premature mortality from accidents,
        suicide and<br>
        violence. There is no comparable evidence for chronic
        cannabis use,<br>
        although it is likely that dependent cannabis users who
        frequently <br>
        drive while intoxicated with cannabis increase their risk
        of<br>
        accidental injury or death.<br>
        <br>
        Sixth, alcohol use has been accepted as a contributory
        cause of cancer<br>
        of the oropharangeal organs in men and women. There is
        suggestive <br>
        evidence that chronic cannabis smoking may also be a
        contributory <br>
        cause of cancers of the aerodigestive tract (i.e. the
        mouth, tongue, <br>
        throat, oesophagus, lungs).<br>
        <br>
        Tobacco. The major adverse health effects shared by
        chronic cannabis <br>
        and tobacco smokers are chronic respiratory diseases,
        such as chronic<br>
        bronchitis, and probably, cancers of the aerodigestive
        tract. The<br>
        increased risk of cancer in the respiratory tract is a
        consequence of<br>
        the shared route of administration by smoking. It is
        possible that<br>
        chronic cannabis smoking also shares the cardiotoxic
        properties of<br>
        tobacco smoking, although this possibility remains to be
        investigated. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Implications for harm reduction <br>
        <br>
        Anyone who wishes to avoid the probable acute and chronic
        adverse <br>
        health effects of cannabis should abstain from using the
        drug. This<br>
        advice is especially pertinent for persons with any of
        the diseases <br>
        (e.g. cardiovascular) or conditions (e.g. pregnancy)
        which would make<br>
        them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of cannabis. <br>
        <br>
        Current cannabis users should be aware of the following
        risks of using<br>
        the drug. First, the risk of being involved in a motor
        vehicle <br>
        accident is likely to be increased when cannabis users
        drive while <br>
        intoxicated by cannabis. The combination of alcohol and
        cannabis <br>
        intoxication will substantially increase this risk.
        Second, the <br>
        chronic smoking of cannabis poses significant risks to
        the respiratory <br>
        system, apart from any specific effects of THC. Third,
        the respiratory <br>
        risks of cannabis smoking are amplified if deep
        inhalation and <br>
        breath-holding are used to maximise the absorption of THC
        in the <br>
        lungs. This technique greatly increases the delive<br>
        1. Summary of repo<br>
        particulate matter and tar. Fourth, daily or near daily
        use of <br>
        cannabis is to be avoided, as it has a high risk of
        producing <br>
        dependence. <br>
