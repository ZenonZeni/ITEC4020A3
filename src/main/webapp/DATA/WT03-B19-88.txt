Confessions of a Cybergimp

On the Internet, nobody knows if you have a disability - unless you disclose it.
</H3>


<P>

	</I>

<P>
Last April, I went to a snowbound, isolated cabin in the Sierras to spend a whole 
weekend with 15 people I had never seen before.

<P>
Oh, I'd met them before - I'd just never seen them. Over the previous 
few months we'd argued about politics and religion, flirted, gossiped, 
exchanged dumb jokes, bared our souls, and generally hung out together. 
But I'd never seen their faces, nor they mine.

<P>
Until that weekend, the only things I knew about them had come from the 
notes they had been posting to the Internet. At least once a day - more often, 
several times a day - I would log on to the net, check my e-mail, 
and read the notes that had been posted to various newsgroups (basically a 
much larger, worldwide version of the local electronic bulletin board). 
After reading and responding to enough notes, I began to feel as if I 
knew many of the newsgroup ''regulars'' as well as, if not better than, 
many of the people I know in person. And after that it didn't take long for me, 
and the other members of this ''virtual community,'' to feel a desire to meet each 
other in what we'd begun referring to, in ironic tones, as ''real life.''

<P>
So we picked a weekend. One of us offered the use of his grandparents' cabin 
in the mountains. We deliberately selected a weekend late in April so as to 
miss the last of the winter weather, whereupon Mother Nature proceeded to 
grace the area with 10 inches of snow instead.

<P>
Instead of ruining the weekend, though, the snow only made it more special. 
We drank a lot. We played Yahtzee. We became embroiled in heated political and 
philosophical discussions of the same sort we'd been having on the net, only 
with real facial expressions and tones of voice to add emotion to our words. 
We drank a lot. We jokingly elected one of our number to be our official 
Congressional candidate when she became old enough. We played hearts. 
We discussed whether the '80s hit song ''Turning Japanese'' was about 
masturbation (the verdict: yes). At 3 o'clock in the morning a few of us 
went tobogganing. The rest of us ... well, we drank a lot.

<P>
This went on for a whole weekend, and not once did I pick up any of the 
awkward vibes I usually detect from ABs when they meet me for the first time - this, 
even though I was the only Gimp in the bunch. No one addressed me in baby-talk, 
no one told me what an inspiration I was, and best of all, no one made a fool 
of himself or herself by trying too hard not to offend me. Of course, my disability 
didn't exactly come as a surprise to them - I had been quite open about it in my 
posts to the newsgroup, making reference to it whenever I considered it appropriate. 
In fact, hardly a day went by where I didn't remind them of it.

<P>
Did I mention that we drank a lot?

<P>
There has been much written recently about the so-called Information Revolution 
and how it is affecting the way we work, communicate, participate in the democratic 
process, and so on. Less heralded, but potentially far more profound, are the changes 
being wrought in the social realm. As the Information Age progresses, we may come to 
possess a wholly altered view of what a ''community'' is and how the members of that 
community socialize.

<P>
On the Internet, most socializing takes place on the newsgroups, 
which collectively go by the name of Usenet. Originally, Usenet had only a few 
newsgroups, used mainly by scientists, academics, and other research-oriented types 
to share information and discuss issues related to their fields.

<P>
But the number of people with access to the net has steadily increased, beginning 
with college students, and continuing with subscribers to online services such as 
Delphi, America Online, and Prodigy. There has also been an explosion in the number 
of commercial Internet service providers, which offer direct access to the net for a 
monthly fee. Most provide the same features available at university sites, while 
others have additional features available only to their own users, who are insulated 
from outsiders by a ''firewall'' - in networking terminology, a one-way security 
barrier that prevents other systems from accessing the one being protected.

<P>
As the number of users has grown, the size of Usenet has grown as well. 
Today numbering in the thousands, the newsgroups range from the earnest 
<A HREF = "news:soc.rights.human">(soc.rights.human)</A> 
to the irreverent <A HREF = "news:alt.pave.the.earth">(alt.pave.the.earth),</A> 
from the scientific <A HREF = "news:sci.physics">(sci.physics)</A> 
to the just plain weird <A HREF = "news:alt.religion.kibology>(alt.religion.kibology</A> 
- dedicated to a person with the screen name of ''Kibo'' who has become the 
tongue-in-cheek God of the Net because, well, because things like that happen 
on the net). There are groups for specific ethnicities 
<A HREF = "news:soc.culture.african-american">(soc.culture.african-american),</A> 
age groups <A HREF = "news:alt.society.generation-x">(alt.society.generation-x</A> 
- one of my favorites), artistic interests 
<A HREF = "news:rec.arts.books">(rec.arts.books),</A> 
and sexual proclivities <A HREF = "news:alt.sex.bondage">(alt.sex.bondage),</A> 
as well as groups for those who want to talk about their favorite TV shows 
<A HREF = "news:alt.tv.simpsons">(alt.tv.simpsons)</A> 
or their least favorite 
<A HREF = "news:alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die">(alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die).</A>

<P>
In short, there is a newsgroup out there to tickle - or inflame - just about anyone.

<P>
To make the net even more bewildering for newcomers, or ''newbies,''  the name of 
a group may actually say nothing about the majority of notes posted to it. 
A group's regulars may have been posting to it for a year or more - practically 
forever, in the elongated time frame of the net - and they most likely have 
come to regard it not as a forum for discussing designated subjects, but 
rather as a place where they can hang out and shoot the bull with people 
they consider good friends regardless of whether they've ever physically 
met them. In these cases, the newsgroup has evolved into more than a simple 
electronic bulletin board and has taken on many of the features of an actual
 human community. It doesn't matter that the community has no physical 
location; its members can live hundreds of miles apart, even on different 
continents, and still feel ''close'' to each other.

<P>
In my two years on the net, I have made more new friends than I did in 
the previous ten. I have seen people become engaged after first meeting on 
the net, too. All this has made it easy for me to envision a future in which 
social interaction has become totally independent of geographic proximity.

<P>
It's also made me wonder what this future has in store for people with disabilities. 
As far as I can tell, that future is uncertain. We Gimps may find ourselves liberated 
by the net, or we may find ourselves, once again, imprisoned by it.

<P>
Historically, one of the most oppressive aspects of life as a disabled person 
has been social isolation. In ''Isolation: Confronting The Painful Social 
Realities That Come With Disability'' (MAINSTREAM, September '93), Carol 
Gill writes, ''Those of us disabled since childhood have had a long exposure 
to the social isolation of disability. Some of us remember being sent from 
our 'regular' classrooms for 'special' separate services, or never being 
chosen by classmates for inclusion in sports or parties. We may have grown 
up in inaccessible homes and neighborhoods that thwarted our involvement in 
community activities. Some of us were cloistered in 'schools for the 
handicapped' or institutions.'' Gill, a psychologist, goes on to document 
the harmful effects this sort of isolation can have on a disabled person's 
social development.

<P>
When viewed in the light of this kind of experience, the evolution of 
''virtual communities'' seems like a godsend. On Usenet, communication 
is text-only - the reader of a note has no way of knowing anything personal 
about the author unless the author supplies it. Gone are those prejudgments, 
both conscious and unconscious, that people make when they see a Gimp coming 
toward them. On the net, people ''see'' only what others want them to see - 
so unless the rest of the net becomes aware of one's disability, that 
disability (in a ''virtual'' sense) doesn't exist.

<P>
Even many ABs recognize the disabled presence on the net. A co-author of 
	<I>The Internet for Dummies</I> 
writes, ''Physical disabilities don't matter - I correspond with several 
people who are blind or deaf. If they hadn't felt like telling me, I'd never have known.''

<P>
What a wonderful boon for the Gimp community, isn't it? Centuries of social 
ostracism wiped away with a modem and an e-mail address - right?

<P>
It's not working out that way.

<P>
I know from my own experience that there are a lot of Gimps on the net. 
I'm very open about my disability, and I've gotten in plenty of arguments 
over the ADA, the euthanasia movement, the portrayal of Gimps in movies and 
on TV, the implications of prenatal genetic testing, and other issues of 
concern to disabled people. As a result, I get a lot of private e-mail, 
cheering me on and telling me how cool it is that someone ''like us'' is 
willing to speak out. I'm flattered, obviously, but it makes me uncomfortable, 
too - first, because I hate being perceived as a spokesperson for anyone other 
than myself, and second, because I'd rather have these other Gimps talk about 
their disabilities publicly rather than hide behind their computer screens. 
When I suggest that they do so, however, I'm met with either dead silence 
or a reluctance bordering on fear.

<P>
We're becoming isolated once again, I'm afraid. Worse still, this time 
the isolation is self-imposed.

<P>
The only places on the net where Gimps seem uninhibited are where other 
Gimps gather. Of all the groups on Usenet, there is only one 
<A HREF = "news:misc.handicap">(misc.handicap)</A> 
devoted to general issues concerning the disabled. Moreover, misc.handicap 
is moderated, meaning that the notes are screened by someone before being 
posted to the group at large. This helps to keep the discussions civil, but 
it also deprives them of the spontaneity and wildness that prevails elsewhere 
on the net - and that wildness is part of the fun.

<P>
The communities on the net are chaotic, unpredictable places. The language 
is coarse, with old words taking on new meanings. (On one of the newsgroups 
I frequent, the word ''moose'' has come to be synonymous with gay or lesbian. 
It would take a whole book to explain how and why it happened.) Conversations 
on health-care reform or Hegelian philosophy occur side-by-side with others 
about Monty Python or Dungeons and Dragons. And because those conversations 
take place without the facial expressions and other cues that convey shades 
of meaning in everyday discourse, the emotional content of the words themselves 
is heightened. People regularly fling insults - or ''flames'' - at each other, 
and all-out ''flamewars'' break out without warning.

<P>
It's understandable how an average disabled person might be intimidated by 
the freewheeling atmosphere; to varying degrees, our social opportunities 
have been limited because of our disabilities, and many of us are unsure of 
how well-equipped they are to interact with others in ''real life,'' much less 
on the net. Conditioned to expect rejection, they may try to conceal their 
disabilities from their new ''netfriends'' and thereby gain equal acceptance 
that way. Or so they hope.

<P>
But what happens when the time comes to venture forth into the flesh-and-blood 
world and meet, up close, some of the people they've gotten to know so well 
from a distance? That's what happened with me, at least - in contrast to the 
stereotype of the computer geek who's content to sit at his keyboard and never 
leave his room, I've found myself eager to meet my netfriends in person. I can 
only imagine what I'd do if I hadn't been open about my disability from the get-go. 
I'd either be forced to come out of the closet (to use a ''moose'' metaphor), 
keep mum about it and go to meet my netfriends carrying the same fear of 
rejection I've always had, or shrink from the opportunity and thereby reject 
them before they have the chance to reject me.

<P>
I prefer doing what I can to make the word ''Gimp'' a part of net slang. 
(I'll finally be convinced that there's a true Gimp presence on the net when 
one of us - I hope it's me - receives e-mail from Kibo.) By all rights, there 
should be legions of Gimps raising pluperfect hell from one end of the net to 
the other - because, weirdly enough, in the midst of all the anarchy on the net, 
people do connect and communities do form. And I'll be damned if I'm going to be 
left disconnected again.

<P>
So yes, maybe the Information Age will see people with disabilities shattering 
a history of isolation. But it won't until enough of us have smashed the 
firewalls that we've built for ourselves first.
