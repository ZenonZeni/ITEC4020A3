<h3>PREFACE</h3>
To be meaningful, research must respond to the needs of the community it is meant to serve, and the focus of research must evolve as that community's priorities change.  The  Division of Innovation and Development (DID), the research and development arm of the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), has taken up this challenge by
supporting closer relationships between research and practice, exchanging findings and needs with broader audiences, encouraging the development of projects in key areas, and providing direct service to researchers and users.<P>
          
The work and achievements of DID have helped pioneer many common practices found in classrooms today.  For example, the Division was one of the first agencies to fund research on cooperative learning and on the effects of early childhood intervention.  The Division also has funded seminal work in reciprocal teaching, direct instruction, peer tutoring, learning strategies, and behavioral interventions that have led to dozens of strategies with greater success and enhanced efficiencies for children and youth with
disabilities.  In fact, the Division's R&D efforts have touched on virtually every aspect of teaching and learning, from exploring the influences of parents and families on learning to teacher planning; from psychosocial development to outcomes-based learning; and
from understanding how to best use technology in classrooms to exploring how students use their own language and communication systems to learn.  The Division has taken on many of the biggest research challenges facing education today, with results that continue to reshape how educators, policy makers, and the public think about teaching and learning. <P>
          
DID is responsible for four discretionary programs, funded at nearly $40 million in fiscal year 1995 and authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). A brief description of each program is provided below:<P>
          
<ul> <li>
<b><i>Research ($20.6 million)</b></i>.  Authorized by Part E of IDEA, The Research in Education of Individuals with Disabilities Program provides support to advance and improve the knowledge base and improve the practice of professionals, parents, and others providing early intervention, special education, and related services including professionals in regular education environments to provide children with disabilities effective instruction and enable these children to learn successfully. <P>
          
<li><b><i>Technology, Educational Media, and Materials ($10.8 million)</b></i>.
Authorized by Part G of IDEA, the Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals with Disabilities Program supports projects and centers for advancing the availability, quality, use, and effectiveness of technology, educational media, and materials in the education of children and youth with disabilities and the provision of related services and early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities.
<P>

<li><b><i>Serious Emotional Disturbance ($4.1 million)</b></i>. Authorized by Part C of IDEA, the Program for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance supports projects designed to improve special education and related services to children and youth with serious emotional disturbance. <p>

Types of projects that may be supported under the program include, but are not limited to, research, development, and demonstration projects.  Funds may also be used to develop and demonstrate approaches to assist and prevent children with emotional and
behavioral problems from developing serious emotional disturbance. <P>
               
<li><b><i>Special Studies ($3.9 million)</b></i>.Authorized by Part B of IDEA, the Special Studies Program supports the collection of data, studies, investigations, and evaluations to assess the impact and effectiveness of programs and projects assisted under IDEA. <P>
               
Over the last decade, DID has supported ongoing changes in special and general education and efforts to support knowledge production and use as well as knowledge access.  DID has moved toward an agenda that focuses on results achieving better outcomes for children and youth with disabilities.  This transformation was motivated by a commitment of DID leadership to assure that the research knowledge in which they have heavily invested is accessed and used by practitioners and policy makers to improve their practices, programs, and policies.  This directory of project abstracts will provide an overview of the ongoing efforts of researchers supported by DID who are helping to advance DID's results-oriented mission.</ul><p>
