<H3><b><I><CENTER>Exceptional Child Education Resources (ECER)
Database </CENTER></b></I></h3>

<B><I>What is ECER?</B></I><BR>
Exceptional Child Education Resources (ECER) is the world's most comprehensive
database of resources in special education and gifted education.  ECER contains more
than 80,000 citations and abstracts of print and nonprint materials dealing with the
education and development of people of all ages with exceptionalities--those who have
disabilities and those who are gifted.  Resources in all areas of special education and
related services (including services provided by audiologists, speech therapists,
occupational therapists, physical therapists, and educational psychologists) are covered
in ECER. <P>

ECER covers all types of exceptionalities, including giftedness; talent (artistic
giftedness); creativity; physical disabilities; hearing and visual impairments; mental
retardation/developmental disabilities; learning disabilities; behavior disorders/emotional
disturbances; mental disorders; autism; speech and communication disorders; chronic
illnesses (medically fragile); special health problems (e.g., eating disorders, cancer,
AIDS); child abuse and neglect; and children "at risk" due to disabilities, physical or
psychological problems, minority/ethnic status, or family or environmental factors. 
ECER dates from 1966 to present, and is updated monthly. <P>

<B><I>Is the ECER Database Like the ERIC Database?</B></I><BR>
The ECER database is compatible with the ERIC database.  ECER and ERIC use the
same cataloging, indexing, and abstracting rules and authorities. And ECER descriptors
are taken from the <i>Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors</I>, which allows similar
strategies in searching the two databases. <P>

Some overlap exists between the ECER and ERIC databases.  Approximately half of
the database records that go into ECER also appear in ERIC.  This overlap applies
primarily to unpublished documents (curriculum and teaching guides, reports, etc.) and
articles in core special educational journals.   <P>

<B><I>What Are the Differences Between ECER and ERIC?</B></I><BR>
The ECER records that do not appear in ERIC include published books, additional
journal articles, and nonprint materials.  References retrieved in the ERIC database can
be excluded from ECER searches to avoid duplication.<P>

<B><I> How Can I Access the ECER Database?</B></I><BR>
By subscription.  With one economical annual subscription, you can receive ECER on
CD-ROM through SilverPlatter Information, Inc.

On the Internet.  ECER is also available online<br>
