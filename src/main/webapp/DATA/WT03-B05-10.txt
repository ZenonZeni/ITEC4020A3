BELGIUM'S 1997 BUDGET

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BRUSSELS

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
------------------------
1.  THE BELGIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVED THE COALITION'S L997
BUDGET OCTOBER 4 ON A STRAIGHT PARTY VOTE.

THE BUDGET, BASED ON A CONSERVATIVE L997 GROWTH FORECAST
OF 2.1 PERCENT (NET), INCLUDES BF80 BILLION (USDOLS 2.55
BILLION) OF MEASURES AIMED AT CUTTING THE BUDGET DEFICIT
TO 2.9 PERCENT, BELOW THE 3 PERCENT MAASTRICHT CRITERION
FOR EMU.  IT ALSO INCLUDES BF 367 BILLION IN REVENUE
FROM ASSET SALES TO REDUCE THE CUMULATIVE DEBT BY FOUR
PERCENTAGE POINTS TO L27 PERCENT OF GDP BY THE END OF
1997.  PRIMARY FEDERAL SPENDING IS TO BE CUT BY F L7
BILLION, INCLUDING CUTS IN SUBSIDIES TO PUBIC
COMPANIES, IN INTERNATIONAL AID AND MILITARY SENDING.
SOME CUTS ARE MORE REAL THAN OTHERS, THEVAST MAJORITY
HOWEVER INVOLVES CUTS AGAINST BASEINE EXPENDITURE
PROJECTIONS.

2.  SOCIAL SECURTY SPENDING WILL BE CUT BY BF 23
BILLION, INCLUDNG HEALTH CARE SAVINGS, REDUCED CHILD
ALLOWANCE RTES, AND A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE
RETIREMENT AG OF WOMEN TO 65 YEARS (MATCHING THAT FOR
MEN).  EDERAL REVENUES ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY BF
3 BILLION, INCLUDING EXCISE AND PETROL TAX INCREASS,
AS WELL AS TAX CHANGES ON SOME SAVINGS INSTRUMNTS.
WHILE MOST COMMENTATORS THINK THE L997 BUDGT IS A
REALISTIC ONE, THEY ALSO POINT OUT THAT PIME MINISTER
DEHAENE SEEMED UNABLE TO ESCAPE FRO THE DEMANDS OF HIS
COALITION PARTNERS, MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
USE THE SPECIAL POWERS GRANTED IN THE SUMMER ALLOWING
HIM TO BY-PASS PARLIAMENT.  END INTRODUCTION AND
SUMMARY.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
-------------------------

3.  WHILE SOME OF THIS COALITION'S EARLIER BUDGETS ERRED
IN BEING BASED ON OVERLY OPTIMISTIC MACROECONOMIC
ASSUMPTIONS, THIS CANNOT BE SAID FOR THE L997 BUDGET:

-- NET GDP GROWTH L.2 PERCENT IN L996 AND 2.1 PERCENT IN
   L997;
-- INFLATION L.9 PERCENT FOR BOTH L996 AND L997;
-- SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE FOR L997: 4.1 PERCENT;
-- PRIMARY SURPLUS (I.E., NET OF INTEREST EXPENDITURES):
   6 PERCENT OF GDP;
-- TOTAL FEDERAL DEFICIT BF 212 BILLION, I.E., 2.7
   PERCENT OF GDP, TO WHICH THE DEFICITS OF THE SOCIAL
   SECURITY SYSTEM AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE REGIONS AND
   COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE ADDED, BRINGING THE OVERALL
   TOTAL TO 2.9 PERCENT OF GDP.

BOTH THE GDP AND SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES SEEM TO BE
PRUDENT, E.G., THE OECD AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN
COMMISSION USE 2.5 PERCENT NET GROWTH AND 5 PERCENT
SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES IN THEIR FORECASTS FOR
BELGIUM.

SPENDING GROWTH HELD BELOW INFLATION
------------------------------------

4.  OVERALL, THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING
KEY EXPENDITURE FIGURES FOR THE 1997 BUDGET (IN BILLIONS
BF):
                  1996       1997   PCT.  PERCENTAGE OF
                                    INCR.  GDP (1997)
PROGRAM EXPEND.    788.0     811.2   1.2     8.1
SOC. SECURITY    1,492.6   1,514.3   1.4    15.1
INTEREST           668.0     676.4   1.2     6.7
REGIONAL TRANSF.   829.8     886.4   6.8     8.8
EU TRANSFERS        91.2      82.9  -9.2     8.3

TOTAL:           3,869.6   3,971.2   2.6    38.8

5.  INDIVIDUAL BUDGET FIGURES FOR THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES
(E.G. DEFENSE, DEVELOPMENT AID, FOREIGN AFFAIRS) WILL
ONLY BECOME AVAILABLE AROUND NOVEMBER - TOTAL PROGRAM
SPENDING IS BUDGETED TO DECREASE FROM 39.4 PERCENT OF
GDP IN 1996 TO 38.8 PERCENT IN 1997.
-
NEW RECEIPTS
------------

6.  THE TOTAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP WILL BE
MAINTAINED IN L997 AT THE SAME LEVEL AS IN L996 (A
POLITICAL TENET OF THE CHRISTIAN-DEMOCRATIC COALITION
PARTNERS).  NEW FISCAL MEASURES ARE INCLUDED IN THE L997
BUDGET, INCLUDING A BF 7.3 BILLION INCREASE IN PETROL
TAXES, BF 3.7 BILLION EXCISE TAXES ON BEER AND A BF L.2
BILLION TURNOVER TAX LEVIED ON THE BANK'S SMALL SAVINGS
ACCOUNTS HELD BY INDIVIDUALS, AND BF 5.5 BILLION THROUGH
COMBATTING FISCAL FRAUD.  A MORE STRUCTURAL MEASURE IN
THIS CATEGORY IS THE CONTINUED NON-INDEXATION OF TAX
BRACKETS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW.
MOST OF THESE MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CONTINUING
DECLINES IN FISCAL RECEIPTS FROM A REDUCTION IN THE
TOTAL SALARY MASS AND MEASURES SUCH AS A CUT IN
EMPLOYERS' SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION FOR LOWER WAGES.

EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT.AGAIN
-----------------------------

7.  THE BUDGET CONCLAVE PRODUCED BF L7 BILLION IN
EXPENDITURE CUTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES BEING A
REVISED SUBSIDY TO THE POSTAL SYSTEM (BF 5.3 BILLION), A
BF 5.8 BILLION CUT IN THE SUBSIDIES TO PUBLIC COMPANIES,
A BF L BILLION REDUCTION EACH IN FOREIGN AID AND DEFENSE
(FROM BF 98 BILLION TO BF 97 BILLION), AND A BF L
BILLION FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR NUCLEAR WASTE.
PUBLIC INVESTMENT WAS ALSO CUT BY BF 700 MILLION,
BRINGING IT TO ONLY L.5 PERCENT OF GDP, LESS THAN HALF
THE EUROPEAN UNION AVERAGE.  THIS MEANS THAT SUCCESSIVE
BELGIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE REDUCED THEIR PUBLIC
INVESTMENTS BY TWO-THIRDS SINCE THE LATE SEVENTIES, AND
BY 50 PERCENT SINCE THE EARLY EIGHTIES.  NEVERTHELESS,
THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE SOME ROOM FOR EXTRA EXPENDITURES,
SUCH AS A BF 2.5 BILLION INCREASE IN THE JUSTICE
MINISTRY BUDGET (TIED TO THE REFORM OF BELGIUM'S JUSTICE
SYSTEM) AND A BF 2 BILLION (OVER 4 YEARS) INCREASE IN
AIRBUS SUBSIDIES.

SOCIAL SECURITY
---------------

8.  THE L997 CUTS MAINLY AFFECT HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES
(BF L9.6 BILLION) AND UNEMPLOYMENT (BF 2.5 BILLION).
OTHER MEASURES REFORMING DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE
SYSTEM SUCH AS FAMILY ALLOWANCES AND PENSIONS ARE FAR
MORE MODEST IN L997, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE
STRONGER IMPACT IN LATER YEARS, TOTALLING BF 34 BILLION
(IN L997 FRANCS) BY THE YEAR 2000.  YET, IT IS HERE THAT
THE COALITION SEEMS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED MOST OF ITS
DIFFICULTIES, CAUSING A DELAY BY ALMOST TWO MONTHS IN
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE L997 BUDGET.  (ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENT DID MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF
OCTOBER 1, THE DRAFT BUDGET FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS
TRADITIONALLY FINALIZED BY THE END OF JULY). THE DEHAENE
GOVERNMENT HAD ASKED FOR AND OBTAINED SPECIAL POWERS
ALLOWING IT TO BYPASS PARLIAMENT ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF A
STRUCTURAL REFORM OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, BUT THE
COALITION REMAINS GRIDLOCKED OVER FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES
SUCH AS REFORMING THE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS, TAXING
FAMILY ALLOWANCES, AND MAKING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MORE
LIMITED IN TIME.

DEBT MANAGEMENT
---------------

9.  A 4 PERCENTAGE POINT GDP DECREASE IN THE CUMULATIVE
DEBT/GDP RATIO WILL BE ACHIEVED IN L997 MAINLY THROUGH A
REDUCTION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT, PAID FOR BY THE
SALE OF EXTRA GOLD BY THE NATIONAL BANK OF BELGIUM (NBB)
(BF 222 BILLION) AND A CONTINUED SALE OF PUBLIC ASSETS
IN ENTERPRISES SUCH AS CREDIT COMMUNAL, THE MUNICIPALLY
OWNED BANK, AND ASLK-CGER, THE BANK AND INSURANCE
COMPANY (BF 70 BILLION IN ALL).  ANOTHER BF 75 BILLION
IS SUPPOSED TO COME FROM A MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF
PUBLIC ASSETS (E.G., INVESTING THEM IN BONDS RATHER THAN
PLACING THEM WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS).  THUS, THE
BELGIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE CUMULATIVE
DEBT FROM L37 TO L27 PERCENT OF GDP IN FIVE YEARS TIME.
BY MAINTAINING A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVEL OF PRIMARY
SURPLUS, IT WILL ACHIEVE A STEADY DECREASE OF THE
DEBT/GDP RATIO, WHEREBY MORE AND MORE ROOM WILL BECOME
AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAM (I.E., NON-INTEREST) GOVERNMENT
EXPENDITURE, AND THE PUBLIC DEBT WILL BE REDUCED TO 60
PERCENT OF GDP OVER AN ACCEPTABLE PERIOD OF TIME.

COMMENTS
--------

10.  ACCORDING TO DEHAENE'S ECONOMIC CHIEF OF STAFF,
THIS IS THE BUDGET WHICH IS POLITICALLY MOST ACCEPTABLE
AT THE MOMENT.  ANYTHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL, SUCH AS A
DRASTIC REFORM OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME SPAN.  THE
SPECIAL BUDGET POWERS EXPIRE IN JULY 1997, BUT ALREADY
BY APRIL 1997 FOR SOCIAL SECURITY.  HENCE, THE
INEVITABLE REFORM OF THE CIVIL SERVICE PENSION SYSTEM
MAY HAVE BEEN POSTPONED FOR NOW, BUT 'SOMETHING' NEEDS
TO BE DONE BEFORE EASTER 1997, SINCE IT IS TREATED AS A
SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUE FIRST, AND ONLY THEN AS A BUDGET
PROBLEM.

11.  PETER PRAET, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE GENERALE DE
BANQUE, MORE OR LESS CONFIRMS THIS VIEW, WHEN HE CALLED
THE BUDGET "POLITICALLY VERY BALANCED".  HE COMMENTED
THAT IT NEEDED TO BE POLITICALLY MORE UNBALANCED TO
ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS.  PRAET POINTS OUT THAT
TWO-THIRDS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT CAN BE
ATTRIBUTED TO STRUCTURAL FACTOR REASONS, SUCH AS THE
FACT THAT THE BELGIAN ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY GROWING BELOW
ITS GROWTH POTENTIAL.  MOST OUTSIDE OBSERVERS AGREE THAT
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTED WISELY BY STARTING FROM
VERY CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS, THAT THERE ARE FEWER STOP
AND GO MEASURES IN THIS BUDGET THAN BEFORE, AND THAT
MANY OF THE MORE STRUCTURAL EFFORTS WILL HAVE A
BENEFICIAL LONG TERM EFFECT.

12.  THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TRIES TO PRESENT ITSELF IN
ITS BEST POSSIBLE SHAPE BEFORE THE START OF EMU.  IT
WILL STILL NEED A POLITICAL DELIBERATION TO MAKE THE EMU
GRADE CONCERNING CUMULATIVE DEBT, BUT BY SHOWING
'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS' IN THAT FIELD TOO (FROM 137 TO
127 PERCENT OF GDP), IT WILL AT LEAST HAVE CONFORMED TO
THE LANGUAGE (IF NOT THE SPIRIT) OF THE MAASTRICHT
TREATY.

NEW ZEALAND: TWO FERRIES PURCHASE UPDATE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in WELLINGTON

It has been public knowledge for at least two years that Tranz
Rail (formerly known as New Zealand Rail) has been considering
upgrading two of its ferries servicing the Cook Strait between
New Zealand's North and South Islands.  The company has now
confirmed its intentions to replace two of its existing ferries
with two new ships by the year 2000.  Each new ferry will carry
between 750 and 1,000 people as well as cars and cargo.  The
ferries will be roll-on, roll-off in design.  Tranz Rail's ferry
upgrade is part of a pending NZ$485 million (US$330 million)
expenditure plan to take place over the next seven years.

It is an almost certainty that Tranz Rail will appoint a European
shipbuilder to this project.  Negotiations are currently taking
place with four European shipbuilders.  In a phone conversation
with the U.S. Commercial Service in Wellington, a spokesman for
the company explained that a number of U.S. shipbuilders were
approached for this project but not one was interested due to the
"roll-on, roll-off" requirement.  Further, "that any U.S.
companies specializing in maritime electronic systems would be
most likely working with those shipbuilders".

Further information on this major project should be directed to:

VIETNAM: DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR IMPORTED GOODS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   UNLESS LICENSE TO DO SO BY THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND
INVESTMENT (MPI) UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LEGISLATION (FIL),
FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN TRADE
IN VIETNAM, OTHER THAN THE DIRECT MARKETING OF GOODS THEY HAVE
MANUFACTURED IN VIETNAM.  ACCORDINGLY, A FOREIGN COMPANY THAT
WANTS TO SELL AND MARKET ITS GOODS IN VIETNAM MUST DO SO
INDIRECTLY BY APPOINTING A LOCAL AGENT OR DISTRIBUTOR TO
FACILITATE BOTH IMPORTATION INTO AND MARKETING WITHIN VIETNAM.

2.   CURRENT REGULATIONS ON SALES AGENTS DO NOT ADDRESS THE CASE
WHERE GOODS ARE FROM A FOREIGN SUPPLIER.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE
STATUS OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAIN RULES AND THE
CONTRACT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
THE MINISTRY OF TRADE HAS PROPOSED A DRAFT LAW THAT WOULD
REGULATE THOSE VIETNAMESE ENTITIES WHICH CAN ACT AS A SALES AGENT
OR DISTRIBUTOR FOR FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT WANT TO SELL THEIR
GOODS IN VIETNAM.

3.   THE MAIN RISK ARISING FROM THE GAP IN THE CURRENT
REGULATIONS IS THE RISK OF NON-PAYMENT. AS A SECURITY MEASURE TO
THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL, SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED AS
DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THE DISTRIBUTOR BUYS THE GOODS
DIRECTLY FROM THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL.  IN THE CASE OF AN AGENCY
AGREEMENT, THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL BEARS THE RISK SINCE THE AGENT
IS ONLY SELLING THE GOODS ON THE FOREIGN COMPANY'S BEHALF.
DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED AS "FOREIGN TRADE
CONTRACTS" AND SHOULD BE LODGED WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRADE.  IN
ANY CASE, THE EXPORTER SHOULD OBTAIN LEGAL ADVICE WHEN PREPARING
OR ENTERING INTO ANY SALES AGREEMENT WITH A VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR.

4.   IMPORTING:  IN AN EFFORT TO CONTROL ITS LIMITED FOREIGN
EXCHANGE RESERVES, VIETNAM HAS STRINGENT CONTROLS ON THE IMPORTS
OF FINISHED GOODS.  ONE FORM OF CONTROL IS THE REQUIREMENT TO USE
AN IMPORT-EXPORT COMPANY AUTHORIZED BY THE MINISTRY OF TRADE.  IN
1995, ABOUT 1,250 COMPANIES HAVE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TRADING
LICENSES TO IMPORT OR EXPORT DIRECTLY, OF WHICH ONLY NINE PERCENT
OF THE TOTAL NUMBER ARE PRIVATE FIRMS.   IN MOST CASES, THE
VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR WILL NEED TO PAY AN AUTHORIZED
TRADING COMPANY TO IMPORT THE GOODS.  THE AUTHORIZED TRADING
COMPANY WILL ADMINISTER THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING THE IMPORT
LICENSE AND CLEARING THE GOODS THROUGH CUSTOMS.   THE LICENSE IS
APPLIED FOR AFTER THE GOODS ARE SHIPPED, SOMETIMES AFTER THEY
ARRIVE IN VIETNAM.  IN EXCHANGE, THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR
WILL PAY A SERVICE COMMISSION, AVERAGING 2% TO 3% OF THE VALUE OF
THE SHIPMENT.   EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 1996, THE MINISTRY OF TRADE
REVOKED THE REQUIREMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR SHIPMENT TO HAVE AN
IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSE.  HENCE, A LICENSE MAY BE VALID FOR
SEVERAL SHIPMENTS. THE FIRMS CERTIFIED TO IMPORT AND EXPORT,
HOWEVER, ARE LIMITED TO THE RANGE OF COMMODITIES SPECIFIED BY THE
MINISTRY OF TRADE FOR EACH FIRM.  THEREFORE, THE VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR MUST CONFIRM THAT THE IMPORT-EXPORT FIRM HAS
THE PROPER PERMITS TO COVER THE TYPE OF GOODS BEING IMPORTED.

5.   DISTRIBUTION:  ONCE THE GOODS HAVE CLEARED CUSTOMS,
VIETNAMESE COMPANIES WITH IMPORT-EXPORT PRIVILEGES, PRIMARILY
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES,  MAY ALSO ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY AS
WHOLESALERS, AND IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR A U.S. EXPORTER TO SEEK
THESE TYPES OF FIRMS AS AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS.   ALTERNATIVELY,
WITH THE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY, THE FLEDGING PRIVATE ENTERPRISES
HAVE REVITALIZED THE DISTRIBUTION SECTOR.  PRIVATE DISTRIBUTORS
GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE IMPORT RIGHTS AND MUST SECURE THE SERVICES
OF A LICENSED IMPORTER, ALTHOUGH THIS IS SLOWLY CHANGING.  IN
GENERAL, VIETNAMESE DISTRIBUTORS, WHETHER STATE-OWNED OR PRIVATE,
LACK CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE A BASIC RANGE
OF SERVICES:  PROPER WAREHOUSING, INVENTORY AND QUALITY CONTROL,
RELIABLE DELIVERY, MARKETING AND AFTER-SALES SERVICE.  PRIVATE
ENTERPRISES, HOWEVER, TEND TO BE MORE DEXTEROUS AND
BUSINESS-ORIENTED THAN THEIR STATE-RUN COUNTERPARTS.  GIVEN THE
GEOGRAPHIC CONFIGURATION AND POOR INFRASTRUCTURE OF VIETNAM
COUPLED WITH THE LIMITED CAPITALIZATION OF MOST LOCAL
DISTRIBUTORS,  U.S. EXPORTERS MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO HIRE
SEVERAL AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO COVER DIFFERENT AREAS.

6.   MARKETING:   CONSIDERED AS PART OF TRADING SERVICES, FOREIGN
SUPPLIERS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PROVIDE MARKETING AND SERVICES FOR
THEIR PRODUCTS IN VIETNAM.  GIVEN THAT LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS HAVE
LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN STANDARD TECHNIQUES, WITHOUT TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE U.S. EXPORTER, THESE
COMPANIES CANNOT BE RELIED UPON FOR A SUSTAINED MARKETING AND
SALES EFFORT.   MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR
AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO CARRY COMPETING BRANDS.  THEREFORE, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN EFFECTIVE MARKET REPRESENTATION FROM A VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR, FOREIGN SUPPLIERS SHOULD BE PREPARED TO INVEST
IN TRAINING THEIR AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR EITHER BY SENDING TECHNICAL
EXPERTS TO VIETNAM OR SENDING THE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR ABROAD FOR
TRAINING OR BOTH.  SECURING TRAVEL PASSPORTS AND TRAINING VISAS
FOR VIETNAMESE NATIONALS TO GO ABROAD MAY TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS TO
SECURE; HENCE, ADVANCE PLANNING IS REQUIRED.  CONSTANT CONTACT
WITH THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR IS ALSO NECESSARY.  A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP ALLOWS THE FOREIGN SUPPLIER TO KEEP ABREAST OF THE
CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LOCAL MARKET.  CONTACT IS ALSO
NECESSARY TO KEEP THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR MOTIVATED TO
PUSH THE PRODUCT.

7.   REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE:  U.S. EXPORTERS MAY CHOOSE TO
ESTABLISH A PRESENCE IN VIETNAM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL
OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THEIR AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR.  ISSUED BY THE
MINISTRY OF TRADE, A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE LICENSE ALLOWS A U.S.
EXPORTER TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF ITS
PRODUCT IN VIETNAM.   THIS MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR
THOSE PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE EXTENSIVE PROMOTION OR VALUE-ADDED
SERVICES.  THE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE OF THE U.S. EXPORTER MAY
ALSO SUPERVISE SERVICE CENTERS AND SHOWROOMS.   TYPICALLY,
FOREIGN COMPANIES HIRE AND TRAIN LOCAL STAFF TO ACT AS MARKETING
REPRESENTATIVES, WHO THEN OVERSEE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.  A
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE, HOWEVER, IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM
TRADING, RENDERING SERVICES, SUBLEASING ITS OFFICE, OR ANY OTHER
REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES.

8.   INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES:  GIVEN THE POTENTIAL HIGH
COST OF MAINTAINING A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE, U.S. EXPORTERS MAY
CHOOSE TO HAVE A DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES PRESENT IN VIETNAM.  SOME
INTERNATIONAL TRADING FIRMS REPRESENTED IN VIETNAM INCLUDE
CONNELL BROS., DIETHELM, F.E. ZUELLIG, INCHCAPE AND GANNON.
CURRENTLY, INTERNATIONAL TRADING FIRMS ARE LIMITED TO
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE STATUS; HENCE, THE SAME RESTRICTIONS IN THE
AREAS OF TRADING AND SERVICES APPLY.  HOWEVER, THESE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING A
WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AS WELL AS INDUSTRIAL GOODS.
MOREOVER, THEY HAVE EXTENSIVE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE DUE TO THEIR
RELATIVELY LONG TERM PRESENCE IN VIETNAM.   BY WORKING CLOSELY
WITH KEY WHOLESALERS AND DEALERS, THESE FIRMS LIASE DIRECTLY WITH
THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL TO COORDINATE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION.

9.   FOREIGN INVESTMENT LICENSE:  IN THE LONG TERM, THE MOST
EFFECTIVE ROUTE FOR MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING GOODS IN VIETNAM
IS TO INVEST UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW.  THIS OPTION
USUALLY ENTAILS ESTABLISHING A MANUFACTURING OPERATION.  UNDER A
LICENSED FOREIGN INVESTMENT PROJECT, FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE
PERMITTED TO HANDLE THEIR OWN MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR
PRODUCTS MADE IN VIETNAM.  UNDER THIS FORM, A NUMBER OF FOREIGN
FIRMS HAVE RESORTED TO THE CHALLENGING AND COSTLY TASK OF
ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS TO
GAIN GREATER CONTROL ON THE HANDLING OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

10.  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION:  IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE MYRIAD OF
PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, U.S.
EXPORTERS ARE ADVISED TO CONDUCT EXHAUSTIVE DUE DILIGENCE ON
POTENTIAL LOCAL AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE
RELEVANT PERMITS, FACILITIES, MANPOWER, CAPITAL AND OTHER
REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO MEET THEIR ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITIES.
COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS SHOULD CLEARLY DOCUMENT THE RIGHTS AD
OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY AS WELL AS STIPULATIONS FOR DISPUTE
RESOLUTION.

JAPAN: SANITATION MEASURES FOR IMPORTED OYSTERS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in TOKYO

The following memo regarding sanitaion of imported oysters was
distributed to all qurantine stations in Japan by the Japanese
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW).

MHW memo of September 30, 1996

To:       Managers of Quarantine Stations

From:     Director of Veterinary Sanitation Division
          Environmental Health Bureau
          Ministry of Health and Welfare

The importance of food sanitation control has been reconfirmed
since the eruption of nation wide food poisoning since May this
year.  In order to facilitate the safety of raw consumption
oysters, the following memo was distributed to Prefectural
Governments prior to the shipping season of Japanese oysters.
For imported oysters for raw consumption, your assistance in
guiding importers concerning hygienic handling is requested.  In
particular, importers should be requested that oysters imported
for cooked consumption must not be distributed for raw
consumption as indicated in this memo.

Regarding sanitation measures for raw consumption oysters

Purpose:  A number of food poisoning cases, including E. coli O-
157 contamination, has been reported since May, 1996.  Although
no raw consumption oysters have been identified as a carrier of
O-157, a guideline has been established to prevent food poisoning
from raw consumption oysters.  It is requested that Prefectural
and regional authorities of oyster production enhance their food
sanitation control.

Summary of sanitation measures:

I. Prefectural and regional authorities of raw consumption oyster
production should take the following sanitation measures.

1. Control of microorganisms in the oyster growing waters

1)  Periodical water quality testing should be conducted to
confirm the water quality standard:  below 70 MPN of total
coliform group per 100 ml of sea water.

2)  Periodical testing on vero-toxin producing E. coli. (VTEC)
with oyster meat should be conducted.  If test results read
positive on VTEC, shipment from the subject growing waters should
be prohibited.

2. Sanitation control of processing plants

In order to prevent secondary contamination, processing plants
must maintain thorough water sanitation control, health check of
employees, and clean handling of oysters.

3) Product inspection

Processors should maintain periodical product testing for the
oyster product standard (Bacteria:  50,000 counts or below per
one gram and E. Coli:  230 MPN per 100 grams) and VTEC prior to
shipment.

4) Hygienic handling

Processors should confirm the storage standard (storage
temperature of below ten degrees Celsius) and hygienic product
handling to prevent increase of microorganisms.

5) Batch control system

Processors and dealers should confirm the batch control system
with product labels, production management logs, etc. so the
original processors and growing waters can be identified with
already distributed products.

6) When VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution

If VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution, the subject lot
must be disposed, and shipment from the growing water must be
prohibited until the cause is identified and a prevention measure
is adapted.

7) Prevention of mixing with raw consumption oysters and cooked
consumption oysters

A thorough batch control system must be confirmed in order to
prevent distribution of cooked consumption oysters as raw
consumption oysters.

II. Sanitation measures for Prefectures which receive raw
consumption oysters

Prefectures which receive raw consumption oysters should adapt
the following sanitation measures.

1. Confirm sanitation control in distribution

Confirm the storage standard (storage temperature of below ten
degrees Celsius) and clean product handling to prevent increase
of microorganisms.

2. When VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution

1) If VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution, the
Prefectural authority must report the incident to the producing
Prefecture of the oyster and dispose the subject lot.

2) If VTEC is detected from imported oysters, the prefectural
authority must report to the Veterinary Sanitation Division of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare immediately.

FRANCE: EUROPEAN CHILDREN'S WEAR MARKET UPDATE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in PARIS

A study has been published by the company  Management Horizons
Europe  on the European children s wear market.  This study took
into consideration the following factors:  demography, market
size, spendings, distribution networks, and consumers  taste. The
survey reported the following information:

Industry analysts predict that between 1995 and 2005, the
percentage of Europe s population represented by children aged
under 14 years will be as follows:

                    1995           2000           2005

Luxemburg           18.3%          20.9%          20.8%

United Kingdom      19.3%          19.9%          19.5%

Netherlands         18.4%          19.2%          20.0%

France              17.8%          19.2%          18.5%

Belgium             18.0%          18.2%          17.9%

Switzerland         17.8%          17.9%          17.5%

Spain               16.7%          15.3%          15.1%

Germany             16.3%          15.5%          14.4%

Italy               15.1%          14.1%          13.9%

The number of children aged 0 to 14 in Europe is expected to
increase by 1.3% through 2000. However, analysts predict a slight
decrease of 2.3 percent from 2000 to 2005.

The population of children aged 0 to 14 years is anticipated to
grow from 1995 to 2005 in the following countries:

- Netherlands (15.9%)
- Luxemburg (11.2%)
- United Kingdom (4.2%)
- Belgium (1.6%)

For the same period, the same population is expected to decrease
in the following European countries:

- Spain (10%)
- Italy (6.6%)
- Germany (9.4%)

According to market specialists, children aged 2-5 years is the
only share of the population which will certainly increase
between the years 2000 and 2005.

Between 1995 and 2005, the United Kingdom will certainly see an
increase in the number of children aged 6 to 9 years (11.9%), and
10 to 14 years (7.1%).

1995 sales of children s wear by distribution channel were as
follows:

France:
- Hyper/supermarkets:    31.0%
- Mail-order houses:     11.0%
- Specialty stores:      33.0%
- Department stores:      3.0%
- Popular stores:         3.0%
- Independent stores:    13.0%
- Others:                 6.0%

Germany:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     7.0%
- Mail-order houses:     11.5%
- Specialty stores:      30.5%
- Department stores:     12.4%
- Popular stores:
- Independent stores:    29.4%
- Others:                 9.2%

United Kingdom:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     5.0%
- Mail-order houses:      8.0%
- Specialty stores:      25.0%
- Department stores:      8.0%
- Popular stores:        25.0%
- Independent stores:    18.0%
- Others:                11.0%

Italy:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     4.8%
- Mail-order houses:      0.3%
- Specialty stores:      20.9%
- Department stores:     11.6%
- Popular stores:          -
- Independent stores:    53.7%
- Others:                 8.7%

Spain:
- Hyper/supermarkets:    15.8%
- Mail order houses:      0.4%
- Specialty stores:      20.9%
- Department stores:     11.6%
- Popular stores:
- Independent stores:    53.7%
- Others:                 8.7%

Considering the above, independent stores lead in terms of
children s wear sales only in Italy(53.7%) and Spain (49.8%).  In
the other European countries, specialty stores and
hyper/supermarkets are the two main distribution networks.
Specialty stores registered good sales, particularly in the
Netherlands (70%) and Belgium (55%), while sales in
hyper/supermarkets showed  good results in France (31%), followed
by Switzerland (19.1%), and Spain (15.8%).

The study reported that the media have a tremendous impact on
children, particularly in France and The United Kingdom.  Music
and television are influential at an early age, and are thus
excellent means for  promoting products which are specifically
directed towards children.

RAPID GROWTH IN VIETNAM'S COMPUTER SERVICES SECTOR

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OVER 2,000 FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE
OFFICES AND 1,400 FOREIGN JOINT-VENTURES/ 100 PERCENT
FOREIGN-OWNED BUSINESSES HAS SPURRED A GROWING DEMAND FOR
COMPUTER SERVICES IN VIETNAM. CURRENTLY, MANY OF THESE COMPUTER
SERVICE FIRMS ARE MOVING FROM SINGLE STATION PERSONAL COMPUTERS
(PC'S) TO LOCAL NETWORKING AND/OR WIDE AREA NETWORKS. THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF PC'S IN VIETNAM HAS GROWN FROM 40,000 IN 1994 TO OVER
100,000 THIS YEAR. WITH FEW LOCAL AND FOREIGN PROVIDERS OF
COMPUTER SERVICES, DEMAND IS OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY.

2.   IN 1994, THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT DRAFTED ITS NATIONAL PLAN
ON INFORMATICS TECHNOLOGY (IT 2000 MASTERPLAN). IT 2000 DETAILS
THE COUNTRY'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY,
DEFINES PRIORITY IT PROJECTS, SETS NATIONAL STANDARDS AND
OUTLINES POLICIES FOR MOBILIZING CAPITAL. OPEN SYSTEMS ARE NOW
THE ADOPTED STANDARD. SINCE THERE IS NO LEGACY SYSTEM OR STANDARD
IN VIETNAM, THE MARKET WANTS TO START WITH THE BEST AND MOST
RELIABLE PRODUCTS (MAINLY U.S. MADE).

3.   THE MARKET FOR COMPUTER SERVICES IS EXPECTED TO GROW RAPIDLY
WITH THE PLANNED COMPUTERIZATION OF STATE-OWNED BANKING, TELECOM,
ENERGY AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES. ASSISTING THE GOVERNMENT ARE THE
MULTILATERAL DONOR AGENCIES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND $200
MILLION IN CREDITS TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPUTER
SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE
PERCEIVED TO BE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WITH SUPERIOR AFTERSALES
SERVICE.

4.   SERVICES NOW IN GREATEST DEMAND INCLUDE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION,
IT TRAINING, NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND IT CONSULTING. DATA CENTER
DESIGN, COMPUTER DISASTER RECOVERY CENTERS AND OUT-SOURCING ARE
POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, DOMESTIC SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT WILL PLAY AN INCREASING ROLE IN VIETNAM'S IT
INDUSTRY. CURRENTLY, THERE IS A NEED FOR LEGITIMATE LOCALIZATION
OF MANY INTERNATIONAL SOFTWARE PROGRAMS.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: OIL PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS - PRICE RECORD

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE AVERAGE VALUE OF VENEZUELA'S OIL EXPORT BASKET
HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF
1996.  HOWEVER, FOLLOWING U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ
IN SEPTEMBER 1996 WORLD OIL PRICES SHOT UP DRAMATICALLY,
AND VENEZUELA'S OIL BASKET CLOSED AT USDOLS 22.60 PER
BARREL ON OCTOBER 15, 1996.  THIS PRICE IS THE HIGHEST
SINCE 1990 WHEN IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT.  VENEZUELA HAS BEEN
EXCEEDING ITS 2.36 MILLION B/D OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTA.
MANY ANALYSTS BELIEVE VENEZUELA'S EXPORTS ARE CURRENTLY
AVERAGING 3.00 MILION B/D.  VENEZUELA'S OIL EXPORTS ARE
EXPECTED TO INCREASE EVEN FURTHER DURING THE NEXT
SEVERAL YEARS AS MARGINAL FIELDS CONTRACTS, STRATEGIC
ASSOCIATIONS AND EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AGREEMENTS
WITH FOREIGN FIRMS ADD TO PDVSA'S OWN EXPANSION EFFORTS.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: FOREIGN TRADE - NON-OIL EXPORTS UP

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

NON-OIL EXPORTS INCREASED 32.3 PERCENT DURING
AUGUST 1996 TO USD 430 MILLION IN COMPARISON WITH THE
PREVIOUS MONTH.  THIS IS THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE INCREASE
WHICH MARKS AN END TO THE DOWNWARD TREND THAT BEGAN IN
MAY 1996.  HOWEVER, NON-OIL EXPORTS FOR THE PERIOD
JANUARY-AUGUST OF 1996 ARE STILL LOWER (14.7 PERCENT)
THAN THAT REGISTERED DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 1995.
LOWER NON-OIL EXPORTS DURING 1996 CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO
AN OVERVALUED BOLIVAR DURING FIRST QUARTER 1996.

     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

ATTRACTED BY INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN THE VENEZUELAN
ECONOMY.  THE BOLIVAR'S EXCHANGE RATE CLOSED AT BS.
473.00 PER DOLLAR AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, REPRESENTING
AN APRECIATION OF 0.7 PERCENT COMPARED TO THE END OF THE
PREVIOUS MONTH.  THIS APPRECIATION CONTINUED INTO EARLY
OCTOBER, REACHING A PEAK OF BS. 465.25 PER DOLLAR ON
OCTOBER 2.  HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE
FOR SEPTEMBER (BS. 475.84 PER DOLLAR) WAS 0.3 PERCENT

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: BRADY BOND TRANSACTIONS - CHANGE IN DOWNWARD
TREND

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

BRADY BOND TRADING INCREASED 31.3 PERCENT IN
SEPTEMBER, THE FIRST MONTHLY RISE SINCE THE LIFTING OF
EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND DEPRECIATION OF THE BOLIVAR IN
APRIL.  VENEZUELAN BRADY BOND PRICES HAVE BEEN
INCREASING BECAUSE OF THE GOV'S SUCCESSFUL
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGENDA VENEZUELA AND THE RESULTING
IMPROVEMENT IN VENEZUELA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE.
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RISING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES
AND THE GOV'S ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO USE THESE RESERVES
TO REDUCE FOREIGN DEBT (PRIMARILY BRADY BONDS) HAVE ALSO
INCREASED INVESTOR'S EXPECTATIONS THAT THE BRADY BONDS
WILL BE REPAID.  THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN
COMING MONTHS CONTRIBUTING TO AN INCREASE IN BOTH THE
VOLUME AND PRICE OF BRADY BOND TRADING.

RECORD HIGH

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE CAPITALIZATION INDEX
CLOSED AT 5,481.90, INCREASING 19.1 PERCENT COMPARED TO
THE END OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH.  THE INDEX INCREASED TO
RECORD HIGHS IN ELEVEN STRAIGHT DAILY SESSIONS BEGINNING
SEPTEMBER 20.  KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE RECORD
HIGHS ARE LOW DOMESTIC INTEREST RATES AND POSITIVE
EXPECTATIONS OF THE GOV'S PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM WHICH
HAVE ENCOURAGED INVESTORS TO BUY STOCKS IN ANTICIPATION
OF RISING INVESTMENT IN THE CARACAS STOCK MARKET.
AVERAGE STOCK PRICES HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN THREE
TIMES SINCE SEPTEMBER 1995.  STOCK PRICES ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE TO RISE, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER PACE, IN FUTURE
MONTHS AS THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO RECOVER FROM THE CURRENT
RECESSION.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: MONETARY STABILIZATION INSTRUMENTS - RATES
CONTINUE DOWN

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

DURING ITS WEEKLY AUCTIONS IN SEPTEMBER, THE CENTRAL
BANK PLACED BS. 188.8 BILLION (USD 249.7 MILLION) IN
180, 269, AND 358-DAY MONETARY STABILIZATION INSTRUMENTS
(TEMS), AT CLOSING NOMINAL INTEREST RATES OF 30.7, 31.8,
AND 33.0, RESPECTIVELY.  THE EFFECTIVE RATES ARE 29.3,
33.6, AND 35.5, RESPECTIVELY.  EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES
ON TEMS DECREASED FOLLOWING THE END OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS
IN APRIL 1996 UNTIL MID-AUGUST 1996 WHEN INTEREST RATES
BEGAN TO RISE.  EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES ON TEMS
DECREASED ONCE AGAIN FROM MID-SEPTEMBER UNTIL
MID-OCTOBER.  ACCORDING TO VENECONOMY (A PRIVATE
CONSULTING FIRM), THE CENTRAL BANK IS SEEKING A TEM
INTEREST RATE LEVEL WHICH IS LOW ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE
HOT MONEY FROM COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND HIGH ENOUGH
TO DISCOURAGE DOMESTIC INVESTORS FROM MOVING FUNDS OUT.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: MONEY SUPPLY/M2 - EXPANDS SLOWLY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS INCREASED 21.5 PERCENT SINCE
DECEMBER 1995.  THESE INCREASES ARE THE RESULT OF
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY
STERILIZED AND THE INFLUX OF DOLLLARS INTO THE CARACAS
STOCK EXCHANGE.  IN ADDITION, MOST CONSUMERS STILL
PREFER TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN CHECKING ACCOUNTS AND
SAVINGS DEPOSITS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES FOR
WHICH PRICES INCREASE RAPIDLY.  INCREASES IN THE MONEY
SUPPLY PUT ADDITIONAL DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON INTEREST
RATES THAT ARE ALREADY NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS.  PLANS TO
CHANNEL ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUES TO EXTERNAL DEBT
PAYMENTS WILL HELP THE GOV MODERATE INCREASES IN THE
MONEY SUPPLY AND THE RATE OF INFLATION.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: CURRENT INTEREST RATES - NEGATIVE RATES CONTINUE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

INTEREST RATES IN GENERAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY DURING
THE MONTH, ALTHOUGH THE MARGIN BETWEEN THE AVERAGE
LENDING RATE (34.68 PERCENT) AND THE AVERAGE CD RATE
(20.95 PERCENT) FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS DECREASED.
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECREASING IN GENERAL TERMS
SINCE THE END OF APRIL.  EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE
FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN PUSHING INTEREST RATES DOWN,
WHICH ARE ALREADY NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - STUBBORN, BUT ON THE
DECLINE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR THE CARACAS METROPOLITAN
AREA INCREASED 3.6 PERCENT IN SEPTEMBER, WHICH IS LOWER
THAN THE INCREASE REGISTERED THE MONTH BEFORE (4.1
PERCENT).   THIS IS THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY DECLINE
AND SUPPORTS THE GOV'S CLAIM THAT INFLATION IS ON A
DOWNWARD TREND TOWARDS A TARGET MONTHLY INFLATION RATE OF
1.5 TO 2 PERCENT.  THE INCREASE FROM SEPTEMBER 1995 TO
SEPTEMBER 1996 WAS 115.2 PERCENT, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST
ANNUAL INFLATION INCREASE EVER RECORDED FOR VENEZUELA.
THIS RECORD 12-MONTH ANNUAL INFLATION FIGURE IS EXPECTED
TO DECLINE DURING COMING MONTHS AS MONTHLY INFLATION
CONTINUES TO DECLINE.  INFLATIONARY EXPECTATIONS DECLINED
IN PART DUE TO POSITIVE MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS RELEASED
DURING SEPTEMBER.  AMONG THESE FAVORABLE INDICATORS ARE
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RECORD INTERNATIONAL RESERVES, A
RISING CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX, A SUCCESSFUL GOV BOND
ISSUE IN THE GERMAN FINANCIAL MARKET, AND THE APPRECIATION
OF THE BOLIVAR AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: INT'L RESERVES - SURPASS 1996 GOALS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES ROSE FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE
MONTH IN SEPTEMBER.  THIS MONTH THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY
DUE TO HIGHER OIL EARNINGS, STEMMING FROM IMPROVED PRICES
AND EXPORT VOLUME.  THE PLACEMENT OF THE GOV'S DEUTSH MARK
BOND ISSUE FOR AROUND USD 420 MILLION ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO
THIS INCREASE.  THE UNEXPECTED INCREASE IN RESERVES LED
THE GOV TO FOREGO THE SECOND USD 500 MILLION TRANCHE FROM
ITS IMF STAND-BY PROGRAM AND TO CONSIDER CANCELLING PLANS
FOR USD 450 MILLION IN IDB AND WORLD BANK LOANS TO FINANCE
FAST-DISBURSING SOCIAL SAFETY-NET PROGRAMS (USD 300
MILLION WITH THE IDB AND USD 150 MILLION WITH THE WORLD
BANK) DURING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 7.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: SUMMARY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR SEPTEMBER PAINT A
POSITIVE PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY.  AMONG THESE FAVORABLE
INDICATORS ARE WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RECORD INTERNATIONAL
RESERVES, A RISING CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX, A
SUCCESSFUL GOV BOND ISSUE IN THE GERMAN FINANCIAL MARKET,
AND A CONTINUING DECLINE IN THE INFLATION RATE.
VENEZUELA'S AVERAGE OIL EXPORT BASKET HAS INCREASED
STEADILY SINCE JANUARY, CLOSING AT USD 22.60 PER BARREL ON
OCTOBER 15, THE HIGHEST PRICE SINCE 1990.  AS A RESULT,
INTERNATIONAL RESERVES REACHED A NEW RECORD BY THE END OF
SEPTEMBER (USD 12,711 MILLION).  THE GOV HAS REITERATED
ITS PLANS TO USE EXCESS OIL PROFITS TO PAY DEBT, A
STRATEGY AIMED AT MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL OIL INCOME AND
AVOIDING THE MONETIZATION OF THE WINDFALL WHICH WOULD FUEL
INFLATION AND PLACE PRESSURE ON THE CURRENCY (THE
BOLIVAR).  RECORD HIGHS ON THE CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE
CAPITALIZATION INDEX WERE DUE TO LOW DOMESTIC INTEREST
RATES AND POSITIVE EXPECTATIONS OF THE GOV'S PRIVATIZATION
PROGRAM.  FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN LOCAL EQUITIES LED TO A
SLIGHT APPRECIATION OF THE BOLIVAR AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

VIETNAM ESTABLISHES 2ND NAT'L TELECOM COMPANY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   IN JULY 1996, THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE SECOND
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY BY FORMING THE SAIGON POSTAL
CORPORATION (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE SAIGON POST AND
TELECOMMUNICATIONS JOINT-STOCK CORPORATION). THE SAIGON POSTAL
CORPORATION (SPC) WILL COMPETE WITH THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT
MONOPOLY, VIETNAM POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (VNPT).
THE COMPANY WAS ORGANIZED AS A JOINT-STOCK COMPANY WITH ELEVEN
SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING VNPT AND THE BEN THANH TOURIST SERVICE
COMPANY, EACH OWNING APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT. OTHER SHAREHOLDERS
INCLUDE THE MINISTRIES OF INTERIOR AND DEFENSE. THE COMPANY FALLS
UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY PEOPLES COMMITTEE.
SPC IS ESTABLISHED AS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ENTITY FROM THE
EXISTING HO CHI MINH CITY POSTS & TELECOM COMPANY.

2.   SPC, WHILE INITIALLY FOCUSING ON PROVIDING POST AND TELECOM
SERVICES TO THE SOUTHERN REGION, WILL BE INVOLVED EVENTUALLY IN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN
ORDER TO PROVIDE WIDER TELEPHONE ACCESS TO SOUTHERN PROVINCES,
SPC WILL EXPAND WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICES AND MOBILE PHONE
NETWORKS IN THE ECONOMICALLY KEY MEKONG DELTA PROVINCES, SUCH AS
TAY NINH, DONG NAI AND VUNG TAU.

3.   THE NEW CORPORATION WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UPGRADING
THE TELECOM NETWORKS WHICH CONNECT THE SOUTHERN SONG BE AND TAY
NINH PROVINCES TO QUANG NAM - DANANG PROVINCE, IN THE CENTRAL
REGION AND QUANG NINH PROVINCE IN THE NORTH.  SPC'S COMBINED
EXPANSION PLANS INCLUDE  INSTALLING 150,000 TO 200,00 FIXED
TELEPHONE LINES AND EXPANDING SATELLITE UPLINKS.

4.   ADDITIONAL SPC PLANS INCLUDE ESTABLISHING OF A FOREIGN
JOINT-VENTURE FACTORY TO PRODUCT TELEPHONY EQUIPMENT AND DEVELOP
A 100 - ACRE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIAL PARK. THIS PARK WILL BE LOCATED
IN THE THU DUC AREA, NEAR HO CHI MINH CITY AND WILL TARGET
TELECOM, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ELECTRONICS COMPANIES.

5.   A THIRD NATIONAL COMPETITOR MAY ENTER THE TELECOM SERVICES
SECTOR SOON. THE GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED THE FORMATION OF THE
MILITARY ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (VIETEL),
OWNED BY THE PEOPLES ARMY OF VIETNAM. GUIDELINES FOR VIETEL HAVE
YET TO BE ANNOUNCED, BUT EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE
IN FULL OPERATION BY LATE 1997. IT IS EXPECTED THAT VIETEL WILL
PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO THE EXISTING NATIONAL NETWORK,
POSSIBLY CONCENTRATING ON WIRELESS SYSTEMS ALONG THE DENSELY
POPULATED COAST.

6.    VIETEL FORMERLY KNOWN AS SIGELCO, IS ALREADY OPERATING AS A
MANUFACTURER, UNDER A LICENSE ISSUED IN NOVEMBER 1995. IT HAS
FORMED A FOREIGN  JOINT-VENTURE FACTORY TO PRODUCE TELEPHONE
EQUIPMENT AND ELECTRONICS FOR DOMESTIC SALE AND EXPORT. THE $20
MILLION PROJECT (VIETEL TECHNOLOGIES, LIMITED) WAS FUNDED BY
GOLDMAN SACHS (USA), NIKKO SECURITIES (JAPAN) AND A THAI
INVESTMENT GROUP. THE LOCAL PARTNERS CONSIST OF VIETEL AND THE
ARMY'S M1 COMMUNICATIONS FACTORY. THE JOINT-VENTURE  IS OWNED 70
PERCENT BY THE FOREIGN PARTNERS AND  30 PERCENT BY THE VIETNAMESE
ENTITIES.

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   ON MARCH 12, 1996, THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT

JOINT-VENTURE COMPANY TO TRANSPORT, DELIVER AND WAREHOUSE GOODS
IN VIETNAM TO TAIT (ASIA) LTD., A HONG KONG-BASED COMPANY AND ITS
LOCAL PARTNER, THIEN CANG COMPANY, LTD., A PRIVATE VIETNAMESE
FIRM. THE LICENSE PROVIDES FOR A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF $2.5
MILLION, SPLIT 50/50 BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, AND ALLOWS THE VENTURE

ONLY FOREIGN COMPANIES WITH MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM
WERE ALLOWED TO TRANSPORT, DELIVER AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT THEY
MANUFACTURED THEMSELVES. FOREIGN FIRMS ARE STILL PROHIBITED FROM
DISTRIBUTING THEIR PRODUCTS IN-COUNTRY.

2.   THE INABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR OWN PRODUCTS IN THE
VIETNAMESE MARKET HAS FRUSTRATED FOREIGN BUSINESSES. THE
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN VIETNAM CONSISTS OF A FRAGMENTED,
DISORGANIZED NETWORK OF STATE-OWNED AND PRIVATE IMPORT-EXPORT
COMPANIES, STATE-OWNED AND PRIVATE WHOLESALERS, INDEPENDENT
AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS LIMITED TO SMALL
FAMILY-RUN AND STATE-OWNED STORES.  UNTIL MARCH 12, FOREIGN FIRMS
WERE NOT PERMITTED TO MANAGE AND CONTROL DISTRIBUTION, THAT IS,
TRANSPORTATION, DELIVERY, WAREHOUSING, INVOICING AND MARKETING.

3.   UNDER VIETNAMESE LAW, THE IMPORTER ACTS AS THE CONSIGNEE AND
HOLDS TITLE TO THE IMPORTED GOODS.  THE TRADE MINISTRY MUST ISSUE
AN IMPORT LICENSE FOR EACH SHIPMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO QUOTA
RESTRICTIONS FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES. AS A MATTER OF POLICY,
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN PROJECTS SOLELY FOR TRADING AND
DISTRIBUTION IS NOT ENCOURAGED, AS THESE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES
ARE RESERVED FOR LOCAL COMPANIES.

4.   MANY FOREIGN DISTRIBUTORS HOPE THAT THE TAIT LICENSE IS A
STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF CREATING A LESS RESTRICTIVE TRADING
REGIME IN VIETNAM. THE LICENSE PERMITS THE JOINT-VENTURE TO LEASE
WAREHOUSE SPACE, PURCHASE AND OPERATE DELIVERY VEHICLES, DELIVER
MERCHANDISE AND PROVIDE MARKETING CONSULTANCY SERVICES.
UNFORTUNATELY,  THE LICENSE DOES NOT ALLOW THE JOINT-VENTURE TO
OWN THE GOODS BEING DELIVERED. ANY GOODS IMPORTED MUST BE
CONSIGNED TO A LEGALLY AUTHORIZED VIETNAMESE PARTY OUTSIDE OF THE
JOINT-VENTURE. IN ADDITION, THE JOINT-VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE THE
RIGHT TO COLLECT THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE.  MPI IS STILL
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ALLOW THE JOINT-VENTURE TO INVOICE
DIRECTLY AND COLLECT REVENUES. IF THIS OCCURS, THEN THE LICENSE
WILL MORE CLOSELY REPRESENT A TRUE COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
LICENSE.

5.   WHILE INDUSTRY EXPERTS ARE CAUTIOUS IN DRAWING ANY
CONCLUSION THAT THIS IS A IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT TO THE
INDUSTRY'S IMMINENT FURTHER DEREGULATION, IT IS NONETHELESS A
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND GIVES FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION
COMPANIES HOPE FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE VIETNAMESE MARKET.

GUATEMALA PASSES ELECTRICITY LAW

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in GUATEMALA CITY

1.  SUMMARY: THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS ON OCTOBER 16 PASSED
LANDMARK LEGISLATION TO RESTRUCTURE THE ELECTRICITY MARKET.
THIS KEY LAW OPENS AND DEMONOPOLIZES THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR TO
MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE TO THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT IS CRITICAL
TO MEETING PRESENT AND FUTURE ELECTRICITY GENERATION NEEDS IN
THE COUNTRY.  THE LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE AUTONOMOUS
RATE-SETTING ENTITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTED, DUE TO ITS
INABILITY TO SECURE A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY IN THE CONGRESS TO
CREATE THE INDEPENDENT ENTITY.  NONETHELESS, THE LOCAL IDB
REPRESENTATIVE BELIEVES THE LEGISLATION, AS PASSED, WILL
SATISFY THE RELEVANT CONDITION IN THE IDB INVESTMENT SECTOR
LOAN NOW BEING NEGOTIATED.  HOWEVER, FAILURE TO GAIN A LARGER
MAJORITY ON THIS BILL DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THE CREATION OF
OTHER NEW GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.  END SUMMARY

2.  FOLLOWING SEVERAL MONTHS OF DEBATE AND THE INCORPORATION OF
KEY AMENDMENTS, THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS ON OCTOBER 16 PASSED
ITS ELECTRICITY SECTOR MODERNIZATION AND DEMONOPOLIZATION LAW
BY A 49-23 MARGIN.  THE LAW IS BASED ON THE DRAFT LEGISLATION
DEVELOPED SEVERAL YEARS AGO THROUGH A USAID-FUNDED GRANT.  THE
PAN MAJORITY WAS JOINED BY SEVEN MEMBERS OF MINORITY PARTIES,
WHILE THE FRG AND FDNG PARTIES VOTED AS A BLOC IN OPPOSITION TO
THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL.

3.  THE NEW LAW WILL "DEMONOPOLIZE" THE POWER SECTOR AND
INCORPORATE MOST OF THE FEATURES OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ORIGINAL
PROPOSAL, I.E., UNBUNDLING OF PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION, AND
DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES; LIBERALIZED ENTRY TO THE POWER
INDUSTRY; AND UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BY
PRODUCERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALE CONSUMERS.  THE NOTABLE
SHORTCOMING OF THE LAW IS THAT THE RATE-SETTING COMMISSION WILL
BE SUBORDINATE TO THE MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND MINES, RATHER THAN
AUTONOMOUS, AS INITIALLY PROPOSED.  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
AUTONOMOUS ENTITY REQUIRED A 2/3 MAJORITY IN THE CONGRESS,
WHICH THE PAN MAJORITY WAS NOT ABLE TO MUSTER, AFTER A NUMBER
OF ATTEMPTS.

4.  AS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED BY A USAID CONTRACTOR AND APPROVED BY
THE ENERGY COMMITTEE OF THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS WITH THE STRONG
SUPPORT OF THE ENERGY MINISTER, THE RATE-SETTING COMMISSION WAS
TO BE AN AUTONOMOUS ENTITY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO SET TARIFFS
SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS TO BOTH RECOVER
COSTS AND PROVIDE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO EXPAND THE PRODUCTION
AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS.  UNDER THE APPROVED LEGISLATION THE
COMMISSION WILL FUNCTION AS INDICATED ABOVE, BUT UNDER THE
AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINES.  IT IS OUR
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GOVERNEMENT WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO
OPERATE WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF THE MINISTER AND WILL SEEK
TO CHANGE THE STATUS OF THE COMMISSION AT A LATER DATE.  THE
STATE-OWNED POWER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES ARE NOW
LOSING AS MUCH AS USD 140 MILLION PER YEAR AND ONLY ABOUT 30
PERCENT OF GUATEMALAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY
SERVICE.  THOUGH GUATEMALA'S STATE-OWNED ELECTRICITY PRODUCING
AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES ON OCTOBER 15 INDEPENDENTLY
INTRODUCED RATE INCREASES OF AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT, A
GUATEMALAN COURT, ONCE AGAIN, HAS ISSUED A PROVISIONAL
INJUNCTION SUSPENDING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW RATES.

5.  COMMENT: PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION, WITH OR WITHOUT THE
INDEPENDENT RATE SETTING ENTITY, IS A KEY STEP IN ATTRACTING
THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAPITAL THAT IS CRITICAL TO MEETING THE
PRESENT AND FUTURE ENERGY NEEDS OF GUATEMALA.  THE FAILURE OF
THE PAN TO MARSHAL THE 54 VOTES NEEDED TO SET UP AN INDEPENDENT
REGULATORY ENTITY HAD MUCH LESS TO DO WITH COMPETING VISIONS OF
THE FUTURE OF GUATEMALA'S ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY THAN WITH THE
EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER.  THE FRG, WHICH HAS 20 VOTES IN
THE CONGRESS, HAS LONG SUPPORTED REFORM OF THE ELECTRICITY
SECTOR AND HAD GIVEN WRITTEN ASSURANCES IT WOULD SUPPORT THE
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION.  NEVERTHELESS, THE VIGOROUS DEBATE OF
THIS ISSUE -- LITERALLY REACHING THE POINT OF PHYSICAL BLOWS --
IS A REMINDER TO THE PAN MAJORITY THAT THE POWER TO OBSTRUCT IS
POWER NONETHELESS, A POINT THAT WILL NO DOUBT BE RAISED WHEN
THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ENACT OTHER ELEMENTS OF ITS PLAN TO
MODERNIZE THE STATE.  END COMMENT.

TURKEY PUTS FORWARD A "BALANCED BUDGET" FOR 1997

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in ANKARA

1.  SUMMARY:  THE GOT LAST WEEK SUBMITTED ITS
FIRST-EVER BALANCED BUDGET TO PARLIAMENT.  PM
ERBAKAN CALLED THE 1997 BUDGET "REVOLUTIONARY,"
ALTHOUGH NEARLY ALL OTHER OBSERVERS TERMED IT
UNREALISTIC.  TO ERASE THE BUDGET DEFICIT -- WHICH
IS LIKELY TO REACH 10 PCT OF GNP THIS YEAR -- THE
GOT HAS PROJECTED A REAL REDUCTION IN INTEREST
EXPENSES IN 1997, A REAL INCREASE IN TAX REVENUES,
AND PINNED MOST OF ITS HOPES ON AN EXPLOSION IN
PRIVATIZATION RECEIPTS.  THE GOT ESTIMATES GROWTH
WILL SLOW TO 4 PCT IN 1997, AND IS PROJECTING A
MODEST DROP IN INFLATION TO 65 PCT. END SUMMARY.

-------------------------------------------------
REPUBLIC'S FIRST BALANCED BUDGET RAISES QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------

2.  ON OCTOBER 18 THE GOT SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT
ITS DRAFT BUDGET FOR 1997.  THE 1997 BUDGET, THE
FIRST PREPARED BY THE COALITION HEADED BY THE
ISLAMIST REFAH PARTY, IS THE FIRST BALANCED BUDGET
IN THE TURKISH REPUBLIC'S HISTORY.  PM ERBAKAN
CALLED THE BUDGET "REVOLUTIONARY," WHILE HIS
JUNIOR COALITION PARTNER, TANSU CILLER, CLAIMED
THAT THE BUDGET WAS BASED ON FACTS, NOT FICTION.
NEARLY ALL OBSERVERS OUTSIDE THE COALITION
GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAVE DISMISSED THE 1997 DRAFT
AS UNREALISTIC.  THE BUDGET DEFICIT THIS YEAR --
BLOATED BY ELECTION SPENDING AND ERBAKAN'S
POPULIST ECONOMIC MEASURES -- IS LIKELY TO REACH
10 PCT OF GNP.  EVEN UNDER CILLER'S 1994 AUSTERITY
PROGRAM, THE GOT WAS UNABLE TO BRING THE DEFICIT
BELOW 3.5 PCT OF GNP.

3.  THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENT OF THE 1997
BUDGET IS A PLANNED SURGE IN NON-TAX REVENUE,
PRIMARILY RECEIPTS FROM PRIVATIZATION.  NON-TAX
REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO SOAR BY 765 PCT IN
NOMINAL TERMS, VERSUS A PLANNED 65 PCT INFLATION
RATE.  NEARLY ALL OF THIS REFLECTS THE GOT'S
ESTIMATE OF 8.7 BILLION USD FROM SALE OF STATE
ASSETS NEXT YEAR.  THIS INCLUDES PRIVATIZATION OF
STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES AS WELL AS SALE OF STATE
LAND, HOUSING AND SOCIAL FACILITIES.  THIS
ESTIMATE IS NEARLY THREE TIMES THE TOTAL AMOUNT
THE GOT HAS RAISED FROM PRIVATIZATION OVER THE
LAST 10 YEARS; IN THE FIRST 9 MONTHS OF 1996 THESE
RECEIPTS TOTALLED ONLY 300 MILLION USD.

4.  ON THE EXPENSE SIDE, INTEREST WILL CONTINUE TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE LION'S SHARE, REPRESENTING 30
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BUDGET IN 1997.  HOWEVER,
THE NOMINAL INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSES IS ONLY
24 PCT OVER 1996, VERSUS 65 PCT EXPECTED
INFLATION.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOT IS PROJECTING
A SIGNIFICANT REAL DROP IN INTEREST PAYMENTS NEXT
YEAR.

5.  THE BUDGET ALSO RELIES ON A NOMINAL INCREASE
IN TAX REVENUES OF 99 PCT NEXT YEAR.  PM ERBAKAN
HAS ANNOUNCED THAT REFORMS IN TAX ADMINISTRATION,
TO BE UNVEILED LATER THIS YEAR, WILL HAVE AN
IMMEDIATE IMPACT BY BROADENING THE TAX BASE AND
INCREASING COMPLIANCE; NO NEW TAXES ARE EXPECTED.
OBSERVERS REMAIN HIGHLY SCEPTICAL, HOWEVER, BOTH
OF THE GOT'S ABILITY TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE
LONG-POSTPONED TAX REFORM PROGRAM, AND THE SPEED
WITH WHICH RESULTS WILL BE VISIBLE.  PREVIOUSLY
THE GOT HAS ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CHANGES IN
THE TAX ADMINISTRATIONS SYSTEM WILL TAKE 3-5 YEARS
TO HAVE AN IMPACT.

-----------
THE NUMBERS
-----------

6.  THE BUDGET DRAFT SETS REVENUES AND
EXPENDITURES FOR NEXT YEAR AT 47 BILLION USD
(BASED ON THE PROJECTED AVERAGE DOLLAR EXCHANGE
RATE FOR 1997 OF 135,000).  INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE
EXPECTED TO TAKE 30 PCT OF TOTAL EXPENDITURES,
WITH PERSONNEL PAYMENTS ABSORBING 27 PCT.  PM
ERBAKAN HAS PLEDGED TO INCREASE CIVIL SERVANT
SALARIES IN LINE WITH INFLATION; THE FINANCE
MINISTER HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED A 30 PCT INCREASE
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 1997.  HOWEVER, SOME EARLY
CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE 1997 BUDGET'S
ALLOCATION FOR PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO
INCREASE SALARIES BY AS MUCH AS THE PROJECTED
INFLATION INCREASE.

7.  THE DRAFT BUDGET FORESEES A LARGE INCREASE IN
PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENTS, JUMPING 131 PCT IN
NOMINAL TERMS.  TRANSFERS TO SOCIAL SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE ESTIMATED TO
RISE BY 54 PCT, OR BELOW THE PROJECTED RATE OF
INFLATION.

8.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE COMPARES THE 1997 BUDGET
WITH THIS YEAR'S:

---------------------
MACROECONOMIC TARGETS
---------------------

9.  THE GOT LAST WEEK ALSO ANNOUNCED THE FOLLOWING
MACROECONOMIC TARGETS USED IN CALCULATING THE 1997
BUDGET:  REAL GNP GROWTH WILL BE 4 PCT AND
INFLATION 65 PCT; THE AVERAGE USD EXCHANGE RATE
TARGET IS 135,000 TL; EXPORTS AND IMPORTS ARE
PROJECTED TO REACH TO 29.5 AND 50 BILLION USD
RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A TRADE DEFICIT OF 20.5
BILLION USD; THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT IS
ESTIMATED AS 5.6 BILLION USD.

----------------------
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET
----------------------

10.  REACTION TO THE 1997 BUDGET PROPOSALS HAS
BEEN UNIFORMLY NEGATIVE.  OPPOSITION PARTIES
SEVERELY CRITICIZED THE BUDGET; AN ANAP DEPUTY
CALLED IT "SHEER NONSENSE".  CHP'S VICE CHAIRMAN
SAID THAT CLAIMING THAT THE 1997 BUDGET WILL BE
BALANCED, THE GOVERNMENT WAS FOOLING NOT ONLY THE
PEOPLE BUT ALSO ITSELF.  RAHMI KOC, ONE OF
TURKEY'S MOST PROMINENT BUSINESSMEN, TOLD
REPORTERS THAT HE FOUND THE BUDGET TOTALLY
UNREALISTIC.  MOST ACADEMICIANS AND COLUMNISTS
ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE BUDGET'S
CREDIBILITY.  MANY PAPERS ALSO NOTED THAT THE
RELEASE OF THE BUDGET COINCIDED WITH THE VISIT OF
AN IMF DELEGATION TO ANKARA, AND CITED UNSOURCED
CLAIMS THAT THE IMF TEAM FOUND THE BUDGET "OVERLY
OPTIMISTIC."

11.  SEPTELS WILL PROVIDE FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE
1997 BUDGET, INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS WHICH TOOK
PLACE LAST WEEK DURING THE MEETING OF THE JOINT
ECONOMIC COMMISSION.

HUNGARY: PERSONAL FOREX SAVINGS FALL IN NINE MONTHS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

THE REAL VALUE OF PERSONAL SAVINGS HELD IN FOREIGN
CURRENCY ACCOUNTS FELL BY HUF 18 BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE
MONTHS OF THIS YEAR.  NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY FIGURES
SHOW THAT THE FORINT VALUE OF PERSONAL FOREX SAVINGS
INCREASED BY HUF 32 BILLION IN THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD.
HOWEVER, DEVALUATION ALONE WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE FORINT
VALUE OF THE AMOUNT HELD IN FOREX ACCOUNTS AT THE START OF
THE YEAR BY HUF 50 BILLION.  FOREX SAVINGS INCREASED BY
HUF 1.5 BILLION IN FORINT TERMS IN SEPTEMBER BUT THE 1.2
PERCENT RATE OF THE CRAWLING PEG DEVALUATION ALONE WOULD
HAVE CAUSED A HUF 5.5 BILLION INCREASE LAST MONTH.
PERSONAL SAVINGS HELD IN FOREX ACCOUNTS TOTALLED HUF 471
BILLION AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER.  MORE THAN 30 BANKS OFFER
PERSONAL FOREX ACCOUNTS BUT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL FOREX
SAVINGS ARE HELD AT OTP.  HALF OF ALL FOREX SAVINGS ARE IN
DEUTCH MARKS, 20 PERCENT IN U.S.DOLLARS AND 12 PERCENT IN
AUSTRIAN SHILLINGS.  FINANCIAL ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT FOREX
SAVINGS HAVE LOST THEIR APPEAL BECAUSE OF HIGHER YIELDS ON
FORINT SAVINGS AND THE PREDICTABLE RATE OF DEVALUATION BY
THE CRAWLING PEG MECHANISM.

HUNGARY: DEVALUATION EXHAUSTS ITS EXPORT-PROMOTING EFFECT

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

ACCORDING TO THE LATEST ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC
RESEARCH INSTITUTE (GKI), THE FORINT DEVALUATION LOST ITS
EXPORT-STIMULATING EFFECT AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR.
FOREIGN TRADE FIGURES SHOW ADVERSE TRENDS FROM THE SECOND
THIRD OF 1996, COMPARED TO EARLIER EXPECTATIONS.  EXPORTS
GREW BY 5.2 PERCENT, CALCULATED IN DOLLARS AND BY 8.9
PERCENT IN VOLUME DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, COMPARED TO
THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THESE FIGURES ARE DOWN FROM
THE FIRST QUARTER.

THE FORMERLY STRONG ACTIVITY IN EXPORTS MOTIVATED BY
EXTERNAL PRICES IN FORINT TERMS WEAKENED IN 1996.  THIS
WAS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT COMPANIES COULD
REALIZE A HIGHER INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES PRICES THAN IN
EXPORT PRICES DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF THE
CRAWLING-PEG DEVALUATION.  THE RISING IMPORT PRICES DUE TO
THE IMPORT DUTY SURCHARGE ALSO ASSISTED DOMESTIC
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES TO RAISE DOMESTIC PRICES ABOVE
EXPORT PRICES.  BY THE MIDDLE OF 1996, IN MOST INDUSTRIAL
SECTORS, THE PRICE ADVANTAGE OF EXPORTING CEASED TO EXIST.

GKI FORECASTS THAT THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS WILL GROW BY
6-7 PERCENT, WHILE IMPORTS WILL BE UP 3-4 PERCENT IN 1996.
THE MONTHLY ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE DUTY SURCHARGE,
WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE ABOLISHED BY JULY 1997, COULD
CAUSE A 10 PERCENT DECREASE IN THE COST OF IMPORTED GOODS,
THUS BOOSTING IMPORTS STRONGLY.  GKI EXPERTS DO NOT THINK
THAT THE IMPORT INCREASE COULD BE OFFSET BY A RISE IN THE
COMPETITIVENESS OF EXPORTS NEXT YEAR.

HUNGARY: GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES THREE-YEAR FORECAST

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

UNDER THE LAW ON PUBLIC FINANCES, THE GOVERNMENT IS
COMMITTED TO PRESENT A THREE-YEAR OUTLOOK OF MAJOR
ECONOMIC INDICATORS ACCOMPANYING THE ANNUAL BUDGET BILL.
ACCORDING TO THIS THREE-YEAR FORECAST, THE GOVERNMENT
EXPECTS A HUF 40 BILLION COMBINED DEFICIT IN THE TWO
SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS IN 1998 AND A HUF 28 BILLION DEFICIT
IN 1999 FOLLOWING A BALANCED BUDGET IN BOTH FUNDS IN 1997.
THE GFS GENERAL GOVERNMENT DEFICIT INCLUDING PRIVATIZATION
REVENUES IS FORECAST AT HUF 315.2 BILLION NEXT YEAR, 376.3
BILLION IN 1998 AND HUF 330.9 BILLION IN 1999.  THE GFS
DEFICIT IN PUBLIC FINANCES EXCLUDING INCOME FROM
PRIVATIZATION IS FORECAST AT 4.9 PERCENT OF GDP IN 1997,
4.3 PERCENT IN 1998, AND 3.3 PERCENT IN 1999.  THE
FORECAST PROJECTS 2 PERCENT GDP GROWTH NEXT YEAR, 3-4
PERCENT GROWTH IN 1998 AND 4-5 PERCENT GROWTH IN 1999.
THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS INFLATION OF 17-19 PERCENT NEXT
YEAR, 12-14 PERCENT IN 1998 AND 10 PERCENT IN 1999 WHILE
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCER PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE 1-3
PERCENT POINTS SLOWER THAN CONSUMER PRICES.  THE FORECAST
PROJECTS AN 8-10 PERCENT INCREASE IN EXPORTS NEXT YEAR
FOLLOWED BY A 5-7 PERCENT INCREASE IN 1998 AND A 7-9
PERCENT INCREASE IN 1999.

TERMS, ON AUGUST 1995.  THE VOLUME OF NEW CONSTRUCTION
ORDERS IN AUGUST WAS 18.5 PERCENT LOWER THAN IN THE SAME
MONTH OF LAST YEAR.  ORDERS ON CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES'
BOOKS WERE THE EQUIVALENT OF 4-5 MONTHS OUTPUT AT THE END
OF AUGUST.  WORK STARTED ON 185 CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WITH
A TOTAL BUDGET OF HUF 17 BILLION (CURRENT HUF/DOLLAR
EXCHANGE IS APPROXIMATELY 155 HUF/1 USD) IN AUGUST AND 141
PROJECTS WORTH HUF 7 BILLION WERE FINISHED.  THE VALUE OF
PROJECTS STARTED WAS 35 PERCENT HIGHER THAN IN AUGUST 1995
WHILE THE VALUE OF COMPLETED PROJECTS WAS 25 PERCENT
LOWER.

HUNGARY: PRIVATE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FORECASTS 2.5% GDP GROWTH IN 1997

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

(GKI) THE PRIVATE ECONOMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE
FORECASTS A 2.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN GDP, A 5-6 PERCENT
RISE IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND A 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN
INVESTMENTS FOR 1997.  GKI PROJECTS ANNUAL AVERAGE
CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION OF 20 PERCENT FOR NEXT YEAR, AN
AVERAGE OF TWO DIFFERENT ESTIMATIONS.  ASSUMING AN ANNUAL
25 PERCENT INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES, THE INFLATION RATE
COULD BE 19 PERCENT OR ASSUMING AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 40
PERCENT INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES, THE INFLATION RATE
COULD BE 21 PERCENT.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS, SUCH AS THE
ABOLITION OF THE 6 PERCENT IMPORT SURCHARGE IN THE FIRST
HALF OF 1997 AND TARIFF REDUCTIONS WILL REDUCE IMPORT
COSTS NEXT YEAR.  THE REDUCTION IN IMPORT COSTS COULD
RESULT IN AN IMPORT GROWTH RATE EXCEEDING THAT OF EXPORTS.
GKI FORECASTS AN EIGHT PERCENT IMPORT INCREASE AND A 6
PERCENT EXPORT INCREASE FOR 1997, RESULTING IN A USD 200-
300M RISE IN TRADE DEFICIT OVER THE YEAR.  GKI FORECASTS A
USD 2.5 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT OF USD 1.8-2 BILLION, WHICH
IS STILL SLIGHTLY BELOW THE VALUE OF EXPECTED DIRECT
FOREIGN CASH INVESTMENTS.

THE 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE
FUELLED BY IMPROVING THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR PRODUCERS
SUPPLYING THE DOMESTIC MARKET.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE
CENTRAL BUDGET ARE ALSO PLANNING TO INCREASE INVESTMENT
SPENDING.  ESTIMATIONS BASED ON TAX AMENDMENT PROPOSALS
FOR NEXT YEAR SHOW A 20 PERCENT INCREASE IN BOTH GROSS AND
NET WAGES, RESULTING IN NO FURTHER FALL IN REAL WAGES.
PERSONAL CONSUMPTION, HOWEVER, IS EXPECTED TO RISE BY 1
PERCENT, DUE TO DELAYED PURCHASES FROM PRECEDING YEARS.
HENCE THE GROWTH RATE OF PERSONAL SAVINGS IS EXPECTED TO
FALL SLIGHTLY.  DOMESTIC DEMAND IN VOLUME TERMS, IS
PROJECTED TO RISE TO 3 PERCENT AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENTS
AND CONSUMPTION.  GKI FORECASTS A CONSOLIDATED GENERAL
GOVERNMENT DEFICIT IN THE RANGE OF 4.5-5 PERCENT OF NEXT
YEAR'S GDP, SIMILAR TO THAT OF 1996.  (NOTE: REFTEL
EXPLAINS THE NEW ACCOUNTING MEASURE TO BE USED BY THE GOH
BEGINNING IN 1997.  WITHOUT THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
METHODS, THE 1997 CONSOLIDATED BUDGET WOULD BE THREE
PERCENT OF GDP.  END NOTE.)  PROVIDED FINANCING
REQUIREMENTS OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT EXCEED
THIS LIMIT, NOMINAL INTEREST COULD FALL FROM 22 PERCENT AT
THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR TO 19 PERCENT AT THE END.  GKI
WARNS THAT POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS EXPECTED FOR NEXT YEAR
ARE CONSIDERABLY THREATENED.  A POSSIBLE RISE IN DOMESTIC
DEMAND COULD GENERATE A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED IMPORT
INCREASE RATHER THAN BOOSTING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION.  IN
ADDITION, THE PLANNED RESTRUCTURING OF TAXES AND SOCIAL
SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS MAY NOT PRODUCE THE TARGETED
REVENUES.  FINALLY, GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1998 COULD LEAD
TO A SOFTENED ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1997.

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

ACCORDING TO THE FINANCE MINISTRY, HUNGARY'S GDP IS
EXPECTED TO GROW BY ONLY ONE PERCENT THIS YEAR AS A RESULT
OF DECLINING DOMESTIC DEMAND.  THE MINISTRY FORECASTS AN
