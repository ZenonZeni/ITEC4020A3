<BIG><STRONG>House Telecommunications Subcommittee Holds Hearing on Wireless Privacy Issues</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[Posted on February 6, 1997]</FONT> <IMG SRC="/images/news.gif" WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=12 BORDER=0 ALT="NEW!"> <P>

On Wednesday, February 5, 1997, the House Telecommunications Subcommittee held a
hearing to consider cellular privacy issues. CDT Executive Director Jerry
Berman, along with FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom, Deputy Assistant
Attorney General Robert Litt, Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association President Thomas Wheeler, and others testified before the panel.
<P>
Highlights of CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman's testimony:

<UL>
<LI>Preliminary findings of a Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) study of communications privacy, focusing on the effectiveness and coverage of ECPA, the implementation of CALEA, the potential of strong encryption technologies to protect privacy and security and prevent crime, and other issues. The study is being conducted at the request of Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and will be completed later this year; <P>

<LI>Issues relating to the implementation of CALEA, including concerns about the FBI's latest capacity notice; and<P>

<LI>Technical solutions to privacy, including the need for encryption policy reform.
</UL>

Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA), the Subcommittee Chairman, spoke strongly about the need for strong privacy protections in wireless data networks, and also announced that the House Telecommunicatinos Subcommittee will hold hearings on the Encryption issue in the comming months.

<BIG><STRONG>FBI Issues Scaled Back Surveillance Capacity Notice -- Cost and Capability Issues Remain</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[Posted on January 17, 1997 | Updated on February 14, 1997]</FONT> <P>

On Tuesday January 14, 1997, the FBI issued a revised notice of proposed
surveillance capacity as required by the 1994 Communications Assistance for
Law Enforcement Act (CALEA - a.k.a. Digital Telephony).  The notice details
projected increases in law enforcement wiretapping and other electronic
surveillance activity in the coming years.
<P>
While the latest notice appears far less expansive than the FBI's first
capacity notice issued in October of 1995, and while this notice, by
including the unprecedented release of baseline surveillance information on
a county-by-county basis, goes a long way towards satisfying some of CDT's
objections to the first notice, many serious issues remain.  
<P>
The new notice is subject to a 30 day comment period, in which telephone
companies, privacy advocates and members of the public can submit comments.
Any person can submit comments, directing them to the Telecommunications
Industry Liaison Unit, FBI, P.O. Box 220450, Chantilly, VA 20153-0450.  The
Bureau has not made arrangements for on-line submissions.  Hard-copy
comments must be submitted by mail, in triplicate.
