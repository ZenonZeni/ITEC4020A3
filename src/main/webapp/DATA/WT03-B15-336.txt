MK WINS SECOND RECENT MINE-MANAGEMENT CONTRACT IN INDONESIA<p>
</b></center>

BOISE --
Morrison Knudsen Corporation today announced the award of a 
mine-management services contract to provide operations management and 
technical assistance to P.T. Indominco Mandiri at a coal mine in East 
Kalimantan, Indonesia.
<P>     The contract was awarded to MK's Mining Group by Jakarta-based P.T. 
Indominco Mandiri and covers a three-year period with a two-year option at 
the Bontang Mine. It is the second mine operations contract recently 
awarded to MK. In late October, the company received a contract for
similar services at a mine of P.T. Bukit Sunur on the island of Sumatra.
<P>     "These two operations contracts have enhanced and solidified MK's 
presence in the rapidly expanding Indonesian mining market," said Steven 
Y. Chi,  Mining Group president. Chi added that, with annual mine 
production scheduled for nearly four million tonnes in 1998, the Bontang 
Mine will be a major coal supplier for Japanese utilities and other 
Pacific Rim coal consumers.
<P>     Under a separate contract awarded by P.T. Indominco Mandiri, MK and 
two joint-venture associates are providing engineering, procurement and 
construction-management services during development of the Bontang Mine, a 
project that includes a 35-kilometer haul road, coal crushing, handling 
and blending facilities and port facilities for up to 3.5 - 4.0 million 
tonnes of coal per year. 
<P>     MK currently retains project offices in Jakarta and Bontang, 
Kalimantan, and corporate offices in Singapore and Jakarta to serve 
Indonesia and the Pacific Rim.



<P>Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE--MK), founded in 1912, serves the 
world's environmental, industrial, mining, operations & maintenance, 
power, process, transportation and heavy construction markets as an 
engineer and constructor.<p>
