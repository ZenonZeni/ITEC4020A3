I.	INTRODUCTION

	The .i.Communications Decency Act of 1996, the &quot;CDA&quot;;, was 
passed by the United States Congress on February 1, 1996, and 
signed by the President into law on February 8, 1996.  It 
updates federal obscenity statutes, codified at .i.18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 
1462 ;(common carriage of obscenity) and 1465 (interstate and 
foreign commerce in obscenity).  It also amends the obscene and 
harassing telephone and dial-porn law, .i.47 U.S.C. &#167; 223;, to 
add a new offense of knowingly providing indecent material to 
minor children under age 18, codified at .i.&#167; 223 (d)-(h);, and 
is alleged to invalidly do so in these consolidated facial 
challenges.  See .i.Communications Decency Act of 1996, Title V, 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Act of Feb. 8, 1996, Pub. L. No. 
104-104 (S.652), 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. (110 Stat.) 133-43 ;(Appendix 
1 hereto).
	In Plaintiffs' challenge to the indecency sections of the 
CDA, Plaintiffs seek an unprecedented legal and social paradigm 
shift of enormous proportion.  In their zeal for unfettered 
freedom to distribute all material, however pornographic, 
without any consideration for the large audience of children 
online, Plaintiffs urge this Court, in effect, to surrender the 
legislature's compelling interests in protecting children in 
favor of the economic interests and ideological wishes of 
computer indecency providers so that they may be unburdened and 
untroubled by even reasonable responsibilities for their 
offensive discourse.  Plaintiffs posit the issue as an either-or 
proposition:  either we have no law and technology flourishes, 
or we have law and technological progress grinds to a halt.  
This is a preposterous proposition.  Internet technology will no 
doubt continue to flourish undaunted by the presence of the 
CDA.1  To suggest, as Plaintiffs do, that the CDA would 
seriously hinder the healthy development of this important new 
technology is to maintain that its development depends upon the 
ability of adults to use this technology to give or show 
patently offensive sexual or excretory depictions to children 
and to each other in a way that is also available to children, 
as if it were an indispensable feature of the medium.2
	Plaintiffs interpret the CDA so broadly that it would reach 
protected speech and thus be unconstitutional.  
	Amici interpret the CDA so narrowly that it doesn't reach 
protected speech and thereby be fully constitutional.  
	As we do, Congress, the CDA's sponsors, and the President 
viewed the CDA as narrowly applying to unprotected indecent 
material and not as a threat to serious sexual discussions and 
materials.  See .i.&quot;Conference Report on the CDA&quot;, Joint 
Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference, Report for 
P.L. 104-104, Title V-Obscenity and Violence, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 
Leg. Hist. 200-11; (Appendix 2); .i.141 CONG. REC. S9770-75 
(daily ed. July 12, 1995); and .i.141 CONG. REC. S8328, 8337, 
8386, et seq. (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. 
Exon); (Appendix 3); .i.White House letter of Feb. 28, 1996, to 
Senator James Exon from Jack Quinn, Counsel to the President; 
(Appendix 4).  
	These Amici Curiae submit that this Court should, and is 
bound by its constitutional obligations in reviewing federal 
statutes to, interpret the CDA to protect legitimate sexual 
treatment that should not be considered indecent and fashion 
guidance on complying with this important new law.
	The CDA was enacted by overwhelming votes of members of 
both political parties in both chambers of the Congress in order 
to protect minor children who use the new interactive computer 
services and the Internet from being given harmful pornography 
by adults.  It requires that adults who wish to use &quot;adult&quot; 
sexual expression that is &quot;patently offensive&quot; in its treatment 
of sexual or excretory activities or organs to put electric 
blinder racks in front of such pornography so their and our 
children don't see it.  This can be done to a great extent under 
present custom, usage, and technology, can be assisted in great 
degree by voluntary measures taken by industry and by parents 
with developing screening devices, and will be possible to a 
greater extent as the future unfolds with advancing technology, 
computer communication protocols, standards of practice, and 
hardware/software developments.  
	Adults do not have a First Amendment right to speak 
indecently on publicly available sites of the Internet, World 
Wide Web, or Usenet where children are present, any more than 
they do in public streets, roadside billboards, privately owned 
retail bookracks open to the general public, public airwave 
radio and TV shows, CB radio bands, basic cable TV channels, the 
dial-it phone services, or other public forums and mass 
communications mediums.  The issue before the Court should not 
be whether consenting adults who wish to traffic in indecent 
pornography on the Internet or within a commercial online 
service provider's system would find it  bothersome or difficult 
to restrict it from minors, but whether the provider of such 
indecency should bear the burden of taking good faith efforts to 
restrict his indecent material from minor children.  This case 
should also clarify that the test for &quot;indecency&quot; is not vague 
and will not be allowed to be overbroad in its interpretation or 
application.  Serious works of literature, art, science, and 
politics are not realistically within the scope of the CDA, are 
not &quot;patently offensive&quot; or &quot;indecent&quot; to the average person in 
American society, and are neither obscene nor legally indecent.  
Such truly legitimate communications were not intended by 
Congress to be within CDA's scope and can be declared by this 
Court to be outside its reach and fully protected on the 
Internet, as in all other public forums, even for children.  
	The CDA only requires adults to refrain from sending 
flagrantly offensive pornographic representations of sex and 
nudity to children or posting them in &quot;cyber&quot; places where they 
know children will get such harmful materials.  Placing &quot;adult&quot; 
material that is too indecent for children in &quot;adults only&quot; 
areas of the Internet is possible under available methods and 
practices and, where it is not possible to restrict it from 
children and the provider knows it will be obtained and 
available to children, then the provider has an obligation to 
society and common decency to refrain from putting such harmful 
pornography into the faces and minds of our children until such 
time as the material can be screened from them.  The CDA uses 
the least restrictive yet effective means to frame the 
parameters of the legal requirements placed on adults to protect 
children from indecency.






.c.II.	THIS COURT IS OBLIGED TO INTERPRET THE CDA 
NARROWLY, 
	SO AS TO SAVE IT, AND, IF NECESSARY, LEND IT AN 
AUTHORITATIVE CONSTRUCTION, SO AS TO MAKE IT 
CONSTITUTIONALLY ENFORCEABLE.
	The Complaints filed by the ACLU Plaintiffs and ALA 
Plaintiffs allege that the CDA's indecency provisions, to be 
codified at .i.47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 223(a)(1)(B), 223(a)(2), and 
223(d);, are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in several 
respects and ask this Court to declare them unconstitutional on 
their face and enjoin their enforcement in toto.  
	These amici respectfully submit that this Court may not do 
what Plaintiffs ask.  The Court's obligation is to interpret 
these sections narrowly and construe the CDA so as to be 
constitutionally valid and enforceable now and in the future.
	This may not be an expedient undertaking, and may require 
present and future consideration of developments in technology 
(as the FCC will also do in promulgating good faith defenses in 
the future pursuant to .i.&#167; 223(e)(6);), but this Court's 
supervisory jurisdiction and its duty to construe federal 
legislation that is subject to narrowing limits, as is the CDA, 
require such an analysis and interpretation in this case.  The 
Supreme Court feels this burden as well, as stated in .i.Miller 
v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 29-30 (1973);, but faces up to the 
&quot;tough individual problem of constitutional judgment&quot; involved 
in these cases.
	The CDA is not a total ban on indecency, and should not be 
interpreted to have the same effect as a ban.  Because it is not 
a total ban of indecent speech, it is capable of narrowing 
constitutional construction by this Court.  The CDA is unlike 
the indecent dial-a-porn statute that was before the Supreme 
Court in .i.Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 
115 (1989);.  There, the total ban version of prior .i.&#167; 223(b); 
was incapable of any narrowing construction, since Congress 
plainly criminalized the distribution of indecent material to 
consenting adults.  In contrast, the CDA criminalizes the 
knowing transmission of indecent material to a specific minor 
child and the knowing display of indecent material to minors.  
The new crimes in this Act require that an offender act 
&quot;knowingly&quot; by knowing of the indecent character of the 
communication and knowing that it is going to or is available to 
minors.  .i.Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 644 (1968);; 
.i.Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 119-24 (1974);; 
.i.Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 113 n.9, 115 (1990);; .i.U.S. 
v. X-Citement Video, Inc., __ U.S. __ , 115 S. Ct. 464, 130 
L.Ed.2d 372 (1994);. 
	Under the CDA, it is not a crime and is lawful activity for 
adults to speak indecently to other adults, consenting or not.  
Furthermore, even if a child or juvenile does obtain indecent 
material, it is a defense, under .i.&#167; 223(e)(5) and (f)(1);, to 
criminal or civil liability, that the provider of the indecent 
content took good faith actions under available technology to 
limit such speech to adults.  This is the point upon which this 
case must turn, legally and technologically. 	This Court should 
render an interpretation of the CDA that allows for compliance 
under present technology as well as in the future according to 
what is feasible at that time.  The CDA nicely lends itself to 
this type of interpretation by defining good faith defenses as 
&quot;any method which is feasible under available technology&quot;. .i.&#167; 
223(e)(5)(A);; &quot;Conference Report on the CDA,&quot; .i.1996 
U.S.C.C.A.N. Leg. Hist. at 204;.

.c.III.	THE CDA IS CONSTITUTIONAL.

.c.A.	THE TEST FOR VAGUENESS IS NOT MERE 
UNCERTAINTY BUT SUFFICIENTLY DEFINITE WARNING 
OF CRIMINALITY.
	&quot;Condemned to the use of words, we can never expect 
mathematical certainty from our language.&quot;  So stated the Court 
in .i.Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 110 (1972);.  
The Court in .i.Grayned, at 107-09;, upheld a city noise 
ordinance in light of three concerns in reviewing for 
unconstitutional vagueness: first, fair warning; second, 
prevention of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement; and 
third inhibition of First Amendment freedoms.  These principles 
are true when faced with First Amendment speech and expression 
issues, as in other areas of the law.  The 	First Amendment 
sexual expression test for facial validity in response to a 
vagueness challenge was developed by the Supreme Court beginning 
with .i.Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 491-92 (1957);, 
where Justice Brennan noted that the statutory phrase of 
&quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy..or...of an indecent 
character&quot; was not perfectly precise but was subject to 
reasonable interpretation, construction, and application (by 
combining them into the term &quot;obscenity&quot; and providing a Court 
announced test for applying that term in future cases):

The thrust of the argument is that these words are 
not sufficiently precise because they do not mean the 
same thing to all people, all the time, everywhere.  
Many decisions have recognized that these terms of 
obscenity statutes are not precise.  This Court, 
however, has consistently held that lack of precision 
is not itself offensive to the requirements of due 
process.
*	*	*
&quot;...[T]he Constitution does not require impossible 
standards&quot;; all that is required is that the language 
&quot;conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the 
proscribed conduct when measured by common 
understanding and practices....&quot;
	The Court in .i.Roth; construed the obscenity law and gave 
us the &quot;Roth Test&quot; -- basically, that obscenity be predominantly 
prurient in its intended appeal.  Later the Court would give us 
the &quot;Roth-Memoirs Test&quot; by adding that obscenity must depict sex 
in a patently offensive way and be utterly without redeeming 
social value&quot;.  .i.Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 418 
(1966);.  The Court then settled on a formula for the &quot;Miller 
Test&quot; that requires that unprotected material lack &quot;serious 
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot;. .i.Miller 
v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24-25 (1973);.  A year later, in 
.i.Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 114-15 (1974);, the 
Court was faced with a federal statute and avoided a vagueness 
problem by construing it to adopt the &quot;Miller Test&quot; as a 
constitutional standard to give &quot;notice&quot; of criminality, not 
absolute universal certainty, stating:

As noted above, we indicated in .i.United States v. 
12 200-ft. Reels of Film;...that we were prepared to 
construe the generic terms in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462 to be 
limited to the sort of &quot;patently offensive 
representations or descriptions of the specific 'hard 
core' sexual conduct given as examples in Miller v. 
California.&quot;  We now so construe the companion 
provision in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1461....  As so construed, 
we do not believe that petitioners' attack on the 
statute as unconstitutionally vague can be sustained.
*	*	*
And while the Court in Miller did refer to &quot;specific 
prerequisites&quot; which &quot;will provide fair notice to a 
dealer in such materials,&quot; ...the Court immediately 
thereafter quoted the language of the Court in 
Roth...concluding with these words:
	&quot;That there may be marginal cases in which it is 
difficult to determine the side of the line on which 
a particular fact situation falls is no sufficient 
reason to hold the language too ambiguous to define a 
criminal offense....'&quot; 
[citations omitted]


.c.B.	UNCONSTITUTIONAL OVERBREADTH MUST BE BOTH 
REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL AND IS CURED BY 
CONSTRUCTION.
	The &quot;substantial overbreadth&quot; doctrine of .i.Broadrick v. 
Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973);, is that, to be 
unconstitutionally overbroad, &quot;the overbreadth of a statute must 
not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to 
the statute's plainly legitimate sweep&quot;.  
	The Court in .i.Hamling;, at 113, prefaced it holding that 
&#167; 1461 was valid, as construed that day and understood in light 
of previous precedent, by quoting from .i.12 200-ft. Reels, 
supra, 413 U.S. 123, at 130 n. 7 (1973);:

&quot;We further note that, while we must leave to state 
courts the construction of state legislation, we do 
have a duty to authoritatively construe federal 
statutes where a 'serious doubt of constitutionality 
is raised' and '&quot;a construction of the statute is 
fairly possible by which the question may be 
avoided.&quot;' 
	The Court has &quot;traditionally viewed vagueness and 
overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines&quot;, 
.i.Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n. 8 (1983);, but the 
duty of federal courts differs with regard to their review of 
federal, as opposed to state, laws.  If this were a state law 
challenge under .i.42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983;, this Court would have no 
jurisdiction to authoritatively construe its language.  As 
stated in .i.Grayned, supra, 408 U.S. at 110;, federal courts 
cannot &quot;extrapolate its allowable meaning...for it is not within 
our power to construe and narrow state laws&quot;.  The task is 
appositive for federal laws, however, as the Court also noted in 
.i.Grayned;, Id., where it referred to its decision in .i.United 
States v. 37 Photographs, 402 U.S. 363, 369-70 (1971); (a quote 
relied on in .i.Hamling; and .i.12 200-ft. Reels;, supra, 
above), where it was held that &quot;we lack jurisdiction 
authoritatively to construe state legislation...[but in] dealing 
with a federal statute...[federal courts have the] power to give 
it an authoritative construction...consistent with its 
legislative purpose&quot;.  This duty was highlighted in the Court's 
child pornography case, .i.New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769 
n. 24 (1982);, where the Court reminded:

When a federal court is dealing with a federal 
statute challenged as overbroad, it should, of 
course, construe the statute to avoid constitutional 
problems, if the statute is subject to such a limited 
construction.

.c.C.	AUTHORITATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION 
IS PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR FIRST AMENDMENT 
;RELATED LAWS SUCH AS THE COMMUNICATIONS 
DECENCY ACT.
	Plaintiffs in this case make much of the narrowness of 
their challenge to the CDA as questioning only the indecency 
provisions and not its obscenity law amendments to argue that 
this case is not about &quot;obscenity&quot; or &quot;child pornography&quot;, but 
the &quot;indecency&quot; standard they challenge was developed with and 
because of the same First Amendment principles applicable to 
separating protected expression from unprotected obscenity and 
child pornography and materials harmful to minors.  As discussed 
below, the test for determining whether the manner of treating 
sex and nudity is &quot;indecent&quot; had its roots and derives from the 
second prong of the &quot;Miller Test&quot; for patent offensiveness.  The 
vagueness and overbreadth arguments made here as to &quot;indecency&quot; 
and &quot;patently offensive&quot; under &quot;contemporary community 
standards&quot; have been met and rejected and/or corrected in 
previous obscenity, and child exploitation, harmful to minors, 
and indecency cases in the Supreme Court.
	In .i.New York v. Ferber;, supra, 458 U.S. at 766-74, the 
Court discussed the rules governing facial challenges and those 
to statutes as applied.  The New York Court of Appeals thought 
its child pornography statute &quot;could&quot; reach protected speech in 
some hypothetical applications and, instead of narrowing it by 
construction, struck the statute.  The Supreme Court found, 458 
U.S. at 769, that the court below misapplied the &quot;substantial 
overbreadth&quot; doctrine of Broadrick and reiterated that facial 
invalidity is a drastic and narrow exception that must be 
&quot;carefully tied to the circumstances in which facial 
invalidation of a statute is truly warranted&quot; and is &quot;strong 
medicine&quot; employed &quot;only as a last resort&quot;.  The Court, at 773-
74, explained:

While the reach of the statute is directed at the 
hard core of child pornography, the Court of Appeals 
was understandably concerned that some protected 
expression, ranging from medical textbooks to 
pictorials in the National Geographic, would fall 
prey to the statute.  How often, if ever, it may be 
necessary to employ children to engage in conduct 
clearly within the reach of &#167; 263.15 in order to 
produce educational, medical, or artistic works 
cannot be known with certainty.  Yet we seriously 
doubt, and it has not been suggested, that these 
arguably impermissible applications of the statute 
amount to more than a tiny fraction of the materials 
within the statute's reach.  Nor will we assume that 
the New York courts will widen the possibly invalid 
reach of the statute by giving an expansive 
construction to the proscription on &quot;lewd 
exhibition[s] of the genitals.&quot;  Under these 
circumstances, &#167; 263.15 is &quot;not substantially 
overbroad and...whatever overbreadth may exist should 
be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact 
situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may 
not be applied.&quot; [citing Broadrick]
	An analogous statement is evident for this case as to the 
use of indecent material to make a serious point on the 
Internet.  How often, if ever, it may be necessary to use 
patently offensive sexual or excretory language or pictures in 
order to produce educational, medical, or artistic works cannot 
be known with certainty, but these arguably impermissible and 
certainly rare applications of the indecency standard can and 
should be considered to be beyond the legitimate reach of the 
law.  
	For an illustration of the lack of impact that indecency 
laws and regulations have had in broadcasting, or would have on 
public BBS and other interactive computer systems, the courts 
need only inspect the dismissal letters and decisions of the 
Federal Communications Commission's Enforcement Division of the 
Mass Media Bureau, several of which are in Appendix 8 hereto.1  
Speculation is easy, but the courts and the public can look at 
the public FCC record to see that legitimate speech is not 
brought within the ambit of indecency regulation over the public 
airwaves.  Even if speakers and content providers have to hold 
off using indecent language or images on public areas of the 
computer networks where children are invited as part of the 
general public, the messages the speakers convey can remain 
unchanged.  The subject matter is not what can be found 
indecent, only the patently offensive sexual references used to 
convey the message need be tailored for the audience, when it 
contains minor children, or restricted only to reach adults, for 
whom it is protected.  
	One of the most important legal quotations for use in 
understanding and deciding the instant controversy is that from 
the Court in .i.FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 743 n. 
18 (1978);, where the First Amendment principle of free 
expression of ideas was guaranteed its due protection by the law 
and the Government and the courts (emphasis added):

A requirement that indecent language be 
avoided will have its primary effect on the 
form, rather than the content, of serious 
communication.    There are few, if any, 
thoughts that cannot be expressed by the use 
of less offensive language.
	Furthermore, there is absolutely nothing in the record 
before this Court to prove or suggest or even imply that the 
indecency standard will apply to or should restrain serious 
treatment of sexual subjects such as alleged by some plaintiffs 
and their witnesses as to non-pornographic medical, public 
health, education, and political materials.  The burden is on 
the Plaintiffs to show the likelihood of success on their 
complaint that the CDA would in fact cause a real and 
substantial prior restraint upon protected expression.  They did 
not and cannot.  This Court can and should reject their claim of 
facial invalidity and then interpret the CDA so that it could 
not have such allegedly unconstitutional applications.  The 
issue need not be left unresolved. 

.c.D.	THE CDA IS SUBJECT TO PROPER NARROWING AND 
CAN BE INTERPRETED AS FULLY CONSTITUTIONAL, AS 
HAS BEEN DONE WITH EXISTING OBSCENITY AND 
SEXUAL EXPRESSION RELATED LAWS.
	If the Court decides that the indecency standard for the 
Internet would and should not apply to serious art and 
literature in our museums and libraries, nor to serious 
discussions and illustrations of sexual disease, medicine, or 
education programs, nor to protected political speech, nor to 
public discussions of law and legal cases on pornography, etc., 
then this Court is obliged to so state on the record and thus 
narrow the scope of the CDA to reach only the type of patently 
offensive, indecently pornographic sexual exploitation that is 
unprotected and harmful for minors.  As it should be understood 
by this Court and by the public after an opinion is released in 
this case, Plaintiffs' hypothetical fears of prosecution for 
protected speech would cease to be any real or conjured 
restraint of free speech.  
	The application of indecency under the CDA to the Internet, 
World Wide Web, Usenet, and within the proprietary services of 
online service providers like America Online, Prodigy, and 
CompuServe, may vary within each of these forums.  It may also 
vary from its application to broadcast, telephone dial-a-porn, 
or cable TV mediums.  An important feature of the indecency 
standard is its ability to adapt to its applicable context, as 
mandated by .i.Pacifica;, supra, 438 U.S. at 750 under the 
nuisance rationale (discussed by Amicus Morality in Media in 
Part II of this Brief, infra).
	As interpreted by the Supreme Court in .i.Pacifica;, by the 
FCC in its decisions finding indecency complaints either well 
taken or worthy of dismissal (for several examples of orders, 
opinions, and letters of liability and of dismissal, see 
Appendix 8, separately bound as Volume 2 of the Appendix 
hereto), and the Department of Justice in these instant suits, 
the indecency standard would not apply to serious uses of merely 
graphic sexual language or medical or artistic nudity or sex.  
	Unlike in the child pornography context, where a photo of a 
child having sexual conduct with another is per se contraband, 
but might still be saved by an overriding serious medical or law 
enforcement purpose as mentioned in .i.Ferber;, indecency 
considers serious value and purpose as part of the consideration 
of whether the treatment is &quot;patently offensive&quot; in context.  
First Amendment protections are preserved by both methods of 
judicially narrowing a law so as not to apply to protected 
speech.  A serious use of otherwise offensive sexual references 
would render it not &quot;patently&quot; indecent to begin with, thus 
avoiding an impermissible application of the indecency standard.  
	As the Court said in .i.Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra, 
408 U.S. at 110 n. 15;:

It will always be true that the fertile legal 
'imagination can conjure up hypothetical cases in 
which the meaning of [disputed] terms will be in nice 
question'.
	Although a reviewing court must construe a statute so as to 
prevent invalid applications, some of which may be merely 
arguably possible though not plausible, this task is not all 
encompassing nor one that cannot vary with time and 
circumstance.  The courts can only announce principles to guide 
future conduct, as all laws do.  When the Supreme Court held 
that some degree of guilty knowledge of the content and 
character of the material involved in an obscenity case was 
required by the Constitution, it did not try to place absolute 
limits or bounds on what type of scienter would be required.  
See  .i.Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 154-55 (1959); (&quot;We 
need not...pass today on what sort of mental element is 
requisite to a constitutionally permissible prosecution....&quot;).  
When faced with a federal statute, however, the Court in 
.i.Hamling v. United States, supra, 418 U.S. at 119-24;, 
provided the parameters of the scienter element.1  
	The Supreme Court recognized that statutory construction 
can sometimes take on a substantial scope, if the situation 
warrants such detailed analysis and authoritative 
interpretation.  As discussed in .i.United States v. 37 
Photographs, supra, 402 U.S. 369-75;, the Court added time 
periods for judicial review of customs forfeitures of allegedly 
obscene material under .i.19 U.S.C. &#167; 1305(a); and held that 
&quot;[s]o construed, &#167; 1305(a) may constitutionally be applied to 
the case before us&quot;. Id. at 374.  The Court prefaced its holding 
by saying that &quot;we do not now decide that these are the only 
constitutionally permissible time limits.  We note, furthermore, 
that constitutionally permissible limits may vary in different 
contexts....&quot; Id.  The Court also discussed how, in order to 
save a statute, the Court may be required to provide 
authorizations to administrative agencies and &quot;create mechanisms 
for carrying it into effect&quot;. Id. at 370.  The Court then 
foreshadowed a recent case mandating limiting construction or 
partial invalidation, rather than wholesale facial invalidity, 
when it said, at 375 n. 3, that if a lower court had thought 
some conduct could be proscribed but that other conduct would be 
protected, that &quot;the proper approach...was not to invalidate the 
section in its entirety, but to construe it narrowly and hold it 
valid in its application to&quot; the valid purpose.  The Court 
continued by stating: &quot;This was made clear in .i.Dombrowski v. 
Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 491-492...(1965);, where the Court noted 
that, once the overbreadth of a statute has been sufficiently 
dealt with, it may be applied to prior conduct foreseeably 
within its valid sweep.&quot; Id.
	The partial invalidity rule was recently underscored in 
.i.Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503-05 
(1985);, where the Ninth Circuit struck down an entire state 
statute because it felt that including &quot;lust&quot; in the definition 
of &quot;prurient&quot; could apply to protected speech which appealed 
only to normal and healthy sexual interests.  Although an 
unhealthy or abnormally lustful interest can properly be 
included in prurience, &quot;had the Court of Appeals thought that 
'lust' refers only to normal sexual appetites, it could have 
excised the word....&quot; Id. at 505 (emphasis in original).  
Nevertheless, the Court held that any improper application of 
the word &quot;lust&quot; should have been limited by declaring such 
applications unconstitutional, not that the law be stricken: 
&quot;Unless there are countervailing considerations, the Washington 
law should have been invalidated only insofar as the word 'lust' 
is to be understood as reaching protected materials.&quot; (emphasis 
added).  
	The Supreme Court also stated the rule of law that should 
guide this Court as to some of the Plaintiffs and witnesses (and 
more appropriately, for many legitimate parties not before the 
Court) who honestly seek to engage in serious discussions of 
sexual disease prevention, legitimate legal or sex education, or 
disseminate valuable artistic or literary works such as are 
found in museums and libraries:

	If the overbreadth is &quot;substantial,&quot; the law may 
not be enforced against anyone, including the party 
before the court, until it is narrowed to reach only 
unprotected activity, whether by legislative action 
or by judicial construction or partial invalidation. 
...
	It is otherwise where the parties challenging 
the statute are those who desire to engage in 
protected speech that the overbroad statute purports 
to punish... The statute may forthwith be declared 
invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but 
otherwise left intact.  Id. at 503-04 [emphasis 
added].

.c.E.	CONGRESS ANTICIPATED THE LEGITIMATE 
PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF ADULTS TO ENGAGE IN 
PROTECTED, BUT INDECENT SPEECH, BUT REQUIRED IT 
TO BE CHANNELED SO THAT CHILDREN ARE ALSO 
PROTECTED.
	The clearly stated intent of Congress and the Act's 
sponsors and supporters is to interpret the CDA narrowly so as 
to save it from impacting truly legitimate, protected expression 
and information on the Internet and computer systems.   The 
&quot;Conference Report on the CDA&quot; is the best evidence of 
legislative intent and clearly states the applicable law and 
First Amendment sensitivities that Congress recognizes as 
important for the Internet.  See  .i.Joint Explanatory Statement 
of the Committee of Conference, Report for P.L. 104-104, Title 
V-Obscenity and Violence, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. Leg. Hist. 200-11; 
(copy in Appendix 2). 
	Congress sought to protect the right of minors to learn and 
benefit from this new global communications tool, not be 
excluded from it as if it were a universal, in-home &quot;adult&quot; 
bookstore full of hard-core pornography as well as soft-core 
pornographic indecency.  Both forms of pornography are harmful 
to minors and the CDA would protect children from either on the 
public areas of the BBS and Internet systems.  These amici 
submit that it is this Court's solemn duty to interpret the 
Communications Decency Act to allow for its constitutional 
application in the protection of children, while preserving 
whatever legitimate rights adults have to communicate indecently 
to other adults.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to take the easy way 
out for them and simply strike the indecency provisions from the 
CDA.  This is not an option unless this Court can find that the 
rule of total invalidity is the only and last resort.  This 
would require a finding, as in .i.Watson v. Buck, 313 U.S. 387, 
401-02 (1941);, that the CDA's proscription against knowingly 
sending indecency to a minor or knowingly displaying such 
patently offensive sexual material on public sites on the 
Internet where it is available to minors as part of the general 
public, without taking good faith efforts to limit the speech to 
adults, is &quot;flagrantly and patently violative of express 
constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and 
paragraph, and in whatever manner and against whomever an effort 
might be made to apply it&quot;.  See .i.Village of Hoffman Estates 
v. Flipside, 455 U.S. 489, 494-95, n. 5 (1982); (holding that 
the law was &quot;invalid in toto -- and therefore incapable of any 
valid application&quot;).   This, we submit, is impossible in light 
of the record before this Court which proves, from witness from 
both parties, that there is hard-core pornography that could be 
considered obscene and other graphically indecent pornography 
freely available to children on the Internet, World Wide Web, 
and especially on the &quot;alt.sex&quot; news groups of the Usenet.  
	A reading of .i.Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 
492 U.S. 115 (1989);, should not lead one to find it analogous 
to the indecency crimes fashioned by the Congress in the CDA.  
The Court in .i.Sable; was forced to review a law that was 
clearly intended &quot;to prohibit indecent as well as obscene 
interstate commercial telephone communications directed to any 
person regardless of age...since a total ban was imposed on 
dial-a-porn, making it illegal for adults, as well as children&quot;. 
Id. at 122-23.  No narrowing construction was possible to remove 
the crime of consensual sale of indecent messages to an adult.  
There, the Court had no choice.  .i.Sable;, however, does not 
mandate a similar remedy for an adult's unwillingness to take 
some steps to obtain indecency in &quot;cyberspace&quot;  so that it is 
not readily accessible to children at the same time.
	The forum for resolution of the complaints and concerns of 
Plaintiffs is in this Court and the burden lies here to do the 
hard construction work necessary to give effect to this 
monumental act of Congress on behalf of children.  Amici submit 
that this is necessary, but sympathize that the task is not so 
easy as Plaintiffs would have it.  Guided by established 
principles of First Amendment due process, and learning from 
past obscenity, harmful to minors, and indecency cases, the CDA 
is and can be fully constitutional.  The last few pages of the 
.i.Pacifica; decision and the application of the pandering and 
scienter cases of the Supreme Court will answer most of the 
legal questions.  Time and technology will have to contribute to 
solving some of the concerns about ease of compliance.  Ease is 
not a constitutional right, however, and this Court should admit 
that at some point an adult must refrain from truly indecent 
speech on the public Internet sites.  With sensitivity to the 
protection and rights of children and to the legitimate 
expression rights of adults, this Court can fashion an order 
which will make the CDA enforceable against truly indecent 
material that reasonable minds would not differ as to its 
inappropriateness for minors on the Internet's public square.


.c.III.	PLAINTIFFS' INTERPRETATION OF THE LEAST 
RESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST IN DETERMINING THE FACIAL 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CDA IS ERRONEOUS AND 
SHOULD BE REJECTED.
	Plaintiffs assert that the CDA is not the least restrictive 
means to further the Government's compelling interest in 
protecting children from exposure to online indecency.  However, 
when Plaintiffs explain the reasons for their conclusion, it 
becomes clear that they have misapplied the sum and substance of 
the least restrictive means test.
	A less restrictive means must be just as effective as the 
means at issue in accomplishing the asserted interest.  It would 
be unreasonable to force Congress to enact legislation which 
allowed a less restrictive, yet ineffective means that would not 
achieve its purpose. The least restrictive means must be 
effective in order for a Congress to achieve its compelling 
interest.
	In .i.Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh;,1 in 
addressing the least restrictive means issue, the Court of 
Appeals stated:  

Accordingly, in order for appellees to prevail, it 
must be determined that there are other approaches 
less restrictive than the Helms Amendment but just as 
effective in achieving its goal of denying access by 
minors to indecent dial-a-porn messages.2    

As to the district court's reference to disobedient 
young people, 'parents and others . . . who have th[e] 
primary responsibility for children's well-being are 
entitled to the support of laws designed to aid 
discharge of that responsibility.  
	The Court cited .i.Ginsberg; and held that &quot;[t]he Helms 
Amendment is such a law, 'narrowly tailored to serve [a 
compelling] interest.'&quot;1.
	Plaintiffs argue for a &quot;less&quot; restrictive means to protect 
children from online indecency than that which the CDA requires.  
However, all that they have suggested are &quot;non&quot;-restrictive, 
some are non-existent, and many are ineffective in restricting 
access by children to the enormous amount of indecent material 
available online.
	The Supreme Court re-articulated the least restrictive 
means test in the context of furthering the Government's 
compelling interest in protecting children from exposure to 
indecency in .i.Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 
(1989);:  &quot;The government may...regulate the content of 
constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a 
compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to 
further the articulated interest.&quot; 
	The least restrictive means test has four components:

&#183;	Government has a legitimate compelling interest
&#183;	Government may regulate to promote this interest
&#183;	The subject of the regulation is speech
&#183;	The means employed by the regulation restricts only 
that speech necessary to fulfill the interest
	Plaintiffs have failed to sustain their burden to show that 
the CDA is not a least restrictive means to accomplish its 
legitimate purpose of shielding minors from online indecency and 
the preliminary injunction should be denied. 

.c.A.	THE GOVERNMENT INTEREST UPON WHICH THE CDA 
IS BASED IS LEGITIMATE AND COMPELLING.
	The ALA Plaintiffs acknowledge that the Government has a 
compelling interest in protecting children from computer 
indecency.  The ACLU Plaintiffs, however, disagree with the 
premise that any government has a compelling interest in 
protecting children from indecent speech.  See .i.ACLU's 
Complaint and the testimony of sex therapist and minister of 
human sexuality, Dr. William R. Stayton, Preliminary Injunction 
Hearing, March 21, 1996, PI Tr. at 200, 208; (testifying that, 
in his opinion, viewing the types of sexually explicit pictures 
in Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler is not harmful to children 
and that videos of sexual intercourse would be appropriate for a 
child: &quot;Yeah, My five-year-old saw them&quot;).
	The ALA Plaintiffs, while conceding that the Government has 
a compelling interest in protecting children from exposure to 
patently offensive depictions of sexual or excretory activities, 
argue that the Government may not employ the CDA's means to 
further its compelling interest.
	This Court need only imagine, if not take judicial notice, 
what is learned in the instant that a young boy or girl, or even 
a teenager, is staring into some of the images brought to this 
Court's attention in the hearings.  The CDA addresses a far more 
pernicious danger to minor children on the Internet than George 
Carlin's monologue of dirty words did on daytime radio.  In 
.i.Pacifica, supra, 438 U.S. 749;, the Supreme Court did not 
panic over the thought that profane political speech on a 
leather jacket could be seen by a few minors who might to be in 
a courthouse during an anti-war demonstration.  The Court did 
state its concern, however, that &quot;Pacifica's broadcast could 
have enlarged a child's vocabulary in an instant&quot; and upheld the 
FCC's judgment that the station's callous disregard for public 
decency and the protection of children was a flagrant 
administrative violation of .i.18 U.S.C. &#167; 1464.;1 
	It can't be overlooked that the Supreme Court has used 
strong language to describe the interests of the States and the 
Congress to protect children by requiring that adults take steps 
not to disseminate &quot;harmful&quot; pornography to them or sexually 
exploit them. See .i.Ginsberg;, .i.Ferber;, and .i.Osborne;, 
supra.  This, it should seem, forewarns a less than sympathetic 
forum in the Supreme Court (than Plaintiffs would have this 
Court believe from their misreading of .i.Sable;, supra) for an 
argument that adults should have a protected right to use the 
Internet's public forums to indiscriminately post patently 
offensive pornography within the instant reach of children from 
coast to coast.

.c.B.	THE GOVERNMENT MAY REGULATE TO FURTHER ITS 
COMPELLING INTEREST.; 
	The Supreme Court has concluded that governments may 
regulate. to protect minors from exposure to non-obscene 
materials in public places.1   Plaintiffs, however, submit that 
the Government should not and, indeed, cannot regulate indecent 
speech in public cyberspace.  Plaintiffs submit, instead, that 
the welfare of children must look only to commercially-available 
optional devices for protection.  In essence, Plaintiffs argue 
that the marketplace is the only possible source for regulation 
of computer indecency.2   Plaintiffs contend that software-
blocking is adequate to protect children and offered Ann Duvall 
of SurfWatch, Inc.  At the conclusion of Mrs. Duvall's 
testimony, Chief Judge Sloviter asked the witness whether 
SurfWatch was a money making project.  &quot;I hope so,&quot; responded 
Duvall.  See .i.PI Tr. at 158 (March 21, 1996);.  Judge Sloviter 
then asked &quot;[T]here's no assurance to the public, the 
Government, parents, that your particular company will remain in 
existence and provide this alternative [to the CDA].  Is that 
right?&quot;  The witness replied:  &quot;That's probably correct.&quot;  Id. 
at  159.   In other words, Plaintiffs claim that the Government 
may take steps to fulfill its compelling interest in protecting 
children from pornography in every other medium, including 
print, video, television, radio and the private telephone, but 
as to computers connected via telephone and other communication 
lines, the Government may do nothing but leave it up to the 
market and to voluntary measures to further its compelling 
interest.1 
	This concept of the market as a self-regulator can be 
seductive, but it is not a legal substitute for obeying the law.  
Still, good faith attempts at compliance can even be helpful, 
since the market should respond and comply with the social 
policy embodied in the law.  The market is not known for 
protecting the vulnerable nor tempering the ambitious or 
exploitive, as noted in .i.Pacifica;, supra, n. 8, and the law 
does not require child safety to be left entirely to the whim of 
good will or the ability of parents to protect their children 
from those who prey. 
	In addition, if the Government were to do nothing to 
prevent children's access to online pornography, that disregard 
would contribute to and become part of the harm visited upon the 
young and impressionable.  In .i.Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 
629 (1968);, the Supreme Court upheld a state &quot;harmful to 
minors&quot; statute prohibiting the sale of certain sexually 
explicit material to minors under the age of 17.  The Court 
quoted Dr. Gaylin of Columbia University Psychoanalytic Clinic 
on the harmful impact of sexually explicit material on minors, 
wherein he emphasized that &quot;a child might not be as well 
prepared as an adult to make an intelligent choice as to the 
matter he chooses to read.&quot;  Id. at 643.  The Court noted that 
psychiatrists have made a distinction between the harm to 
children from reading pornography and &quot;the permitting of the 
reading of pornography, which was conceived as potentially 
destructive.  The child is protected in his reading of 
pornography by the knowledge that it is pornography, i.e. 
disapproved.&quot;  Id. (emphasis added).  The Court cited Dr. Gaylin 
further:  &quot;To openly permit implies parental approval and even 
suggests seductive encouragement.  If this is so of parental 
approval, it is equally so of societal approval -- another 
potent influence on the developing ego.&quot;  Id. (emphasis added).  
In .i.Ginsberg;, the Court got right to the heart of the matter:  
an essential part of government's furthering its compelling 
interest in protecting children from exposure to online 
pornography is &quot;official&quot; societal disapproval -- through laws 
in which this disapproval is manifested -- not only of children 
consuming pornography, but especially of adults providing it to 
them.
	That government, which has always regulated in furtherance 
of its compelling interests, could do nothing to further this 
compelling interest in the world of computers would be an 
enormous departure from precedent and is unjustified.
	 
.c.C.	THE SUBJECT OF THE REGULATION IS THE 
SPEECH, NOT THE CONSUMER OF THE SPEECH.
	In a least restrictive means analysis, the subject of the 
regulation is the speech.  Plaintiffs' challenge has the effect 
of making the subject of the regulation be the consumer of the 
speech.  These amici submit that Plaintiffs have failed to show 
why the law should now be powerless to deal with users of 
computers as it does with users of phones, radio and TV systems, 
satellites, common carriers, and all other means and facilities 
of commerce and communication.  Plaintiffs' position is legally 
indistinguishable from the &quot;consenting adults&quot; argument rejected 
by the Supreme Court in .i.Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton, 413 
U.S. 49, 57 (1973); (&quot;[W]e hold that there are legitimate state 
interests at stake in stemming the tide of commercialized 
obscenity, even assuming it is feasible to enforce effective 
safeguards against exposure to juveniles and to passersby.  
Rights and interests 'other than those of the advocates are 
involved.'&quot;), and .i.Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115, 120 
(1973); (&quot;[W]e can take note of the tendency of widely 
circulated books of this category to reach the impressionable 
young and have a continuing impact.&quot;).  Though the Court there 
dealt with an argument against the validity of obscenity laws, 
the Court's reasoning that pornography is harmful and available 
to children belies the Plaintiffs' position that publicly posted 
computer pornography can be blocked by adults by simply keeping 
them out of such electronic places.1
	The Court in .i.Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 
938 F.2d 1535 (2nd Cir. 1991), cert. denied 502 U.S. 1072 
(1992);, upheld the requirement that the &quot;speaker&quot; of indecent 
telephone speech bear the burden of keeping his speech away from 
children, despite the existence of commercially available 
blocking devices.  The Court upheld the 1989 amendment, known as 
the Helms amendment, that established a &quot;safe harbor&quot; defense 
for dial-a-porn providers who comply with telephone company 
presubscription procedures or engage in independent billing and 
collection, all speaker-based actions. Id.  
	Recently in the .i.Alliance; case, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the assertion that 
indecent programming on leased access cable channels should be 
&quot;regulated&quot; only by parents who obtain &quot;lockboxes&quot; from cable 
operators.  .i.Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 
(D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. granted, 116 S.Ct. 471 (1995) (argued 
Feb. 21, 1996);.  For the Internet, Plaintiffs attempt to shift 
the burden of mitigating harmful speech from the speaker to the 
consumer of the speech.  In other words, Plaintiffs seek to 
absolve online content providers of any responsibility to 
protect children from pornography they create or distribute, and 
instead place it in the lap of the consumer-victims, the 
children and their parents.  This the law and the courts need 
not and should not accede to.
	The location of the regulatory burden upon the speaker and 
not the consumer of the speech not only carries the weight of 
unanimous precedent, but also has the benefit of being 
practical.  It is almost a truism to say that, as between 
speaker and consumer, the speaker is in the better position to 
know the content of his speech.1  The consumer of the speech 
(under the CDA) does not know its content until it is &quot;consumed&quot; 
by a child, as in .i.Pacifica;.  Plaintiffs would remove the 
obligation of those who already know where the material under 
their control is located and who are in the best position to 
know whether it contains patently offensive depictions of sexual 
or excretory activities, and would instead create the enormous 
and nearly impossible burden for the consumer to locate, 
identify, and block children's access to the multiple thousands 
of sites where pornographic material is located. 
	Expecting children to locate hidden Easter eggs sounds 
reasonable and enjoyable, unless those who have hidden the eggs 
are aware that they are rotten.  No reasonable person, who cares 
about the well-being of children, would leave it up to children 
to find and dispose of rotten eggs.  In the world of online 
communications, parents will be left as children, hunting 
frantically for thousands upon thousands of rotten eggs in a 
cyberworld of indecency, scurrying to find all of them before 
their children are contaminated.
	Plaintiffs would have this Court decide not only that the 
Government may do no more than hope that parents purchase and 
install blocking software in the family computer, but that this is all that 
is necessary to protect children from online indecency.  The least 
restrictive means of accomplishing the Government's compelling 
interest must also be effective.  Ignoring for a moment the fatal flaw 
inherent in the argument that the Government may do nothing, these 
amici find the ineffectiveness of Plaintiffs' suggested &quot;means&quot; to be 
obvious.1   The ACLU Plaintiffs themselves admit that these programs 
are ineffective in protecting children from accessing computer 
indecency.1  After making this concession, ACLU Plaintiffs then make 
the unsupported assertion that &quot;the various blocking mechanisms are 
much more effective than a government ban in keeping minors away 
from material that their parents and teachers deem inappropriate.&quot;  
.i.[ACLU] Plaintiffs' Brief in Support of a Motion for TRO and Prelim. Inj., 
at 24;.  This type of reasoning presents a false conflict.  Nothing in the 
CDA prevents or even discourages the development and use of 
commercial parental software blocking devices.  In fact, this Court 
should find that it was the Exon-Coats bill that spurred industry into 
action in this regard.  Even Plaintiffs should agree that the CDA and 
software filters together would be more effective in protecting minors 
than would either alone, even though they would argue that such 
effectiveness is not constitutionally permissible or necessary.  Moreover, 
even if parents were very effective in finding indecent sexually explicit 
material before their children found it, the government would still have 
a legitimate, constitutionally-sound and compelling reason to 
discourage, through law or regulation, adults from knowingly or 
intentionally distributing or displaying indecent sexual material to 
children.  If all parents were encouraged to keep their children 
continuously inside the home, they could be very effective at 
preventing child molestation, but the Government would still have a 
proper role in prohibiting child molestation through criminal laws 
discouraging would-be molesters.
	Still, the question of the effectiveness of Plaintiffs' 
suggested &quot;means&quot; is just not relevant.  The only relevant 
question is whether the regulation imposed by the Government 
through the CDA is the least restrictive, yet effective means of 
protecting children from accessing online indecency. 


.c.IV.	&quot;INDECENCY&quot; IS A VALID STANDARD FOR THE 
INTERNET AND OTHER INTERACTIVE COMPUTER SERVICES.
	The Indecency standard as a prohibition on the public 
dissemination of patently offensive representations and 
references to sex and nudity derives from the test for obscenity 
and is a sufficiently definite term of art so as to give notice 
and guidance to all as to what manner of sexual description or 
depiction must be channeled to adults on publicly accessible 
sites on the Internet, bulletin board systems, and other 
interactive computer services.  As interpreted and applied by 
the FCC as a prohibition on broadcast communications under .i.18 
U.S.C. &#167; 1464;, the indecency standard has been part of American 
life since radio and television came into every home, school, 
office, and vehicle.  What is &quot;indecent&quot; is well known to the 
public and the operators of mass communications media 
facilities.1    Indecency is thus ingrained into American 
culture by the presence of mass communications that are held to 
the level of public decency that all citizens are familiar with 
and derives from the application of the indecency standard.  
	Just as everyone is presumed to know the law and the law is 
presumed to know what everyone knows, adults in America know 
from their sense of common decency and from their universal 
experience with radio and television what types of words and 
pictures are &quot;indecent&quot; in such mass communications forums.  
Such a practical and common sense judgment as to public 
expression has made American TV, radio, and telephone services 
accessible to all those who wish to access them, whether 
selectively or incidentally.  No one need avoid the public media 
for fear of being offended by pornographic descriptions or 
nudity and parents need not shield from nor deprive their 
children of the programming that is openly available and 
displayed to the general public. 

.c.A.	THE INDECENCY STANDARD IS APPROPRIATE FOR 
A PUBLIC FORUM, SUCH AS THE PUBLIC AREAS OF THE 
INTERNET.
	Plaintiffs admit that the Internet is the future's most 
public forum.  The ACLU Plaintiffs, in their Brief supporting a 
preliminary injunction and TRO, at 10, state: 

Online networks represent a revolutionary synthesis 
of several traditional means of communication and 
places for communicating and exchanging information--
including the telephone system, the postal service, a 
television or radio broadcast, a newspaper, a library 
or book store, a fax machine, a town hall or public 
park, and a shopping mall.  

The ALA Plaintiffs, in the preliminary statement, p. 1, of their 
Complaint, state: &quot;The public square of the past...is being 
replaced by the Internet....&quot;  It is hard to claim in the face 
of these core admissions that the interactive computer systems 
are not public or not pervasive or are not as uniquely 
accessible to children or will be more so in the future.  In 
fact, in all other public forums and places to which both sets 
of Plaintiffs claim to be incorporated or replaced online, minor 
children are protected by indecency or harmful to minors 
transaction prohibitions, display and/or access provisions, 
and/or time, place, and manner restrictions.  The CDA would 
simply extend the same duties into the computer communications 
medium that public decency and protection of minors laws do in 
every other public medium.  
	Amici submit that the standard of indecency on the Internet 
would be even more permissive than public broadcasting and would 
therefore allow unrestricted public availability for virtually 
all that which one could say on radio or TV, sell to a minor in 
a store or in a mall, wear on one's jacket in the street or 
park, provide to a minor by phone, fax, mail, cable, or in 
school, library, or museum.  If a treatment of sex or nudity is 
so patently offensive that average adults could agree, and has 
no serious value or purpose or is pandered as prurient 
pornography, then its indecency is evident and its harmful 
nature would make it illegal to provide to minors anywhere off-
line and, thus, should likewise cause it to be restricted from 
minors online.  The burden falls on adults to comply with all 
other public decency provisions to shield children from such 
inappropriate and harmful matter and the same duty applies to 
the Internet.  Adults must channel or avoid indecent speech 
where and when children are in the audience.   
	As we enter the next century, the importance and 
pervasiveness of computer systems and technologies will grow, no 
doubt about it, and their accessibility to children and 
importance to them will also grow.  Cable, satellite, and phone 
assisted audio-visual systems, as well as the Internet, will 
dictate that such mass media facilities be available to the 
entire public, young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural.  
The Internet will be too important for it to be made &quot;off 
limits&quot; to minors because of patently offensive pornography on 
public access boards or sites.  The Internet does not belong to 
plaintiffs or porn pirates, but to all of us.  The indecency 
standard can protect children from the most offensive material 
while permitting consenting adults to avail themselves of such 
pornography in less public places, where appropriate 
restrictions to shield children have been implemented (or in 
other electronic hiding places in the dark corners of the Web).

	.c.B.	INDECENCY IS NOT AND CANNOT BE VAGUE OR 
OVERBROAD.
	The question of determining what material is indecent and 
off-limits to minors is not burdensome.  Retail stores place 
&quot;men's sophisticate&quot; soft-core pornography magazines behind the 
counter, behind a blinder rack, in shrink wrap plastic, on a top 
shelf, on a rack from which an adult can monitor and keep kids 
from congregating or reaching the matter that is &quot;harmful to 
minors&quot;.  Everyone knows which magazines go into this display 
treatment, since all adults have witnessed that the men's &quot;skin&quot; 
mags are together out of reach of children and not displayed 
next to magazines on news, sports, women's issues, fashion, 
cars, comics, etc.  Likewise, what is commonly found proper to 
provide children as part of serious medical, sexual, disease, or 
social education will be no less proper or any more offensive on 
the Internet.  There simply is no legitimate basis for hysteria 
or fear that truly protected speech for minors in any other 
media or forum would be prohibited from the same display 
electronically online.
	Indecency as a governing standard is the functional 
equivalent of the second prong of the &quot;Miller Test&quot; on patent 
offensiveness.1 The difference is not in the manner of its 
application, but upon the types of acts or words to which it can 
be applied and the contexts in which it is applied.  The 
obscenity test was stated to apply to &quot;hard-core sexual conduct&quot; 
of the types given as &quot;Miller Examples&quot;,1 whereas the indecency 
test is applied to sex and nudity in mass communications when 
amounting to &quot;patently offensive references to excretory and 
sexual organs and activities.&quot;2  It is the purpose to be served 
by each standard that distinguishes the scope and breadth of 
their applications.  	The obscenity test was designed to 
provide &quot;concrete guidelines to isolate 'hard-core' pornography 
from expression protected by the First Amendment&quot;. .i.Miller, 
413 U.S. at 29.;3  Because obscenity is unprotected in all 
streams of commerce and public access, its patently offensive 
representations of sexual conduct and genital exposure must also 
be designed to appeal to a prurient interest4 and lack serious 
literary, artistic, political, and scientific value,1 as a 
matter of law and fact.  
	As a further guarantee that First Amendment principles 
applicable to both obscenity and indecency, as presumptively 
protected expression, will prevent the indecency standard from 
being overbroad in its reach and encompass serious, non-
pornographic materials, this Court can also point to the Supreme 
Court's guidance in .i.Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 161 
(1974);, and .i.Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 
213-14, 216 n. 15 (1975);.  In .i.Jenkins, at 161;, the Court 
held that the movie &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; &quot;could not be found under 
the Miller standards to depict sexual conduct in a patently 
offensive way&quot; even though a jury might have thought so.  As in 
indecency, the standard is a constitutional test but the 
independent supervision of trial courts and the required 
appellate review places substantive limitations on the reach of 
the standard, as a matter of law.  .i.Jenkins; explained, Id., 
that:

While the subject matter of the picture is, in a 
broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which 
sexual conduct including &quot;ultimate sexual acts&quot; is to 
be understood to be taking place, the camera does not 
focus on the bodies of the actors at such times.  
There is no exhibition whatever of the actors 
genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes.  
There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity 
alone is not enough to make material legally obscene 
under the Miller standards.

	Likewise, in .i.Erznoznik, at 216 n. 15;, the Court held 
that a city's nude display ordinance for drive-in screens could 
not stand, since it was not narrowed by the state to apply to 
that which was &quot;harmful to minors&quot; and banned all nudity to both 
adults and minors.  As explained at 213-14:

The ordinance is not directed against sexually 
explicit nudity, nor is it otherwise limited.  
Rather, it sweepingly forbids display of all films 
containing any uncovered buttocks or breasts, 
irrespective of context or pervasiveness. ... 
Clearly, all nudity cannot be deemed obscene even as 
to minors.  See Ginsberg v. New York, supra. ... 
Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor 
subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot 
be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas 
or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable 
for them.

	These laws were not held vague, but rather their 
application was overbroad so as to reach protected speech as to 
adults in .i.Jenkins; and even as to minors in .i.Erznoznik;.  
Likewise, the test for indecency, having its roots in the 
&quot;Miller Test&quot;, is not unconstitutionally vague, as found by the 
Supreme Court in .i.Pacifica; and .i.Sable; and by the Courts of 
Appeals in .i.Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 
1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992);; 
.i.Information Providers' Coalition For Defense of the First 
Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991);(upholding 
criminal prohibition on transmission of indecent communication 
to persons under 18 through telephone facilities); .i.Alliance 
for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105, 129 (D.C. Cir. 1995), 
cert. granted, 116 S. Ct. 471 (1995);(upholding requirement that 
indecent programming on leased access channels be blocked to 
prevent access by minors).
	Applying the indecency standard does not require 
affirmative or ancillary proof of prurience or lack of value, as 
in obscenity, since &quot;the normal definition of 'indecent' merely 
refers to nonconformance with accepted standards of morality&quot; 
and &quot;'indecency' as a shorthand term for 'patent 
offensiveness'...[is] a usage strikingly similar to the 
Commission's definition in this case.&quot;  .i.FCC v. Pacifica 
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 740, n. 15 (1978);.  However, the 
Court in .i.Pacifica, at 750;, held that &quot;context is all-
important&quot;.  Therefore, the standard of what is indecent 
includes a consideration of any serious value or purpose in 
making a judgment on patent offensiveness and the FCC, 
Department of Justice, and the courts would also consider any 
intentional pandering to the prurient interest as evidence that 
a claim of serious value was unwarranted or that the 
offensiveness of the material itself is more apparent.1  
	Indecency is an inherently variable standard that accounts 
for the time, place, manner, and context in which it is 
exhibited for a determination on a specific circumstance whether 
a particular program is &quot;indecent&quot; or not in that setting.  No 
&quot;safe harbor&quot; is even needed, since what may be indecent at 
three o'clock in the afternoon may not be indecent at three 
o'clock in the middle of the night.1  The Supreme Court mandated 
such variable &quot;nuisance rationale&quot; application of the indecency 
standard in .i.Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750;, when it held:

The Commission's decision rested entirely on a 
nuisance rationale under which context is all-
important.  The concept requires consideration of a 
host of variables.  The time of day was emphasized by 
the Commission.  The content of the program in which 
the language is used will also affect the composition 
of the audience, and differences between radio, 
television, and perhaps closed-circuit transmissions, 
may also be relevant.

	People do not have to &quot;turn away&quot; or tune out or forego use 
of broadcast media in their homes, as they may in other more 
publicly available settings outside the home.  .i.Pacifica, 438 
U.S. at 749 n. 27;.  As stated in .i.Pacifica, at 748-50;, the 
reasons for distinguishing broadcast media are twofold and 
include both the rights of the adult public as well as the 
juvenile public.  The CDA chose only to prohibit the knowing 
transmission or display of indecent material to minors, not 
unconsenting adults, so the offense is even narrower than under 
.i.18 U.S.C. &#167; 1464;.1    

.c.V.	COMPLIANCE WITH THE CDA IS POSSIBLE AND NOT 
UNREASONABLE.
	First, despite plaintiffs' repeated characterization of the 
CDA as a &quot;ban&quot; of indecency in cyberspace, the CDA, on its face, 
does not ban indecency.  The CDA does no more than that which is 
necessary to further the compelling interest in protecting 
children from accessing online indecency: prohibit adults from 
knowingly distributing or displaying to minors online patently 
offensive depictions or descriptions of sexual or excretory 
activities or organs.  Thus, the liability provisions of the CDA 
are, on their face, constitutional restrictions.  
	Moreover, the defenses in the CDA further narrow its reach, 
and ensure that no more speech than necessary is burdened.  In 
.i.Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, supra, 492 
U.S. 115 (1989);, the Supreme Court upheld the ban on obscene 
commercial dial-a-porn under .i.47 U.S.C. 223 (b);, as amended 
by Congress in 1988, but struck down the total ban of indecent 
dial-a-porn.  The Court applied its holding in .i.FCC v. 
Pacifica Foundation;, supra,1 and validated the FCC regulations, 
enacted in 1988, which provided defenses to prosecution for 
dial-a-porn providers.  The &quot;credit card, access code, and 
scrambling rules were a satisfactory solution to the problem of 
keeping indecent dial-a-porn messages out of the reach of 
minors....[A] 'feasible and effective' way to serve the 
Government's compelling interest in protecting children.&quot;2  
(Emphasis added.)
	In order to avail themselves of the good faith defenses in 
.i.&#167; 223 (e)(5)(A);, a provider whose content is indecent, and 
is knowingly available to minors, should have to demonstrate 
that he or she: 

has taken good faith, reasonable, effective, and 
appropriate actions under the circumstances to 
restrict or prevent access by minors to a 
communication specified in such subsections, which may 
involve any appropriate measures to restrict minors 
from such communications, including any method which 
is feasible under available technology; or has 
restricted access to such communication by requiring 
use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult 
access code, or adult personal identification number.
	Though the testimony is disputed between the parties, there 
is evidence in the record to show that there ways to comply with 
the CDA that are presently available, other means that are 
technically possible and trivial to institute, and there will 
undoubtedly be more and easier ways to comply in the future.  
Potential mechanisms of compliance include:
	1) designing system-wide protocols which allow screening of 
children (this is much less complex than designing an electronic 
system of commerce and billing to enable consumers to buy and 
sell products/services via the Internet -- a process the 
industry is vigorously working on with no complaints that it's 
&quot;impossible&quot;), 
	2) server level screening, such as the &quot;Exon Machine&quot; 
technology as dubbed by the Interactive Week report of March 25, 
1996 (copy in Appendix 5) 
	3) agreement on an &quot;L18&quot; or digital ID or access provider 
user ID or some other mechanism or combination of ID devices 
which allow content providers to identify adult visitors to 
their sites, pages, or GIFs and thereby exclude children, 
	4) simply removing patently offensive depictions of sexual 
or excretory activities from universally available public areas 
of the Internet to private electronic spaces where access is 
controlled (since there is no constitutional right to distribute 
bestiality or any other pornography that is harmful to minors or 
indecent in the immediate presence of minor children).
	Content providers, who have not already done so, could 
identify their newsgroups, postings, chat rooms, Bulletin 
Boards, Web pages, etc., and block access to children if the 
material is indecent.  The material available online is already 
identified to some degree and is indexed by directories as well 
as browsers.1    
	For example, a site might be currently identified as, &quot;AIDS 
Information-Sexually Explicit.&quot;  If the site proved to be what 
its name indicated, then, in &quot;context&quot;, it may have serious 
scientific value, although sexually explicit, and would not be 
&quot;indecent.&quot;  Therefore, a minor could legally access the site, 
and the good faith defenses would be unnecessary.  
Alternatively, if a site were identified, &quot;Alt.sex.bestiality&quot;, 
to add an appropriate tag (&quot;-L18&quot;), and require some form of 
adult verification: a credit card number, PIN, access code, 
etc., to block access to minors would be both reasonable, 
effective, and the least restrictive means of accomplishing 
Congress' compelling interest.2  (However, 
&quot;alt.binaries.pictures.erotica...&quot;, with no restriction, it is 
as now, is a magnet that attracts, rather than repels, 
children.)  
	If a minor is somehow able to access the site despite the 
blocking provisions in place, the good faith defenses would 
apply.  In addition, adults would be on notice of the kinds of 
material offered at the site, and could avoid any material which 
they would not choose to access.
	Many existing sites available via the Internet already 
identify content according to its general category, e.g., 
&quot;alt.sex.bestiality&quot; or &quot;alt.binaries.pictures.erotica. 
bestiality.&quot;  &quot;No new technology&quot; is required for adding &quot;-L18&quot; 
to the listing.1  Requiring content providers to identify 
pornography through an appropriate tagging mechanism is not 
unduly burdensome in light of the Government's compelling 
interest in shielding children from such material.  Indeed, 
&quot;tagging&quot; such material would assist adults who want to access 
pornography and, at the same time, it would allow providers to 
restrict such material from children. 
	The &quot;Internet Yellow Pages&quot; lists specific pornographic 
sites.2  The Yellow Pages also identifies content by categories, 
e.g., &quot;Sex&quot;, with sub categories that indicate the information 
is sexually explicit (and could be patently offensive), e.g., 
&quot;Amputee Fetish,&quot; &quot;Bestiality,&quot; &quot;Watersports.&quot;3  The Internet 
Yellow Pages, therefore, is just one way in which content 
providers can find the pornographic sites in order to restrict 
them from minor subscribers. 
	The ALA's assertion that they would have to spend 100,000 
dollars to hire people to read every book to find any 
pornography in the library is absurd.  Numerous indexing and 
categorizing resources are available which help identify 
pornographic content available via the Internet or in &quot;adult&quot; 
bookstores.  It would be very surprising to find any of this 
hard-core pornography in a public library.  Certainly, listing a 
library's card catalogue on the Internet would not be patently 
offensive.  Therefore, libraries have virtually no burden 
imposed by the CDA.  
	The Plaintiffs' assertions, that the Internet, World Wide 
Web, and Usenet offer no reasonable means to identify sites is 
patently false. This is a matter of doctrine, not feasibility.  
The content of the material available on the Internet, the World 
Wide Web, the Usenet, and Bulletin Board Services is completely 
unregulated only because the content providers have refused to 
regulate themselves, but the existing protocols and standards 
are certainly not anarchic.1  
	For example, &quot;FTP&quot; (File Transfer Protocol) is one 
electronic procedure by which a computer connects with another 
computer to access and retrieve information.1   It requires 
adherence to the &quot;standard&quot; computer &quot;address&quot; identifiers, much 
like an area code and number identifier acts as a phone's 
&quot;address&quot; in the telephone medium.  One may call from Los 
Angeles to New York City only if using the prescribed area code.  
Without its use, no telephone connection with New York City can 
be made.
	The commercial, educational, institutional, and corporate 
online service providers, in addition to being an ISP and 
providing access to the Internet and World Wide Web, can and 
usually do offer material over which they have editorial control 
(services, boards, chat rooms, pages, etc.).  A service provider 
must also exercise conscious and deliberate subscription control 
over which commercial or privately owned services it will take 
onto its own server(s) in order to re-offer it to its customers 
or users.  For example, each service provider must choose which 
Usenet feeds to accept (i.e., whether to take or subscribe to 
all the &quot;alt&quot; hierarchies, or all but &quot;alt.sex&quot;, or some of 
those but not &quot;alt.sex.bestiality&quot; or &quot;alt.sex.pedophilia&quot; or 
others).  A provider must decide which commercial services to 
subscribe to, such as encyclopedias, magazines (Time, Newsweek, 
Playboy, Hustler, etc.), other news or financial data services 
(AP, UPI, Reuters, NY Times, NYSE, NASDAC, etc.).  Many 
commercial &quot;BBSs&quot; (Bulletin Board Services) do the same and 
either use the Internet to advertise their BBS telephone number 
(as did the defendants in the .i.W.D. Tenn./6th Cir. case of 
U.S. v. Thomas; involving the &quot;Amateur Action BBS&quot;) or contract 
to have their board's content offered by a commercial online 
content or access provider.
	The defenses provided in the CDA are both all inclusive of 
true &quot;good faith&quot; efforts and allow for more defenses than are 
available under any other federal indecency law, including 
broadcasting, cablecasting, or dial-a-porn.  The CDA not only 
incorporates the defenses applicable to the dial-a-porn offenses 
in .i.&#167; 223 (b)&amp;(c);, which were promulgated by the FCC and 
specifically referred to with approval by the Supreme Court in 
.i.Sable;, but the CDA also provides good faith defenses to 
those who take steps of their own device or choosing in order to 
protect minors from indecent material or who comply with future 
FCC approved defensive methods, if any.
	For purposes of legal analysis of the current regulatory 
scheme, there is a significant difference between impossibility 
of compliance and an unwillingness to comply with Congress' 
clear intent.
	1) Many of the Plaintiffs concede in their submissions to 
this Court that they could screen children from areas or 
specific electronic addresses which pander pornographic 
materials.  Their objection is that they ought not to bear the 
legal responsibility of implementing any screening mechanisms as 
content providers.  The argument is the equivalent of an adult 
bookstore/peepshow owner complaining that the law requires him 
to exclude children from the confines of the store. See .i.Paris 
Adult Theatre, supra, 413 U.S. at 57 n. 19;.
	2) With respect to speech in a public space, with 
significant children in the audience, providers of patently 
offensive sexual or excretory depictions rightly bear the burden 
(including some increase in economic compliance costs) of 
shielding children from this material.  Society's interest is 
compelling. See .i.Ginsberg, Sable, Alliance;, supra.
	3) For those unwilling to implement any mechanisms to 
protect children from patently offensive depictions of sexual of 
excretory activity in widely available public areas of the 
Internet, they still have the option of taking their materials 
to electronic spaces which are private or which choose to 
exclude children as a matter of policy. (As retail stores and 
theaters do with &quot;adult&quot; materials that are made available to 
adults but displayed out of reach of minors.)
	4) Commercial bulletin board services provide adults with 
thousands of additional outlets to electronically disseminate 
hard and soft core pornography in areas easily restricted from 
children. See .i.United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701 (6th Cir. 
1996);.
	5) Plaintiffs' objection to shielding children from 
patently offensive depictions of sexual or excretory activity 
here is philosophical, not technical.  Plaintiffs may take 
positions that the law can't or shouldn't apply to them, that 
indecency shouldn't exist as a category of regulated speech 
regarding minors online, or that it's even beneficial to show 5 
year olds sexually explicit pornography.  It is no surprise that 
several Plaintiffs complained that technical compliance is 
difficult or impossible. It demonstrates the need for legal 
sanction for those distributors of patently offensive depictions 
of sexual or excretory activity unwilling to take any 
responsibility to help protect children. 
	Purely selfish motivations based on one's desire to rebel 
against the &quot;government&quot; and be free from society's code of 
conduct in &quot;cyberspace&quot; is not a legal justification that should 
be accepted by the courts, including the present tribunal


VI.	THE CDA IS A REASONABLE TIME, PLACE, AND MANNER 
REGULATION.
	The CDA is really more like a content-neutral time, place, 
and manner regulation because it does not affect the content or 
message of speech, does not affect serious sexual speech and as 
such, it is constitutional.
	Content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations pose a 
less substantial risk of excising certain ideas or viewpoints 
from the public dialogue.  .i.Clark v. Community for Creative 
Non-Violence;.1  
	In .i.Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., et al. v. F.C.C.;,2 
the Supreme Court gave instruction to courts when deciding 
whether a regulation is content-based or content-neutral.  
&quot;Deciding whether a particular regulation is content-based or 
content-neutral is not always a simple task.  We have said that 
the 'principal inquiry in determining content-neutrality . . . 
is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech 
because of [agreement or] disagreement with the message it 
conveys.&quot;  .i.Ward v. Rock Against Racism;, [citation].'&quot;
	The purpose of Congress in enacting the CDA and the effect 
of the CDA have nothing whatsoever to do with the Government's 
&quot;agreement or disagreement with the message&quot; conveyed by 
indecent online speakers.  The purpose and effect of the 
regulation is to protect children from harmful material.  
Distribution of indecent computer speech is not illegal between 
adults.  The sole focus and purpose of the CDA is preventing 
crime, i.e., the distribution of harmful indecent material to 
minors.  The CDA is akin to the content-neutral time, place, and 
manner regulation focused on reducing and eliminating the 
adverse secondary effects of &quot;adult&quot; businesses addressed in 
.i.Young;, .i.Renton;, and their progeny, which have been 
consistently upheld by the courts.
	The Supreme Court held, in .i.Ward v. Rock Against 
Racism;,1 that &quot;[w]hile time, place or manner regulations must 
also be narrowly tailored in order to survive First Amendment 
challenge, we have never applied strict scrutiny in this 
context.&quot;2  
	In .i.Portland Fem. Women's H. Ctr. v. Advocates For 
Life;,3 the court held that the limitation on anti-abortion 
protests: 

is not a content-based restriction of expression. . . 
. Rather, it focuses exclusively on the location and 
manner of expression.  Pro-Choice Network v. Project 
Rescue, supra, [citation].  [Injunction limiting pro-
life protest activities 'is content-neutral'. . . .  
It regulates when, where and how defendants may 
speak, but not what they may say.]  [T]he fact that 
the injunction covered people with a particular 
viewpoint does not itself render the injunction 
content or viewpoint based.4
	In .i.M.S. News v. Casado;,1 a harmful to minors display 
case, a facial and as applied challenge was made to the section 
of the statute which prohibited &quot;promotion&quot; of harmful to minors 
materials through the use of &quot;blinder racks.&quot;
	The Court of Appeals held that the statute was &quot;conduct 
plus speech&quot; because it regulated the manner in which material 
can be disseminated, and therefore, required a finding of 
substantial over breadth on its face.  &quot;We find no such 
infirmity.&quot;2   

Reasonable time, place and manner regulations are 
permissible where the regulations are necessary to 
further significant governmental interests, Young v. 
American Mini Theatres, [citations] . . . .Similarly 
the display provision of the Wichita ordinance is a 
regulation based on content.  We believe that it is 
likewise justified by the substantial governmental 
interest in protecting minors from exposure to 
harmful adult material.3 
	In .i.Upper Midwest Booksellers v. City of Minneapolis;,4 
The Eighth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of a display 
ordinance which required sealing of any material harmful to 
minors displayed for commercial purposes.
	&quot;Any burden here is the result of the permissible 
regulation of material that is obscene as to minors.  The 
restriction in relation to adults is merely an incidental effect 
of the permissible regulation and is minimal in its impact.&quot;1
	In the present case, that the CDA is only applicable to 
indecent material does not mean that the regulation is content-
based.  In .i.Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc.;,2 the 
Supreme Court upheld the right of municipalities to regulate 
&quot;adult&quot; theaters, which exhibited sexually explicit films 
presumptively protected by the First Amendment, in a more 
stringent way than other theaters.  &quot;We hold that the State may 
legitimately use the content of these materials as the basis for 
placing them in a different classification from other motion 
pictures.&quot;3  
	The CDA regulates &quot;how&quot; the Plaintiffs may distribute their 
indecent computer speech.  It does not regulate &quot;what they may 
say.&quot;  .i.Young;, supra.
	The tobacco industry is prevented by federal and state law 
from targeting minors by their advertising, despite their First 
Amendment objections.4  If the tobacco or alcoholic beverage 
industry even attempted to place their products, which are 
illegal to sell to minors, in unattended vending machines on 
public sidewalks, they would face criminal prosecution and 
public outrage immediately.  
	The CDA is a valid, content-neutral time, place, and manner 
regulation focused on eliminating the adverse secondary effect 
of crime, i.e., the distribution to minors of harmful indecent 
material to minors.  It serves a substantial state interest and 
does not unreasonably limit plaintiffs' alternative avenues of 
communication.  The CDA has no effect on the content of 
plaintiffs' speech nor does it prevent adults from obtaining it.

.c.VI.	SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED FOR COMPLIANCE 
WITH A LAW DO NOT AFFECT ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY.
	The ALA plaintiffs argue that the CDA defenses &quot;do not 
provide a technologically or economically feasible means for 
most Internet speakers to shield themselves from liability.&quot;1    
Whether the defenses are economically feasible is not 
dispositive for First Amendment analysis and should be rejected 
as irrelevant under present situation.  American Online or 
CompuServe or Prodigy could give all its subscribers an adult ID 
code for free and do it immediately, it's just not the way they 
do things right now that's all.  For most good faith efforts, it 
could be free or cheap.  If not yet, then take down the 
pornography, leave up the serious works, and it won't cost 
anything.
	The Court in .i.Sable;, supra made it clear that additional 
costs incurred by the providers of sexual expression, in order 
to comply with the law, did not affect the constitutionality of 
the statute:
	
Furthermore, Sable is free to tailor its messages, on 
a selective basis, if it so chooses, to the 
communities it chooses to serve.  While Sable may be 
forced to incur some costs in developing and 
implementing a system for screening the locale of 
incoming calls, there is no constitutional impediment 
to enacting a law which may impose such costs on a 
medium electing to provide these messages.  Whether 
Sable chooses to hire operators to determine the 
source of the calls or engages with the telephone 
company to arrange for the screening and blocking of 
out-of-area calls or finds another means for providing 
messages compatible with community standards is a 
decision for the message provider to make.  There is 
no constitutional barrier under Miller to prohibiting 
communications that are obscene in some communities 
under local standards even though they are not obscene 
in others.  If Sable's audience is comprised of 
different communities with different local standards, 
Sable ultimately bears the burden of complying with 
the prohibition on obscene messages.1  

. . .

. . .The Government may, however, regulate the content 
of constitutionally protected speech in order to 
promote a compelling interest if it chooses the least 
restrictive means to further the articulated interest.  
We have recognized that there is a compelling interest 
in protecting the physical and psychological well-
being of minors.  This interest extends to shielding 
minors from the influence of literature that is not 
obscene by adult standards.  [citations].2  
	The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently held 
that decreased profits and costs of market participation are not 
adequate grounds to support a First Amendment challenge in 
.i.Spokane Arcade, Inc.;, and .i.World Wide Video of Washington, 
Inc., v. City of Spokane;.1  The pornographers argued that the 
city's ordinance, which regulated &quot;adult&quot; arcades (&quot;peep booths&quot; 
for viewing sexually explicit videos), were invalid restrictions 
on the manner in which protected speech may be expressed.  They 
complained that compliance with the ordinance would require 
hiring more employees, thus increasing their payroll expenses 
and decreasing their profits, thereby denying them access to the 
adult entertainment market.  In rejecting this argument, the 
court held:

Even if World Wide Video demonstrated that the hiring 
of additional employees was unavoidable, the adverse 
economic impact it posits is irrelevant to First 
Amendment analysis. . . .

. . .The ordinances do not prohibit World Video from 
engaging in that protected speech which will allow it 
to compete in the adult entertainment market, but 
merely provide that the costs of doing so may 
increase.  This type of 'injury,' however, should not 
inform First Amendment analysis: in Topanga, we 
cautioned against inquiring into the costs of 
continued market participation, and limited the scope 
of permissible economic analysis to an examination of 
whether one is permitted to enter or participate in 
the market in the first instance. . .2

. . . Thus, an absolute bar in this matter would be a 
regulation that prohibited arcade owners from engaging 
in their protected speech, and not one that merely 
prohibited them from realizing the profits to which 
they were accustomed. . . .1
. . . .
.. . . Even if the costs of compliance were so great 
that World Video would be forced out of business, the 
ordinances do not pose any intrinsic limitation on the 
operation of the arcades, but merely increase World 
Video's vulnerability to such market forces as the 
increased costs of labor and the decreased or stagnant 
demand for pornography.  Accordingly we hold that the 
ordinances constitute valid manner restrictions.2
	This Court should reject the &quot;economically infeasible&quot; 
argument by Plaintiffs as irrelevant for First Amendment 
analysis.   
	

.c.VII.	THE CDA IS NOT UNDER INCLUSIVE BECAUSE IT 
PROVIDES FOR PROSECUTION FOR IMPORTING FOREIGN 
COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY AND OF DISTRIBUTORS WHO 
EXPLOIT U.S. CHILDREN.; 
	The United States can and does punish those who bring 
illegal material across its borders through foreign commerce.3  
	In addition to the aforementioned laws, the United States 
is a signatory to .i.Treaty Series, No. 559, Arrangement Between 
The United States And Other Powers Relative To The Repression of 
the Circulation of Obscene Publications;, which was ratified by 
the United States Senate, January 13, 1911 and by the President 
on February 4, 1911.  Ratification of the United States was 
deposited with the Government of the French Republic, March 15, 
1911, and was proclaimed, April 13, 1911.  This .i.treaty is a 
United States law, under Article VI &#167; 2;. of the Constitution &quot;. 
. .and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the 
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the 
land; . . .&quot;  
	The Treaty was cited by the Supreme Court in New York v. 
Ferber and in.i.Roth v. United States;:1   &quot;This rejection [of 
First Amendment protection of obscenity] for *that reason is 
mirrored in the universal judgment that obscenity should be 
restrained, reflected in the international agreement of over 50 
nations, . . . . &quot;2    Although the subject matter of the Treaty 
is obscenity, its existence is significant to demonstrate the 
universal, world wide condemnation of pornography and the 
&quot;resolve&quot; to cooperate in &quot;centralizing all information&quot; and in 
&quot;supplying all information&quot; and in &quot;communicating the laws&quot; by 
the member nation-states to &quot;repress&quot; illegal material.3    


.c.II
								
ARGUMENTS OF AMICUS MORALITY IN MEDIA 
IN SUPPORT OF 
THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT.
								

.c.I.	INDECENT COMMUNICATIONS WHICH, BY MEANS OF 
COMPUTER, INTRUDE INTO THE PRIVACY OF THE HOME AND 
ARE READILY ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN, ARE A FORM OF 
'NUISANCE SPEECH' WHICH CONGRESS CAN PROHIBIT OR 
REGULATE.
	The United States Supreme Court has stated that there are 
narrowly limited classes of speech which are not protected by the First 
Amendment.  One such class is &quot;nuisance speech,&quot; and Amicus Morality 
In Media contends that &quot;indecent&quot; speech which, by means of computer, 
intrudes into the privacy of the home and is easily accessible to children 
is a form of &quot;nuisance speech&quot;1 which Congress can constitutionally 
prohibit or regulate.2
	The concept of &quot;nuisance speech,&quot; as a class of speech unprotected 
by the First Amendment, was first alluded to by the Supreme Court in 
.i.Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire;,3 where the Court stated:

There are certain, well-defined and narrowly limited 
classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which 
have never been thought to raise any Constitutional 
problem.  These include the lewd and obscene...those which 
by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an 
immediate breach of the peace ...[S]uch utterances are no 
essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such 
slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that 
may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the 
social interest in order and morality.1
	The public nuisance rationale was also applied by three Justices 
writing in dissent in .i.Rosenfeld v. New Jersey;2.  Justice Powell, with 
whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun joined, wrote:

But the exception to the First Amendment protection in 
Chaplinsky is not limited to words whose mere utterance 
entails a high probability of an outbreak of physical 
violence.  It also extends to the willful use of scurrilous 
language calculated to offend the sensibilities of an 
unwilling audience. . . . [A] verbal assault on an unwilling 
audience may be so grossly offensive and emotionally 
disturbing as to be the ...subject of criminal proscription, 
whether under a statute denominating it disorderly 
conduct or, more accurately, a public nuisance. . . . The 
Model Penal Code ... also recognizes a distinction between 
utterances which may threaten physical violence and those 
which may amount to a public nuisance, recognizing that 
neither category falls within ... First Amendment 
[protection].1  [Emphasis added].
	In .i.Breard v. Alexandria; 2 and .i.Kovacs v. Cooper;,3 the Court 
upheld nuisance ordinances aimed at means of communication that 
intrude uninvitedly into the privacy of the home.  In .i.Hess v. 
Indiana;,4 the Supreme Court identified  speech that amounts to a 
public nuisance as outside the protection of the First Amendment:

It hardly needs repeating that '[t]he guarantees of freedom 
of speech forbid the States to punish the use of words or 
language not within narrowly limited classes of 
speech'...Hess' words could [not] be punished as 
obscene...could not withstand scrutiny. . . . In addition, 
there is no evidence to indicate that Hess' speech amounted 
to a public nuisance in that privacy interests were being 
invaded.1  [Emphasis added].
	In .i.F.C.C .v. Pacifica Foundation;,2 the Supreme Court
applied the &quot;nuisance speech&quot; rationale to the broadcast media,
affirming an F.C.C. ruling that the monologue, &quot;Filthy Words,&quot;
as broadcast, was indecent and prohibited by .i.18 U.S.C. 1464;.
In so doing, the Court observed that the F.C.C. decision &quot;rested 
entirely on a nuisance 
rationale under which context is all important&quot; and compared indecent 
broadcast to a &quot;pig in a parlor instead of the barnyard.&quot;3  The Court
also stated that 
special regulation of broadcast indecency was justified because it 
&quot;confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the 
home&quot; and because it is &quot;uniquely accessible to children.&quot;4
	In .i.Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser;,5 the Supreme Court 
held that a student could be penalized for making an indecent speech 
before a school assembly, attended by both minor students and adult 
faculty.  Justice Stevens (dissenting on due process grounds) noted:

[A] nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong 
place-like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard. . . . 
Vulgar language, like vulgar animals, may be acceptable in 
some contexts, and intolerable in others. . . . It 
seems...obvious that [the] speech would be inappropriate in 
certain...settings.1
	Amicus Morality in Media contends that indecency which, by 
means of computer, intrudes into the privacy of the home and is readily 
accessible to children and also amounts to a &quot;nuisance&quot; and is 
unprotected by the First Amendment.2

	
.c.II.	APPLYING INDECENCY STANDARD TO THE INTERNET 
WILL NOT REDUCE ADULTS TO VIEWING ONLY WHAT IS FIT 
FOR CHILDREN.
	Amicus Morality in Media contends that there are many 
circumstances in &quot;cyberspace&quot; where adults in the privacy of their 
homes can be exposed unwillingly to patently offensive, indecent 
material transmitted by means of computers 3 and that while 
protecting children was Congress' immediate concern in enacting the 
Communications Decency Act, it utilized a legal standard that protects 
not just children but also adults.
	The &quot;Indecency&quot; standard is determined by what offends 
community standards, not by what is &quot;harmful to minors.&quot;1  In .i.Roth v. 
United States;,2 the Supreme Court stated:  &quot;This Court, as early as 1896, 
said of the Federal Obscenity Statute: '...Every one who uses the 
mails...must take notice of what...is meant by decency...in social life.'&quot;  
[Emphasis added].
	In .i.Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day;,3 Justice Harlan stated that 
indecency (viz. &quot;patent offensiveness&quot;) involves application of 
community standards:  &quot;The words...'obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, 
filthy or vile,' connote something that is portrayed in a manner so 
offensive as to make it unacceptable under current community 
mores...[T]he statute reaches only indecent material. . . .&quot;
	In .i.F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation;, the Supreme Court stated that 
the &quot;normal definition of 'indecent' merely refers to non conformance 
with accepted standards of morality.'&quot;4  In .i.Bethel School District No. 
403 v. Fraser;,1 the Supreme Court noted that members of Congress 
were prohibited from using &quot;indecent language&quot; against the proceedings 
of the House,&quot; and also stated:  &quot;[S]chools must teach by example the 
shared values of a civilized social order. . . . The pervasive sexual 
innuendo in [the student's speech was plainly offensive to...teachers and 
students-indeed to any mature person.&quot;2  [Emphasis added].
	In .i.Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.;,3 the Supreme Court upheld an 
Indiana statute prohibiting &quot;Public indecency.&quot;  In so doing, Chief Justice 
Rehnquist noted:  &quot;Public indecency statutes of this sort...reflect the 
moral disapproval of people appearing the nude among strangers in 
public places. . . . Thus the public indecency statute furthers a 
substantial government interest in protecting order and morality.&quot;4
	Nor has the Supreme Court said that Congress may only regulate 
indecency to protect children.  In .i.Pacifica;, the Supreme Court held 
that government could restrict indecent broadcast material to protect 
&quot;all Americans&quot; in the privacy of their homes:

[T]he broadcast media have established a uniquely 
pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans.  Patently 
offensive, indecent material presented over the airwaves 
confronts the citizen...in the privacy of the home, where the 
individual's right to be left alone plainly outweighs the 
First Amendment rights of an intruder...[P]rior warnings 
cannot completely protect the listener or viewer from 
unexpected program content.1  [Emphasis added].
	In .i.Frisby v. Schultz;,2 the Supreme Court described the &quot;interest&quot; 
in protecting the well-being, tranquillity, and privacy of the home as 
being &quot;certainly of the highest order in a free and civilized society.&quot;  The 
Court then stated:

One important aspect of residential privacy is protection of 
the unwilling listener.  Although in many locations we 
expect individuals simply to avoid speech..., the home is 
different. . . . Thus, we have repeatedly held that 
individuals are not required to welcome unwanted speech 
into their own homes and that government may protect 
this freedom.  See, e.g., F.C.C. v. Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726, 748-
749 (1978)...Id., at 750, 760 (Powell, J. concurring in part 
and concurring in judgment).3
	In .i.Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. F.C.C.;,4 the issue 
was whether a TOTAL BAN on indecent dial-a-porn messages could be 
justified.  The Court said &quot;No&quot; but also stated that unlike the broadcast 
medium, adults in the privacy of their homes were not likely to be 
exposed, by means of telephone, to indecent communications 
unwillingly.5
	Clearly, the C.D.A., which restricts but does not prohibit the 
display of depictions or descriptions of sexual or excretory activities or 
organs, which are portrayed in a manner so offensive as to make them 
unacceptable under current community mores, does not reduce the 
adult population to viewing only what is fit for children.1  It does 
reflect a judgment that the ease with which children may obtain access 
to such material by means of computer, &quot;coupled with the concerns 
recognized in .i.Ginsberg;,&quot;2 amply justify the C.D.A.'s minimal restriction 
on adult access to indecent communications.

.c.III.	THE 'INDECENCY' STANDARD IS NEITHER VAGUE NOR 
OVERBROAD.
	Plaintiffs argue that the definition of &quot;indecent&quot; is vague and 
overbroad.  In .i.Pacifica;, however, the Supreme Court rejected a very 
similar challenge:

[Pacifica] argues that the Commission's construction of the 
statutory language broadly encompasses so much 
constitutionally protected speech that reversal is required. . 
. . At most, however, the Commission's definition of 
indecency will deter only the broadcasting of patently 
offensive references to excretory and sexual organs and 
activities.  While some of these references may be 
protected, they surely lie at the periphery of First 
Amendment concern. . . . The danger dismissed so 
summarily in Red Lion...was that broadcasters would 
respond to the vagueness of the regulations by refusing to 
present programs dealing with important social and 
political controversies.  Invalidating any rule on the basis 
of hypothetical application to situations not before the 
Court is 'strong medicine' to be applied 'sparingly and only 
as a last resort.'1
	Vagueness challenges to the term &quot;indecent,&quot; as defined by the 
F.C.C. for the telephone medium were also rejected by the Second Circuit 
in .i.Dial Information Services Corp. of New York v. Barr;2 and by the 
Ninth Circuit in .i.Information Providers' Coalition v. F.C.C.;3
	In .i.Miller v. California;,4 the Supreme Court also pointed to the 
&quot;patently offensive sexual conduct&quot; prong of its obscenity test as 
providing &quot;fair notice&quot; to those who traffic in sex materials.5  This prong 
of the .i.Miller; test is very similar to the F.C.C.'s &quot;indecency definition, 
and Amicus Moralilty in Media would contend that what provides 
adequate notice for a prohibition on obscene speech also provides 
adequate notice for a restriction on indecent speech.
	Amicus also contend that the &quot;nuisance rationale,&quot; combined with 
the requirement that the depiction or description of sexual or excretory 
activities be &quot;patently offensive&quot; when applying &quot;community standards,&quot; 
obviate petitioners concern about &quot;overbreadth.&quot;
	The test of whether a depiction or description of sexual or 
excretory activities is &quot;indecent&quot; is not whether some people in the 
community are offended1 or even whether almost everyone is 
&quot;offended.&quot;2  The test is whether, when applying &quot;community 
standards,&quot; such depictions or descriptions are &quot;patently offensive,&quot; and 
Amicus would contend that the term &quot;patently offensive&quot; has a well-
defined meaning in the law.3
	In addition, the &quot;nuisance&quot; concept &quot;requires consideration of a 
host of variables.&quot;1  In .i.Pacifica;, the &quot;time of day&quot;2 was emphasized.  
&quot;Serious value,&quot;1 is another key variable to be considered in 
determining whether content is &quot;indecent.&quot;  &quot;Place&quot;, whether in the 
physical realm or in &quot;cyberspace&quot;, is also a key variable in determining 
whether something is a nuisance.  As noted in .i.Pacifica;, a &quot;nuisance 
may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, like a pig in the parlor 
instead of the barnyard.&quot;2
	What may be acceptable in a part of &quot;cyberspace&quot; devoted to the 
discussion of health or human rights issues, or as part of a database on 
&quot;gay rights&quot;, may not be acceptable if displayed in other areas of the 
Internet or World Wide Web, particularly if viewers would likely be 
surprised and offended by the display.3  In &quot;cyberspace&quot;, as in other 
media, whether sexually explicit materials are indecent will often also 
depend, in part, on whether the materials &quot;appeal to the prurient 
interest&quot; or are pandered for that appeal.4
	There is an extensive history of court and F.C.C. rulings to guide 
program providers in determining what is &quot;patently offensive&quot;5 and 
&quot;indecent.&quot;1  Amicus Morality in Media would contend that the real 
problem is not that the &quot;indecency&quot; concept is vague or overbroad, but 
rather a failure to recognize that there are &quot;rights and interests, 'other 
than those of the advocates involved'&quot;2-which include the &quot;right of the 
Nation...to maintain a decent society&quot;3 and the compelling interest in 
protecting children from patently offensive, indecent material.

.c..c.Conclusion
	The CDA is narrowly tailored to serve the compelling 
interest in protecting children from accessing computer 
pornography.  It is the least restrictive, yet effective, means 
of accomplishing this interest and addresses a problem of 
immediate importance.
	This Court must decide whether to strike down the law's 
protection for children in the next great communication 
technology.  America has never had a mass communications medium 
that openly displayed indecent pornography in public. This Court 
should not let the Plaintiffs start one now.  	Criminal 
laws against distributing pornography to children have literally 
saved countless lives.  These laws are needed not for any threat 
posed by men of good will, but rather by those who would exploit 
the vulnerable and impressionable for their personal gain.  
	The Communications Decency Act is a narrowly drawn work of 
art.  It is sensitive to the First Amendment and the rights of 
children.  This Court should not accept the arguments of 
Plaintiffs and should declare the CDA valid.  
	Senators Exon and Coats deserve thanks from every family in 
America and the CDA deserves to be upheld.

1	As the rapid &quot;development&quot; of the PICS platform and proposed 
&quot;rating&quot; system to go with it were developed in the past one year as a 
way to forestall the obligations of the CDA to place responsibility only 
on those who would knowingly provide or expose minors to patently 
offensive indecency.

2	Imagine what would have happened if television and radio had 
not had the benefit of indecency regulations -- part of the success of 
these mediums was their universal accesibility.  The CDA would also 
help to make the Internet universally acceptable and accepted, and 
thereby beneficial and profitable for everyone.

1	In fact, the form letters used by the FCC state either that &quot;Material 
will not be found to be indecent by virtue of subject matter alone.&quot; or 
&quot;Subject matter alone does not render material indecent.&quot; and discuss 
the Commission's consideration of serious value and purpose and of 
pandering to prurient interest in judging &quot;patent offensiveness&quot; in 
context and under the particular circumstances, as do the opinions and 
orders finding the presence of indecency.

1	The Court in Hamling, at 123, noted a like scienter requirement 
for state &quot;harmful to minors&quot; laws, as announced in Ginsberg v. New 
York, 390 U.S. 629, 643-45 (1968).  The Court would apply a similar 
rule for child pornography cases, hold that scienter is required both as 
to the sexual character and minority of the performer, but not define 
the precise limits of such a requirement other than to refer to the 
obscenity/harmful to minors cases on scienter discussed above. See

Pacifica that the free play of market forces will discourage indecent

literature and films would appear to justify skepticism.&quot;

1	Amici commend the good faith efforts of most of the screening 
software developers (such as SurfWatch, Rated PG, Net Nanny, Cyber 
Patrol, Cybersitter, etc.) and recommend to parents that they should 
obtain and intitute whatever parental control and electronic restrictions 
are currently available to protect their children as best they can from 
the extreme types of hard-core and soft-core pornography now on the 
Internet.  These hunt and block screening indexes are less than perfect, 
as testimony before this Court demonstrated.  (Reviewers have found 
glitches in the armor, as well, finding that filename based Cybersitter 
won't catch cryptic titles, word based Net Nanny won't get porn images, 
and SurfWatch doesn't work non-Internet sources, such as BBSs. PC 
Magazine, Nov. 7, 1995.)  Parents can only hope and trust that present 
and future versions are better, since the stakes are high when the 
defenses fail.   As the conviction of the bestiality, torture, excretory, and 
child exploitation pictures from the Amateur Action BBS illustrate, the 
problem is severe no matter how small a percentage of the total 
information available on the Net.  See U.S. v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701 (6th 
Cir. 1996).  Though commercial pornographers like Thomas can and may 
comply with the adult access requirements of the CDA as for indecency, 
the hard-core nature of the pornography makes them liable for 
obscenity violations nonetheless.  In addition, customers can and do 
purchase such pornography from commercial BBS sources and post 
them for free on WWW sites, Usenet news groups (&quot;alt.sex...&quot;).  These 
&quot;porn pirate&quot; customers have polluted cyberspace with the toxic 
pornography (both obscene and indecent, and equally and instantly 
available to children) that the CDA seeks to control.

1	See  Paris, supra, at 57 n. 7 (&quot;The legitimate interest in preventing 
exposure of juveniles to obscene materials cannot be fully served by 
simply barring juveniles from the immediate physical premises of 
'adult' bookstores, when there is a flourishing 'outside business' in these 
materials.&quot;)

1  	Dr. Dan R. Olsen, Jr. states in his Declaration: 

In summary, identifying sexually explicit material is a 
human judgment that is not fully automatable using any 
known technology.  The process of evaluating sites and 
producing lists of inappropriate sites is a huge task that is 
already ineffective in its current efforts and will become 
increasingly more difficult as the Internet grows.  The only 
economically viable mechanism for evaluating Internet 
content is for content providers to assume the responsibility.  
Technologically, if the number of inappropriate sites 
continues to escalate the burden on users to store lists of 
blocked sites can become large.  There is no known 
mechanism for automatically screening Internet content. 

Declaration of Dr. Dan R. Olsen, Jr. pp. 38-44 (April 9, 1996).  According 
to Howard A. Schmidt:

[U]ser-based controls, while commendable, will inevitably be 
trying to keep up with the addition of new and revised sites, 
and in the long term may face attacks from those who may 
distribute information on how to disable the program.

Declaration of Howard A. Schmidt, pp. 39-46 (April 9, 1996).

1	The ineffectiveness of this bald assertion is obvious 
and is supported as well by the following facts and the 
opinions of Defendant's expert witnesses:  1) Not all 
parents can or will avail themselves of &quot;blocking&quot; software 
and filtering and screening devices.  2) Children have 
access to many computers which will not employ software and 
filtering devices. 3) Children are capable of out-
maneuvering such technology. 4) Pornographers are capable 
of out-maneuvering such devices.

According to Howard A. Schmidt:

[M]any parents do not have the same level of 
sophistication with computers as many minors do today 
-- nor the time to supervise their children's use of 
computers online.  For this reason, in my opinion, 
relying on parental controls and supervision will only 
be a part of the solution to restricting access by 
minors to material that is inappropriate for them.

Declaration of Howard A. Schmidt, pp. 39-46 (April 9, 
1996). 

1	Ann Duvall, President of Surfwatch, Inc., testifies for plaintiffs on 
Mar 21, 1996 that Surfwatch finds &quot;between a hundred and 200 
[sexually explicit] sites a week&quot; that are new and not blocked by 
Surfwatch.  See PI/TRO Hearing, transcript p. 145 (March 21, 1996). 
&quot;These programs are not foolproof.  New online sites are created daily 
and no software can guarantee that it will block access to every site that 
discusses sex or uses 'vulgar' words.&quot; See Plaintiff ACLU Brief In 
Support of a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary 
Injunction, p. 24.

1  These amici submit that this is more so than with obscenity due to 
the nature of hard-core pornography as a traditionally closeted, 
shameful, and morbid fetish associated with voyeurs and &quot;dirty old 
men&quot; outside the mainstream of normal adult society.  Notwithstanding 
some hard-core videos now available to the general public at video 
stores, rather than exclusively at &quot;adult&quot; porn shops and theatres, 
obscenity as a legal concept is not as easily recognized or understand by 
the average citizen or businessperson.

1  The indecency standard, thus applied, may apply to less speech than 
would the &quot;harmful to minors&quot; test, which considers each prong -- 
prurience, offensiveness, and value -- in relation to minors only, rather 
than as a general judgment.  As the FCC interprets the indecency 
standard and the mandate of Pacifica, pandering pornographically for 
prurient appeal and serious value or lack of it are essential components 
of a judgment that a description or depiction of a sexual or excretory act 
or organ is &quot;patently offensive&quot;.  For many examples of this contextual 
judgment, see the liability and dismissal opinions of the FCC that are 
included in Appendix 8. In this regard, indecency can be more 
protective of a broader range of speech than a state &quot;harmful to minors&quot; 
display or sale statute.  The &quot;harmful to minors&quot; test may vary even as 
to age groups of minors, as in Commonwealth v. American Booksellers 
Ass'n., 372 S.E.2d 618 (VA. 1988)(on certified questions from the 
Supreme Court), and American Booksellers Ass'n. v. Com. of Va., 882 
F.2d 125 (4th Cir. 1989)(upholding Virginia's harmful to minors display 
law, on remand from the Supreme Court, in light of the Supreme Court 
of Virginia's opinion), and this rule of context could be equally 
applicable to the application of indecency on the Internet as mandated 
in Pacifica, supra, at 750 (&quot;content of the program ...will also affect the 
composition of the audience&quot;). See Actions for Children's Television v. 
FCC, 11 F.3d 170, 178-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (&quot;ACT III&quot;)

1  It cannot be said that there are few children online.  

1  One main factor given in Pacifica, at 750, is equally applicable to the 
Internet and will be increasingly relevant as plaintiffs and the rest of 
the industry succeed at getting more families and children online: &quot;The 
ease with which children may obtain access to broadcast material, 
coupled with the concerns recognized in Ginsberg, amply justify special 
treatment of indecent broadcasting.&quot;

these sites may have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific 
value, and therefore, would not be patently offensive in their depictions 
or description of sexual or excretory organs or functions under 
contemporary community standards for the interactive computer 
medium.  As such, it would be legal to allow minors access to the 
material offered and the good faith defenses of &#167; 223 would be 
unnecessary.

material, while not specifically mentioning nuisance speech, twice cites 
the book, Free Speech in the United States, by Zechariah Chafee, Jr. 
(1941), which does so at pp. 149, 150:

But the law also punishes a few classes of words 
like obscenity, profanity ...because the very 
utterance of such words is considered to inflict a 
present injury upon listeners, readers. . . . This is 
a very different matter from punishing words 
because they express ideas thought to cause 
future danger to the state. . . . [P]roperly limited 
they fall outside the protection of the free 
speech clauses. . . . [P]rofanity, indecent talk and 
pictures, which do not form an essential part of 
any exposition of ideas, have a very slight social 
value as a step toward truth, which is clearly 
outweighed by the social interests in order, 
morality, the training of the young and the peace 
of mind of those who hear or see. . . . The man 
who swears in a street car is as much of a 
nuisance as the man who smokes there.

2  If Amicus is correct that &quot;nuisance speech&quot; is unprotected, then &quot;strict 
scrutiny&quot; is not the level of scrutiny to be applied.  Cf., City of Dallas v. 
Stanglin, 109 S. Ct. 159, 57 LW 4406, 4407 (1989):  &quot;Unless laws 'create 
suspect classifications or impinge upon constitutionally protected 
rights,'...it need only be shown that they bear 'some rationale 
relationship to a legitimate state purpose.'&quot;

3  Cf., op ed article, The Internet's Private Side, N.Y. TIMES, March 2, 
1996, wherein author David S. Bannahum, publisher of MEME, an online 
newsletter, states:

During a jaunt through the World Wide Web, I 
came across a seemingly innocuous invitation, 
'This is a HOT link.'  I clicked on the glowing 
words which connected me with another 
computer that generated a picture of a nude 
woman with the tag line, 'Slut for Rent.'... This 
phone-sex service advertising its wares, just an 
accidental mouse click away, shows how easily 
browsers can stumble across pornography on 
computer networks.  [Emphasis supplied by 
Amicus].

5  492 U.S. 115, at 127-128 (1989).  Amicus notes that the Federal Dial-
a-Porn law 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223 (b) now prohibits making, by means of 
telephone, any indecent communication for commercial purposes both 
to minors AND to &quot;any other person without that person's consent.&quot;  
Like the dial-a-porn medium, adults, usually are &quot;forewarned&quot; about 
indecent content in &quot;cyberspace.&quot;  There are circumstances, however, 
where they are unwilling viewers.  In such circumstances, Amicus 
would contend that the Pacifica nuisance rationale controls.

1  While some Federal judicial districts may be more conservative than 
others, every district contains both &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;conservatives,&quot; 
religious and non religious citizens.  Even among devoutly religious 
Americans, there are differences as to what is deemed &quot;indecent.&quot;  The 
test is not what the most sensitive individuals and groups find 
acceptable, but what the community as a whole finds acceptable.

2  As noted in the Supreme Court's &quot;Seven Dirty Words Case&quot; (F.C.C. v. 
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. at 745-748):

[T]he fact that society may find speech offensive 
is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it.  
Indeed, if it is the speaker's opinion that gives 
offense, that...is a reason for according it 
constitutional protection. . . . But...[t]hese words 
offend for the same reasons that obscenity 
offends. . . . [S]uch utterances are no essential 
part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such 
slight social value as a step to truth that any 
benefit derived from them is clearly outweighed 
by the social interest in order and morality.  
[Emphasis added].

3  See, e.g., United States v. Ginzburg, 338 F.2d 12, at 14 (3rd Cir. 1964), 
aff'd. 383 U.S. 463 (1966).  The origin in case law and meaning of 
&quot;patent offensiveness&quot; are annotated and described in Volume 1, 
&#182;7000-&quot;Patent Offensiveness,&quot; the  Obscenity Law Reporter (National 
Obscenity Law Center, 1986), at pp. 7002-42, and is summarized at 
7002-03 as follows:

In Manual Enterprises v. Day, 370 U.S. 478 
(1962), Justices Harlan and Stewart, in a 
plurality opinion, added a new element to 
the...test for obscenity by requiring that the 
material...also be &quot;patently offensive&quot; before it 
can be labeled &quot;obscene.&quot;  They stated, &quot;These 
magazines cannot be deemed so offensive on 
their face as to affront current community 
standards of decency-a quality that we shall 
hereafter refer to as 'patent offensiveness' or 
'indecency.'  The two Justices also noted that the 
American Law Institute's draft of a Model Penal 
Code took the position that...for a thing to be 
obscene, it must go substantially beyond the 
limits of candor in description or representation 
of such matters. . . . Justices Harlan and Stewart 
indicated that...obscenity connotes something 
that is portrayed in a manner so offensive as to 
make it &quot;unacceptable under community mores.&quot; 
and is aimed at &quot;obnoxiously debasing portrayals 
of sex.&quot;  [Emphasis supplied by Amicus]. . . . It is 
also to be observed that the Supreme Court in 
Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 105 [at 112] 
(1974) treated Manual Enterprises as an 
authoritative binding precedent....

2  Id. at 750.  While not all indecent communications in &quot;cyberspace&quot; 
can be &quot;time channeled&quot;, many such communications can be displayed 
only after 10 p.m. or midnight.

F.C.C., 852 F.2d 1332, at 1339-1340 (D.C. Cir. 1988).

128 (1989).

4  In F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, the Supreme Court held that while 
&quot;prurient appeal&quot; is an element of the obscene, it is not an &quot;essential 
component of indecent language.&quot;  Id. at 438 U.S. at 741.  As noted in 
Manual Enterprises v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, at 486 (1961).  However, the 
two elements tend to coalesce, for that which is patently offensive will 
also usually carry the requisite 'prurient interest' appeal.&quot;
