ELECTRONICS

Look for a Slowdown
in the Coming Year

According to the Semiconductor Industry Assn.s preliminary
numbers, the worldwide semiconductor device markets grew an
unprecedented 43.7% to well over $145 billion in 1995, after
predicting a growth rate of less than 15%.  The question of whether
market growth of this magnitude can be sustained at the 1995 level
or not remains.  In short, our reply is, no.  A look at the
markets driving forces in 1995 will fill in the blanks.

First, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices accounted for
nearly 30% of the total market, up from 17% as recently as 1993.
The major factor this past year, of course, was the release of
Windows 95 PC operating (OS) system, and its requirement of up to
16 megabytes of RAM for smooth operation.  Since 1993, the influx
of graphics-intensive software had pushed memory requirements to
the 8 megabyte range, where it remains for applications of this
type.  No new wunderkind software applications or OSs are on the
horizon to push RAM requirements up further.  Look for a leveling
of DRAM demand in particular to soften the market somewhat.

This is not to say the market will not experience healthy growth.
While the PC market, still the main silicon device driver, may have
matured in North America, other areas in the world are seeing PC
sales growth in the 20% per year range.  However, hardware
requirements have stabilized for the time being.  We see the
semiconductor market approaching $180 billion in 1996, which is an
increase of just over 23%.  Major beneficiaries of the overall
market are manufacturing equipment suppliers, who will ride for
free in 1996, with many companies reporting up to nine-month
backlogs in orders.

A market for which we see little potential is that for cheap, dumb
PC terminals under development for World Wide Web access.  Under
the concept, these machines would lack the standard hard drive,
floppy disks, and extensive software systems, but would still
require RAM and processor power.

Anyone who has cruised the Web will tell you that moving from site-
to-site is a tedious process, and speed is of the essence.  In
addition, online time is money, and for any system designed to
cruise the Web to be successful, it must provide the processing
power and memory needed to smoothly handle the graphics-intensive
Web.  At current prices, a powerful, 8 megabyte machine cannot be
built and sold with the hoped-for price tag of $500.  A system
built for more than that price will collect dust on warehouse
shelves (right alongside PDAs)!

INTSTRUMENTS

The Analytical Industry
Sharpens Its Focus

For instrument makers, 1995 was a year of recovery from poor
performance during 1993 and part of 1994.  A number of categories
have improved appreciably due to increased demand in segments of
industrial process applications and biomedical research.
Environmental applications are flat to shrinking, so a number of
suppliers are developing new strategies to reach other markets.

Instrument makers continue to find more ways to improve their
manufacturing methods by reducing the number of parts, simplifying
assembly steps and implementing more stringent testing of key
components.  The net result, in some cases, is a product that is
more reliable, and features more capabilities, while actually
costing less.

More importantly though, for future sales, a growing range of
sophisticated technologies are being adapted to various
instrumentation.  New detectors, more powerful computers, improved
methods of analysis, new reagents and other factors are pushing
many instruments to new levels of performance.  Also, other types
of hybrid instrumentation are finding new market niches and are
helping to expand the suppliers product lines.

Examples of new types of instrumentations that may find significant
markets in the future are the Smart Nose instruments, field-flow
fractionation (FFF),  and newly configured ion mobility
spectrometers.  Also, some product segments that were thought to be
technologically mature are showing surprising new innovations that
are reinvigorating those instrument segments.

BCC report G-181 The New Generation of Analytical Instruments, is
an upcoming report that surveys the 1995 analytical instrument
market, as well as international markets and projects units and
sales through 2005 for over 30 instruments.

The BCC estimate of the 1995 U.S. market for analytical
instruments, as defined by the Dept. of Commerce, was approximately
$5.1-$5.8 billion in shipments.  Related measuring instruments
would bring the figure closer to $6.5-$7.5 billion .  Projected
U.S. sales growth is projected to be approximately 5-7% through
2005.

It  is worth noting that of those shipments, $1.2-1.4 billion was
just in parts, components and accessories.  While the overall
market appears to have grown in the U.S. , the parts segment has
stayed flat.  For 1995, pending further data, the estimated value
of exports of analytical instruments from the U.S. was an estimated
$1.90-$2.1 billion, and imports were an estimated $1.2-$1.3
billion.

SEPARATIONS

Advances Point to
Steady Growth

The various ways of separating materials from mixtures are a
critical but little known part of industrial production.  From
pharmaceuticals to food and even waste treatment, producers rely on
these rapidly developing technologies. These techniques are also
key to research and analysis.

Lately, we are seeing increased interest in magnetic separations,
both on the research front and by commercial concerns.  Developing
technologies will advance this high tech market. Los Alamos
National Lab (Los Alamos, NM 87545) researchers are using high-
gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) to extract slightly magnetic
radioactive contaminants from soil or water.  The process primary
advantage is the lack of secondary waste produced.

In the pharmaceutical industry, PerSeptive Diagnostics (500 Old
Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA 10701; Tel: 617/499-1433) have
simplified the process of isolating GAC repeats using BioMag
Streptavidin and magnetic agarose.  While scientists report the use
of magnetic particles specifically for the isolation of CAG
repeats, in principle, the same techniques could be used to isolate
any gene for which a biotinylated PNA probe could be synthesized.


Diagnostic test maker, Ohmicron Environmental Diagnostics Inc. (375
Pheasant Run, Newtown, PA 18940; Tel: 800/544-8881), has
commercialized two new magnetic particle-based RaPID Assay
immunoassay test kits-cyclodienes and metribuzin.

Older processes have also advanced. Researchers continue to test
the boundary of capillary electrophoresis (CE) applications.
Recently, considerable attention has been focused on a highly
promising technique for metal ion analysis.  Andrei Timerbaev has
been developing a number of migration models based on a generally
valid equation for electrophoretic mobility as a function of charge
density.  Two major obstacles affecting CE are electroendosmotic
flow (EOF) and sample adsorption onto the capillary wall.

Researchers at the University of Uppsala (Dept. of Biochemistry,
Uppsala, Sweden) have developed a method of coating the capillaries
that eliminates both problems for a considerable length of time.
Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton, CA 92634; Tel:
800/742-2345)  Chia-Hui Shieh has recently patented coated
capillary columns and a method for their use.

Supercritical fluids technology has also expanded its applications
horizons.  Two separate studies recently compared supercritical
fluid extraction (SFE) with liquid extraction as methods for
removing labile vitamins from creams, lotions, and tablets.  As a
result of their work, the researchers recommended SFE as a method
for quality-control analysis of pharmaceutical tablets.

Supercritical carbon dioxide is now being used as a method to
recover uranium and plutonium from nuclear wastes and spent fuels.
And Los Alamos National Lab (Chemical Science and Technology Div.,
Los Alamos, NM 87545) has used supercritical CO2 as a method of
precision cleaning that reduces hazardous waste.  The primary
advantage of this technique is the elimination of chlorocarbons and
chlorofluorocarbons as solvents.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Watch the Fiber
Optic Market

Market growth for fiber optic materials will increase at a rapid
pace, but not as fast in some segments as many industry sources
predicted a few years ago, says a new BCC business opportunity
report, Fiber Optic Materials.  The predicted market surge for
fiber optic materials in interexchange, or long distance carrier
applications and in networks involving a single building or a group
of buildings continues unabated.  On the other hand, the
uncertainly now creeping into the market revolves around the speed
with which the local exchange carriers (LECs) will upgrade their
residential networks.

Fiber optic materials represent much of the physical structure
needed for existing telecommunications systems, as well as for the
vast networks envisioned for installation during the remainder of
this decade and the 21st century. Telecommunications systems
capable of providing voice, data, text, and video to a variety of
users will require large increases in the ability to transmit an
enormous number of signals over both long and short distances.
Technical advances in erbium-doped amplifiers, plastic optical
fiber (POF), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technologies, to
name only a few, are spurring the deployment of fiber optic
networks.

Two segments of the fiber optic material market, fiber from local
exchanges to the curb and fiber from the curb to the home, were the
subject of very (some would say wildly) optimistic growth estimates
as recently as 1994.  Now many industry sources believe that for
the next 5-10 years, in most cases, fiber optic service will end at
the neighborhood level.

There are several regions for the new uncertainty in these market
segments.  First, the expected merging of and blurring of the
distinct lines between regional telephone companies and cable
television operators is not occurring nearly as fast as previously
predicted.  Second, although legislation opening up competition in
local communications markets is certain, the pace of its
implementation may be slower than previously thought.  Finally,
despite huge drops in the cost of fiber optic network components,
the rush to replace copper and coaxial cable in these applications
has been slower than forecast.

The BCC Fiber Optic Materials report presents a detailed view of
world market size, growth, and trends for this industry.  The major
product lines and applications are identified, and the market size
for each product line and application is estimated for the next
five years.  Significant global technological trends and
developments in materials and applications are identified and
analyzed, and the structure of the industry is addressed.  Profiles
of the major fiber optic materials suppliers are provided.

This BCC report provides in-depth information and technological
evaluations for decision making by those involved in the supply of
fiber optic materials to the telecommunications industry.  This
study can assist users in strategic planning, acquisition analysis,
technology analysis, commercial development of new products, and
analysis of competitors strategies, strengths, weaknesses,
pricing, market share, and profitability.

MEMBRANES

A Technology That
Is Coming of Age

1996 is expected to see membrane based technologies increasingly
incorporated into large scale industrial processes.  Progress is
expected to continue in an evolutionary mode with newer membranes
and devices overcoming earlier shortcomings such as flux, fouling,
and scalability. Some of the new concepts up for trial during the
year might include contained liquid membranes, membrane based
stripping, extraction and adsorption. Hybrid process will bring in
membrane separations to augment what cannot be attained
economically by either process on a stand alone basis.

Ultrafiltration (UF) is up for a greater variety of materials to
help out the reliable polysulfone. Zirconia on alumina or some
other type of inorganic may find wider acceptance. PVDF and
modified PANs can find their niche. Crossflow operational modes for
UF and MF (microfiltration) will increasingly be the norm.

Pervaporation (PV) will continue its commercial acceptance, but it
is a hard sell.  Potential users do not know what this versatile
money maker can really do for them. Removal of organics from water
via hydrophobic silicone membranes on a microporous substrate in
the spiral wound configuration is being commercialized.  Hollow
fiber units with transverse feed flow have been developed. Yet to
be commercialized is the Exxon process to separate
aromatics/saturates in the same boiling range into an aromatics-
lean retentate for diesel and an aromatics-rich permeate for high
octane gasoline using a polyimide/polyadipate copolymer membrane.

Membrane processes that remove VOCs from air or nitrogen should be
better accepted.  Cation exchange membranes for continuous
deionization should find wider use in deionized water production.
Condensation has been integrated with vapor permeation for VOC
removal and additional hybrids such as cryo-membrane permeation,
membrane-PSA, and cryogenic-membrane-PSA have been patented. A
relatively new commercial development is the membrane phase
contactor for use in extraction, absorption, and stripping. An
example of the absorption application of the membrane phase
contactor is used in the beverage industry to add carbon dioxide to
aqueous solutions for carbonation.

Non-separating functions of membranes are expected to advance in
total usage.  Artificial skin, controlled release applications,
biomemitic devices, and breathable fabrics are all examples. Bag
filters still dominate the particulate/air entrapment market, but
low cost membranes could take market share.  An entire market area
could open up if a really low cost membrane material for disposable
diapers could be produced.

separations industry. She is managing director of Membrane &

PLASTICS

Market Turns to
the Pacific Rim

The plastics industry has been able to absorb some overcapacity
because of increased demand.  However, the spectre of overcapacity
still plagues the industry for many commodity resins because of
rapid expansion in capacities in Pacific Rim countries.
Continuance of this scenario will result in lower prices, and
operating rates along with reduced profits.

Opportunities for plastics consumption are strong in Asia, Africa,
and the Mideast, with Eastern Europe still lagging behind the
global pace.  However, only the Asian market is of significant
volume.

Main driving forces for plastics consumption still reside with
traditional markets led by automotive, consumer products, and
electrical/electronic. In addition to new polymerization advances
characterized by metallocene technologies, other aspects still
being pursued include alloying/blending, and use of reinforcements
to enhance existing properties.

Metallocene-based resins have expanded from polyethylene to
polypropylene with polystyrene versions expected in a year or two.
The high cost of producing metallocene resins will probably be
minimized by converting existing reactors (retrofitting).  In
addition, it is expected that metallocene catalysts will be used in
conjunction with traditional catalysts combining advantages of
both.

Foamed resins have been at the center of the environmental scene
with replacements of CFCs by HCFCs as blowing agents.  The
worldwide agreement to ban CFCs (Montreal Protocol) has been moved
up to the year 2000.  Recycled plastic markets are still dominated
by PET bottles and HDPE.  Packaging will remain the largest market
for recycled resins for the next few years.

BIOTECHNOLOGY

Still Survival
of the Fittest

Seeing into the future can be a bit tricky.  We're reminded of the
Coney Island fortune teller who predicted we'd soon take a journey
over water.  The next day it rained and in the course of our
peregrinations we stepped over a puddle, fulfilling the prophecy.


Predicting this year's unfolding of biotechnology events is
something like that Coney Island experience: if they're general
enough, predictions surely will come to pass, like saying some
biotechnology companies in 1996 will probably succeed while others
will probably have to pack it in. Some products in clinical trials
will pass, while others will fail.

But which ones?  If that could be known ahead of time, one could
make a fortune.  Some people of course believe that test tube
experiments and preclinical studies with animal models can foretell
the future, can tell how the candidate drugs will behave in humans.
And a lot of bets are placed on such forecasts.

One of the big events of the year just past is the recognition that
some biotechnology efforts may fail, just as surely as some will
succeed. We may not know precisely which category any particular
venture may fall into, but just the mere recognition that failure
may occur represents a far cry from biotechnology's earlier, heady
days of overconfidence. Building in plans for the unexpected
"impossibilities" provides companies with mechanisms in place to
let them cope with uncertainty, and survive.

Forecasting is not all speculation, of course, although it can be
wishful thinking.  If a product passes its trials, and if it
receives regulatory approval, and if  it captures an assumed
percentage share of its available market, then a reasonable
forecast of its possible sales can be made and the manufacturing
capacity to fulfill that demand can be rationally planned.  The
"trick" lies in being as objective (at least with oneself) in
making business forecasts as in designing laboratory experiments.

Some forecasting is done by extrapolating from the past and
present, in light of unfolding forces for change. On this basis,
predicting biotechnology events in 1996 is made a little easier by
considering several discernible trends.

    Virtualization of the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate.
Big pharma surrounds itself with drug discovery firms to fulfill
its research needs, while biotechnology companies surround
themselves with contract manufacturers. It's cheaper and less
committal than hiring in these functions. Marketing may become the
next function to be outsourced.

    Differentiation of the biotechnology industry will become more
transparent. Companies divide into those seeking to commercialize
biomolecules and those seeking to commercialize chemical molecules
acting on biological targets. They also divide into discoverers of
candidate targets for therapeutic intervention and developers of
actual drug candidates.

    The struggle to survive will become more intense. Not only is
it getting harder to raise money to sustain research, in view of
coming cuts in the federal budget, but biotechnology companies will
increasingly be judged on their ability to actually deliver
products for sale.

CERAMICS

Less Hype--and
Some Real Growth

One important aspect of the U.S. advanced ceramics industry now is
that the Ceramics Fever of the early and mid-1980s has gone and
a new realization has come among the suppliers of advanced ceramic
components. One good example was the hype over ceramic engines,
thought to be a reality for the 1990s with the component suppliers
competing for shares of a market which failed to materialize.

Another setback to the U.S. advanced ceramics industry has been the
drastic cuts in U.S. military programs.  A good example of this is
the militarys earlier plan to use ceramic armor on land-based
vehicles by the late 1980s.  This has been postponed to a later
date and in some cases abandoned altogether.

BCC has been studying the various advanced ceramics market segments
for the last 10 years.  The recession in the early 1990s had
severely affected certain segments of the advanced ceramics
industry such as structural ceramics and in a limited way, the
ceramic coating business.  Electronic ceramics has not been much
affected by the last fact. The electronics segment has been growing
at a faster rate than our own earlier forecast in 1990 and 1992.

In a recent study to be published in March 1996 (DCD96, Complete
Guide to the U.S. Advanced Ceramics Industry), BCC has attempted to
analyze the overall market potential in the U.S.  BCC has further
estimated the size of the 1995 and future market potential for the
various advanced ceramics market segments in the U.S.  The total
value of the U.S. advanced ceramic components market for 1995 is
estimated to be $5.5 billion.  This will increase to $8.7 billion
by the year 2000 with a growth rate of 9.5% from 1995 to 2000.

Sewing Up 1995 Figures,
Projecting into 1996

Economists participating in the Blue Chip survey of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, anticipate a 2.4% rate of real economic
growth in 4th quarter 1995--well below last quarters 4.2% advance.
The recent flatness in industrial production and hours worked seems
consistent with this slowdown.  For all of 1995, the Blue Chip
panel foresees a growth rate of approximately 3.2%.  Economists
estimate the nations long-term growth potential at roughly 2.5%
per year.

A boom in business fixed investment has accompanied the current
business expansion, but curiously, the underlying factors have not
ignited residential construction.  Despite some improvement in the
3rd quarter of 1995, new home construction has been a relatively
weak component of GDP this year.  Real residential investment fell
1.4% in the four quarters ending in quarter three of 1995.  With
single-unit housing starts remaining generally weak, residential
construction will most likely stay soft.  Housing starts declined
1.7% in October, the second consecutive monthly drop.

An interesting note, although probably nothing that will take
shape, is that the latest inflation indicators are showing
surprising volatility.  After a four-month gain of only 1.8%, the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated to a 4.0% annualized rate in
October.

The median CPE--a measure of core inflation--slowed to 3.3%,
hovering between its year-to-date and five-year rates.

Taking a longer perspective, the 12-month change in the CPI and the
median CPI rose to 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.  Both are higher
than 1994 rates, but are still within or below the central tendency
range projected by the Federal Open Market Committee last July.

The Blue Chip forecast paints a far more favorable picture of
expected inflation.  The November 10 projection shows significant
improvement over forecasts made at the beginning of the year.  In
January, over 57% of economists were predicting that inflation
would reach 3.5% of more.  In November, that share fell to less
than 5%.

The National Assn. of Business Economists (1233 20th St. NW, Suite
505, Washington, DC 20036; Tel: 202/463-6223), forecasts
international trade as a source of growth for 1996.  Net exports
should average $116.4 billion, an improvement of $7.5 billion over
1995.

The largest consumer markets in the world--China, India, and the
many countries that comprise the ex-Soviet Union--are in a state of
fundamental transition, and are potentially very lucrative markets.
China, for example, is gradually letting other countries into its
markets.  Chinas electronics market has experienced an over 20%
average annual growth rate during the 1990s, and is expected to
reach $40 billion in semiconductor sales in 1996.  And the market
is far from mature.  Mexico is another tantalizing market,
especially for U.S. companies to explore, provided CEOs can stomach
the dips, twists and turns that the Mexican market endures.

As the world becomes a truly global marketplace, more risk is going
hand-in-hand with more opportunity.  Multinational corporations
(MNCs) and companies looking to do business in foreign countries
will need to make a switch in their organizations. One way to
better position the organization is instead of just happening to
have expatriates in various countries around the world, companies
will start reorganizing their management structure to create a
culture of international-savvy managers who will help in getting
the most out of the outstanding economic opportunities that are
presenting themselves in foreign countries. This will make the
organization more flexible, with better understanding and ability
to handle the foreign markets.

In the next year, MNCs will probably start to undertake changes in
organization.  After assessing opportunities around the world, and
taking into account technologies such as video conferencing, a flat
organizational structure will take hold. There will be switches to
several headquarters, instead of one central one in the dominant
country.  Each region that is economically important will receive
an important group of professionals from the headquarters.

In the world we will soon see, top management all from the same
country will be a weakness of a MNC.  Managements understanding of
the culture in a foreign market by persons either from or very
familiar with the country will prove to be the difference between
the most successful MNCs and the also-rans.

Commerce Department
Reduces Export Controls

Action by the Commerce Department to reduce export controls that
create obstacles such as licensing burdens and delays for U.S.
semiconductor companies drew nothing but praise from the
Semiconductor Industry Association (181 Metro Drive, Suite 450, San
Jose, CA 95110; Tel: 408/436-6600, Fax: 408/436-6646).  The new
regulation, which went into effect Dec. 20, liberalizes export
controls on certain semiconductor devices shipped to China, the
republics of the former Soviet Union, and certain other
destinations for civilian end uses.

In a statement released to coincide with the start of the new
policy, SIA President Thomas W. Armstrong said, "This modernization
of export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless
and costly licensing delays and burdensome paperwork.  These
reductions will lead to further export opportunities in areas with
major growth potential over the next decade."

The SIA notes that commercial semiconductors represent one of the
least controllable and most widely available high-technology
products in the world today.  Further maintenance of the old export
controls would have damaged U.S. industry without making any
material contribution to U.S. security.

Armstrong added, "The Commerce Department has made substantial
progress in the reduction of outmoded export licensing
requirements.  Continuation of this export liberalization process
to reflect the end of the Cold war will only stimulate business
opportunities and job creation."

In a related development, SIA also reported that the foreign share
in the Japan market for semiconductors rose more than 3% in the
third quarter to 26.2%.  Though no specific figures regarding the
U.S. share of the increase were available, Armstrong touted the
competitiveness of domestic chip makers as well as the U.S.-Japan
agreement as major factors.  SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said that
indications pointed to a substantial U.S. share in the increase.

Armstrong also added that strong relationships between the U.S.
and Japanese industries are being built, which would not have been
possible without the agreement.  Weir emphasized the SIAs support
for renewal of the pact, due this year, which is meeting some
resistance in Japan.

Managed Care
Is Really Here

Healthcare delivery in the U.S. and in most countries throughout
the world will experience significant change in 1996. The challenge
of  boards, management and physicians, says Albert W. Herman,
partner in charge of the Healthcare Services Group of global
accounting, tax and advisory firm Arthur Andersen LLP, will be to
provide the right care, at the right time, in the right amount, in
the right way and be able to prove it.

Market-based changes continue to challenge physicians, executives
and boards of directors in the healthcare industry.  Mergers,
alliances and affiliations among and between providers will
continue unabated in 1996, and managed care will continue its
market penetration across the country, according to Herman.

Based on the latest data available, about 18% of the total U.S.
population is enrolled in some type of managed care arrangement;
about 9% of all Medicare beneficiaries are in a managed care plan,
and about 23% of all Medicaid enrollees are in managed care as
well.  These percentages all will show marked increases in 1996.

At the same time, the debate and decisions from Capitol Hill, the
White House, and the state capitals will continue to influence
provider decision-making as will the initiatives and investigations
pursued by regulators such as the Dept. of Justice, Inspector
General, FBI, IRS, and the SEC.

The managed care market will mature as employers encourage workers
to switch to managed care, and as leading managed care groups and
medical groups begin to consolidate.  The momentum for direct
contracting between the payer and the care provider will grow in
1996, as will enrollee choice of their healthcare providers.
Eventually, managed care risk will shift to integrated delivery
systems, purchasers will contract with these systems for
comprehensive services, and capitation will prevail.

Rapid Change In
Device Market

Daphne Allen, assistant editor of Medical Device & Diagnostic
Industry, has analyzed the growth in the number of registered
medical device manufacturers in the U.S.  Data were obtained from
the FDAs Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance, which is a
part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

During the period between August 1994 and August 1995, the FDA
recorded an increase of 1,737 registered medical device companies.
Overall, however, the total number of medical device establishments
has declined by 2%.  In addition to companies who leave the device
industry, the decline may be attributed to mergers, acquisitions,
consolidation of sites, and business failures.

The study indicated that six states provide the homes of nearly 47%
of the registered manufacturers.  California led the pack with
1,920 companies; New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida, and
Texas are also important locations for manufacturers.  The analysis
was published in Volume 17, No. 10

Fluorine Compounds
Surge Past Problems

Fluorine compounds are all around us and we use them every day,
despite the fact that most people do not know them as such.
"Performance chemicals" can be defined as those which do a specific
job, based on their physical and/or chemical properties, that other
products and materials do not do as well.

As a market for potential growth, total sales for performance
fluorine and chemical polymers should grow from a market value of
$3.8 billion in 1994 to reach $4.1 billion by 1999, an average
annual growth rate (AAGR) of 1.8%.

Chlorofluorocarbons are the largest segment of the total market as
well as the problem that needs to be untangled for the entire
market to sustain growth, but other segments of the fluorine and
chemical polymers market will see respectable growth at least up to
the next century.

Aromatics, a segment of organic fluorochemicals used primarily for
chemical processing, have a 1994 market value of $6 million,
forecasted to grow to $7 million by 1999, resulting in an AAGR of
5.9%

Inorganic fluorochemicals perform many diverse uses, ranging from
fluorides for water treatment and toothpaste, to the large volume
hydrogen fluoride and expensive, highly pure electronic etchants.
The 1994 market value for all inorganics was $567 million,
projected to reach $647 million by 1999, resulting in a 2.7% AAGR.

Fluoropolymers consist of polymer resins such as PTFE and PVDF,
fluoroelastomers, and low molecular weight polymers used as
surfactants, functional fluids, textile finishing chemicals to
impart water and oil repellency, and as chemical intermediates.
The 1994 market value for fluoropolymers is $1.35 billion and will
be $1.76 billion by 1999, reaching a 5.4% AAGR.

Business Communications Co., Inc. has recently published a study
titled Performance Fluorine and Chemical Polymers: Future
Prospects.

Carbon Nitride: A
Designer Abrasive

Scientists at the Carnegie Institution (Washington, DC) have used
a combination of state-of-the-art physics, supercomputers, and
insight gained from the study of minerals to predict the first
feasibly synthesizable material that is more incompressible than
diamond. Their calculations show that this material, a cubic form
of carbon nitride, C3N4, should be significantly less compressible
than diamond at room conditions.

Inasmuch as low compressibility is correlated with hardness, it is
highly possible that the new material could be harder than diamond
and therefore of significant technological use as a superabrasive
material and for wear-resistant coatings.

These results, reported in the January 5 issue of Science , rest
upon state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The levels
of speed and accuracy now attainable in such calculations enable
investigators to design materials by doing experiments on the
computer instead of in the laboratory. Scientists are thus
beginning to rationally design useful materials in a more efficient
manner than by the traditional "shake-and-bake" methodology of
finding new materials.

The investigators in the new work are David Teter and Russell
Hemley, both serving at Carnegie's Geophysical Lab and Center for
High Pressure Research. Teter and Hemley's work grew from
widespread interest in the possibility of finding new low
compressibility materials. Various forms of carbon nitrides had
been proposed as possible superhard materials potentially exceeding
diamond in hardness. Teter and Hemley identified several favorable
candidate C3N4 prototype forms and calculated their energetics,
structures and physical properties. They determined the cubic-C3N4
form to be the most incompressible.

Their calculations indicate that the cubic- C3N4 material can be
synthesized at pressures and temperatures now attainable in the
laboratory. (The material would be formed at high pressure and
temperature, and then quenched stably to ambient conditions.)
Scientists at the Carnegie institution and elsewhere are already
working to accomplish this, employing insights gained from the
theoretical work now reported. Conceivably, the material can
eventually be synthesized at an industrial scale using technology
similar to that now used to synthesize industrial diamond.

Teter and Hemley write that most experimental studies of carbon
nitrides have been carried out at ambient or low-pressure
conditions; their results indicate the importance of high-pressure
synthesis in the search for new carbon nitrides.

Home Office Workers
Are a Dynamic Market

Home offices have been in existence for years, from the employees
who are scheduled to work at home, to the after hours workers, and
including the self-employed home office worker.   Only recently,
though, have the home office workers become in vogue, their needs
just beginning to be addressed by office equipment manufacturers.
According to a new report from Business Communications Co., Inc.,
home office workers are a market segment with purchasing power
needing computers, peripherals, software,  office products and
ancillary services.

In report G-189 The Home Office: Markets for Equipment, Supplies
and Services, despite marginal growth in the overall workforce by
the year 2000, the home office segment will expand from 45.7
million individuals in 1995 to 60.9 million workers by 2000,
resulting in an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 5.9%.

Computers are an essential part of many home offices.  In 1995,
home office workers purchased over $13 billion worth of all types
of computers. The market is expected to grow to nearly $30 billion
by the year 2000,  reaching a 17.5% AAGR.

It is up to the manufacturers to recognize potential specialized
equipment to target this consumer group. Fully configured products,
such as computers or some peripherals, that can be accommodated
within smaller spaces would be the first logical product niche, as
the typical home office is in the basement or in the corner of the
living room, or may be in a spare bedroom.

The peripheral market segment for the home office includes
printers, software, modems, ISDN, email,  and related technologies
and remote access.  In 1995, the peripheral market for home offices
was over $42 billion.  By the year 2000, the forecast for the
peripheral market is for it to reach over $70 billion, resulting in
an AAGR of 10.8%.

The entire home office consumer purchases in 1995 was over $79
billion worth of equipment for their office environment.  The 2000
projection for this market is for the home office consumer to spend
over $132 billion, reaching a 10.7% AAGR.

'Ghost Sites' On The
World Wide Web

International Data Corp. (IDC, Five Speen St., Framingham, MA
01701) has predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment as
investors and corporations suffer through the discouragingly slow
development of a significant consumer base. By the end of the year,
IDC predicts 20% of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial
Web sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost
sites. The leading online information service providers will derive
more than one-half of their revenue from providing access to the
Web by mid-1997.

IDC predicts that "In 1996 ... the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's 'intoxication' stage to a
'hangover' stage. The high-flying Internet suppliers will have
disappointing financial results, while technical capabilities of
the Internet are stretched to the breaking point." Although IDC
predicts the overall growth in online subscribers will continue to
be very strong, they expect 1996 to show a high turnover rate as
users disappointed by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscriptions.

But, they also predict that during the next five years, the number
of online users will rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it
will exceed 1 billion. Industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate spending
will rise from 2 to 2.5% of revenues to more than 5%. In addition,
IDC believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more
by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

A full copy of IDC's 1996 predictions can be found on IDC's home
page. The address is http://www.idcresearch.com. Interested parties
are welcome to share views and insights with Frank Gens, senior VP
of research at IDC, via email at fgens@idcresearch.com. For more

Virtual Reality
Is No Illusion

Virtual reality (VR) has been identified as one of the 10 most
promising technologies currently under development.  This new
technology brings upon itself many problems, including the effect
science fiction has had on the perception of VR technology as well
as difficulties in defining the technology.  Nonetheless, there
remains a class of technology that can confidently be defined as
"virtual reality" and analyzed like any other emerging high tech
industry.  This technology is currently used on a routine basis in
a number of markets, and has the potential to enter many more.

At the end of 1995, over 300 companies will sell approximately $255
million worth of VR products and services.  By 2000, the VR
industry will be posting annual sales of over $1 billion and
reaching an annual average growth rate (AAGR) of 33%.  Although
about half of the 2000 market will go for home- and site- based
entertainment, VR products will be used by all facets of society,
including commercial/industrial, the government, military, and
university and secondary schools.

A comprehensive document from Business Communications Co., Inc.
entitled The Virtual Reality Business, reports that the
instructional and developmental market for VR is expected to grow
from a $95 million 1995 market figure to $355 million by 2000,
resulting in an AAGR of 31%.  This figure includes VR technology
that will be present in technical/engineering colleges and
universities, and the "developmental" VR includes spending on
advanced, but as yet non-commercial applications, along with pure
science and research systems not included in the other categories.

Applications of design and development VR market are in
engineering, architecture and chemical design and development.
This market will grow from a 1995 market value of $30 million, to
$150 million by 2000, reaching an AAGR of 40%.

Entertainment uses account for the largest VR market value, and are
expected to continue growing at a 35% AAGR to the year 2000.  A
mass-produced single-user entertainment VR system will be the
driving force behind the growth of this market growth, from a 1995
value of $110 million to $500 million by 2000.

Medical treatment VR market will also sustain growth.  The 1995
market value of $20 million is projected to reach $50 million by
2000, reaching a 20% AAGR.

Mid-IR Laser
Likes it Warm

A team of scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory and the
University of Houston Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) has
developed a mid-infrared solid-state laser that operates at near
room temperature.

According to Shin-Shem Steven Pei, SVEC's associate director for
research (Tel: 713/ 743-3621, E-mail: spei@uh.edu), lasing was
observed at temperatures up to 285K. "This is by far the highest
operating temperature for an interband transition laser at this
wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device that works with a
compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy cryogenic
system, and room-temperature operation is just around the corner."

The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-II
quantum-well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4
microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVEC
and then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing the
material growth and device design for diode lasers that can produce
sufficient power at 3 to 5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVEC
scientists are also testing a more advanced quantum-cascade laser
design, which should produce higher-intensity light with less
electric current while emitting within either of two atmospheric
transmission windows of 3 to 5 microns and 8 to 12 microns.

Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,
medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicle
and air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covert
illumination for night vision, free-space communications, and IR
countermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly in
these windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.
This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse-
gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical process
control, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IR
systems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compact
IR sources are available.

The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at much
shorter wavelengths. Long-distance telephone networks use 1.3 and
1.5 micron lasers in their optical fiber systems, and a 0.8 micron
beam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible light
ranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readily
absorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmission
windows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within the
windows are too bulky and expensive for most commercial
applications.

Display Panels Made
from Plastic Wrap

U.S. Patent 5,469,020 was issued on Nov. 21, 1995, to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a flexible large-screen
display that has multiple light-emitting elements sandwiched
between crossed electrodes.  The inventor is Bradley R. Herrick
(Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/981-3356).  The
resulting panels are especially well adapted to inexpensive flat-
panel TV screens or exceptionally large flat-panel displays whose
geometry is not limited to flat surfaces, but may take on curved or
cylindrical configurations.

The patent abstract explains that active light-emitting components
are integrated into a thin, flexible, plastic-wrap like film to
provide an exceptionally large continuous display in which the film
contains densely distributed light-emitting elements that are
addressed by a grid of transparent conductors.  Inexpensive bulk
processing techniques are used to produce plastic wrap with
embedded components completely through the film to permit
activation via a row-column matrix.  The displays are comprised of
a flexible film having two opposing sides and a pair of crossed
electrodes on either side of the film.  A number of light-emitting
elements are dispersed`ig the film and extend from one side of the
film to the other, sandwiched between the crossed electrodes.  The
light-emitting elements are small enough to permit numbers of the
elements to exist at a crossover.

The topological layout provides mass redundancy of components,
spatial decorrelation of component yields, and dramatic reduction
in registration problems of metallic interconnects.  The design can
be used for electroluminescent tape in automotive pin striping and
sign applications, for flexible glue-on displays, and for video
displays such as workstations, HDTV, theater screens, and
billboards.

Herrick explained that the patent is based on theory for the time
being, and that no working models currently exist.  He also said
that calculations indicate that the thinner the plastic the better,
and he would initially be working with films in the 10 to 100
micron thickness range.  The concept involves placing up to
hundreds of diodes in a single pixel, making the technology most
suitable to displays larger than 60 inches diagonally and scaleable
to even larger sizes.  He is currently assembling a production team
and says the only real problem is the same one faced industry-wide
-- blue diodes.

Interactive Holography
Will Be Evaluated

American Propylaea Corp. (555 S. Woodward, Birmingham, MI 48009;
Tel: 810/642-7000) has been awarded a $100,000 research contract by
the U.S. Air Force to evaluate the integration of interactive
holography in manufacturing.  James Fischbach, president and CEO,
reports that the contract represents Phase 1 of a projected 15-
phase $200 million project if Phase 1 is successful.  Phase 2 would
involve $750,000, and Phase 3 would be worth $5 million.

American Propylaea, which developed the worlds first full color
commercial hologram in 1993, scored a major breakthrough in 1994
when it achieved a 42 inch x 45 inch, full motion, true color
holographic display system, the largest yet developed.  Fischbach
predicts that holography will be a $5 billion per year business
within 10 years and identifies the automotive, entertainment,
medical, and retail markets as those with the greatest potential.

Fischbach says that interactive holography could make it possible
for automakers to cut design and development time by 50%, enabling
them to bring new car models to market in under 20 months, compared
with the present 42 months in the U.S. and 36 months in Japan.
Holography could also reduce the need for exploratory surgery and
assist in the training of surgeons, enabling them to view 3-D
information in free space in front of a monitor screen to help them
detect and locate abnormalities and rehearse operations.

Low Temperature
Growth Method

A chemist at Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO
63130) has discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals
at temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the
first to use solution phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sized
crystals at low temperature.  The semiconductors made by the new
method may be used in devices such as light emitting diode (LED)
displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc players
and computer components.  The breakthrough offers intriguing
possibilities of developing integrated devices consisting of
semiconductors and polymers, plastics or composites.

Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combining
other materials with the semiconductors because of the very high
temperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currently
produced at temperatures of 500-1,200C, but the method William E.
Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, email: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu), associate
professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, has
discovered allows growth at 200C.  Buhros technique, the
solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method, is similar to the vapor-
liquid-solid (VLS) gas phase growth method which has been used for
some 30 years.

Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by the
nonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which do
not allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at low
temperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium and
indium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are the
sites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds indium
phosphide, gallium arsenide and indium arsenide (type III-V
semiconductors) nucleate and grow.

Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solid
mechanism, a three phase system where the chemistry occurs in
solution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited into
the liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizes
out as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is to
turn down the heat on solid state synthesis.  This new method
expands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.

Building a New Flat
Panel Video Screen

A researcher at the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Lab
(Box 5000, Upton, NY 11973-5000) has invented a flat panel video
screen that uses lasers as a light source.  Uses of the device may
include video advertising displays, television, computers,
automotive dashboard and aircraft cockpit displays, as well as
portable military maps and wall-sized displays for home
entertainment.  Since the Brookhaven device has advantages in
brightness, contrast, and viewing angle over the new generation of
liquid crystal cockpit displays, the U.S. Air Force is funding
development of the flat panel device for use in its new planes.

In another project involving the new technology funded by the Dept.
of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),
Brookhaven also is working on a 5 ft. plastic television screen for
military use.

The Clinton Administration has identified developing flat panel
displays as vital to the economic future of the U.S.  Brookhaven
engineer James Veligdan (Tel: 516/282-5400) invented the device and
developed the display screen prototype, which is 9 in. wide by 5
in. high and approximately 1 in. thick.  The new flat panel screen
has several advantages over current technologies.

Many video display systems now on the market use cathode ray tubes
(CRTs).  Although reliable, they are very large, heavy, and not
easily transportable.  Other than CRTs, the major current video
display technology is limited to liquid crystal displays (LCDs),
which are comparatively difficult and expensive to manufacture.

The Brookhaven technology works by directing light from a miniature
laser to a scanner, which guides the light beam into the proper
sector of laminated wave guides.  Composed of multiple sheets of
laminated borosilicate glass or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
plastic, the waveguides direct the light to the screen to display
the video image.

"The system is totally eye safe, high-contrast, and offers
exceptionally wide viewing angles.  Also, the screen can be used in
cold weather, whereas liquid crystals thicken and freeze as
temperatures dip below freezing.  The technology can be adapted to
display 3D images if the viewer wears polarized glasses.
Maintenance is easy and inexpensive, says Veligdan.
