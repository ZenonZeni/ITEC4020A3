<p><font size=3>Filippo Grassia obtained his Degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Genoa 
in 1970. In December 1971 he joined the Institute for Naval Automation (IAN) of Italy&#146;s 
National Research Council (CNR) as a Research Scientist. In June 1988 he was promoted 
Senior Research Scientist and in April 1991 was nominated Research Manager for 
Electrotechnics, Measurement and Automatic Control after a nationwide public selection.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Since 15 October 1990 he has been Director of the Naval Automation Institute. Under his 
guidance, the Institute&#146;s research involvement in the field of marine technology has made a 
considerable leap forward, and impulse has also been given to securing national and 
international research contracts, which each year provide additional funding that doubles 
the Institute&#146;s basic budgetary allocation.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>In his early years at IAN-CNR, his research activity centred on the development of 
software for vessel operation, the study of algorithms and mathematical models for 
computer-assisted navigation and the testing of these programs on board commercial 
vessels and later on CNR&#146;s research vessels.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>He has served on the organizing and/or scientific committees of numerous national and 
international congresses in the field of automatic systems for safety in maritime navigation 
and engineering of marine systems. From 1982 to 1986 he was responsible for the 
Italo-Spanish research programme managed by the Universitat Politecnica de Cataluna in 
Barcelona, which was undertaken by IAN-CNR and the Institute of Cybernetics of the 
above university. The programme focused on studies and testing of &quot;Navigation Safety in 
Congested Waters and/or Straits&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>From 1983 to 1986 he participated in the project for &quot;Shorebased Aids to Maritime 
Navigation&quot; under the European Union&#146;s COST 301 Programme and coordinated 
experimental trials carried out by an international partnership that included Italy. The aim 
was to determine the feasibility of constructing a Mediterranean-wide system for 
surveillance and assistance to maritime navigation.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>He serves on numerous Italian commissions for maritime traffic and marine environment 
technology. From 1985 to 1990, he coordinated IAN&#146;s research efforts in the following 
national research projects:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>feasibility study for an oceanographic ship;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>network of open-sea meteo-oceanographic buoys;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>innovative approaches to the design and management of bases and 
systems for marine environment monitoring.</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3>He leads IAN&#146;s research in SNECOW (Shipping Noise Evaluation in Coastal Waters), a 
project funded by the EC MAST I Programme. (When)He was appointed Member of the 
Advisory Committee of CNR&#146;s &quot;Trasporti Due&quot; Applied Project. In December 1991 he 
was appointed by the Italian Ministry for Research to an international commission of 
experts responsible for evaluating proposals submitted to the European Union under the 
MAST II Programme.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Since 1993 he has been on the Consultory Board of the National Institute for Naval 
Research and Architecture (INSEAN); he was also appointed by the Ministry for 
Research to the Technical Scientific Committee for the development of applied research in 
the naval field within the Ministry for the Merchant Navy. In 1994 he was nominated 
scientific counsellor for the Centre of Marine-Maritime Technology in Genoa</font></p>
<p><font size=3>He has published over 80 papers in science journals, in the proceedings of national and 
international congresses and within internal technical reports documenting external contracts 
and specific projects.&#160;</font></p>
