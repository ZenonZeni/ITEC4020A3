   Industry Group Rebuffs U.S. On Encryption
<br>
   By John Markoff
<p>

   The campaign by the Clinton Administration to create a
   standard for data encryption acceptable to industry, civil
   liberties and law enforcement groups broke down yesterday
   when a group including some of the nation's most powerful
   technology companies rejected a compromise proposal.
<p>
   The aim is to set a policy that meets the needs of
   electronic commerce as well as the concerns of the National
   Security Agency and other Federal offices that are opposed
   to the proliferation of data-coding software, feeling it
   will make it impossible for them to gather intelligence
   overseas.
<p>
   The Administration offered a compromise plan and had been
   seeking comment from the public. But the industry coalition
   said yesterday that it found the Government unwilling to
   compromise. Thus, the group of 37 companies said, it would
   formulate its own policy proposal to present to the White
   House and to Congress in the next six months.
<p>
   High-technology industries want a data-coding standard
   secure enough that both businesses and overseas customers
   could use it for sensitive financial and business
   correspondence. They seek a longer and more powerful
   encryption key than the Government is willing to grant, and
   object to Government demands that law enforcement agencies
   have "back-door" access to such transmissions that would
   allow them to intercept coded messages.
<p>
   The letter is signed by several of the country's leading
   computer, software and on-line companies, among them
   America Online, Apple Computer, AT&T, Eastman Kodak
   I.B.M.'s Lotus Development division, MCI Communications,
   Microsoft, Novell, Oracle Sybase and Tandem Computers.
<p>
   On Aug. 17, the Administration proposed a liberalization of
   export-control procedures for "key escrow" software
   products, or those providing law-enforcement access.
<p>
   "The current policy directive also does not address the
   need for immediate liberalization of current export
   restrictions," the letter said "Such liberalization is
   vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-art
   software products during the potentially lengthy process of
   developing and adopting a comprehensive national
   cryptography policy."
