Here's a look at how an international sunroof manufacturer <BR>
is meeting the requirements of the American market, <BR>
which is very different from the market in its home base.

<P>One of the companies that Prof. Simon cites in his book is Webasto AG, which he describes as &quot;a double hidden champion...the world leader in both sunroofs and auxiliary heating systems for cars.&quot; Webasto was established in Germany earlier in this century; its first folding roof--and in the context of this article we'll be concentrating on the roofs, not the heaters--was produced in 1932. Its first OE customer was Mercedes in 1936. The company has grown to have sunroof divisions in Brazil, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U.S. According to Brett Healy, director of Sales &amp; Marketing, Webasto AG is the world's largest supplier of OE sunroof systems, producing approximately 50% of them, or about 3.5 million units per year.

<P>Webasto Sunroofs Inc. (Rochester Hills, MI) is a joint venture between Webasto AG and Magna International. Healy explains that Webasto AG uses the joint venture approach in order to enter markets that it is unfamiliar with. And the U.S. market is actually one that is comparatively different from other parts of the world, particularly Europe. The installation rate of sunroofs in Great Britain is 70%. The rate is 50% in Germany. In the U.S. the penetration is about 10%. This lower rate--growing, but still low--means that processing must be performed with different methodologies in the U.S.

<P>Consider, for example, that whereas the average sunroof program for a European vehicle is on the order of 200,000 to 250,000 units per year, the number is more like 25,000 units in the U.S. So due to volume considerations alone, there are unique processing demands for the North American market.

<P>Alexander J. Mullejans, manager, Manufacturing Engineering, at Webasto Sunroofs, came to the U.S. from Webasto AG slightly less than three years ago. One of the challenges he and his colleagues faced was to develop a system that would allow the manufacture of sunroofs in a flexible manner so that changeovers could be effected rapidly on a line. In Germany, he points out, the production lines tend to be dedicated because of the high volume of sunroofs produced. That dedicated automation wouldn't work efficiently in the U.S. due to the lower volumes. The ability to make switches and modifications without sacrificing quality was what they were up against.

<P>Mullejans explains that the issue was not merely of developing a new and better assembly line for the sunroofs. Rather, it was a combined process, one that involved working with the product engineers so that the sunroofs were not only manufacturable, but shared enough component commonality so that line changeovers could be effected without completely purging all components from the line, thereby helping boost available assembly time. The product and the process were considered at the same time.

<P>(This part commonization has the effect of reducing warehousing requirements, which is a part of an overall program at the Webasto site to have efficient space utilization. The company is on track to double the output of its existing sunroof assembly facility between 1994 and 1997 without the addition of bricks and mortar. In addition to part commonization, contributing factors are improved plant layouts, attention to the entire supply 
chain, and more efficient assembly lines.)

<P>The program was initiated in late 1994. A team consisting of representatives of the various involved functions (marketing, engineering, manufacturing, etc.) was organized. Then there was benchmarking of various Webasto European facilities. Mullejans notes that one facility of particular interest was S.A.R.L. Webasto Heuliez, which in 1990 began the installation of a modular bottom-load style sunroof.

<P>One of the biggest differences between common practice in the U.S. and elsewhere is the prevailing design of the sunroof. Here the standard is to have a top-load system. To assemble sunroofs for this design, after the roof is prepared*, the sunroof mechanism (the glass and the brackets and the channels, etc.) is loaded from the top in the assembly plant while the motor and controls are installed from the bottom. There are, as a result, two separate mechanisms that are joined only at final assembly.

<P>But in the bottom-load design, the entire sunroof mechanism is a single assembly. Among the advantages of this design are the ability to assure the functionality of the entire unit at the point of assembly, but easier installation.

<P>After checking out how the French handled their sunroofs, the team went to Germany, where the higher volume production meant more automation was being used to produce assemblies. The French approach to the component was determined to be the right one. And some of the methods used in Germany (in addition to automation, there is a great deal of team-organized work approaches which Mullejans notes were found to be advantageous) were carefully documented.

<P>With this information, it was back to Michigan to develop the modular-style bottom-load sunroof designs and the assembly lines, each of which will run from three to five different programs per year, with an average of 35,000 sunroofs per program. The tooling for the lines was ordered in 1995. Two lines went into production in the summer of 1996, with the third planned to come on stream next year.

<P>&quot;What we have now,&quot; Mullejans says, &quot;is a quality-oriented and cost-effective way to produce sunroofs for the American market.&quot;
