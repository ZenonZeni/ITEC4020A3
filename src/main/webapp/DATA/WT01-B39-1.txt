<p> The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of
Federal or State correctional authorities was 1,053,738 at
yearend 1994. During the year the States and the District of
Columbia added 78,847 prisoners; the Federal system, 5,447.
Although the 1994 growth rate (8.6%) nearly equaled the average
annual percent increase since 1980, the total increase of 83,294
was the second largest yearly increase on record. </p>

<p> * California (125,605) and Texas (118,195) together held more
than 1 in every 5 inmates in the Nation. Seventeen States, each
holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held 4% of all
prisoners. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1994, State prisons were operating at between
17% and 29% above capacity, while the Federal system was
operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> * Since 1980 the Nation's prison population more than doubled
on a per capita basis. On December 31, 1994, the number of
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents was 387-up from
139 in 1980. </p>

<p> * States with the highest incarceration rates were Texas
(636), Louisiana (530), and Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had
the lowest rate, followed by Minnesota (100), West Virginia
(106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> * In 1993 (the latest available data), the incarceration rate
of blacks was 7 times that of whites. At yearend there were 1,471
black inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents compared to 207
white inmates per 100,000 white residents. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The percentage of State prisoners serving a drug sentence
        increased almost 3-fold from 1980 to 1993 (6% to 22%).
        The percentage of Federal prisoners serving a drug
        sentence more than doubled, from 25% in 1980 to 60% in
        1993. </li>
    <li>In recent years, although the number of drug offenders in
        the Nation's prisons grew dramatically (55,500 from 1990
        to 1993), the number of violent offenders grew the most
        (up 82,100). </li>

<p> -------------------------------------- </p>

<p> State and Federal prisons housed two-thirds of all persons
incarcerated in the United States--the other third were in local
jails. </p>

<p> The 1994 growth rate of 8.6% was greater than the percentage
increase recorded during 1993 (7.4%). The 1994 increase
translates into a nationwide need to confine an additional 1,602
inmates each week. </p>

<p> Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1994, growing by 8.6 % during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsentenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States
with combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased less than
that of sentenced State prisoners during 1994 (7.3% versus 8.7%).
The rate of increase slowed to about half the 1993 growth rate. </p>

<p> During 1994 prison populations increased in 16 States by at
least 10%. Texas reported the largest increase (28.5%), followed
by Georgia (20.3%), Nevada (16.0%), Virginia (14.6%), and
Wisconsin (14.1%). Three States and the District of Columbia
experienced less than 2% growth. The District had the smallest
percentage growth (.9%), followed by Oklahoma (1.4%), South
Carolina (1.6%), and Massachusetts (1.6%). </p>

<p> Fifty-six percent of the increase during 1994 was accounted
for by Texas (26,182), California (5,654), Georgia (5,642), the
Federal system (5,447), and Florida (4,091). These jurisdictions
incarcerate over 40% of the Nation's prison population. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1980, 1 in every 453 U.S. residents were
incarcerated; by yearend 1993, that figure grew to 1 in every
189. </p>

<p> * From 1980 to 1993, the total number of persons held in the
custody of State, Federal, and local jail jurisdictions grew by
about 863,000 persons. Sixty-two percent of the growth can be
attributed to the growth in number of State prisoners (533,000). </p>

<ul>
    <li>Between 1980 and 1993, the Federal prison population grew
        at faster rate (an average of 9.9% per year) than the
        combined State populations (8.2%) and the Nation's local
        jail populations (7.3%). Despite the higher growth rate,
        only 5.9% of all inmates were held in Federal prisons in
        1993, up from 4.7% in 1980. </li>
    <li>* On December 31, 1993, almost 4.9 million persons were
        under some form of correctional supervision, including
        2.8 million adults on probation and 671,000 on parole.
        The percentage distribution of the total corrections
        population was-- </li>

<p> Confinement 28.0% </p>

<p> Federal prisons 1.7 </p>

<p> State prisons 17.0 </p>

<p> Local jails 9.3 </p>

<p> Community supervision 72.0% </p>

<p> Parole 13.7 </p>

<p> Probation 58.3 </p>

<p> * Between 1980 and 1993, the number of persons under
correctional supervision increased by more than 3 million. About
19% of this increase occurred because of the growth in the State
and Federal prison populations. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> Rates of incarceration increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1994, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents was 387. Of the 14 States with rates
greater than the rate for the Nation, 11 were in the South, 2
were in the West, and 1 was in the Midwest. Four States, North
Dakota (78), Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine
(118) had rates that were less than a third of the national rate.
</p>

<p> The District of Columbia, a wholly urban jurisdiction, held
1,583 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents at yearend 1994.
Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents
has risen from 139 to 387. During this period, per capita
incarceration rates rose the most in the South (from 188 to 451)
and West (from 105 to 333). The rate in the Northeast rose from
87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest from 109 to 297. The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 residents
increased from 9 to 30 over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Southern States grew the fastest </p>

<p> During 1994 the average growth in the number of sentenced
State and Federal prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,542
additional bed spaces per week, about 179 more than the average
weekly growth in 1993. </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1994 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, a gain
of 13.1%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 6.2% in the
West, 5.8% in the Midwest, and 4.1% in the Northeast. In 29
States the percentage change in the number of sentenced prisoners
during 1994 was higher than that of 1993. </p>

<p> Among these jurisdictions, 16 had increases of at least 10%.
They were led by Texas (28.3%), Georgia (20.1%), Virginia
(14.9%), New Hampshire (13.9%), and Idaho (13.7%). In five States
(Delaware, Maine, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Massachusetts)
and the District of Columbia the number of sentenced prisoners
increased by less than 2%. In two States--Alaska and
Connecticut--the number of sentenced prisoners declined during
1994. Since 1989 net gains in the number of sentenced prisoners
have averaged about 1,162 prisoners per week--a gain of about
1,036 State prisoners and 125 Federal prisoners per week over the
period. The largest net gains occurred in the South (500 inmates
per week), followed by the West (213 inmates per week), the
Midwest (180 inmates per week), and the Northeast (144 inmates
per week). Texas accounted for 34% of the total growth in the 16
Southern States and the District of Columbia. California
accounted for two-thirds of the growth in the 13 Western States. </p>

<p> In 1994 the 10 States with the largest prison populations
held 55% of the total prison population nationwide, with
California, Texas, and New York accounting for nearly 30%. Texas
had the highest incarceration rate, with 636 sentenced prisoners
per 100,000 residents, followed by Louisiana (530) and Oklahoma
(508). </p>

<p> During 1994 the prison population in Texas grew the fastest,
increasing 28.5%. Over the past 5 years the State prison
population of New Hampshire grew the fastest, increasing 73.3%.
At yearend 1994 North Dakota had the lowest rate of incarceration
(78 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents), followed by
Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> Seventeen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates,
together held 4% of all prisoners in 1994. </p>

<p> The number of sentenced inmates has increased in every State
since 1989. Alaska (up 1.4% since 1989) and Maine (up 2.2%) had
the smallest percentage increases. Four other States had
increases of less than 20% in the last 5 years. Kansas had a
5-year rate of growth of 13.5%, followed by Nebraska (13.7%), New
Mexico (17.9%), and Wyoming (18.6%). </p>

<p> Female prisoner population grew at a faster pace The number
of female inmates (64,403) increased at a faster rate during 1994
(10.6%) than the number of male inmates (989,335 at 8.5%). </p>

<p> At the end of 1994 women accounted for 6.1% of all prisoners
nationwide. Relative to the number of women in the resident
population in the States in 1994, Oklahoma (with 96 female
inmates per 100,000 female residents) and Texas (with 94) led the
Nation. North Dakota (5 per 100,000) and Maine (9) had the lowest
female incarceration rates. In 1994, 28 States, the District of
Columbia, and the Federal system had more than 500 female
inmates. Among these jurisdictions, 14 had increases of at least
10%, led by the Texas increase of 27.2% (from 6,949 in 1993 to
8,839 in 1994). </p>

<p> Six States held fewer than 100 female inmates at yearend
1994. Women represented less than 4% of all prisoners in North
Dakota, Montana, and Vermont. In 1994, 7.5% of inmates in the
Federal system were female--higher than all State systems except
for Oklahoma (9.7%), Hawaii (7.7%), and Texas (7.5%). </p>

<p> Local jails held almost 49,000 prisoners because of State
prison crowding At the end of 1994, 23 jurisdictions reported a
total of 48,949 State prisoners held in local jails or
otherfacilities because of crowding in State facilities. Texas
accounted for 42% of the prisoners sentenced to prison but
incarcerated locally. Eight States--Louisiana, Texas, Virginia,
West Virginia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee, and
Idaho--held more than 10% of their prison population in local
jails. Overall, because of prison crowding, 4.6% of the State
prisoners were confined in local jails, down from 5.2% in 1993. </p>

<p> Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare The extent
of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult to determine
because of the absence of uniform measures for defining capacity.
The 52 reporting jurisdictions apply a wide variety of capacity
measures to reflect both available space to house inmates and the
ability to staff and operate an institution. To estimate the
capacity of the Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to
supply three measures for yearend 1994: rated, operational, and
design capacities. These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied rated
capacities, 43 provided operational capacities, and 37 submitted
design capacity. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-five
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity Prisons
generally require reserve capacity to operate efficiently.
Dormitories and cells need to be maintained and repaired
periodically, special housing is needed for protective custody
and disciplinary cases, and space may be needed to cope with
emergencies. At the end of 1994, 13 States and the District of
Columbia reported that they were operating at or below 99% of
their highest capacity. Forty-one States, the District of
Columbia and the Federal prison system reported operating at 100%
or more of their lowest capacity. By yearend, the Federal system
was estimated to be operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> State prisons were estimated to be operating at 117% of their
highest capacity and 129% of their lowest capacity. </p>

<p> Changing demographic characteristics </p>

<p> The demographic characteristics of the Nation's prison
population are changing. Since 1980 the number of female inmates
in the Nation's prisons has increased at a faster rate (up an
average 12.0% per year) than the number of male inmates (up an
average 8.5% per year.) Despite their faster population growth,
females comprised only 6% of all sentenced prisoners at yearend
1994. In 1994 the male incarceration rate, 746 per 100,000 male
residents, was more than 16 times higher than the female
incarceration rate--45 per 100,000 female residents. Increasing
percentages of State and Federal inmates are from racial or
ethnic minority groups. Between 1980 and 1993, the latest
available data, the percent of sentenced inmates who were black
rose from 46.5% to 50.8%. Relative to the number of residents in
the U.S. population, blacks at yearend 1993 were 7 times more
likely than whites to have been incarcerated in a State or
Federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 black
residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were
incarcerated in the Nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. </p>

<p> The number of prisoners with sentences of more than a year
rose 616,292 between 1980 and 1993 (up 195%). The number of white
males grew 163%, the number of black males 217%, the number of
white females 327%, and the number of black females 343%. </p>

<p> The growth in the number of black male prisoners (304,800)
accounted for nearly half of the total increase during the
13-year period. </p>

<p> Hispanics, who may be of any race, are the fastest growing
minority group--increasing from 7.7% of all State and Federal
inmates in 1980 to 14.3% in 1993. During this period, the
Hispanic incarceration rate more than tripled--from 163 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 Hispanic residents in 1980 to 529 per
100,000 Hispanic residents in 1993. At yearend 1993 nearly
139,000 Hispanics were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The total number of Hispanic inmates may actually be somewhat
larger. Because of variations in record keeping, some States are
unable to report data on Hispanic origin; other States report
estimates only; and others report only partial counts. Data from
past surveys of State inmates, which are based on inmate
self-identification during personal interviews, produce higher
estimates of the number of Hispanic inmates. </p>

<p> On December 31, 1993, nearly two-thirds of all sentenced
prison inmates were black, Asian, Native American, or Hispanic.
Growth linked to increasing numbers of inmates in prison for
violent and drug offenses </p>

<p> The distribution of the four major offense
categories--violent, property, drug, and public-order
offenses--changed dramatically in the Nation's prison population
between 1980 and 1993. As a percentage of all State and Federal
inmates, violent offenders fell from 57% in 1980 to 45% in 1993,
property offenders fell from 30% to 22%, drug offenders rose from
8% to 26%, and public-order offenders rose from 5% to 7%. </p>

<p> The rise in the number of drug offenders was the greatest
among Federal inmates. Prisoners sentenced for drug law
violations were the single largest group of Federal inmates (60%)
in 1993, up from 25% in 1980. The increase in drug offenders
accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total growth in
Federal inmates. </p>

<p> The percentage of inmates in State prison for a drug crime
also rose significantly, from 6% in 1980 to 22% in 1993. Nearly
10 times as many inmates were serving time in State prisons for
drug offenses in 1993 (186,000) as in 1980 (19,000). </p>

<p> In absolute numbers, however, the growth in State inmates was
greatest among violent offenders. Between 1980 and 1993, the
number of violent offenders grew by 221,200, while the number of
drug offenders grew by 167,000. As a percentage of the total
growth in sentenced State inmates during the period, violent
offenders accounted for 42% of the total growth, drug offenders
31%, property offenders 19%, and public-order offenders 7%. </p>

<p> Average sentence length and time served for State inmates
relatively unchanged </p>

<p> Data on prison admissions and releases collected annually in
the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) suggest that
growth in the State prison populations has not been the result of
longer sentences. (Each year participating States provide
information on sentencing and time served for persons entering or
leaving prison. In 1993, 38 States and the District of Columbia
submitted data, accounting for nearly 93% of all admissions and
85% of all releases nationwide during the year.) Between 1985 and
1992, years in which comparable data are available, the average
(mean) maximum sentences of prisoners actually declined from 78
months to 67 months. </p>

<p> The median sentence length (the 50th percentile) of prisoners
admitted from court remained constant at 48 months. Moreover,
despite the increasing use of mandatory minimums and sentencing
enhancements during the period, the percent of inmates who
received a maximum sentence of 10 years or longer actually
declined (from 19.7% in 1985 to 17.7% in 1992). </p>

<p> The NCRP data also reveal no significant changes in the time
served by offenders released from State prison during the period.
In 1992 State prisoners released for the first time on their
current offense (that is, first releases) served an average of 22
months in prison and 5 months in jail. (Time served in jail is
the amount of time an inmate spends in jail prior to entering
State prison and is credited towards time served on the total
sentence.) The amount of time served in prison was slightly lower
in 1985 (20 months), higher in 1986 (24 months), and about the
same since 1987 (22 months). </p>

<p> These data reflect the time served by prisoners actually
released. Some prisoners will never be released but will die in
prison. Some prisoners with very long sentences do not show up
among released prisoners for many years. As a result, measures of
time served based on released prisoners tend to understate the
actual time to be served by persons entering prison. </p>

<p> Changing Federal sentencing linked to population growth </p>

<p> The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 introduced &quot;truth in
sentencing&quot; to the Federal justice system. The Act created a
commission that specified sentencing guidelines, which went into
effect in late 1987. The guidelines took into account the gravity
of the crime and the offender's criminal record. Under the
guidelines offenders convicted of Federal offenses are expected
to serve a minimum of 85% of the actual sentence. </p>

<p> After 1986 the average Federal sentence to prison for violent
crimes decreased, while overall time served increased. The result
is a rapidly growing Federal prison population. After 1986 the
average time served by persons released from Federal prison rose
from 15 months to 24 months (a 60% increase). For violent
offenses, the time served by first releases increased from 50
months to 56 months and for drug offenses, time served increased
from 22 months to 33 months. </p>

<p> The sentencing reforms also increased the likelihood of
incarceration for convicted Federal offenders. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the number of defend-ants convicted in
U.S. district courts rose from 29,943 to 51,936, and the
percentage sent to prison increased from 46% to 75%. As a result,
the number of offenders sent to Federal prisons rose from 13,766
to 33,622--an increase of 144%. (&quot;Federal Criminal Case
Processing, 1980-90,&quot; September 1992, NCJ-136945;
&quot;Federal Criminal Case Processing, 1982-91, With Preliminary
Data for 1992,&quot; November 1993, NCJ-144526.) </p>

<p> Rise in State prison population the result of increasing
number of arrests and higher probabilities of incarceration </p>

<p> Underlying the growth in the State prison population has been
an increase in the number of arrests from nearly 8.3 million
adult arrests in 1980 to 11.6 million in 1993. Although the total
grew by nearly 41%, for some offenses the percent increase was
substantially greater: simple assault (139%), drug abuse
violations (116%), aggravated assault (86%). Compounding the
impact of more adult arrests for selected serious offenses, the
rate of sending offenders to prison rose between 1980 and 1992
(the latest year for which data are available). Except for murder
and nonnegligent manslaughter, the number of admissions to State
prison per 1,000 arrests for serious crimes rose significantly.
The likelihood of incarceration upon arrest increased 5-fold for
drug violations, increased 4-fold for weapons offenses, and
doubled for larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and sexual
assault other than rape. </p>

<p> As a result of the compounding nature of these factors, the
number of admissions to State prisons from court rose from
131,215 sentenced prisoners in 1980 to 318,069 in 1993, an
increase of 142%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> National Prisoner Statistics </p>

<p> This Bulletin is based on an advance count of prisoners
conducted for the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program
immediately after the end of each calendar year. A detailed,
final count containing any revisions to the jurisdictions'
advance count will be published later. </p>

<p> Most States provide jurisdiction counts, that is, the number
of inmates under their jurisdiction on December 31, regardless of
the location of their inmates. These counts exclude inmates
housed for other jurisdictions, such as other State's inmates and
pretrial detainees, that are housed in a jurisdiction's
facilities. </p>

<p> Some States provide custody counts, that is, the number of
inmates housed in State facilities regardless of jurisdiction.
(See Jurisdiction notes.) These counts exclude inmates housed
outside of each State's prison facilities, such as inmates housed
in local jails. Custody counts are used to calculate the total
number of inmates in prisons and jails. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> The offense distributions of State prisoners at yearend were
estimated for 1980, 1985, and 1990-93. To obtain estimates of the
custody populations by offense, data from inmate surveys
conducted in 1979, 1986, and 1991, were combined with counts by
offense of annual admissions and releases. The surveys provided
the basis for estimating the offense distributions of the other
years. </p>

<p> The offense distributions were estimating using forward and
backward stock-flow procedures as outlined in Correction
Populations in the United States, 1992 (January 1995,
NCJ-146413). Data from the 1979 survey were used for forward
estimates for 1980; data from the 1986 survey (conducted in March
1986) were used for 1985 estimates, 1990 forward estimates, and
1980 backward estimates; and data from the 1991 survey for 1991
estimates and 1992-93 forward estimates. </p>

<p> To obtain flow populations for each year, the offense
distributions of admissions and releases were drawn from annual
reports of the National Prisoner Statistics (1980-82) program and
the National Corrections Reporting Program (1983-92). Data from
the 1992 NCRP were used to estimate flows for 1993. </p>

<p> The offense distributions of Federal inmates are for
prisoners of any sentence length on September 30 in 1980 and
1985. Data for 1990-93 are taken from the BJS Federal justice
database. </p>
