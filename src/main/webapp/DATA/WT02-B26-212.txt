<B>Problem/Opportunity </B>
<P>
Colonies of bacteria often create leaks in steel pipes that carry natural gas and many other products.  In pipeline systems where water collects, bacterial colonies can form deposits on metal surfaces and produce organic acids that accelerate corrosion and cause localized pitting.  The bacteria act as environmental "catalysts," creating corrosion under conditions that cannot be reproduced in the laboratory.  Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) in the natural gas industry has been estimated to cause 15-30% of corrosion-related pipeline failures.  Improved MIC detection systems would provide early warning of pipeline failures and help avert worker injuries.  
<P>
In the United States, industries spend $1.2 billion annually on biocidal chemicals to fight MIC.  These treatments are not only costly, but they can also have a harmful environmental effect.  As regulatory scrutiny of biocides intensifies, these chemicals represent potential environmental liabilities to industry.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory is developing the next generation of mitigation approaches, which are intended to reduce dependence on toxic chemical treatment.  To field test candidate technologies, Argonne established a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas).  The next generation of approaches being developed and tested includes inexpensive carbon steels that resist MIC, "alternative" biocides that are less toxic than those now in use, and improved on-line MIC detection methods.

Argonne and SoCal Gas have both set up experimental test loop systems to study the prevention and monitoring of MIC.  Both systems use produced water from natural gas storage or production fields.  The test loop systems are being used for: 
<UL>
<LI>Screening and development of inexpensive MIC-resistant carbon steels,
<LI>Development of less toxic chemical treatments, and
<LI>Calibration and testing of on-line MIC detection methods and proprietary treatment approaches.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
SoCal Gas tests promising candidate metallurgies, treatments, and detection methods in the test loop system at its Montebello (California) natural gas storage field.  In addition to providing technical support for these field tests, Argonne uses its own laboratory test loop system to develop the information needed to improve the application or design of these technologies.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne and SoCal Gas are currently field testing alternative chemical treatments in gas storage and recovery wells, which traditionally have been most susceptible to MIC.  At SoCal Gas's Montebello storage field, these treatment efforts are saving an estimated $1 million/year.  In addition, two on-line devices have been selected as candidates for MIC-specific monitoring.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Further reduction in chemical usage will require an even better understanding of corrosion mechanisms.  In its laboratory test loop, Argonne will correlate localized corrosion with a specific electrochemical signal.
<P>
In addition, chemical companies and a steel tubing manufacturer are joining the CRADA to examine methods of using less toxic chemicals to prevent MIC and to examine the effects of metallurgy on susceptibility to MIC.
