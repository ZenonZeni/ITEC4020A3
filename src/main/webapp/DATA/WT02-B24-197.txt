<H3><CENTER><A NAME=success>Surrogacy: The Quiet Success Story</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>As surrogacy enters its second decade of practice in the United States,
an important fact is becoming increasingly clear: surrogate parenting is
an extraordinarily successful human endeavor.
<P>The sensational publicity surrounding a handful of surrogacy cases ("Baby
M" in particular) should not overshadow the fact that there have been an
estimated 1,500 successful surrogate births. A professional program that
matches infertile couples with carefully screened and counseled surrogate
mothers is newsworthy only to the participants. Understandably, media ignores
the quiet, consistent successes in favor of sensational controversy.
<P>The application of advanced reproductive technologies such as IVF, GIFT,
ZIFT and embryo freezing to the field of surrogacy is new opportunities for
childless couples who have refused to give up the dream of someday having
a family.
<P>It is perhaps the American spirit of never saying never nor accepting
a situation as hopeless which is responsible for keeping the United States
at the forefront of applied reproductive technology.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=ftc>Federal Trade Commission Role in Protection of IVF
Consumer</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>We have recently had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Michael Katz,
Supervisory Investigator with the Division of Service Industry Practices
for the Federal Trade Commission.
<P>The recent proliferation of IVF clinics, including some that are suspected
of making deceptive claims, has prompted action by the FTC. Mr. Katz reports
that there are approximately 200 clinics in the United States, a 25% increase
over 1987. Thus far, the FTC has asked 25 of them to substantiate and clarify
their publicized "success rates." For example, the FTC has asked clinics
to differentiate between chemical pregnancies, clinical pregnancies, and
the "take home baby rate."
<P>We are impressed with the FTC's involvement in the policing of fraud against
infertile couples. Their monitoring of the IVF community is of great potential
benefit to the infertile couple. Besides taking legal action and imposing
penalties for fraud, the FTC hopes to eventually provide a consumer guide
to assist patients in choosing IVF clinics and understanding their statistics.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=zift>World's First ZIFT Birth</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>An important milestone was reached in May of this year with the birth
of a healthy baby boy conceived by ZIFT (Zygote IntraFallopian Transfer),
an innovative procedure. This major event occurred at the Hospital of the
Good Samaritan in Los Angeles under the direction of Dr. Richard Marrs, working
in conjunction with our Center.
<P>In the ZIFT process, the infertile couple produces their own embryos through
in vitro fertilization. By means of a laparoscopy, the newly fertilized embryos
(rather than simply the sperm and egg as is done in GIFT) are placed into
the fallopian tubes of a surrogate gestational mother, whose cycle has been
synchronized with the donor mother's cycle.
<P>The Center provided the professional components for all parties involved
in this technological miracle, including selecting and screening the surrogate
mother, as well as coordination of all legal, psychological and medical aspects
of the surrogate process.

</H3><H4><CENTER>Frequently Asked Questions About Surrogate Parenting</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<H4>Q. What motivates a woman to become a surrogate mother?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>According to studies conducted by psychologist
<A HREF=Hillbio.html>Dr. Hilary Hanafin</A>, a recognized authority on surrogacy
and adoption who has interviewed over 500 surrogate mother candidates in
the last six years, major motivations are: enjoyment of the pregnant state
and the desire to be pregnant again. These women uniformly describe their
previous pregnancies as relatively easy. Being pregnant provides an opportunity
to feel special and to experience a sense of wholeness. They also have empathy
for childless couples, an empathy increased by prior contact with an infertile
couple's pain and by the importance of children in their own lives. A third
reason was the desire to do something remarkable with their lives and to
make a unique contribution. Many perceive being a surrogate as providing
a sense of accomplishment. Financial gain is not the primary factor.
<H4>Q. What is the legal status of surrogate parenting in the U. S.?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>Surrogate parenting has become a states' issue, with individual
states differing in their legal approach to surrogacy. Florida makes it illegal
to pay a surrogate anything other than expenses. Louisiana, Michigan, and
New Jersey have declared surrogate contracts unenforceable, while states
such as Nevada and Arkansas have declared surrogacy legal and contracts
specifically enforceable. The majority of states, including California, have
yet to pass laws on surrogacy. However, surrogacy continues to flourish here,
with the complete cooperation of the courts, and the state Department of
Adoptions.
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting welcomes questions regarding any aspect
of the surrogate parenting process.

</H3><H4><CENTER>A personal story from a couple experiencing the IVF/HOST
surrogate process.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>It was sunny and I was able to sit out on our deck while I waited nervously
for the phone call from California. Maureen, the nurse coordinator from the
IVF team would be calling with the results of the pregnancy test. When the
phone finally rang, I was so nervous that I found it hard to breathe as I
answered. Would the miracles of modern science allow us nature's miracle:
a child'?
<P>My husband and I began this journey in 1981, little knowing how difficult
and emotionally draining it would be. Like all parent-hopefuls, we were very
optimistic about conceiving in short order. Three, six, twelve months- and
pages of temperature charts later- my period kept coming with painful regularity.
<P>Over time, five top-notch fertility specialists examined, counseled, operated
on and treated me. No one had an explanation, just the label "idiopathic
infertility." Under various doctors' directions, I tried treatments almost
randomly. Drugs first; clomid to stimulate ovulation, progesterone to beef
up endometrium, and parlodel, which sometimes is effective in cases of
unexplained infertility. Next we tried artificial insemination several times
a month for four months. I joined the waiting list for our local in vitro
fertilization program (IVF) which had just been opened up to "unexplained"
infertility patients.
<P>Every month that went by was agony. I wanted a baby. I needed a baby.
If nothing else, I had to know that someday there would be a baby. We signed
up with the government's adoption program but the waiting period was projected
to be four to five years and, because of an age limit, it was unlikely that,
in the end, we would be permitted to adopt a child.
<P>Some couples say they will only go through IVF once - the emotional and
financial consequences of failure are too painful. It didn't work for us
that first time in June, 1985. But I was determined to persevere. Feeling
that I absolutely had to keep trying has carried me through more surgical
protocols than I care to add up. Once, twice, three more times with no success.
<P>I think we first heard about surrogates in 1985 and kept the idea in the
back of our minds. With our IVF experience, and knowing that we could produce
apparently viable embryos, we contemplated how marvelous it might be to conceive
a child of our own and have the embryo carried by a surrogate mother. When
the news broke about an Ohio medical team having done this, we were thrilled.
If our attempts continued to fail, there might still be a way for us to have
our own child.
<P>I feel very lucky when I consider the dramatic changes in options for
infertile couples that have arisen in the past ten years. Bless the researchers
who were brave enough to extend IVF studies from animals to humans. And bless
the medical teams who were brave enough to extend the technology of embryo
transfer to surrogate mothers.
<P>After another failed IVF attempt in July, 1987, we felt that it was time
to earnestly pursue surrogacy. We joined a comprehensive program at the Center
for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills, California. We were matched with
four possible surrogates before biology cooperated enough to give us a shot
at a successful IVF attempt. Toward these four women I feel a strange mixture
of gratitude and awe; they can get pregnant! They have easy pregnancies.
They want to help me! They are willing to go through all the trials and
tribulations of pregnancy and birth so that I, too, can be a mother.
<P>After having had eggs retrieved surgically seven times and completing
five embryo transfer procedures, I was willing to try one last time. But
this time, I was counting on the miracle of someone else's body to make it
all worthwhile. The day before the results came back, I hit rock bottom.
I was sure it hadn't worked, and my emotional turmoil was so great that,
for the first time, I vowed I would not do it again. I experienced a brief
period of emotional limbo when the results of the first blood test showed
low levels of HCG (the pregnancy hormone). There was a chance that it had
worked! False hopes; it had been a transient, terminated pregnancy. The medical
world has a name for it "chemical pregnancy." Only in the world of infertility
can this be considered "progress."
<P>Despite vowing "never again," my emotional strength did rebound, or rather
stubbornness and resigned determination carried the day. There would be ONE
more time.
<P>I needed to try that one more time as soon as possible. With a somewhat
greater degree of medical intervention, we were able to try to simultaneously
achieve pregnancies with two new surrogates in June. Both tried so hard to
make it work for us. Again, the day before the results were due, I was both
paralyzed with fear and overcome with gratitude that someone else - a surrogate
- was trying to share my emotional burden and help me try to become a mother.
<P>Just as I answered the phone, my husband arrived home to provide moral
support. Walking towards the deck, he saw me talking on the phone with Maureen,
tears pouring down my cheeks. He didn't say a word as he came towards me,
feeling that inexpressible wave of crushing disappointment once again. I
finally managed to sob out Maureen's first words to me: "Do you have any
champagne?". His tears came as fast and furiously as had mine. With those
words, an emotional burden built on six long years of agony, frustration
and tears began to lift. We are finally expecting a child.

<H4><A HREF=EggD.html>Egg Donor Program</A>
</H4><P>The Center is pleased to announce the first twin egg donor pregnancy
under its new comprehensive Egg Donor Program. The program allows women who
cannot produce viable eggs, but can carry a pregnancy, to utilize donor eggs
for in vitro fertilization. Since the recipient mother gives birth, she is
considered the legal and natural mother of the child.
<P>
<H4>Unique Reproductive Center
</H4><P>The Huntington Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California is one
of the few facilities worldwide which combine full-time female and male
infertility specialists in a comprehensive program. The team approach of
Drs. Paulo Serafini, Joel Batzofin, William Blank and Gary Hubert combines
their expertise in IVF/ET, GIFT, ZIFT, IUI, and EARS (electrically assisted
recovery of sperm) to help a reported 44% of all their patients take home
a child.
<P>
<H4>Long Distance IVF Surrogacy
</H4><P>Dr. Jirair Konialian of Granada Hills, California has achieved a
viable pregnancy with an infertile British couple and an IVF/Host surrogate
mother in the Center's program. Working in conjunction with Century City
Hospital in Los Angeles, Dr. Konialian coordinated the synchronization of
both women's cycles via FAX, letter and telephone. The entire process, including
the aspiration of eggs, was filmed as part of a British documentary series,
"The Human Factor," scheduled to air this Fall.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=cotton>First British Surrogate Mother Investigates Surrogacy
in the U. S.</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Kim Cotton Visits the Center for Surrogate Parenting</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Kim Cotton, Britain's first financially compensated surrogate mother who
was the focus of British media attention in 1985, spent a week this summer
at the Center recounting her experiences as a surrogate and learning about
the Center's protocols, safeguards and group support approach to surrogacy.
<P>Both professional surrogacy and private adoption are illegal in Britain.
With the help of Gena Dodd, who herself had a surrogate-born son, Kim founded
COTS (Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy), a volunteer organization
which helps put infertile couples and potential surrogate mothers in contact
with each other, as well as providing a psychological support system for
surrogates currently pregnant. They are in their second year of operation
and have 165 members, hold an annual General Meeting, and publish a quarterly
newsletter. Mrs. Cotton frequently lectures on surrogacy at universities
and has provided testimony for various ethical committees, including the
British Medical Association (who have yet to report).
<P>Upon her return to England, Kim Cotton reported in the latest COTS newsletter,
"The Center for Surrogate Parenting in California is, in my opinion, surrogacy
run to absolute perfection... It is regarding the surrogate mothers where
the agency really shines ... she is closely monitored and supported throughout
the whole procedure... You will never meet a girl until she has passed the
medical and the psychological screening ... I sat through a surrogate interview
with her husband and child present. I compared notes with Hilary Hanafin
(the Center's psychologist) afterwards ... I thought she was ideal, but Dr.
Hanafin had reservations ... The chances are extremely high that you will
bring home a child of your own without difficulty and with the knowledge
your surrogate will be looked after, long after you have gone home ... To
sum it up, if you want Host/IVF surrogacy, definitely go to Los Angeles -
if you want AI surrogacy (artificial insemination), again definitely L.A.!

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=frozen>Medical First: Surrogate Mother Pregnant with
Frozen Embryo</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The world's first frozen embryo pregnancy with a surrogate mother was
achieved at our Center this June, working in conjunction with Dr. Richard
Marrs at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles.
<P>This medical first marks the beginning of the Center's Frozen Embryo Program,
whereby infertile couples who are able to create embryos may retrieve them
at their own IVF clinics and subsequently ship the frozen embryos to Los
Angeles for implantation into host uteri. In other cases, it may be appropriate
for the surrogate to travel to the prospective parents' home town for the
implantation.
<P>For couples living a great distance from southern California, the Frozen
Embryo Program offers the opportunity to create a genetically related child
without the cost and time expenditures of previous methodologies.

<P>The following is excerpted from a keynote address presented at the VI
World Congress on IVF, Jerusalem, Israel; April 6, 1989. The medical procedures
reported were conducted by: Jirair Konialian, M. D., Century City Hospital,
Los Angeles, CA; Jaroslav Marik, M.D., Beverly Hills Medical Center, Beverly
Hills, CA; Richard Marrs, M.D., Hospital of the Good Samaritan, Los Angeles,
CA.
<P>The Sample
<P>The sample consisted of twenty-two infertile couples who came to the Center
for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills, California. All participants in
this sample had comprehensive medical and psychological screening and counseling,
as well as full medical and legal informed consent.
<P>The Results
<P>The pregnancy rate for this sample group is 32% per transfer. The "take
home baby" rate is 25.8%. Overall, of the 22 couples attempting to end their
childlessness, thus far eight of them will take home a baby, resulting in
a 27.5%, success rate for the couples in the sample.
