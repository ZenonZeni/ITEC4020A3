<H2>Local economic analysis - the need</H2>
<P>Many policy advisors and business planners require economic information and
analysis at a local level, rather than at a regional or national level. In a
single European market, what happens in the local economy is increasingly
subject to national and international trends, but the way in which each local
area responds to these trends depends on its particular features. Whether
developing a strategy for a local area, evaluating the impact of regional
policy, or assessing the prospects for future growth in incomes and employment,
analysts need to combine an understanding of global trends with knowledge of the
local area.</P>
<P>But economic analysis at the local level has often not met the users' needs
adequately.</P>
<P>There is a need to draw on national and regional data to supplement limited
local information. This uses substantial resources, and may be carried out in an
<I>ad hoc</I> way that is difficult to reproduce later.</P>
<P>The scale of the task may require the use of external consultants. This can
leave in-house staff without the knowledge needed to interpret or update the
analysis.</P>
<P>The link between developments in the national and international economy and
the local areas is seldom made formal. But the result can be that these trends
are not quantified and so their significance is impossible to gauge.</P>
<P>There is no tool to develop scenarios of what might happen under different
assumptions. But evaluation requires an assessment of what would have happened
if the policy has not been implemented.</P>
<H2>LEFM - a tool for local economic analysis and projections</H2>
<P>LEFM is a friendly PC-based tool for local economic analysis and
projections. It draws on Cambridge Econometrics' expertise in macroeconomic,
sectoral and regional analysis across Europe. Users receive a tailored version
of LEFM, with a base forecast calibrated to local conditions, but they can also
develop their own scenarios. Comparison with national projections is made
available, in order to put the local results in context.</P>
<P><B>LEFM provides</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>an efficient means of generating local projections</LI>
<LI>easy updating, allowing the user to  draw on and reassess previous analysis</LI>
<LI>sectoral detail, so that projections can be identified with major local
enterprises</LI>
<LI>a systematic, rigorous and transparent method, so that results can easily
be traced back to assumptions</LI>
<LI>easy links to regularly updated, authoritative forecasts at the European
and national level</LI>
<LI>a tool for constructing scenarios, examining the local impact of inward
investment, plant closures, and regional policy</LI></UL>
