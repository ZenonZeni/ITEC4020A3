<P>You may be able to find some information that will help in evaluating a test in a book in your university library. For evaluating the test itself, you will need to buy a copy. Test publishers as a group have decided not to offer free copies for evaulation purposes. Moreover, you are expected to treat the evaluation copy you purchase in accordance with the <A HREF="Policies.html">proper procedures for handling tests</A>, even though you are asked to pay for the evaluation copy. People who are new to testing sometimes have a problem with the expected standard of behavior for test users. However, if you view these <A HREF="WhatAreR.html">standards</A> from the perspective of the test publisher and the other users of these tests, they will come to make sense.
<P>Most test publishers allow for the purchase of a single copy of a test and/or manual for evaluation. That is, normally you do not have to buy 25 copies of a test just to look it over. Whenever you see an item entitled <EM>examination kit</EM> or <EM>specimen set</EM> it will usually contain a sample copy of the printed test forms and a manual (though usually not a scoring key). Sometimes it will be possible to purchase a test manual (which may have a copy of the test reproduced in an appendix). This at least will allow you to determine if you want to go to the expense of purchasing a kit which provides all the materials necessary for several administrations. Specimen sets are sold for evaluation purposes. Once you have received them, <U><EM>you may not</EM></U> return them for a refund.
<P>The test publishing industry does not function as a library system. Nor does it support the<EM> gratis</EM> promotional system common in book publishing. Free copies of tests are almost never given to people for promotional  purposes.
<P>Most publishers will not reduce the rate at which <A HREF="WhatCopy.html">copyrighted</A> test
 materials are sold to researchers. If a special edition of a test needs to be printed, such arrangements can only be negotiated directly with the publisher. Typically rights to reproduce tests are not granted at all, or if they are granted require the purchaser to pay all costs of printing up their own copies, plus 60% of the regular edition selling price (as a royalty).
