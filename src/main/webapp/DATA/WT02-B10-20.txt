Dysfunction Claim</b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

Bureau of Veterinary Drugs</b></font></p>
<p>OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, June 10, 1996 -- Deprenyl Animal
Health, Inc. (NASD OTC Bulletin Board: DAHI; Toronto Stock
Exchange: DAH) has filed a Supplemental New Drug Submission with
Canada's Health Protection Branch, Bureau of Veterinary Drugs,
for approval to market Anipryl&#174; (l-selegiline) for treating
cognitive dysfunction, an Alzheimer's-like disease in geriatric
dogs. Canine cognitive dysfunction shares certain
neuro-pathologic lesions with early-stage Alzheimer's disease in
people. </p>
<p>If approved, this will mark the second label indication for
Anipryl&#174;. </p>
<p>Approximately 150,000 cases of cognitive dysfunction occur in
Canada each year. It is a progressive, ultimately fatal disease
characterized by various behavior problems such as loss of house
training, inability to recognize familiar people and places,
tremors, and changes in sleep/wake patterns. Commonly referred to
as senility or old dog syndrome, pet owners are often reluctantly
forced to euthanize their companion animals afflicted with
cognitive dysfunction. </p>
<p>Following one month of Anipryl&#174; therapy, 75 percent of
dogs treated with Anipryl&#174; exhibited statistically
significant behavioral improvement, according to the final report
of the 93-patient clinical trial that was included as part of the
supplemental new drug submission. The improvement for the trial
population was maintained following two and three months </p>
<p>of Anipryl&#174; therapy. The proposed initial dosage of
Anipryl&#174; to treat cognitive dysfunction is 0.5mg per
kilogram of body weight, which could be increased to a maximum of
1mg per kilogram. </p>
<p>Anipryl&#174; is marketed in Canada by DRAXIS Health Inc.
(NASDAQ: DRAXF; TSE: DAX) to treat canine Cushing's disease.
There are approximately 15,000 cases of canine Cushing's disease
diagnosed in Canada each year. The approved initial dosage for
canine Cushing's is 1mg/kilogram, which could be increased to a
maximum 2mg/kilogram. </p>
<p>The company is awaiting action from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug
Administration on its canine Cushing's disease application, which
was submitted in September 1995. </p>
<p>The company expects to complete its U.S. Phase-III equivalent
clinical trial for cognitive dysfunction this year, and submit a
file seeking approval for that indication during the early part
of 1997. More than 1.5 million cases of canine cognitive
dysfunction occur in the U.S. annually. </p>
<p>DRAXIS Health currently owns 44 percent of the common stock of
DAHI, and its ownership could increase to as much as 52 percent
through the conversion of outstanding loans issued to DAHI. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health was established in 1990 to develop
animal health applications for Anipryl&#174;. The Company is also
identifying other animal health product opportunities to become a
multi-product animal health pharmaceutical company. </p>
