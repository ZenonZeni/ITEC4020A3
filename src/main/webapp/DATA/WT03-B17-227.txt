<PRE>
  1...raised beds allow you to grow from 4 to 7 times more food in  the
     same area then in the same ground.

  2..raised  beds allow you greater control over watering cost,s  pests
     (from  gophers  to ants), and crops (especially extending  harvest
     periods).

  3..raised beds allow you greater control of the soil being used.

     Raised Beds are easy to make and you can recycle (re-use)  various
materials   in  making  the beds. You can use rocks,  wood  (untreated,
unpainted of course), tree logs, bricks.  You can use bottles  to  make
the  sides of your raised beds. Stick upside  down in ground.  You  can
use  clay on the inside to mold and hold them together or you  can  use
sand  and pack it in or use rope to tie them together. The idea  has  a
lot  of potential for re-using glass around the home. Untreated Redwood
makes good wood for raised beds. A good size for a raised bed is 10  ft
long  by 5 ft wide by 12 inches tall by 2 in thick.  This size  is  big
enough  to feed a family of 4.  Pine, fir and almost any kind of strong
wood  is all right as long as it is untreated. Never use Rail Road ties
that  have  been treated. This is very bad for your health as  well  as
being bad for the garden (it kills the soil).
