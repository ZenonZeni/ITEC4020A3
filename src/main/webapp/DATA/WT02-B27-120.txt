<h2><A HREF="MAILTO:didmsnj@easynet.co.uk"><img src="mailbox.gif"></a> &nbsp Hi there!</h2>

<P><B>Your feedback is very valuable</B> - whether it's about the issues covered, depth of coverage, things you'd like to see on these pages, or on the technical side if you've noticed bugs, have problems accessing anything, or notice any errors. Perhaps you've seen some links that could be usefully added? Were your looking for something in particular and couldn't find it? let me know! You will not only be helping me but helping others who will use this site.

<P>The VESS webpages are continuing to expand. I'm very much a newbie at this, having literally had to learn enough to get by on with HTML programming language overnight. So *all* constructive comments and suggestions, are *very* welcome.
The pages are very much at the designer stage, so any features or reference material you would find useful please let me know now. It won't be perfect - I'm doing this on top of a 60-hr a week job - but it's certainly interesting and feedback from you - small or large - helps considerably.

<P>I currently test these pages on Netscape 2.0n only, but I try to bear in mind you may be using a different browser. If there's material you're missing out on because of your browser limitations, please let me know and I will try to put it right.

<P>Again, please do try to send feedback. I will try to acknowledge/reply to all emails. It helps if you can tell me for instance:
<BR><BR>
<li>which section(s) did you found most interesting or useful?
<li>which sections did you found dull or boring?
<li>Do you find the <strong>content</strong> of the pages Very Poor? Poor? Average? Good? Very Good?
<li>Do you find the <strong>design</strong> of the pages Very Poor? Poor? Average? Good? Very Good?
<li>Do you find the <strong>overall quality</strong> of the pages Very Poor? Poor? Average? Good? Very Good?
<li>what type of browser are you using?
<li>Did you browse these pages for pleasure? lay interest? professional interest?
<li>Is there a particular aspect that is of most interest to you? Eg Law? Ethics? Medicine?
<li>Which section did you find the best? the worst?
<li>Is there any particular information that you were looking for that you were <strong>unable</strong> to find?
<li>Any other comments or suggestions?
<P>All best wishes 

<P>Chris Docker
