<h1 align =center><i>P.K.'s Story</i></h1><hr>

 I am a 39 year old with secondary infertility. I had been experiencing moderate pain (Lower Lumbar and pelvic with some radiation down my right leg). In addition to the bouts of cyclical loose stools I was having feelings of considerable rectal pressure. There was also some bladder symptoms. - in particular pain on emptying a full bladder.  Unrelated to the endometriosis, (I believe), I have had heavy bleeding during my periods. <p>
A diagnostic laparoscopy was done as part of my infertility workup in February. It revealed a large cyst 4.5 x 5 x 3.5cm on the left ovary. The cyst, thought to be an endometrioma, had also caught the tube under the ovary. <p><img align=right src="pat1.gif">

The lap also revealed stage 3 endometriosis, some of which was lasered at that time. The cyst ruptured when the ovary was pulled up. The contents were not typical of endometrioma. It was thinner consistency, port-wine colored. It was not removed at that time. <p>

In the following two months I had an upper and lower GI which were negative for bowel implants, a CA 125 test result of 47(elevated), and an ultrasound that confirmed that the cyst was not changing in size. <p>On May 19, I had my second lap. At the beginning of the surgery my doctor found bi-lateral endometriomas. The second is the left ovary opened after dissection of the cyst. The fourth shows a chocolate cyst found on the back of the right ovary. The left ovarian cyst was attached to the bladder,-tube and rested on a portion of bowel (sigmoid colon). This may have been the cause of my diarrhea. <img 
align=left src="pat2.gif"><p> The right cyst was attached to the pelvic wall and had tube involvement. Both cysts were removed at the time of surgery.<p>
My OB recommends a course of Lupron.  After that I will try and conceive.  She suggested we might consider using Humegon or Pergonal and insemination to improve our odds before the endometrioisis recurs. But we feel my biologic clock is clicking and want to consider IVF.  <p>Before getting starting, she wants to recheck my husbands sperm count and make sure my <i>day 3 FSH</i> is ok after completing the Lupron.  Because of my age and ovarian surgery, the ovarian reserve may be diminished and we might want to consider using donor eggs.<h2> Wish us luck!</h2><hr><p>
