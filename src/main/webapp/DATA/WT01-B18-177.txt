<title> Energy-Efficient Building Design</title>
<table><tr><td><blockquote>


<H3>1. Energy-Efficient Building Design Can Significantly Improve Worker 
Productivity</H3>
<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>Numerous examples demonstrate that energy-efficient building and 
office design can significantly increase worker productivity. By improving 
lighting, heating, and cooling, workers can be made more comfortable and 
productive. An increase of 1 percent in p<BR>
roductivity can provide savings to a company that exceed its entire energy 
bill.<a href="#146" name="r146"> [ 146 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="LockheedMissilesandSpaceCompany">Lockheed Missiles and Space Company<a>.</B></I> One of the 
most successful examples of efficient office-building design is Lockheed 
Missiles and Space Company's Building 157 in Sunnyvale, California.<a href="#147" name="r147"> [ 147 ] </a>The 
600,000 square-foot office building, designed by the architectural firm 
Leo A. Daly, brings daylight deep into the building. A central atrium runs 
top to bottom; the building's 2,700 engineers and support staff consider 
it the building's most attractive feature. Exterior "light shelves" on the 
south facade operate as sunshades or as reflectors depending on the 
season; in summer, they bounce light onto the interior ceiling to maximize 
interior light, while in the winter, when the sun's angle is lower, they 
diffuse reflected light and reduce glare. The overall design separates 
ambient and task lighting, with daylight supplying most of the ambient 
lighting and task lighting fixtures supplementing each workstation. 
Continuously dimmable fluorescents with photocell sensors maintain a 
constant level of light automatically and save even more energy. The open 
office layout was designed to foster the interaction, and the comfort, of 
the engineers and staff. Employees rave about the building.<BR>
<p>    <p>      Daylighting has saved Lockheed about 75 percent on its lighting 
bill. Since daylight generates less heat than office lights, the design 
features cut peak air-conditioning substantially. Overall, the building 
runs with about half the energy costs of a typical building of similar 
size. Although the energy-efficient improvements added roughly $2 million 
to the building's $50 million capital costs, the energy savings are worth 
nearly $500,000 per year, and paid for themselves in a little more than 
four years.<BR>
<p>    <p>      More important, however, have been productivity improvements. 
Russell Robinson, manager of facility interior development, reports that 
productivity is up while absenteeism is down. Lockheed considers 
productivity data to be proprietary, but according to Don Aitken, chairman 
of the Department of Environmental Studies at nearby San Jose State 
University, "Lockheed moved a known population of workers into the 
building and absenteeism dropped 15 percent." Aitken led numerous tours of 
Building 157 after it opened, and was told by Lockheed officials that the 
reduced absenteeism paid 100 percent of the extra cost of the building in 
the first year. The architect, Lee Windheim, reports that Lockheed 
officials told him that productivity rose 15 percent on the first major 
contract done in the building. Apparently, top Lockheed officials told 
Aitken that they believe they won a very competitive $1.5 billion defense 
contract on the basis of their improved productivity - and that the 
profits from that contract alone paid for the entire building.<a href="#148" name="r148"> [ 148 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="WestBendMutualInsuranceCompany">West Bend Mutual Insurance Company<a>.</B></I> Another 
example of improved productivity through energy-efficient design involves 
West Bend Mutual Insurance Company's new 150,000-square-foot headquarters 
in West Bend, Wisconsin. The building is the subject of one of the most 
carefully documented increases in productivity due to green design.<a href="#149" name="r149"> [ 149 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      The building incorporates a number of energy-saving design 
features, including an energy-efficient lighting system (including task 
lighting and occupancy sensors), efficient windows, shell insulation, and 
a more efficient heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. 
It uses a thermal-storage system that makes ice overnight to help cool the 
building during the day. Offices all have individual temperature and 
airflow controls. Perhaps the most innovative feature of the building is 
its "environmentally responsive workstations" (ERWs). Workers in 
open-office areas are given direct, individual control over temperature 
and airflow via radiant heaters and vents built directly into their 
furniture and controlled by a panel on their desks. The control panel also 
provides direct control of task lighting and white-noise levels. A motion 
sensor in each workstation turns the station off when the worker leaves 
the space and turns it back on when he or she returns.<BR>
<p>    <p>      West Bend Mutual Insurance's old building had used $2.16 of 
annual electricity costs per square foot. The annual electricity costs in 
the new building are $1.32 per square foot - a 39 percent reduction. 
Furthermore, the <A NAME="RensselaerPolytechnicInstitute">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute<a> (RPI) in Troy, New York 
conducted a detailed study of productivity in the old building in the 26 
weeks before the move and in the new building for 24 weeks after the move. 
The conclusion of the RPI study: "The combined effect of the new building 
and ERWs produced a statistically significant median increase in 
productivity of approximately 16 percent over productivity in the old 
building."<a href="#150" name="r150"> [ 150 ] </a>Although a significant portion of the productivity increase 
derived from the ERWs, analysis shows that the majority of the 
productivity increase came from the building's energy-efficient design and 
systems.1<a href="#151" name="r151"> [ 151 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart<a>. </B></I>Wal-Mart's prototype "Eco-Mart" in 
Lawrence, Kansas incorporates several energy-efficient design features 
that have produced several interesting surprises for Wal-Mart management. 
Although the Eco-Mart design includes a glass arch at the entrance for 
daylighting, an efficient lighting system, an HVAC system that utilizes 
ice-storage, and special light-monitoring skylights, it includes a design 
flaw: only half the store is daylit. Interestingly, departments located in 
the daylit half of the store are considerably more productive. Sales in 
the daylit areas are higher than any other department in the Eco-Mart. 
They are also significantly higher than the same departments in other 
Wal-Mart stores. Wal-Mart is implementing many of the Eco-Mart measures in 
new construction for other stores and is retrofitting already-built stores 
with various energy-efficiency measures.<a href="#152" name="r152"> [ 152 ] </a>
