Established in 1981, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) is the national trade association for 
the domestic ethanol industry.  The RFA is dedicated toward the establishment of a strong 
marketplace for renewable fuels, increased consumer awareness and acceptance of alternative 
fuel sources, communication of sound technical industry data, and substantial industry growth
for ethanol, ETBE and other renewable fuels in the U.S. marketplace.  Membership includes
ethanol producers, fuel retailers, ethanol fuel blenders, equipment manufacturers, farm 
organizations, energy and engineering companies, and consumer organizations.<br>
<br>
The RFA promotes a visible and competitive domestic renewable fuels industry by aggressively
pursuing the following objectives:
<ul>
<li>To promote policies, programs and initiatives advantageous to the development and 
use of ethanol fuels to the U.S. Congress and other federal, state and local government 
entities.
<li>To provide technically accurate and up-to-date information on ethanol blended fuels to 
consumers, environmentalists, gasoline marketers, auto manufacturers and technicians.
<li>To distribute accurate information and to correct misinformation about ethanol to the media.
<li>To participate in educational activities to increase public awareness concerning the 
production, distribution and use of renewable fuels and the contribution that they can make 
to America's energy independence and the enhancement of national security.
