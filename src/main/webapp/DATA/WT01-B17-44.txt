</CENTER></H3>

<P>     James Duke, PhD, scientist at the USDAs Agricultural Research Service in
Beltsville, Maryland, studied the naturally-occurring plant chemicals in many of the
herbs and spices used for tea.  Following are Duke's recommendations for special
applications: 
<UL>
<A NAME="Stress">       </A><LI>Stress-Chamomile tea contains twelve calming and soothing compounds to soothe frazzled nerves.
<A NAME="Stomach">      </A><LI>Upset Stomach-Spearmint and peppermint are excellent aids to digestion.
<A NAME="Menst"> </A>   <LI>Menstrual Cramps-Red raspberry tea relaxes muscles.
        <LI>Insomnia-Lemongrass or lavender is mildly sedating.
        <LI>Toxic Environment-Rosehips contain vitamin C, an important antioxidant.

that has not reached boiling temperature yet is hot enough for steeping.  If water
has boiled, allow to cool a bit before steeping. Consuming very hot liquids is not
in your best health interest anyway, as there is a tie-in with  with esophageal 
cancer.</I>

Chlorella is an algae that is rich in chlorophyll, minerals, vitamins, and other 
        highly nutritious substances.  It regulates cholesterol, has antitumor and
antiviral properties, and can stimulate the immune system.  Chlorella is also a good
source of protein. Studies show that the chlorophyll found in chlorella can reduce
and even cure acute infections of the upper respiratory tract and sinuses. It also
helps to protect against radiation exposure.

     PRODUCE COUNTER</CENTER></H3>

Beta-carotene is now a household word we are familiar with its
cancer-preventive qualities. Scientists are starting to find that other members of
the carotenoid family may have  similar beneficial effects. Those identified
tomatoes, red peppers, oranges, broccoli, and kale are found to be deficient in many
people with cancer.

     CHINESE RESTAURANT</CENTER></H3>

Order extra steamed vegetables, mix them with your entree, and take half
home for the next day.
Eat out of your rice bowl. Use fork or chopsticks to
lift food from the fatty sauce. 
Choose vegetables, seafood, or poultry rather
than beef or pork.

We have learned from the Japanese that soy-based diets are protective against
heart disease. Here are some tips for adding tofu to everyday foods:
<UL>
        <LI>Marinate and grill tofu just as you would chicken or beef.  Serve in fajitas 
        or on top of salads.
        <LI>Stir-fry chunks of tofu with vegetables and serve over brown rice.
        <LI>Prepare your favorite chili recipe, substituting crumbled tofu for ground meat.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>CHOOSING FROZEN BREAKFASTS</CENTER></H3>


<P>     If you choose a frozen breakfast because convenience is a necessity, check
the serving size. If your selection weighs only one or two ounces, it may not
supply enough energy to get you through the morning. Although not exactly
immunity builders, waffles or French toast (without any toppings) would be
better choices than breakfast sandwiches containing high-fat meats.

     <H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LACTOBACILLUS HAS POSITIVE
     HEALTH EFFECTS
</CENTER></H3>

Studies show that viable yogurt alone or yogurt with fiber can be of benefit
to your colonic environment.
<B>Source:</B> <I>Journal of Nutrition</I>, Jan 1994, 124(l):18-23.
<BR><B>Editor's note:</B> <I>Food history reveals that societies that have enjoyed 
good health almost alwaysinclude,a fermented product in their daily diet. 
&quot;Viable&quot; yogurt signifies the presence of live, friendly bacteria, so yogurt 
should not be pasteurized after the fermentation process. In fact, federal law 
dictates that yogurt can only be so named if pasteurization precedes the 
fermentation process. Not all states follow this ruling, however. (Check with 
your local FDA office.) Another viable-yogurt bottleneck is the use of stabilizers 
and emulsifiers (tapioca and cornstarch are examples), which have been reported to 
inhibit access of friendly bacteria in the intestine. One portion of viable yogurt 
daily or one to two tablespoons  of liquid acidophilus after every meal is highly 
recommended for general health improvement.</I>

<P>Dill or sour pickles contain three calories an ounce; sweet pickles, <I>thirty</I> 
calories an ounce. All, however, contain about 300 milli-
grams of sodium per ounce. So go for the dill or sour variety-but watch your salt 
intake for other meals on days you indulge in pickles.
