<TITLE>Letters to Stakeholders on Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation</TITLE>

<H2>Letter to Stakeholders: How OCRWM Program Changes Impact the Office of Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation.</H2><HR>
June 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Colleague:<br>

<p>

This letter serves as a brief update to my February 8, 1996, letter to you concerning changes to

the Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM)

program, specifically as they impact the Office of Waste Acceptance, Storage and

Transportation.

<p>

As a result of Congressional guidance provided through the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations

process and future funding profiles, we are developing a revised Program Plan.  The

accomplishments of Fiscal Year 1995 have allowed us to reduce expenditures while maintaining

momentum toward our fundamental program objectives at Yucca Mountain.  We will

concentrate work at Yucca Mountain on the most significant outstanding technical and

engineering issues and complete the necessary portions of the Exploratory Studies Facility, with

a viability assessment in 1998.  

<p>

<strong>Budget.</strong>  For Fiscal Year 1997, $400 million has been requested to continue its efforts for both

the Yucca Mountain and Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation projects. 

<p>

<strong>Waste Acceptance and Transportation Strategy.</strong>  In Fiscal Year 1996, we are developing a

waste acceptance and transportation strategy that relies on the private sector for implementation,

so that fuel can be accepted from utilities and moved to an interim storage facility or a repository

as soon as either is available.  An acquisition strategy for equipment and services is being

developed, and industry and vendor views are being solicited through an Expression of Interest

notice in the Commerce Business Daily (May 24, 1996) and Federal Register (May 28, 1996).  A

copy of the Federal Register notice is enclosed for your information.  We will be prepared to

issue requests for proposals and award contracts if and when we receive direction to proceed with

near-term spent fuel interim storage.  This approach will offer a market stimulus for private

sector development of the requisite equipment and technology.

<p>

<strong>Section 180(c) Notice of Proposed Policy and Procedures.</strong>  On May 16, 1996, we issued a

Federal Register Notice of our proposed policy and procedures to implement Section 180(c) of

the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (copy enclosed).  Comments should be sent to the Department and

must be received on or before August 15, 1996.  We plan to issue the final policy and procedures

in June 1997.  

<p>

<strong>Multi-Purpose Canister/Legal-Weight Truck Casks.</strong>  The contract awarded to Westinghouse

Electric Corporation for the first-phase development of a multi-purpose canister (MPC) design

will be completed as scheduled, but as a result of budget reductions, OCRWM will not fund the

second (certification) and third (production) phases of MPC development.  In addition, having

completed regulatory testing of the General Atomics (GA)-4, OCRWM will discontinue funding

further development of the GA-9 and GA-4 legal-weight truck cask designs.  OCRWM will

make the technology developed under the MPC and GA contracts available to private industry

for further development.

 <p>

<strong>Interim Storage.</strong>  We plan to conduct non-site-specific work on an interim storage facility to

reduce development time if and when a storage site is identified and legislative authority

provided.  Our current planning is based upon the repository viability assessment in 1998, that in

Fiscal Year 1999, the program will receive statutory authority, sufficient funding, and a site

designation for an interim storage facility. 

<p>

or call my office at (202) 586-1462.
