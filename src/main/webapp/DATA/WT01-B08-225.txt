Helps Commerce Export Enforcement<BR>
Uncover Violation by a Denied Party</B><P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"><B> In the summer of 1992, Rolando Franco was found guilty of violating U.S. export control laws and received a two year suspended jail sentence, three years probation, and a $6,000 fine.  Franco, of South River, New Jersey, was also denied exporting privileges for five years.<P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"> Only a few months after Franco's sentencing, an Arizona manufacturer received an order from Franco's firm.  Even though the order was a domestic transaction, the manufacturer's export administrator routinely cross-checked the order against its current list of denied parties.  The firm discovered that both the name and the address corresponded to a "denied party" -- that is, a person or business which has been denied U.S. export privileges -- and so the firm contacted the Department of Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement.<P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"> It was a chilly day in October 1992, when Commerce Special Agents from the New York City Field Office visited the United Parcel Service office nearest Franco in South River N.J.  They discovered Franco was receiving deliveries from various manufacturers on a weekly and sometimes daily basis.  Subsequent inquiries with the U.S. Postal Service also disclosed that Franco had been mailing frequent "express mail export service packages."<P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"> Further investigation by Commerce Export Enforcement, and a search of Franco's business, revealed additional evidence of violations of the Export Administration Regulations and the July 1992 denial order.<P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"> On March 9, 1994, Franco was arrested and charged with violating the terms of the 1992 denial order.  He was subsequently found guilty, fined $3,000, and served five months imprisonment which was followed by three years supervised release.  In addition, he was denied export privileges for an additional ten years.<P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"> Illegal exporting activities can be stopped by export administrators who check their domestic and overseas orders against the current list of denied parties.  When a company discovers it is dealing with a denied party, the export administrator should immediately inform Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement. <P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"></font><font size=4><B>If you have reason to believe a violation is taking place or has occurred, you may report it to the Department of Commerce by calling its<blink> 24 hour</blink> hot line number: 1 (800) 424-2980</B><P>
