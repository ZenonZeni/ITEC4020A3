<h4>December 1995<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="ep"> EUROPE </A></H2>
<h4> Confronting the  pensions time bomb </h4>
<p>More and more governments are waking up to the fact that the pensions time bomb continues to tick. Unless it is defused, the levels of benefits promised under current pay-as-you-go state  pension systems will impose unacceptable burdens on future taxpayers. Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK have now all taken steps to reduce this future burden. Other countries such as France and Portugal are formulating their proposals. 

<p>This change in state benefit philosophy comes at a time when many European employers are recognising that their current supplementary pension provision may neither support their business strategy nor meet the needs of many of their employees. Could the pensions time bomb be just the stimulus employers need to better align their existing arrangements to support the needs of the business and its employees? We believe it is.

<p>Employers should start by clarifying benefit objectives and, in particular, how benefits provision should contribute to the creation, attraction and retention of an appropriate workforce. There are several issues that need examining.

<ul>
<li><b>Whose responsibility?</b> 
<br> Employers need to reinforce the message that the combination of state and employer provision is unlikely to provide acceptable living standards in retirement and that employees need to make provision through their own savings.  At the same time, some employees are demanding greater freedom to manage their own future.

<li><b>Employer cost control</b>
<br>  Increasing competition and declining margins, combined with the effects of greater disclosure through accounting standards, mean employers are beginning to measure their worldwide benefit obligations on a consistent and high quality basis. Companies are improving their methods of identifying and allocating costs, and this is leading them to understand better the need for cost control in their benefits provision. 

<li><b>Core-plus provision</b>
<br>  To address both the sharing of responsibility between employer and employee and cost control issues, some companies are moving towards a core-plus approach. A basic core level of benefits is provided by the company, with additional benefits provided only where employees are prepared to share costs.  

<li><b>Governance</b>
<br>  Who has the real power to effect change and make key management decisions about benefits provision? Bringing clarity to the decision-making process can raise efficiency because it clearly identifies responsibilities and speeds up change where needed. 

<li><b>Managing diversity</b> 
<br> The workforce is becoming increasingly diverse  in terms of its skills, career patterns and needs. To what extent should a company recognise this diversity in its benefits provision?  

<li><b>Role of benefits in total pay </b>
<br> Benefits are just one (albeit significant) element of an employees total financial remuneration. To what extent should benefits provision be considered in the context of total remuneration, and how?
</ul>

<p><b>Next steps.</b> An audit of existing provision will identify where current plans are misaligned with benefit objectives and enable companies to set priorities for change. Organisations that have already gone through such a process have ended up with better cost control and a more enlightened workforce that better appreciates its benefits provision.

<h2><a name="ar">ARGENTINA</A></H2>
<h4> Workers compensation law overhauled </h4>

 <p>The current workers compensation system is to be radically changed under legislation passed in September 1995, which is to be implemented by April 1996. The new law gives companies an excellent opportunity to reduce labour costs because it: 

<ul>
<li>eliminates the possibility of civil lawsuits against employers 
<li>restricts the occupational diseases that are covered 
<li>defines a set of standard criteria for permanent disability which will be used by all medical commissions. 
</ul>

<p>The first decision companies must make is whether to insure or self-insure against workers compensation risks. They will also need to evaluate a wide variety of factors, including economic conditions and the effect on their financial, taxation and accounting position. 

<p>The main changes are: 

<ul>
<li>New insurance companies (ARTs) are to be set up for the sole purpose of providing coverage of workers compensation risks. 
<li>Affiliation to an ART will free employers from any responsibility for claims. 
<li>Employers will have to affiliate themselves to an ART, unless they fulfil the statutory requirements relating to self-insurance (mainly concerning solvency). 
<li>Employers will have a free choice of ARTs, and insurance companies cannot refuse to insure employers. 
<li>The ARTs will be able to  set their own rate structure (expressed as a percentage of salaries subject to social security charges) for each type of employer. The structures can subsequently be adjusted according to actual claims experience. 
<li>Employees will no longer  be able to bring civil lawsuits relating to workers compensation claims against employers, except in certain circumstances (eg when employers have failed to meet health and safety requirements, and  as a result  an employee has had an accident). 
<li>Claimants will receive benefits in kind and in cash: 
	<ul>
	<li> Benefits in cash are defined essentially as annuities designed to replace salary payments, rather than the lump sums traditionally provided by previous schemes. 
	<li>Benefits in kind cover not only medical treatment and supplies but also rehabilitation programmes, vocational re-training schemes and burial services. 
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2><a name="au"> AUSTRALIA </A></H2>
<h4> Compulsory employee contributions to  superannuation funds introduced </h4>

<p> The government announced in the 1995/1996 budget that, from 1997, there will be a phased introduction of compulsory employee contributions to supplement the current compulsory employer-financed superannuation. Initial contributions will be 1% of salary, rising to 3% in the year 2000. Government contributions will also be made to match employee contributions dollar for dollar, up to a limit based on average weekly earnings. 

<p>Currently, the superannuation system in Australia consists of: 

<ul>
<li>compulsory employer-financed superannuation support for all employees (currently 6% of salary for large employers, rising to 9% for all employers by the year 2002) 
<li>additional voluntary superannuation support primarily financed by employers with minimal employee financing. 
</ul>

<p>With an election to be held prior to the implementation of this new measure, its fate is less than certain. However, the opposition has recently announced support for the continued increase of the current compulsory employer-financed superannuation support.

<h2><a name="be"> BELGIUM </A></H2>
<h4> New royal decree  creates uncertainties  for new pension law </h4>

<p>The pension law passed on  6 April 1995 (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9506.html#be">June 1995</a>) takes effect on  1 January 1996. Employers should adapt their pension plans to comply with the new legislation before that date, if they want to be free to do so without having to: 

<ul>
<li>consult the works council or, in its absence, the health and safety committee, or 
<li>inform the employees themselves before making the changes, if neither of these bodies exists. 
</ul>

<p>One requirement of the new law is elimination of sex discrimination for post-17 May 1990 service, which reaffirms the Barber judgment of that date. Those employers who, despite that judgment, continue to treat men and women differently will find the 1 January 1996 target date hard to meet. 

<p>Meanwhile, a royal decree on transfer values, transitional rules, and past service, is being drafted.  

<p>In its current form, the decree is not overly onerous concerning transfer values for new plan participants; their transfer values will be lower than they would be in the Netherlands or the UK, for example. It is even less onerous for pre-1 January 1996 participants because transitional rules, taking into account the level of funding, will be available to the plan sponsor. The draft decree also proposes a transitional period ending on 31 December 1996 for the formal adaptation of the plan rules and other documents to the new law and royal decree. 

<p>:On the other hand, its recommendation concerning past service in case of plan changes is extremely severe. It proposes that the reserve attributable to service prior to any plan modification may not be lower than one based on: 

<ul>
<li>the old benefit formula, and 
<li>the salary at retirement or  earlier termination. 
</ul>

<p>If this requirement is not eased before the publication of the decree, it will create two problems for plan sponsors: 

<ul>
<li>If benefit levels need to be reduced, it will be very costly. 
<li>Given the atypical nature of many Belgian pension plans, complex administrative difficulties will arise. 
</ul>

<h4> Pensions mobility: another case breaks down the barriers  further </h4>

<p>Following the Bachmann and Schumacker cases (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9504.html#eu">April 1995</a>), another case   G H E J Wielockx v Inspecteur der directe belastingen  has raised the issue of tax deductions for non-domestic (EU) life insurance and pension contributions and is a further step in the direction of allowing consistency of tax reliefs for retirement plans throughout the EU. 

<p>Mr Wielockx is a Belgian national who works as a self-employed physiotherapist in the Netherlands but lives in Belgium. He was denied a tax deduction in the Netherlands for contributions he made to a pension plan in the Netherlands on the grounds that he is a non-resident. Mr Wielockx claimed that discrimination of this type is contrary to EU law. 

<p>The Netherlands cited the Bachmann decision that such discrimination is allowable because of the lack of fiscal cohesion in different EU member states. In its judgment on 11 August 1995, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled against the Netherlands. This strengthens the view that Bachmann is a special case and that contributions made to EU pension plans and life insurance policies should be tax-deductible under EU law. However, a final resolution remains elusive.

<h2><a name="it"> ITALY </A></H2>
<h4> Best practice in action </h4>

<p>In this issue, we begin a series which looks at best HR practice in some of Italys leading companies, starting with the state-owned energy group, ENI. 

<p>During 1995, 15% of ENI has been privatised; it has already undergone a major restructuring, having sold all its non-core businesses (comprising 50,000 employees). This has changed the management structure and responsibilities of the 90,000 remaining staff and has been a major factor in the introduction of a management development system based on competencies (the underlying characteristics of people which result in effective and/or superior performance in a job). 

<p>The aim of the programme is to improve significantly each managers individual and collective performance to ensure that ENI maintains an internationally competitive position. Since competencies can be developed, the programme plays an important role in management development and career and succession planning. In this context, ENI has also recently introduced an expert system to improve its management selection and succession planning. 

<p>The expert system is much more sophisticated than a standard personnel database; it is a truly intelligent system, capable of identifying the essential characteristics of 200 key management positions and, when a vacancy occurs, selecting suitable candidates from anywhere within the group. 

<p>This is how the expert system works in practice: 

<ul>
<li>It contains all the basic information about managerial jobs, roles and incumbents. 
<li>It updates this information continuously with, for example, the results of performance appraisals and management by objectives (MBO) exercises, details of promotions and transfers, and any changes  to particular management positions. 
<li>It defines the essential characteristics of the 200 key management jobs within ENI and then matches them with the competencies of the individuals whose details are held on the system. The result of this analysis is a list of suitable internal candidates for each  of the positions. The lists change to reflect changes in the organisation and in the incumbents, but they always remain confidential. 
<li>When a vacancy occurs, a list of the most suitable people  which is much more comprehensive than the two or three obvious candidates  already exists. Although the expert system does all the groundwork, however, the final choice of successor is made by a selection board. 
<li>It tracks recent graduate recruits whom ENI has continued to hire, even during the restructuring, ensuring that they receive the necessary development and experience to enable them to fulfil their potential and follow fast-track careers. 
</ul>

<p>The expert system is already benefiting ENI; it ensures that management selection and succession planning are carried out consistently and effectively. It also enables the organisation to identify any gaps in its managerial skills which may need to be remedied by training. These are all important considerations for an organisation which is committed to internal promotion and investment in training.

<h4><a name="it2"> Salary survey highlights latest trends </a></h4>

<p>The results of Towers Perrins 1995 VALREM survey show that increases in annual base salary are running approximately in line with inflation for professionals and managers. Increases for blue- and white-collar workers, however, are not keeping pace with inflation. Sales staff received one of the highest increases (8.2%), reflecting the importance of sales in generating income in Italys current economic environment. 

<p>More than 100 companies with a combined workforce of nearly 360,000 employees participated in the survey; information relating to almost 5,000 incumbents was analysed. The most important trends highlighted by the survey are: 

<ul>
<li>Remuneration policy in Italy continues to be based mainly on the formula of fixed pay plus variable pay plus benefits. 
<li>More companies are introducing incentive systems,  particularly in functions such as sales, manufacturing and support services (quality, maintenance, purchasing etc). For example, incentives now account on average for 4% of total remuneration for impiegati (white-collar workers) and 12% for dirigenti (senior managers and executives). 	A number of other companies are planning to introduce incentive programmes when the countrys economic situation improves. 
<li>Estimated salary increases  (a combination of merit increases and an increase in the national agreements) for 1996, based on data collated from participating companies in September 1995, are: 
<ul>
<li> dirigenti (senior managers and executives) 6.1% 
<li> quadri (middle managers and senior professionals) 5.5% 
<li>impiegati (white-collar workers) 4.9% 
</ul>
</ul>

<p>These increases compare with a forecast inflation rate of 5.8% for 1995 and 5.2% for 1996. The official rates given by the government are 5.6% for 1995 and 4.5% for 1996. More detailed information for 1996 will be collated in the next VALREM survey from January 1996 onwards.

<h4> Employee EPF contribution rates increased </h4>

<h4> Flexible pension plans make progress </h4>

<p>The Dutch government has agreed to amend tax legislation to facilitate more flexible pension arrangements. This follows the report of a committee set up by the Secretary of Finance last year. Companies can implement the changes now, but will have a transitional period of five years before they are required to introduce them. Companies should review their schemes and identify where and when changes should be made. 

<p>The most important recommendations are: 

<ul>
<li>In final pay schemes, the maximum amount of pension is 2% (of pensionable salary) per year of service. Other types of schemes should provide benefits of the same  target level. 
<li>It should be possible to retire before normal retirement age (between 60 and 65) -  but not before age 55 -  but any pension must be actuarially reduced. 
<li>Employees should be able, with their employers consent, to retire at age 55 on a part-time basis. If they move to less senior positions within ten years before normal retirement age, they may continue to build up pension rights based on their former, higher salary. 
<li>If employees continue to work after their normal retirement date, their pension can continue to accrue up to a maximum of 100% of pensionable salary, including the state pension. 
<li>The definition of pensionable salary should be extended to include variable forms  of remuneration, such as bonuses and payments in kind. 
<li>Employees without sufficient pension rights should be allowed to make a supplementary payment at a later stage, provided they either worked in the Netherlands  or remained covered by the Dutch social security system while on a short-term secondment outside the country. 
<li>Company savings plan accounts should be able to  be released for use as contributions to existing pension schemes. Currently, such savings are blocked for a period of four years and may only be used to purchase annuities from insurers. 
<li>If a non-Dutch pension scheme has obtained corresponding approval in the Netherlands, it should be reviewed again within the next five years.

<h4> Employment Act amended </h4>

<p>With effect from 1 November 1995, the following key changes were made to the Employment Act: 

<ul>
<li>It now regulates the transfer of workers when employers restructure and move their business to a new corporate entity in Singapore. 
<ul>
<li> Workers must be notified of the transfer in advance and must be informed of the reasons, implications and measures being taken as a result of the change. 
<li>Employment is treated as continuous, and existing terms and conditions remain unchanged. 	 <li>The Commissioner of Labour, the Labour Ministry and the Industrial Arbitration Court all have the power to stop, delay or impose certain terms for the transfer to protect workers interests. </ul>
<li>The Labour Minister now has the power to regulate part-time employment. 
<li>The definition of pay used to calculate statutory payments (such as overtime, pay in lieu of notice) has been revised. 
<li>Shift allowances are now excluded for benefit determination purposes when workers are on outpatient sick leave. 
<li>Employees working on rest days are now entitled to: 
<ul>
<li>one days salary if they work up to half their normal hours, and 
<li>two days salary if they work more than half their normal hours. 
</ul>
<li>The Labour Minister has the power to exempt certain employees from the maximum 12-hour work restriction. 
<li>Workers with three months service are now eligible for pro-rated sick leave and can receive their full entitlement after six months. 
<li>The employment of children under age 14 in industrial jobs is prohibited.

<h4> Legislative developments </h4>

<p>Recent months have seen several legislation-driven developments in employee benefits, and more particularly in retirement funds. The most important of these have been the Pension Funds Amendment Bill 1995, the Registrar of Pension Funds Circular PF No 86, and the draft Labour Relations Bill. These are summarised below. 

<p><b>Pension Funds Amendment Bill 1995.</b> The Bill introduces changes which will have far-reaching effects on retirement funds from 1996 onwards: 

<ul>
<li>Almost all new funds from 1996 will be required to have a board of management consisting of at least three members. Members of the fund will be entitled to appoint  or elect one of the three. Existing funds will have until 15 December 1998 to comply with the new requirement. <p>The member representation requirements contained in the Bill should be viewed as a minimum requirement. Several parties, including the Commissioner for Inland Revenue, are on record as preferring to see equal member and employer representation. The draft Labour Relations Bill (see below) may also influence developments in this area. 
<li>The fiduciary duties of board members will, for the first time, also be set out in the Act. 
<li>The office of a Retirement Funds Adjudicator will be established. All funds will be required to comply with a prescribed dispute resolution procedure which will override any contrary provisions in the rules of the fund. Any member not satisfied with the response to a dispute may be referred to the Adjudicator. 
<li>The ability to deduct outstanding contributions from a members benefits will be restricted to contributions owed by the member only. 
</ul>

<p><b>Draft Labour Relations Bill.</b> This Bill is already being considered by Parliament. It states that: Unless the matters for joint decision-making are regulated by a collective agreement with the representative trade union, an employer must consult and reach consensus with a workplace forum before implementing any proposal concerning...changes made by the employer or by employer-appointed representatives on trusts or boards of employer-controlled schemes, to rules regulating social benefit schemes. 

<p>Many of the implications  of the Bill are still unclear. For instance, the exact interpretation of what constitutes an employer-controlled scheme is uncertain. However, it is probably safe to say that anything less than equal representation for members on the board of management of a scheme will constitute a case of employer control. An employer-appointed chairperson with a casting vote (on a board with equal representation) will probably also constitute employer control. 

<p>In the context of the Bill, social benefit schemes will include most (if not all) employee benefit schemes, retirement funds, medical benefit schemes and others. 

<p>The exact implications of the Bill should become clearer as it completes its passage through Parliament. 

<p><b>Registrar of Pension Funds, Circular PF No 86.</b> This deals with the minimum disclosure requirements to be applied to  all retirement funds with effect from 1 July 1996.

<p> Funds will have to provide: 
<ul>
<li>an explanatory pamphlet to new members within three months of joining a fund 
<li>an annual benefit statement for each member (excluding pensioners and deferred pensioners) to be distributed not later than six months after the financial year end of the fund. 
</ul>

<p>The circular defines the minimum information to be included in the pamphlet and benefit statement. Notification to members will also be required in certain specific circumstances, eg fund restructuring.

<h2><a name="es"> SPAIN </A></H2>
<h4> Insurance law finally comes into force </h4>

<p>After an extremely long, drawn-out and complex process, lasting nearly four years (see <I>Headlines</I> of <a href="9510.html#es">October 1995</a>), the new insurance law (Ley de Supervisie. 

<p>The law affects both individual and occupational pension plans. Below is a commentary on those aspects of the new law which employers will need to consider since they affect their current and future pension liabilities: 

<ul>
<li>The banning of book reserves as a financing vehicle for company pension plans leaves only two acceptable alternatives: qualified pension plans or group insurance. Companies have a transition period of three years in which to make their choice. Although this measure gives employees more secure pension rights, it has severe financial implications for those companies with heavy pension obligations. Many companies may try to renegotiate their current obligations. 
<li>The law introduces tax treatment that clearly favours qualified pension plans, reflecting the governments intention  of encouraging this form of provision. 
<li>The rules for qualified plans are: 
	<ul>
	<li> Plans must be open to all employees and be governed by a commission  of control with majority employee representation. Qualified majorities may be used for major decisions, thus giving effective veto powers to employers. 
	<li>  For new plans created during the transition period, contributions made to fund past service benefits will qualify for tax relief under identical conditions as for existing pension plans. This is a significant advantage as current pensions legislation is not so favourable to the creation of new plans.  A waiting period of six months applies before this transition rule comes into effect. 
	<li>  Re-equilibrium plans, to amortise existing deficits, must be filed with the office of Director General of Insurance, but they will not need its approval. This will make implementation of newly qualified plans much quicker. 
	<li>  Existing plans that are funded through deposit administration contracts (or similar vehicles) and that transfer their fund to a qualified fund will not pay capital gains tax on the accumulated gains at the time of transfer as long as they were created to fulfil obligations existing prior to 3 March 1995. 	 
	<li> The deficit amortisation period is extended from ten years to 15. Every year a minimum of 5% of the overall deficit must be amortised so that at least 50% has been amortised by the tenth year. 	 
	<li> Companies in the same group can meet their obligations through a single plan and fund, as long as all companies with obligations in the group participate.
	<li>  Although the annual contribution limit per participant has been raised to Pts 1,000,000 per year,  the tax deductible limit remains at Pts 750,000.
	</ul>
<li>The rule for group insurance is: 
	<ul>
	<li>  If a company wishes to take a tax deduction for the premiums it makes for past  or future service benefits of active employees, it will have to impute these to them as taxable income. Many companies using this alternative will forego the tax deductions to avoid this imputation. 
	</ul>
<li>Some companies who dont wish to open their plans  to all employees, and who view group insurance as an unfavourable alternative, may simply liquidate existing promises by converting them to cash compensation subject to requiring that these cash amounts be channelled to some form of individual retirement vehicle. 
</ul>

<p>The new legislation is extremely complex and will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming Towers Perrin Update.

<h4>New accounting rules for stock-based compensation </h4>

<p>After more than a decade of often-contentious debate, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has finally issued a new accounting standard, known as FAS 123, for stock-based compensation programmes.

<p>It applies to all companies - whether publicly or privately owned - that follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the US, including non-US multinationals and US subsidiaries of such multinationals that prepare US GAAP financial statements either to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements or as required by certain lending institutions.  FAS 123 applies to all of a company's stock-based compensation plans for executives, employees and outside directors, except for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), which are subject to a separate standard.  Covered plans include stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock grants and stock purchase plans.
