(1) ADMINISTRATION CRYPTO POLICY FLOPS AT CONFERENCE

On September 6 and 7, the Clinton Administration unveiled a new national 
cryptography policy at a conference sponsored by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST). 

CDT believes that the new proposal fails to provide adequate privacy 
protection, would effectively eliminate the domestic market for non-
escrowed encryption applications, and is weighed too heavily toward the 
interests of the National Security Agency.

The administration has proposed to relax export controls on 
cryptographic applications (both software and hardware) with key lengths 
up to 64 bits provided that:

* The keys required to decrypt a message or file are escrowed with an 
  agent certified by the US government (including private entities)

* The product does not decrypt messages or files encrypted with non-
  escrowed products or products whose escrow mechanisms have been 
  altered or disabled.

* As well as eight other criteria (the proposal is attached below).

NEW PROPOSAL FAILS TO ADHERE TO CRITERIA IN GORE LETTER TO CANTWELL.

In a July 1994 letter to then Representative Maria Cantwell, Vice 
President Gore announced that the Administration intended to re-examine 
its cryptography policy. The Gore letter, which was widely viewed as an 
abandonment of the Clipper Chip Government Key Escrow scheme, pledged to 
develop a policy framework that would promote the development of 
encryption systems that would meet the following criteria:

* Implementation in hardware of Software
* Public, Unclassified Algorithms
* Voluntary
* Forth Amendment privacy Safeguards
* Statutory liability rules to protect users
* Multiple Escrow Agents

On hearing that the Administration had set out to develop a new 
encryption policy based on the principles outlined in the Gore letter, 
the Center for Democracy and Technology was guardedly optimistic that a 
genuine policy breakthrough was possible.  However, having had the 
opportunity to review the current proposal, every principle, except the 
first (software implementation) and second (public algorithms), outlined 
in the July 1994 letter is violated or, in one case, left in doubt, by 
the September 1995 policy statement.

The September 1995 policy statement diverges from the July 1994 letter 
in the following critical respects.  In our view, these divergences 
represent fundamental defects in the proposed policy.

* NOT VOLUNTARY:  The current proposal effectively compels all domestic 
  users to use key escrow systems if they ever intend to communicate 
  internationally.  Point 6 of the export criteria requires that an 
  exportable system must not interoperate with any system that non-
  escrow systems.  Thus, in order for a user in the United States to 
  communicate with anyone who uses a United States-made system on the 
  Internet but outside of the United States, the American user must 
  employ a key escrow system.  Domestic users are not legally compelled 
  to use key escrow products, but the proposed policy forces, in 
  practice, all but the most insular Internet user toward a key escrow 
  system. Moreover, this proposal further illustrates that the 
  Administration seeks to use export controls to push the domestic use 
  of escrowed cryptography. A policy based on such compulsion can hardly 
  be called voluntary. 

* INADEQUATE SECURITY:  Point 1 precludes export of systems with key 
  lengths beyond 64 bits.  Though this key size is larger than what is 
  currently exportable, it is a level of security already judged 
  inadequate for some applications.  Given the rate at which computing 
  power increases, even a 64 bit key would be subject to attach before 
  long. Ironically, even the Clipper Chip provided a stronger (80 bit) 
  key length

  The premise of the key escrow policy is to provide law enforcement 
  and national security agencies a "front door" to be used to decrypt 
  messages when the agency obtains proper legal authorization.  Yet, the 
  architects of the current policy apparently are not willing to trust 
  that key escrow systems will meet law enforcement needs inasmuch as 
  the key length limit suggests that the Administration is intent on 
  maintaining an extra-legal method of decrypting communications.  The 
  Gore letter contains no suggestion that key escrow systems would also 
  be subject to key length limits but the Administration seems to have 
  lost faith in its own proposal.  Such a half-hearted effort cannot be 
  the basis of a long-lasting policy.

* NO PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR USERS OF ESCROWED SYSTEMS:  The ten export 
  principles make no mention of privacy safeguards which the Vice 
  President previously recognized as necessary to safeguard individual 
  privacy and Fourth Amendment principles.  Any escrow policy must 
  contain safeguards against abuse and statutory liability provisions 
  for the operators of private escrow systems.

* FAILS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  Points 6 and 10 of 
  the export criteria raise grave doubts as to the likelihood that the 
  current proposal will give rise to a secure global communications 
  environment.  Point 10 forces users in other countries (and their 
  governments) to accept United States-based escrow of all keys until 
  bilateral access agreements are entered into.  Such tactics seem 
  unlikely to produce satisfactory international agreements, and hold 
  global communications security hostage to the completion of such 
  agreements.

NSA/ADMINISTRATION SEEK TO RUSH IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW POLICY

The NIST Key escrow conference was billed as an opportunity to begin a 
dialogue between the administration and industry on the new cryptography 
policy. However, as the conference began it quickly became apparent that 
many of the critical policy issues, including the 64 bit key length, 
interoperability with non-escrow products, and some requirements for key 
escrow agents (including whether individuals, corporations, and foreign 
entities are eligible) have already been decided. 

The Administrations attempt to rush many of the critical policy 
decisions drew sharp reaction from virtually all of the conference 
participants, including CDT, other public interest groups, and 
representatives from several major software and hardware manufacturers. 
Although the administration and NSA officials all indicated that they 
got the message, they still intend to publish a revised policy in the 
next 30 days for comment.

INDUSTRY BALKS

Industry reaction to the new policy proposal was, with a few limited 
exceptions, decidedly negative. Both during formal presentations and in 
small group sessions, representatives from several of the largest 
hardware manufacturers and software publishers questioned whether the 
market would support products designed to adhere to the administration's 
proposal, particularly in light of the 64 bit key length limit.

CDT believes that the administration must make every effort to 
accommodate the concerns of the public, civil liberties groups, software 
publishers, hardware manufacturers, users, and other interested parties 
before adopting any new national cryptography policy. The current 
proposal fails to address many of the critical concerns of public 
interest groups and industry, and should be abandoned.

NEXT STEPS

The administration intends to published a revised policy within the next 
30 days (October 7). CDT will closely monitor this issue and will inform 
you as it develops.

(2) THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY

9/1/95 Proposed Cryptography Policy for Software Key Escrow

Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper #3

            Export Criteria Discussion Draft --
           64-bit Software Key Escrow Encryption

As discussed at the SPA/AEA meeting on August 17, 1995, the
Administration is willing to allow the export of software
encryption provided that the products use algorithms with key
space that does not exceed 64 bits and the key(s) required to
decrypt messages/files are escrowed with approved escrow agents. 
On the same date, the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting at
NIST was also announced.  The two principal topics at the meeting
will be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bit
software key escrow encryption and 2) desirable characteristics
for key escrow agents. 

In order to help make most productive use of the limited time
available at the upcoming meeting and to better focus
deliberation, the following criteria are being distributed for
discussion purposes.  Since it is important that final criteria
be clear, straightforward, consistent, and implementable, please
review these draft criteria and be prepared to discuss 
how they may be refined and made more specific.  

                          --- Draft Export Criteria ---

for Software Key Escrow Encryption 

Software key escrow encryption products meeting the following
criteria will be granted special export licensing treatment
similar to that afforded other mass-market software products with
encryption.  

1.    The product will use an unclassified encryption algorithm
      (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to exceed 64 bits.

2.    The product shall be designed to prevent multiple
      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).

3.    The key required to decrypt each message or file shall be
      accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the product,
      and such keys will be escrowed during manufacture in
      accordance with #10.  If such keys are not escrowed during
      manufacture, the product shall be inoperable until the key
      is escrowed in accordance with #10.

4.    The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include with
      each encrypted message or file, in a format accessible by
      authorized entities, the identity of the key escrow
      agent(s), and information sufficient for the escrow
      agent(s) to identify the key or key components required to
      decrypt that message.

5.    The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would
      disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include
      being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be
      disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a
      block of code by a modified block).

6.    The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted
      by non-escrowed products, including products whose key
      escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.

7.    The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's
      encrypted information regardless of whether that user is
      the sender or the intended recipient of the encrypted
      information.

8.    The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated
      involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of
      multiple decryption keys during the period of authorized
      access.

9.    In the event any such product is or may be available in the
      United States, each production copy of the software shall
      either have a unique key required for decrypting messages
      or files that is escrowed in accordance with #10, or have
      the capability for its escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and
      any new key to be escrowed in accordance with #10.

10.   The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only with
      escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or by
      foreign governments with which the U.S. Government has
      formal agreements consistent with U.S. law enforcement and
      national security requirements.

Note: Software products incorporating additional encryption
methods other than key escrow encryption methods will be
evaluated for export on the basis of each encryption method
included, as is already the case with existing products. 
Accordingly, these criteria apply only to the key escrow
encryption method incorporated by a software product, and not to
other non-escrowed encryption methods it may incorporate.  For
instance, non-escrowed encryption using a key length of 40 bits
or less will continue to be exportable under existing export
regulations.
