SATELLITE EXECUTIVES LOOK AHEAD TO A BOOMING NEW YEAR
Even as Regulatory Challenges Remain, Rollout Activity to Accelerate

     If the optimism of many satellite executives is any indication,
look for the big winners of last year to consolidate their lead, while
those left behind in 1995 play an increasingly difficult game of
catch-up.
     And 1995 was a whirlwind year.  "The most significant development
was the emergence of mobile satellite communications as a major
satellite service," said Donald Cromer, president of Hughes Space and
Communications Co..
     "I expect we're going to see phenomenal growth, evidenced from
almost day one," added John Farrell, president of Canada's TMI
Communications.  TMI's MSat satellite is slated for launch in March.
     But despite some executives' positive outlook, regulatory issues
will remain a big variable as companies enter 1996.  "The true hurdle
of this business is not the market, not the technology.  It's regula-
tory," said Stephen Morgan, director-business development for Little
LEO Starsys Global Positioning Inc.     
     Indeed, although the recently concluded World Radiocommunication
Conference (WRC-95) eliminated much of the spectrum uncertainty that
has plagued the mobile satellite service (MSS) industry, the
conference is only a prelude to the global task of acquiring licenses
in individual countries.
     However, several observers doubted that the difficulties
encountered at WRC-95 will re-emerge in countries' licensing
proceedings.  "As far as I know, there's nothing that will affect the
licensing process," said Lloyd Rezler, managing director of satellite
services for Globalstar L.P. partner AirTouch Communications Inc..
     For the second-round Little LEOs, "a holding pattern is a good
analogy," Morgan said.  "Although the planes are moving, they're going
in circles while the traffic controllers work madly."  Any solution
will come at WRC-97, he said.
     But in a year which will bring launches including Inmarsat's
third- generation satellites, TMI's bird and the first Iridium Inc.
satellites, many expressed enthusiasm for 1996.  "This is going to be
an interesting year for us," said Barry Bertiger, director of Motorola
Inc.'s satellite communications division.  "First launches are always
exciting."
     The initial Big LEO launches "should serve as an indicator as to
how quickly and effectively these new systems can be brought online,"
observed industry consultant Ed Martin.
     However, the launch failures of 1995 do not bode well for the new
year.  "The failure rate has got to come down and stay down, or
ambitious plans like the Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. will have a
terrible time rolling out," said Tim Logue, space and telecom analyst
for Washington law firm Reid & Priest.
     But while groundbreaking companies such as Iridium and Orbital
Sciences Corp. prepare their initial or follow-on launches, others
plan significant preparatory deals for the first part of this year. 
Odyssey, the Big LEO backed by TRW Inc. and Teleglobe Inc., expects to
seal its strategic partners as well as handset and launch vehicle
plans beginning in the first quarter.
     Odyssey launch vehicle candidates include the Ariane, Long March,
Proton and Soyuz rockets, while TRW has letters of intent for handset
development with OSC's Magellan Systems Corp., Japan Radio Co. and
Panasonic Corp.
    Further, look for Starsys--which is about to close its acquis-
ition deal with GE American Communications Inc.--to award satellite,
launch vehicle and handset deals soon.The FCC's Internat- ional Bureau
has a full mobile agenda for 1996, although its work has been halted
by the federal government's shutdown.  Issues include its twice-
delayed satellite policy review, as well as its Ka-band rulemaking.  
    The three remaining Big LEOs, deferred last year for lack of
financing, also are slated for an FCC decision by Jan. 31., although
this may be delayed.  Ellipso has entered into talks with Rockwell
International Corp. , as well as Telstra Corp., Australia's largest
carrier, while Constellation Communications Inc. and American Mobile
Satellite Corp. have remained guarded.
    But even the current MSS leaders still have significant finance
work left.  However, the satellite industry's growth will ease
financing, Hughes' Cromer said.  "I believe financial backing will
continue to become available as more satellite programs are proven and
business cases are demonstrated," he said.  
    Overall, "It will be a year of realistic thinking," AirTouch's
Rezler said.  "The weaker companies just simply won't get the funding. 
The stronger companies will be facing the realities of implementation. 
[By year-end], it will be a very strong industry with respect to the
remaining competitors."

APMT COMES TOGETHER WITH STRONG CHINESE AND SINGAPOREAN BACKING

     Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT), the latest
addition to the Asian regional mobile satellite fray, revealed
significant support from Chinese and Singaporean companies in a
founders' agreement announced in late December.
    People's Republic of China organizations China Aero-Space Corp.
(CASC), China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, China
Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp. (managed by China's
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications) and China Unicom Satellite
Telecommunication Co. Ltd. are involved in the $640 million deal. 
Additionally, Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. have a one-third stake between them.
    APMT, incorporated in Singapore as APMT Satellite Pte. Ltd., will
be funded by its six founding members, with local service providers
expected to dilute founders' shares as they take equity stakes.   
    Asia Mobile Telecommunications (Thailand) has received Thai
regulatory approval and reportedly will take a 10 percent equity stake
in APMT.  Additionally, APMT also has joined with Japan's Mitsubishi
Corp., and is talking to potential partners in four other countries,
reported the South China Morning Post.
    APMT currently is evaluating turnkey space/ground segment bids; a
report from an Asian correspondent had Hughes Space and Communications
Co. entering into final negotiations.  Hughes officials had no
comment.

  ...Courting the Asian Tigers, Or a Three-Ring Circus?

    APMT will join two other regional MSS projects, as well as the
four global MSS ventures, to vie for Asian subscribers starting in
1998 to 1999 (MSN, Sept. 21, 1995, p. 3).  And despite some concerns
of overcapacity, MSS companies--all with relatively limited
capacities--will enter a booming Asian mobile arena.
    Indeed, a 1995 study by Economic and Management Consultants
International Inc. (EMCI) predicts 78.8 million Asian cellular
subscribers in 2000, up from 10.7 million in 1994.  Japan will remain
the largest market in 2000, at 32.3 percent, but China will move to
second-largest, at 26.8 percent, EMCI said.
    But despite a promising market, APMT's entry still may affect the
jockeying of its competitors to develop strategic relationships in
China, particularly among the global MSS companies.  
    Although having contracts in China isn't a precursor to doing
business there, "China very distinctly insists on some level of
participation, generally above and beyond providing services," said
Iridium Inc. spokesman John Windolph.
    Both Globalstar L.P. and Iridium have launch contracts with
state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corp.  Iridium also has a
relationship with Long March developer CASC--also an APMT partner--
which will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for Iridium
service in China.  
    But London's ICO Global Communications Ltd. has the strongest
ties of the global systems: China's Inmarsat Signatory Beijing Marine
Communication and Navigation Co. recently upped its equity commitments
in ICO to $103 million.
    Globalstar, through partner AirTouch Communications, still is
developing its Chinese connections.  "[China] is the only major
territory that's very much up in the air with respect to their inten-
tions," said Lloyd Rezler, AirTouch's managing director-satellite
services.
    One potential wrinkle as companies seek to boost their Asian ties
may be the uneasy political situation between China and Taiwan.  "So
far, that's not been an issue, and we're hoping that the development
won't become a political issue in that respect," said Rezler.  "It's a
win-win for everybody to have these systems up and running."
    Added Iridium's Windolph, "They are distinctly separate
territories, and consequently they are being treated as such."

WRC-95 OPENS THE DOOR

    The Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. both achieved strong results at
this year's World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95), held in
Geneva by the International Telecommunication Union.  Teledesic wound
up the surprise winner after a strong international campaign to raise
awareness of its system, while the Big LEOs capped off their success
at 1992's conference with solid feederlink allocations.  ICO Global
Communications Ltd. had some difficulties due to the crowded nature of
its 2 GHz bands, but succeeded in its primary goal: advancing the
global availability date of its spectrum to 2000.
    The Little LEOs had to contend with the challenges of little
preparation time for WRC-95 and spectrum scarcity in bands below 1
GHz.  However, they succeeded in a small global allocation--as well as
more bands in the Americas--and improved their recognition by other
countries.
    Overall, WRC-95 showcased growing regionalism among ITU member
countries.  Aside from the usually cohesive European bloc, the
countries of the Americas joined on many items, as did the African and
Arab regions to a lesser extent.  Although European unity may spur
other regions to join on issues, observers noted that regionalism also
may be the only way the ITU can function with the ambitious agendas
and accelerated, two-year schedule of the WRC meetings.

COMMERCIAL SERVICE:  AMSC AND ORBCOMM BREAK NEW GROUND

    Despite developmental activity on all MSS fronts, 1995 also
brought commercial rollouts from American Mobile Satellite Corp.  and
Orbital Sciences Corp..  OSC launched its first two Orbcomm birds in
April and currently is marketing non-real-time telemetry applications
until it launches the rest of the 36-satellite system next year.  In
turn, AMSC began Skycell commercial voice and data service at the end
of the year.
    Both companies' technical hangups prior to beginning service show
the challenge of setting up satellite systems, as well as the effect
start-up problems have on investor confidence.  AMSC's and OSC's
respective glitches prompted uncertain diagnoses from the companies,
while both stocks suffered on Wall Street.  But even as the two
companies opened the way to providing MSS from dedicated satellites,
Qualcomm Inc. aggressively boosted the international rollout of its
OmniTracs fleet management service.  After breaking 100,000 total
terminals sold by the first quarter, the company established a
Malaysian subsidiary and expanded its operations in Mexico and Brazil.

MSS COMPANIES WATCH THE BOOMING IPO AND BOND MARKETS FROM AFAR

    The strong results of initial public offerings (IPOs) and bonds
in 1995 offered no solace to MSS companies attempting to enter the
market.  Underwriters scaled back the Globalstar L.P. IPO prior to its
release, only to see the stock sink, while both it and Iridium Inc.
cited high costs in pulling their high-yield debt offerings.  MSS
companies' forays to the credit market show that exceptional risk
inevitably will bring demands for high returns.  
    On the equity side, the unestablished nature and nonexistent cash
flow of MSS companies give stock analysts few reference points.  But
Globalstar illustrated how news-driven MSS stocks are, when its solid
WRC-95 results pushed its stock price up more than 80 percent above
its pre-conference level.
    The exception to the MSS companies' public financing trials was
ICO, which parlayed its Inmarsat heritage into $1.4 billion in private
commitments, while satellite vendor Hughes Space & Communications also
invested $94 million.  Both Iridium and Globalstar also turned to
internal backers as well in the wake of their attempted debt
offerings.

LICENSING:  U.S. LEADS THE WAY, WHILE EUROPE CHOOSES ITS COURSE

    The Big LEO regulatory marathon of 1994 ended in January when the
FCC deemed Globalstar, Iridium and Odyssey qualified to build their
systems.  Look for a ruling on the deferred LEO systems, Ellipso,
Constellation and AMSC, next month.  Little LEOs Starsys Global Pos-
itioning Inc. and Volunteers in Technical Assistance gained licenses
in July and November, respectively.  Starsys ended its foreign
investment impasse with the FCC by dropping its French ownership to 20
percent, while satellite giant GE Americom bought 80 percent.  
    Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) adopted a proposal to
have a final MSS regulatory structure in Europe by March 1997. 
Although the process is incomplete, observers said it likely will be a
comparative-hearing proceeding, including spectrum availability and
reciprocal market access issues.  Separately, the EC's competitiveness
directorate requested commercial information from Globalstar, ICO and
Iridium to ensure "level playing fields" for MSS in Europe.  
The Asian Regional Market Shapes Up
    Along with strong Asian telecom and broadcast satellite activity-
-as well as high cellular growth--three new Asian regional MSS systems
arose in 1995.  These alternatives to the global systems prompted
concerns of MSS overcapacity in Asia, but optimists said the
potentially huge market may dwarf systems' capacities.  Given the
region's low teledensity and per capita income, look for the economics
of low cost equalling high volume to play heavily in any MSS shakeout.

SMALL LAUNCH VEHICLES STUMBLE; TRADE LIBERALIZATION WITH CHINA AND
UKRAINE

    The nascent small launch vehicle industry had a tough year, with
launch failures of OSC's Pegasus XL, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s [LMT]
LMLV 1 and EER Systems Inc.'s Conestoga.  Meanwhile, the United States
loosened restrictions on the use of Chinese and Ukrainian launch
vehicles.  Generally, the negotiations balanced existing contracts set
before the agreements--such as Globalstar's and Iridium's deals--and
overall "carrot and stick" trade relations, against the protests of
manufacturers such as McDonnell Douglas Corp..

EXPANSION INTO BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES

    Notwithstanding Teledesic's pre-WRC obstacles, broadband boomed
in 1995.  AT&T Corp., Lockheed Martin, Loral Corp. , and Motorola Inc.
all announced geostationary broadband plans, with the FCC's October
application deadline bringing the total field to 15 proposed systems. 
The FCC also took a step toward resolving a spat pitting satellite
companies against local multipoint distribution service (LMDS)
advocates, by proposing a Ka-band plan in July.  The plan stayed
intact through WRC-95; look for an order this year.

THE AUCTION OPTION

    The auction debate escalated in 1995, with issues including how
to allocate licenses fairly and accommodate spectrum scarcity. 
Congressional pressure for auctions was a factor, but key
congressional and FCC officials said international systems may be
outside the debate.  The issue was punted to the FCC's satellite
policy review, although the federal budget brawl delayed the first
industry roundtable.  In the midst of the debate, the Satellite
Industry Association emerged as an advocacy group for the oft-
fractious satellite industry.

ICO REGULATORY MISCELLANY:  PATENTS AND INVESTMENT CONCERNS

    The U.S. patent agency awarded patents for TRW Inc.'s Odyssey
system, an event which TRW said would preempt ICO's system.  While TRW
proceeded to file patent applications worldwide, the State and
Commerce Departments raised questions about the separation of ICO and
Inmarsat, as well as the propriety of Comsat Corp.'s investment in
ICO.  Both issues remain unresolved.

FIRST FIVE IRIDIUM SATELLITES ARE IN PRODUCTION; 1996 LAUNCHES
SCHEDULED

     Iridium Inc. is on course to be the first of the Big LEOs in
orbit, with five satellites currently in the factory and a launch
slated for the fourth quarter.
    Construction is now ahead of contractual schedule; Iridium
sponsor Motorola Inc. chose to continue its buildout plans despite
spectrum uncertainty prior to last year's World Radiocommunication
Conference (WRC-95).  "From a construction standpoint, things are
actually going quite well," said Barry Bertiger, Motorola corporate
vice president and general manager of its satellite communications
division.   
    Bertiger lauded Motorola's relationship with its Iridium
subcontractors.  There have been "a couple cost claims" on the fixed-
price development subcontracts, but they are "all very minor," he
said.  The main subcontractors are Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon
Co., and rocket manufacturers China Great Wall Industry Corp.,
Khrunichev and McDonnell Douglas Corp..
    Motorola has two qualification spacecraft built, as well as the
five flight models in its Chandler, Ariz., plant.  For the Iridium
project Motorola introduced a "five-day, dock-to-dock" timetable for
turning satellite components into a complete spacecraft.  Currently
the company is holding a seven-day cycle time for initial production,
with the five-day goal set to begin with the 20th of the initial 72
Iridium satellites and spares, Bertiger said.
    After the early production run, Motorola will defer construction
until results are in from the first flight tests.  Regarding manuf-
acturing changes ifnecessary, Bertiger said the production
line is "reasonably flexible.  Minor changes we can handle fairly
easily."
      In-orbit "tweaking" is also possible, since the satellites'
software is programmable, he added.  Iridium will begin in-orbit
testing with three satellites in one plane, to test crosslinks between
satellites and L-band and gateway links with the ground.  A second
launch of two satellites will enable plane-to-plane crosslink tests.   
 Despite Motorola's aggressive satellite construction campaign, the
development schedule for Iridium's novel dual-mode handheld phones
will not be a issue, Bertiger said.  "Fortunately, that's all under
one umbrella here," he said.  Motorola has a working handset
prototype--"not portable, but transportable," with plans for a few
hundred prototype portables by 1997, he said. 

Motorola Signs for Five More Delta Launches

     Last month, Motorola added a five-launch Delta 2 order to its
existing $400 million, eight-launch contract with McDonnell Douglas. 
The follow-on launches, of three satellites each, will replenish the
initial 66-satellite, six-spare Iridium constellation.  Launches of
replacement satellites or spares will begin in 1998 or 1999,
"depending on when we need the satellites up," said Stephanie Nowack,
Motorola Satellite Communications Division spokeswoman.

  ...Mac-Dac Develops New Delta Components to Handle Iridium Launches

    Building a launch vehicle fairing to hold five satellites is a
first for McDonnell Douglas, said Will Hampton, a program manager with
McDonnell Douglas.  To accommodate the Iridium satellites atop its
Delta 2 rocket, Mac-Dac created a new fitting to interface with the
second stage, as well as a new satellite dispenser.  Meanwhile, the
whole assembly will be encased in a new composite (rather than
aluminum) fairing.  The Iridium launch vehicle production is in the
existing Delta production flow and is on schedule, Hampton added.
    Motorola and McDonnell Douglas officials declined to give
specific dates for the first launch, although a manifest from the
Office of Commercial Space Transportation shows an Iridium launch
slated for September.
    Hampton said the satellites will arrive at the Vandenberg Air
Force Base launch facilities five weeks before launch.  The Iridium
program is "much more 
streamlined in terms of vehicle processing," he said.  "They've done
very impressive work in terms of the amount of time they've been able
to reduce."

  ...Globalstar Cutting Metal, While Odyssey and ICO Prepare

    Globalstar L.P. ICO Global Communications Ltd. and Odyssey, the
two other Big LEO consortia, also are proceeding with their satellite
development plans, although all are behind Iridium to varying degrees.
    Globalstar space segment manufacturer Space Systems/Loral has
built a prototype satellite, as well as basic elements of the flight
models, said Globalstar Executive Vice President Tony Navarra.  The
first flight model is due this fall, he said.  Navarra acknowledged
Iridium's progress, but said he expects Globalstar will be first to
market, since its system can operate (at reduced capacity) with only
32 satellites.  But regarding Iridium's groundbreaking launch, "We're
absolutely looking forward to it," he said.
    Meanwhile, Odyssey sponsor TRW Inc. and ICO (through its
satellite builder Hughes Space and Communications Co. remain embroiled
in their well-known squabble prompted by TRW's patents of the Odyssey
constellation.  
    Hughes is in the early stages of the recently awarded ICO
program, although satellite construction has not begun.  Regardless,
"We're not waiting for any patent considerations here," said a company
spokesman.
    In turn, TRW is concluding development of the Odyssey satellites'
internal propulsion, and has successfully tested the Odyssey L-band
antenna design.

DEFENSE MERGER WILL KEEP SATCOMS SEPARATE

     The $10 billion Lockheed Martin Corp.Loral Corp. merger announced
this week will keep the defense giants' satellite communications
businesses separate, the two companies said.  "Loral now will be a
leading space and communications company," said company Chairman
Bernard Schwartz in a statement outlining the merger.  The new Loral
Space and Communications Corp. will retain its 31 percent stake in Big
LEO Globalstar L.P., as well as its 33 percent stake in manufacturer
Space Systems/Loral (SS/L).  Additionally, Lockheed Martin will invest
$344 million for a 20 percent equity share of Loral Space.  However,
the two may find some commercial overlap.  While SS/L is the primary
builder of Globalstar's satellites (and owns 37.5 percent of
Globalstar), Lockheed Martin is leading the construction of Iridium
Inc.'s satellites.  On the broadband side, Loral and Lockheed Martin
have their respective Cyberstar and Astrolink projects.  Despite a
short day of trading due to a blizzard on the East Coast, Globalstar's
stock shot up 23 percent the day the merger was announced, reaching at
one point a high of $44.50 per share.  (Lockheed Martin, 301/897-

MIKE SYNAR DIES AT AGE 45

     Mike Synar, former Oklahoma Representative and ambassador-
designate of the U.S. delegation to last year's World
Radiocommunication Conference, died of cancer Jan. 9 at home in
Washington.  
     Synar embraced the technical issues of WRC-95 with the same self-
assured exuberance that typified his eight terms in Congress.  "I
think the principle that evolved our telecom system in Oklahoma must
guide us for WRC-95," he told Phillips editors in a 1995 interview. 
"And that is this:  We believe that the American telecommunications

MILSTAR SATELLITES' CROSSLINKS CHECK OUT; PARALLEL CONCEPT TO
IRIDIUM'S

     Lockheed Martin Corp. announced last month that the first two
Milstar geostationary satellites, built for the U.S. military, have
successfully relayed messages via their intersatellite links.
    Lockheed Martin billed the event as the first use of satellite
crosslinks; ordinarily, traffic is transferred between satellites by
"double-hopping" via ground stations.  When fully operational, the
Milstar system will relay high-priority voice, data and video traffic
to fixed, mobile and man-portable units.
    Several commercial systems have specified crosslinks in their
design, including Iridium Inc., the Motorola Inc.-sponsored Big LEO
that counts Lockheed Martin among its contractors.  "Iridium is based
somewhat on the technology developed for Milstar," said Lockheed
Martin spokesman Eric DeRitis. "It gave us the knowledge to produce
the crosslinks for Iridium."
    The parallel is not exact.  The two Milstar satellites (four more
will be launched, starting in 1999) relay traffic between their
respective central Pacific Ocean and continental United States orbital
slots, while Iridium only will send traffic through adjacent
satellites in its 66-satellite network.  Further, the Milstar
crosslinks operate at 60 GHz--for security, since stray signals are
absorbed by the atmosphere--while Iridium's crosslinks are at 28 GHz.
    "We've never been all that concerned about intersatellite links,"
said Barry Bertiger, general manager of Motorola's satellite
communications division.  "They're pretty straightforward point-to-
point microwave links."  The links have been fully tested on the
ground, he added.
    However, even the Milstar system does not have crosslinks between
satellites in different planes (and moving in different directions),
as Iridium does.

  ...Crosslinks Offer Security Advantages for the Milstar System 

    By using intersatellite links, the Milstar system reduces the
U.S. military's reliance on potentially vulnerable (and expensive)
ground stations outside the United States.  However, innovation comes
at a premium.  Unclassified funding for the Milstars and mission
control as of Sept. 30, 1994, was $6.4 billion, according to our
sister publication SPACE BUSINESS NEWS.
    Lockheed Martin designed Iridium's crosslinks, with Com Dev
manufacturing antennas and Gorca Systems Inc. providing systems
engineering.  Although crosslinks have obvious military benefits,
Iridium's have led its competitors, among others, to assert that it
will bypass local networks in routing calls to end users--a scenario
Iridium officials vehemently deny.  Iridium maintains that its network
is designed to interconnect with all existing telecom systems.
