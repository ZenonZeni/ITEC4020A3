FANNIE LIMIT MOVE TO $207,000 IMMINENT

Fannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conforming
loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to
$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industry
sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its customers to raise
its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect Jan. 1,
sources said. And the agency, which had maintained that would fully
consider the views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make
its announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of the agency's higher limit.
        However, those occurrences may not have qualified as a trend.
Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie raised
its limits, and a Freddie spokesperson couldn't confirm whether the company
had actually seen an increase in commitments, offering that it had no
updated data to support that conclusion.
        But in talks with its customers over the last month, Jeffers said
Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the change in the
marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew that to be a real
possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to Freddie, "though it's
too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be surprised."
        Freddie Mac decided to raise its limits in December to match a rise
is the Federal Housing Finance Board's home price index. Both Fannie and
Freddie's loan limits are statutorily tied to the index, but Fannie opted
not to raise its limits, thus making the conforming loan limits different
for each agency for the first time ever.
        The debate over raising the limits revolves around the FHFB index,
an economic indicator that has declined each of the last two years. Despite
declines in 1993 and 1994, neither government-sponsored enterprise lowered
its loan limit, decisions that garnered criticism from Congress and HUD
Secretary Henry Cisneros. But declines in home price index are considered
anomalies, so when the index rose for the first time in three years in
November, Freddie lifted its limit to match the increase; Fannie kept its
limit at $203,150. Freddie's critics immediately charged that agency had
raised the limit without considering the previous year's decreases.
        Freddie's decision also  sparked the ire of some in the thrift
industry who contended that the agency is encroaching on the lower crust of
the jumbo loan market niche it has carved out. Freddie Mac argues, however,
that that is not the case, noting that only 1% of all its 1994 loan
purchases were for the loan limit maximum.
        Lawmakers chided Freddie for its decision and praised Fannie for
maintaining its limit. Privately, House Banking Committee sources
acknowledged that the market was likely to force Fannie to raise its limit.
        Freddie's decision also affected the Federal Housing
Administration. Although Freddie's loan limits are tied to FHFB's index,
FHA's limits are tied to Freddie Mac's conforming loan limit. So when
Freddie upped its limits, it inadvertently raised FHA's. HUD pondered
whether it had the statutory authority to avoid raising the limits, but
after a week of review it concluded that it too had to make an increase.
Minus the statutory authority to force Freddie or FHA to maintain its
limits, one House Banking Committee staffer expected the issue to be taken
up by Congress early in 1996.
        The differing loan limits has caused problems for lenders, the
biggest of which are the costs associated with having to split their
portfolios between Fannie and Freddie, said Vicki Vidal, director of
government agency relations for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Anything
above the Fannie limit must be segregated from Freddie pools and that takes
manpower and diligence," she said. "In some cases a (computerized) system
can tell you, but some for some lenders the actual physical shipping and
handling has to be done."
        Some Fannie-exclusive lenders also faced the additional costs of
switching to Freddie Mac's system. One mortgage industry lobbyist said that
with mortgage origination margins thin anyway, some lenders weren't look
fondly upon switching, primarily because of the costs associated and the
time it would take to retrain their staffs.

SEC ISSUES DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING RULE

The Securities and Exchange Commission said its proposed
regulations on derivatives disclosure are aimed at closing three kinds of
problems it found during an extensive review of company reports, but the
initial reaction of some thrift lenders is that the rule may be redundant.
        The SEC proposed amending its regulations to clarify and expand its
existing requirements for financial statement footnote disclosures about
registrants' accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.
Specifically, the proposed rule changes would affect SEC Regulations S-X,
S-K and various forms including Form 20-F. The proposed amendments were
published in the Jan. 8 Federal Register; comments are due to the SEC by
May 7.
        "This rule appears to be much farther reaching than one would
initially conclude," said Marti Sworobuk, accounting manager for America's
Community Bankers. ACB's accounting committee hasn't reviewed the proposed
regulation yet, but Sworobuk offered that "it doesn't appear to be so much
as a derivative disclosure as it is a document intended to require
financial institutions to disclose how they manage interest rate risk," she
said.
        Under the proposed rule, she said, SEC-regulated institutions would
be required to disclose of whatever they are doing to manage risk, such as
hedging risk by using loan portfolios or by matching the terms of their
funding sources. "It doesn't just involve derivative instruments," she
said.
        Sworobuk said ACB may be interested in how much additional burden
the rule would put on thrifts--if any. "The SEC should recognize that some
financial institutions are already submitting the same kind of information
to banking regulators," she said, speaking of the Consolidated
Maturity/Rate Schedule, or CMR, that thrifts are already required to submit
to the Office of Thrift Supervision. Other banking regulators are expected
to implement similar disclosures later this year, Sworobuk added, possibly
as soon as June.
        "These disclosures provided to the agencies under FIDICIA 305 would
meet the requirements initiated by the SEC," she said.
        The SEC amendments would only affect publicly traded institutions,
but it is also likely to have an effect on the business strategies of
acquisition-minded commercial banks, mortgage banks and thrifts. Merger
activity among banks has been strong over the last year, and SEC-regulated
lenders may have to more closely consider the derivative accounting
practices of any institution they've targeted for acquisition.
        "The proposed amendments were developed after extensive review by
the SEC staff of disclosures made by approximately 500 registrants and
consideration of the findings of studies published by various public and
private sector organizations," said SEC Chief Accountant Michael H. Sutton.
"The commission is hopeful that the proposed disclosures are responsive to
concerns of investors and will head to more useful disclosures about
derivatives and other related instruments."
        The SEC wants to improve what it considers inadequate disclosures
about companies' accounting policies. Its proposal would require "enhanced
descriptions in the footnotes to the financial statements of accounting
policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity
instruments," the agency said.
        The agency is also looking to improve companies' disclosures of
market risk, which the SEC said applies to financial instruments other than
derivatives. Here the agency said it wants to see both quantitative and
qualitative disclosures. For quantitative disclosures, the agency is
proposing three alternatives from which firms would be free to choose.
These are:
         Tables showing expected cash flows and related contract terms
categorized by expected maturity dates.
         Sensitivity analysis showing the possible loss in earnings, fair
values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from certain
hypothetical changes in rates or prices.
         Value at risk disclosures showing the  potential loss in earnings,
fair values or cash flows of market risk over a selected period of time
from events with selected probabilities of occurrence.
        The qualitative disclosures about market risk would cover how a
company manages its exposures with "a description of the objectives,
general strategies and instruments, if any, used to manage those
exposures."
 The third kind of problem the SEC wants to correct occurs when firms do
not provide information about derivatives tied to other activities that are
disclosed.
        "For example, when the information is required to be disclosed in
the footnotes to the financial statements about interest rates and
repricing characteristics of debt obligations, registrants should include,
when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives," the SEC said.
        "Similarly, summary information and disclosures in Management's
Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") about the cost of debt obligations should
include, when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives."
        In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
the SEC said it would look at ways provide a safe harbor where appropriate
in the derivatives disclosures. These particular proposals would generally
not apply to mutual funds or small business issuers, although some of the
disclosures could be required under separate regulations.
        The SEC said it will take comment on the proposals until May and
expects to revisit the rules after five years.

IRS FINALIZES DEBT FORGIVENESS REGULATION

The Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of discharge
of indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than the
proposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for comment
in 1993.
        America's Community Bankers reacted to the new rule by saying it
"substantially mitigated" the compliance burden on the lending industry
imposed by the temporary rule. For example, said James O'Connor, tax lawyer
for the ACB, the "indebtedness" on which reporting is required to limited
to stated principal and does not include interest and penalties.
        Rick Steinegar, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association's tax
subcommittee and director of taxes for GE Capital Mortgage Corp. said the
rules "are an improvement over the proposed rule." For example, it gives
entities covered by the regulation until Dec. 26 to gear up to comply.
Moreover, it gives specific instances where disclosure is triggered, unlike
the proposed rule, which provided a less-specific "facts and circumstances"
criteria that would have made it more difficult for institutions to
determine if compliance was required.
        Steinegar also noted that the final rule will only apply to
"applicable financial entities," such as direct or indirect units of bank
or thrift holding companies and government-sponsored enterprises. That does
not cover independent mortgage bankers, he said.
        Independent mortgage bankers would be required to comply only when
they acted as a servicer for a government-sponsored enterprise, such as
GNMA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the VA.
        "It is much more specific and easy to comply with," he said.
        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, require
financial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C information
returns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600
or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders because
they say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven in
excess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.
        But lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating
the need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS
for several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need to
forgive debt.
        The final rules are effective for discharges of indebtedness
occurring after Dec. 21, 1996. No penalties will be imposed by the IRS for
failures to file until then, O'Connor said.

NOTEBOOK


HUD Finalizes Reg
For HECM Endorsements
        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage program will now find processing these loans without approval from
the department easier.
        HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approved
lenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its direct
endorsement program. Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17,
but the final rule, which appears in the Dec. 21 Federal Register, makes
the change official; it also completes one of many streamlining procedures
HUD has initiated over the last several months.
        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECM
that lenders have not issued a conditional commitment is eligible for
direct endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insured
before Sept. 15, 1995 must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUD
office for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance.
        If HUD deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it
will give the lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE
program. o
Freddie Revises Rules
For Balloons and Resets
        Freddie Mac seller/servicers will need to contact reset and balloon
mortgage borrowers about 50 days earlier than they're used to, according to
revisions that Freddie Mac has made to its seller/servicer guide.
Under the revised guidelines, which were announced in Bulletin 95-13,
lenders must now notify borrowers between 100 and 110 days before the
loan's maturity date, if not required sooner by law. Under Freddie's
previous guidelines, lenders were required to contact borrowers at least 60
days before the balloon maturity date. Additionally, Freddie said it has
added information that servicers must include in the notification, and has
also provided more guidance to lenders in working with borrowers who do not
meet reset conditions and can't pay off their balloon/reset mortgages.
Freddie said the new requirement would take effect June 1. o
HUD Reaches Accords
With Nine FHA Lenders
        Nine FHA-approved lenders reached settlement agreements with HUD
for a variety of irregular actions involving Federal Housing Administration
programs, the department announced Dec. 12.
        The department's Mortgagee Review Board, which investigated the
lenders based on suggestions from HUD field offices, cited The Money Store,
Sacramento, Calif., for violations of HUD-FHA Title I property improvement
loan requirements. Specifically, the board said TMS failed to properly
service Title I loans, did not submit timely FHA insurance claims and
failed to report timely the sale of Title I notes and transfers of
insurance reserves. As a settlement agreement, TMS agreed to pay HUD
$35,000, cancel insurance on several loans and submit to future reviews by
the department.
        Among the other eight lenders HUD reached settlements with in
December was the New England National Mortgage Corporation, Andover, Mass.,
which was cited for permitting non-exclusive employees to originate FHA
loans, and First American Mortgage Co., Sulphur Springs, Texas, which was
cited for permitting borrowers to hand-carry verifications of employment
and failing to perform face-to-face interviews. New England National agreed
to pay an undisclosed civil money penalty and First American agreed to
indemnify HUD for claim losses. Both also agreed to implement corrective
actions.
        Other settlement agreements included: Western Fidelity Mortgage
Co., Salt Lake City; Pacific Inland Mortgage Corp., Anaheim Hills, Calif.;
Interbank Funding Group, San Diego; Mortgage America Nationwide, Grand
Terrace, Calif.; Unifed Mortgage Corp., San Diego; and Z and Z Funding
Group, San Diego. As part of the settlement, the lenders do not admit to
any fault or liability. o
Fed Offers Video
On Home Buying Process
        The Federal Reserve Board is offering an educational video for
consumers it hopes will enlighten prospective home buyers on the nuances of
obtaining a mortgage.
        The video, entitled "Both Borrower and Lender," is designed for
first-time home buyers and is divided into four segments: Financial
preparedness; types and terms of mortgages; the mortgage application
process; and settlement and closing. The entire program is roughly two
hours long with each segment runs about 30 minutes.
        The video can be reviewed on the American Bankers Association
satellite network, American Financial Skylink, Jan. 30, and is available
for single or bulk purchase from VIDICOPY at a rate of $12.95 each for
orders of 30 or fewer copies; orders of above 31 or more copies are
available for $11.45 each.
For more information, write to: VIDICOPY, 650 Vaqueros Ave., Sunnyvale
Calif., 94086, or call (800) 708-7080. Information on Skylink is available

FANNIE JOINS RURAL HOUSING SERVICE'S AMERICAN INDIAN PILOT PROGRAM

Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certain
American Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated with
lending on tribal trust lands. Starting in January, Fannie will begin
taking part in the Rural Housing Service's Rural Housing Native American
pilot, but will limit its initial participation to 10 tribes.
        The eligible tribes include: Gila River, Arizona; Navajo Nation,
Arizona; San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico; Pala Band of All Mission, California;
Salish-Kootenai, Montana; Chippewa-Cree, Montana; Seminole Nation, Florida;
Cheyenne River Sioux, South Dakota; Lac Courte Oreilles, Wisconsin; and
Omaha, Nebraska.
        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed
$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they have
a good working relationship with RHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added later in the
pilot.
        RHS has also determined that these tribes have a judicial system
that supports mortgage lending and are receptive to using debt refinancing
for new and existing homes. They are likely to approve the required legal
documents without extensive changes, and have at least 10 tribal members
who have sufficient income and credit histories to qualify for a mortgage,
Fannie said.
        In a related issue, Fannie (Announcement 95-21) has clarified that
it does not place a limitation on the number of Section 184 Indian Housing
Authority mortgages it will buy. In Announcement 95-06, the company said
those loans would be considered as being secured investment properties.
This prompted questions, the agency said, about whether a borrower
financing a number of properties is eligible.
