The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program is to achieve significant 
environmental and public health benefits through
reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
the primary causes of acid
rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program 
employs both traditional and
innovative, market-based approaches for controlling air pollution. In addition, the program
encourages energy efficiency and pollution prevention.<p>
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets as its primary goal the reduction 
 of annual SO2 emissions by 10
million tons below 1980 levels. To achieve these reductions, the law 
requires a two-phase tightening
of the restrictions placed on fossil fuel-fired power plants.<p>
 Phase I began in 1995 and affects 110 mostly coal-burning electric 
 utility plants located in 21 eastern
and midwestern states. Phase II, which begins in the year 2000, 
tightens the annual emissions limits
imposed on these large, higher emitting plants and also sets restrictions 
on smaller, cleaner plants fired
by coal, oil, and gas. The program affects existing utility units 
serving generators with an output capacity of greater than
25 megawatts and all new utility units.<p>
 The Act also calls for a 2 million ton reduction in NOx emissions by the year 2000. A significant
portion of this reduction will be achieved by coal-fired utility boilers that will be required to install
low NOx burner technologies and to meet new emissions standards.<p>

<h3>Operating Principles:  Feasible, Flexible, Accountable</h3>
<hr>

The Acid Rain Program is implemented through an integrated set of rules and guidance designed to
accomplish three primary objectives:<br>
<ol>
<li>Achieve environmental benefits through reductions in S02 and NOx emissions.
<li>Facilitate active trading of allowances and use of other compliance options to minimize compliance
costs, maximize economic efficiency, and permit strong economic growth.
<li>Promote pollution prevention and energy efficient strategies and technologies.
</ol>
Each individual component fulfills a vital function in the larger program:
<ul>
<li>the allowance trading system creates low-cost rules of exchange that minimize government intrusion and make allowance trading a viable compliance strategy for reducing SO2
<li>the opt-in program allows nonaffected industrial and small utility units to participate in allowance trading
<li>the NOx emissions reduction rule sets new NOx emissions standards for existing coal-fired utility boilers and allows emissions averaging to reduce costs
<li>the permitting process affords sources maximum flexibility in selecting
the most cost-effective approach to reducing emissions
<li>the continuous emission monitoring (CEM) requirements provide credible accounting of emissions to ensure the integrity of the market-based
allowance system and the achievement of the reduction goals
<li>the excess emissions provision provides incentives to ensure self-enforcement, greatly reducing the need for government intervention
<li>the appeals procedures allow the  regulated community to appeal decisions with which it may disagree
</ul>
Together these measures ensure the achievement of environmental benefits at the least cost to society.<p>

<h3>Environmental Benefits</h3>
<hr>

     Acid rain causes acidification of lakes and streams and contributes to damage of trees at high elevations (for
example, red spruce trees above 2,000 feet in elevation).  In addition, acid rain accelerates the decay of building materials and paints, including
irreplaceable buildings, statues,and sculptures that are part of our nation's cultural heritage.
Prior to falling to the earth, SO2 and NOx gases and their particulate matter derivatives, 
sulfates and nitrates, contribute to visibility degradation and impact public health.<p>
     Implementation of the Acid Rain Program under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments will confer significant benefits on the nation. 
By reducing SO2 and NOx, many acidified lakes and streams will significantly improve so that they can once
again support fish life.  Visibility will improve, allowing for increased enjoyment of scenic vistas across our country, particularly in National Parks.  
Stress to our forests that populate the ridges of mountains from Maine to Georgia
will be reduced.  Deterioration of our historic buildings and monuments will be slowed.  Finally,
reductions in SO2 and NOx will reduce sulfates, nitrates, and ground level ozone (smog), leading
to improvements in public health.<p>

<h3>Allowance Trading</h3>
<hr>

 The Acid Rain Program represents a dramatic departure from traditional command and control
regulatory methods that establish specific inflexible emissions limitations with which all affected
sources must comply. Instead, the program introduces an allowance trading system that harnesses
the incentives of the free market to reduce pollution.<p> 
 Under this system, affected utility units were allocated allowances based on their historic fuel consumption and a specific emissions
rate. Each allowance permits a unit to emit 1 ton of SO2 during or after a specified year. For each
ton of SO2 discharged in a given year, one allowance is retired, that is, it can no longer be used.<p>
 Allowances may be bought, sold, or banked. Any person may acquire allowances and participate
in the trading system. However, regardless of the number of allowances a source holds, it may not
emit at levels that would violate federal or state limits set under Title I of the Clean Air Act to protect public
health.<p>
 At the end of the year, utilities are granted a 30-day true-up or grace period, during which SO2
allowances may be purchased, if necessary, to cover each unit's emissions for the year. At the end
of the grace period, the allowances a unit holds in its compliance account must equal or exceed
the annual SO2 emissions recorded by the unit's monitoring system. Any remaining allowances may be sold or
banked for use in future years.<p>
 During Phase II of the program, the Act sets a permanent ceiling (or cap) of 8.95 million
allowances for total annual allowance allocations to utilities. This cap firmly restricts emissions and ensures that environmental benefits will be achieved and maintained.<p>

<a href="allsys.html">Allowance System</a>

<br><a name="ats"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>The Allowance Tracking System</h3>
<hr>

 EPA has instituted an electronic recordkeeping and notification system called the Allowance
Tracking System (ATS) to track allowance transactions and the status of allowance
accounts. ATS is the official tally of allowances by which EPA determines compliance
with the emissions limitations. Any party interested in participating in the trading system may
open an ATS account by submitting an application to EPA. Accounts contain information on
unit account balances, account representatives (which must be appointed by each
trading party), and serial numbers for each allowance. ATS is computerized to expedite the
flow of data and to assist in the development of a viable market for allowances.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="ats/atsintro.html">Allowance Tracking System</a>

<br><a name="auctions"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Auctions and Direct Sales</h3>
<hr>

EPA holds allowance auctions and a direct sale annually. The auctions 
help to send the market an
allowance price signal, as well as furnish utilities with an additional 
avenue for purchasing needed
allowances.  The direct sale offers allowances at a fixed price of 
$1,500 (adjusted for inflation). Anyone can buy allowances in
the direct sale, but independent power producers (IPPs) can obtain 
written guarantees from EPA
stating that they have first priority. These guarantees, which are 
awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, secure the option for 
qualified IPPs to purchase a yearly amount of allowances over
a 30 year span. This provision enables IPPs to assure lenders that 
they will have access to the
allowances they need to build and operate new units.<p>

<br><a name="optin"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Voluntary Entry:  The Opt-in Program</h3>
<hr>

The Opt-in Program expands EPA's Acid Rain
Program to include additional sulfur dioxide (SO2)
emitting sources.  Recognizing that there are
additional emission reduction opportunities in the
industrial sector, Congress established the Opt-in
Program under section 410 of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990.  The Opt-in Program allows
sources not required to participate in the Acid Rain
Program the opportunity to enter the program on a
voluntary basis, reduce their SO2 emissions, and
receive their own acid rain allowances.<p>
     The participation of these additional sources
will reduce the cost of achieving the 10 million ton
reduction in SO2 emissions mandated under the
Clean Air Act.  As participating sources reduce
their SO2 emissions at a relatively low cost, their
reductions -- in the form of allowances -- can be
transferred to electric utilities where emission
reductions are more expensive.<p>
     The Opt-in Program offers a combustion source
a financial incentive to voluntarily reduce its SO2
emissions.  By reducing emissions below its
allowance allocation, an opt-in source will create
unused allowances, which it can sell in the SO2
allowance market.  Opting in will be profitable if
the revenue from allowances exceeds the combined
cost of the emissions reduction and the cost of
participating in the Opt-in Program.<p>

<a href="optin/optin.html">The Opt-in Program</a>

<br><a name="impetus"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Pollution Prevention</h3>
<hr>

 The allowance trading system contains an inherent incentive for utilities to prevent pollution, since
for each ton of SO2 that a utility avoids emitting, one fewer allowance must be retired. Utilities that reduce emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy are able to sell, use, or bank their surplus allowances.  As also provided in the
Act, EPA has set aside a reserve of 300,000 allowances to stimulate energy efficiency and renewable energy generation. Those
utilities that either implement demand-side energy conservation programs to curtail emissions or
install renewable energy generation facilities may be eligible to receive extra allowances from this
reserve.<p>

<a href="crerqa.html">Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve</a>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>The NOx Program</h3>
<hr>

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set a goal of reducing NOx by 2 million tons from 1980 levels.  The Acid Rain program focuses on one set of sources that emit
NOx, coal-fired electric utility boilers.  As with the SO2 emission reduction requirements, the
NOx program is implemented in two phases, beginnning in 1996 and 2000.<p>
The NOx program embodies many of the same principles of the SO2 trading program in
its design: a results-orientation, flexibility in the method to achieve emission reductions, and program
integrity through measurement of the emissions.  However, it does not "cap" NOx emissions as the SO2 program does, nor does it utilize an allowance trading system. <p>
Emission limitations for the NOx boilers provide flexibility for utilities by focusing
on the emission rate to be achieved (expressed in pounds of NOx per million Btu of heat input).  Two options for compliance with the emission limitations are provided:
<ul>
     <li>compliance with an individual emission rate for a boiler
     <br>
     <li>averaging of emission rates over two or more units to meet an overall emission rate limitation<BR>                                                                                                                                                                                  
            (Note:  these units must have the same owner or operator)
</ul>
These options give utilities flexibility to meet the emission limitations in the most
cost-effective way and allow for the further development of technologies to reduce the cost of
compliance.<p>
If a utility properly installs and maintains the appropriate control equipment designed to
meet the emission limitation established in the regulations, but is still unable to meet the limitation, the NOx program allows the utility to apply for an alternative emission limitation (AEL) that corresponds to the level
that the utility demonstrates is achievable.<p>
Phase I of the program, which was delayed a year due to litigation, is now scheduled to begin on
January 1, 1996, and will affect two types of boilers (which are among those already targeted for Phase I SO2 reductions): dry-bottom wall-fired boilers and tangentially fired boilers.  Dry-bottom wall-fired boilers must meet a limitation of 0.50 lbs of NOx per mmBtu averaged over the year, and tangentially fired boilers must achieve a limitation of 0.45 lbs of NOx per mmBtu per year.  Approximately 170 boilers must comply with these NOx performance standards during Phase I. <p>

The regulations governing the Phase II portion of the program are under development.  By January 1, 1997, EPA may issue regulations revising the limitations for dry-bottom wall-fired and tangentially fired boilers first subject to NOx limitations in Phase II and regulations covering the remaining types of coal-fired boilers.<p>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Emissions Monitoring and Reporting</h3>
<hr>

Under the Acid Rain Program, each unit must continuously measure and record its emissions of
S02, NOx, and CO2, as well as volumetric flow and opacity.  In most cases, a continuous emission monitoring (CEM) system must be used.  There are provisions for initial equipment certification procedures, periodic
quality assurance and quality control procedures, recordkeeping and reporting, and procedures for
filling in missing data periods.  Units report hourly emissions data to EPA on a quarterly basis.  This data is then recorded in the Emissions Tracking System, which serves as a repository of emissions data for the utility industry.  The emissions monitoring and reporting systems are
critical to the program. They instill confidence in allowance transactions by certifying the existence
and quantity of the commodity being traded and assure that NOx averaging plans are working.  Monitoring also ensures, through accurate
accounting, that the SO2 and NOx emissions reduction goals are met.<p>

<a href="cems/cemlng.html">Continuous Emissions Monitoring</a>

<br><a name="emission"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Excess Emissions</h3>
<hr>

 If annual emissions exceed the number of allowances held, the owners or operators of delinquent units must pay a penalty of
$2,000 (adjusted for inflation) per excess ton of SO2 or NOx emissions. In addition, violating utilities must offset the excess SO2
emissions with allowances in an amount equivalent to the excess. A utility may
either have allowances deducted immediately or submit an excess emissions offset plan to EPA
that outlines how these cutbacks will be achieved.<p>

<br><a name="desigrep"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Designated Representatives</h3>
<hr>

 Each source appoints one individual, the Designated Representative, to represent the owners and
operators of the source in all matters relating to the holding and disposal of allowances for its
units that are affected by the Clean Air Act. The Designated Representative is also responsible for
all submissions pertaining to permits, compliance plans, emission monitoring reports, offset plans,
compliance certification, and other necessary information.  A source may appoint an Alternate Designated Representative to act on behalf of the Designated Representative.<p>

<br><a name="permits"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Permitting</h3>
<hr>

 The Designated Representative for each source is required to file a permit application for the
source and a compliance plan for each affected unit at the source. The Acid Rain permits and compliance
plans are simple, allow sources to fashion a compliance strategy
tailored to their individual needs, and foster trading. For example, they
allow sources to make real-time allowance trading decisions through the use of automatic permit
amendments.<p>   
 The permits stipulate the initial allowance allocation for each affected unit at a source. Permit applications must certify that each unit account will hold a sufficient number of allowances to cover
the unit's S02 emissions for the year, will comply with the applicable NOx limit, and will monitor and report emissions.  Permits are subject to public comment before approval.<p>
For more information, see 
<a href="permit.html">Permits</a>

<br><a name="options"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Compliance Options:  Freedom to Choose</h3>
<hr>

 The Acid Rain Program allows sources to select their own compliance strategy. For example, to
reduce SO2 an affected source may repower its units, use cleaner burning fuel, or reassign some
of its energy production capacity from dirtier units to cleaner ones.  Sources also may decide to reduce electricity generation by adopting conservation or efficiency measures.
Some of the options afford the unit special treatment, such as a compliance extension or extra
allowances. Most options, like fuel switching, require no special prior approval, allowing the source to respond quickly to market conditions without needing government approval.  For NOx, the source may meet the performance standard on a utility-unit basis, enter into an emissions averaging plan, or apply for an alternative emissions limitation.<p>
In either case, the program allows affected utilities to combine these and other options in ways
they see fit in order to tailor their compliance plans to the unique needs of each unit or system.<p>

<br><a name="model"></a>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>A Model Program</h3>
<hr>

 EPA gained broad input into the
development of the Acid Rain Program by consulting with representatives from various stakeholder groups, including utilities, coal and gas
companies, emissions control equipment vendors, labor, academia, Public Utility Commissions,
state pollution control agencies, and environmental groups.<p>
 EPA is maintaining this open door policy as it implements the program, and it continues to solicit
ideas from the numerous and diverse individuals and groups interested in acid rain control. In
addition, EPA is collaborating with groups who wish to evaluate the benefits and effects of the program through economic and
environmental studies.<p>
 The Acid Rain Program is already being viewed around the world as a prototype for tackling
emerging environmental issues. The allowance trading system capitalizes on the power of the
marketplace to reduce SO2 emissions in the most cost-effective manner possible.  The permitting
program allows sources the flexibility to tailor and update their compliance strategy based on their
individual circumstances. The continuous emissions monitoring and reporting systems provide the accurate accounting of emissions
necessary to make the program work, and the excess emissions penalties provide strong incentives
for self-enforcement. Each of these separate components contributes to the effective working of
an integrated program that lets market incentives do the work to achieve cost-effective emissions
reductions.  The General Accounting Office recently confirmed the beneftis of this approach, projecting that the allowance trading system could save as much as $3 billion per year -- over 50% -- compared with a command and control approach typical of previous environmental protection programs.<p>
