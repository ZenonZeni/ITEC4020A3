In the decade from 1981/82 to 1990/91 expenditure by Victorians
on their police force has increased by 135.3%, exceeding the CPI
inflation rate for the same period by 27.9%.
<P>
At the beginning of this decade, the Victorian Police program
outlays were $235,707,000.  By the end of the decade they had
reached $554,505,000, an increase of almost $319,000,000.
<P>
This represents an average of $31.9 million additional expenditure
on police by Victorians each year for the past 10 years.
<P>
At a time of increasing concern about the operation and management
of Victoria Police, when the economy is in severe recession, unemployment
at its highest levels for 60 years, and amidst claims that the
State of Victoria is bankrupt, it is necessary to question whether
the increased expenditure on the Victoria Police can be justified
by the results achieved.
<P>
In terms of police manpower, Victorians have obtained an additional
1,612 police officers for their extra $319,000,000 outlayed in
1990/91.
<P>
This represents a 19.09% increase in police officers during the
decade.  In 1981/82 8,444 people held the special privilege, responsibility
and powers that Victorians give to their police officers.  By
1990/91 this number had grown to 10,056.
<P>
For each year in the past decade, Victorians have gained 161.2
additional police officers on average per year, at an average
yearly cost of $31.9 million.
<P>
On the basis of these figures, it can be seen that each additional
police officer has cost Victorians $197,890 per police officer
per year.  At an average annual price tag of nearly $200,000 per
year.  Any decision to increase police numbers must be very carefully
considered.
<P>
In 1981/82 policing cost each Victorian $59.38.  In 1990/91 we
each pay $125.56 per year for our police.  At the end of this
10 year period each one of us has to find an additional $66.18
each year to pay for our police force.  
<P>
In 1990/91 the Victorian Police spent 33.3% of their total budget
on Corporate Services.  In contrast, expenditure on local police
stations, known as Community Based Policing in the police budget,
represented 49.8% of total Expenditure with a further 1.38% being
spent on Operations Support Services.
<P>
Operation Support Services covers such things as the Firearms
Registry, State Bicycle Co-ordination, Neighbourhood Watch, Police
in Schools, Co-ordination of Community Policing Squads, child
exploitation investigation and family violence, as well as liaison
with ethnic Aboriginal and gay communities.  All of these items
shared 1.38% of Victoria Police expenditure in 1990/91.
<P>
Major crimes are dealt with under Program 591 and accounted for
8.11% of Victoria Police expenditure in 1990/91 under the heading
&quot;Crime Investigation&quot;.   Program 591 also deals with
Traffic and Operations Support which accounted for 7.41% of Victoria
Police expenditure in 1990/91.
<P>
Although much has been made of the supposed explosion in criminal
activity in our society, a study of the official crime statistics
kept by the Victoria Police actually reveals a substantially different
story.  In looking at these figures, we should also bear in mind
that there has been much criticism of the way in which police
in Victoria compile and define their crime statistics.  Victoria's
Attorney General, Mr Jim Kennan, was quoted in the &quot;Sunday
Age&quot; of 29 March 1992 as saying:  &quot;A major crime index
is a major problem.  It is extraordinarily misleading.
<P>
.....Police and criminal justice agencies had a vested interest
in creating the impression of a crime wave.....The temptation
is if you want more resources you play up the blood and violence.&quot;
<P>
If we put the arguments about the accuracy and reliability of
the Police Major Crime Statistics, and accept the fact that an
independent body has been created, the Bureau of Criminal Statistics,
to analyse and report on crime statistics in the future, we can
still see that the hysteria being generated around &quot;the crime
explosion&quot; is ill informed and misleading.
<P>
Relying upon the raw Victoria Police Major Crime Stats, we see
that there is an apparently large increase in major crime in the
decade from 1981/82 to 1990/91.  Total major crime reported to
the police in 1981/82 was 175,518 and in 1990/91 it was 320,604
(note that Victoria Police changed from calendar year to financial
year recording of crime statistics at the end of 1983).
<P>
This represents, without allowing for growth input relation, an
increase in major crime reported of approximately 83% over the
decade.
<P>
However, if we look at the last five years of the decade from
1986/87 to 1990/91, we will see that the total major crime reported
to the Victoria Police has increased by only 13.02%.  Total major
crime reports in 1986/87 was 283,666 and in 199091 it was 320,604.
 This increase does not allow for growth in population.
<P>
By allowing for increases in population growth, based on information
provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for Victoria,
the major crimes reported to Victoria Police increased from 44.2
per every thousand people in 1981/82 to 72.6 per every thousand
people in 1990/91.  This represents a 64.25% increase in major
crime reported per capita over the 10 year period.
<P>
However, if we look at the last five years of the decade, we will
see that there has been an increase of only 7.07% in major crimes
reported to police in Victoria, allowing for a growth in the population.
<P>
In anyone's terms, an increase of just over 7% in major crimes
reported to police over the last five years hardly represents
a major blowout in criminal activity as many would have us believe.
<P>
If we turn to the issue of major crimes committed against persons,
we can see that at the end of the decade, 1990/91, in a crowd
of 100,000 at the MCG to watch the grand final, only 157 are likely
to have been the victims of some form of violent crime during
the previous 12 months.  The players on the other side of the
fence would almost certainly have had a much greater chance of
serious physical injury as a result of playing football for the
past 12 months.
<P>
The number of major crimes against the person have risen from
4,010 in 1981/82 to 6,946 in 1990/91.  By allowing for the increase
in Victoria's population over the decade, this represents an increase
of approximately 55% over the 10 year period.
<P>
However, if we look at the last five years from 1986/87, we will
see that the increase in major crimes against the person has been
only 12.14% allowing for population increase in the five year
period.  Again this cannot be seen in anyone's terms as a major
crime explosion.
<P>
Although it is of no consolation for those people who are the
victims of major crime against the person, the fact is that those
crimes represent only 2.16% of all major crime, as defined by
the Victoria Police, reported during 1990/91.  As a percentage
of all offences reported to police during 1990/91, these major
crimes against the person were only 1.57% of the total.
<P>
In contrast to major crimes against the person, very minor offences
(defined as &quot;other offences&quot; in police crime statistics)
represented 27.14% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91,
up from 24.01% in 1986/7.  Allowing for population increase, minor
offences have increased from 21.4 offences per 1,000 people in
1986/7 to 27.0 offences per 1,000 people in 1990/91.  This represents
a 26.16% increase in minor offences in real terms during this
period.  This is more than four times the increase in &quot;major
crime&quot; for the same period.  Victoria is experiencing a major
blowout in minor offences and not a crime wave.
<P>
Stealing, not including burglary and theft of motor vehicles,
represented 30.21% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91.
 The second largest category of all offences reported to police
was &quot;other offences&quot; (summary offences ranging from
indecent language through to resist police and bill posting) which
represented 27.14% of all offences reported in 1990/91.
<P>
Thus nearly 60% of all offences reported to police in 1990/91
related to either minor summary offences or allegations of stealing.
<BR>

<P>
<b>The big four in terms of number of offences reported to Victorian Police in 1990/91 were:</b>
<pre>
1. Theft          - 30.21% of total offences reported.
2. Other Offences - 27.14% "    "      "       "
3. Burglary       - 21.39% "    "      "       "
4. Fraud          - 11.55% "    "      "       "
</pre>
The big four represent 9 out of 10 of all offences reported to
the Victoria Police in 1990/91.
<P>
Another disturbing aspect of police response to crime in Victoria
is the very high over representation of juveniles (defined as
persons aged 8-16 years) in the figures for those people taken
to court for major offences.  
<P>
In 1990/91 juveniles represented 26.57% of all offenders proceeded
against in the major crime classification, and yet represented
only 11% of the population of Victoria.
<P>
In relation to minor offences, juveniles represented 11.83% of
those proceeded against which corresponds to their representation
amongst the general population.
<P>
The over-representation of juveniles proceeded against in relation
to &quot;major crime&quot; is more concerning when recognition
is given to the fact that juvenile criminal activity is largely
in the area of minor property offences and not major property
offences or offences against the person.
<P>
These figures suggest that police are targeting young people who
are highly visible, easy to apprehend and obtain convictions against
whilst ignoring serious crime and those responsible for it.
<P>
Far from living in a violent society, these figures tell us that
people are committing crimes out of either need or greed.  Given
the high levels of unemployment, the depth of the current recession
and the general gloominess being experienced by Victorians today,
it is reasonable to suppose that need is playing a large part
in the level of criminal offences being reported to police.<BR>
