<h1 align=center>GLOSSARY</h1>


<P><b>Affective Illness:</b> Disorder(s) of mood and affect with
associated vegetative symptoms producing discomfort and
maladaptation-malfunction (see below for various patterns).</P>
 
<P><b>Bipolar disorder:</b> Classic manic-depressive disease characterized
by discrete periods of depression and mania interspersed with well states. 
Cyclothymia: Chronic, long-standing (greater than one year) state of
hypomanic/ hyperactivity with moment to moment, day to day (mixed days) of
both manic and depressive moods and feelings with no prolonged, stable
(well) states. 

<P><b>Depression:</b> A discrete period of symptoms persisting for more
than 34 weeks and associated with poor functioning either at work
(school), home, or in play. The two major symptoms are: 1)dysphoric mood
characterized by both statements and appearance of sadness, unhappiness,
pessimism, loneliness with associated moodiness and often being difficult
to please; and 2) low self-worth (self-deprecation/poor self-esteem):
feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, and being dumb, stupid, ugly, or
guilty, along with beliefs of persecution, death wishes, and suicidal
thoughts. Four or more of the following symptoms are usually present
during the depressive episode:
<dl>
<dd>agitation
<dd>insomnia
<dd>lowered school performance
<dd>diminished socialization (or change to an unacceptable social group)
<dd>loss of interest in school, physical complaints
<dd>loss of usual energy and dropping out of usual fun, sport, or
aesthetic activities
<dd>change in appetite or weight. 
</dl>
Depending upon the number of symptoms and severity of malfunctioning,
depression is characterized as either "minor" or "major". 

<P><b>Dysthymia:</b> (chronic minor depression) Chronic. long standing
(greater than one year) depressive moods and feelings (dysphoria) along
with variable vegetative symptoms of insomnia, low energy, and decreased
interest that fluctuates in the pattern of mixed days with occasional "all
bad" days, but with no prolonged, stable (well) states. 

<P><b>Dysthymia With Bipolar Features:</b> Dysthymia with brief, recurrent
"moments" (periods) of hostile anger. 

<P><b>Hypomania:</b> (Chronic hypomanic/hyperactivity) Persistent
hyperactivity with inappropriate cheerfulness, silliness, giddiness,
intrusiveness, and interruptive-disruptive behavior. Racing thoughts with
push of speech, inappropriate, provocative sexual activity, irritable
moods, and decreased need for sleep can become apparent in older children
(ages 3-8 years). 

<P><b>Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder (JRCBD):</b> Chronic, long
standing (greater than one year) moment to moment or day to day (mixed
days) fluctuations of both manic and depressive moods and feelings with no
prolonged, stable (well) states but without any evidence of chronic
hypomanic/ hyperactivity. 

<P><b>Mania:</b> The hallmark of mania is two symptoms: 1) euphoria (most
commonly a total denial of any problems as one is disrupting the
environment and life of others and/or inappropriate feeling of
well-being); and 2) rages, hostile anger (ire) that can be associated with
homicidal thoughts and statements. An episode of mania is characterized by
these two symptoms persisting for a period greater than 1-2 weeks along
with the symptoms and behaviors of hypomania. Associated with these
symptoms, there must be malfunctioning in three environments of school,
home, and play. (Occasionally the individual will have malfunctioning in
only one or two of the environments.) 

<P><b>Manic-depressive Disease (Classic Bipolar Disorder):</b> Episodes of
depression persisting for more than 2-4 weeks and mania persisting for
more than 1-2 weeks interspersed with long periods (months or years) of
stable (well) states. 

<P><b>Primary Disorder of Vigilance:</b> A dominantly inherited condition
characterized by loss of alertness/wakefulness (vigilance) during
activities requiring continuous mental performance
(attention-concentration) or continuous task performance Individuals with
the Primary Disorder of Vigilance have a unique temperament: kind, caring,
affectionate, compassionate, and the inability to hold a grudge.
