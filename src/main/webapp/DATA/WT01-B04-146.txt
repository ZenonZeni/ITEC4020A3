<H3>Study cites marijuana as factor in increased crime and emergency room
episodes</H3>
<BR>
&quot;A substantial proportion of the US population has used illicit drugs,
resulting in increased risk of injury, disease, and death,&quot; (BA Rouse,
Clinical Chemistry 42:8(B) 1330-1336, 1996). From this perspective, Rouse
examined the National Institute of Justice Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) system
and two studies from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
i.e., the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the Drug Abuse Warning
Network (DAWN), to chart the role of illegal or nonmedical drug use in emergency
room episodes and interactions with the criminal justice system.<BR>
<BR>
The DAWN report showed marijuana use had increased significantly in all
age groups and that in emergency room treatment &quot;most marijuana related
episodes also included mentions of other drugs, particularly alcohol and
cocaine.&quot; Nonetheless, marijuana use alone was a significant factor
in emergency room visits.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary:</B> In the DUF study on the relationship between drugs and
crime it was noted that since an arrest may occur long after an offence
has taken place, determination as to whether or not drugs were a factor
is often minimised. Additionally, only the most serious offence for which
a person was booked was reflected. That being the case, it is highly likely
that drug offences are under reported.<BR>
<H3>Marijuana users incur Increased health care costs</H3>
<BR>
Marijuana smoke contains carcinogens and more tars than tobacco smoke. However,
little epidimeologic evidence has identifled marijuana smoking as a risk
factor for health. Polen et al (Westem Journal of Medicine, Vol. 158, pp
596601, 1993) studied the health effects of smoking<BR>
marijuana by comparing daily marijuana smokers who never smoked tobacco
(452 patients) with a demographically similar group of non-smokers of either
substance (450 patients). Daily marijuana smokers had a 19% increased risk
of out patient visits for respiratory illnesses, a 32% increased risk of
inury, and a 9% increased risk of other illnesses compared to non-smokers.
They also had a 50% increased risk of being admitted to the hospital. These
results were adjusted for sex, age, race, education, marital status, and
alcohol consumption.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>Daily marijuana smoking, even in the absences of tobacco,
appears to be associated with an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes,
including an excessive use of health care resources. Many marijuana smokers
also smoke tobacco and the adverse health consequences of using these two
substances together are likely to be multiplied. <BR>
<H3>Lung cancer causing carcinogen more prevalent in marijuana than tobacco</H3>
<BR>
A breakthrough report published in the journal Science, October 18, 1996,
provides the first true molecular evidence conclusively linking components
in tobacco smoking to lung cancer. A chemical found in tobacco smoking,
benzopyrene, causes genetic damage in lung cells that is identical to the
damage observed in the DNA of most malignant tumors of the lungs.<BR>
<BR>
Although scientists have been convinced in the past that smoking causes
lung cancer, the strong statistical associations did not provide absolute
proof. This paper absolutely pinpoints that mutations in lung cancer cells
are caused by benzopyrene. An average marijuana cigarette contains 30 nanograms
of this carcinogen compared to 21 nanograms in an average tobacco cigarette
(Marijuana and Health, National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine
report, 1982). This potent carcinogen suppresses a gene that controls growth
of cells. When this gene is damaged the body becomes more susceptible to
cancer. This gene, P53, is related to half of all human cancers and as many
as 70% of lung cancers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>Clearly marijuana smoke contains more of the potent carcinogen
benzopyrene than tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the technique of smoking marijuana
by inhaling deeply and holding the smoke within the lungs presents a chance
of much greater exposure than a conventional tobacco cigarette.<BR>
<H3>Marijuana interferes with brain's ability to metabolize glucose</H3>
<BR>
Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States, but
its short and long term effects on brain metabolism are not clearly understood.
Volkow et al (Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, Vol 67, pp 29-38, 1996)
studied brain glucose metabolism in daily marijuana users at baseline and
during marijuana intoxication. They used the sophisticated technique of
positron emission tomography (PET scan) which gives a visual picture of
the actively metabolizing brain.<BR>
<BR>
The results of eight chronic marijuana users were compared with age and
sex matched normal subjects. They found that THC, the main psychoactive
component of marijuana, produced lower glucose metabolism in the cerebellar
part of the brain. A single THC dose in a chronic user increases metabolism
in other specific parts of the brain. This does not occur in the non-using
controls. The activation of chemical metabolism pathways in the brains of
users, as compared to the controls, could lead to the drive and compulsion
to self-administer the drug observed in addicted individuals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>This sophisticated use of PET scanning which illustrates
individual regions of the brain and their abilities to metabolise glucose,
the main energy source of the brain, documents an abnormality in chronic
users of marijuana. The location of the abnormality in the cerebellum could
account for the motor defects and lack of coordination previously reported
in these subjects. This has obvious implications for public safety and operation
of motor vehicles by marijuana users. <BR>
<H3>Researcher calls for more studies of impact of marijuana on brain</H3>
<BR>
In an editorial (JAMA 996;275:521-527) Robert I. Block, Ph.D, discusses
a study by Pope &amp; Yurgelun-Todd in the same issue relative to marijuana
use and brain function. Dr. Block laments that there is &quot;so little
scientific information to communicate about adverse effects of chronic marijuana
use on human cognition or brain function&quot; He cites the Pope &amp; Yurgelun-Todd
study, which &quot;shows impairment in mental flexibility and abstraction,
as well as some aspects of leaming&quot; in frequent marijuana users, and
adds that &quot;With continued use of marijuana...the impairments might
increase over the years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Block notes that there is evidence of cognitive deficits &quot;persisting
for prolonged periods following cessation of marijuana use, consistent with
marijuana-induced brain alterations,&quot; and says that the recent increase
in marijuana use by US youth is a &quot;compelling motivation&quot; to conduct
more rigorous testing using the most modern detection techniques.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary:</B> The editorialist feels that far too few studies have
been done on this aspect of marijuana use and praised the Pope and Yurgelun-Todd
study for &quot;incorporating a rigorously supervised, 19-hour abstinence
period before testing.&quot; His suggestion that matched studies must be
done to measure intellectual ability prior to the onset of drug use is seemingly
impractical in that it would require being able to predetermine who would
use illicit drugs. However, more well designed and controlled studies in
this area would certainly be useful. <BR>
