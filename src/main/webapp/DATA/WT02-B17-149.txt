<h2>Private Sector Involvement in Biomass Energy</h2>
The Biomass Power PRogram, in collaboration with the Electric Power Research Institute 
(EPRI) and the DOE Biofuels Systems Program, is currently sponsoring ten feasibility 
projects which are cost-shared 50/50 with private industry. Under these projects, 
industry teams are conducting feasibility studies and developing business plans focusing 
on the integrated use of energy crops for power production. These 10 projects are 
summarized in the table below.

<p>The Utility Biomass Energy Commercialization 
Association (UBECA) was formed in 1994 by electric utility and power producing members to 
"encourage the development of economical sustainable biomass resources and economically 
competitive technologies for the benefit of electric utilities, power producers, their 
customers and society."

<p>In many regions of Asia, India, Africa, Latin America and other developing areas, 
power demands are frequently in smaller increments and biomass resources are abundant, 
particularly biomass residues such as bagasse (from processing sugar cane), rice hulls, 
etc. As a result, biomass fuels are an excellent choice for electricity generation in the 
developing world, and their potential use creates significant export opportunities for 
U.S. technologies and component manufacturers.

<p>Other developed nations are exploring biomass resources and associated opportunities. 
Competitive international biomass advanced-power efforts currently underway include the 
World Bank's gasifier projects in Brazil, which will produce 20-30 megawatts of electric 
power, and the 6 megawatt Varnamo Biofio Project in Sweden.
