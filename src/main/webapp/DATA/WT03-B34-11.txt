Jordan verdict overturned


The decision in Jordan v.  Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power,
rendered in the utilities' favor in May 1994 after a Douglas
County Court jury trial (See EMF Keeptrack V.6, no.11, June 1,
1994), has been overturned by the Georgia Appeals Court.  The new
ruling reopens the case, but it is uncertain in which court the
case will be retried.

In the 1994 decision, the 11 person jury found that power line
electric and magnetic fields were not the proven cause of Nancy
Jean Jordan's non-Hodgkins lymphoma.  Judge David T.  Emerson
issued a directed verdict on the property devaluation portion of
the case, writing that power lines had not devalued the
plaintiff's property.

The plaintiff's attorney, Robert Shields of Doffermyre, Shields,
Canfield & Knowles in Atlanta, Georgia, brought an appeal
challenging the judge for permitting defense witnesses to present
hearsay evidence.  The witnesses in question were two doctors,
who testified that the consensus of the scientific community is
that electric and magnetic fields do not cause cancer.  The
appeals court agreed with the plaintiff, saying that the doctors
did not identify the community of experts and did not say how the
consensus was reached.  Douglas County Superior Court judge David
Emerson "committed reversible error" in allowing the testimony,
said the appeals court.  He did not err in dismissing counts of
trespass, nuisance and property damage claims.

The court also ruled that jurors for the new trial must be
screened, and might not be allowed to participate in the case if
they belong to Oglethorpe Power's membership cooperative,
Greystone Power.  In order to disqualify jurors, the plaintiffs
must prove a financial benefit will result from membership.
Georgia Power attorney Robert Pennington said he planned to
appeal the decision to the Georgia Supreme Court.

UK plaintiffs' legal aid reinstated


Three families in Britain who claim power lines caused their
children's leukemia have gained back the right to legal aid in
their cases against electric companies.  Ray Studholme, whose
13-year old Simon Studholme died of leukemia in 1992, told
reporters, "It's brilliant news.  Hopefully we well now be able
to bring this case to court."

The families, who live in Bolton, Birmingham and North Yorkshire,
were granted legal aid in 1993, but the aid was withdrawn this
summer after the National Grid and regional electric companies
appealed.  The High Court in London restored the aid December 9.
The case may take up to two years to come to trial.

Solicitor Martyn Day is representing the families.  Day is
well-known for taking on large companies over environmental
concerns.  After the recent decision, he told the press,
"Although I accept the legal right of the National Grid to try to
stop legal aid being granted, I think there is a moral issue here
and I believe it was quite wrong of them to try to prevent these
families taking these cases through to trial."

Each family is suing the electric companies for up to 100,000
pounds.

California PUC news release on cellular tower
emissions


The December 1 issue of EMF Keeptrack reported that the
California Public Utilities Commission had announced a policy on
RF/EMF from cellular towers.  Printed below is the full text of
that announcement.

"California Public Utilities Commission News Release 505 Van Ness
Avenue San Francisco, CA 94102- 3298 Contact:  Dianne Dienstein
415-703-2423

November 8, 1995

CPUC REMAINS WATCHFUL REGARDING RF/EMF FROM
CELLULAR TOWERS

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) today ordered
cellular utilities to identify and address public concerns about
potential health problems from electromagnetic field (EMF) and
radio-frequency (RF) exposure in siting and building new cellular
towers.  It urged cellular companies to site facilities away from
schools and hospitals, and to restrict access to sites with
warning signs and barriers.

The Commission's jurisdiction is limited to cellular towers and
related facilities - it does not regulate cellular phones.  The
federal Food and Drug Administration regulates RF emissions from
consumer/industrial devices and is looking into RF emissions from
hand-held cellular phones.

Due to public concern and scientific uncertainty regarding the
potential health effects of EMF exposure, the Commission examined
what steps should be taken to mitigate the health effects, if
any, of RF and EMFs from the 1,000 cellular facilities in
California.  It found no scientific link between EMFs and adverse
health effects on humans from cellular facilities.

A steering committee composed of one representative each from the
CPUC Commission Advisory and Compliance Division, CPUC Division
of Ratepayer Advocates, state Department of Health Services,
Cellular Carriers Association of California, and Citizens
Concerned About Telecommunications EMF held an EMF informational
workshop on July 21, 1993 for interested individuals and
organizations.  The workshop was videotaped for those who could
not attend.

The workshop report, included with the Commission decision today,
identified levels of cellular utilities' EMF and RF radiation
impacts, issues for further consideration and interim safety
measures.

The Commission will not adopt a specific numeric standard for
RF/EMF exposure associated with cellular facilities because it is
premature to do so given no scientific evidence of a definite
link between cellular facility EMF exposure and adverse health
effects.

However, as more scientific research is completed, commission
action may become necessary.  The CPUC Commission Advisory and
Compliance Division will keep track of cellular EMF/RF research
findings and information, advise the Commission if action is
needed to address them, and convene periodic workshops to share
that information with all interested parties."

RF Briefs: California


In Sherman Oaks, California, cellular service provider L.A.
Cellular and residents of the Granada Hills area are arguing over
the placement of a 62-foot antenna at the Patrick Henry Middle
School.  Los Angeles City Associate Zoning Administrator Horace
Tramel, Jr.  held a hearing concerning the tower and decided to
wait four weeks before issuing his ruling, giving the residents
and the company time to reach a compromise.  L.A.  Cellular has
offered to cover the antenna with a bark-like material to make it
less visible, but many residents are against any kind of antenna
at the school for health reasons.  The Los Angeles Unified School
District decided to lease the land to the company in August, in
exchange for $1200 per month, paid to the middle school.

In El Dorado County, the County Planning Commission vetoed a
special use permit for a cellular tower on a hill overlooking a
shopping center in Cameron Park.  Commissioner Brian Veit
explained, "We cannot make the finding that its use would not be
detrimental to the residents' health, safety and welfare or
injurious to the neighborhood."  Nextel Communications wanted to
build a three antenna station in a barn it would build on a
leased site in the residential area.  Antennas at the facility
would have been only 19-feet high.  Neighbors are worried about
the precedent such a facility would set, and real estate agents
told the commission that the plan for the facility had already
discouraged potential buyers.  The commission suggested that
Nextel apply to build a higher tower on a remote site, preferably
in a commercial area.

In Fair Oaks, controversy over cellular tower health effects
seemed to have died down.  A public meeting of the Planning
Advisory Council revealed no opposition to a Pacific Bell Mobile
Services plan to install a new 60-foot personal communication
system (PCS) tower.  PCS towers are smaller and must be placed
closer together than cellular phone towers.  The PCS system would
allow users with a "smart card" to insert the card into certain
devices, such as a phone, to transmit voice and wireless fax.
Operations should commence in the Fair Oaks area by January 1997.

Although public opposition was lacking, council members voiced
concerns about EMF and the visual impact of the planned
monopoles.  They postponed their recommendation on the matter
until a January 17 meeting.

RF Briefs: Florida


In Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, the city council voted in October
to allow communication towers to be built in planned development
areas, to restrict tower height to 400 feet and to require a
distance from homes of three times the tower height.  Tests may
be required once a year.  Residents of Palm Beach Country Estates
had hoped the council would require a distance of ten times the
tower height and testing four times a year.  Palm Beach
Communications has applied for permission to build three 500-foot
towers near the development.

RF Briefs:  New Jersey


In Pennsauken, New Jersey, cellular phone company Comcast
Metrophone withdrew a request for a zoning variance after about
60 citizens protested the plan to build a tower on the property
of the World Harvest Christian Center.  The announcement came at
the beginning of a public meeting September 28.  Comcast said it
would submit an application to build the tower in an area of the
township that is zoned industrial.  The World Harvest Christian
Center would have received $1200 a month for allowing the tower
to be built on its property.

In Clifton, the city council voted October 1 to reverse a zoning
board decision that would have allowed Bell Atlantic to build a
150-foot tower near Dianne Court and Allwood Road.  The proposed
site was one of two acceptable to Bell Atlantic.  The company's
first choice, a high-rise apartment building called Country Club
Towers, was previously rejected by the zoning board.  Tenants of
the apartment building were adamantly opposed the antenna because
of health concerns.

Bell Atlantic appealed the zoning board rejection but agreed to
drop the appeal in return for a favorable decision on the Allwood
Road site.  The city council overturned that decision on the
grounds that it was unfair to the Dianne Court/Allwood Road
residents, who are also concerned about health effects.  The
council also ruled that Bell Atlantic failed to show that it
could not find an alternate site.

An attorney representing Bell Atlantic said the company examined
all possible commercial sites and found only two it could use.
Although the two sites are commercially zoned, they are within
500 feet of homes.  Attorney Greg Czura explained, "This carrier
must serve this area by its FCC license.  We have to build
something here to provide adequate service."

In Ringwood, New Jersey, a public hearing on a joint NYNEX/Bell
Atlantic application had to be continued from September 28 to
October 23 because too many people wanted to speak out against
the project.  The two companies want to build three 60-foot
towers near the clubhouse of the Erskine Lakes Property Owners
Association.  The towers would resemble flagpoles, complete with
flags.  Residents mentioned both health concerns and visual
concerns.  Rejecting the "flagpole" design, one resident said, "I
don't want the hilltop behind my house looking like a used-car
lot."  Others said the flagpoles would spoil the view from nearby
hiking trails.  At least one resident offered support for the
project, saying that lost hikers could use cellular phones to
call for help.

Members of the Erskine Lakes Property Owners Association were
angry that negotiations for the tower siting were carried out
without their knowledge by the association's president.  NYNEX
and Bell Atlantic are seeking a zoning variance from use, height,
and rear setback regulations.

Also in Ringwood, a group of neighbors, led by artist Joel
Popadics, is lobbying for removal of a 100-foot cellular tower
built by AT&T last winter.  The group says there should have been
a public hearing before the tower was built at the Ambulance
Corps building.  It replaced an older tower and is wider and more
visible than the previous antenna.  Borough officials agreed
there should have been a hearing and have promised to hold one.
LINE RF Briefs:  New York .TEXT In Greenburgh, New York, town
officials took a proactive approach to cellular siting concerns,
meeting with residences and telecommunications company
representatives from NYNEX to draft a zoning ordinance.  The new
ordinance is based loosely on similar laws passed in Seattle,
Washington, and Portland, Oregon, and covers the whole range of
antennas, from satellite dishes and television and radio
transmitters to cellular phone towers.

The draft ordinance was completed in September and forwarded to
the planning board for review.  NYNEX, AT&T Wireless and
community members all provided input.  The ordinance
distinguishes between receiving antennas and transmitting
antennas and restricts transmitting antennas to nonresidential
zones.  They must be 500 feet from a residential property line
and also 750 feet from schools, day-care centers and playgrounds.

NYNEX was pleased with the outcome, according to a New York Times
article.  An attorney representing the company explained, "If a
company can go in someplace as a matter of right, it would
probably prefer to do that than try to fight local zoning laws."

RF Briefs: Wisconsin


In the North Shore region of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, three towns
have been fighting cellular antenna plans.  Bayside, Whitefish
Bay and Fox Point have large numbers of residents concerned about
the potential health threat from towers.  According to cellular
phone companies, the North Shore has more cellular phones than
any other part of the Milwaukee area.  With the number expected
to double in a year, more antennas are badly needed.  The three
communities have all refused permits to Ameritech and Cellular
One since July 1995.  The cellular companies plan an educational
campaign and hope to enlist cellular phone users to help push for
the towers.

1995 DOE Contractor's Review: Final installment


In the last two issues of EMF Keeptrack summarized proceedings of
the 1995 Annual Review of Research on the Biological Effects of
Electric and Magnetic Fields from the Generation, Delivery & Use
of Electricity, sponsored by the US Department of Energy and
several other organizations.  In this final installment of our
report on the conference, we highlight the papers presented on
communications research and policy.  LINE 1995 Contractor's
Review:  Communications Research .TEXT Shari McMahan of the
School of Social Ecology, Environmental Health Sciences,
University of California at Irvine, presented study results on
how the content of EMF risk information influences public
attitudes.  McMahan and her colleague S.  Cornwell designed a
study in which 115 subjects read a low threat message and 136
subjects read a high threat message.  Subjects responded to
questions concerning personal attitudes and opinions about EMFs.
These questions were posed to participants 2 weeks later.  One
finding was that subjects in both groups said they would be least
likely to trust the news media, electric companies and friends
for balanced information about EMF.  They were most likely to
trust the American Medical Association, doctors, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and the State of California
Department of Health Services.  While researchers did find
significant differences in attitudes between the high risk and
low risk message groups, they caution the study population was
composed of college students and may not represent the general
population.

1995 Contractor's Review:  Policy Studies 


Martha McNeal of McNeal Consulting, West Palm Beach, Florida,
presented a talk on EMF policy options that local governments
could adopt.  She identified five basic policy options:  1) No
action, 2) Monitor research/provide information,
3)Setbacks/buffers, 4) Numerical limits, and 5)Prudent
avoidance/reduction.  Arguing that setbacks, buffers and
numerical limits can create economic burdens for property owners
and communities, McNeal recommended that communities adopt
flexible strategies which support prudent avoidance or reduction
and monitoring research.  She warned that setbacks, buffers and
numerical limits would erode the value of some existing
properties thereby eroding the community's tax base.  During a
question-and- answer period, Cindy Sage of Sage Associates
vehemently disagreed with McNeal's recommendations, saying they
were suited more to utilities than to local government.  She also
said that McNeal's conclusions about property equity were
inconsistent with the conclusions of the California EMF Consensus
Group.

H.  Keith Florig of Resources for the Future, Washington, DC,
discussed risk perception and the reasons policy makers either
regulate or do not regulate suspected environmental hazards.  To
study this, he looked at quantitative and qualitative features of
EMF risk compared to risk from other known or suspected hazards.
Looking at the epidemiological studies of children in very high
current configuration homes, he found that the risk of cancer
estimated from these studies would identify EMF as a worse killer
of children than automobile accidents or fire, and would suggest
that EMF should be regulated.  However, the magnitude of risk is
not the most important factor in the public's perception of EMF
risk, according to Florig.  Other more important factors appear
to be the distribution across different groups of risk, benefit
and control costs and trust in policy making institutions.  When
children are involved, or when people feel they are bearing an
unfair risk burden, EMF concerns become more acute.

Critical review of power frequency-cancer link


A review paper published in the Proceedings of the Society for
Experimental Biology and Medicine examines evidence of an
association between power-frequency electric and magnetic fields
and cancer.  John Moulder of the Radiation Oncology Department of
the Medical College of Wisconsin and Kenneth R.  Foster of the
Bioengineering Department of the University of Pennsylvania first
summarize what is known about the biophysics of power frequency
(50-60 Hz) fields, then examine the epidemiological and
laboratory studies.  They conclude evidence for power-frequency
fields being carcinogenic is extremely weak.

The authors contend that the scientific community, in general,
agrees there is no danger of cancer from power- frequency fields.
"There is, then, a broad consensus in the scientific community
that no causal association has been established between
residential and occupational exposure to power-frequency fields,
and the risk of cancer."  They argue the controversy in
scientific circles is limited to whether a link may be
established in the future and what kind of studies are most
important to do now.

The authors give suggestions for future studies and predictions
on the potential impact of a positive or negative finding.
Outcomes most likely to put the controversy to rest might be the
identification of a confounder in the childhood
leukemia-wirecoding studies, or an unsuspected alternative
carcinogen in the studies of electrical occupations.  Studies
most in need of replication, they claim, are the positive reports
of tumor promotion in chemically-induced breast cancer (D.S.
Beniashvili, Cancer Letters, V.61, p.75-79, 1991, and W.
Loscher, Cancer Letters, V.71, p.75-81, 1993) and the reports of
genotoxicity enhancement (M.  Rosenthal, Mutation Research,
V.210, p.329-335, 1989, and D.E.  Hintenlang,
Bioelectromagnetics, V.14, p.545-551, 1993).

Car interference worries needless, say UK experts


Today's cars are thoroughly tested for electromagnetic
interference problems, a British expert told the press in
October, after a media scare over potential mobile phone
interference with brakes.  Large manufacturers test cars in EMC
(electromagnetic compatibility) chambers, bombarding them with
radio waves from 10 kHz to 1 GHz to simulate exposure to anything
from defense installations to mobile phones.  Ian Simmons,
project director of the UK's Transport Research Laboratory (TRL)
claims, "I know of no case where any mobile phone has caused
interference of a nature to threaten a car's electronic systems."

Design changes have ruled out most interference with cars'
electronics, according to the TRL.  A few exceptions can occur,
however, such as when a car passes a highly active microwave
tower or high-powered transmitters and receivers used by police
and emergency personnel.

New European Community rules on electromagnetic compatibility (as
of January 1, 1996) apply to vehicles and require manufacturers
to use certain test methods and meet certain standards.  Industry
officials say the car makers have been following the new rules
for some time and that the European directives actually grew out
of standards set by car companies.  Aftermarket equipment might
not have to comply with the new rules until 2002.

As for mobile phones, Ian Simmons told reporters that portable
phones not designed for car use could induce high fields, but
because they would not be brought close to the car's electronic
equipment, they should not cause a problem.

New European EMC regulations take effect


Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is now the law for products
sold or installed in the member nations of the European Union.
Beginning January 1, 1996, manufacturers of electrical equipment
must meet a new set of standards to receive the "CE Mark" showing
conformance with all European safety requirements.  The new EMC
directives say that equipment must not cause undesirable
radiation, and it cannot be susceptible to the effects of
unwanted electromagnetic radiation.  The regulations are not
aimed at reducing health concerns, but at ensuring that various
devices will operate smoothly together.  Health concerns arise in
some situations, however.  Hospital equipment, wheelchairs,
automobile control systems and industrial equipment potentially
can be affected by electromagnetic interference.  Less life
threatening, but important, are the effects of interference on
computers and broadcasting.

For US manufacturers, this means that any product meant for
export to Europe must be certified electromagnetically
compatible.  The standards for telecommunications equipment are
said to be more clear than those for other electrical devices,
and some experts advise companies to contract for outside testing
by a "competent body" such as Underwriters' Laboratories.
According to the European Union rules, "competent bodies" are
selected by a national "notified body", currently the US
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Most manufacturers are prepared for the new regulations, which
have been widely publicized.  Another set of requirements will
come into effect on January 1, 1997, requiring the use of
"low-voltage components."

Hong Kong government considering alternative
routes for troubled power line


Legislators planned to discuss five alternative routes for a
controversial 400-kV transmission line in mid- December, but a
satisfactory compromise appears remote.  Utility company China
Light and Power (CLP) nearly has completed the power line along
the original route and says it must begin construction on the
final section over Yick Yuen village in order to supply needed
electricity on schedule.  Residents of the area are accusing the
utility and government officials of delaying their consideration
of alternative routes in order to finish the line, even though
the Legislative Council (LegCo) ordered in April 1995 that a new
route be chosen to avoid coming close to homes.

A government spokeswoman told the press that each of the five
alternatives submitted by citizens' groups was flawed.  Two pass
close to housing, one poses technical problems because it crosses
a road, one passes through a village and over a church, and one
goes through the Ho Chung valley, which is designated as a site
of special scientific interest.  Legislators have said the line
should be routed through a park area to avoid proximity to homes.
