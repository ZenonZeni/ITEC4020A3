<b>&quot;SCENTED OIL&quot; MONOI TAHITIAN COSMETICS</b><p> 
For centuries, Tahitians have used a multi-purpose natural cosmetic formula called Monoi to keep their skin from dehydrating under the tropical conditions of strong, continuous sunlight. Tahitians and other Polynesians reportedly used this formula to protect their bodies from the elements during the long oceanfaring expeditions of an earlier age. According to Tahitian lore, newborn infants were covered with Monoi from head to toe to protect against dehydration during especially hot weather.<p>
Today, Monoi based on this traditional Tahitian formula is available in the U.S. as part of a body-care line that includes bath and shower gels, tanning lotions, skin balm, moisturizer, body cream, and a beauty bar soap. According to the manufacturer, Monoi and Cosmetics, all products are chemical free and no animal testing is involved; in addition, in 1992, the French government awarded Monoi a special certification called "Guarantee of Origin," given only to products the government considers "superior" and of the "finest quality."<p>
The essence of the Monoi products is a combination of tiare flowers and oil from the fruit of the Tumu ha'ari tree (a variety of coconut), both native to Polynesia. According to the manufacturer, tiare flowers (Gardenia Tahitensis, a 6-petalled highly fragrant white blossom) are handpicked and immediately soaked in refined coconut oil (from native coconuts, refined without chemicals) for at least 15 days. <p>
"Laboratory tests show that the tiare flower has over 150 botanical attributes and acts as a natural barrier against dehydration," states a company representative. Customer testimonials collected by the company suggest that in addition to helping to produce soft and supple skin, the Monoi products have certain medicinal benefits such as reducing the symptoms of rashes, hair damage, and heel cracking, while aiding nail growth.<p>
The traditional Monoi recipe, reportedly still used, specifies a minimum of 15 tiare flowers per liter of refined coconut oil. During the extraction process (called enfleurage), the botanical and hydrating qualities of the tiare flower (and its perfume) are gradually released into the coconut oil, thereby constituting the basis of Monoi ("scented oil") products. The Monoi extract is then filtered and blended with other ingredients, such as vitamin E, aloe vera, African shea tree nut butter, or apricot oil to create the various body-care applications.<p>
According to an informal evaluation of selected Monoi products by a holistic practitioner known to the Digest, the Tahiti Smooth Shower Gel (which can be used instead of soap), "the skin-softening effect can be felt immediately, yet it is not a greasy sensation. The gel leaves a light, delicate, and pleasant fragrance yet it is not so overpowering as to dominate any perfumes or other scents used. The Pure Nurturing Body Cream has similar qualities, based on my experience with it."<p>

<b>GOOD HERBS FOR CLEANSING YOUR FACE</b><p>
An herbal face mask can draw toxins out of your skin while improving blood circulation to your face. Here is an herbal face mask from Chinese herb expert Andrew Gaeddert. He recommends mixing the following ingredients:<p>
<ul>
 <li>clay, 1 tablespoon<br>
 <li>water, 2 tablespoons<br>
 <li>clear honey, 1/2 teaspoon<br>
 <li>lavender oil, 1 drop<br>
 <li>geranium oil, 1 drop<br>
</ul>
Apply the mixture to your face; if your skin is dry, remove after 10 minutes; if oily, allow it to remain longer. To remove the mask, wipe your face with a cotton ball, presoaked in warm water.<p>
Here are simple ways to cleanse and moisturize your skin, based on a traditional Japanese method, according to skin-care expert Michelle Dominique Leigh:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Use your fingers to rub camellia tree oil on your face, then remove the oil using a gauze pad.<p>
 <li>Massage your face with a small cotton drawstring bag containing pure rice bran, presoaked in warm water. Rinse, then pat your face dry with silk.<p>
 <li>Apply loofah-vine water (made from the fresh sap of the loofah-vine plant, mixed with a tiny amount of sake as a preservative) by gently patting it on the face after washing; do not rinse it off; alternatively, use diluted brown rice vinegar.<p>
 <li>Grate a fresh cucumber and extract its juice by squeezing it through cheesecloth; apply the liquid to your face, then pat dry.<p>
 <li>Mix dry adzuki bean powder in a small silken or cotton bag, moisten, then use to scrub your face. Or, mix a little adzuki bean powder in the palm of your hand with water, then massage your face with the frothy cream.<p>
</ul>

<b>TIPS FOR CREATING HEALTHY SKIN</b><p>
Like any other system of the body, the skin needs care, especially the skin of your face which receives the most exposure to the environment. In addition to dietary considerations and supplements that build health from the inside out, there are steps you can take to care for your skin on the outside, too. Zia Wesley-Hosford, founder of Educated Beauty, a natural cosmetics and skin-care company, and author of Fifty and Fabulous, recommends the following daily "skin-care rituals" to keep your skin healthy and vibrant.<p> 
In the morning:<p>
<ul>
 <li><i>Cleanse and Exfoliate</i>. "Morning exfoliation [removing dead skin cells] is one of the most beneficial things you can do for aging skin and for repairing skin damage," says Wesley-Hosford. She suggests an exfoliating mask with clay, but says a facial cleanser can also be used. Cleansers should be matched to skin type (normal, oily, dry, or combination) and cleansing accomplished by massaging the face with the cleanser from bottom to top with circular motions of the fingertip pads for 1 minute, then splashing the face 20 to 30 times with warm water. Wesley-Hosford cautions that hot water dries out the skin. <p>
 <li>Treat the Eyes. Since the skin around the eyes cannot produce oil the way other skin can and is the thinnest on the body, it is the first place to show signs of age. Wesley-Hosford advises using a water-soluble moisturizer, particularly oxygenated, enzymatic, or liposome products because of their ability to penetrate the skin. Liposomes are composed of phospholipids (fats) which are a natural component of skin cells. The similarity in the cell membrane of liposomes and skin cells allows liposome to penetrate skin more deeply than other substances applied topically. <p>
   "Liposomes might be said to slip into the 'empty spaces' in the skin caused by dehydration and free-radical damage," explains Wesley-Hosford. "Once there, they 'melt' and release their contents of lipids slowly over a period of about 10 to 12 hours." Generally derived from the lecithin in egg yolks, liposomes are a relatively new addition to skin-care products. <p>
   To apply moisturizer to the eye area, use your middle finger, moving from the outside inward to keep from stretching the eye muscle. Avoid the inner corner of the eye since that is where the tear ducts are.<p>
 <li><i>Tone the Skin</i>. A facial skin toner "tightens the skin, helps reestablish the skin's pH after cleansing, protects, and nourishes." Toner can be applied with the fingertips or with a cotton ball. A spray toner can also be used and, in that case, massage the toner into the skin with the fingertips. <p>
 <li><i>Moisturize Your Face</i>. Wesley-Hosford recommends using a facial moisturizer containing "predigested oils." These products can penetrate skin that is not wet. Previously, skin had to be damp for moisturizers to penetrate. <p>
 <li><i>Screen Out the Sun</i>. Sunblocks should be matched to your skin type. Those with normal, oily, or combination skin will do best with an oil-free product. Those with dry skin should use an oil-based sunblock. Wesley-Hosford emphasizes the importance of using a sunblock whenever it is sunny outside and choosing one that has both UVA and UVB protection. She recommends an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 to 18. Rather than rubbing the block into the skin, which reduces its protection factor by about half, "lay" the lotion on evenly, letting it "sit" on the skin. Waterproof sunblocks can clog pores and are therefore not advised. <p>
</ul>
At night:<p>
<ul>
 <li><i>Cleanse</i>. Cleansing is important at the end of the day to remove whatever dirt and toxins may have accumulated. Follow the same procedure as the morning cleanse.<p>
 <li><i>Rejuvenate</i>. "Nighttime is the perfect time to help your skin regenerate because this is the time when skin cells renew themselves most actively," says Wesley-Hosford. However, she cautions against heavy creams. Recommended nighttime facial rejuvenators are vitamin A, E, and C elixirs, oxygenating moisturizers, and those that contain natural alphyhydroxy or betahydroxy acids. <p>
 <li><i>Moisturize</i> (optional). If no nighttime rejuvenator is used, it is advisable to use a moisturizer after cleansing. <p>
</ul>

<b>NATURAL COSMETICS ARE PREFERRED, SAY CONSUMERS</b><p>
When the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors conducted a nationwide consumer poll in 1992 to find out how American consumers regard the claim "natural" regarding cosmetics, 72% of the 1,800 respondents rated it as "very important." The survey also revealed that 49.4% said product claims for "natural" should mean a product is "all natural" and 23% said this claim can be stretched to mean a product is "mostly natural." 4.9% said the claim has no meaning or is purely an advertising ploy.<p>
