  This article reviews the legal basis of inclusion of students with 
disabilities in regular education settings, focusing on students with behavior 
disorders.  It examines case law and extrapolates principles from these cases, 
including the Daniel R. R. standard, the Rachel H. standard, and the Clyde K. 
and Sheila K. versus Puyallup School District case.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This reaction to Mitchell Yell (EC 611 140) contends that a trend toward 
judicially ordered least restrictive environment (LRE) placements for children 
with disabilities has begun.  School officials are urged to take a more active 
role in restructuring educational systems so that inclusion can become a 
reality.  If educators do not take the lead, the courts will.  (JDD)<BR>

  This paper examines four court decisions felt by some authors to represent 
judicial activism concerning least restrictive environment for students with 
disabilities.  The courts' reasoning and decision-making methods are discussed, 
and the paper concludes that there is no indication that the courts are ready 
to abandon precedence and begin substituting their judgments for educators' 
judgments.  (JDD)<BR>

  This review of legislation, including the Individuals with Disabilities

placement of students with disabilities in regular classrooms but, rather, 
fully supports the continuum of placements.  Principles extrapolated from these 
cases offer guidance to special educators making decisions regarding the least 
restrictive environment.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Progress in implementing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA) and recommendations to further promote its implementation via the 1995 
legislative reauthorization process are examined.  The purpose of the 
legislation and major court findings regarding its interpretation are discussed.  
Ten hearings conducted by the National Council on Disabilities, to elicit views 
of parents and students on the law's effectiveness and to gather 
recommendations for better implementation, are summarized, with testimony from 
witnesses in the following 10 theme areas: the "zero reject" provision of the 
law, assessment for eligibility and nondiscriminatory evaluation of students, 
providing for appropriate education, providing the least restrictive 
environment, parent participation in decision-making, procedural due process 
for students, services to transition students from school to activities after 
school, discretionary programs to help implement the law, provisions that 
determine the federal share of costs and how federal funds are allocated, and 
the 1994 federal educational reform law entitled the Educate America Act.  
Appendices include hearing dates, locations, participants and witnesses, and a 
synthesis regarding IDEA implementation based on 27 research papers.  (SW)<BR>

  Full inclusion is a confusing topic.  Many people misunderstand the "least 
restrictive environment" provision of the federal Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act.  Districts need not educate every disabled child in a regular 
classroom for the entire day, but have numerous options, so long as each child 
is carefully evaluated.  Recent lawsuits brought by parents of mentally 
retarded children support mainstreaming practices.  (MLH)<BR>

  During the early years of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA), the courts generally deferred to school officials on least restrictive 
environment (LRE) matters and ruled in favor of more restrictive placements.  
Recent cases may signal that the courts may be growing impatient with school 
officials for not providing less restrictive environments.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This paper analyzes three conflicting positions that constitute the Regular 
Education Initiative, in light of 24 federal and state court decisions.  It 
concludes that the "Little Change Model" complies with more of these standards 
(such as due process, equal access, and education quality).  The "Extreme 
Change Model" (which includes the concept of "full inclusion") appears to be 
least compliant.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  School administrators are caught between the special education requirements 
of a free appropriate education and the mainstreaming preference embodied in 
federal law.  This article analyzes circuit court cases and explains four 
overlapping judicial standards that influence mainstreaming decisions.  
Administrators should avoid blanket-separation and full-inclusion models and 
make individualized placement decisions honoring the least restrictive 
environment concept.  (Contains 45 references.) (MLH)<BR>

  This theme issue provides guidance on school district compliance with the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in the inclusion of students 
with disabilities.  It provides a summary and analysis of four recent decisions 
in federal appellate courts, which all affirmed the right of students with 
significant disabilities to attend regular education classes full time when the 
educational benefits for the individual student warrant such a placement.  The 
cases are: "Daniel R.R. v. State Board of Education," "Greer v. Rome City 
School District," "Oberti v. Board of Education of the Borough of Clementon 
School District," and "Sacramento City Unified School District v. Rachel 
Holland," and were decided upon by the Fifth, Eleventh, Third, and Ninth 
Circuit Courts, respectively.  Consistent across all the decisions is the 
holding that, before denying a student the opportunity to be in an inclusive 
setting, school districts must demonstrate that placement in the regular class 
with appropriate support services and supplementary aids will not provide 
benefit for the student.  It is also noted that the U.S.  Supreme Court has 
denied review of the Holland decision, suggesting that these appellate court 
decisions will be the standard for some time to come.  (DB)<BR>
