<H2>OXYGEN FOR LIFE - 
<BR>The Fast Way to Deliver <A NAME="Oxygen">Oxygen</A> to Your Cells</H2>

A new line of products from Oxygen for Life addresses two crucial problems regarding
nutritional supplementation and good health. First, according to the Physicians' Desk
Reference, if you take a multivitamin pill or tablet, your body will probably absorb no more
than 15-25% of the nutrients; but if you introduce these same nutrients in a colloidal,
suspended form, your absorption rate climbs to 80-95%.

<P>Second, nobody is getting enough oxygen into their body these days because there
literally is less of it around, as atmospheric oxygen has declined from 35% to 19% in the
last century, not to mention the pollution factor which also blocks oxygen availability.
Oxygen for Life, under the direction of its founder, Richard Breitbarth, Ph.D., developed a
way to deliver more oxygen to all the body's cells both faster and in a much more absorbable
way.

<P>The system is called Micro-Activation and it's based on the principal of colloidal
suspension, which is the natural state of your blood. "Colloidal" means this: instead of
dropping a marble into a tumbler of water, pulverize it into a thousand pieces and stir it
up-this is a colloidal suspension of marble with many tiny particles of the substance adrift
in the liquid. The same can be done with nutrients. Dr. Breitbarth devised a way to optimize
the electrical properties of water and minerals so that the human body could absorb the
maximum number of nutrients at the fastest rate. The nutrients, in effect, bypass the normal
stages of digestion and enter the bloodstream more directly, enabling "penetration and
utilization at levels never before possible," states Dr. Breitbarth.
<P>The basis of the Oxygen for Life system comprises 5 products in a daily health program in
which you mix small amounts with pure or distilled water, then take orally. Oxygen Solution[TM]
provides high amounts of stabilized oxygen to aid all cellular processes, including toxin
removal. A typical dose is one teaspoon with 6 ounces of water, taken twice daily; an
8-ounce bottle, containing 48 teaspoons, will last about 24 days.
<P>Aqua-Charge<FONT SIZE=-2>[TM]</FONT> is an electrolyte concentrate that gives your red blood cells a
much-needed electrical boost. Aqua-Antioxidant[TM]  is a colloidal suspension of pine bark and
grape seed antioxidants (also known as pycnogenols) to remove free radicals from your body.
Aqua Colloidal C-Q-10[TM]  comprises coenzyme Q10, a substance that helps your red blood cells
carry oxygen and your body to absorb it.

symptoms.
<P>The reports from users are favorable. Oxygen for Life products. According to massage
therapist Jennifer Cohen of Encinitas, California, a patient who has suffered with chronic
arthritis for many years experienced a dramatic end to her pain after 8 days of taking the
basic 5 products twice daily. Then Cohen added Oxygen for Life's colloidal Mexican Wild Yam
and Shark Cartilage to the patient's daily mix (once daily, before bedtime) after which her
skin tone softened and she was able to walk on her own again, free from the motorized chair
she had depended on. Eventually, she was able to take a 3 week hiking trip, walking up to 3
miles every day, says Cohen.

<H2><A NAME="ARTHRITIS">ARTHRITIS</A> RELIEF-
<BR>Why Glucosamine May Be Your Joints' Best Nutritional Support</H2>

Osteoarthritis, or stiffness, pain, and degeneration in the joints, affects an estimated
one-half of the adult population and about 85% of those over age 70. The most common
treatments, analgesics and antiinflammatory agents, do not work on the underlying
degenerative process and often make the condition worse by interfering with cartilage
metabolism. However, since the 1980s, numerous studies have proven that a naturally-occuring
substance called glucosamine can effectively manage, even improve, the symptoms of
osteoarthritis, without any side effects. 
<P>Glucosamine is a substance normally present in the cartilage of the body's joints where
it is essential for physiological processes. Clinical studies, comparing glucosamine (in
sulfate or hydro-chloride form) with both placebo (a nonactive substance) and standard
arthritis drugs (including Ibuprofen), showed that glucosamine outperformed both in reducing
long-term pain, joint tenderness and swelling, and accelerating recovery, reversing
cartilage damage, and helping to restore joint function, range of motion, and walking speed.

<P>Glucosamine was rated "good" or "sufficient" by 95% of 1208 patients who used the
substance for arthritic pain control. In fact, it is "fully tolerated" by 85% of users, with
no irritation to the gastrointestinal tract. Further, glucosamine nearly doubled the speed
and magnitude of the improvement in the ease of movement and flexibility in joints. In no
study were any side effects or adverse reactions noted to the use of this food supplement in
daily amounts of 500 mg, divided into 3 doses. A year's supply (at 750 mg daily dosage)
costs about $175-$240, making it highly affordable.
<P>That's why European physicians felt no hesitancy in classifying glucosamine sulfate as a
"potential disease-modifying drug for long-term treatments of osteoarthritis and other
rheumatic disorders." In several countries, glucosamine is a first-line treatment for
osteoarthritis. Although most U.S. physicians have, strangely, ignored glucosamine, American
nutritionist M.F. McCarty contends that the substance "may offer a practical means of
preventing or postponing the onset of osteoarthritis in older people or athletes."

<H3>ACCURATE LAB TEST FOR <A NAME="DETECTING">DETECTING</A> EARLY CANCER - 
<BR>Boston's Oncolab Claims 95% Accuracy</H3>

Over the past 21 years, Massachusetts neurochemist Samuel Bogoch, M.D., Ph.D, has been
developing a new blood test to accurately detect early signs of cancer cells of all types in
the body. Although it was approved by the FDA in 1977, it was not until late 1994 that the
clinical trials with 4278 patients were completed, validating the test's effectiveness. Now
this patented, FDA-approved, Anti-Malignin Antibody Screen (AMAS) is available for doctors,
worldwide, through Dr. Bogoch's Oncolab. According to Dr. Bogoch, AMAS is 95% accurate on
the first test, and 99% when repeated; the test can detect cancer up to 19 months before
conventional medical tests can find it.

<BR>Contact: Oncolab, 36 The Fenway, Boston, MA 02215; tel: 800-922-8378; fax:
617-536-0657. The test costs $135 (followup, $85) and can be ordered by any physician
who is licensed to order clinical lab tests.
<BR CLEAR=ALL></BLOCKQUOTE></CENTER></P><HR WIDTH=85%>

<P>AMAS screens for the earliest signs of all types of cancer and it can also monitor the
results of any treatment or assess the degree of remission. This means it can objectively
measure the effect of alternative cancer treatments in removing cancer from the body. It
also means lives can be saved because approximately 35% of people who die from cancer could
be saved with an earlier diagnosis followed by prompt treatment.
<P>The test is called an immunoassay, which means it measures the amount present of a
specific antibody, in this case, antimaligni. This is an antibody that acts against the
inner protein layer of a cancer cell, called malignin. According to Dr. Bogoch, 99% of
patients with cancer have AMAS readings above 135. The advantage of the new blood test,
states Dr. Bogoch, is that it "gives a much more accurate answer at a fraction of the cost
and inconvenience" of standard cancer tests. 
<P>When the last malignant cancer cells are destroyed in the body, the antimalignin antibody
levels return to normal, proving the cancer is cured. In fact, a new study by Bogoch
involving 1175 breast cancer patients proved that clinical remission, whether it's after one
or 30 months, is directly correlated with normal AMAS levels.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>German researchers found that pregnant women's mercury 
dental amalgams are directly associated with high levels of mercury in their fetuses.
The more mercury-based fillings, the higher the levels in the livers of the unborn.
The women in the study did not have a history of high mercury exposure from their job
or fish eating. German doctors urged reconsideration of the use of mercury amalgams
for women during their child-bearing years.</B></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
