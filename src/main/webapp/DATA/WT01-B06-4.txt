<h1><strong>Gottschalk v. Benson </strong></h1>
Supreme Court of the United States<br>
409 U.S. 63<br>
1972
</center>

<p>Mr. Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of
the Court.

<p>Respondents filed in the Patent Office an application for an invention
which was described as being related ``to the processing of data by
program and more particularly to the programmed conversion of
numerical information'' in general-purpose digital computers.  They
claimed a method for converting binary-coded decimal (BCD) numerals
into pure binary numerals.  The claims were not limited to any
particular art or technology, to any particular apparatus or
machinery, or to any particular end use.  They purported to cover any
use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital computer of any
type.  Claims 8 and 13<a name="F1"><a href="#FN1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a> were rejected by the Patent Office but sustained by the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, 441 F.2d 682. The case is here on
a petition for a writ of certiorari.  405 U.S. 915.
 
   The question is whether the method described and claimed is a
``process'' within the meaning of the Patent
Act.<a name="F2"><a href="#FN2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a>

<p>A digital computer, as distinguished from an analog computer, operates
on data expressed in digits, solving a problem by doing arithmetic as
a person would do it by head and hand.<a name="F3"><a href="#FN3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> Some of the digits are
stored as components of the computer.  Others are introduced into the
computer in a form which it is designed to recognize.  The computer
operates then upon both new and previously stored data.  The
general-purpose computer is designed to perform operations under many
different programs.
 
   The representation of numbers may be in the form of a time series
of electrical impulses, magnetized spots on the surface of tapes,
drums, or discs, charged spots on cathode-ray tube screens, the
presence or absence of punched holes on paper cards, or other devices.
The method or program is a sequence of coded instructions for a
digital computer.

<p>   The patent sought is on a method of programming a general-purpose
digital computer to convert signals from binary-coded decimal form
into pure binary form.  A procedure for solving a given type of
mathematical problem is known as an ``algorithm.'' The procedures set
forth in the present claims are of that kind; that is to say, they are
a generalized formulation for programs to solve mathematical problems
of converting one form of numerical representation to another.  From
the generic formulation, programs may be developed as specific
applications.

<p>The decimal system uses as digits the 10 symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, and 9.  The value represented by any digit depends, as it
does in any positional system of notation, both on its individual
value and on its relative position in the numeral.  Decimal numerals
are written by placing digits in the appropriate positions or columns
of the numerical sequence, <em>i. e.</em>, ``unit''
10<sup><fontsize=-2>0</fontsize></sup>, ``tens'' 10<sup><fontsize=-2>1</fontsize></sup>,
``hundreds'' 10<sup><fontsize=-2>2</fontsize></sup>, ``thousands'' 10<sup><fontsize=-2>3</fontsize></sup>, etc.  Accordingly, the
numeral 1492 signifies (1 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>3</fontsize></sup>) + (4 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>2</fontsize></sup>) + (9 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>1</fontsize></sup>) + (2 x 10<sup><fontsize=-2>0</fontsize></sup>).

<p>   The pure binary system of positional notation uses two symbols as
digits -- 0 and 1, placed in a numerical sequence with values based on
consecutively ascending powers of 2.  In pure binary notation, what
would be the tens position is the twos position; what would be
hundreds position is the fours position; what would be the thousands
position is the eights.  Any decimal number from 0 to 10 can
be represented in the binary system with four digits or positions as
indicated in the following table.

<p>  
   The BCD system using decimal numerals replaces the character for
each component decimal digit in the decimal numeral with the
corresponding four-digit binary numeral, shown in the righthand column
of the table.  Thus decimal 53 is represented as 0101 0011 in BCD,
because decimal 5 is equal to binary 0101 and decimal 3 is equivalent
to binary 0011.  In pure binary notation, however, decimal 53 equals
binary 110101.  The conversion of BCD numerals to pure binary numerals
can be done mentally through use of the foregoing table.  The method
sought to be patented varies the ordinary arithmetic steps a human
would use by changing the order of the steps, changing the symbolism
for writing the multiplier used in some steps, and by taking subtotals
after each successive operation.  The mathematical procedures can be
carried out in existing computers long in use, no new machinery being
necessary.  And, as noted, they can also be performed without a
computer.

<p>
   The Court stated in <em>Mackay Co.</em> v. <em>Radio Corp.</em>, 306 U.S. 86, 94,
that ``[w]hile a scientific truth, or the mathematical expression of it,
is not a patentable invention, a novel and useful structure created
with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be.'' That statement
followed the longstanding rule that ``[a]n idea of itself is not
patentable.'' <em>Rubber-Tip Pencil Co.</em> v. <em>Howard</em>, 20 Wall. 498, 507.
``A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original
cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in
either of them an exclusive right.'' <em>Le Roy</em> v. <em>Tatham</em>, 14 How. 156,
175.  Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes,
and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the
basic tools of scientific and technological work.  As we stated in
<em>Funk Bros. Seed Co.</em> v. <em>Kalo Co.</em>, 333 U.S. 127, 130, ``He who discovers
a hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no claim to a monopoly of
it which the law recognizes.  If there is to be invention from such a
discovery, it must come from the application of the law of nature to a
new and useful end.'' We dealt there with a ``product'' claim, while the
present case deals with a ``process'' claim.  But we think the
same principle applies.

<p>

<p>   Here the ``process'' claim is so abstract and sweeping as to cover
both known and unknown uses of the BCD to pure binary conversion.  The
end use may (1) vary from the operation of a train to verification of
drivers' licenses to researching the law books for precedents and (2)
be performed through any existing machinery or future-devised
machinery or without any apparatus.

<p>   In <em>O'Reilly</em> v. <em>Morse</em>, 15 How. 62, Morse was allowed a patent for a
process of using electromagnetism to produce distinguishable signs for
telegraphy.  <em>Id</em>., at 111. But the Court denied the eighth claim in
which Morse claimed the use of ``electro magnetism, however developed
for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at
any distances.'' <em>Id</em>., at 112. The Court in disallowing that claim said,
``If this claim can be maintained, it matters not by what process or
machinery the result is accomplished.  For aught that we now know,
some future inventor, in the onward march of science, may discover a
mode of writing or printing at a distance by means of the electric or
galvanic current, without using any part of the process or combination
set forth in the plaintiff's specification.  His invention may be less
complicated -- less liable to get out of order -- less expensive in
construction, and in its operation.  But yet, if it is covered by this
patent, the inventor could not use it, nor the public have the benefit of
it, without the permission of this patentee.'' <em>Id</em>., at 113.

<p>   In <em>The Telephone Cases</em>, 126 U.S. 1, 534, the Court explained the
<em>Morse</em> case as follows: ``The effect of that decision was, therefore,
that the use of magnetism as a motive power, without regard to the
particular process with which it was connected in the patent, could
not be claimed, but that its use in that connection could.'' Bell's
invention was the use of electric current to transmit vocal or other
sounds.  The claim was not ``for the use of a current of electricity in
its natural state as it comes from the battery, but for putting a
continuous current in a closed circuit into a certain specified
condition suited to the transmission of vocal and other sounds, and
using it in that condition for that purpose.'' <em>Ibid</em>.  The claim, in
other words, was not ``one for the use of electricity distinct from the
particular process with which it is connected in his patent.'' <em>Id</em>., at
535.  The patent was for that use of electricity ``both for the magneto
and variable resistance <em>methods</em>.'' <em>Id</em>., at 538.  Bell's claim, in other
words, was not one for all telephonic use of electricity.

<p>   In <em>Corning</em> v. <em>Burden</em>, 15 How. 252, 267-268, the Court said, ``One may discover
a new and useful improvement in the process of tanning, dyeing, etc.,
irrespective of any particular form of machinery or mechanical device.'' The
examples given were the ``arts of tanning, dyeing, making waterproof cloth,
vulcanizing India rubber, smelting ores.'' <em>Id</em>., at 267. Those are instances,
however, where the use of chemical substances or physical acts, such as
temperature control, changes articles or materials.  The chemical process or the
physical acts which transform the raw material are, however, sufficiently
definite to confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds.

<p>   <em>Cochrane</em> v. <em>Deener</em>, 94 U.S. 780, involved a process for
manufacturing flour so as to improve its quality.  The process first
separated the superfine flour and then removed impurities from the
middlings by blasts of air, reground the middlings, and then combined
the product with the superfine.  <em>Id</em>., at 785. The claim was not
limited to any special arrangement of machinery. <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court
said,

<p><blockquote>
   ``That a process may be patentable, irrespective of the particular
form of the instrumentalities used, cannot be disputed.  If one of the
steps of a process be that a certain substance is to be reduced to a
powder, it may not be at all material what instrument or machinery is
used to effect that object, whether a hammer, a pestle and mortar, or
a mill.  Either may be pointed out; but if the patent is not confined
to that particular tool or machine, the use of the others would be an
infringement, the general process being the same.  A process is a mode
of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result.  It is an
act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be
transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.'' <em>Id</em>., at
787-788.
</blockquote>

<p>   Transformation and reduction of an article ``to a different state
or thing'' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that
does not include particular machines.  So it is that a patent in the
process of ``manufacturing fat acids and glycerine from fatty bodies
by the action of water at a high temperature and pressure'' was
sustained in <em>Tilghman</em> v. <em>Proctor</em>, 102 U.S. 707,
721. The Court said, ``The chemical principle or scientific fact upon
which it is founded is, that the elements of neutral fat require to be
severally united with an atomic equivalent of water in order to
separate from each other and become free.  This chemical fact was not
discovered by Tilghman.  He only claims to have invented a particular
mode of bringing about the desired chemical union between the fatty
elements and water.'' <em>Id</em>., at 729.

<p>   <em>Expanded Metal Co.</em> v. <em>Bradford</em>, 214 U.S. 366, sustained a patent on a
``process'' for expanding metal.  A process ``involving mechanical operations, and
producing a new and useful result,'' <em>id</em>., at 385-386, was held to be a patentable
process, process patents not being limited to chemical action.

<p>   <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Snow</em>, 294 U.S. 1, and <em>Waxham</em> v.
<em>Smith</em>, 294 U.S. 20, involved a process for setting eggs in
staged incubation and applying mechanically circulated currents of air
to the eggs.  The Court, in sustaining the function performed (the
hatching of eggs) and the means or process by which that is done,
said:
   
<blockquote>
   ``By the use of materials in a particular manner he secured the
performance of the function by a means which had never occurred in
nature, and had not been anticipated by the prior art; this is a
patentable method or process. . . .  A method, which may be patented
irrespective of the particular form of the mechanism which may be
availed of for carrying it into operation, is not to be rejected as
`functional,' merely because the specifications show a machine capable
of using it.'' 294 U.S., at 22.  </blockquote>

<p>   It is argued that a process patent must either be tied to a
particular machine or apparatus or must operate to change articles or
materials to a ``different state or thing.'' We do not hold that no
process patent could ever qualify if it did not meet the requirements
of our prior precedents.  It is said that the decision precludes a
patent for any program servicing a computer.  We do not so hold.  It
is said that we have before us a program for a digital computer but
extend our holding to programs for analog computers.  We have,
however, made clear from the start that we deal with a program only
for digital computers.  It is said we freeze process patents to old
technologies, leaving no room for the revelations of the new,
onrushing technology.  Such is not our purpose.  What we come down to
in a nutshell is the following.

<p>   It is conceded that one may not patent an idea.  But in practical effect that
would be the result if the formula for converting BCD numerals to pure binary
numerals were patented in this case.  The mathematical formula involved here has
no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital
computer, which means that if the judgment below is affirmed, the
patent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect
would be a patent on the algorithm itself.

<p>   It may be that the patent laws should be extended to cover these
programs, a policy matter to which we are not competent to speak.  The
President's Commission on the Patent System<a name="F4"><a href="#FN4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> rejected the proposal that these
programs be patentable:<a name="F5"><a href="#FN5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a>

<p><blockquote>
``Uncertainty now exists as to whether the statute permits a valid
patent to be granted on programs.  Direct attempts to patent programs
have been rejected on the ground of nonstatutory subject matter.
Indirect attempts to obtain patents and avoid the rejection, by
drafting claims as a process, or a machine or components thereof
programmed in a given manner, rather than as a program itself, have
confused the issue further and should not be permitted.

<p>   ``The Patent Office now cannot examine applications for programs because of a
lack of a classification technique and the requisite search files.  Even if
these were available, reliable searches would not be feasible or economic
because of the tremendous volume of prior art being generated.  Without this
search, the patenting of programs would be tantamount to mere registration and
the presumption of validity would be all but nonexistent.

<p>   ``It is noted that the creation of programs has undergone substantial and
satisfactory growth in the absence of patent protection and that copyright
protection for programs is presently available.''
</blockquote>
 
If these programs are to be patentable,<a name="F6"><a href="#FN6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a> considerable problems are raised which only committees of
Congress can manage, for broad powers of investigation are needed,
including hearings which canvass the wide variety of views which those
operating in this field entertain.  The technological problems
tendered in the many briefs before us<a name="F7"><a href="#FN7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a>
indicate to us that considered action by the Congress is needed.
