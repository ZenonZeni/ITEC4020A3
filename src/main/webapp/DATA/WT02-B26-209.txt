<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
More than 20 years ago, the Clean Air Act accelerated the development of pollution-control technologies for coal-combustion systems.  Attention was focused on the abatement of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate-matter emissions.  Subsequent concerns over the possible effects of acid rain served to strengthen that focus.  In 1990, Amendments to the Act addressed acid rain controls and reinforced restrictions on other air pollutants, such as ozone, which is influenced by NOx emissions.  An additional concern now receiving greater attention is the safe and economical disposal of large volumes of solid wastes from air-pollution control systems.  As new issues arise and emissions limits are gradually reduced, there are continuing needs for engineering improvements and research into new concepts that could lead to improved processes.  New or improved technologies for controlling emissions of NOx and SOx will enable U.S. industry to continue to compete in a cost-effective, environmentally sound manner.

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
In response to the directives of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, Argonne National Laboratory is developing new or improved pollution-control technologies for industries that burn fossil fuels.  This research continues Argonne's traditional support for the DOE's Flue Gas Cleanup Program.  Argonne's pollutant emissions research has ranged from experiments in the basic chemistry of pollution-control systems, through laboratory-scale process development and testing, to pilot-scale field tests of several technologies.  Whenever appropriate, the work has emphasized integrated or combined control systems as the best approach to technologies that would offer low cost and good operating characteristics.
<P>
Laboratory facilities are available to address a variety of flue-gas cleanup problems by using realistic flue-gas compositions, on-line multicomponent gas analysis, and computerized data logging.  Current experimental systems include a complete wet scrubber, a unique spray-dryer/fabric-filter combination, and a fixed-bed reactor designed for investigation of dry sorbents.  Additional laboratory facilities are available for supporting bench-scale research and waste characterization studies.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Development and patenting of a NOx/SO2 process concept based on the use of ferrous ethylenediaminetetra acetate [Fe(II)·EDTA] in a wet flue-gas-desulfurization (FGD) system. This concept was later tested at pilot-plant scale.  Recent work has identified electrochemical techniques that can extend the useful life of the Fe(II)·EDTA additive.</LI>
<LI>Performance characterization of the first commercial-scale spray-dryer FGD system 	operating on high-sulfur coal.  This work, done on-site at Argonne, was documented in a design and operation handbook.</LI>
<LI>Identification of chemical additives and process conditions that promote NOx capture in spray-dryer/fabric-filter FGD systems.  The techniques were successfully tested in two sets of field tests by using Argonne's 20-MW spray-dryer system.</LI>

<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Efforts continue to emphasize combined NOx/SO2 control.  Preventing or reversing the oxidation of ferrous ions in Fe(II)<B>·</B>EDTA is the primary focus of the wet scrubbing research. Work on the chemical kinetics of the process will continue to improve understanding of the underlying phenomena and to guide process development.  Tests of flue-gas cleanup wastes and waste-processing techniques will continue in parallel with the process development activities.
