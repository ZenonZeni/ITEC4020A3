<P>




	The idea of curing depression strikes many people as inconceivable. However, the cures we have witnessed on a reliable basis using a new form of biofeedback with light stimulation may alter that view. The positive results achieved include: the disappearance of the feeling of depression; increased energy during the day and improved sleeping at night; an ability to initiate and sustain activities; improved short-term memory and attention; and re-engagement with life—completion of tasks such as moving out of problematic relationships, leaving a job, finding another, buying a house, or taking on new challenges.<p>
	BIOFEEDBACK WITH LIGHT CAN CURE DEPRESSION. We call our experimental tool for treating depression Interactive Light Therapy, or ILT; the technical name is EEG-Driven Photic Stimulation (EDS). ILT is an advanced form of biofeedback that I invented in 1990. At this point in our research, we have worked with 84 depressed patients, all of whom have shown significant relief from the varying aspects of depression. ILT has reliably improved depression, manic-depression, lifelong serious depression, suicidal ideas, attention problems, daytime low energy, sleeping disorders, and learning difficulties. Most of the people seeking ILT treatment who were depressed have been cured relatively easily.<p>
	Their positive changes appear to last for years after treatment ends. Bear in mind, this treatment will not make long-used psychological defenses go away easily. People will often feel confused as old defenses crumble and before their brains are able to naturally formulate new and more flexible ways to be in the world.<p>
	YOUR BRAIN IS IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALING. ILT is a noninvasive, painless, and passive form of biofeedback. You sit comfortably in a chair wearing dark glasses that have a set of tiny lights mounted on the lenses. The system monitors and analyzes your brain waves and uses these ever-changing wave patterns to continuously make the flashing lights relevant to you. The name Interactive Light Therapy refers to the fact that it is your brain that controls the gently-twinkling, dim light that is fed back (hence, biofeedback) to you.<p>
	Unlike traditional biofeedback, where the patient must actively learn and discriminate between different conscious states, with ILT there is no conscious learning task or need for attention. The person does nothing in particular while the brain is being fed the biofeedback. <p>
	ILT works because central nervous system symptoms and very strong, low-frequency brain waves are related. When people are overly stressed, injured, or traumatized, their brain waves may get fixed or stuck in a pattern of predominantly very strong, low frequency activity. <p>
	This is called EEG-slowing, and is associated with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue, hyperactivity, distractibility, mood swings, confusion, disorganization, sleep disorders, concentration, reading comprehension, memory, and attention. The increase in low-frequency brain wave activity is a typical pattern we have observed in many chronic health problems. <p>
	We believe that EEG-slowing occurs when the integrating function of the brain’s cerebral cortex is blocked. All of the aspects of depression mentioned above are associated with slower brain waves, or what we call EEG-slowing.<p>
	FLEXING YOUR BRAIN. Somewhat akin to an orchestra conductor, ILT helps to restore the integrating function of the cortex and thereby directly affects, and often resolves, the symptoms. More specifically, the patient’s strongest brain wave controls the rate at which a set of tiny lights flash dimly before the eyes. <p>
	We record the person’s brain waves then use these same frequencies to control the speed of lights that flash in front of their eyes. Then we work on changing the rigid ways the patient’s brain wave frequencies respond by alternately speeding up and slowing down these waves. This creates a new flexibility in the brain.<p> 
	The brightness of the lights is carefully adjusted for comfort as the interaction of the lights and the patient’s brain gently reduces the size (amplitude) of the low-frequency brain waves. These changes are the equivalent of greater brain and behavioral flexibility. When the slow-wave activity is integrated as higher and more varying brain waves, the presenting symptoms start to decrease and even disappear. At the end of therapy, the brain adopts this new flexibility and, like a thermostat that has been reset, it no longer needs the help of  ILT. <p>
	It seems that the best results occur when you have a “critical mass” of treatments, relatively close together. This helps overcome the rigidity of the body and brain that are maintaining the symptoms. The major implication of this work is that both the physically and psychologically injured brain has a greater capacity for recovery than has previously been appreciated by medicine. <p>
	97% OF PATIENTS IMPROVED. Only those with EEG-slowing can benefit from ILT. However, you can have this condition as a result of head injury, extreme stress, emotional trauma, attention deficit disorder, chronic fatigue or chemical dependence.	ILT has been studied clinically since 1990 when I received a patent for the invention of linking brain EEGs with sound and light in a biofeedback format. According to data we have collected, of 500 people treated with ILT, <p>
	97% have experienced significant improvements in their central nervous system symptoms and the benefits gained seem only to sustain or increase unless new trauma occurs. <p>
	At this time, there are 10 practitioners around the country who are conducting clinical trials with ILT. The work reported here shows that people who may have given up hope of relief through traditional medicine may now have another chance at recovery.<p>
