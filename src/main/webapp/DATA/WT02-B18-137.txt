    <h1 align="center">The APWU Health Plan-- A Great Deal for
    Union Members </h1>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Members of the APWU get a great deal when they take
advantage of the APWU Health Plan's outstanding benefits and low
premiums. This Open Season, </strong><font color="#008000"><strong><blink>November
11-December 9</blink></strong></font><strong>, every union member
should take a look at the excellent health care value offered by
the APWU Health Plan. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Protection and Peace of Mind </strong></p>
<p>For 1997, active postal employees pay only $10.70 biweekly for
Self Only coverage, just <strong>$25.21</strong> biweekly for
Self and Family. These low premiums assure you of protection and
peace of mind for your health care needs--comprehensive benefits,
including many services covered at 100 percent, and convenient
flexibility. </p>
<p>Members save money by using the plan's Preferred Provider
Organization--including over 200,000 primary care physicians,
specialists, surgeons, outpatient medical facilities,
chiropractors, mental conditions specialists and laboratories;
and nearly 3,000 hospitals. Members are also covered when they
choose any hospital or health care provider they wish. </p>
<p>The plan offers comprehensive prescription drug coverage as
well, with a network of 53,000 pharmacies and a mail order
program that will save you money. </p>
<p>Members of the APWU Health Plan can also take advantage of the
very popular Nurse Advisory Line--a voluntary service that gives
you a medical practitioner as close as the telephone 24 hours a
day. </p>
<p>There is much, much more offered by the APWU Health Plan. Be
sure to check it out in detail in the October and November issues
of <em>The American Postal Worker</em> or the October 3 <em>News
Service</em> bulletin. Or call the plan's Open Season hotline at <strong>1-800-PIC-APWU
(742-2798)</strong>; TDD/deaf, <strong>1-800-622-2511</strong>.
You can visit the Health Plan's web site at <strong>http://www.apwuhp.com. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>How to Join the Health Plan </strong></p>
<p>To join the APWU Health Plan this Open Season, go to your
personnel office or postmaster and request a Health Benefits
Registration form (Standard Form 2809). On the form, indicate
Code 471 for Self Only coverage or Code 472 for Self and Family
enrollment. Return the form to your personnel office or
postmaster by December 9. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Another Reason to Join the APWU </strong></p>
<p>If you or your coworkers aren't yet APWU members, you couldn't
ask for a &quot;healthier&quot; reason to join now. Join the
union that protects your rights on the job and offers protection
and peace of mind for your health care needs. For information
about the &quot;Solidarity '96&quot; organizing campaign and how
to join or sign up your coworkers, visit your local union office
or call the APWU Organization Department at <strong>202-842-4227</strong>.
Ask for an Organizing Kit and about how to win cash and other
prizes for joining and for signing up APWU bargaining-unit
workers into the union. </p>
<p>You can also earn $25 for each coworker you enroll in the
Health Plan through the &quot;New Member Incentive Program.&quot;
For details, call the plan at <strong>1-800-222-APWU (2798). </strong></p>

<h1 align="center">$187.20 Banked Toward Next COLA </h1>
<p><strong>After the third month of the third cost-of-living
adjustment period under the 1994-1998 Collective Bargaining
Agreement, postal workers have accumulated a cost-of-living
adjustment of 9 cents per hour, $7.20 per pay period or $187.20
annually. This results from an increase in the CPI-W to 463.2 in
October. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>CSRS and FERS </strong></p>
<p>CSRS retiree COLA is based on the third quarter (July, August,
September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the 1995 third
quarter average. The 1997 CSRS cost-of-living adjustment will be
2.9 percent and will be reflected in January 1997 annuity checks. </p>
<p>The formula for FERS retirees is the same as for CSRS
retirees, except that if the CPI-W average increases 3 percent or
more, the adjustment will be the CPI-W increase minus 1 percent.
If the CPI-W average increases between 2 and 3 percent, then the
adjustment will be 2 percent. The 1997 FERS cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2 percent and will be reflected in January
1997 annuity checks. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FECA COLA </strong></p>
<p>COLA increases for FECA recipients are based on the percentage
increase in the December index from year to year. After the tenth
month of the 1996 adjustment period, the CPI-W has increased 3
percent over the December 1995 base index. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ot.jpg" align="bottom"
width="261" height="25"></p>
<h1 align="center">Penalty Overtime Exclusion Period</h1>
<p><strong>In accordance with provisions of the National
Agreement, penalty overtime rates are not paid during the month
of December. It has been the practice to designate four
consecutive work weeks (which might include some days in
November) as the December penalty overtime exclusion period. For
December 1996, the American Postal Workers Union and the US
Postal Service agreed that the exclusion begins November 30, 1996
(start of week two of pay period 25-96) and ends December 27,
1996 (end of week one of pay period 01-97). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The November 7, 1996 <em>Postal
Bulletin</em> reported the wrong dates. Management will make the
necessary correction. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/lumpsum.jpg" align="bottom"

<h1 align="center">$400 Lump Sum</h1>
<p><strong>APWU members are reminded that the $400 lump sum
payment due on December 13 will be included in regular pay checks
However, tax withholding will be calculated separately at the
average tax rate for each employee for 1996. For more
information, refer to the November 8 issue of the </strong><em><strong>News
Service</strong></em><strong> bulletin.</strong></p>

<h1 align="center">&#160;Annual Leave Carryover</h1>
<p><strong>January 3, 1997 marks the end of the leave year for
1996. The 1994-1998 contract allows workers to carry over up to
440 hours of accumulated annual leave into the next year. Note
that any annual leave exceeding the 440-hour limit must be used
by January 3, 1997.</strong></p>

<h1 align="center"><strong>Acclaimed Drama, '</strong><em><strong>The
Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>'</strong></h1>
<h1 align="center"><strong>Available on Video </strong></h1>
<p><strong>Videocassettes of the Sundance award-winning, widely
acclaimed labor film, </strong><em><strong>The Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>,
are now available directly from Made in USA Productions, the
non-profit company which produced the film. </strong></p>
<p>This compelling dramatic feature film (1985, 118 minutes,
color) tells the timeless, true story of the courageous drive to
build an interracial labor union in the Chicago Stockyards in the
face of the brutal efforts by management to divide the workforce
during the 1919 race riots. <em>The Killing Floor</em> is an Elsa
Rassbach Production directed, by Bill Duke, and stars Damien
Leake, Alfre Woodard, Clarence Felder, Dennis Farina and Moses
Gunn. The research effort was led by scholars David Brody and
William Tuttle. </p>
<p>Shown on PBS in the 1980s, this union-made production was
supported by more than 30 unions and the AFL-CIO, as well as
federal and foundation grants. Reviewers have often called <em>The
Killing Floor</em> &quot;brilliant.&quot; <em>The Village Voice</em>
wrote that it's the most &quot;clear-eyed account of union
organizing on film.&quot; </p>
<p>This classic film has long been unavailable but
life-of-cassette leases are now available to labor and community
groups at prices ranging from $89.95 for one cassette to $49.95
each for 100 or more cassettes, plus shipping and handling. 16mm
film rentals are also available. Made in USA Productions will use
all proceeds for new labor film projects. For information or to
order (video orders must be prepaid), contact: Made In USA
Productions, 220 East 23rd Street, Suite 707, New York, NY 10010;
