RETAIL DELIVERY WILL COST YOU IN 1996 

     Expect to experience growing pains this year as technology
platforms inside your bank change to facilitate offering new retail
delivery channels to your customers.  But don't expect these channels
to produce profits any time soon.
     Almost half of the largest U.S. banks and one-third of the
country's mid-size banks are operating electronic banking programs at
a loss.  The majority cannot determine profitability, the American
Bankers Association (ABA) said in its "1995 Retail Banking Survey
Report."
     The losses were attributed to up-front development costs, which
likely will continue throughout 1996 as new retail delivery channels
gain consumer acceptance, the report said.
     Also in 1996, consultants predict:

     *   continued slow adoption of client-server
        applications;
     *   the call center will become a focal
        point of the customer relationship and a
        major sales and marketing tool; and 
     *   continued merging in the bank and vendor markets.

Drawbacks of the RDS Boom

     Development costs likely will put banks in the red as they try to
offer alternative delivery channels to their customers, consultants
say.  Developing online banking and in-bank connection software is
expensive.  It can cost $300,000 just to get into the newest retail
delivery systems, such as personal computer (PC) home banking and
Internet transactions.
     In most cases, banks can use some of their existing hardware to
offer new retail delivery channels.  But most of the new applications
are client-server-based, and the legacy systems cannot provide access
to information in an interactive environment, said David Taylor,
executive vice president at the Bank Administration Institute (BAI) in
Chicago.
     These programs must interface with existing business systems,
mainframes and each other, said Bob Landry, technology analyst with
the Tower Group in Wellesley, Mass.
     Building these platforms so that they can talk to each other
might be expensive but this should be a priority so that banks can
move forward with seamless marketing and accounting efforts, Landry
said.

Security Issues

     You need to pay attention to three key security issues as your
bank implements new technology to compete in the retail delivery
systems market, says BAI's 1995 study:  "The Information Superhighway
and Retail Banking:"

    *   Authentication.  Can you identify the party requesting a
    transaction?
    *   Authorization.  If the party is identified, how will the size
    and nature of the requested transaction be approved?
    *   Security and encryption.  Can you prevent third parties from
    improperly accessing private transaction data, such as credit
    card numbers? 

The Client-Server Dilemma

    Unexpected implementation and activation problems with client-
server technology is adding development and networking problems,
analysts told BAN.  It was touted as the technology that could save
banks up to 15 percent in systems development and management costs. 
But implementation problems have delayed activation and created the
need for extra personnel.
    At many banks, expenses related to implementation issues ate up
anticipated savings quickly, said David Koto, principal with Brintech
in New Smyrna Beach, Fla.  "No savings have been realized yet," he
said.
    But vendors are plugging away with client-server introductions
(BAN, Oct. 18, p. 1).  Five companies showed new client-server-based
core accounting systems at the MicroBanker Expo last year.
    An informal BAN poll of about a dozen users and consultants at
the expo revealed that Eastpoint Technologies of Bedford, N.H., and
Perot Systems of Dallas are the companies to watch in 1996.
    Phoenix International of Maitland, Fla., also is considered one
of the most innovative client-server vendors (BAN, Aug. 9, p. 1), but
it has not sold its Retail Banking System outside of the circle of
institutions that initially invested in the company.

The Growing Importance of Call Centers

    Call centers are becoming critical to banks, financial
institutions and other service-oriented businesses as they work to
keep existing customers, expand their business and save money,
consultants said (BAN, Sept. 20, p. 4).  You would be well-advised to
upgrade your own call center this year to keep pace with your
competitors, consultants said.
    Banks selling mature products, such as credit card services, are
finding that keeping existing customers is as important as gaining new
ones and that having a sophisticated call center is one way of
ensuring this happens.  Plus, the call center provides an opportunity
to offer both customer service and telemarketing in one swoop.  Savvy
banks are using well-trained employees to turn customer service
requests into opportunities to sell additional products.  
    Consultants predict the telephone will emerge as a major selling
tool this year.  Merrill Lynch & Co. has 400 branches, $500 billion in
assets and a national telephone support system.  "There's a tremendous
focus on call centers" to reduce staff and create better selling
environments, Landry added.
    Additionally, telephones likely will emerge as the method for
account creation and verification, says Richard Crone, senior vice
president at the $50 billion-asset Home Savings of America of
Irwindale, Calif.  Customers may not be going into the branch as much
but they still need their questions answered.
     The emerging importance of having a well-rounded call center
spells growing opportunity for vendors.  For example, Customer Access
of Raleigh, N.C., claims it can manage a bank's call center at a
savings of about 20 percent.  The outsourcer was founded in July 1993
by four former Citibank managers.  It has two large bank customers in
North Carolina and plans to open additional offices in other areas of
the country this year (BAN, Oct. 4, p. 6).
    Outsourcing call center management will be attractive to smaller
banks.  But banks also run the risk of losing the bank's customer
service "personality," said Jeff DiFrancesco, with New York-based
Price Waterhouse.

Outsourcing Takes Off

    Expect outsourcing to continue its growth in popularity as banks
realize they can't absorb expenses associated with operating
processing centers or developing technology, consultants also tell BAN
(see related story, p. 4).  Some of the largest outsourcing contracts
were signed last year.  Chase Manhattan Bank signed Milwaukee-based
FIserv to a 12-year contract for check processing and check-imaging
worth $480 million.  That contract is guaranteed until 1997, but may
be in jeopardy as Chase merges with Chemical Bank, also of New York.
    Bank managers are beginning to trust outsourcing more as they
watch these large successful contracts fulfilled, said Arthur Gillis
of Computer Based Solutions in New Orleans.  Expect this trend to
continue in 1996, he said.
    It would be surprising if more outsourcing companies merge or go
out of business because the most profitable outsourcers are the
largest, Gillis said.
    Bank and vendor mergers also are expected to continue in 1996. 
Columbus, Ohio-based Checkfree, a check processor, already has started
off the year's mergers with its acquisition of software vendor
Servantis of Norcross, Ga., to improve its retail delivery service.

TIPS FOR CONTRACTING TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE

    Many banks are hiring vendors to develop bank-branded software
because developing in-house is expensive.
    Bank-branded software differentiates products from your
competitors' but developing software in conjunction with a vendor has
several hidden problems that seem to originate before actual source
code-writing even begins.  One- quarter of all major software projects
are terminated before completion, experts estimate.  Studies indicate
that 75 percent of completed software projects are "operating
failures" and a disappointment to users.
    The type of contract you want is the first thing to consider when
outsourcing software development, said Joseph Auer, president of
International Computer Negotiations Inc. (ICN) in Winter Park, Fla. 
Banks basically have two choices -- resources- or results-oriented
contracts.  The key difference between contracting methods lies in who
assumes responsibility for meeting business objectives, he said.
    A resources contract entails hiring staff to work inside the bank
to develop the software.  In this scenario, the development is managed
entirely by the bank and the bank is responsible if the project fails,
Auer said.
    The software is developed off-site in a results-oriented
contract.  This type of project is managed by the vendor with the bank
contributing a small amount of resources, such as machine time, data,
floor space and access to management.  The vendor retains
responsibility for the end-product, Auer said.
    Savvy vendors create results and resources contracts that
stipulate joint responsibility and accountability, which may sound
good to bank managers who are unable to give up control or who think
it is a cop-out to outsource development.  But demanding control in a
development relationship is asking for trouble because vendors are
more than willing to take the bank's money and give it all the
responsibility for failed programs and bugs, Auer said.  "[Banks] are
saying `please can we be a big target.'"
    Negotiate provisions that make the vendor responsible for bugs
and performance failure.  This likely will produce a need for a
results-oriented contract, which places the project in the vendor's
court, he said.

Drafting the Right Agreement

    "A well-constructed contract should give the system buyer some
assurance that desired business results will be achieved within a
reasonable time frame," Auer said.  "One of the most effective
techniques for providing this type of assurance is to develop a
detailed project timetable based on identified tasks, task
interdependencies and deliverables to be included in the contract."
    A carefully drafted software development agreement will prompt
the vendor and the bank to consider issues upfront and prevent
disaster later.  This type of agreement also will give the bank legal
recourse against the vendor if something goes awry, says technology
legal expert Dan C. Aardal, partner at Brown Raymans & Millstein in
Los Angeles.
    Success seems to hinge on thoroughly evaluating bank needs prior
to jumping into the development phase.  Include user, performance and
maintenance requirements emanating from this evaluation in attachments
to the development contract, he said.
    Aardal's checklist for development agreements includes:

    *  user involvement;
    *  bimonthly progress reports; 
    *  request for proposals guidelines; 
    *  acceptance testing criteria; and more.

    Almost any of these elements can be critical, but several
commonly neglected provisions are often pitfalls for the bank, Aardal
said.  For example, ownership of the software should be stipulated in
the agreement so that no dispute arises after the fact, Aardal said.
    Make sure your bank owns the source code and has licensing rights
to the software in return for the high price you pay to develop it, he
said.  These terms should be negotiated into the contract because you
won't own the software automatically just because you paid to have it
developed.
    The developer may charge a higher price for ownership rights than
for licensing because it will be the developer's only opportunity to
make money on the software, he added.
    Pay the higher price: it will give you peace of mind.  No other
bank will be using the same program or, in the case of home banking
software, offering it to customers in competition with the bank that
paid for its development, Aardal explained.
    One of the most useful provisions you can negotiate is a most-
favored customer clause.  Such a bank customer is guaranteed to
receive prices and services that are better or equivalent to those
being offered to the vendor's other customers.  Additionally, it
guarantees that the most-favored bank's contract will be amended to
include the same services, refunds or credits granted to new customers
that were given a better deal, Aardal said. 

Bargain for Warranties

    Banks can bargain for a multitude of warranties, too, in these
contracts.  Standard warranties, protecting the bank against copyright
infringement and defects in the material and workmanship, should not
be controversial during negotiations, Aardal said.  But other types of
warranties seem more burdensome to the vendor, although they can
protect your bank better.
    One such warranty would guarantee that the licensor is aware of
the user's business requirements and the intended uses for the
software, and that the software will satisfy such requirements and is
fit for the intended uses.
    This warranty works best if the user has made the initial
investment of time and effort to describe its business requirements
and intended uses in the contract.  Attach that description as a
schedule or exhibit to the software license agreement, Aardal said.
    Additionally, a bank with the resources will have prepared a
request for proposals describing those requirements and that the user
can give to competing vendors, he said.
    Aardal advises bargaining for these additional warranties:

*   Acceptance testing.  Ensure that your bank has the right to
thoroughly test the software in-house before making final payment on
its development. Include testing procedures in the initial development
agreement. Tests should include a request that the software system run
successfully for about 30 days in a live operating environment.
*   Performance.  Specify transaction response time, transaction
capacity, and reliability requirements.  Software should perform in
accordance with description, specifications and documentation of the
software set forth in exhibits and schedules in the license agreement. 
It will be difficult to contend later that the software did not
perform a particular function unless the license and related
specifications indicated the software was supposed to perform that
function.
*   Maintenance.  Negotiate maintenance provisions at the same time as
the development agreement.  If you wait until after a development and
licensing agreement is signed, your bank will have little leverage. 
State in the agreement that the vendor must respond immediately to
service calls or you will be entitled to a free one-month extension of
the warranty period, or credit against future maintenance costs.  (Dan
Aardal, Brown Raymans & Millstein, 310/789-2100; Joseph Auer, ICN,
407/740-0700.)

SYNC LINKING LEGACY NETWORKS TO CLIENT-SERVER

     Sync Research Inc. wants to capitalize on the financial-
institution migration from IBM legacy systems to faster client-server
networks. (see related story, p. 1).  
     The Irvine, Calif.-based company believes it can profit from
these conversions.  Although Sync is not directly targeting banks,
company officials said it is aiming to "focus on the IBM-centric
customer that is looking to migrate to client-server."
     Historically, financial institutions have built large IBM
networks to support their branches.  These networks communicated
through numerous leased lines, which are both expensive and limited. 
With client-server and wide-area-network (WAN) enhancement, such as
frame relay; banks can send data at higher speeds.  Data transfer
between legacy systems and client-server networks now can be supported
on one line.
    Sync's FrameNode product line is the "translator" that makes
various communications protocols compatible, including asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) and ISDN technology.  Depending on the services
needed, Sync's FrameNode units can cost from $995 to $5,200 apiece.
    FrameNode manages the data that transfers between the old branch
terminal equipment and the newer personal computers.
    "We provide the glue, so to speak, between the legacy application
device -- the [IBM] 4700 controller or the [automated teller
machine] -- and this new WAN service," said Todd Krautkremer, a vice-
president at Sync.  "We connect the old device at the old speed and
the new devices as fast as you want."
    Sync, which began as a consulting firm in 1981 and started to
build products in 1986, began trading on the NASDAQ last fall.  It
will be releasing its fourth quarter earnings for the first time at
the end of January.
    The company's customers include New-York based Chemical Bank and
Citicorp., Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank and San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo Bank.  However, Krautkremer admits "the smaller banks can
benefit more greatly."  One of Sync's newest customers has only 50
branches.

Market Strategy

    Sync is positioning itself to be profitable even when the legacy
systems are dead -- although for many smaller institutions that may
take a very long time, according to industry analysts.
    Krautkremer said ATM, frame-relay and ISDN essentially run at the
same speed and the only thing that separates the three services are
prices, which depend upon the rates charged by the local telephone
companies.
    For example, frame relay may be more expensive than ISDN in
California but ISDN is more expensive than frame-relay in New York. 
So, as interstate banking takes effect, branches of a national bank in
California may be using different protocols than branches of the same
bank in New York.
    "[Telecommunications] carriers are stepping up with intelligent
networks and providing numerous migration paths," said Krautkremer. 
"We will be developing technologies that will allow frame relay to be
translated to ATM ... The device on the edge of the network needs to
be able to deal with multiple types of services."

HUMAN RESOURCES SOFTWARE AIMS TO CUT EMPLOYEE COSTS

     Human resources (HR) management costs can be held in-check with
new software from Englewood, Colo.-based Jam.LOGIC Designs.
     The start-up software company recently released a product to help
large banks manage their human resources tasks and small banks to
create a human resources department.
     The Windows-based HR Task Counselor is designed specifically for
banks, with features including 107 financial job descriptions, release
agreements, on-line databases and on-line regulatory assistance.
     Since its release in November, at least five institutions,
ranging in size from 30 employees to 150 employees, have purchased the
software.
     BAN has learned one large banking organization will consider
endorsing and distributing the product at its next meeting within the
next two months.

Pricing

     "For small organizations, [HR Task Counselor] is an affordable
alternative to hiring an HR manager.  They can't afford to pay $40,000
to $50,000 for someone to manage 50 employees," said Jeff Schmitz
president of Jam.LOGIC.  "For larger organizations, it is an
alternative to hiring an HR assistant."
     One software license for a bank with less than 50 employees will
cost $600 to cover first-year maintenance and regulatory updates.  The
average sale in the banking arena has been $3,000, according to
Schmitz.
     Large organizations will input job descriptions and place them on
the network so the entire institution has one set standard.  
     In addition, each module is user-defined with passwords.  For
example, marketing managers only can look at the performance reviews
of their employees, not of the entire company.  (Jeff Schmitz,
Jam.LOGIC Designs, 800/750-8113.)
