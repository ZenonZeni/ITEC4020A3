It's a good thing the day is short on miles, for it's guaranteed to be long on fun. First, after two short-but-sweet climbs over Dixie and Tipton mountains, we will be greeted by some foot-stomping, hand-clapping, fiddlin' music. It comes to us courtesy of the good folk of Unity, our lunch hosts, who have traveled several miles to meet us with a good meal and a warm welcome. Unity, located in Oregon's Burnt River Valley, is one of four ranching communities in the area.
<P>
Descending into Prairie City, we are greeted by another dramatic backdrop, this time from the Strawberry Mountains and the vast wilderness area they encompass. It's a beautiful setting for the evening activities which include everything from a natural history slide show, gold panning exhibition and cowboy poetry. Prairie City was once the western terminus of the Sumpter Valley Railroad. Check out the depot museum, open for your enjoyment.
