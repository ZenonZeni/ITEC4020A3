East Gippsland markets itself as the Victorian Riviera with
good reason. lt attracts nearly 650,000 tourists annually.  But
it is successful for other reasons as well.
</FONT>
<H2>All-year-round leisure activities</H2>
<P>
East Gippsland provides lifestyle opportunities for all age
groups, and this has in part contributed to the population
growth.  The region's temperate climate allows visitors and residents
to enjoy a great variety of activities all year round.
<P>
Regional population growth is concentrated around the Gippsland
Lakes area and in residential towns close to the major centres
including Bairnsdale and Maffra.
<P>
The region's population growth rate has created major
demands for secondary industries, particularly in construction,
which has also been stimulated by the growth in tourism and retirement
accommodation in the area.

<H2>East Gippsland is resource rich</H2>
<P>
East Gippsland is rich in timber,
agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, minerals and natural attractions.
It has a well developed infrastructure that meets the needs of
industry.
<P>
The region, and particularly the major centres of Bairnsdale,
Maffra, Lakes Entrance and Orbost, has water supplies of high
quality and of sufficient capacity to accommodate most needs.
<P>
The road system caters for nearly 90 per cent of freight and passengers,
and industries in the region use heavy road transport extensively.
Improved road access to Melbourne has enhanced the region's attractiveness
to industry.  The Princes Highway, National Route 1, passes through
the region and links it with Melbourne and Sydney.  Freight and
passenger road/rail links from Bairnsdale to Melbourne are fast
and frequent.
<P>
The region holds many opportunities for manufacturing
businesses.  This is particularly true for firms producing small,
light, high value-added products.
<P>
<H2>Primary industries</H2>
 <P>
East Gippsland has a well established infrastructure for the
timber and forest products industry.  The forests of East Gippsland
contain a wide variety of timber species, and legislation now
allows for integrated harvesting throughout the region.
<P>
This will result in all harvested timber being directed to
the best end use by allocating logs to the most suitable value-adding
operators.  This applies to specialty timbers, high quality saw
logs, low grade saw logs and residual roundwood.  The potential
uses of residual roundwood include sawn and treated timber products,
chips and pulp.
<P>
Agriculture is the region's largest employer, with 15% of
the workforce, and through both the direct earnings and flow-on
effects in service sectors, it is one of the major contributors
to the region's economy.
<P>
Beef cattle, sheep, both for wool and meat, and dairying have
been the traditional agricultural mainstays.  Vegetable production
is a growing industry, and it has been estimated that only 50
per cent of the available quality land for vegetable production
is currently being used.
<P>
The area has the potential to generate much greater volumes
of produce for fresh and processed markets for both domestic and
export consumption.
<P>
A variety of soils and climates suitable for many agricultural
activities exists in the region.  The most versatile areas are
the coastal river flats and flood plains that have good access
to irrigation, a mild winter climate, and can be used for intensive
production.
<P>
<H2>Commercial fishing centre</H2>
<P>
Lakes Entrance is the largest fishing
port in Victoria, supporting up to 180 fishing vessels.  It is
also home to a number of vessels servicing the industry, as well
as those servicing the Bass Strait oil rigs.
<P>
<img src="gifs2/egship.gif" align=right>
The region's extensive
coastline provides a diverse habitat for a variety of commercial
fish species and supports many fisheries, including inlet, estuarine,
abalone, scallop and in-shore and off-shore trawling.<P>Lakes Entrance's
well established port facilities, including shipyards and the
cooperative processing plant, as well as the skilled workforce,
could see the region's fishing industry expand and adapt to meet
new market demands.  Mallacoota is already the base for the export-oriented
abalone industry.
<P>
<H2>Enormous tourist potential</H2><P>The region's tourist potential is
enormous.  The Gippsland Lakes, 400 square kilometres of sheltered
inland waterways, are one of Victoria's premier tourist destinations
for boating, fishing and waterside activities.<P>East Gippsland's
National Parks, (Croajingalong, Errinundra and Snowy River) provide
coastal, rainforest and alpine reserves.  The Buchan Caves system
is a favourite destination attracting up to 200,000 visitors annually,
while the 90 Mile Beach offers visitors uninterrupted vistas and
beautiful stretches of beach.<P>The region's climate guarantees year-round
activities.  The coastal and lakes areas have mild, still winters,
often with the warmest temperatures in the state, and the mountains
are renowned for their reliable snow season.<P>Bullock Island near
Lakes Entrance offers a unique tourist development opportunity.
 The island is located at the western end of Lakes Entrance, and
is connected to the adjacent highway by a bridge.  It could incorporate
resort accommodation, restaurants, cafes and sports and recreation
facilities.<P>Because of the huge numbers of tourists attracted to
the region, opportunities exist for service-oriented businesses
to provide accommodation, restaurants and other attractions.</H2>
