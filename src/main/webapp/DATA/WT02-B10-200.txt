<p><b>What are the Diagnostic Criteria for Bulimia Nervosa?</b> </p>
<p>The following are required for the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa: </p>
<ul>
<li>regular (at least twice a week) episodes of binge-eating characterized by both: </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1) eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely 
larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time under similar circumstances </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2) a sense of loss of control over eating during these episodes (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or 
control what or how much one is eating) </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>regular (at least twice a week) inappropriate compensatory behavior, such as self-induced vomiting; abusing 
laxatives, diuretics or enemas; fasting; or excessive exercise. </li>
<li>undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation </li>
<li>anorexia nervosa is not present (i.e., weight is greater than 85% of expected body weight) </li>
</ul>
<p>These criteria are established by the American Psychiatric Association and published in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>. </p>
<p>You may refer to the following cases for additional information on bulimia. They are based on two different patient's 
medical histories. The stories have been altered so as to protect the identity of the patient.</p>
