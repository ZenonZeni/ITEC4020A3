<p>A mathematician, an accountant and an economist apply for the
same job. The interviewer calls in the mathematician and asks
&quot;What does two plus two equal?&quot; The mathematician
replies &quot;Four.&quot; The interviewer asks &quot;Four,
exactly?&quot; The mathematician looks at the interviewer
incredulously and says &quot;Yes, four, exactly. &quot;Then the
interviewer calls in the accountant and asks the same question
&quot;What does two plus two equal?&quot; The accountant says
&quot;On average, four - give or take ten percent, but on
average, four. &quot;Then the interviewer calls in the economist
and poses the same question &quot;What does two plus two
equal?&quot; The economist gets up, locks the door, closes the
shade, sits down next to the interviewer and says &quot;What do
you want it to equal?&quot; </p>

<p>One of the basic tenets of economics is the theory that the
supply of money spreads over the entire supply of goods. In other
words, if the system you are examining has 100 equally valued
items for sale and there is 100 dollars in the system to buy
them, then each item will be valued at one dollar. If the system
is infused with 100 more dollars, no one is any richer since both
demand and supply has remained the same, only the numbers have
changed. All that happens is the price of each item doubles. </p>

<p>You would think that if the result were a &#147;wash&#148; the
government wouldn't inflate the currency because it would have
nothing to gain, but what really happens is that the government
spends the money before the economy realizes that it is only
worth half as much. This resembles the children's game of
&#147;Old Maid&#148; In this version everyone tries to spend the
money before everyone else catches on. </p>

<p>The attached chart was brought to my attention by one of our
subscribers. It presents an interesting picture and I appreciate
you bringing it to my attention. </p>

<p>The article concluded from the data that we should be entering
a period of inflation because the chart is turning up. This
appears reasonable at first look. </p>

<p><img src="../images/Nov_952.gif" align="bottom" width="574"
height="442"> </p>

<p>The chart on the previous page was developed by dividing M3
(the broadest definition of money supply) by the annual change in
GDP <i>i.e.</i> the increase (or decrease) in the quantity of
goods produced vs. those produced the previous year. The result
is sort of &#147;the amount of money available to spend on new
goods produced.&#148; </p>

<p>This appeared interesting so I studied the actual data. I
found that this chart looks almost identical to M3 alone, so the
change in GNP had very little effect. So what you are actually
looking at is a chart of M3 which ought to be an indicator of
inflation. However, M3 plotted against total GNP (not shown)
appears quite different but shows the recent downtrend but not
much else of interest. </p>

<p>Since the economy is so large I thought perhaps a 4 year
moving average would show us the actual trend that the economy
would see. As we would expect the early seventies showed a large
increase which would result in inflation but unexpectedly the 4
year average peaks in 1975 not in 1980. Not until we extend the
time frame out to 8-10 years do we peak in 1980 where gold
actually peaked (see the dotted 8 year average line). This would
lead me to conclude that if M3 has any effect at all it takes a
very long time. </p>

<p>The MIP is in a downtrend for the first half of next year, so
we know the uptick will not occur before then. </p>

<p>By observing the trend of the 8 year moving average line we
see that the seventies were a time of inflation, the early
eighties were relatively flat, and the past 10 years were in a
downtrend with a final bottom actually registering in the
negative range in 1993. </p>

<p>If the peak in M3/GDP in 72-74 corresponds to the gold peak in
1980 we should expect a 6-8 year lag from the bottom of the most
recent decline. This would mean low interest rates and increasing
bond prices through this century! A 6 year lag would put the
bottom in 1999. The only indicator that might lead us to conclude
that an upturn is eminent is that M3/GDP has crossed up through
the 8 year average line. </p>

<p>If 1999 turns out to be the bottom we may see true deflation
not just disinflation and maybe even negative interest rates like
in Switzerland in the 70's. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the smaller peaks and valleys should provide us
with plenty of trading opportunities. But if the overall trend is
down we would expect greater profitability on the Bond side of
each trade since Gold would only be a counter trend blip. </p>

<p>Regardless of when the up surge occurs next year or in 1999,
the MIP should keep us on the right side of the market and give
us plenty of warning as to the exact timing of the up turn. </p>

<p>This is a perfect illustration of how two people can look at
the same data and come to two different conclusions. Thus the
advent of the stock market and economist jokes. </p>

<h2><a href="Nov_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Relative Strength Index">Relative Strength Index</a></h2>

<p>Several subscribers showed interest in the relative strength
index presented last month (since it is such a highly useful
tool) so I am including the formula for calculating the RSI and
will try to include a chart of both a gold mutual fund and a bond
mutual fund each month. I wish I could include all the gold funds
I follow to show you the comparison but of course space would not
allow that. Suffice it to say they are surprisingly similar with
one occasionally demonstrating a specific characteristic better
than the others. </p>

<p><img src="../images/Nov_953.gif" align="bottom" width="568"
height="440"></p>

<p>One key indicator for Relative Strength is called
&#147;Negative Divergence&#148; this is illustrated in the Benham
Gold chart on this page by the trend lines. This is generally a
very good indicator that a turn is eminent. Circle &#147;A&#148;
resembles the current situation so hopefully we will see a
similar run-up. </p>

<p>Benham 2020 is showing signs of negative divergence now. (see
previous page). </p>

<p>The formula for calculating the Welles Wilder RSI is: </p>

<p><img src="../images/MS_RSI.gif" align="bottom" width="192"
height="45"> First you calculate the change which is simply =
Today's close - Yesterday's close. If positive it equals +1, if
negative it equals -1. If no change it equals zero. </p>

<p>UpAve is calculated by adding all the +1's over the period
(usually 14 trading days) </p>

<p>DnAve is calculated by adding all the -1's (zero's are
ignored). The final step is to plot the current point on a chart
with horizontal lines at the 30%, 50% &amp; 70% points. </p>

<p>The long trend up represented by line &#147;A&#148; is quite a
ways below our current position allowing for a major decline from
here without disrupting the long term trend. Line &#147;B&#148;
is also providing support at our current position as is downtrend
line &#147;C&#148;. If Microsoft remains above it's recent low of
83 1/8 we will have a higher low and a positive signal. The next
thing to look for would be a close above line &#147;D&#148; and
preferably above point &#147;2&#148; leaving only point
&#147;1&#148; to conquer. Breaking through &#147;D&#148; &amp;
&#147;2&#148; will almost guarantee a close above
&#147;1&#148;.This being the fourth upward thrust after
&#147;1&#148; it is very critical. If we do not see a close above
point &#147;1&#148; on this thrust we will close our Microsoft
positions and you could consider a short position. But at this
point MSFT's RSI is extremely oversold and could be developing
the momentum necessary to break above trendline &#147;D&#148;.
once again this is the final thrust. If it doesn't make it
&#147;goodbye Microsoft&#148;. </p>

<p><img src="../images/Nov_957.gif" align="bottom" width="910"
height="622"> The dollar has declined a bit in the last month but
is making a positive formation. Trend line &#147;A&#148; shows
higher lows and provides good support even though trendline
&#147;B&#148; is down. This is forcing a confrontation which will
probably result in a breach of line &#147;B&#148;. This would
leave us with a rise with resistance at every dotted line. With
lines &#147;D&#148; and &#147;G&#148; being the strongest.
Chances are slim that it will break through &#147;G&#148; but I
wouldn't be surprised to see it rise to test it again. </p>

name="The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP)">The Moore Inflation
Predictor (MIP)</a></h2>

<p>The October Consumer Price Index came in significantly higher
than September, as we have been predicting for six months!
Considering the fact that we have been in a steady downtrend
during that entire period, I think we can be proud of our
accuracy in calling this turning point. </p>

<p>If this month's inflation rate continues for 11 more months,
next year we would be looking at almost 4% inflation, a
staggering increase from last month's 2.5% rate. Fortunately, for
our wallets at the checkout stand, our numbers predict only a
couple of month's increase before a return to the downtrend. This
downtrend, of course, is not a decrease in prices (deflation)
simply a lower rate of increase (disinflation). </p>

<p><img src="../images/Nov_958.gif" align="bottom" width="910"
height="622"> </p>

<p>We are still looking to profit from our gold positions. Gold
is up 5% from it's recent low and by combining relative strength
indicators with the Moore Inflation Predictor, we will be able to
more closely identify the exact turning point as January
approaches. We continue to expect a sell-off in Bonds, and
Utilities through the January turning point. This is confirmed by
the relative strength indicators which are in extremely
overbought condition. Gold should continue to do well. </p>

<p>Best Wishes. I hope you caught the bottom in gold and are
enjoying the ride. </p>

<h2><a href="Nov_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="How To Read The MIP Chart">How To Read The MIP Chart</a></h2>

<p>The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is primarily a
predictor of the inflation rate for the coming 12 months. It is
extremely accurate over a six month time frame and accurately
forecasts turning points out to the 1 year mark. </p>

<p>The vertical axis is the inflation rate in percentage terms
while the horizontal axis is the date. The left side of the chart
is the actual historical Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). While the
right side is the predicted CPI-U. </p>

<p>The right side consists of several diverging lines starting at
a &#147;You are here&#148; arrow. The median line is the most
likely prediction for the future CPI-U with likely highs and lows
diverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. </p>

<p>By focusing on the median line you can easily see future
turning points in the CPI-U index. An increase in this index
usually translates to an increase in the price of gold, gold
stocks and other precious metals and commodities. A decrease in
the CPI-U index usually indicates a decrease in the above and an
increase in Bonds, Utilities and other interest sensitive
instruments. </p>

<p><b>CPI Data-</b> By annualizing the CPI-U Data over various
time spans we can get an idea of the likely range over the next
year's time frame. Keep in mind that 1 and 2 month rates have
very little long-term significance. </p>

<p><b>The Basic Portfolio-</b> For the simplest portfolio stay
with the Benham Family. We have chosen Benham for two reasons. 1)
It has a good Gold Fund. 2) It has a long term Bond Fund that is
usually the most volatile (i.e. provides the greatest upside
potential during up moves) 3) It has several alternatives for
parking funds during periods of uncertainty. </p>

<p>Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham Gold
Equity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. </p>

<p><b>New Money-</b> Any funds recently freed up can be invested
in Gold funds, Money Market funds or Cash (Interest Bearing). </p>

name="Making Your Money Work for You">Making Your Money Work for
You </a></h1>

<p><b>BY LISA MCMAHON</b> </p>

<p>Did you know that you will earn a fortune in your lifetime!
Let's say that you earn an average of $30,000 a year. Over a 40
year period that amounts to $1.2 million. You can do simple
arithmetic. Figure it out yourself. How much will you have earned
over your lifetime? </p>

<p>Let's look at some facts of life. Americans save less than
anyone else in the world. We save 5.2% of our disposable income
compared to 14% by the Germans, 15% by the British, and 20%by the
Japanese (source: Bureau of Economic analysis, Department of
Commerce). Here's another disturbing fact: Most Americans retire
in poverty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 87% of Americans
65 and older retire on incomes of $10,000 or less a year and 67%
of those retire on incomes of less than $5,000. </p>

<p>Inflation is destroying purchasing power. The combined rate of
inflation from 1990 to 1995 was about 20%. </p>

<p>Taxes are another problem for every wage-earner in America.
The average worker in America works 2 hours, 40 minutes each day
just to pay taxes. </p>

<p>There are three keys in making your money work for you. They
are: (1) Good Saving Habits; (2) Compound Interest; and (3) Money
Storage. </p>

<h2><a href="Nov_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Good Saving Habits">Good Saving Habits</a></h2>

<p>To help understand how money works, let us make a few
assumptions. Assume your goal is to accumulate a $100,000
retirement nest egg at age 65. If you could get a 12% return on
your money, how much would you have to save each month? If you
started at age 25 you would only have to save $10 a month to
reach your goal. If you started at age 35, you would need $30 a
month. If you waited until you were 45 you would have to save
$100 a month. If you were a real procrastinator and waited until
you were 55 you would need a whopping $435 a month to reach your
goal! </p>

<p>Let's say that you made a one time investment of $1000

<h3>Money Storage</h3>

<p>The average investor uses Banks, Saving &amp; Loans, Credit
Unions and Insurance companies for their investments. The
interest rate from these institutions varies from 2 - 6%. They
charge from 7-18% (or more) for loaning out that same money&#151;<b><i>your
money</i></b>! </p>

<h3>Start a Family Tradition</h3>

<p>How much will you need to save per year to reach your $100,000
goal at age 65? This chart shows how much you need to save per
year at different investment return rates and the number of years
you need to save. Obviously the sooner that you start saving and
the higher the return the less you have to save per year. </p>

<p>If your children can take the $100,000 that you have left them
and add another $100 a month at 10% for 40 years, it will add up
to (or should I say multiply to) $5,057,035! So start saving <b>now </b>and
I will see you next month. </p>

<p>*Income taxes may be due annually on the interest earned, even
though the money is invested and is not a part of your
&#147;disposable&#148; income unless you invest tax deferred such
as in an Annuity or IRA. </p>
