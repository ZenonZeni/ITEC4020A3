<H3>Those Who Suffer Blame Themselves</H3>
<DL>
<DD><P>Even among those suffering from Depressive Illness, most do 
not know they have a treatable illness. Most blame 
themselves and are blamed by others. This leads to the 
alienation of family and friends who, if they knew of the 
illness, would be likely to offer support and help find 
effective treatment. 
</DL>
<H3>There Are Several Causes of Depressive Illness</H3>
<OL>
<LI><P>There are probably several causes of Depressive Illness and 
several different types of depression. Recent research shows 
that depression runs in families. The most severe form, 
bipolar disorder, is most likely inherited.</P>
 
<LI><P>Certain environmental situations, such as stress or breakup 
of important attachments, may precipitate depression, 
especially in vulnerable persons.</P>
 
<LI><P>Research is underway to understand the interaction of genes 
and environment, and precisely what is inherited.</P>
