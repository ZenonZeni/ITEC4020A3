</CENTER>


<H4>Welcome to ARHC Infertility Chatroom</H4>
Thanks for visiting our chatroom. The java chat applet may take a few minutes to load on your computer. When the loading is completed, the gray square at the bottom of this page will contain the chat winndow. You may float the chat window and continue to browse on the web if you like. A second endometriosis chat room will be available soon.



<H4>Chat Room Technical Requirements</H4>



<b>Due to the volume of traffic on the chat server, you may experience a delay of up to two or three minutes for the chat program to initialize. Please be patient. (A little MD humor) The grey box will be replaced with a chat window when the java script has completely transferred. Unfortunately the chat server provider, Earthweb, chose today to switch to a new server. If you are unable to connect tonight, please send an email and let me know. SUBJECT: NOCHAT. </b><a href="emailto:support@chatplanet.com">EMAIL</a>



<p>The ARHC Chat Room is a java application that runs in your browser window.  You must have a java-capable browser such as <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/" TARGET="_top">Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0</A>, <a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/client_download.html" target="_top">Netscape Navigator 2.X + </a>, or <a href="http://www.sun.com" target="_top">Sun's HotJava</a> to participate in this forum.  This Chat Room is provided as a meeting place for you and your colleagues.  To arrange a meeting, share the URL for the ARHC Chatroom and arrange a suitable time for participating members.</p>







<h4>Weekly Chat Room Conference</h4>







<p>Effective Monday, January 6th, 1997, the ARHC Chat Room will be monitored from 9:00 - 10:00 P.M. EST every Monday night by Dr. Perloe. </p>
