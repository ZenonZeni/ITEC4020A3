Dr. Elmer Struening (Principal Investigator), Dr. Susan Barrow (Co-Principal Investigator), Pilar C&oacute;rdova, Sala Nolan, Gloria Thomas, and Seon Mee Hong completed the data collection phase of their evaluation of A Project to Link Up Services (A-PLUS), a psychiatric assessment and case management program for mentally ill women residing in New York City shelters. A sample of 294 women were interviewed at the time of referral to A-PLUS, with follow-up interviews conducted 12 and 24 months after baseline. Current data analyses focus on the relationship of A-PLUS services to housing stability, psychiatric status, and use of treatment services. Preliminary findings indicate that a third of the sample remained homeless after two years; 10% were in institutional settings (hospitals, jails); and the remaining 56% were housed-either independently (17%), with relatives (12%), or in supportive community settings (27%).

Dr. Struening (Principal Investigator), Dr. Barrow (Co-Principal Investigator) and Ms.  C&oacute;rdova extended the data collection phase for their Follow-up Study of Adult Shelter Residents, which has entailed tracing and reinterviewing a sample of over 1,000 men and women initially interviewed in a 1987 survey of municipal shelter residents. The primary locus of field activity has shifted from the shelter system to other institutional and community settings. Current analyses of preliminary data focus on residence history and baseline psychiatric/substance abuse status as predictors of subsequent patterns of homelessness and shelter use.

Dr. Barrow, as Principal Investigator, is beginning a study of low demand interim housing services provided by outreach and drop-in programs that serve homeless adults living on the streets and in other public places. The evaluation will examine the programs' effectiveness in transitioning clients to permanent housing and linking them to psychiatric treatment, substance abuse programs, and other support services.

Dr. Patricia Cohen was President of the Society for Multivariate Experimental Psychology during this year. Her presidential address, delivered at the annual meeting at Princeton University, was entitled Childhood Risks for Adult Personality Disorder: Method and Substance. It reviewed the impact of 36 risks measured during childhood on young adult personality disorder in the longitudinal cohort studied in the Children in the Community study on which she has been Principal Investigator over the past 12 years. A symposium on related issues was featured at the meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, where papers based on the same study were presented by Dr. Cohen on the continuity of disruptive disorders into adulthood, by Dr. Stephanie Kasen on the adult consequences of adolescent disorder, by Dr. Anne Provet on a comparison of environment, family, and child characteristics as childhood risks for adult psychopathology, by Dr. David Bernstein on continuity of personality disorder from adolescence to adulthood, by Dr. Jason Liu on neurasthenia in this cohort, and by Dr. Judith Brook on risks for and consequences of illicit drug use in adolescence. Dr. Cohen continued work on the two projects on this cohort and its offspring, on which she is Principal Investigator, and on two related projects on which she is Co-Principal Investigator. A Research Scientist Development Award was given to Dr. Cheryl Slomkowski, with Dr. Cohen and Dr. David Shaffer as mentors. She also continues as a member of the Services Review Group at the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH).

Dr. Mark Olfson helped to conduct a statewide study of the general hospital inpatients treatment of schizophrenia, developed a scale to measure the inpatient treatment of schizophrenia, examined national trends in utilization of mental health services and prescription of psychotropic medications, and assisted with the development of a novel system to facilitate the diagnosis of mental disorders in primary care.

Dr. Rodrick Wallace's work for the period again focused on understanding the processes of outward diffusion of social disintegration and its correlates of deterioration in public health and public order from collapsing inner city communities into larger metropolitan regions. This has resulted in a number of papers published and in press, including one which examines the diffusion of AIDS, TB, violent crime, and low birthweight in eight United States metropolitan areas containing over 54 million people. AIDS was found to be diffusing outward near size of the eight, TB near five, violent crime near two, and low birthweight near one. All four pathologies were found to be diffusing into the suburbs near New York City.

Dr. Daniel Herman received a five-year Scientist Development Award from NIMH which will permit him to obtain additional training in epidemiological and statistical methods at Columbia University's School of Public Health, and to conduct research under the mentorship of several senior researchers. His mentors include Drs. Struening, Link, and Cohen (of Epidemiology of Mental Disorders), as well as Drs. Christina Hoven, Ezra Susser, and Janet Williams. Dr. Herman's primary research focus continues to be on the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and adverse psychosocial outcomes during adulthood such as mental disorder, substance abuse, and homelessness. He published a paper in the American Journal of Public Health on the association between childhood foster care experience and depressive symptoms in adulthood, and is currently examining childhood risk factors for homelessness in data collected as part of Dr. Link's nationwide study of formerly homeless people.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Bruce Link conducted research as Principal Investigator on two projects-an NIMH-funded study of the experience of homelessness in a nationwide sample of formerly homeless people and an intervention study designed to help people with mental illness cope with stigma, which was funded by a NARSAD Senior Investigator Award. Dr. Link published a major paper in the American Journal of Public Health concerning the surprising number of people who have experienced homelessness in the United States. He is now analyzing data about the psychosocial and mental health risk factors for homelessness based on this nationwide data. With respect to his research interest in stigma, Dr. Link, Dr. Struening, and colleagues have developed an intervention and are testing it in a randomized trial in a clubhouse setting for people with severe mental illness.

Dr. Howard Andrews, together with Dr. Doris Goldberg of the New York City Department of Health and Dr. Virginia Rauh of the Columbia School of Public Health's Division of Population and Family Health, have been developing several projects based on the linkage of large data sets containing information on childhood risk and educational outcomes. One paper has been accepted for publication and two grant proposals have been submitted. The proposals involve use of the linked dataset to conduct comprehensive evaluations of the Head Start Program in New York City, using school outcomes data, including identification of children with emotional disorders in the school system.

John Pittman and Howard Andrews, co-directors of the department's Database Management and Statistical Analysis Unit (DBM/SAU), have developed five long-term contracts for data management and statistical analysis. Three full-time RFMH staff members are supported by these contracts. A grant proposal that would involve an additional contract has been submitted.

The impact of a relative with severe mental illness on the well being of a designated caregiver is a multi-site longitudinal study of hospitalized psychiatric patients. Drs. Elmer Struening (Principal Investigator), Phyllis Vine, Ann Stueve, Bruce Link, Dolores Kreisman, and Ms. Maureen Ellis and Margaret Newmark are assessing the impact of a relative with severe mental illness on a designated caretaker and other members of the household. Baseline interviews have been administered to 180 designated caretakers at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Westchester County. The follow-up protocol has been completed on 75% of the baseline sample. The liaison teams are comprised of Drs. Sig Ackerman, Marcia G. Torres, and Ms. Judith Greenwald, and Dr. Ken Terkelsen, Ms. Judith Guberman and Susan G. Salit, respectively. Baseline data are being analyzed for initial reports and papers. Studies of change in caregivers as a function of symptom remission and behavioral stabilization in their relatives are in progress.

The Biosocial Treatment Research Division finished collecting data for the Work in Family-Aided Assertive Community Treatment project (funded by a NIMH Community Support Project Grant), and was engaged in cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis. Preliminary analyses provided encouragement that our primary hypothesis for the study would be supported: that is, that FACT clients would be more likely to be employed than the conventional vocational rehabilitation (CVR) clients.
