for Earth Watchers <BR>

</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">CSIRO today released a CD-ROM,

designed to help teachers and students around the world to learn about remote

sensing of the Earth from space. The disk contains sample data from satellites

operated by members of CEOS, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites,

whose annual meeting concluded in Canberra today.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">The disk also includes lesson plans,

text books, case studies, glossaries and contact address information to

help inexperienced users of remote sensing discover how to find drinking

water in India; how to locate the source of the Amazon; to manage fish stocks

in Tanzania; and how grass and forest fires in China can be located and

controlled, through the help of images of the Earth obtained from satellites.

<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">The project was managed by the CSIRO

Office of Space Science &amp; Applications, building on work of the Science

and Technology Agency of Japan, the Indian Space Research Organisation,

and other international space agencies and research organisations, which

contributed data and information on the disk. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm

McIntosh, who launched the CD today in Canberra, said &quot;The CD contains

information previously too expensive, obscure or inaccessible to be readily

useable in educational circles or in remote areas&quot;. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">&quot;The case studies contained

on the disk show practical benefits from space technology, advancing quality

of life and supporting sustainable development. The new Australian space

program, centred on the FEDSAT project to build small but useful satellites,

will follow the a similar approach&quot;, said Dr McIntosh.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Dr Brian Embleton, Head of the CSIRO

Office of Space Science and Applications, said &quot;This CD is likely to

benefit developing countries, where the price of remotely sensed data precludes

it from being used as much as it should be. Similarly, schools throughout

the world will be able to use these teaching materials to study advanced

space technologies and their practical applications.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Copies of the CD are available,

at $20 each including postage, from The Information Officer, CSIRO Office

of Space Science and Applications</FONT> <BR>
