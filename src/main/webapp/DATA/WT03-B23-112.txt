<P>
On the 15th December,1995, Mr. Chris Sidoti, The Human Rights
Commissioner released the &quot;Report of the Reconvened Inquiry
into Human Rights of People with Mental Illness&quot;. This reconvened
inquiry was conducted by the former Human Rights Commissioner,
Mr. Brian Burdekin in response to a large number of requests for
his inquiry to reconvene. Some of the grounds for reconvening
in Victoria were that many care- givers within the mental health
system felt &quot;intimidated&quot;, were &quot;frightened to
complain&quot; or &quot;might lose funding&quot; and so had felt
unable to comment at the earlier inquiry about the problems inherent
in the rapid rate of reform in the Victorian Department of Psychiatric
Services.<BR>

<P>
In April 1994, the Victorian Government launched &quot; Victoria's
Mental Health Service: The Framework for Service Delivery&quot;
this contained a five year plan to redevelop and redistribute
mental health services in Victoria. The Human Rights Commissioner's
Report is critical of the approach of government whereby it is
implementing changes at such a rapid rate that the needs of mental
health consumers cannot be met. The Report highlights a number
of concerns which can be summarized as follows:
<P>
1. Clinical labels are attached to mental health consumers to
the exclusion of environmental factors.
<P>
2. The gaps caused by the rapid reforms are left unplugged causing
great pressures for those with the mental illness, their carers
and their families.
<P>
3. Resources are inadequate and carers are overworked.
<P>
4. Inadequacy of services for especially vulnerable or disadvantaged
groups including the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities.
<P>
5. There is a lack of co-ordination between different services
and different departments.
<P>
6. There is a lack of consultation between the government departments
and non government agencies, consumers and carers.
<P>
7. Unqualified people are administering medication in non-specialist
residential facilities.
<P>
8. There is a climate of &quot;intimidation&quot; within the Psychiatric
Services field.
<P>
These are but some of the observations made in the report. <BR>

<P>
Deinstitutionalisation is an International trend and fits in with
a civil libertarian view that human beings have a right to freedom
and liberty. The United Nation's &quot;Principles for The Protection
of Persons with Mental Illness&quot; are based on the principles
of the least restrictive alternative for treatment of mental health
consumers. Deinstitutionalisation should not, however be an excuse
for budget cuts or cost efficiency in an endeavor to balance a
governments books. Deinstitutionalisation can work provided there
is adequate resourcing, funding and enough qualified carers to
assist and be on call. A commitment to long term care of mental
health consumers should be an intrinsic part of the philosophy
behind Deinstitutionalisation. In Victoria, Deinstitutionalisation
cannot work until the lives and treatment of the patients come
before political ends.<BR>

<P>
Given the rapid rate of reform in Victoria one would expect the
government to want feedback, positive or negative on how the policy
is working and where the conflicts between the policy and its
implementation lie. Instead, we see the stifling of such comments
by alleged threats of retaliation or reprisal. Such a climate
of intimidation places significant restraint on fundamental democratic
principles such as freedom of speech. Where the people in the
front line who care for, have experience and expertise with mental
health consumers are ignored, how can real reform eventuate. It
must have taken great courage for those people who raised their
concern to come forward and speak to the inquiry.<BR>

<P>
Further, mental health consumers, their families, carers and community
legal centres must now deal with the fallout from access to adequate
services being denied- the shooting by police of mentally ill
persons, the suicides and attempted suicides of a large number
of mental health consumers. Afterwards, there is devastation caused
to those left behind- the families who tried to cope and support
the mentally ill person, the carers and psychiatrists who tried
to help but failed because of the inadequacies of the system.
My own discussions with parents of young persons who have suicided
(after being unable to access psychiatric care) also underline
the fact that there is no adequate nor easily decipherable complaints
mechanism within the Psychiatric Services Department where they
can express their concerns.<BR>

<P>
 Ms Tehan, the Health minister refers to increases in numbers
of registered patients, money being put into treatment services,
how her government spends more on mental health than any other
state and how there are 65 beds around the state for psychiatric
patients on a given night. These comments however don't sit easily
with the reality. Psychiatrists claim that they have to ring around
their friends to beg for beds(and state that they can't bear to
think who they are pushing out of a bed in the process). These
psychiatrists state that there may be 65 beds listed on the computer
but in reality they are either closed or awaiting a patient back
from leave. There may be an increase in the number of registered
patients but this says nothing about the quality and adequacy
of care they are receiving. If the government is spending so much
money why are there so many problems with resources and access
to hospitals. The question is how is the money being spent- is
it on economic consultants and management or is it being spent
on direct service provision and care for patients? <BR>

<P>
The government has done little to follow up on the recommendations
made in the Human Rights Commissioner's Report. The government
rather than addressing the concerns raised in the report merely
stated that the believed the allegations of intimidation unlikely.
It has still not addressed the other shortcoming in psychiatric
service delivery outlined in the Report. The government takes
a &quot;head in the sand&quot; approach quoting statistics that
mean little in the context of the unnecessary loss of life and
a number of acute crises likely to result from an inability to
access long term care.<BR>

<P>
It is a shame that human dignity, respect and quality care for
those with a mental illness has such a low priority in this state.
