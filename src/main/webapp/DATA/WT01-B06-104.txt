<P>
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is an independent,
nonprofit, scientific and educational organization dedicated to
reducing the losses resulting from crashes on the nation's highway.
The following facts are a result of a study they conducted in
1994. These statistics reflect the seriousness of the teenage
motor vehicle crash problem.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
In 1993, <b>5413 teenagers died</b> in the U.S. from motor vehicle
crash injuries.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
The motor vehicle death rate per 100,000 people is especially
high among 16-24 year olds.
The insurance injury claim frequencies and overall collision
losses for cars insured for teenagers to drive are<b> more than double 
</b>those of cars insured for adults.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Eighty-two percent of 16-year-old drivers in fatal crashes
during 1993 made at least one<b> driving error</b> that contributed to
the crashes.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Police reports indicate that 37 percent of all 16-year-old
drivers in fatal crashes during 1993 were reportedly <b>speeding</b>.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Forty-four percent of the 16-year-old drivers were in<b> fatal
crashes </b>that involved only the teen's vehicle.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Only 5 percent of all 16-year-old drivers killed in 1993 accidents
had blood <b>alcohol concentrations</b> of 0.10 or more.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Many of the 16-year-olds who die in crashes aren't using<b> seat
belts</b>.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Two out of every three teens who<b> died as passengers </b>in 1993
crashes were traveling in vehicles driven by other teens.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Insurance injury claim frequencies and overall collision losses
for cars insured for teenagers to drive are<b> more than double</b> those
of cars insured for use by adults only.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Collision <b>losses </b>for teenagers are highest for small and midsize
sports models.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3b.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
The vast majority of fatal crashes with a<b> 16 year-old at the
wheel</b> involved a driver leaving the roadway and overturning or
striking a fixed object or overturning on the roadway.
