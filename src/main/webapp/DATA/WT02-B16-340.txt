<h2>Wind Turbine Applications: Utility Programs</h2>
<strong>From DOE Wind Program Overview 3/95</strong>
</center>

<p><em>DOE is working with utilities to introduce advanced wind turbine technology
to the utility planners and engineers who will integrate tomorrow's
high-tech wind power plants into the utility grid.</em> 


<p>The U.S. utility industry is exploring wind as a new generation source. 
Dozens of electric utilities in 15 states are in the process of acquiring 
hands-on experience with wind power generation.  This unprecedented 
involvement with wind energy is a necessary precursor to the
widespread integration of wind into the U.S. utility grid.  Since 1990,  
DOE has worked with utilities and the wind industry to build a bridge 
between research and development (R&D) programs and the commercial use of 
utility-scale wind turbines.

<p>During FY 1994, utility plans for new wind projects more than doubled 
as a result of increased interest in renewable energy systems on the part 
of utility regulators and utilities.  To further encourage utilities to 
evaluate wind energy systems, DOE launched two multimillion-dollar 
deployment assistance programs.

<p>DOE announced plans in 1994 for a new Wind Turbine Deployment Project 
designed to help the United States meet national economic and 
environmental objectives.  DOE expects the initiative to result in 
commercial partnerships among U.S. utilities, independent power 
producers, and wind turbine manufacturers that will enhance the U.S. 
competitive position in domestic and international energy markets.  

<p>Under the cost-sharing initiative, DOE will contribute as much as 20% 
of the total cost for constructing a new 25-MW wind power plant, 
distributed wind system, or wind-diesel hybrid system.  (Utilities with a 
peak capacity of less than 100 MW will be allowed to propose smaller 
power plants under this initiative.)  DOE expects the enterprise to 
facilitate the introduction of new wind generation and help utilities 
reduce the perceived risk of introducing a new and unfamiliar technology.  DOE plans to collaborate in the development of as much as 500 MW of new wind generation in the United States and its territories by 2000.  NREL will issue a solicitation early in FY 1995 for developing the first power plants under this initiative.

<p>In a related endeavor to further wind energy development, NREL 
launched wind energy deployment, NREL launched the Sustainable Technology 
Energy Partnerships program in FY 1994.  Under this initiative, NREL will 
work with state energy offices throughout the nation to create 
partnerships with private industry, academia, and utilities for 
conducting pilot projects including wind technology deployment, resource 
assessment, and bird population studies.

<p>The Utility Wind Turbine Performance Verification Program is another 
major component of DOE 's efforts to demonstrate the value of wind energy 
to utilities.  The 5-year program is a joint effort between DOE and EPRI 
designed to reduce the risk of bringing advanced wind turbine technology 
into a utility setting for testing and evaluation.

<p>Participating utilities will build and operate a wind power plant of 
at least 6 MW that uses the latest technology.  They will select the wind 
power plant site, solicit bids from U.S. vendors, and purchase the 
turbines.  They will also be responsible for power plant design, 
construction, start-up, and 3 years of testing, evaluation, and 
documentation.  Such experience will allow utilities to make informed 
decisions when considering wind energy for replacing an outdated power 
plant or adding new capacity.

<p>Vermont's Green Mountain Power Corporation and Central and South West 
Services, Inc., were awarded $3.5 million and $2 million, respectively, 
during FY 1993 to participate in the program.  During that year, both 
utilities began the process of siting their facilities and applying for 
necessary permits.

<p>During FY 1994, Central and South West Services selected a power-plant 
site in southwest Texas near Fort Davis and initiated a study to monitor 
birds passing through the project area.  Central and South West Services 
also selected an advanced wind turbine for the power plant, the Z-40.  
The Z-40, developed under the auspices of DOE's Wind Turbine Development 
Program, is a 500-kW machine manufactured by Zond Systems, Inc. Central 
and South West will use 12 of the new machines in the demonstration power 
plant, scheduled to come on-line during FY 1995.

<p>Green Mountain Power continued its efforts to secure permits from the 
U.S.  Forest Service for a ridge-top east of Bennington, Vermont, during 
FY 1994.  Green Mountain Power plans to conduct interviews with potential 
turbine vendors in FY 1995.

<p>In late 1994, DOE and EPRI awarded Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation 
$1.5 million to participate in the Turbine Verification Program.  
Niagara Mohawk plans to build a 6-MW wind power plant by 1996 at a 
location not yet specified in New York.   Niagara Mohawk, which has 
announced plans to become the lead utility for wind in New York State, 
will receive an additional $1.5 million for the wind project from the New 
York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

<p>During FY 1994, DOE also supported the National Wind Coordinating 
Committee in initiating a cost-shared Utility Wind Resource Assessment 
Program.  The program will provide assistance to utilities in conducting 
their detailed wind resource measurements in their service territories or 
in other locations under consideration for siting a wind power plant to 
help launch the program, a meteorologist supported by the Edison Electric 
Institute and NREL developed specifications for standard instruments and 
procedures for evaluating wind resources.  The wind monitoring standards 
will ensure that uniform data is collected by participating utilities.  
About 10 utilities are expected to participate in the resource assessment 
program, which will be managed by the Utility Wind Interest Group.
