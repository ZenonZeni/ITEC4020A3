<hr><p>
<body>In 1982, Congress enacted the first comprehensive legislation regarding spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste disposal. This Federal law is called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.
Congress based this law on recommendations from groups such as the National Academy of
Sciences, the U.S. Geological Survey, and several professional scientific organizations. 
<p>
Spent nuclear fuel is the radioactive by-product of generating electricity at commercial nuclear
power plants. Most high-level radioactive waste is the by-product of production at defense
facilities. It is these categories of waste for which the Nuclear Waste Policy Act directs the
Department of Energy to develop a waste disposal system.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) within the Department of Energy to develop, construct, and operate a system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste disposal, including a permanent geologic repository, interim storage capability and a transportation system. 
<p>
Scientists have studied many options, including leaving the waste at the reactor sites, burying it
in the ocean floor, putting it in polar ice sheets, and rocketing it into outer space. Based on a final
Environmental Impact Statement prepared in 1980 that evaluated all of these options, deep
underground geologic disposal was determined to be the safest solution. 
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established a specific funding mechanism for developing the
waste disposal system, the Nuclear Waste Fund. Funds are collected from those who use
electricity produced by nuclear reactors rather than the general taxpayer. <a href="fundfct.htm">(See the fact sheet on Program Funding.)</a>
<p>
<strong>Site Selection Process</strong>
<p>
In the search for a site for the permanent repository, OCRWM had initially conducted a national
search for a potential site; eventually nine sites were chosen to be studied in six different states.
Then President Ronald Reagan approved three sites from a candidate list of five for more
detailed study, a process called site characterization. These locations were: Hanford, Washington;
Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
<p>
<strong>1987 Amendments</strong>
<p>
In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the
Department of Energy to study only one site, Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine whether it
was a suitable site for a repository. The Amendments Act directs that if, at any time Yucca
Mountain was found unsuitable, studies are to be stopped immediately, the site restored, and the
Department is to report to Congress within six months on a recommended course of action.
<p>
The Amendments Act also authorized the Secretary of Energy to site a Monitored Retrievable
Storage facility. This facility differs from the repository in that it is an above-ground facility that
would store a limited amount of spent nuclear fuel temporarily prior to sending it to a permanent
repository. It would also provide flexibility in the system while a repository is being built.
<p>
To facilitate siting an interim storage facility, Congress established the Office of the Nuclear
Waste Negotiator within the executive branch and independent from the Department of Energy.
The Negotiator was responsible for developing an agreement to host such a facility between any
willing volunteer and the Federal government. The agreement could include reasonable
incentives and financial arrangements, as well as various types of public programs, projects, and
problem-solving assistance. After an unsuccessful search for a volunteer host, the Office of the Negotiator
was terminated when Congress did not reauthorize funding for the office in 1995.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, also includes some additional requirements. It
requires spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to be transported in containers certified by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the same organization that must license permanent and interim
storage facilities. The amendments also require that the Department of Energy abide by
the regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding advance notification to States,
local governments and tribal officials prior to transportation. Also, the Department of Energy will
provide technical assistance and funding for safety and emergency response training of State,
local and tribal officials in affected areas. This funding is available in the planning stages in
preparation for future transportation of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
<strong>Independent Evaluation</strong>
<p>
The Amendments Act created the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board,
an independent establishment within the executive branch of the government.  The responsibility
of the Board is to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of OCRWM's activities. Members
are nominated by the National Academy of Sciences and appointed by the President to serve
terms of four years. The Board reports to Congress at least twice each year and presents
conclusions from investigations on the current program activities as well as recommendations.
