<body><H1>     The Training of Teachers for the Danish Folkeskole<br>
<h3> (Municipal Primary and Lower Secondary School)</h3>
                                    <!-- HER SÆTTES OVERSKRIFT IND --></H1>
<br><br><br><br><br><hr>
<b>At present, teacher training is offered at 18 colleges distributed all over Denmark.<br>
<br>
The colleges are administered by the Ministry of Education and are under ministry supervision both with regard to financing and to the education offered.<br>
The colleges of education are the only institutions which are authorized to provide the 4-year course, which qualifies for teaching posts in the Danish Folkeskole.<br></b></hr><br>
<b>Duration and Structure of the Course<br></b>
The teacher training course is of 4 years’ duration and consists of 2 parts, each of 2 years’ duration.<br>
<br>
The course includes teaching practice at a school for a total of 20 weeks, the organisation of which is decided by the individual institution.<br>
<br>
Part I of the course includes the following subjects: Danish, handwriting, rhetorics (about 32%) , religious education, history/social studies, arithmetic, natural science (about 18%), theory of education, psychology (about 20%) and 2 of the following 3 subjects: Music, physical education, visual art/design (about 20%) as well as teaching practice (about 10%).<br>
<br>
Part II of the course includes the following subjects: two main subjects chosen freely from among all the subjects of the Folkeskole (about 60%), general didactics and an educational specialization (about 25%) as well as teaching practice (about 15%).<br>
<br>
(The percentages indicate the proportion of a student’s fulltime workload devoted to these subjects during each of the two parts of the course).<p>
<b>Admission and Student Population<br></b>
The admission requirement for the teacher training course is one of the following leaving examinations at upper secondary level: the upper secondary school leaving examination (the “Studentereksamen”), the higher preparatory examination (the “HFeksamen”), the higher commercial examination (the “HHX”) or the higher technical examination (the “HTX”).<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that there are normally more applicants than available study places, it has been necessary to introduce restricted admission to the teachertraining courses.<br>
<br>
25% of the study places are awarded on the basis of the leaving examination at upper secondary level. As for the other 75%, it is in principle up to the colleges themselves to decide, but the colleges have agreed on common rules which are administered locally:<br>
<br>
         the result of the leaving examination (“the higher, the better”),<br>
   practical work experience,<br>
  folk high school attendance,<br>
        stay abroad,<br>
        experience with children (youth centre, boyscout movement etc.).<br>
<br>
1/3 of the students are men, 2/3 are women.<br>
<br>
About 55% of the students complete the course at the end of the officially stipulated time of study, and 75% in total complete the course.<br>
<br>
<b>Legislation<br></b>
Act no 410 of 6 June 1991 on the Training of Teachers for the Danish Folkeskole only indicates the general lines of the course: the duration, subjects, rules regarding the institutions and their management etc.<br>
<br>
Ministerial order no 261 of 15 April 1992 regulates the scope of the subjects, the principal lines of the content of the subjects, and general rules for the assesment of students.<br>
<br>
The more detailed regulations are laid down in local curricula drawn up by the institutions.<br>
<br>
<b>Administration<br></b>
Each school has a board consisting of 515 members representing local interests (the municipality, trade unions, folk high schools, municipal primary and lower secondary schools etc.).<br>
<br>
The board shall safeguard “the interests of the college as an educational institution and decide on the guidelines for the external work of the college and the development in the long term”. The board is furthermore responsible for the running of the college, including the administration of the budget.<br>
<br>
The rector is responsible for the daytoday running of the college, i.e. the teaching and finances of the college.<br>
<br>
Teachers’ and students’ councils may be established.<br>
<br>
<b>Qualifications of the Teachers at the Colleges of Education<br></b>
The teachers at the colleges of education may have 3 different kinds of qualifications:<br>
<br>
1. A university degree (Master’s level) in humanities or in natural sciences subjects,<br>
2.       An academic degree (Master’s level) from the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies,<br>
3.  A Folkeskole teacher qualification supplemented with inservice training (mostly in nonacademic subjects such as textile design, handwriting etc.).<br>
<br>
<b>Economy<br></b>
The budget is based on the number of active students, i.e. students who pass the prescribed examinations within the officially stipulated time of study.<br>

Expenses relating to the teaching, materials, teaching practice and administration are based on this. Expenses relating to buildings, cleaning, energy/heating and rent are based on  individual circumstances.<br>

About 80% of the budget go to the payment of salaries. And the remaining 20% cover the operational expenditure. <br>
<br>
The total cost of one student was DKK 50,000 per year in 1995.<br>
<br>
<b>The Competence of Danish Folkeskole Teachers<br></b>
A Danish teacher’s certificate obtained at a college of education is based on a leaving examination at upper secondary level, and the course is of 4 years’ duration.<br>

The colleges of education are the only institutions which are authorized to provide the 4year course, which qualifies for teaching posts in the Danish Folkeskole .<br>

Danish colleges of education offer a course which in scope and level can be said to correspond to certain types of university courses in the Englishspeaking world. The qualification which students obtain on completion of the course can most aptly be compared to a UK/US Bachelor’s degree.<br>
<br>
All the colleges are under ministry supervision. The quality of the examinations is controlled by external examiners appointed by the ministry.<br>
<br>
In theory, a teacher’s certificate qualifies the graduate teacher to teach all subjects to all forms (1st  10th forms), but in fact the teacher is generally considered competent to teach the 1st to 10th forms in the main subjects taken, the 1st to 7th forms in Danish, arithmetic and religious education and the lower forms in the core subjects taken.<br>
<br>
In practice, the authorities responsible for the appointment of teachers (i.e. the municipalities, including the school board and the headteacher of the individual school) take the final decision with regard to the question of competence.<br>
