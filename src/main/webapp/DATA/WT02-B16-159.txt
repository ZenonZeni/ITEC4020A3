        <td valign="top" width="640">Many <a
        href="buildings.html">Office of Building Technology,
        State and Community Program (BTS)</a> programs develop
        software tools to help researchers, designers,
        architects, engineers, builders, code officials, and
        others involved in the building life-cycle to evaluate
        and rank potential energy-efficiency technologies and
        renewable energy strategies in new or existing buildings.<p>This
        electronic directory provides information on more than 70
        tools--from research grade software to commercial
        products with thousands of users. The common thread for
        all the software is improving energy efficiency or
        incorporating renewable energy concepts in buildings.
        Many tools in the first version (August 1996) were
        sponsored by DOE at some point in their life-cycle.</p>
        <p>The energy tools in this directory include databases,
        spreadsheets, component and systems analyses, and
        whole-building energy performance simulation programs.
        For each tool in the directory, a short description is
        provided along with other information including expertise
        required, users, audience, input, output, computer
        platforms, programming language, strengths, weaknesses,
        technical contact, and availability.</p>
        <p>The directory is organized in four major categories
        with subcategories</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole-Building Analysis</li>

        <p>When you click on a category, a list of tools will
        appear along with descriptive information including applicability
        to building life-cycle phase, building type, system,
        equipment, or other important capabilities. <a
