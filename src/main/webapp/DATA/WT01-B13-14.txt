<IMG SRC="gifs/funds_vs_dividends_head.gif" ALT="The Difference Between
Mutual Fund And Stock Dividends">
<BR>

Many mutual fund shareholders mistakenly believe that a mutual fund
dividend is similar to a dividend declared by a corporation.
Corporations that pay dividends are returning a share of their profits
to their shareholders, an interim means of rewarding shareholders for
their investment. Investors have reason to be encouraged when a company
declares consecutive dividends or dividend increases. Conversely, a cut
in dividends often suggests that something is amiss.
<P>

A change in the dividend paid by a mutual fund is normally much less
meaningful. The dividend level represents the income that the fund has
earned on its investments - interest on the bonds held in an income fund
portfolio or dividends on stocks in an equity fund portfolio. Because
interest rates and the financial markets tend to move in cycles, you can
always expect some fluctuation in the income earned by your fund.
Regardless of these fluctuations, mutual funds distribute substantially
all of their income annually in order to avoid paying income tax on
their earnings.
<P>

When interest rates rise and a fund can earn more on its underlying
investments, the dividends it pays may be expected to rise. By the same
token, a drop in interest rates over an extended period of time will
result in a reduction in the interest income earned by a fund. This
decline in income earned may result in the fund being forced to cut the
dividends paid to shareholders.
<P>

Dividend income is only one way that your investment in a mutual fund
can grow. You also have the opportunity to receive capital gains
distributions, which are distributions of any profits that your fund
earns when it sells securities. Another possibility is the capital gain
(or loss) you experience when you sell your shares at a higher (or
lower) share price than your cost per share.
