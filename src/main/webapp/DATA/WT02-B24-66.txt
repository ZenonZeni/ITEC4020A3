<p><b>Public Affairs Committee<br>
July 1996</b>

<p>Congress probably will not be in session for the month of August and will 
adjourn the beginning of October. Because so few days are left for legislative 
action, leaders in both the House and the Senate are reluctant to move any 
controversial or time-consuming bills to the floor. Among the bills in this 
category are IDEA, the Job Training (Careers) Bill, the Kennedy  Kassenbaum 
Health Care Bill, and Welfare Reform. Any bills not passed by the end of the 
session must be reintroduced in the 105th Congress to be sworn in on January 
20, 1997.

<p><b>Will there be a new IDEA? Would it be good or bad? No one knows</b><br>
The House version of IDEA was passed by voice vote of the full House on June 
10. The Senate Labor and Human Services Committee passed their version of IDEA 
in March and asked that it be sent to the floor under unanimous consent rule. 
(Unanimous consent means no debate and no amendments.) However, Senator Gorton 
(R WA) (who has announced his intention of offering amendments 1) to severely 
limit attorneys fees and 2) to deny punitive damages under IDEA; and Senator 
Ashcroft (R MO) (who has announced his intention of offering amendments 1) to 
require administrators to document violent acts on a student's IEP which would 
be passed on to any new school attended by that student and 2) to allow schools
to deny educational services to violent students) have placed holds on the 
bill, which means that it cannot move. Both disability and regular education 
groups have been trying to get the bill passed in the Senate, so a conference 
committee can be named to come up with a final bill. A number of disability 
groups fear that, flawed as the current bills are, the 105th Congress could 
pass a worse one. Moreover, failure to pass a bill would not guarantee that 
Senators Gorton and Ashcroft would not put their amendments on any new bill 
in the Congress. A number of regular education groups seem to feel that the 
current bills are better for them than the current law. However, others are 
hoping that the 105th Congress could pass an even weaker IDEA.

<p>The recent federal appeals court ruling that public schools must continue 
to serve students with disabilities who are suspended or expelled may change 
the equation. Virginia, which brought the suit, has not yet decide whether to 
appeal the decision. In the meantime, school systems in Maryland, Virginia, 
West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina must serve all students with 
disabilities. The decision may not sit well with the National School Boards 
Association and the American Federation of Teachers, both of which support the 
current proposals which allow denial of educational services to students with 
disabilities who bring a weapon or drugs to school and whose behavior is found 
not to be a manifestation of their disability. KEEP TUNED ON IDEA.

<p><b>Appropriations</b><br>
The House Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations
Subcommittee passed a bill which would level funds to all programs under IDEA.
The Senate has yet to act. Even if IDEA is not reauthorized, the discretionary
programs will not be affected in the 1997 appropriations. However, there will 
be real problems with the 1998 appropriations if the discretionary programs 
are not reauthorized.

<p><b>The Jobs Training Bill</b><br>
Different versions of federal job training programs consolidation were passed 
in the House and the Senate. Although conferees have been working since last 
October, major issues between Republicans and Democrats have not been resolved.
If, as threatened, the Republication majority pass a conference bill, it will 
face a floor filibuster and a presidential veto.

<p><b>The Kennedy Kassenbaum Health Care Bill</b><br>
This bill would prohibit the denial of insurance coverage because of a
pre-existing condition. However, further action has been delayed because of 
concerns about proposals to allow medical savings accounts.

<p><b>Welfare Reform</b><br>
Congress hopes to get some version of welfare reform passed before adjournment.
Disability advocates are concerned about proposals to eventually eliminate 
over 350,000 children with disabilities because of changing eligibility.

<p><b>Bills which could have an impact on individuals with disabilities</b><br>
The following bills, which are being monitored by various coalitions, could 
have an impact on individuals with learning disabilities.
<blockquote>
<p><b>The Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act</b> (S88, HR 2086), which 
allows states or localities to submit "flexibility or coordination plans" for 
any federal program under which financial assistance is available. This plan 
can include requests to waive virtually any local, state, or federal law or 
regulation. Although civil rights under the ADA, Section 504 and IDEA cannot 
be waived, a state or community could decide to use IDEA funds for general 
education rather than for special education services for children with 
disabilities. For further information, contact

<p><b>The Parents Rights and Responsibilities Act</b> (HR 1946, SR 92) would 
prohibit any government official from interfering with a parent's desires in 
the areas of medical care, discipline, home schooling, and religious education.
Sixty organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are 
opposing this bill.

<p>Remember <b>the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations 
(ACIR)</b>? The original report of the ACIR, which was established by the 
Unfunded Mandates Act, recommended changes in both the ADA and IDEA, despite 
the fact that both laws were exempted from the mandate. The draft of ACIR's 
final report does not mention the ADA. However, it repeats the recommendation 
that IDEA be funded to pay for 40% of excess costs and amended to relieve 
state and local governments from prescriptive, administrative, and 
recordkeeping requirements and to foster increased use of mediation and other 
forms of alternative dispute resolution. However, the original recommendation 
to prohibit a private right of action, i.e., due process, by parents has been 
dropped.
