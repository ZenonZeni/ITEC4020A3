</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">This paper argues that the so-called
cannabis 'amotivation syndrome', widely reported in the
literature, may not be a single nosological entity, but
represent, instead, a change in cognitive style emerging as a
result of cannabis's ability to facilitate a unique attentional
state favoured by those who have a higher than average level of a
personality factor referred to as 'trait absorption'.
Exaggeration of the absorptive style of cognition through
cannabis use, when taken in the context of either a pre-existing
or a reactive depression, may be what has been mistakenly
categorized as 'amotivational syndrome'.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">In spite of the pressure of increasing
law enforcement campaigns and more sophisticated educational
endeavours in Australia and other Western democracies, cannabis
is not apparently losing its attractiveness to many young people
[1]. One of the major concerns expressed by those who are
attempting to reduce cannabis use in the young is the occurrence
amongst users of a collocation of behaviours and attitudes
collectively referred to as the 'amotivational syndrome' [2, 3].
This presumed psychological syndrome is believed to be a direct
result of regular, heavy cannabis use and leaves those so
affected reduced in motivation and capacity for the usual
activities required for achievement and success in today's world.
Although many anti-cannabis campaigners accept, <i>a priori,</i>
the existence of the 'amotivational syndrome', there is still
some considerable debate as to whether it is an actual
nosological entity and whether all cannabis users are so
effected.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">This article will argue that
'amotivational syndrome' is not, in fact, a single entity, but,
rather, a collection of behaviours which emerge as the result of
the combination of the effects of an already existent or a
reactive depression occurring concomitantly with cannabis's
ability to facilitate a unique attentional state favoured by
those who have a higher than average level of a personality
factor referred to as 'trait absorption' [4]. Thus, the apparent
loss of motivation for many socially accepted behaviours and
tasks as well as the changes in attitude and cognitive style
associated with cannabis use may represent a re-orientation in
attentional style, meaning and values rather than merely a
collapse into pharmacologically induced pathology. So, it may be
that cannabis is not being predicably affected by educational or
law enforcement programs because the urge to use the drug arises
for many from a primary psychological need which far outweighs
the power of those sorts of external pressures. The primary
personality 'need' being described here is the propensity of
certain individuals to seek and choose to experience 'flow' [5]
or 'absorptive' states for their own sake because of their
intrinsic self-rewarding qualities.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">In order to explore the possible
relationship between 'trait absorption' and apparent
'amotivational syndrome' this paper will first present a review
of the 'amotivational syndrome' literature followed by a
delineation of the personality factor, 'trait absorption'. In the
final section a re-examination of 'amotivational syndrome' will
be undertaken in the light of the discussion of the absorptive
personality type and the unique styles of attention deployment
preferred by these individuals. Further, it will be suggested
that not only are attempts by cannabis users to augment the
'absorptive' cognitive style not pathological, but this type of
behaviour may be seen as a healthy sign of a striving to
re-balance cognitive 'style' from over-dependence on the active,
achieving, doer mode of the post-industrial age to the
'receptive' style of the visionary and mystic more reminiscent of
traditional spirituality and artistically creative life-styles
[43].<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Cannabis research has, for the past
three decades, failed to reach any unassailable conclusions
regarding long-term psychological effects of the drug on
otherwise normal, healthy users [6, 7, 8, 9, 45, 46]. Research
has been, at best, problematic, taking place in the midst of a
highly emotionally charged debate. Pharmacologically, when
cannabis is ingested the primary psycho-active ingredient,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), rapidly disappears from the
blood plasma and is taken up in fat where it remains with a half
life decay rate of 5-7 days. This means that following a single
dose of THC, less than 1% of the primary active ingredient
remains in fatty tissue after approximately 35-50 days [10].
THC's oil solubility, and thus its high affinity for fatty
tissue, probably accounts for its attraction to neural tissue
with its high lipid content. Although, in the case of light to
moderate cannabis users THC can be detected in body fluids for
approximately 30 days after the last consumption, it is quite
difficult to detect perceptual-motor effects this long after a
given average single dose (1-3 mg THC in cannabis to be smoked).
This is unlike alcohol where a clear dose/response curve is
demonstrable in which effects of ethanol on behaviour and
judgement can be demonstrated at blood levels below 0.05% [11].</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">These properties of long half-life and
high intoxicant activity of THC have been a major confounding
factor in previous clinical and closed ward behavioural and
performance studies of the effects of cannabis in humans [9]. The
high dose rates of the typical chronic cannabis user recruited
for many of these studies, when taken in the context of the
relatively long half-life of THC, suggest that behavioural and
psychological tests conducted on chronic users, who are
supposedly no longer using cannabis, are, in fact, being carried
out on individuals still somewhat intoxicated [9, 12]. Hence, any
ascriptions of permanent neurological, behavioural, cognitive or
affective changes due to cannabis are often confounded. In
addition, as will be argued later in this paper, cannabis appears
to facilitate the learning of cognitive styles which emphasize
capacities quite different from and contrary to those required
for doing well on most psychological performance tests.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">From the recent work of Herkenham <i>et
al</i> [13] in mapping the distribution of cannabis binding sites
in the brain there is no doubt that the cannabinols have
affinities for certain brain structures. However, it is as yet
unclear as to whether cannabis has any predictable specific
behavioural, cognitive, and/or affective consequences resulting
from the particular receptor site bindings mapped in their study.
To date it is not possible to describe a unique and repeatable
constellation of psychological responses to the action of the
cannabinols as is possible for the opiate derivatives or the
neuroleptic compounds used in the treatment of schizophrenia [9].
This observation alone must cast some considerable doubt on most
psychopharmacological ascriptions made for the actions of the
cannabinols in the human central nervous system.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">There is little doubt, however, that
cannabis has some effect on the nervous system during acute
intoxication. This can be seen from the wide variety of
psychological changes reported by users and observed by
researchers. Weller [14] summarizes a number of findings across a
variety of studies which purport to delineate psychological
profiles due to the effect of cannabis. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">One study found that marijuana users
were more impulsive and nonconforming than nonusers. Another
study discovered more &quot;psychiatric impairment&quot; in users
based on personality tests. A self-administered drug survey
conducted at two colleges found that users were less likely to be
at the top of their class, had looser religious ties, and were
more dissatisfied with school. They were also more likely to be
bored, anxious, cynical, disgusted, moody, impulsive, rebellious,
or restless. In still another study, marijuana users were more
opposed than nonusers to external control and likely to use the
drug to relieve tension (p.101).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">However, he criticises these
characterisations by arguing that little effort has been made to
determine the personality types and differences before subjects
became involved in a cannabis 'lifestyle'. Thus, it is arguable
that any ascription of personality type or permanent behavioural
effects of cannabis on users must be seen as somewhat spurious.
This logical error of explaining the behaviour of cannabis users,
<i>post hoc,</i> in the absence of within-subject controls,
appears to be a commonly repeated one throughout the cannabis
literature. On the other hand, Weil's [15] argument that cannabis
is an &quot;active placebo&quot; (p. 95), which facilitates
already existent covert behaviours and pathologies, offers an
equally credible explanation for most observations made
concerning pathological syndromes associated with cannabis use.
In addition, Weil's view has the added benefit of accounting for,
in part, the great variation seen from individual to individual
when intoxicated with THC. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">One such constellation of behaviours,
which has been repeatedly claimed as a unique nosological entity
peculiar to chronic cannabis users, has been labelled
'amotivational syndrome' [2, 3, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
McGlothlin and West first reported that regular cannabis use can
lead to the development of passive, inward-turning, amotivational
personality characteristics. At about the same time, Smith made a
similar observation, based on several young marijuana users, that
regular cannabis ingestion leads to a loss of desire to compete
and work which, like McGlothlin and West, he labelled
'amotivational syndrome'. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Weller [14] describes the origins and
general characteristics associated with this hypothesized
syndrome.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">This contention was based on clinical
observation of middle-class, heavy marijuana users referred to
them for treatment. Conforming, achievement-oriented behaviour
had changed to relaxed and careless drifting. Inability to
concentrate for long periods, endure frustration, follow
routines, and carry out complex, long-term plans, as well as
apathy and loss of effectiveness, were noted. Such individuals
became totally involved with the present at the expense of future
goals. They had less objective productivity and seemed to
withdraw subtly from the challenge of life (pp. 95, 98).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">He reminds us, however, that no specific
studies or case reports were cited to support McGlothlin and
West's observations [2]. </font></p>

<p>Other descriptions noted which apparently characterize this
syndrome include: shift or decline in ambition; unproductiveness;
aimlessness; poor class attendance; lack of goals; poor school
performance; apathy and sluggishness in mental and physical
responses; disorientation; flattening of affect; loss of interest
in personal appearance; physical exhaustion; loss of time sense;
difficulty with recent memory; mental confusion; and depression
[14, 21, 22, 45, 46]. Nevertheless, in most cases symptoms
disappeared if marijuana was discontinued suggesting not so much
a syndrome but behaviour of chronically intoxicated individuals
using their intoxicated state as a way of focusing their
resentment of social and parental pressure. Moreover, Maugh
states, from his summary of research conducted prior to 1974,
that the amotivation symptoms listed above have been known to
persist in some cases for up to 24 months after cessation of drug
use. </p>

<p>Weller cites Halikas <i>et al's</i> summary of the medical
literature which suggests a reduction in levels of sperm and
testosterone in men as a result of chronic cannabis use [14, 21].
The latter change was observed in a closed ward situation with
subjects at first showing no alteration in testosterone levels
for about four weeks, followed by a subsequent and gradual drop
in testosterone level which continued until cannabis intake
stopped. This situation reversed itself on cessation of cannabis
intake with levels beginning to rise after one week's abstinence.
Weller concludes that &quot;if testosterone affects aggression
and drive, low testosterone might affect motivation. However,
this relationship must be considered hypothetical without
additional research (p. 102).&quot; </p>

<p>Carlin and Post observed, in the 226 subjects they studied, an
inverse relationship between levels of marijuana consumption and
rate of employment, successful completion of school, present
enrolment in school and the number of years of education
completed [16]. A later study by Creason and Goldman affirmed
this assessment when it was found that high school students who
are heavy users and ex-users of cannabis are significantly lower
on a behavioural measure of motivation than are casual and
nonusers [17]. However, these authors suggest that &quot;heavy
marijuana use is limited to those who are already inclined to low
motivation and depression&quot; (p. 452) and in yet another, but
related study, assessment was undertaken of 237 students in a
Central European sports training facility for lifetime prevalence
of amotivational syndrome [18]. This study, in contrast to that
of Carlin and Post, reveals that 'amotivational syndrome' is not
significantly associated with a history of marijuana use. In
addition to the survey assessments provided by the above studies,
Foltin <i>et al,</i> using an experimental design consisting of a
structured performance task in the presence and absence of
behavioural contingency requirements, found that in a comparison
of cannabis users to no-drug and placebo conditions smoked
marijuana was associated with a greater decrease in the use of
time earned to perform high probability activities during
contingency periods [19]. These findings are interpreted by the
authors as evidence of an 'amotivational' effect which may result
from repeated use of smoked marijuana. </p>

<p>In a large-scale study Mullins <i>et al</i> examined the drug
consumption habits of recent conscripts into the United States
Air Force who were, for the most part, young, healthy and not
psychiatrically morbid [20]. The authors compared 2,842 US Air
Force trainees who had used only cannabis with 1,843 who had used
cannabis and/or other drugs and with a control sample of 9,368 on
whom no drug-using information was available. Comparisons were
made on five separate aptitude measures, on educational level
attained prior to enlistment, and on three measures of
performance of Air Force duties. It was found that every mean
score for the drug using groups was significantly different from
its control counterpart at p = 0.01 or better. The most
intriguing finding, in light of the authors' conclusion that
cannabis causes an 'amotivational syndrome', is that for level of
performance &quot;all means are significantly lower than the
control mean except the means for the cannabis-only group, which
are significantly higher than the control means&quot; (p. 4).
Moreover, the authors argue that the differences between the
cannabis-only group and the other drug groups, regarding level of
performance, may be the result of the degree of drug use. They
assert that multiple drug takers are more likely to be heavy
users as opposed to the cannabis-only group which they claim are
more likely to be light to moderate users. Thus, the lower means
for the multiple drug groups are interpreted as resulting from
the total overall consumption of drugs rather than the mixing of
mind-altering substances which, like the mixture of cannabis and
alcohol, may interact synergistically [6]. </p>

<p>Congruent with the superior performance findings of Mullins <i>et
al</i> are the results of Brill and Christie who observed, in a
longitudinal study (1970-72) of marijuana use amongst 1,380
American college students, that a great majority either
experienced &quot;no effect&quot; on adjustment or
&quot;improved&quot; adjustment with only a small minority
claiming their situation to be worsened [23]. In confirmation of
this self-report evidence the students' grade-point averages
showed no significant difference between cannabis user and
non-user groups. In a similar study on a sample of 560 college
students who were primarily cannabis-only users (85-90%), Goode
found that grade-point averages for the casual and infrequent
users to be higher than for non-users but slightly worse
(non-significant) for heavy users as compared to abstainers [24].
This appears to suggest that 'amotivational syndrome' is not
inevitable amongst a normal college population of marijuana
smokers and the syndrome, if it exists, may be associated with
heavy use only. </p>

<p>In his review of the cannabis literature Cohen reminds us that
the 'amotivational syndrome' is so variable in presentation and
is influenced by the magnitude and type of any premorbid
pathology, that the very existence of such a syndrome must remain
quite controversial [6]. On the other hand, it is the observation
of both this author and Cohen that apparent lethargy and loss of
ambition and goal orientation persist for some time during
intervals of withdrawal from cannabis. In many cases this anergic
condition is apparently reversed after months of abstinence, but
Cohen reports that some clinicians recount what they believe to
be the occurrence of permanent brain dysfunction in some subjects
studied. However, it is interesting to note that Thurlow observed
that cannabis users who complained of apathy and loss of
motivation improved when treated with antidepressant medication
[25]. </p>

<p>Another interpretation of the symptoms of 'amotivational
syndrome' offered by some researchers is that it may be a
facilitated depressive disorder which is brought to the fore by
chronic, heavy cannabis use in a minority of pre-disposed
individuals. Although Creason and Goldman argue for the existence
of an 'amotivational syndrome', they conclude that marijuana
consumption among adolescents exists across a wide range of youth
groups, but heavy marijuana consumption appears to be limited to
those who seem already inclined to low motivation and depression
[17]. Kupfer <i>et al</i> draw a similar conclusion in an earlier
study in which they compare 46 and 44 male undergraduates who
were, respectively, heavy and light marijuana smokers [26].
However, their findings do not suggest any particular
psychopathology associated with either group and these authors
propose that heavy use of cannabis may be related to already
existing depression which is, itself, the source of impaired
motivation rather than frequent marijuana use. </p>

<p>Halikas <i>et al</i> also report a high incidence of
depressive disorder in regular cannabis users who had smoked at
least fifty times in the past six months before the commencement
of the study [21]. Weller indicates that an examination of the
subjects of that study reveals that most were young (mean age =
22 years), middle-class and had been smoking cannabis for an
average of 2 years [14]. &quot;Systematic evaluation revealed
that most of their psychiatric problems predated marijuana use.
About 18% had a history of definite or probable depression before
significant marijuana use (p. 102).&quot; </p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the subjects of many of those
studies which identify 'amotivational syndrome' as a product of
cannabis use have been referred for treatment and hence do not
represent the population of cannabis users in general. In fact,
from the numbers given in many sources, those presenting with
psychopathologies of any kind represent a very small minority
indeed. For example, the 1991 National Campaign Against Drug
Abuse survey of drug use in Australia reveals that 31.9% of
Australians 14 years and older have tried cannabis at least once,
7.1% have used it within the past month, and 5.4% within the last
week [44]. Thus, there are just under a million regular cannabis
users in Australia who apparently function well enough so that
most do not come to the attention of medical or legal
authorities. Therefore, if 'amotivational syndrome' was a fact of
cannabis use, Australian society would unmistakably feel its
impact more directly and distinctly than is actually the case.
One can only conclude that this supposed 'syndrome' may be, in
part, the mis-labelling of a latent affect disorder which, in a
small minority of unfortunate individuals, becomes manifest when
facilitated by chronic cannabis use. </p>

<p>From the findings of Creason and Goldman, it appears that the
effect of heavy cannabis use on motivation is not dependent on
the presence of the drug in the user's system [17]. Although
their work more precisely operationalizes the concept of
'motivation', which is central to the 'amotivational syndrome'
debate, it is, perhaps, too narrow a definition when attempting
to delineate the complex constellation of social-psychological
changes seen in chronic cannabis users. For them motivation
merely becomes <br>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">...the difference between the subject's
performance on a task [solution of anagrams] when working for a
reward and when the subject is not externally motivated [working
for a reward]. A subject who performed better working for a
reward than when not was considered more motivated than a subject
who performed at the same level regardless of whether there was a
reward at stake (p. 448). (Brackets mine)<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">From their results, in which they
observed diminished motivation in heavy users and ex-users, they
hypothesize the existence of a possible intervening personality
variable as the possible distinguishing characteristic which
separates those who are high users and high ex-users from casual
or non-users and &quot;that this factor is independent of present
marijuana use while it does make the subject more likely to use
marijuana&quot; (17, p. 452). In conclusion they argue that there
is good evidence in the research literature to suggest that
intense cannabis use may be limited to those who have an
inclination towards low motivation and depression. Unfortunately,
these authors were not able to assess for any possible
pre-existing psychiatric morbidity or personality differences
which may have indicated either prior psychiatric conditions or
differences in personality driven motivational levels in heavy
users before the commencement of their cannabis habits.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Summarizing thus far: although
researchers have apparently identified a group of cannabis
consumers who undergo some changes in life-style and motivation,
the existence of 'amotivation syndrome' as a nosological entity
seems somewhat doubtful for at least five reasons. First, most
studies cited thus far are unable to disconfound prior existing
psychiatric morbidities from any effect directly caused by
cannabis. Second, and closely related, is the difficulty in
separating cannabis as catalytic facilitator of a covert but
developing psychopathology from cannabis as causal agent in the
onset of depression, loss of motivation, etc. Third, many of the
studies examined above were conducted without properly
contextualizing the social circumstances of those being studied
(e.g., Kolansky and Moore [45]). Research on motivation,
adherence to educational courses and behaviour changes associated
with cannabis use conducted in the 1960's and 1970's are
confounded with the effect of changing social values, rebellious
attitudes to the 'system' and alternative life-style worldviews
which were prevalent at the times of those studies. Fourth, the
research results on and pattern of this supposed syndrome contain
too much contradictory evidence to pass the most basic test of
empirical consistency required for sound scientific
conceptualization as a single dynamic entity. Fifth, and most
importantly from the perspective of this paper, no pre-test,
post-test long-term longitudinal studies have been conducted
which attempt to identify personality traits associated with
chronic cannabis usage.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Returning to the interpretation of
'amotivational syndrome' as given in Creason and Goldman, it can
be argued that the explanatory intervening personality variable
posited by these authors (to account for increased cannabis use
and subsequent loss of motivation in the cognitive,
perceptual-motor tasks typically employed in most performance
studies) is what Tellegen and Atkinson have called 'trait
absorption' [4, 17]. It can be hypothesized that those who become
heavy cannabis users (and show signs of 'amotivational syndrome')
are doing so because the intoxicant properties of THC augment and
facilitate this given personality trait in a manner which is
self-rewarding. Of course, the inherent danger of any
self-rewarding system is the formation of an uncontrollable
positive feedback loop which leads to ever increasing levels of
consumption of the facilitating substance - in this case
cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is being hypothesized herein that the
so-called 'amotivational syndrome' does not represent a specific
psychiatric nosology but is, rather, the combination of two
general factors arising from heavy cannabis use brought about by
a personality-need driven positive feedback loop. With regular
cannabis use is observed: <br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">1) a change in cognitive style to a more
'absorptive' state in which externally driven reward systems no
longer predominate with subsequent reduction in a user's level of
achievement motivation; and<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">2) the development of depression which
sometimes ensues either as a consequence of a prior existing
pathology or as a result of the user being unable to sustain the
desired 'absorption' state for reasons arising as a result of
social circumstances, changing self-concept engendered by the
cannabis-induced state and/or the development of increased
tolerance to the effects of THC.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">However, before discussing the possible
mechanisms entailed by the above hypotheses, the personality
factor of 'trait absorption' requires further elucidation.<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>TRAIT
ABSORPTION<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It has been argued in recent years that
'flow' states of consciousness and/or 'absorption' experiences
may represent a basic human personality trait which has, as its
primary drive, the need to experience the world in a
self-absorbed state of consciousness which is <i>intrinsically
self-rewarding</i> [4, 5]. This need varies from one individual
to another and, in some, the achievement of this state may become
an end in itself. Tellegen and Atkinson describe the origins and
qualities of what they call trait absorption. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Phenomena of this kind, while apparently
overlooked by contemporary academic treatments of attention,
perception, and memory, have been described and discussed widely
in literature on meditation, expanded awareness, peak
experiences, mysticism, aesthetic experience, regression in the
service of the ego, altered states of consciousness, and in the
literature on drug effects. For example, Maslow spoke of the
&quot;fascination&quot; and &quot;complete absorption&quot; that
characterize peak experiences [27]. Schachtel, to whom Maslow
refers, described the &quot;allocentric&quot; perceptual mode as
involving &quot;totality of interest&quot; [28, p.221], and
openness to the object in all its aspects with all one's senses,
including one's kinesthetic experience. We suggest, in a similar
vein, that the attention described in Absorption items is a
&quot;total&quot; attention, involving a full commitment of
available perceptual, motoric, imaginative and ideational
resources to a unified representation of the attentional object
(p.274).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The absorptive state favoured by those
with high levels of trait absorption is the likely basis for all
'flow' experiences. In this state of consciousness the
individual's attentional resources are focused in such a manner
as to enter wholly into whatever is in awareness, whether the
focus be interoceptive or exteroceptive [29]. This totality of
awareness on the side of the 'object' has been called by Sartre
and other phenomenologists 'unreflected' consciousness [30]. Most
of our waking state is spent in 'reflected' consciousness in
which attentional resources are divided between the 'object' and
'self-as-object' so that we are simultaneously experiencing the
'object' and ourselves doing the experiencing. It is in this
latter state that experience becomes memory and hence knowledge
and it is also in this state that we operate in what is generally
understood to be our normal linguistic, discursive mental
processes which includes our usual awareness of the passage of
time [31].</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Irwin further discriminates between the
'capacity' and 'opportunity' for 'absorption' as determining
whether individuals engage experiential states which are derived
from deploying attentional resources in this particular way [32].
Further, the 'capacity' for engaging in 'absorptive' states has
been standardized as a personality construct and is therefore
measurable as a scale (Absorption) on a self-administering
personality instrument - the Tellegen Differential Personality
Questionnaire, and this personality 'capacity' has been found to
be able to successfully differentiate levels of hypnotic
susceptibility as well as frequency and type of reported
spontaneous mystical, visionary, and paranormal experiences [4,
32, 33, 34, 35, 47].</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Finally, trait absorption may underlie
what Weil has argued is a fundamental need in Homo Sapiens across
cultures and time: the drive to engage altered states of
consciousness for both ritualistic and creative developmental
purposes [15]. In traditional societies, such as once existed
amongst the Yakut of Siberia and the Australian Aborigines, an
individual with a strong natural proclivity for altered state
experiences would be, as a matter of course, chosen for a
life-role as shaman or 'clever man' [36, 37]. However, this role
no longer exists in the developed countries of the late Twentieth
Century. Thus, individuals who possess high 'trait absorption'
and/or are inclined toward spontaneous 'absorptive' and trance
experiences may find themselves making a &quot;deviant role
exit&quot; into alternative lifestyles, such as the cannabis
sub-culture, more frequently than those with less 'absorptive'
'capacity' in order to create greater 'absorptive' 'opportunity'
[32, 38].<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>A
RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRAIT ABSORPTION
AND AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">In contrast to the view that cannabis is
psychologically dangerous in itself, Weil has argued that it
should be understood to be what he calls an &quot;active
placebo&quot; [15]. Weil describes an &quot;active placebo&quot;
as &quot;a substance whose apparent effects on the mind are
actually placebo effects in response to minimal physiological
action&quot; (p. 95) rather than being a direct cause of the
psychological changes seen in users. This effect is attested to,
empirically, by the wide variety of responses individuals make to
similar batches of cannabis in similar situations. Weil's notion,
based on hundreds of clinical observations, led him to argue that
it was highly unlikely that cannabis alone could be responsible
for the very varied psychological responses and effects which he
observed. He provides a useful insight into the reasons for the
varied outcomes seen across cannabis motivation studies.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Because marijuana is such an
unimpressive pharmacological agent, it is not a very interesting
drug to study in a laboratory. Pharmacologists cannot get a
handle on it with their methods, and because they cannot see the
reality of the nonmaterial state of consciousness that users
experience, they are forced to design experimental situations
very far removed from the real world in order to get measurable
effects. There are three conditions under which marijuana can be
shown to impair general psychological performance in laboratory
subjects. They are: (1) by giving it to people who have never had
it before; (2) by giving people very high doses that they are not
used to (or giving it orally to people used to smoking it); and
(3) by giving people very hard things to do, especially things
that they have never had a chance to practise while under the
influence of the drug. Under any of these three conditions,
pharmacologists can demonstrate that marijuana impairs
performance (p. 86).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It has been argued that most altered
states of consciousness, such as those produced in hypnosis,
meditation and ecstatic experiences, involve deployment of
attention in unique ways with a particular emphasis on the
present [29, 40, 41]. This 'unreflected', unselfconscious
attentional state, which is focused primarily in the 'now', will,
whether induced by drugs or not, interfere with the normal memory
processes associated with the 'reflected' conscious state which
is required for discursive thought and logico-temporal activities
usually associated with memory and task performance.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Thus, this paper would argue that any
discussion of motivation and THC use (and its relationship to
memory acquisition and performance) must consider the possibility
that THC facilitates a free-floating 'absorptive' state which
favours engagement in spatial-metaphoric cognitive styles of the
'unreflected' 'here and now' style of consciousness. This is
partly confirmed by the findings of Fabian and Fishkin who
observe in their study of cannabis and 'trait absorption' that<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">...marijuana users, when asked to
specifically reference the marijuana-high state, report a greater
number of absorbing experiences than when not specifically asked
to reference the marijuana state and when specifically asked to
exclude all drug-related experiences [42, p. 548].<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is thus possible that the apparent
memory deficits associated with 'amotivational syndrome' seen in
individuals intoxicated with THC and, who are being required to
perform and attend to verbal, temporal, logico-deductive
activities, are the result of 'time-sharing' between the two
states of 'reflected' and 'unreflected' consciousness. The effect
of this 'switching' is to disrupt the usual cognitive and memory
consolidation processes by constantly interrupting the continuity
of attention necessary for the completion of the memory process.
This 'time-sharing' can be conceptualised as a temporary and
rapid movement out of the cannabis-induced 'unreflected' state of
consciousness (absorptive state) into 'reflected' consciousness
when sufficient 'demand' is present calling the experient's
attention to the temporal, discursive information stream. As soon
as demand falls below some critical threshold required for
attention, the 'unreflected' state resumes thus disrupting any
on-going consolidation and learning process. The laying down of
short-term memory and the ability to attend accurately to
objective (clock) time require a certain level of continuous
background 'self-observation' and rehearsal - which is a central
part of 'reflected' state activity. Therefore, assigning the
cause of memory deficits measured in THC intoxicated individuals
to the direct pharmacological action of cannabis may be an
attribution error with cannabis being primarily a catalyst
(active placebo) for these altered states which are the actual
cause of the failure to process discursive information in the
usual way into long-term memory.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The self-rewarding quality of this
absorptive state will naturally lead to the cannabis user
preferentially returning to absorptive behaviours and cognitive
styles over and again. Of course, this will lead, no doubt, to a
loss of concentration on any performance task in process, thereby
creating a background of anxiety associated with the failure at
whatever chore the cannabis user is currently engaged. Naturally,
this will facilitate further and more frequent returns to the
absorptive state since it will be experienced as rewarding and
the demand of the performance activity as aversive. No doubt, in
time, the preference for the former state will lead to a
diminished capacity to perform in many areas of daily activity
which would likely cause considerable frustration in the
experient. This state of affairs will very likely lead, in time,
to the generation of a sense of learned helplessness which
undoubtedly will exacerbate any depressive reaction or existing
on-going depression.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Weil has argued that our natural
proclivity for altered states of consciousness traditionally has
been facilitated in many cultures by the ingestion of
psychoactive substances such as marijuana and hashish [15].
Although this drug 'high' was once accepted as one in a range of
possible states which humans might rightfully achieve, this is
certainly no longer the case in the West. Thus, the negative
reporting, vis-à-vis cannabis and performance, may now be
reconceptualized as a value judgement regarding the type of
mental state and hence style of cognitive performance deemed
useful and proper by today's social standards. Put more directly,
researchers are testing cannabis users on tasks which represent
current biases, thus allowing their research to reflect the
prejudices of their times. In other historical and cultural
contexts chemically and contemplatively induced altered states of
consciousness have been highly valued and it is arguable that
most religious traditions have drawn their deeper insights and
inspiration from these experiences.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The capacity of altered state
experiences to open broader existential perspectives and, hence,
new life meanings appears to be part of a growth process
intrinsic to both spiritual and creative life. Further, it can be
argued that these types of altered state experiences are
necessary in the facilitation of personal renewal and the relief
of psychological suffering. Although most of the major world
religious traditions have developed methods for achieving these
altered states without the use of pharmacological agents, in the
age of 'high-tech' medicine, and in the context of little social
or religious support for those 'talented' in the production of
altered state experiences, the adoption of chemical substances
and the attendant association with deviant social groups for
these ends should not be surprising.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The psychiatrist Arthur Deikman suggests
that the bifurcation of consciousness into 'observing' (objective
- 'reflected') and 'experiencing' (receptive - 'unreflected')
selves is common for most people living in the West today [43].
It is the denial of the latter mode, the source of our capacity
for mystical experience, which is the basis of our current
psycho-spiritual crisis and, arguably, the underlying
psychological cause of our destructive alienation from nature. He
asserts that without the cultivation of the 'experiencing self'
we may fail to enter into mystical awareness and therefore be
unable to remedy the psychopathology innate to our present
condition. Thus, from the position advocated by Deikman and from
the previous discussion, the use of cannabis in our modern
industrialized societies can be reconceptualized away from the
notion of a public health issue, to the understanding that its
use is deeply connected to the seeking of personal renewal or the
fulfilment of unmet spiritual needs, which users attempt to
fulfil, albeit inadequately, through ingesting the drug.</font> </p>
