<P>

When an area of high biodiversity and high endemism (number of species found nowhere else) overlaps an area threatened by habitat destruction, conservationists call that region a "hotspot."  Conservationist Norman Myers was the first to identify these most endangered ecosystems.  Although rain forest hotspots cover 0.64 percent of earth's land area,  scientists think they contain among 30 to 40 percent of the world's biological diversity.  But without dramatic changes, much of these habitats could be destroyed by the year 2000. 

<p>
The top ten hotspots on Myers' list encompass just 0.2 percent of the Earth's land surface and about 3.5 percent of the remaining primary rain forest, but contain more than a quarter and perhaps as much as a third of all plant species found in tropical forests, and thus at least 13 percent of all flowering plants on Earth.  

<P>
Hotspot areas are in red on the map, while tropical wilderness areas are green.

The key endangered hotspots include:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../regions/madagasc.htm">Madagascar</A>
<LI>the <A HREF="../regions/atlantic.htm">Atlantic forest</A> region of eastern Brazil
<LI>the lowland forest zone of western <A HREF="../regions/ecuador.htm">Ecuador</A>
<LI>the forested coastal plain of northern Colombia's Choc&oacute; region
<LI>the eastern slopes of the Andes bordering Amazonia in the countries of <A HREF="../regions/columbia.htm">Colombia</A>, Ecuador, <A HREF="../regions/peru.htm">Peru</A>, and <A HREF="../regions/bolivia.htm">Bolivia</A>
<LI>the <A HREF="../regions/philippi.htm">Philippine</A> archipelago
<li>the island of <A HREF="../regions/melanesi.htm">New Caledonia</A>
<li>the remnent forests of Peninsular Malaysia
<li>the remaining forests of northern Borneo in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak and the country of Brunei
<li>the island of <A HREF="../regions/melanesi.htm">New Guinea</A> (shared by the Papua New Guinea and Irain Jaya province of <A HREF="../regions/indonesi.htm">Indonesia</A>)
<li>the eastern Himalayan foothills
</UL>

<p>Many other areas, though not among this list of ten, have paramount regional significance as well.  They include:

<ul>
<li>the cloud forest and lowland rain forsets of southern <A HREF="../regions/mexico.htm">Mexico</A>, northern <A HREF="../regions/guatemal.htm">Guatemala</A>, and Belize
<li>the forest of the easten Arc mountains in Tanzania
<li>the upper Guinean forest in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa
<li>the Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka
<li>the tropical forests of Queensland
<li>the Hawaiian Islands
</ul>

<p>Such "second-tier hotspots" will not be neglected; they should be the centerpieces of national conservation programs and CI will be active in many of them as well.

<p>Much has changed since the original list of hotspots was first published.  CI is helping to produce an updated list for early 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>
