<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Brazil Under Pressure From
Investors And Local Exporters</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>SAO PAULO. (MP).- </strong>Strong
lobbying from Sao Paulo's exporters and equally strong demands
for a quicker opening of the Brazilian market from foreign
investors and bankers, have forced the government of Mercosur's main
member into a defensive situation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The recent municipal elections where there
was a clear advance of the opposition parties particularly in Sao Paulo,
Rio do Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre, the main
Brazilian cities, surprised President Henrique Cardoso who was
convinced his successful stabilisation economic program would
ensure a swift approval in Congress of his reelection plans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The fact is that the mayor of Sao Paulo
Pablo Maluf managed to retain control over the most important
city of Brazil turning him at the same time into a formidable
presidential candidate for 1998. Maluf has the support of local
industry and exporters, who are demanding a more flexible
exchange rate and tariff protection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The industrialists' demand has been
supported by recent statistics which indicate Brazil will have a
record trade deficit in 1996 which could increase next year. A
trade deficit which nevertheless has helped Mercosur trade
partners to overcome recession: 30% and 45% of Argentine and
Uruguayan exports are absorbed by the Brazilian market.</font></p>
