<h4>LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSITION COMPONENTS OF IEP</h4>
<p>
Transition services must be included in all IEPs when the student reaches age
16 and may be included for younger students if deemed appropriate by the IEP
team (<em>OSEP Letter to Anonymous</em>, 17 EFLR 842). Preventing school
drop-out is to be a major factor in determining when transition services are
needed (<em>OSEP Letter to Bereuter</em> 20 IDELR 536). Transition services
are a coordinated set of activities that promote movement from school to such
post-school activities as post-secondary education, vocational training,
employment, adult services, independent living and community participation.
They must be based on the individual student's needs, taking into account his
or her preferences and interests. Transition services must include
instruction, community experiences, and development of employment and other
post school adult living objectives. If appropriate, daily living skills and
functional vocational evaluation may also be included.
<p>
<A name="TRef"></a>If the IEP team determines an individual student does not need 
services in one or more of these areas the IEP must contain a statement to that effect 
and the basis upon which the determination is made (<em>OSEP Letter to Cernosia</em>.
19 IDELR 933). See Jim's <a href="#NonformT">Non-Form IEP transition component</a> for 
an example of such a statement regarding employment. Before the student leaves school 
the IEP must also contain, if appropriate, a statement of each public agency's and
each participating agency's responsibilities or linkages (including financial)
for the transition activities (34 CFR 300.346(d) and comment).
<p>
The IEP meeting must include a representative of the public agency providing
and supervising the transition activities and, if appropriate, representatives
of other participating agencies. In almost all situations the familiar
district representative required for all IEP meetings would qualify as this
representative. If appropriate, the student should also be there to ensure her
or his needs, preferences, and interests are addressed. It is difficult to
imagine circumstances where it would not be appropriate for a student who has
a learning disability to be at the meeting. If the student cannot attend,
other methods of participating must be used (34 CFR 300.344(c)(3)).
<p>
The ultimate responsibility for providing transition services rests with the
school district (or state education agency if district fails) and there is no
provision for a waiver of this requirement. Thus it applies to all public
agencies to whom IDEA applies and, if a participating agency defaults on
service provision, it is the school that must find an alternative way to
provide the service. However, nothing in IDEA relieves a participating agency
of any of its responsibility for serving or paying for services for that
student.
<p>
Two 1994 due process hearings against an Iowa district resulted in rulings
that the district's failure to provide appropriate transition planning and
services precluded the district from graduating the student and obligated it
to provide further vocational programs (<em>Mason City Comm. Sch. Dist</em>.
21 IDELR 241 and 21 IDELR 248).

<h4>DEVELOPING THE TRANSITION COMPONENT OF THE IEP</h4>
<p>
The transition component of the IEP is just that, a part of the student's
regular IEP. It is not a parallel document, a separate thing, or a "transition
IEP." All the IEP development requirements and procedures discussed earlier
also apply to the transition component. The legal significance of transition,
being but one aspect of the IEP process, is substantial. A student is entitled
to those transition services which for that student are either special
education or related services necessary to enable the student to benefit from
special education. The period of "benefit" to be considered has arguably been
lengthened beyond school and into adult life, but the substantive entitlement
is still to special education and related services, not to those plus
transition services.
<p>
One logical beginning point for the transition component is with the team
reaching agreement about the individual student's needs with regard to the
three mandated areas of: (a) instruction; (b) community experiences; and (c)
employment and other post-school living objectives. If the team deems it
inappropriate to address an area, presumably because the student presents no
unique needs, the IEP must include the basis for that determination. The
student's needs, taking into account interests and preferences, can be
explored prior to the meeting and substantial input should also be sought from
the parents. Questionnaires are appropriate.
<p>
Zigmond (1990) has studied extensively secondary programs for students with
learning disabilities and suggested four major areas of program need. First,
many of these students need, and too few receive, intensive basic skills
instruction. Too many programs slight basic skills altogether, believing it is
too late while others require students to "do" basic skills activities, but
provide next to no real instruction. What Zigmond calls "Survival Skills"
includes explicit instruction needed by most LD students in behavior control,
teacher-pleasing and study skills including test taking. The third need is for
successful completion of courses required for graduation. As schools suffer
funding cut backs, so-called basic level courses in math and English often
disappear, leaving IEP teams to struggle with issues of granting graduation
credit for resource room courses or for extensively modified regular courses.
One legally correct solution is for the district to establish what the
essential, minimum requirements are for credit toward graduation. Those may be
rigorously adhered to, as long as reasonable modifications are allowed in how
the requirement is met. The IEP should lay out these understandings clearly
and explicitly.
<p>
Transition needs are the last area Zigmond addresses. She points out that
about 12 to 30% of graduating LD students go on to college and they, of
course, have transition needs related to selecting and applying to a school.
She also notes that vocational education programs in high school are not
necessarily a better ticket to job success than are more academic programs. We
are left reaLizing, again, that many secondary programs still need improvement
and that we must truly look, in the IEP process, at the individual needs and
situation of each student.
<p>
One of the most important additional skills needed by many students who have
learning disabilities is self-advocacy. The student's presentation of his or
her needs at the IEP meeting may itself provide one opportunity to assess and
discuss self-advocacy skills. Another concern for some students with learning
disabilities is passing the examinations required to obtain a driver's
license. Using the same basic three-step inquiry process used in the rest of
the IEP and with self-advocacy and obtaining a driver's license as the
student's needs we can illustrate the inclusion of transition services on the
IEP. This Non-Form is nearly identical to that used earlier to show Joe's IEP.
The only difference is that the present level of performance is included in
the first rather than last column. That is just another way of doing it and is
unrelated to the fact we are illustrating transition.
<p>
It is important to note that the Secretary of Education has acknowledged that
not all the IEP content requirements, especially goals and objectives, are
appropriate for all transition services (FR 44847, discussion of 34 CFR
300.346). No IEP team should use time or energy trying to fit transition needs
and services into a format including annual goals and objectives unless it
truly makes sense to do so.

<h4>CONFIDENTIALITY OF IEPS</h4>
<p>
Many secondary teachers report they have no idea which of their students, if
any, are on IEPs and that they never see the IEP even when they are informed a
student has one. This is sad, perhaps sometimes even tragic. By its very
nature a good IEP is always helpful and sometimes essential in providing an
appropriate program for the student. Rarely is a student's disability so mild
or limited that she or he requires no modifications or accommodations in
regular middle school or high school classes.
<p>
When this process of hiding IEPs from teachers is questioned the common answer
suggests a belief that confidentiality would be violated if IEPs were shared.
While it is true IEPs are education records and must be treated as such, the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) has an exception which is
pertinent. Under Reg. 99.31(a) of the FERPA regulations, an educational agency
may disclose personally identifiable information from the education records of
a student without the written consent of the parent "if the disclosure is to
other school officials, including teachers, within the educational institution
or local education agency who have been determined by the agency or
institution to have legitimate educational interests" in that information.
<p>
Furthermore, even if there were a confidentiality problem under state law or
district policy it could be readily solved by parental permission to share the
IEP with all teachers. Parents should insist teachers have copies of the IEP,
even if it means they themselves must provide them to the teachers. Of course,
it should go without saying that the IEP should not contain any information
beyond what is required. It would not be appropriate, e.g., to include the
category of disability or an intelligence score, etc.

<h4>DISCUSSION</h4>
<p>
We are all new at incorporating transition services into the IEP and into the
broader world. Few rulings are yet available to assist us in understanding new
requirements. Already a few areas of confusion are emerging. Several are in
the direction of an unduly expansive reading of the new regulations.
<p>
First, the transition activities which must be addressed, unless the IEP team
finds it unnecessary, are: (a) instruction; (b) community experiences; and (c)
the development of objectives related to employment and other post-school
areas. There is a tendency to confuse these three requirements with the
post-school activities to which the three are to be directed, i.e.,
post-secondary education, vocational training, employment, adult services,
independent living, etc. Many "lists" are available which can be seen as
suggesting the IEP must address the latter directly rather than the former.
<p>
A second source of confusion is that by erroneously viewing the transition
component of the IEP as a thing unto itself it is easy to forget that IDEA
entitles the student who has a disability only to special education and
related services. The transition services to which a student is entitled must
fit the definition of one or the other. Therefore, each required transition
service must be either specially designed instruction to meet the students'
unique needs (taking into account his preferences and interests) or it must be
required to enable the student to benefit from that instruction. The fact that
transition services must qualify as either special education or related
services may not pose a significant limitation since one could argue that
almost any transition service is necessary to enable the student to reap the
benefits of all the special education she or he has had to date.
<p>
A third overly broad reading is the failure to recognize that "student's
preferences and interests" refers to determining the student's needs, not to
delineating the services to be provided (34 CFR 300.18(b)(1)(2)). One way to
approach the question of student needs is to envision a typical weekday and a
typical weekend after secondary school. Is the student still living in his or
her parents' home? Has she gotten an apartment? Does he know how to find
apartment ads in the classifieds? How to respond to an ad? How to locate the
address?
<p>
The exact process the IEP team goes through in looking into a student's
post-school future and planning for it will differ from student to student, as
it should. The essential elements which will not vary include student and
family participation and the willingness of the IEP team to address all the
areas of need-intensive and effective basic skills instruction (not just
exposure and not just repetitious practice), explicit survival
skills, graduation requirements, and transition.
<p>
Properly used, the IEP can be an extraordinarily useful tool in building the
future we desire for our students who have learning disabilities.
