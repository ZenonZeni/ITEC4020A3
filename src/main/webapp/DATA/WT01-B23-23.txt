<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Richard J. Bonnie* &amp; Charles H.
Whitebread, II**</i></font> </p>

<p><b>V. PASSAGE OF THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The first assertion of federal authority over marijuana use
was the Marihuana Tax Act, passed in 1937. The obvious question,
from a historical point of view, is why such legislation was
thought to be necessary, especially after the brushfire passage
of the Uniform Act and related legislation in every state in the
previous few years. Enforcement difficulty and public hysteria
are two reasons which have been propounded for the federal
action. We subscribe to a third, one which we rejected with
respect to the uniform acts-Congress was hoodwinked by the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. State Enforcement of the Uniform Law</b> </p>

<p>One of the primary arguments in support of the Marihuana Tax
Act was that the legislation was required to permit and
facilitate adequate enforcement of the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act.1 Initial examination of enforcement statistics after passage
of the Uniform Act suggests that marijuana seizures and arrests
in most states rose dramatically. </p>

<p>However, we should be careful to note at the outset the
inadequacies of most drug statistics, which, especially during
this period, do not permit conclusive analysis regarding the
extent of enforcement. </p>

<p>Reporting officials frequently do not differentiate among the
drugs. Different jurisdictions employ different measures of
enforcement-number of arrests, convictions, kilograms of the drug
seized, or number of seizures; even where the same measures are
used, statistics are often compiled for different time frames. In
addition, changes in the definitions in the laws-such as a change
from considering cannabis as only the flowering top of the plant
to considering it the whole plant-can wildly distort the
statistics from year to year. To add to the confusion,
enforcement agencies can manipulate the data for their own uses;
if they must appear to be attacking the drug problem or to need
more resources, they can change radically the statistical
appearance of the enforcement problem by using, for example,
arrests as their enforcement measure. Finally, the mere passage
of prohibitive legislation will in itself be reflected in the
enforcement data. This is especially important for our study of
enforcement patterns in the states before passage of the
Marihuana Tax Act. As one commentator has explained: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A point that should be obvious but that is sometimes
    overlooked is that there are no official statistics relating
    to violations of a drug, law until the drug law is enacted.
    To compare official preenactment and postenactment data is to
    compare nothing to something, and naturally drug use will
    appear to rise.2 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all these reasons, the drug statistics from the period of
the 1930's must be used somewhat hesitantly to support any
contention about the extent of state enforcement before the
enactment of Marihuana Tax Act. With this caveat in mind, we
shall proceed, nevertheless, to do so. </p>

<p>Although Commissioner Anslinger testified at the hearings on
the Tax Act that state officials frequently asked for federal
assistance 3 it appears from the Federal Bureau's own statistics
that state and municipal agencies were proceeding with vigor to
stamp out marijuana use.4 We do not have fully accurate data, but
there are indications that both New York and Louisiana were
moving against marijuana use. In 1934, the New York police
discovered a large field of marijuana growing near the Brooklyn
Bridge. In making a related raid, the police also seized 1,000
marijuana cigarettes.5 In 1935, the police burned a marijuana
crop found growing on the grounds of the Welfare Island
penitentiary.6 Throughout 1936, the narcotics division of the New
York police found and destroyed several marijuana crops growing
in and around the city.7 Fragmentary figures are available on law
enforcement in Louisiana which indicate there were 219 arrests on
marijuana charges in New Orleans alone from 1930 until April of
1936.8 In Louisiana as a whole for 1936 over 1,195 pounds of bulk
marijuana were seized.9 </p>

<p>This evidence suggests that state authorities in areas where
marijuana use had become common at all were dealing fairly
effectively with the trade in the drug. Although some states may
have hoped that passage of a federal law dealing with marijuana
would reduce the enforcement burden on state and local police and
bring additional federal services and money,10 the law cannot
really be justified as filling an enforcement void. Nevertheless,
this was one of the most effective arguments advanced by
Commissioner Anslinger in the halls of Congress. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. Public Hysteria or Continued Public Ignorance?</b> </p>

<p>Some observers have attributed passage of the Tax Act to
public hysteria.11 In support of this contention they show that
there was a marked increase in the number of titles dealing with
marijuana in the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature from
1936 until 1939, compared with the total absence of articles on
this subject in preceding years.12 It should be noted, however,
that only seven articles treating marijuana or hashish appeared
from 1920 to August 1937, when the Tax Act was passed.13 With
respect to medical opinion, the AMA Journal presented an article
opposing the enactment of the Tax Act and arguing, as did their
representative at the Tax Act hearings, 14 that existing state
laws were sufficient if properly enforced.15 </p>

<p>It seems the national media and medical opinion were far from
hysterical at the time the Tax Act passed. There were a few local
newspaper campaigns against the drug, but they tended to peak
about two years before the passage of the Act and were isolated
instances of public support for the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act.16
Moreover, these atypical state scares did not draw national
attention. </p>

<p>In fact, whatever publicity the &quot;marijuana problem&quot;
received during this period was attributable to Commissioner
Anslinger and his office, who conducted an active educational
campaign for federal legislation. They prepared press stories on
the dangers of the drug and traveled around the country
disseminating propaganda.17 Despite these efforts, however,
public knowledge of the marijuana proposals was minimal at best.
The New York Times contained nine references to marijuana from
January 1936 until it reported on August 3, 1937,18
&quot;President Roosevelt signed today a bill to curb traffic in
the narcotic, marihuana, through heavy taxes on
transactions.&quot; </p>

<p>As in prior years, marijuana was still not a matter of public
attention, and the so-called &quot;problem&quot; and the federal
proposal to cure it went virtually unnoticed by most of the
American public. At the same time, however, the
&quot;educational&quot; campaign conducted by the Bureau to
inform the Congress of the dimensions of the &quot;problem&quot;
was highly successful. In this sense, the Bureau itself created
the &quot;felt need&quot; for federal legislation; the Bureau-and
not public hysteria which it was unable to arouse-was the major
force behind the Tax Act. We assign to the Bureau the
instrumental role with respect to passage of the Tax Act even
though we did not do so with respect to the Uniform Act. So
successful were the Commissioner's efforts in the Congress that
the hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee and the
floor debate on the bill are near comic examples of dereliction
of legislative responsibility. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>C. The Tax Act Hearings</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Note from Cliff Schaffer:</b> Interested readers may refer
to the full text of the hearings for the <a
href="../../../hemp/taxact/taxact.htm">Marihuana Tax Act</a>, and
related documents, also on this site. </p>

<hr>

<p>Although the Marihuana Tax Act was modeled after the Harrison
Act, marijuana was not simply included in the earlier act
primarily for three reasons. First, the importation focus of the
Harrison Act was inappropriate for marijuana because there were
domestic producers.20 </p>

<p>Second, since cannabis had been removed from the United States
Pharmacopoeia and had no recognized medicinal uses, the variety
of medical exceptions in the Harrison Act were inapplicable.21
Third, even though the Supreme Court had upheld the Harrison
Act's prohibition against purchase by unregistered persons of the
designated drugs, there was some uncertainty whether the earlier
5-4 decision22 would be followed. Accordingly, the Marihuana Tax
Act imposed a prohibitive tax of $100 an ounce on the designated
transactions, rather than prohibit the purchases directly.23 </p>

<p>The brief three days of hearings on the Act24 present a case
study in legislative carelessness. At no time was any primary
empirical evidence presented about the effects of the drug, and
the participating congressmen seem never to have questioned the
assumed evils. Furthermore, the only real concerns seem to have
been that farmers would be inconvenienced by having to kill a
plant which grew wild in many parts of the country, and that the
birdseed, paint and varnish, and domestic hemp industries would
be damaged by passage of the law.25 Finally, the one witness
appearing in opposition to the bill, Dr. William C. Woodward,
legislative counsel of the American Medical Association and an
early and respected participant in the drafting of the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act,26 was roundly insulted for his audacity in
daring to question the wisdom of the Act. </p>

<p>We reproduce in the following few pages some of the dialogue
from the hearings, to give the reader the flavor of these
ramshackle proceedings, and to allow him to understand more fully
the pyramiding of absurdity represented by the amendments of the
1950's. From the hearings we extract contemporary perception of
use patterns and harmful effects of marijuana, the quality of
medical and other evidence presented, and a short glimpse at how
the witnesses were treated by the committee. </p>

<p><b>1. Who Were Users?</b> </p>

<p>The record of the hearings indicates quite clearly that the
Federal Narcotics Bureau was anxious for the committeemen to
believe marijuana use was a relatively new phenomenon that was on
the increase in America.27 Once again, marijuana use and the
Mexican minority were closely linked: &quot;The Mexican laborers
have brought seeds of this plant into Montana and it is fast
becoming a terrible menace, particularly in the counties where
sugarbeets are grown.&quot;28 Again, also, marijuana was
presented as the agent by which the underworld class hoped to
enslave American youth.29 The youth of the marijuana users was
contrasted with the increasing age of the usual opiate addict.
Perhaps most interestingly for later developments, Commissioner
Anslinger succinctly noted that heroin addicts and marijuana
users came from totally different classes and that the use of one
drug was unrelated to use of the other: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Anslinger.</b> This drug is not being used by those
    who have been using heroin and morphine. It is being used by
    a different class, by a much younger group of people. The age
    of the morphine and heroin addict is increasing all the time,
    whereas the marihuana smoker is quite young. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Dingell. </b>I am just wondering whether the
    marihuana addict graduates into a heroin, an opium or cocaine
    user. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Anslinger.</b> No sir; I have not heard of a case
    of that kind. I think it is an entirely different class. The
    marihuana addict does not go in that direction30 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hearings shed no more light on who was using the drug and
in what numbers. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. What's Wrong with Marijuana?</b> </p>

<p>If the proceedings did not shed light on the patterns of
usage, this in no way was an obstacle to unanimity on the evils
of the drug-insanity, criminality and death. Three major sources
were relied on to support this consensus (1) a variety of horror
stories from newspapers cited by Mr. Anslinger and others about
atrocious criminal acts committed by individuals under the
influence of the drug;31 (2) studies by Eugene Stanley, the
District Attorney of New Orleans, linking the drug and the
population of the Louisiana jails;32 and (3) some inconclusive
experimentation on dogs.33 As we noted earlier, the newspaper
stories about crimes committed under the influence of marijuana
have two things in common: The reports are unsubstantiated, and
many of the accused invoked their use of marijuana as a defense
to the charge .34 </p>

<p>The New Orleans report concluded: &quot;After an exhaustive
research on marijuana from its earliest history to the present
time, this drug is in our judgment the one that must be
eliminated entirely.&quot; 35 What was this exhaustive research?
It appears to have been nothing but quotations from the most
hysterical series of newspaper articles to appear at that time36
and reports of the number of marijuana addicts to be found in the
prison population.37 The relation of these figures to the
conclusion that the drug must be regulated was never established.
</p>

<p>The Stanley study38 was even less well documented and even
more outrageous in its description of the effects of marijuana
use. &quot;It is an ideal drug to quickly cut off
inhibitions.&quot; 39 For this proposition Stanley relied on the
story of the Persian &quot;Assassins&quot; who allegedly
committed acts of terror while under the influence of hashish.
Although Stanley included in his list of references the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission Report, it is clear he made little effort
to catalogue the then available data but contented himself with a
number of bold and undocumented assertions. In reading the
hearings, one continues to expect some report of a medical or
scientific survey, and instead one finds these two reports by New
Orleans law enforcers. The contrary conclusions of the Canal Zone
studies were not even mentioned. </p>

<p>Finally, a scientific study of the effects of marijuana was
presented, but, in keeping with the overall tone of the hearings,
this was the most preposterous evidence of all. The Treasury
Department presented a pharmacologist who had tested the effects
of the cannabis drugs on dogs. 40 He concluded that
&quot;[c]ontinuous use will tend to cause the degeneration of one
part of the brain.&quot; 41. </p>

<p>One paragraph later, however, this scientist stated:
&quot;Only about 1 dog in 300 is very sensitive to the
test.&quot;42 Later in the doctor's testimony, after he had
stated over and over the potential evils found from the testing
on dogs, he was unable to make the crucial link between a dog's
response to the drug and the human response. More incredibly, as
the following exchange points out, the doctor really had no
knowledge of what effect the drug had on the dogs, since he was
not familiar with the psychology of dogs: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. McCormack</b>. Have you experimented upon any
    animals whose reaction to this drug would be similar to that
    of human beings. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Munch.</b> The reason we use dogs is because the
    reaction of dogs to this drug, closely resembles the reaction
    of human beings. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. McCormack. </b>And the continued use of it, as you
    have observed the reaction on dogs, has resulted in the
    disintegration of the personality? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Munch.</b> Yes. So far as I can tell, not being a
    dog psychologist .... 43 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Woodward, the sole witness representing the American
Medical Association, noted the inadequacy of these medical
statistics. We include his statement on that point in full: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That there is a certain amount of narcotic addiction of an
    objectionable character no one will deny. The newspapers have
    called attention to it so prominently that there must be some
    grounds for their statements. It has surprised me, however,
    that the facts on which these statements have been based have
    not been brought before this committee by competent primary
    evidence. We arc referred to newspaper publications
    concerning the prevalence of marihuana addiction. We are told
    that the use of marihuana causes crime. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>But yet no one has been produced from the Bureau of
    Prisons to show the number of prisoners who have been found
    addicted to the marihuana habit. An informal inquiry shows
    that the Bureau of Prisons has no evidence on that point. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You have been told that school children are great users of
    marihuana cigarettes. No one has been summoned from the
    Children's Bureau to show the nature and extent of the habit,
    among children. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inquiry of the Children's Bureau shows that they have had
    no occasion to investigate it and know nothing particularly
    of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inquiry of the Office of Education-and they certainly
    should know something of the prevalence of the habit among
    the school children of the country, if there is a prevalent
    habit-indicates that they have had no occasion to investigate
    and know nothing of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, there is in the Treasury Department itself, the
    Public Health Service, with its Division of Mental Hygiene.
    The Division of Mental Hygiene was, in the first place, the
    Division of Narcotics. It was converted into the Division of
    Mental Hygiene, I think, about 1930. That particular Bureau
    has control at the present time of the narcotics farms that
    were created about 1929 or 1930 and came into operation a few
    years later. No one his been summoned from that Bureau to
    give evidence on that point. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Informal inquiry by me indicates that they have had no
    record of any marihuana or Cannabis addicts who have even
    been committed to those farms. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Bureau of the Public Health Service has also a
    division of pharmacology. If you desire evidence as to the
    pharmacology, of Cannabis, that obviously is the place where
    you can get direct and primary evidence, rather than the
    indirect hearsay evidence. 44 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Woodward's testimony clearly manifests the deficiencies of
the hearings, for at no time did the congressional committee hear
primary sources of competent medical evidence before labeling
cannabis the producer of crime and insanity. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. How Dare You Dissent!</b> </p>

<p>Following the testimony of the Treasury Department and its
witnesses, the only witnesses who came forward were
representatives of legitimate industries that feared the Tax Act
would damage their businesses, because manufacture of their
products required some part or parts of the cannabis plant.45
These witnesses were assured that the Tax Act would have little
if any impact on their operations .46 </p>

<p>The one witness who opposed the adoption of the Act was
roundly accused of obstructionism and bad faith. Dr. Woodward,
one of the chief drafters of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act,
appeared on behalf of the AMA to suggest that, if there was to be
any regulation of the cannabis drugs at all, it should be added
to the Harrison Act and not be the subject of this separate, and
he felt inadequately considered, legislative proposal.47 We have
already examined Dr. Woodward's skepticism on the dangers of the
drug. He added to this a thinly veiled attack on the lack of
cooperation the AMA had received from the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics.48 Finally, he advocated either assisting state
enforcement of their existing laws dealing with the drug or at
most including marijuana as a regulated and taxed drug under the
Harrison Act. </p>

<p>Either because of antipathy to the AMA or because of the
audacity of these suggestions, the Committee members savagely
attacked both Dr. Woodward and the AMA. Witness the following
exchange, starting with the doctor's answer to questions why, he
had not proposed marijuana legislation </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward. </b>In the first place, it is not a
    medical addiction that is involved and the data do not come
    before the medical society. You may absolutely forbid the use
    of Cannabis by any physician, or the disposition of Cannabis
    by any pharmacist in the country, and you would not have
    touched your Cannabis addiction as it stands today, because
    there is no relation between it and the practice of medicine
    or pharmacy. It is entirely outside of the those two
    branches. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>The Chairman.</b> If the statement that you have made
    has any relation to the question that I asked, I just do not
    have the mind to understand it; I am sorry. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward.</b> I say that we do not ordinarily come
    directly to Congress if a department can take care of the
    matter. I have talked with the Commissioner, with
    Commissioner Anslinger. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>The Chairman. </b>If you want to advise us on
    legislation, you ought to come here with some constructive
    proposals, rather than criticism, rather than trying to throw
    obstacles in the way of something that the Federal Government
    is trying to do. It has not only an unselfish motive in this,
    but the), have a serious responsibility. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward. </b>We cannot understand yet, Mr.
    Chairman, why this bill should have been prepared in secret
    for 2 years without any intimation, even, to the profession,
    that it was being prepared .49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After accusing Dr. Woodward of obstruction, evasion and bad
faith, the Committee did not even thank him for his testimony.50 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>D. Congressional &quot;Deliberation&quot; and Action</b> </p>

<p>We noted earlier that the marijuana &quot;problem&quot; and
the proposed federal cure were virtually unnoticed by the general
public. Unable to arouse public opinion through its educational
campaign, the Bureau of Narcotics nevertheless pushed the
proposed legislation through congressional committees. The
Committee members were convinced by meaningless evidence that
federal action was urgently needed to suppress a problem that was
no greater and probably less severe than it had been in the
preceding six years when every state had passed legislation to
suppress it. The Committee was also convinced, incorrectly, that
the public was aware of the evil and demanded federal action. </p>

<p>The debate on the floor of Congress shows both the low public
visibility of the legislation and the nonchalance of the
legislators. The bill passed the House of Representatives in the
very late afternoon of a long session; many of the members were
acquainted neither with marijuana nor with the purpose of the
Act. When the bill first came to the House floor late on June 10,
1937, one congressman objected to considering the bill at such a
late hour, whereupon the following colloquy occurred: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. DOUGHTON. </b>I ask unanimous consent for the
    present consideration of the bill (H.R. 6906) to impose an
    occupational excise tax upon certain dealers in marihuana, to
    impose a transfer tax upon certain dealings in marihuana, and
    to safeguard the revenue therefrom by registry and recording.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Clerk read the title of the bill. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL.</b> Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to
    object, and notwithstanding the fact that my friend, Reed, is
    in favor of it, is this a matter we should bring up at this
    late hour of the afternoon? I do not know anything about the
    bill. It may be all right and it may be that everyone is for
    it, but as a general principle, I am against bringing up any
    important legislation, and I suppose this is important, since
    it comes from the Ways and Means Committee, at this late hour
    of the day.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. RAYBURN.</b> Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will
    yield, I may say that the gentleman from North Carolina has
    stated to me that this bill has a unanimous report from the
    committee and that there is no controversy about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL. </b>What is the bill? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. RAYBURN</b>. It has something to do with something
    that is called marihuana. I believe it is a narcotic of some
    kind. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. FRED M. VINSON. </b>Marihuana is the same as
    hashish. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL.</b> Mr. Speaker, I am not going to object
    but I think, it is wrong to consider legislation of this
    character at this time of night.51 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On June 14 when the bill finally emerged on the House floor,
four representatives in one way or another asked that the
proponents explain the provisions of the Act. Instead of a
detailed analysis, they received a statement of one of the
members of the Ways and Means Committee repeating uncritically
the lurid criminal acts Anslinger had attributed to marijuana
users at the hearings. After less than two pages of debate. the
Act passed without a roll call.52 When the bill returned as
amended from the Senate, the House considered it once again, and
adopted as quickly as possible the Senate suggestions, which were
all minor.53 The only question was whether the AMA agreed with
the bill. Mr. Fred Vinson not only said they did not object when
in fact their committee witness had dissented strenuously, but he
also claimed that the bill had AMA support. After turning Dr.
Woodward's testimony on its head, he also called him by another
name, Wharton.54 </p>

<p>In summary, the Act passed the Congress with little debate and
even less public attention. Provoked almost entirely by the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and by a few hysterical state law
enforcement agents hoping to get federal support for their
activities, the law was tied neither to scientific study nor to
enforcement need. The Marihuana Tax Act was hastily drawn, heard,
debated and passed; it was the paradigm of the uncontroversial
law. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>E. Provisions of the Act</b> </p>

<p>Except for the three differences noted above, the Marihuana
Tax Act is modeled directly after the earlier federal tax act
regulating the opiates -the Harrison Act. As with that Act, the
enforcement of the new marijuana tax was left to the Bureau of
Narcotics in the Treasury Department. Thus, as a result of the
1937 statute, the jurisdiction of the Bureau was increased
substantially.55 </p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act deals specifically with the seeds, resin
and most other parts and derivatives of the plant Cannabis Sativa
L. The Act requires persons importing, producing,56 selling or in
any other way dealing with the drug to pay an occupational tax
and to register with the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
all transferees of marijuana are required to file a written order
form and to pay a transfer tax, $1 per ounce if registered and a
prohibitive $100 per ounce if not registered . 57 Possession of
the drug without a written order form constitutes presumptive
evidence of noncompliance with the Act. It is also unlawful for a
transferor to transfer the drug to a person who has not secured
the order form and paid the tax. As originally enacted, section
12 of the Act assessed a fine of not more than $2,000 and/or
imprisonment for not more than five years for violation of each
provision of the Act.<br>
</p>

<h2>Footnotes and References </h2>

<p>1 The best example of this argument is contained in
Commissioner Anslinger's statement to the congressional committee
hearings on the Marihuana Tax Act: </p>

<p align="center"><b>STATE LAWS</b> </p>

<p>All of the States now have some type of legislation directed
against the traffic in marijuana for improper purposes. There is
no legislation in effect with respect to the District of Columbia
dealing with marijuana traffic. There is unfortunately a loophole
in much of this State legislation because of a too narrow
definition of this term. Few of the States have a special
narcotic law enforcement agency and, speaking generally,
considerable training of the regular peace officers will be
required together with increased enforcement facilities before a
reasonable measure of effectiveness under the State laws can be
achieved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>NEED FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION</b> </p>

<p>Even in States which have legislation controlling in some
degree the marijuana traffic, public officials, private citizens,
and the press have urged or suggested the need for national
legislation dealing with this important problem. A partial list
of States wherein officials or the press have urged the need for
Federal legislation on the subject are Colorado, Kansas, New
Mexico, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. </p>

<p>The uniform State narcotic law has now been adopted by some 35
States, many of these including cannabis or marijuana within the
scope of control by that law. However, it has recently been
learned that the legislative definition of cannabis in most of
these laws is too narrow, and it will be necessary to have the
definition amplified in amendatory legislation in most of the
States, to accord with the definition in the pending Federal
bill. As is the case at present with respect to opium, coca
leaves, and their respective alkaloids, the uniform State law
does not completely solve the enforcement problem with respect to
marijuana but it will provide the necessary supplement to the
Federal act and permit cooperation of State and Federal forces,
each acting within its respective sphere, toward suppression of
traffic for abusive use, no matter in what form the traffic is
conducted. The Bureau of Narcotics, under the Marijuana Taxing
Act, would continue to act as an informal coordinating agency in
the enforcement of the Uniform State law, exchanging information
as between the respective State authorities in the methods of
procedure and attempting to secure true uniformity in the
enforcement of the act in the various States which have adopted
it. </p>

OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS 63 (1935) [hereinafter cited as TRAFFIC IN
Opium]; id. at 90 (1936); id. at 81 (1937); Part of the erratic
quality of these figures may stem from failure to weigh only the
dried flowering tops of the plants seized. For example, 256
pounds seized in 1937 may represent a larger quantity of total
plants than 391,787 pounds seized in 1935. See Mandel, supra note

article reported a meeting between Anslinger and the chairwoman
of the New York Federation of Women's Clubs. After the meeting,
the chairwoman started an all out campaign against marijuana,
focusing on lobbying for the nationwide passage of state
legislation, and on an educational program aimed at educating
high school students on the dangers of the drug, Another New York
Times article described the appearance of a representative of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics at a meeting of the national Parents
and Teachers Association held in Richmond, Virginia, urging the
members of the association to help fight the menace of marijuana
which produced in its users &quot;a temporary sense of complete
irresponsibility which led to sex crimes and other 'horrible'
acts of violence.&quot; N.Y. Times, May 4, 1937, at 26, col. 1. </p>

<p>20 Compare Tax Act Hearings 13-14 (testimony of Clinton
Hester, Office of the General Counsel of the Treasury Department)
with State v. Bonoa, 172 La. 955, 136 So. 15 (1931). It should be
asked whether the information at congressional disposal changed
so drastically between 1937 and 1956 as to justify the statutory
presumption enacted at that time, 21 U.S.C. 5 176a (1964),
providing that possession of marijuana was presumptive evidence
of knowing concealment of illegally imported marijuana. </p>

<p>21 Tax Act Hearings 13-14. Earlier state statutes,
particularly Virginia's, had taken great pains to outline medical
exemptions from the marijuana prohibition. See p. 1040 supra. </p>

<p>22 United States v. Doremus, 249 U.S. 86 (1919). </p>

<p>23 Tax Act Hearings 13-14. </p>

<p>24 The hearings, including all material not actively discussed
but merely read into the record, cover only 124 pages. </p>

<p>25 Tax Act Hearings 77-86; see State v. Bonoa, 172 La. 955,
136 So. 15 (1931). </p>

<p>27 See Tax Act Hearings 30-3 1. </p>

<p>28 Id. at 45. </p>

<p>29 Quoting Dr. Walter Bromberg, Mr. Anslinger stated: </p>

<p>Young men between the ages of 16 and 25 are frequent smokers
of marihuana; even boys of 10 to 14 are initiated (frequently in
school groups); to them as to others, marihuana holds out the
thrill. Since the economic depression the number of marihuana
smokers was increased by vagrant youths coming into intimate
contact with older psychopaths. </p>

<p>Tax Act Hearings 24. See also id. at 32-35, 39, 45. </p>

<p>30 Id. at 24. </p>

<p>31 Id. at 22-23. </p>

<p>32 Id. at 32-37. </p>

<p>33 Id. at 50-52. </p>

<p>34 See id. at 22-23. It is entirely likely that some of these
particularly lurid stores were the product of desperate
defendants, who, upon being caught red-handed in the commission
of crime, sought mitigation of their penalties by claiming to be
under the influence of the drug. See Bromberg, Marijuana: A
Psychiatric Study, 113 J.A.M.A. 4 (1939). Bromberg cautions,
&quot;The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press
that crime is caused by addiction to marihuana demands [sic]
careful scrutiny, at least in this jurisdiction [New York
County).&quot; Id. at 10. </p>

<p>35 Tax Act Hearings 35. </p>

<p>36 A good example is the series run by the St, Louis
Star-Times in early 1935 which featured such articles as the one
entitled &quot;Young Slaves to Dope Cigaret Pay Tragic Price for
Their Folly&quot; on Jan. 18, 1935. </p>

<p>37 See Gomila &amp; Gomila, Marihuana-A More Alarming Menace
to Society Than All Other Habit-Forming Drugs, quoted in Tax Act
Hearings 32, 34. Mr. F. R. Gomila was public safety director of
New Orleans. </p>

<p>38 Stanley, Marihuana as a Developer of Criminals, 2 Am. J.
Police Sci. 252 (1931), quoted in Tax Act Hearings 37-42, is
based on, and indeed is nearly a word-for-word paraphrase of,
Fossier's article in the New Orleans Medical journal, supra note
91 at P. 1044. As we have seen, Fossier, in reaching his
conclusions, overlooked the Panama Canal Zone study. </p>

<p>39 Tax Act Hearings 39. </p>

<p>40 0ne assumes the drug was thought to be too dangerous to
risk experimentation on people. </p>

<p>45 Thus, the following witnesses appeared: Hon. Ralph E.
Lozier, General Counsel of the National Institute of Oilseed
Products; Raymond G. Scarlett of the birdseed industry; and
Joseph B. Hertzfeld, Manager, Feed Department, The Philadelphia
Seed Co. </p>

<p>46 See id. at 74. </p>

<p>47 Id. at 87-121. </p>

<p>48 Id. at 87-88 (&quot;During the past 2 years I have visited
the Bureau of Narcotics probably 10 or more times. Unfortunately,
I had no knowledge that such a bill as this was proposed until
after it had been introduced&quot;). </p>

<p>49 Id. at 116. </p>

<p>50 See id. at 121. There is sonic indication in Fred Vinson's
questioning of Dr. Woodward that one cause of the hostility
directed at the witness was the growing disfavor with which the
New Deal Congress viewed the fairly conservative AMA. Vinson was
particularly pointed when he said that the AMA was trying to
obstruct here as it had with the Health Care provisions of the
Social Security Act, Id. it 102-04. </p>

<p>51 81 CONG. REC. 5575 (1937). </p>

<p>54 Id. at 7625. </p>

<p>55 See Dickson, Bureaucracy and Morality: An Organizational
Perspective an a Moral Crusade, 16 SOCIAL PROD. 143 (1968)
(relating this expansion of the Bureau's area of enforcement to
their solid support for the need of such federal legislation). </p>

<p>56 Section 4 (b) of the Act (now INT. REV. CODE Of 1954, §
4755 (a) (2) ) gives rise to a presumption that one is a producer
of marijuana within the terms of the Act if marijuana is found
growing on his property. </p>

<p>57 The Act does not prohibit possession or purchase of
marijuana per se.<br>
