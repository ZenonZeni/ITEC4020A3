<h2 align=center>Parenting The Child With<BR>
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</h2>

<p>Children with AD/HD present a problem to their parents. Because they
are energetic, loving; at times impossible and excitable, many parenting
techniques simply do not work. Effective parenting involves patience, time,
effort, and inter-parental cooperation. The following represent some concrete
ideas and suggestions:

<UL>
<LI><b>Be Positive</b> - It is easy to notice the negative behavior of
a child with AD/HD because there is so much of it. Noticing and reinforcing
positive behavior is critical. There is a tendency to leave the child alone
when she or he is being &quot;good.&quot; To the contrary, this is the
time to say or do something that will make the positive behavior more 
probable.
<br></LI>

<LI><b>Use Praise</b> - Learning a variety of ways to say &quot;good 
job&quot; and &quot;thanks&quot; can do wonders for the child with AD/HD.
This is a major means that you can use to reinforce positive behavior.
<br></LI>

<LI><b>Be Specific, Concrete and Immediate</b> - Children with AD/HD
do not do well with generalities or with feedback that is delayed. Their 
rapid pace, hyperactivity, and distractibility make swift parental 
response critical.
<BR>
<DL>
<DD><b>Break things into manageable elements.</b> For example, when giving
tasks, be specific and to the point. Telling a child with this disorder
to clean his or her room is fruitless. On the other hand telling them to
pick up dirty clothes and put them in the hamper or pick up all of the
GI Joes and put them in a box will bring good results.
<BR>
<DD><b>Do not use complex, long-winded verbal communication.</b> Children
with AD/HD do not tolerate complexity and may hear a portion of what is
being said. They may only hear the first command of a series. Often, they
may need to have things repeated or be asked to say what they have heard
in order to accomplish a task.
<BR>
<DD><b>Reinforce or punish now, not later</b>. Because of memory problems
and a tendency to operate in the here and now and not in the future, parental
responses need to be immediate.<br></dd>
</DL>

<LI><b>Discipline Must be Positive, If Possible, and Not Negative</b> -
Children with AD/HD often do much better by hearing positive rather than
getting into a vicious negative feedback cycle, negative behavior escalating
parental negatives. Some concrete techniques to facilitate this are:
<BR>
<DL>
<dd><b>Give choices and options.</b> Children with AD/HD often create power
struggles and do not do well in confrontations, &quot;options&quot; are
more useful than &quot;musts.&quot; For example, &quot;Do you want to do
your homework now or in 30 minutes?&quot; 
<br>

<dd><b>Use charts</b>. Things written down in specifics will be useful
because they are visual and concrete. They can be helpful to remind children
what they have to do and when.
<br>

<dd><b>Use reward systems</b>. Children with AD/HD are more ruled by immediate
gratification than by mature deliberation or by long term consequences.
Using rewards for behavior with concrete payoff can be incredibly useful.
<br>

</DL>

<li><b>Structure is Important As Is Attention to Time and Sequence</b>
- Children with AD/HD do not do well with unpredictability, change and
a lack of consistency. Specific times for homework for completing tasks,
chores, and other requirements are useful. If charts are used, they can
dictate components of tasks in a sequential fashion. 
<br></li>

<li><b>Parents on the Same Wavelength and in Agreement</b> - To have a
parent coalition that is imbalanced and not working well together (blaming
and condemning) will wreak havoc. Part of therapy is to heal parental splits
and to come to agreement. 
<br></li>

<li><b>Parents Must Take Time to Nurture Each Other and Take Time Out</b>
- Due to the stress of raising a child who is hyperactive and distractible,
parents must take time away and not be locked into their child's world.
Going out and/or taking long weekends together can be very fruitful. </li>
</ul>
