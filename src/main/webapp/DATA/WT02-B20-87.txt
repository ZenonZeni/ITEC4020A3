  This book illustrates techniques that families have found effective in coping 
with a family member who has mental retardation.  It provides quotations and 
comments from a number of parents as well as anecdotal accounts and 
photographs, grouped into four sections.  The first section is on the 
recognition process and recounts how parents have coped with the emotional 
trauma and imbalance as their feelings change from joy to sorrow and 
uncertainty when finding out and acknowledging that their child has mental 
retardation.  The second section is on the dynamic process of dealing with 
fears, fantasies, and facts associated with the effects of the disability on 
the family dynamics.  The third section stresses the working process which is 
using existing support systems and the exercising of rights when dealing with 
schools, programs, and placement decisions.  The final section is on the future 
process--ways to prepare and position the family member with mental retardation 
for a lifetime.  (DB)<BR>

  Inclusion of students with disabilities, especially those with mental 
retardation, has come to mean the placement of all students in general 
education classrooms, sometimes with limited planning for the individual needs 
of each student.  Several court cases, laws, and movements have brought about 
the level of inclusion that exists today.  However, schools are now evolving 
from inclusion to integration, which involves the planned placement of students 
in a setting.  Two circuit court cases with implications for integration 
include Holland versus the Board of Sacramento City Unified School District, in 
which four components were outlined for determining the removal of a student 
from general education and the Oberti case, which stated that students with 
disabilities should be placed in general education classes with appropriate 
support.  The four components of the Holland case provide a framework for 
examining what is effective in integrating students; components include 
educational benefits, non-academic benefits, effect on teacher and children in the
regular classroom, and cost.  A case-by-case approach to integrating students into
general education is needed.  The established best practices of the field of mental
retardation should follow students no matter where they are placed, and ongoing
monitoring of student progress should occur.  (Contains 45 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This revised digest presents basic information on mental retardation for 
educators and others.  First, definitions from the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the American Association on Mental 
Retardation (AAMR) are presented.  The fact sheet then analyzes how the new 
AAMR definition differs from earlier ones noting the new definition's emphasis 
on a pattern of limitations and on a multidimensional approach to assessment.  The
AAMR use of the term "supports," is also explained noting the eight types of 
function that support can serve and four levels of support intensity.  Also 
cited are figures showing the number of children, aged 6-21, who were 
classified as having mental retardation and received services under IDEA.  Additional
paragraphs list typical characteristics of children with mental 
retardation and consider educational implications (such as use of more hands-on 
instructional materials with these children and short but frequent learning 
sessions).  The fact sheet also lists 10 suggested additional readings, 9 
organizational resources, and 3 periodicals.  (DB)<BR>

  Seventy-seven children (ages 5-13) with mild to moderate mental retardation 
were presented with addition problems.  The patterns of strategies used were 
found to be similar to those used by intellectually normal children, though 
counting-on and memory strategies were used by subjects with greater frequency. 
Strategies became more sophisticated with subjects' age.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This paper presents a summary of a qualitative research study which 
evaluated, in case studies of three families, what it means to have a child 
with a disability.  The research developed out of practice in early 
intervention and work focusing on optimal developmental environments for 
persons with disabilities.  Background information on each of the families is 
provided, including data on the children's disabilities, which included mental 
retardation in each case.  Five principal areas which emerged from interview 
data are identified: the children, parental stress/anxiety, services, personal 
comments, and survival strategies.  Data acquired from questionnaires completed 
by the parents and from the MAPS (McGill Action Planning System) planning 
process are also presented.  Recommendations are provided in three areas: 
attitude changes, policy changes, and service provision.  (Contains 14 
references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This paper examines issues concerning self determination for people with 
mental retardation and other disabilities, within the context of the Life 
Centered Career Education (LCCE) curriculum.  It looks at various views of self-
determination; offers a definition; and relates self-determination to autonomy, 
self-actualization, and self-regulation.  Aspects of the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act dealing with self-determination and transition are 
considered, as are best practices in promoting self-determination and the 
educator's role in this process.  The paper then addresses the curricular 
components of self-determination, describing the development of one 
organization's (The Arc) model of self-determination and a project which 
resuinstruction.  (Contains 26 references.) (DB)<BR>

sibling who does not have a disability?"; "What are some of the concerns of 
siblings of people with disabilities?"; "Are there any benefits to being the 
brother or sister of a person with a disability?"; "What are some positive 
actions parents can take with their children when there is a sibling with a 
disability?"; "How does family structure affect siblings?"; and "What is being 
done to address concerns that siblings may have about having a brother or 
sister with a disability?" Also provided is a list of three organizational

  This monograph addresses the issue of full inclusion of children and youth 
with severe intellectual disabilities and whether this form of social and 
academic integration is consistent with the direction of present school reform 
policies.  The first section examines the implications of current efforts in 
educational reform.  A case study illustrates differences between integration 
and inclusion.  Key elements of full inclusion are identified: (1) full general 
education class membership; (2) full perception of "ownership" by the general 
education program (including special education); (3) individual outcomes-based 
decision making; (4) student-based services with team curriculum design; and 
(5) site team coordination of services and educational support.  Next, issues 
in education policy are discussed such as recent trends in general education 
policy and reform.  The following critical variables in school restructuring 
are identified: curriculum revision, performance-based assessment, 
decentralized instruction, school autonomy, site-based management and 
budgeting, shared decision making, infusion and coordination of educational 
resources, and community involvement.  Finally, the comprehensive local school 
is described as a framework for inclusion through delivery of a variety of 
special education services and through systematic team design of the 
individual's curriculum within the general curriculum.  (Contains 87 
references.) (DB)<BR>

  This paper describes a language-based, problem-solving socialization and sex 
education curriculum designed for individuals with developmental delays.  The 
curriculum aims to increase the students' understanding of themselves socially, 
psychologically, and physically enabled to function more effectively in a 
mainstream society that is ever changing.  The program has a strong theoretical 
and applied research base in the areas of language development and thought, 
sociolinguistics, and cognitive behavior modification.  It uses a process-
oriented approach involving group interaction and natural context.  This paper 
describes the program's philosophy, parental permission needed, student 
attitudes, and use of team teaching.  Activities include vocabulary 
development; use of pictures, slides, and videotapes; semantic mapping; role 
play; problem solving; group work; and follow-up activities.  The curriculum's 
31 lessons cover such topics as hygiene, human reproduction, relationships, 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and sexual abuse.  A sample lesson plan is 
presented, on the topic of parts of the body.  (Contains 32 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This monograph presents a rationale for proactive social skills training for 
persons with mental retardation as well as over 100 examples of such 
instruction across the K-12 continuum.  Chapter 1 provides a conceptual 
framework of social competence with principles of what, when, and how to teach 
social skills.  Chapter 2 discusses the direct instruction of social skills 
including use of simulation and specific instructional procedures and processes.
The bulk of the book consists of specific lesson plans organized by level 
(primary, intermediate, middle school/junior high, and senior high) and skill 
areas (classroom related skills, school building related skills, personal 
skills, interaction initiative skills, interaction response skills, community 
related skills, and work related skills).  Each lesson plan includes the 
objective, performance criteria, materials needed, and procedures (often 
outlined in detail).  A checklist for rating school and community social skills 
is appended as are homework forms to encourage practice in 32 specific skills.
