<H3>The Nuclear Safety Account: Achievements and Projects After One Year of
Activity. Francois Demarcq.</H3>
<P> 


The Nuclear Safety Account (NSA) was established in 1993 by request of the G-7
countries, to address immediate operational safety and technical safety
improvement measures for Soviet-designed reactors in central and eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union. The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) acts as the NSA Secretariat and provides technical, financial,
legal and administrative services. Funding is by voluntary contribution from EBRD
members and other countries, and so far totals ECU 135 million (US$165 million).
Priority is given to reactors presenting the highest level of risk, that can be
significantly reduced by short-term and cost-effective safety measures, and which
are necessary to ensure a region's continuing electricity supply.<P>

Under the Soviet system, nuclear plant operation was geared towards achieving
maximum output; safety considerations came second. The design deficiencies of
VVER and RBMK reactors are listed. Promotion of a 'safety culture' is advocated,
and desired improvements detailed, both operational (training of plant personnel,
good maintenance procedures, fire protection measures, pressure boundary
inspection and component testing, quality assurance programmes) and technical
(fire detection and fighting equipment, emergency diesel generators, emergency core
cooling system improvements, new reactor trip automatic systems, control room
aids, segregation of safety-related equipment). Experts estimate costs of short-term
safety improvements to RBMKs and VVERs at US$700 million to US$1 billion.<P>

The NSA's project at the Kozloduy VVER-440/230s plant in Bulgaria, cost ECU 24
million (US$30 million), is currently being implemented, and the ECU 33 million
(US$40 million) for Lithuania's Ignalina plant with 2 RBMKs, has been approved.
Two further projects, for the Leningrad plant's four RBMKs (ECU 30 million
(US$36 million)) and the Novovoronezh and Kola plants with four VVER-440/230
reactors (ECU 45 million (US$55 million)) are being negotiated. Further
developments in Russia are expected and also in the Ukraine, where the focus is on
a quick shutdown of Chernobyl in the context of a comprehensive energy
strategy,including completion of three VVER-1000s.<P>

The EBRD's energy operations policy has recently been updated, spelling out more
explicitly the principles underlying its nuclear safety activities.<P>

A loan is being considered for completion and safety upgrading of two VVER-
440/213 units at Mochovce in Slovakia. Further projects however appear doubtful,
especially in the Ukraine due to its particular economic difficulties.<P>

The Russian nuclear establishment tends to interpret the western attitude as
antagonistic to the Russian nuclear system. This attitude must somehow be
overcome if nuclear safety risks are to be reduced and longterm cooperation and in-
depth exchange of knowledge and expertise is to be instituted. The EBRD hopes to
help establish this mutual confidence.<P>
