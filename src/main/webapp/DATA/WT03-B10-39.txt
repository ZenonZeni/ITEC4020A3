FOUR CANDIDATES SIGN ON AS PBS GEARS UP FOR NATIONAL ISSUES
CONVENTION

     While PBS is gearing up with publicity and other fanfare for
start of National Issues Convention (NIC) Jan. 18-21 at U. of
Tex.-Austin, only 4 presidential candidates have accepted
invitations to appear to answer questions from NIC participants,
and 2 of them will take part via satellite.  More importantly,
staffers for key Republican candidate Sen. Dole (R-Kan.) have told
press that he won't be attending.  President Clinton, whose
scheduled revolves around completion of budget talks, hasn't made
up his mind whether to attend, and his appearance live or by
satellite likely depends on budget negotiations scheduled to
reconvene Jan. 17.

     Spokeswoman for NIC said Republican hopefuls Lamar Alexander,
Richard Lugar, Steve Forbes and Sen. Gramm (R-Tex.) all have agreed
to answer questions live before group of representatives from
across U.S. who will spend days prior taking part in deliberative
poll -- discussing and studying issues before going to candidates
with their concerns.  Alexander and Gramm will take part via
satellite, spokeswoman said.  She said Sen. Dole hasn't told NIC
that he won't attend and planners still are hopeful they can find
way for him to participate.  NIC planners said discussions also
continue with White House on securing Democratic presence at event. 
James Fishkin, chmn. of govt. dept. at U. of Tex. and NIC exec.
dir., said organizers hope "that all of the candidates  -- both
Democrat and Republican -- will realize the importance of this
opportunity."  He called poll "democracy at work," putting "entire
country in one room for an open dialogue on the subjects that
matter to many of us."

     Staffers at MacNeil-Lehrer Productions, which is producing
convention for air on PBS, have invited other "policymakers" and
"opinion makers" in case Clinton, Dole and others can't attend,
spokeswoman said.  Names of those invited weren't disclosed.  She
said even if originally-planned cast of candidates don't all show
up, NIC participants -- all 600 -- still will get to take part in
nation's first major deliberative poll, which will show what
citizens think about issues as they become more informed about them
through discussions in small groups as well as with candidates and
other opinion shapers.

     Citizen participants, making up representative sample of U.S.,
are scheduled to arrive in Austin Jan. 18 to begin their group
discussions, which will be led by trained moderators provided by
National Issues forum, non-partisan network of citizen
organizations that regularly hold deliberative forums on wide range
of issues.  Discussion guides prepared by Public Agenda and
Kettering Foundation will serve as briefing materials.  All
materials have been reviewed by bipartisan committee of former
govt. officials.

     Discussions with candidates will air live on PBS stations Jan.
20-21.  Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer will moderate
broadcasts, which will be simulcast on NPR.  Wrap-up program Jan.
26 will feature highlights and analysis of NIC.  Poll, developed by
Fishkin, will measure participants' attitudes and opinions before
and after NIC to quantify impact of deliberative process,
organizers said.  NIC will focus on 3 broad issue areas:  economy,
state of American family, U.S. role in post-Cold War world.  Final
broadcast Jan. 26 will reveal poll's results.

     NIC is major component of PBS's The Democracy Project, new
multimedia initiative for news and public affairs programming that
will extend beyond election year.  PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan said he
expects NIC will bring "much-needed perspective" to campaign dialog
as well as "launch an exciting year of presidential election
coverage on public television."

WASHINGTON DEBATE NO LONGER ABOUT ZEROING OUT PTV -- DUGGAN

     PASADENA, Cal. -- Public broadcasters are "confident about our
future," and debate in Washington no longer is about "zeroing out"
noncommercial service but how best to continue funding it,
according to PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan.  At TV critics tour, he said
debate turnaround doesn't mean industry has become "complacent or
comfortable" and that PBS is proud of "the often controversial
programming we offer."

     Speaking of PBS accomplishments during 1995, Duggan said it
was "a tumultuous year, a time more exciting than we would want it
to have been."  While commercial stations lost audience, PBS
remained steady, Duggan said, with 81.7% of American homes tuning
to PTV in Oct.  Among successes, Duggan said, were Home Video
Catalog, "a tremendous success" that went to 6 million Americans; 
PBS online, which he said has been "tremendous boost to our
mission";  partnership with Reader's Digest, which will bring PTV
$75 million over next 5 years;  "audience acclaim" received by PBS
programming in general.

     Among concerns, Duggan said, was drop in corporate
underwriting for PTV programming.  Noncommercial TV receives 86% of
its funding from private sources, only 14% from govt., he said.  As
for proposal some stations have made to Congress to let public
stations advertise products, "the objective truth" is that viewers
and large majority of stations don't want it, Duggan said:  "The
last thing the media world needs is one more commercial channel." 
There would be net loss in income if advertising is added because
of drop in corporate and member contributions, he predicted.

     As for future of govt. funding, Duggan said noncommercial
groups have submitted 11 proposals to Congress and he wouldn't pick
out any one measure as favorite.  Among them was proposed tax on
transfer of commercial stations, which Duggan said would be "just
tiny" fraction of total sales price.  National public broadcasting
organizations, including PBS, currently are pushing proposal that
would allow public stations to lease or sell excess advanced TV
spectrum to capitalize multi-billion dollar trust fund that would
replace govt. funding.  While Duggan refused to endorse proposal to
require commercial stations to air 3 hours weekly of educational
children's programming, he praised "courage and determination" of
FCC Chmn. Hundt in bringing issue before public.  In comments to
FCC, PBS had proposed credit for commercial stations that paid for
production of educational children's programming by public
broadcasters.

     On subject of enhanced underwriting for PBS programming,
Duggan said:  "I'm perfectly happy with that.  We do believe that
enhancing the underwriting message is permissible and we know from
our... research that the audience does not object to that."  He
stressed that programming isn't interrupted:  "We have no appeals
to buy [something].  We have no product pitches... It might be
playing fast and loose with reality to say that we are moving
closer to commercializing" with enhanced announcements.

     PBS said it plans more than 100 hours of primetime programming
covering 1996 presidential campaign.  Titled The Democracy Project,
effort will be headed by Ellen Hume, former Washington
correspondent for Wall St. Journal and N.Y. Times.  Among programs
planned is So You Want to Buy a President, scheduled for Jan. 20
broadcast, which PBS expects to be controversial and will
investigate high cost of national campaigns.

     PBS has been looking for programming head since Jennifer
Lawson resigned last spring in midst of management skake-up.  Major
problem in picking successor, Duggan told us, is that people PBS
has interviewed are making more than $700,000 in commercial TV --
much more than PBS is willing to pay.  Kathy Quattrone has been
filling post on acting basis and she was one of many unable to
travel to southern Cal. to meet with critics because of blizzard in
Northeast.  Also unable to get to Pasadena were Peter, Paul and
Mary, who star in PBS program and were scheduled to entertain.  At
closing PTV session last night (Tues.), several TV critics also
hadn't made it to Cal., because of weather.

     PBS announced several new programming ventures at tour,
including new shows on politics, religion, nature.  Among new
programs will be Bill Moyers series of 10 shows on stories in
Bible's Book of Genesis.  During Genesis:  A Living Conversation
with Bill Moyers, Moyers and group of people from various religious
backgrounds will discuss such topics as Adam and Eve and Redemption
and Noah and the Flood.

     PBS also announced new slate of David Attenborough specials
from BBC, led by 10-part series, World of Birds, for air in 1999. 
Third season of David Attenborough's Natural World -- made up of 10
half-hour explorations of volcanoes, piranhas, butterflies, others
-- begins in 1997.  Also that year, PBS will feature 6 new
Attenborough hour-length animal specials featuring wolves, polar
bears, chimpanzees.  Specials will be part of Nova and Nature
series.

     Also promoted at tour was new American Experience episodes,
including 3-hour biography Reagan, produced by WGBH-TV Boston, and
Great Performances presentation of Les Miserables in Concert.  Les
Miserables was recorded last year at Britain's Royal Albert Hall
and is scheduled to air during March pledge drive.

     Opening lunch on first day of TV critics tour in Pasadena Jan.
8 was hosted by PBS, featuring its 4-part miniseries "Savage
Skies," on the weather.  Unfortunately, blizzard out of East Coast
skies meant many of principals who were to appear to answer
reporters' questions were unable to get from N.Y. to Cal.  Series
is being produced by WNET N.Y.-Newark.  It premieres May 6 on PBS,
will be funded by Marsh & McLellen Cos.

     Public stations were up first at tour, and no money problems
for PTV were in evidence as many gifts and meals rivaled in quality
and quantity those given by commercial networks.  For example, each
reporter received 4 T-shirts promoting different PTV programs.

     Duggan took advantage of his appearance at tour to host Jan.
9 dinner in Bel Air for prominent figures in arts and creative
communities.  Among those attending were studio, corporate and
agency executives.  Dinner honored Beverly Sills, chmn. of N.Y.
Lincoln Center who appeared before critics earlier in day.

CPB AWARDS $8.4 MILLION FOR READY TO LEARN INITIATIVES

     CPB, in what it called "one of the most ambitious efforts to
date to harness the power of public television to teach," has
awarded $8.4 million to fund 2 new daily series for children and 2
accompanying weekly series for parents.  Programs, scheduled to
begin airing in 1997, also will include related online, print and
outreach components to get kids ready for school.  Shows, produced
by partnerships of Children's TV Workshop (CTW)-Columbia TriStar TV
Distribution and WGBH-TV Boston-Sirius Thinking, will join PBS-The
Ready to Learn Service (RTL) program lineup.

     Grants mark first time CPB has funded parent-oriented
programming under RTL and first time RTL has targeted parents with
specific shows.  Until now, RTL has included children's mainstays
Sesame St., Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, Barney & Friends, etc.  CPB
Pres. Richard Carlson called funding "a new vision for television,"
adding that it makes sense to give parents how-to TV when one
considers that each child spends average of more than 4,000 hours
in front of TV by time he or she starts kindergarten.  Carolynn
Reid-Wallace, CPB senior vp-education & programming, predicted that
new shows would become "signature shows and service" for RTL.

     CTW/CTTD partnership will use its $4.2-million grant to
jointly develop 40 episodes of Dragon Tales, animated musical show
designed for preschoolers, and 13 episodes of Show and Tell Me,
live-action series that teaches parents and caregivers how to
participate in their children's learning process.  CPB said Dragon
Tales takes place in "magical world of dragons," with characters
Max and his big sister Margarita, whose parents came to U.S. from
Latin America.  Children travel through storybook to Dragon Land
and journey with their friend Blaze and other "lovable dragons." 
CPB said Blaze will ask viewers to sing, whistle, make silly
sounds, laugh, cry, imitate musical instruments, do animal sounds. 
Show & Tell Me, which will have goal of reinforcing lessons in
Dragon Tales and other RTL shows, will feature celebrity guests,
hidden camera segments, people-on-the-street interviews.  CTW and
CTTD also will develop multimedia material to accompany series,
including on-air and radio interstitial programming, magazines,
internet applications.

     WGBH-TV/Sirius partnership also received $4.2 million for
development and production of 40 episodes of daily, half-hour
literacy series Between the Lions for 4-7-year-olds, and related
13-part weekly half-hour series, Kids & How to Grow Them, for
parents and caregivers.  Interactive Internet component also will
be developed.  CPB said Between the Lions is "first new show in
decades" to promote literacy and teach skills beginning readers
need to master.  Series covers reading, writing, listening and
speaking skills.  Main characters are lions Zazzu and Zig who guard
library doors and teach children about reading.  CPB said once
inside library, viewers are transported to "another dimension"
where books come to life.

     Funding for programs is based in part on recently-awarded
$7-million grant from Education Dept.'s National Early Childhood
Institute.  There currently are 44 stations participating in RTL,
which includes up to 9 hours per day of children's programming
daily.  Broadcast service is complemented by educational materials,
workshops, activity guides, books that reinforce programming's
messages.

QED COMMUNICATIONS HIRES FIRM TO LOBBY ON PTV STATION SALES
LEGISLATION

     QED Communications, parent of WQED Pittsburgh, has hired Dutko
& Assoc., Washington lobby firm, to lobby on legislation affecting
sale of public broadcasting station, QED Communications Pres.
George Miles confirmed.  He said public broadcaster hopes to
convince members of Congress and others that public licensees, WQED
sister station WQEX especially, should have option of using
secondary frequencies for commercial purposes.

     WQED doesn't have any specific new plans for secondary
Pittsburgh market station WQEX, and Miles said using it for
commercial purposes is just one avenue QED Communications is
exploring to raise money to escape $12-million debt.  Miles said he
was hired over year ago (PBR July 29/94 p3) to help station find
solutions to its financial difficulties.  He said QED
Communications is looking at possibility of selling its magazine
and/or other intellectual properties to work down debt.

     WQED is working alone "for the most part" to advance
legislation that would give public broadcasters more flexibility
with extra licenses, Miles said.  Other licensees, however,
including group of northern Va. stations headed by Gen. Mgr. Roger
McIntosh, have been working Capitol Hill looking to loosen
restrictions on uses of 2nd market stations.  Miles said lobby
effort is targeting "everyone... I'll even talk to you."  Rep.
Fields (R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., and Sen.
Pressler (R-S.D.), Senate Commerce Committee chmn., are expected to
draft CPB authorization legislation later this month that could
change way public broadcasters operate.

     While national organizations APTS, PBS, NPR and PRI have
lobbied for bill that would clear way for establishment of trust
fund designed to use leases and sales of excess system advanced TV
(ATV) capacity for financing, some stations have expressed
discomfort with idea of sacrificing their extra licenses for good
of system.  Some, like WQED, have said they believe they should be
free to use these licenses as they see fit to ensure their own
financial stability.  APTS, however, has said that its plan is only
one that would ensure PTV's continued universal availability and
that most stations, although uncertain at outset, have agreed to
support their plan.  Under national organizations' plan, only one
station in each market would make transition to ATV, and other
stations' frequencies would be leased or sold (yet to be
determined) to capitalize trust fund, which also would fund public
radio.

     Stations lobbying on own for legislation that would allow more
commercial enterprises, including advertising and sales/leases of
secondary stations, got boost recently when House Telecom
Subcommittee Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.) told public broadcasting
representatives that he was considering "several ideas," and not
just one, to ensure continued funding for public broadcasting (PBR
Dec 29 p1).  He said he was doubtful public broadcasters would be
able to capitalize $4-billion trust fund through ATV leases/sales
alone.  Fields said if up to him, public broadcasters would have to
follow same rules as commercial counterparts, meaning they would
have to return NTSC spectrum soon after receiving ATV frequencies
and might have to participate in ATV spectrum auctions.  Fields'
staffers in recent months have indicated he is more open to
legislation that would allow stations to experiment with
revenue-raising ventures, including more commercial enterprises, as
long as funds raised are used to further public broadcasting
mission.

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said recently that staff-level
negotiations had rejected White House proposal for broadcasters'
early return of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum. 
Sources said no deal had been reached on spectrum issues as
high-level talks continued at White House.  They also said that
there would be "no giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final
budget deal.  Statement supported assertion by Senate Majority
Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who was reported by Reuters as objecting to
what he called "giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Rep. Fields
(R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., said recently that if
commercial broadcasters must bid in auctions for advanced TV (ATV)
spectrum, then so should public broadcasters.  He also said public
broadcasters wouldn't get any breaks -- if commercial TV stations
have to trade analog spectrum for digital, so should they.  Public
broadcasters have based their trust fund plan on having both analog
and digital spectrum for some time and on having flexibility on
when to switch to digital.  Most public broadcasters would have
difficulty funding equipment needed for ATV transition, and all but
largest producing stations probably would have trouble finding
money to take part in spectrum auctions.  Meanwhile, sources said
some published estimates of value of analog spectrum to be given
back after conversion of broadcasting services to digital have been
wildly exaggerated.  While some reports have put value of spectrum
as high as $70 billion, sources said figure is more in neighborhood
of $6 billion.  That amount, they said, wouldn't reflect costs to
society of having industry and consumers convert to new
technologies before either is ready.  Negotiators also rejected
White House proposal for $1-billion subsidy to consumers to help
them adjust to conversion through purchase of set-top boxes. 
Forcing consumers and industry in short term to use technology that
market hasn't found to be ready could short-circuit development of
ATV, Hill sources said, adding that FCC has wide discretion to
determine whether ATV licenses should be awarded and what
conditions should be attached, including disposition of analog
spectrum.

     Contributions from state govts. and state universities and
colleges accounted for 23.8% of public broadcasting's FY 1994
income, CPB report said, up from 22.4% year earlier.  State govt.
contributions "varied greatly" from state to state, ranging from
zero to $23 million for PTV and zero to more than $3.6 million for
public radio.  Ga. gave more money, $30.4 million, to public
broadcasting than did any other state.  S.C. followed with $23.1
million, N.J. $14.7 million, N.Y. $14.5 million, Ky. $14 million. 
Alaska led states in support for public radio -- $3.6 million --
followed by Fla., $2.2 million;  N.Y., $1.9 million;  Wis., $1.6
million;  Ohio, $1.4 million.
