		<TITLE> International Flight Agencies </TITLE>

In the cooperative agreement between NASA, the international flight agencies and ASF, the flight agencies are responsible for building, launching and maintaining the SAR satellites. The flight agencies communicate with the ASF Mission Planning Specialist to provide ASF with satellite ephemeris data to make tracking the satellites possible and coordinate the exact area to be studied and the precise times the SAR sensor will be activated each day. With this information ASF can track the satellites and downlink the SAR data to tape for shipment to the flight agency and for archive.<P>

<DD> In July of 1991 the European Space Agency (<A HREF="http://www.esrin.esa.it">ESA</A>) launched their first SAR satellite, ESA Remote-Sensing SAR Satellite - 1 or <A HREF="http://services.esrin.esa.it/current.htm">ERS-1</A>. Between the launch of ERS-1 through September 1994, (excluding the initial shakedown and testing phase), ASF has successfully tracked 8,590 ERS-1 passes for a total of 116,097.66 minutes and recorded over 44,227.28 minutes of SAR data. At a downlink rate of 104 Mbit/sec that's 275,978,227,200,000 bits or 34,497,278,400,000 bytes!
<P>
The second ESA SAR satellite, <A HREF="http://services.esrin.esa.it/specers2.htm">ERS-2</A>, was launched in April of 1995. It is very similar to ERS-1 with the addition of at least one new sensor - the Global Ozone Measuring Equipment (GOME).

<DD> In February of 1992, <A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/homepage.html">NASDA</A> launched the first of it's SAR satellites, Japanese Earth Remote-Sensing Satellite - 1 or <A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/satdata/jers_e.html">JERS-1</A>. Between the launch of JERS-1 through September 1994, (excluding the initial shakedown and testing phase), ASF has successfully tracked 2,557 JERS-1 passes for a total of 29,223.68 minutes and recorded 17,817.26 minutes of SAR data. At a downlink rate of 60 Mbit/sec that's 64,142,136,000,000 bits or 8,017,767,000,000 bytes!
