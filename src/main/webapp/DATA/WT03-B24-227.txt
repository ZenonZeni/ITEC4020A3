<h1>ReoPro marketing -- on year later</h1></center>

<b><center>By Karen Bernstein<br>
Editor-in-Chief</b></center><p>
When Eli Lilly launched ReoPro just over a year ago, the slow ramp up of Centocor Inc.'s anti-platelet antibody caught many on Wall Street by surprise. A number of analysts had predicted first year sales for the drug in the range of $70-$150 million. Instead, Lilly's ReoPro sales for 1995 totalled $22.8 million.<p>
The picture brightened over the year. After beginning marketing in February, sales increased every quarter, from $1 million in the first quarter, to $3 million in the second, $6.5 million in the third and $12.3 million in the fourth. By the end of 1995, ReoPro had received formulary approval at more than 70 percent of the Tier I, II and III hospitals that account for 80 percent of the angioplasties in the U.S., according to CNTO President and CEO David Holveck.<p>
Still, the drug ran into resistance on several of fronts, among them the increasing use of stents and the bleeding issues associated with use of ReoPro and heparin. In addition, the some hospitals resisted the up front-costs of ReoPro because they would be unable to capture the presumed cost savings from the drug's effect on complications from angioplasty procedures, which would come downstream <i>(see BioCentury, April 24, 1995).</i><p>
A year later, cardiologists have more experience working with the GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor, and CNTO and Lilly have more selling. Most importantly, the companies now have data from two clinical trials that were halted early because of positive outcomes -- the EPILOG all comers angioplasty trial and the CAPTURE refractory unstable angina study <i>(see BioCentury Extras, Dec. 15 and Dec. 21, 1995).</i> Those trials have added important information on how to control bleeding by administering lower doses of weight-adjusted heparin with ReoPro, which both should improve patient outcomes and shift the cost/benefit toward the drug. <p>
In addition, the CAPTURE data provide a rationale for extending use of ReoPro from the catheterization lab into community hospitals, where non-interventional cardiologists would use the drug to stabilize patients with unstable angina.<p>
<b><center>New economic model</b></center>
CNTO hasn't recalculated the economic model that came out of the original EPIC study. Based on that model, ReoPro saved $1,100-$1,200 per patient at six months, while the drug costs $1,350. By reducing the need for transfusions and extra time in the hospital to manage bleeding, the company expects that the cost advantage has been tilted in favor of ReoPro, Holveck said. The company expects to submit its economic analysis of the EPILOG data to the FDA by the end of the year, he said.<p>
The key pharmacoeconomic battle isn't over the savings at six months, but on the savings in the acute setting, he said. "So a good portion of the economic sales pitch in reality has been focused on the drug's effectiveness in getting patients in and out of the cath lab." Part of the savings comes by eliminating the need for pretreating patients with one or two days of heparin or with ticlopidine, a platelet mediator, Holveck said. ReoPro also saves time during procedures by eliminating or reducing the need to fight thrombus, which means more patients can be moved through the cath lab, he said. Finally, with fewer adverse events after procedures, patients can get out of the hospital faster.<p>
But even absent definitive pharmacoeconomic data, marketing of ReoPro will be helped by the confirmatory efficacy and safety data provided by multiple clinical studies, Holveck said. "In retrospect, while you can get approval based on one trial, the medical community likes to see another trial. We started to pick up momentum after December. Having been through the pharmacy committees prior to that allowed us to have a quicker build after the data came out."<p>
The sales pitch for ReoPro also has evolved away from a message that put the drug into competition with stents, Holveck said. "The initial launch emphasized the use of ReoPro to reduce abrupt closure, which caused competition. The message today is, 'If you're going to use any devices, it's better to have ReoPro on board.' People feel comfortable with both, especially if they're going to stent smaller vessels. That's all starting to come together."<p>
Lilly's sales reps haven't yet started targeting the non-invasive cardiologists whose practices are likely to be affected by the CAPTURE data, Holveck said. That process will start at the American College of Cardiology meeting this week in Orlando, Fla. "I think non-invasive cardiologists will be interested when a patient presents with hot unstable angina," he said. "You can cool them down with ReoPro and then transport them to cath labs."<p>
Holveck said he doesn't know if the education process will be as long for this group of cardiologists. "People have said to me that non-invasive cardiologists are more pharmacologically in tune, but I don't know. I've talked to a few and they seem to have a quicker grasp of how to manage patients with drugs."<p>
To get a sense of how the clinical community has reacted to the new data and to the past year's experience with the drug, BioCentury surveyed five hospitals about their use of ReoPro in the past year and their projections going forward.<p>

<h3>The Cleveland Clinic</h3>
The Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio) spent about $300,000 on ReoPro in 1995 to treat about 225 patients, according to Tom Franko, quality assurance pharmacist at the clinic. He expects use to increase this year, although he's not sure by how much.<p>
Part of the increased use, Franko said, will be driven by the positive data from the CAPTURE and EPILOG trials.<p>
"Those studies showed it was unethical to continue the studies as far as the placebo group was concerned," Franko said. "We will review use based on the new studies to understand which patients will benefit -- we have to do that. Ethically, there are issues regarding quality of life, mortality and morbidity. The organization will look for opportunities of direct benefit to patients and proceed accordingly."<p>
The Cleveland Clinic hasn't quantified the cost/benefit of ReoPro, a calculation that now may be more complicated because CAPTURE and EPILOG showed a benefit on mortality. <p>
"I don't know how to quantitate the value of a life," Franko said. "The experience with alteplase (Genentech's Activase tPA) gives you an idea that these agents will be used. Alteplase is very costly, but has 70 percent of the market, and it saves 1 life per 100. I don't yet know how cardiologists will use the agent based on the new studies, but we won't wait until the studies are published to increase use."<p>
The clinic still is analyzing its 1995 costs of ReoPro, to see if the HCFA reimbursement for angioplasty covered the addition of ReoPro to the procedure. The clinic also is studying the combined use of ReoPro with stents.<p>
As of now, the clinic is still using the drug only in high-risk angioplasty patients and is making use decisions on a case-by-case basis, he said.<p>

<h3>Texas Heart Institute</h3>
Texas Heart Institute in Houston used ReoPro in about 250 angioplasty patients in 1995, and expects usage to rise this year. "We're now using it in 25-40 percent of all of our angioplasties," said Terry Ferguson, associate director of cardiology research. "It's still targeted to high-risk angioplasty, but high risk is in the eye of the beholder. I'd be surprised if usage crept above 40 percent, but with the EPILOG results, who knows?"<p>
The institute spent $800,000 to $1.2 million on the drug in 1995, with use starting in April. This year, usage may increase by about 25 percent, Ferguson said.<p>
About half of the usage is in combination with stents. Cardiologists at the institute use stents in 40-50 percent of their procedures. They do close to 2,000 angioplasties annually.<p>
Importantly, the circumstances in which ReoPro is given have shifted dramatically as physicians have become more comfortable with the drug. Initially, 75-80 percent of use was for bailout, after other interventions had failed. Prophylaxis accounted for only 15-20 percent of use, Ferguson said. That has now reversed, with 75-80 percent of use for prophylactic purposes.<p>
It's not yet clear how much impact EPILOG and CAPTURE will have, because cardiologists at the institute are already believers in the drug, Ferguson said. Nevertheless, he said EPILOG in particular may have "far-reaching implications" because it extends the benefit to low-risk patients. <p>
The results of CAPTURE, which was aimed at patients who present with symptoms at community hospitals, ultimately could extend use, he said. But as with cardiac catheterization labs, Ferguson expects that doctors at community hospitals will need to go through the same learning curve before ramping up use of ReoPro.<P>
Ferguson said that while he doesn't have hard numbers on ReoPro, "my suspicion is that it is cost effective and what we're saving in terms of downstream complications is covering the cost of ReoPro." <p>
Purchases are still affected by ongoing clinical trials of other therapies where patients receive drugs for free, but that impact may be limited by the good ReoPro data. "Since EPIC and EPILOG, you've changed the standard that people are held up to," Ferguson said. "So ethically you need to work out some sort of mechanism so you can give ReoPro." <p>
Among ongoing trials are a ReoPro/stent study, trials of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors from Merck and Roche, and oral GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors from Roche/Genentech and Boehringer Ingelheim, he said. <p>
<h3>Herman Hospital, University of Texas </h3>
Despite its location in the same city as the Texas Heart Institute, the experience of Herman Hospital cardiologists is an object lesson in the obstacles ReoPro continues to face among cardiologists who remain focused on heparin.<p>
H. Vernon (Skip) Anderson, a cardiologist at the hospital, estimates that about two dozen patients received ReoPro in 1995, out of a total of about 650 angioplasties. The drug was given primarily to two groups of patients: patients with acute myocardial infarction who had failed thrombolytics and received angioplasty; and patients with unstable angina with a thrombus in the vessel who were to receive angioplasty, or who developed a thrombus in the vessel during intervention. He doubts the number of patients who receive the drug will increase by anything close to 25 percent this year.<p>
The primary issue among Herman Hospital cardiologists -- though not with Anderson, who participated in the EPILOG trial and is familiar with how to use ReoPro -- is bleeding. "We've had some bleeding problems -- a number of groin bleeds and internal bleeds -- and it has soured some people a little bit," he said. "The problem is heparin. I, being familiar with the data, understand the necessity of weight-adjusted heparin. But I have not been successful in educating enough of my colleagues around here. The dominant attitude is, 'If there's a thrombus in the vessel, I need more heparin, not less.' So increased usage depends on getting out that message. Right now there's a very negative impression of ReoPro: that it's a dangerous drug and you have to be careful when you give it. Getting the EPILOG results out should help."<p>
Another factor in the low ReoPro usage at Herman Hospital is stent use. "People like stents," Anderson said. "They have low restenosis rates and people say they can use a stent and give patients aspirin instead of an expensive drug. I point out that you can only use stents in 50 percent of patients."<p>
There are several ongoing trials at Herman, including a stent trial and the ReoPro/stent trial. One trial that Anderson would like to see is of ReoPro in patients who've had previous vein grafts. "We see a fair amount of people who've had grafts before. I'd like to see data on ReoPro use in patients coming in for angioplasty on eight, 10 or 12-year old vein grafts."<p>

<h3>Lennox Hill Hospital</h3>
ReoPro is being used in about 10 percent of the cardiac interventions at Lennox Hill Hospital in New York. The 1,600 interventions performed annually include angioplasty, stents and rotoblator procedures, according to Jeffrey Moses, a cardiologist at the hospital. Only about 20 percent of the hospital's procedures are pure angioplasties, he said. About 65 percent involve stents.<p>
The goal of Lennox Hill is to keep ReoPro usage at about the 10 percent level. The cath lab's complication rate is very low -- below 1 percent for infarctions and out-of-lab closures, Moses said. "With that low a baseline, how much lower can you get?"<p>
At those complication rates, he said, it would cost $300,000 to $400,000 to lower the infarct rate. "The dilemma isn't whether it's a good drug, it's an economic issue now," Moses said.<p>
Because using ReoPro on all patients would be too expensive, the hospital is setting up a formal policy and procedures for its use. Last year, clinicians reached a consensus that ReoPro was appropriate where there was thrombus, myocardial infarction, vein grafts, or vessels too small or too distal to stent, Moses said. The guidelines will be finalized this year.<p>
Lennox Hill was an early adopter of ReoPro, so the data from the EPILOG trial haven't had much of an impact on use. The hospital has had one cerebral bleed with use of the drug. Moses' solution to the potential for bleeding is to omit the use of heparin when he's giving ReoPro. "Except in unusual situations, I just don't use heparin with it. I let ReoPro carry the day."<p>
As for the impact of the CAPTURE trial, Moses has doubts as to how widely the drug will be used at community centers, except in special situations. "I don't see any role for ReoPro in community hospitals," he said. "CAPTURE was done in settings where angioplasty was scheduled for the next day, where you knew you'd be done in 24 hours. But if I'm at a community hospital, I don't know if it will be done the next day. Say I give ReoPro on Tuesday, and the angioplasty is done on Friday. You can't redose because of the potential antibody response. We don't yet know enough about how important the antibody issue is."<p>

<h3>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</h3>
ReoPro use has gone up at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles over the past year from the 10 percent of the 850 annual angioplasties originally projected to about 30 percent of patients. The center initially issued guidelines that the drug not be used in stented patients -- which constitute 80 percent of its patients -- but it quickly became clear that these patients were most likely to benefit from ReoPro, because they were already the most at risk for reclosure, according to Charles Lacy, director of drug information services.<P>
Along the way, Cedars-Sinai surveyed the guidelines of 20 hospitals that perform more than 300 angioplasties annually. All had seen increased use of ReoPro over the course of 1995, from initial rates of 5-20 percent to an average use in 33 percent of angioplasty patients by year end, Lacy said. He noted that one institution was keeping use to 20 percent by acting as the purchasing agent for the cath lab and making the cath lab pay for drug. <P>
The center also did a cost analysis of its own patient population, comparing costs for stented patients with and without ReoPro, and unstented patients with and without ReoPro. "We found the cost of care was much greater in the patients who received ReoPro than in those who didn't,  for a net loss of $2,000 per patient on average," Lacy said.<p>
But the study also illustrated the pitfalls of cost/benefit analyses. "It was a flawed study because the patients who received ReoPro were sicker patients, so it wasn't ReoPro per se that was causing the increased costs," Lacy said. "But it did identify the worst case-scenario of loss for the hospital."<p>
By the fourth quarter, use was up to 30 percent of patients. "This was in part because of the successes seen in use and the small numbers of adverse effects," Lacy said. "Bleeding really only occurred in patients who shouldn't have gotten the drug, such as older or smaller individuals, or those who had already had a bleeding episode."<p>
As a result, Cedars-Sinai revamped its ReoPro guidelines. "We changed the criteria to include stent patients, and we changed the contraindication of low weight to a strong warning to always weight-adjust heparin," Lacy said. "We also changed to include patients who had recently received thrombolysis such as tPA or streptokinase. We had originally said it was contraindicated for those patients."<p>
There have been two bleeding episodes at Cedars-Sinai, one of which was an eye bleed that resulted in blindness, the other being a minor bleed from the catheter site. Both patients were poor candidates for therapy, Lacy said.<p>
Once the EPILOG data appeared, the center also decided to be proactive in adjusting its practice to fit the new information, even though the data haven't been published and subjected to full scientific scrutiny. "EPILOG has definitely increased use," he said. "Everything that was contraindicated before is at worst now a strong warning: patient weight, age, prior thrombolytic use, even prior ReoPro use." Even though the data are unpublished, "it's better to budget for it now," Lacy said.<p>
Use also has been extended to lower-risk patients with grade C lesions but not necessarily a clot. The presence of a lesion implies that these patients are at risk for negative consequences. Previously, use was restricted to patients in whom a clot could be seen.<p>
<b><center>Budgeting</b></center><p>
The center is building a formal budget for ReoPro. "We're anticipating final use in 35 percent of patients," Lacy said. The center is paying the full price of $1,350, in line with the other hospitals surveyed -- the drug doesn't appear to be widely discounted.<p>
Next to be considered will be the CAPTURE data. Even more so than the EPILOG data, the implications for CAPTURE to hospital budgets are daunting. "I don't know what we'll do if the data are of the same gravity as the EPILOG data -- and it looks like it is," Lacy said.<p>
Unlike Moses at Lennox Hill, Lacy said that Cedars-Sinai cardiologists aren't convinced that ReoPro will be restricted to one-time use. "If you believe just because it's an antibody you can't use it twice, then use in the CAPTURE setting would be restricted to patients who would be PTCA (angioplasty) candidates very shortly." he said. "However our cardiologists who've looked at this suggest that the 6-1/2 percent of patients who develop antibodies to ReoPro are just developing antibodies consistent with reactions to any large molecule. That's because the presence of antibodies hasn't translated into any kind of negative reaction like anaphylaxis."<p>
Lacy expects that cardiologists will experiment, giving ReoPro to patients who already have received it once. Likely candidates are high-risk patients who are receiving a second angioplasty, with stents. "When the patient is saved, with no bleeding, no restenosis, and no anaphylaxis, we'll see physicians starting to use it no matter what the FDA says."<p>
If that proves to be the case, and the CAPTURE data in non-interventional settings hold up, then "it could easily double, triple or infinitely increase the number of doses we need," Lacy said. <p>
"The bottom line is that our concern and expectation is that use of this drug will greatly increase," he said. "Originally, the manufacturer suggested it should be used in 30 percent of patients. We thought that was too high and expected it to be used in 10-15 percent, though we were trying to keep it at 5-10 percent. Now it's turning out the projection of the manufacturer is too low."<p>
Thus in the short term, Lacy expects that use of ReoPro will increase dramatically. However, in two to five years he anticipates that use will decline as other drugs and alternative therapies enter the market. These will range, he predicted, from other GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, to excimer laser angioplasties, to stents impregnated with heparin. The latter, he said are showing similar mortality reductions to ReoPro in large clinical trials.<p>
Finally, Cedars-Sinai is trying to minimize wastage of the drug, which comes in 10 mg vials costing $450. Patients receive an average of 24.7 mg, wasting about 5.3 mg per patient. "The company now accepts back partial vials, and we're exploring the best mechanism for storing that and reducing our overall costs," Lacy said. "The drug should be priced at a cost per milligram."<p>
