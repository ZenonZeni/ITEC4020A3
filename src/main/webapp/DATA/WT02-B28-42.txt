<B><FONT SIZE=4>Quarterly Economic Update</FONT></B><BR>
<STRONG>November 1996</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Back to above trend growth in 1997</STRONG><BR>
After surging to 4.7 percent in the second quarter, real GDP growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the third quarter. Stagnating consumer spending, along with sharp declines in housing, government purchases, and net exports were offset by a surge in business investment and inventory accumulation.  In the fourth quarter, growth should remain sluggish due to a slower rate of inventory accumulation, but final demand is set to pick up again.  With real disposable income up about 3.0 percent from a year ago and the unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent from 5.6 percent, consumer confidence is near a seven-year high.  Under these conditions, the recent decline in bond yields and the surging stock market should encourage a revival in housing as well as a good Christmas shopping season.
<P>
For the second half of the year, real GDP growth is expected to average about 2.1 percent -- well below the first half average of 3.3 percent and slightly below the economy's long-term non-inflationary growth potential. Once the inventory correction is over, however, the economy should have the momentum to maintain above trend growth until it is slowed by the Federal Reserve.  For the year as a whole, economic activity should be up a moderate 2.3 percent, and 1997 is expected to show a stronger 2.9 percent increase, with help from strengthening economies in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Mexico.
<P>
<STRONG>Inflation still subdued, but set for upward creep</STRONG><BR>
After six years of economic expansion, there are still few signs of accelerating inflation.  However, the unemployment rate has fallen well below levels previously associated with rising inflation, and wage rates have begun to accelerate again.  So far, decelerating benefit costs have offset most of the wage acceleration, but this cannot continue indefinitely.  The current slowdown has been just in time to relieve these emerging inflationary pressures, but as the economy picks up speed again next year, they are likely to reemerge.  Any slack created by the slowdown will be quickly eliminated as growth picks up again, and more definitive inflationary pressures will emerge.  After rising 2.8 percent in 1995, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) should be up 3.0 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 1997.
<P>
<STRONG>Fed tightening postponed</STRONG><BR>
Following three easing moves, the Federal Reserve has left monetary policy unchanged since February and is not likely to begin tightening credit conditions again until some time next year.  There appears to be increasing political pressure to wait and see how long the economic slowdown lasts or how low unemployment can fall before inflation picks up again.  It may be that the rate of unemployment that sparks inflation has indeed shifted downward somewhat in recent years due to demographics and other factors, but as it becomes clear that the unemployment rate has resumed its downward movement, the Fed is likely to begin a series of tightening moves. 
<P>

<STRONG>Bond yield up-trend to resume</STRONG><BR>
Long-term bond yields have declined from their recent highs in response to the Federal Reserve's decisions not to tighten monetary policy at its September and November FOMC meetings and economic statistics that appear to have justified these decisions.  Post-election promises to continue budget deficit reduction efforts also have helped.  As the economy picks up again next year, however, the up-trend in interest rates, both short- and long-term, should resume and continue until the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy again.  This is likely to require a flattening of the yield curve, with short-term interest rates rising faster than long-term rates.
<P>
<STRONG>Ideal equity market conditions not likely to continue</STRONG><BR>  
When the economy is near full employment, too much growth is just as bad for the stock market as too little.  So far this year, the economy has been just right.  The bull market for equities has been driven by the continuation of moderate growth, strong earnings gains, and low inflation.  These ideal conditions are likely to change next year.  While earnings should remain relatively good, economic growth may look a little too strong, inflation will be creeping up again, bond yields will be rising, and the Federal Reserve will be tightening.  As the economic expansion continues into its seventh year, there will be increasing concerns about the emergence of late business cycle pressures on profitability and the arrival of the next recession.
