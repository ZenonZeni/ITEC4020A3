<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The possible impact that pipeline construction and maintenance can have on wetlands is a sensitive issue.  Until now, there have been few quantitative data to guide the regulatory community and the natural gas industry in restoring pipeline corridors to their original condition.  The recent emphasis on "no net loss" of wetlands, with resulting wetland banking strategies, has imposed both financial burdens and uncertainty on pipeline companies in planning the future development of pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs).  Documented studies are needed to define the type, significance, and duration of environmental consequences associated with past pipeline practices.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory's field team of botanists, ecologists, engineers, and soil scientists conducted one-time surveys of 13 wetland crossings and two surveys each on two wetland crossings for eight different pipelines throughout the eastern, midwestern, and southern United States between 1990 and 1992.  The communities chosen represented a diversity of wetland types, installation techniques, and maintenance practices.   A taxonomist, specializing in local flora, joined the team at each site.   At the time of the surveys, the wetland crossings ranged in age from 1 to 31 years.  Data were collected on the vegetation that became established on the ROWs and in adjacent, undisturbed wetlands.  The percent of area coverage collected for each species on the ROW and on adjacent wetlands was used to evaluate similarities and differences between plant communities.  Changes to topography, soils, and hydrology attributable to ROW construction were documented, along with impacts on rare, threatened, endangered, or sensitive species.  The study verified that current environmental regulations and pipeline technology are effective in limiting undesirable impacts to wetlands.  The current recommendation to seed wetland ROWs annually with ryegrass is not necessary and may only serve to delay establishment of native vegetation.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
The results indicated that ROWs installed under recent wetland regulations normally are revegetated within a few years after site closure with dense, diverse plant life similar to that in adjacent natural areas.  These plant communities have propagated from naturally available species without special soil treatment or artificial seeding.  Traditional maintenance by periodic mowing has been successful in allowing an herb stratum to develop.
<P>
While ROWs encourage plant and habitat diversity for wetlands, there is no evidence that they degrade wetlands by encouraging the growth or spread of invasive, non-native plant species.  Most negative impacts are short-term, diminishing with time.  Older ROWs, developed before current regulations went into effect, had fewer positive results than those developed within the last several years.
<P>
Natural gas pipeline companies recognize the Wetland Corridors Program as a unique data bank on wetland recovery.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
One pipeline company has approached Argonne to survey some of its wetland crossings in similar fashion and compare the findings with the previously established data bank.  Continuous studies are needed to document more precisely the duration of observed effects, the impacts of recent regulations limiting maintenance to only the central portion of ROWs, and further comparisons of directional drilling and open trenching.  Studies are also needed to document potential fragmentation of various habitats and identify techniques to avoid this condition.
