Carliner, Geoffrey.  1996.  The Wages and Language Skills of US Immigrants.

NBER Working Paper 5763.  September. http://nber.harvard.edu/<p>

Foreign-born workers earned about $0.50 less than US-born workers in 1989,

with the hourly wage gap largest for Mexican-born immigrants.  The gap is

widest upon arrival and closes by 0.8 percent per year after arrival, so that,

e.g. a 10 percent wage gap ($10 for US-born workers and $9 for foreign-born

workers) would be closed within about 12 years.<p>

Huddle, Donald.  1996. The Net Costs of Immigration: The Facts, the Trends

and the Critics.  Washington, DC. Carrying Capacity Network.

800-466-4866.<p>

This study estimates that immigration cost the US a net $65 billion in

1996, including $50 billion more in government expenditures on behalf of

immigrants than the immigrants pay in taxes.  In addition, Huddle estimates

that immigrants cost $15 billion for indirect worker displacement costs such as

unemployment benefits.<p>

Two thirds of the costs, or $41 billion, are attributed to legal

immigration.  According to Huddle, immigration's net costs will rise over the

next decade.<p>

The Urban Institute, in a 1994 publication, Immigration and Immigrants:

Setting the Record Straight, concluded that immigration results net balance of

government revenues that are $25 billion to $30 billion more than the

government spends on immigrants.<p>

Simon, Julian. 1995.  Immigration: The Demographic and Economic Facts. Cato

Institute: Washington, DC.  <p>

This 51-page monograph argues that little has changed in immigration except

the "anti-immigrant" rhetoric.  According to Simon, the 3.2 million illegal

aliens estimated to be in the US in October 1992 is about unchanged since the

early 1980s, and immigrant families receive an average $1,400 in welfare

payments in their first five years in the US, versus $2,300 for natives

(immigrants are not eligible for the same benefits as natives).<p>

Simon asserts that, on average, immigrant families contribute $2,500 more

in taxes than they draw in publicly-funded benefits.<p>

UN Development Program.  1996. Human Development Report 1996.  The UN's

seventh annual Human Development Report reported that there are 89 countries in

which the average person is worse off than in the mid-1980s.  In 19 countries,

including Ghana, Haiti, Liberia, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Venezuela, per capita

income is below the 1960 level.<p>

The UNDP ranks Canada first among 174 nations in human development, even

though Canada was only one of three rich countries--the other two were Finland

and Ireland--considered worse off today than in 1980.  The next countries in

the ranking, which combines life expectancy, education and purchasing power,

are the US and Japan.<p>
