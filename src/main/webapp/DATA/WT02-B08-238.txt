<h3>Scott Polar Research Institute</h3>

<H2>A brief history of the Scott Polar Research Institute</H2>


</CENTER>
<p>



The Scott Polar Research Institute was founded in 1920, in Cambridge, as a memorial to Captain Scott and 
his four companions who died returning from the South Pole in 1912. When Scott's last words, "For God's sake 
look after our people" were made known to the British nation, the response was tremendous.  Scott himself 
had emphasised the importance of science and from this plea, the Institute was born.

The Institute is the oldest international centre for Polar Research within a university. Seventy-five
years of scientific exploration, collection, recording and interpretation of results makes it a unique
institution.  Many other institutes concerned with polar issues have grown up with around it: the
British Antarctic Survey, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the Cambridge Arctic Shelf
Project, the <a href="wdcc.htm">World Data Centre C (Glaciology)</a>, the International Glaciological
Society and the International Whaling Commission. <P>

In 1960, the Ford Foundation enabled the Institute to meet the challenge of an explosion in polar
information following World War II.  Now, once again, the Institute has embarked on a major expansion
of the <a href="lib/libhome.htm">library</a> to serve the needs of the research community into the
future.  This planned extension will be named the <b>Shackleton Memorial Library</b> in honour of the
contributions made to polar research by Sir Ernest Shackleton and his son, Lord Shackleton.

<b>Terence Armstrong</b>, the polar geographer, died on 21st February 1996. 
Harry King wrote an <a href="terence.htm">obituary</a> which appeared in <i>The 
Guardian</i>.
