<h2>GENERAL RESEARCH INTEREST:</h2>


         My general interest is on the biochemistry/physiology of spermand male reproductive cells.  Three main
lines of research I have been focusing on in the last 11 years are:<br>
<table cellspacint=10>
<tr><td valign=top>     1.  <td>     The cell biology/biochemistry of sperm capacitation and sperm-egg interaction. This line
             of research has been performed since 1985 when I first joined the human In Vitro Fertilization
             (IVF) Program at Beth Israel Hospital,Boston.  The information obtained from this study
             is pertinent to the IVF process.  The present focus on this research studies is an characterization
             and discerning the role of sulfogalactosylglycerolipid (SGG) and its binding protein (sulfolipidimmobilizing
             protein 1-SLIP1) as sperm capacitation and sperm-egg interaction.  See details for research
             support below.
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>     2.  <td>     Male contraception.  I started to be interested in this  line of research since I was in Thailand,
             my homeland country, as it is one of the most populated countries in the world.  This interest
             was carried on when I moved to Harvard Medical School in 1981.  Specifically, I was studying
             the molecular mechanisms of gossypol, a male contraceptive used in China, on Sertoli cells. 
             From 1981-1987, I received a number of operating grants for this study including four
             from the Rockefeller Foundation and one from World Health Organization as well as one
             subcontract from NIH through H.G. Pars Company.  I held one grant (1989-1992) on
             the effects of gossypol on kidney cells from the Rockefeller Foundation.  In addition, it
             is expected that the obtained information from the study described in 1) would lead to development
             of  immunocontraceptives and vaginal contraceptives based on molecules specific to gametes. 
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>     3.   <td>    Reproductive biotechnology related to the IVF.  I have developed interest in alleviating
             male infertility problems using laboratory procedures.  This line of my research interest
             was funded by NSERC as well as operating fund from the human IVF program (GOAL)
             at the Ottawa Civic Hospital.</tr>
</table>
         I was in Thailand from 1975 to 1981 as a  faculty member and an independent investigator in the Department
of Biochemistry, Mahidol University.  My research interest, additional to the male contraception field (as described
above), lied in the fields of the structure of sperm chromatin (as evidenced by publications #9-11, 14-16), sperm
maturation and sperm motility (as evidenced by publications #6-7, 10).  These research activities were supported
by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, World Health Organization, International Planned Parenthood
Foundation (IPPF), and the NRC of Thailand.<br>

Relevant Experience to the Thai Canadian HRD Project:  I am a Thai citizen who understands the Thai culture and
language very well.  I have experience as a faculty member and a research scientist in Thai, American and Canadian
academic institutes.  Although I have lived in North America for the past 12 years, I still keep in touch with Thai colleagues
by yearly visit, which includes seminar presentation at various universities.  In addition, I had several Thai scientists
working in my laboratory.  I keep in touch with other Thai professionals in North America and serve as a task force
member to the Association of Thai Professionals in America and Canada.  Furthermore, I regularly attend international
meetings and conferences and have numerous connections with scientists around the world.  My research activities
have been funded both by international organizations as well as MRC Canada.  My research and expertise in reproductive
technology has allowed me to work closely with clinicians in the human In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer
Programs and in clinically-oriented research projects.  The clinical treatment, applied science and technology are important
for generating revenues for sustaining the proposed Thai-Canadian HRD Project.  
<br><br>
     A number of Thai scientists and clinicians have been trained in my laboratory at the Loeb Research Institute,
these include Drs. Sopit Wongkham and Malivalaya Namking (participants in this Linkage Program) and clinician,
Dr. Pansak Sugkraroek, Praram 9 Hospital, (a collaborative Partner Institute in this Linkage Program) 
<br><br>
     Recently, I have written a Planning Mission and Visit Proposal to CIDA which was awarded to support Drs.
Sopit Wongkham and Kamoltip Brown to visit the University of Ottawa (March 30, 1994 to April 12, 1994).  After
meetings and discussions with a number of the Canadian faculty members, we have prepared this CIDA Linkage Project.
