<h3>Treaty of Rome (as amended)</h3>

<h4>Article 30</h4>
Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall, without prejudice to the following provisions, be prohibited between Member States<p>

<h4>Article 36</h4>
The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of .... the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants;.....<br>
Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discriminations or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States<p>

<hr>
<h3>The "Cassis de Dijon" Case</h3>

In the absence if common rules, obstacles to movement within the Community resulting from disparities between the national laws relating to the marketing of a product must be accepted in so far as those provisions may be recognised as being necessary in order to satisfy mandatory requirements relating in particular to the effectiveness of fiscal supervision, the protection of public health, the fairness of commercial transactions and the defence of the consumer.<p>

There is therefore no valid reason why, provided they have been lawfully produced and marketed in one Member State, alcoholic beverages should not be introduced into any other Member State.<p>
<hr>

The Community shall adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992, in accordance with the provisions of this Article and of Articles ..... and without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty.<p>

The internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty.<p>

<h4>Article 100a</h4>
By way of derogation from Article 100 and save where otherwise provided in this Treaty, the following provisions shall apply for the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 7a.  The Council shall, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b [co-decision] and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, adopt the measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulations or administrative action in Member States which have as their objective the establishment or functioning of the internal market.<p>
