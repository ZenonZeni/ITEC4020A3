<i><u>Professor J.F. Keffer </i></u><p>
     Experimental and computational research in turbulance such as jets, wakes, boundary layers,
and complex turbulent flows as applied to oceanographic, limnological and meteorological 
environments, using computer analysis, digital imaging, flow visualization, pattern recognition,
and CFD.<p>

<i><u>Professor M.R. Loewen</u></i><p>
Research is being conducted in several areas of Environmental Engineering.  Air-sea gas
exchange is important when considering the build-up of carbon dioxide and other greehouse
gases in the atmosphere.  Our group is currently developing a system of fiber optic probes to
measure the size distributions of large bubbles entrained by breaking ocean waves.  The long-
term objective of the proposed research is to determine the importance of the large bubbles
entrained by breaking waves to air-sea gas exchange.  Funding for this project is provided by
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and NSERC.  In addition, we are conducting a study
of the effects of zebra mussels in the western basin of Lake Erie.  This project includes field
experiments to measure the relevant physical and biological parameters in situ and numerical
modelling of the complex physical and biological interactions.  This research is funded by the
Great Lakes University Research Fund.  The transport of toxic chemicals between the atmosphere
and the Great Lakes is the focus of a field study sponsored by Atmospheric Environment
Services of Environment Canada.  The objective of the study is to determine the importance of
extreme atmospheric events (i.e. storms) in enhancing the air-water transfer of gaseous
pollutants.<p>

<i><u>Professor A. Mandelis</u></i><p>
 Research and Development of a family of new solid-state gas sensors for environmental
pollution monitoring, and primarily for hydrogen and helium trace gas detection, with a view
to the era of safe hydrogen energy production and utilization.  The sensors are photothermal and
chemical in nature and use optical fiber technology for signal generation, rather than the
conventional electrical signal generation of other gas sensors.<p>

<i><u>Professor L. Shu</u></i><p>
The goal of this research is to enable environmentally responsible product design.  Such design aims to produce minimal environmental impact during product manufacture, life, recycling, and disposal.  Resource inputs and waste outputs over the product life-cycle are useful metrics for comparing environmental impact of various product designs.  

Computer tools and optimization methods are used to determine minimal-impact designs for particular applications and to develop general guidelines for environmentally conscious product design.<p>  

<i><u>Professor M. Thomson</u></i><p>
Experimental and numerical studies of the control of air pollution from 
industrial sources.  Examining new air pollution control techniques such as 
using of additives to reduce organic air emissions and improving 
turbulent mixing to reduce carbon monoxide levels.  Investigating the 
pollutant generating processes using a laboratory combustor. Developing 
predictive models of the fluid flow and chemical reactions that control 
pollutant formation.<p>
