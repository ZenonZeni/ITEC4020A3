The New Face Of Client/Server -- Vendors, integrators see intranets
as key to short-term profits

By:
TOM SMITH

New York-The Internet has gained major strategic importance
among top client/server players, but the short-term profit
potential remains murky, according to executives attending
CRN 's annual Client/Server Summit.

In the short run, much of the industry's focus will be on intranets
internal corporate communications based on the Internet. Systems
integrators said intranets are one clear money maker, and database
vendors said those intranets present a major opportunity to
sell their relational databases as back ends to World Wide
Web home pages.

"The biggest market for all of this [Internet activity] is going
to be inside companies," said Phil White, chairman, president
and chief executive of Informix Software Inc., Menlo Park,
Calif. "That's going to drive a lot of business in '96 and
'97."

Informix sent a clear message about its view of the Internet's
strategic importance shortly after the roundtable. The database
provider disclosed an agreement to acquire Illustra Information
Technologies Inc., Oakland, Calif., in a stock transaction
valued at nearly $400 million, to strengthen its Web capabilities.

Informix, which until recently has held a steadfast line against
growth through acquisition, will pay more than 10 times the
estimated revenue of Illustra. Informix said the deal will
enable it to integrate Illustra technology for managing complex
data, such as Web data, into its core database.

Other roundtable participants, including channel executives,
said intranets have emerged as a hot button among customers.
"We think that's going to be a pretty big extension to what's
happening in the Internet," said Jim Sims, president and chief
executive of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc., Cambridge,
Mass.

Several participants cited the Web's potential to loosen Microsoft
Corp.'s long-standing stranglehold on the desktop and the client,
given the Web's ease of use and increasing presence. This is
good news for all software vendors, they said, because it means
a more open market.

"It is obviously an opportunity to change the industry paradigm
which, at least at the client end, is quickly becoming a monopoly,"
said Ray Lane, president of worldwide operations and a board
member at Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.

"Obviously, if you are a large software company you want to
see that remain open," Lane added.

Mitchell Kertzman, executive vice president of Sybase Inc.,
Emeryville, Calif., characterized the World Wide Web interface
as "probably the best, easiest, most intuitive user interface
that's been developed. I think the real breakthrough is the
user interface breakthrough."

But another industry hot button, the low-cost computer with
built-in Internet access, dubbed the Internet computer or network
computer (NC), was given less upbeat assessments. Internet
computers have been touted aggressively by Oracle Corp., Sun
Microsystems Inc., IBM Corp. and others, though none have actually
shipped.

"In my view, the NC stands for no chance," White said.

Kertzman predicted such devices will find the greatest applicability
in mobile and home devices, rather than in corporate America.

With two exceptions, most participants found it difficult to
identify specific revenue and profit figures related to Internet
offerings. They noted that since Internet functions are being
added to so many products, it is becoming more difficult to
distinguish between revenue from Internet and other offerings.

"I'd like anybody to be able to sit down and calculate Internet
revenue. Certainly I'd ask, along with that, about profit,"
said Bob McDowell, vice president for enterprise customers
at Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.

Informix's White did offer a bullish forecast, saying Internet
related revenue could increase from the single digits in 1995
to as much as 30 percent to 50 percent of revenue in 1996.

Mark Tebbe, president of Chicago-based Lante Corp., meanwhile,
predicted his Internet-related business will increase from
15 percent to 20 percent in 1995 to 33 percent in 1996.

Greg Jacobsen, executive vice president of outsourcing services
at Ottawa, Ontario-based SHL Systemhouse-which recently was
acquired by MCI Telecommunications Corp.-said his new parent
company is reaping rich rewards from the Internet by virtue
of its being a major provider of Internet access and bandwidth.
However, he did not provide specifics.

Although precise revenue data may be difficult to obtain, participants
agreed their customers will benefit handsomely from Internet
use.

The New Face Of Client/Server -- Channel conflict looms, but
so does opportunity

By:
Craig Zarley

New York-The accelerated pace of business process re-engineering
and the lack of qualified service people to meet the growing
opportunity emerged as dominant issues for both vendor and
channel executives attending the CRN Client/Server Summit.

"There is a giant gap between the [opportunity] for building
applications that are going to be mission-critical and having
people who are truly capable of designing and implementing
these systems," said Bob McDowell, Microsoft Corp.'s vice president
for enterprise customers.

Vendors and resellers are jockeying to find qualified service
people and form strategic alliances with each other to capitalize
on the burgeoning opportunity for services. So frenetic is
the pace of change, and so understaffed are both the channel
and vendors, that plugging this service gap will be the top
priority in the client/server arena for the coming year.

"Last year we went from 500 to almost 1,200 [employees], and
this year we'll add another 700 to 800," said Jim Sims, president
and chief executive of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.,
a Cambridge, Mass.-based systems integrator.

For their part, vendors, too, are focusing on the widening services
gap and are in the process of beefing up their own direct-service
offerings while trying to avoid conflicts with their channel
partners.

While the consensus among roundtable participants was that channel
vendor conflicts over services have been kept at a minimum,
all of that could change should client/server sales slow down.

"There is more demand than supply, so all ships rise with the
tide," said Ray Lane, Oracle Corp.'s president of worldwide
operations. "No one minds conflict in a market that is growing
as fast as this one is. If the market slows down, then you'll
see a much different attitude by vendors that want to build
a services business working with the systems integrator channel."

But of immediate concern to systems integrators is the potential
for vendors to make incursions into the channel's service domain.
Integrators maintain that conflicts will arise because vendors
advocate selling their specific products while integrators
sell complete solutions.

"You should choose how you're going to solve the problem, then
choose the appropriate technology," said Cambridge Technology's
Sims. "We come from the viewpoint that we're far more independent
to do that than a product company. But I think where you get
into conflict is when product companies try to get into that
space. There's conflict, and the more the product company gets
into that space, the less we want to work with that company."

But Oracle's Lane countered that market conditions may well
force resellers to more closely align themselves with specific
vendors.

"I believe it's going to be extremely difficult for a consulting
business in this kind of . . . market to remain an independent,
objective consultant," he said. Rather, Oracle's channel focus
in the near term will be on smaller integrators willing to
devote resources to the Oracle product line.

"I've got to take the conflict out, and I'd much prefer [to
work with] the largest integrators, and we could subcontract
a team to every one of them," Lane said. "But our consulting
business is big enough and they'd think twice about it, and
they want to control the customer. I prefer working with smaller
integrators that want to build a business out of Oracle."

Greg Jacobsen, executive vice president of SHL Systemhouse Inc.,
said the speed at which corporations are re-engineering their
business processes is forcing integrators to deploy packaged,
rather than customized, solutions. That phenomenon may, in
fact, force integrators to more closely align with specific
vendors.

"While we recognize the need to be able to continue to provide
custom solutions, we really think that the marketplace more
and more is getting away from that," he said. "They're going
to be very comfortable with a prepackaged model architecture
based on a selected set of partners where you can really add
the deepest value."

Microsoft, like Oracle, is building a consulting business, which
is expected to grow to about 1,000 consultants this year.

McDowell said Microsoft is aware it must move into service and
consulting to push products, while being careful not to create
conflict with the channel.

Valuation in excess of $400M; Nynex to sell stake -- Vanstar
IPO to chip away at $359M debt

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-Vanstar Corp.'s recently filed prospectus reveals a
highly leveraged corporate reseller that is seeking a premium
on Wall Street, compared with its major competitors, with a
valuation as high as $492 million.

As part of the offering, Nynex Worldwide Services Group Inc.
is selling off its 22 percent stake in the company-6.8 million
shares. The company is issuing 8 million shares to the public
with the goal of attracting as much as $12.50 a share. Most
of the $84.6 million in net proceeds that Vanstar hopes to
raise would be used to pay off debt.

Vanstar Chairman and Chief Executive William Tauscher does not
plan to sell any of his more than 2.2 million shares in the
company, making him an instant multimillionaire. However, Tauscher's
7.1 percent interest in the company will fall to 5.6 percent
following the offering. Warburg, Pincus Capital Co. L.P., Vanstar's
largest stockholder, plans to retain its nearly 14 million
shares and will remain the largest single shareholder, with
a 35.3 percent stake following the public offering.

After the IPO, Vanstar will have more than 39 million shares
outstanding, resulting in a market capitalization of between
$413 million and $492 million. That would be greater than the
market caps of CompuCom Systems Inc. ($349 million), Inacom
Corp. ($136 million) and MicroAge Inc. ($120 million), based
on last week's closing stock prices.

Analysts said those numbers make Vanstar appear relatively expensive,
especially given the company's balance sheet, which shows $10.7
million in cash on July 31, up from $7.8 million on April 30.
Inventories also rose over the same period to $325.4 million
from $298.7 million.

Vanstar lists $359.4 million in long-term debt, most of which
consists of $357.8 million in indebtedness to IBM Credit Corp.
Vanstar has a $425 million line of credit under a financing
agreement with ICC. Stockholders' equity is $25.7 million.

"The balance sheet is pretty weak. They are very leveraged,"
said Benny Lorenzo, portfolio manager at PAW Partners L.P.,
Greenwich, Conn. "They are pricing this towards the high end
of the comparable companies, and they would have to show any
potential investors why we should pay such a high value for
a new company when you can get an existing company for a cheaper
valuation."

Vanstar has spent much of the past several years in the red.

After its 1993 fiscal year, Vanstar changed its fiscal calendar
to end April 30 from ending Sept. 30. For the 1992 fiscal year,
ended Sept. 30, the company lost nearly $52 million, and in
1993, Vanstar lost an additional $4.2 million.

For the seven months ended April 30, 1994, the company recorded
a $45 million gain resulting in $44.5 million in net income,
but it still reported an operating loss. But for its most recent
fiscal year, ended April 30, Vanstar earned $1.3 million and
reported operating income of $26.8 million.

Sales during the past fiscal year reached $1.39 billion.

Vanstar does appear to have turned the corner recently, reporting
$427 million in sales and $3.5 million in net income for the
quarter ended July 31.

Lorenzo said one key message the company will have to get across
during its upcoming road show is future projections as services
become an integral part of the business.

In its July quarter, Vanstar's product sales accounted for 40
percent of overall operating revenue, while support services
represented nearly 38 percent. Networking sales accounted for
12.1 percent, while other services accounted for the remaining
9.8 percent.

Still, Vanstar hopes to transform into a more service-oriented
integration company and is going to experience growing pains
in that arena. Vanstar's support-services business posted a
$900,000 operating loss for the period, while product sales
resulted in an operating income of $8.3 million.

In addition, the prospectus shows Tauscher earned $550,008 plus
a $30,000 bonus for the 1995 fiscal year, ended April 30. Jay
Amato, Vanstar's president and chief operating officer, earned
$256,254 plus a $25,000 bonus.

The prospectus also provided insight into Vanstar's relationship
with Merisel Inc.'s FAB division, formed in January 1994 after
Vanstar sold ComputerLand Corp. to the distributor. The product
distribution agreement between the two companies, expiring
this month, called for Vanstar to keep one-half of its inventory
to maintain its obligations under the Merisel distribution
services agreement. Vanstar's assets include a $19.4 million
receivable from Merisel that matures this month, the prospectus
states.

Preferred allocation emerges as strategic weapon

By:
JACK SWEENEY

London-Priority allocation is emerging as the weapon of choice
among major PC vendors with IBM Corp. and Toshiba Corp. leading
the charge in the battle to enlist channel allies as part of
their aggressive global reselling programs.

During the past year, virtually all major PC vendors have launched
global reselling strategies to address the needs of large accounts
seeking a central point of PC procurement for their worldwide
operations. Missing from the equation, however, is preferred
allocation, a perk long enjoyed by corporations participating
in vendors' national large-account programs.

IBM and Toshiba are among the first to make preferred product
allocation a bona fide component of their global strategies,
and they are working with their resellers to reserve inventory
for specific global customers. "We have been working with the
management in each of our countries to help [accent] the needs
of global customers," said Neils Rokkebal, IBM Europe's chief
operating officer.

Close behind, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp.
now also are addressing customer allocation demands on a project
by-project basis. However, formalized global allocation programs
currently are under consideration by the two PC manufacturers,
reseller executives said.

"Global customers have made it clear to the manufacturers that
the failure of their subsidiaries to allocate needed product
has put the rollouts of global computer projects in jeopardy,"
said Anne Renders, director of marketing for International
Computer Group, a consortium of international dealers that
work together on global contracts.

"In the past, allocation had been fragmented for global customers,
and we're now eradicating that by recognizing them as truly
global accounts and rolling out a type of allocation red-carpet
treatment," said Chris Tripp, Toshiba's U.K. corporate accounts
sales manager and one of the architects of the vendor's newly
minted global allocation plan.

Accelerating the move toward global allocation strategies is
the fact that the large global accounts already receive priority
allocation for their U.S. operations.

"It's important to global clients that what they get in the
U.S. is similar to what they get outside the U.S.," said Jeffrey
Frankel, vice president of MicroAge Inc.'s international operations.

Steve Caskey, director of international sales for Inacom Corp.,
said priority supply has become a common request among Inacom's
global customers. "There is no question IBM and Toshiba, in
particular, are now responding to what our global customers
have been asking for," Caskey said.

By working closer with global customers and resellers, vendors
are hoping to curtail shortages through better product forecasting.

"When you get approached by a large customer with special needs
in terms of product and delivery expectation, you've got to
be able to feel fairly confident that you can meet those needs
to keep the customer happy," said David Howarth, international
marketing manager at Entex Information Services Inc., Rye Brook,
N.Y.

"We don't look at customers on a country-by-country basis. What
we do is look at the customers' overall requirements," said
Daniel Paul, a corporate accounts manager for HP's European
operation.

In Development: InfoPad -- Natioanl Dives Into Nework Computing

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Santa Clara, Calif.-National Semiconductor Corp. is entering
the network-computing-device race.

The chip maker is developing its own device, code-named InfoPad,
to pull information from an intelligent network, said Ellen
Hancock, the company's executive vice president and chief operating
officer.

The move is part of the company's push toward network-centric
computing, a computing model that will provide VARs with opportunities
to sell network-based solutions rather than plug-and-play boxes.
But the challenge to VARs will be integrating the network devices
with the appropriate network and database schemes.

The primary focus of a $6 million research and development laboratory
established last month by National is to develop new types
of semiconductors-including those with mixed-signal capabilities
to convert analog to digital communications-to support a network
device, Hancock said.

"The view that there's going to be much more use of intelligent
agent-type of technology is becoming much more interesting,"
Hancock said. "You'll see National focusing on the total system's
architecture, at least so it will do a better job of responding
to the parts of the architecture [for which] it's responsible."

Oracle Corp. and IBM Corp. have outlined plans to scale down
the PC's intelligence, memory and cost, as well as launch information
and software from the network. Both Oracle and IBM are working
on network computers priced in the $500 range.

National's plan is to create flexibility in its hardware and
semiconductor lines. Hancock said she is keen on offering devices
that come in different styles, levels of sophistication and
price points.

In addition, National is looking into partnerships with companies
that focus on storing and retrieving data from a network.

"We are getting more database-aware," Hancock said. "With everything
happening with the network, we have now engaged [in discussions]
with companies that deal with files, databases and object technology."

Digital to unveil faster Newton chip to power network computers
-- Vendor develops 100MHz, low-voltage processor for delivery
in February

By:
JEFF BLISS

Hudson, Mass.-Digital Equipment Corp. next month will unveil
a new version of Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton RISC processor,
which is eight times faster yet runs at less than half the
voltage of the current Newton chip.

The processor could play a pivotal role in the emerging $500
Internet computer market. Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores, Calif.,
is considering the new Digital StrongARM processor as the basis
for its $500 Internet device, sources said.

StrongARM, based on the Newton processor designed by Advance
RISC Machines Ltd., Cambridge, England, initially will run
as fast as 200MHz at 2 volts vs. the Newton chip, which currently
runs at 33MHz at 5 volts.

"[The StrongARM] has good power management on a screaming chip,"
said Tim Schmidt, a principal at Encore Consulting Group, Orlando,
Fla.

Digital, which licensed the Newton chip and is working with
Advance RISC Machines, also will introduce 100MHz and 160MHz
versions of the chip, with prices starting at $30 for shipments
of 10,000 per year for the 100MHz version.

Samples of the new StrongARM processor, the SA-110, will be
available in February, with volume shipments scheduled for
the spring.

The processor, which Digital will manufacture in its Hudson,
Mass., facility, could be key in making Internet devices a
reality and the Apple Computer Inc. Newton MessagePad-long
the target of criticism for poor performance-a success, analysts
said.

Jim Turley, senior editor at the Microprocessor Report, predicted
that Apple will use Digital's chips in its MessagePads by the
end of this year.

"The StrongARM will make the Newton a very useful item," Turley
said. He estimates the StrongARM is eight to 10 times faster
than the ARM 610 in current Newton models.

The new processor could give the Newton voice-recognition capabilities,
a source said. "People would be able to dictate a message that
they want to fax out," said one source familiar with Digital's
plans.

Officials at Oracle and Apple could not be reached for comment.

The source said the 100MHz version of the StrongARM will perform
at 115 million instructions per second at 1.5 volts. The 160MHz
chip will run at 185 MIPS at 1.5 volts, and the 200MHz processor
will run at 230 MIPS at 2 volts.

The chip also may prove attractive to the handheld and set-top
box market, analysts said.

One major obstacle Digital faces in making the chip a staple
in the Internet device market may be out of its control: the
lack of low-price network bandwidth to speed up browsing on
the Internet.

Other industry realities pose problems as well. "The handheld
market has been stymied by the lack of synergy between the
handheld systems and the desktop systems," said Andy Seybold,
editor-in-chief of Outlook on Communications and Computing.

The lukewarm response to ARM technology also is troublesome,
analysts said. Apple is the only major company that has bought
into the ARM technology, Schmidt said. "[Digital] has to make
sure that they have a buy-in from the other operating system
companies."

Pact Builds On Current Relationship -- Network Integrity, Entex
to partner on LANtegrity sales

By:
MONICA YOUNG

Marlborough, Mass.-Network Integrity Inc. is expected today
to disclose a reseller partnership agreement with Entex Information
Services Inc., Rye Brook, N.Y.

Under the terms of the agreement, Entex will resell and support
Network Integrity's LANtegrity for NetWare, which provides
instant recovery for failed servers. Entex also will preconfigure
customers' servers with the software to simplify the installation
process for the reseller.

"Entex is one of the largest national resellers of network services
with good technical abilities and configuration abilities,"
said John Butler, vice president of Network Integrity, based
in Marlborough.

Butler said this agreement is the result of Network Integrity's
satisfaction with its current relationship with Entex and a
desire to expand that partnership.

"Entex gets a product that opens the door to large accounts,"
Butler said, because LANtegrity is not intended for small businesses.
"It gives us sales and technical support in many cities," he
said.

"This product is one which you put in if a customer has many
servers. If [a customer] has hundreds of employees, it attracts
those large employers that Entex likes to add to their customer
base," Butler said.

With LANtegrity, Entex will be able to help customers reduce
network downtime and lost productivity and eliminate the need
for multiple servers at a single site, all of which would decrease
costs for their customers.

Brad Curtis, software business manager at Entex, said the reseller
will configure LANtegrity servers for customers at its ISO
9000 certified Integration and Distribution Center in Kentucky.

Curtis said that the partnership with Network Integrity allows
Entex to distribute the servers as turnkey solutions to its
customers. "Computer crashes are a fact of life," Curtis said.
"We're working to create a seamless delivery to customers,"
he said.

Several Entex customers-including AT&T Corp., NordicTrack Inc.
and Sherwin Williams Co.-now use LANtegrity.

LANtegrity is suited for large corporations since one LANtegrity
server can back up multiple servers, unlike other backup solutions
where a backup is necessary for each network server, Butler
said. When LANtegrity is used for a server cluster, if any
of the servers in the group fail, LANtegrity instantaneously
steps in, he said.

A LANtegrity server can support up to 1,000 users on multiple
NetWare servers and protects current and historical files within
15 seconds of failure. Butler said other backup products use
a "mirroring" method in which servers perform the same tasks
at the same time and only protect against hardware failures.
If the failure is in the software, the most current uncorrupted
files are not protected.

One LANtegrity server can back up from five to 10 servers, depending
on the number of supported users and activity level, Butler
said.

Initiatives: Improve reseller's communication and IT infrastructure
-- GTSI Turns Back To Young To Lead Turnaround Charge

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-Government Technology Services Inc.'s board is turning
back to Dendy Young to bail out the struggling reseller, naming
him president and chief executive less than 18 months after
he sold Falcon Microsystems Inc. to GTSI.

The move came as no surprise to those who follow the government
market. Experts said Young is the best choice to turn around
a company which, despite being in the best position in the
federal market, has struggled in its most recent quarters.

For its third quarter ended Sept. 30, 1995, the busiest buying
season in the federal market, GTSI's sales dropped 22 percent
to $175.7 million. Its net income plummeted over 70 percent,
to $1.7 million, compared to the same quarter a year before.

"He is the best-qualified person to bail-out the current GTSI
situation," said Thomas Hewitt, president of Federal Sources
Inc., McLean, Va. "It is fundamentally a good company, and
I think Dendy will be able to achieve the full potential of
that company. Everybody wins on this."

For his part, Young cautioned that the turnaround may take some
time, saying it could be two years before all his initiatives
take hold. The financial community, which has been hard on
the company of late, reacted well. GTSI's stock inched up 47
cents, to $4.13 per share, the day of the news and reached
$4.38 in the ensuing days.

Young said the two major long-term areas of focus for GTSI will
be on communication and the IT infrastructure.

On the communication side, Young said improvements must be made
with GTSI's customer base, the vendor community and the reseller's
own employees.

As for using new technology, Young said, "This business demands
we be efficient. We will be on the leading edge of the technology
curve."

In addition to hiring Young, GTSI also named Peter Janke executive
vice president. Prior to assuming their new positions, Janke
and Young were co-founders of The Exeter Group, which specialized
in strategic transition management for IT companies in the
Washington area.

Ingram shows multivendor service menus -- TSS pact gets jump
on distribution rivals

By:
JOHN LONGWELL

Santa Ana, Calif.-Ingram Micro Inc. is pulling the wraps off
its multivendor services offerings for VARs and dealers, staking
an early claim on what is expected to be a strategic battlefield
for distributors in the year ahead.

Working with third-party service organizations, Ingram quietly
has built its service program over the past year and now boasts
about 80 service SKUs in its Support Advantage arsenal.

Doug Antone, president of the Ingram Alliance and who recently
took charge of Ingram's value-added services, said the program
was designed to help VARs and independent dealers compete with
the full-service offerings of large corporate resellers.

"If we can partner with them, then we have a much better chance
of retaining their business," Antone said.

While corporate resellers look toward a big upside in services,
distributors also expect a piece of the action. Merisel Inc.,
El Segundo, Calif., and Tech Data Corp., Clearwater, Fla.,
have been negotiating with third-party services providers to
provide similar offerings.

Ingram, however, entered into an alliance with its primary service
provider, Technology Service Solutions, Wayne, Pa., a little
over a year ago.

Since then, Ingram has worked with TSS and some of its Premier
VARs on packaging multivendor services and bringing them into
two-tiered distribution, said Franz Roosen, senior manager
of field services for Ingram.

Service sales have begun to ramp exponentially in past months,
and now about 1,000 of the Premier VARs buy service through
Ingram, Roosen said.

Dan Wasser, vice president of marketing for National Guest Systems
Corp., Rockville, Md., which provides vertical solutions for
hotels and restaurants, said, "We've been looking for this
solution for a long time. I need firm [seven-day, 24-hour]
support because my clients are hotels. I need someone out there
to fix it if it breaks."

Wasser said because many of the accounts are small, one- and
two-site hotels, large providers do not contract directly for
the business.

Corporate Micro Systems Inc., Rolling Meadows, Ill., increased
service contracts from 15 to 50 since starting Ingram's program
six months ago. The company's costs are down, business is up,
and it has been able to go after national accounts for the
first time, said Sam Shaw, Corporate Micro's vice president.

Sneak Preview: Clear Process Clears Way For Automated Work Flow Analysis

By:
Eddie Correia

New York-Clear Software's Clear Process is a Windows-compatible
software tool that simplifies the complex task of analyzing
business procedures and finding ways to improve them. This
is accomplished by analyzing alternative workflow paths. Even
such sophisticated processes as manufacturing can be tamed
by Clear Process.

Engineers from the CRN Test Center found that the program creates,
with minimal effort, flow charts based on manual input or batch
import of text-based procedures. Once the work flow is built,
which can sometimes be done in minutes through the selection
of a menu choice, all possible work-flow paths are followed.

The critical paths and all others are identified, and corresponding
data are extracted and exported for analysis in a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet.

Resellers should like the product's automated features, which
include automatic geometry and arrow drawing for perfect alignment,
and automatically corrected printer page breaks and connectors.
These features assure that no process boxes are amputated by
the edge of a page.

The opportunity for resellers is to sell to auditors, production
managers, project managers, company controllers, and profit
and-loss analysts. Resellers with expertise in process automation
should have no difficulty becoming a consultant to issues in
that particular industrial-engineering discipline.

Clear Process tightly integrates the previously released allClear
III product into a complete process analysis solution. Clear
Software's allClear III offers the ability to create graphical
flowcharts from a company's existing set of ASCII text-based
procedures, dBASE files, Lotus 1-2-3 or Excel spreadsheets,
without having to rekey the data. It was a simple matter to
follow a simple set of punctuation rules; the charts flowed
forth like water.

Both text and chart are active and visible side by side; text
editing can be done from either side, and chart additions made
by using drag-and-drop templates.

Changes made to charts in the left-hand window are reflected
in the text in the right. Charts are automatically redrawn,
re-routed and re-sized after each edit, and page connectors
are drawn automatically. This module also offers self-documentation,
diagram rotation, support for multiple open diagrams, advanced
editing features, a runtime viewer and network support; also,
it is an OLE server.

The Clear Process interface is based on a straightforward, five
step procedure for the entire process. Standout analysis tools
include the abilities to identify the critical and optimal
paths of a process; to analyze alternatives easily; to assign
probabilities to workflow paths based on company statistics
or other probability data; and to perform and see animated
"what-if" scenarios based on factors such as time and cost.
The product also offers the ability to rapidly create workflow
prototypes with instant feedback and presentation graphics.

Examination of the product, done in the confines of the CRN
Test Center on a Pentium-based PC, yielded snappy performance.
Clear Process, however, is perfectly at home on a 486-based
unit. System requirements include 8 Mbytes of available RAM
and 8 Mbytes of hard-drive space.

IBM seeks to raise up to $1.75B in cash

By:
BARBARA DARROW & STEVEN BURKE

Boston-IBM Corp. is looking to raise $1.75- billion in cold,
hard cash, according to recent filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

In an S-3 document filed just before Christmas, IBM registered
to issue up that amount of stock, debt or warrants. That, in
addition to the nearly $7 billion IBM already has in its coffer,
comprises a prodigious war chest for future acquisitions or
to solidify the computer giant's balance sheet.

Even without this newest infusion, analysts said IBM easily
could do a long-rumored deal to buy Novell Inc. or even Apple
Computer Inc.

When IBM completed its $3.52 billion buyout of Lotus Development
Corp. last June, then-Chief Financial Officer Jerome York maintained
that this was not the "King Kong" acquisition IBM hinted at
earlier.

Some were puzzled by the filing. "Why do they need all that
money? They already have $7 billion left after the Lotus deal.
Novell? Pocket change-especially after jettisoning WordPerfect,"
said Karl Wong a Santa Clara, Calif.-based consultant, noting
IBM might be shooting for a telecommunications company. "They
always wanted to be a service company," he said.

Others said IBM is more likely to initiate a stock buyback or
otherwise firm up its bottom line than gird for another shopping
spree. "I think, if anything, they want to help their balance
sheet," said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y., consultant.

VARs agreed IBM must stay true to its network focus. A smaller
networking acquisition is more likely than a big Novell or
Apple deal, said Mike Conroy, technical director at Island
Computer Products, New York.

Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of IBM's new Internet
Division, said an Internet or network-centric acquisition was
possible. "If it is necessary and looks right, we may form
a stronger alliance or may do some investment, including perhaps
outright buying something," he said.

Quarterdeck leads industry stocks with 800% rise in '95 -- Spyglass,
U.S. Robotics round out top three issues

By:
EDWARD F. MOLTZEN

New York-Things were looking bleak at Quarterdeck Corp. early
last year, with a share price that was near an all-time low
and dropping, and a market that seemed to be passing it by.

Then the company's new chief executive, Gaston Bastiaens, hitched
Quarterdeck's wagon to the Internet. The biggest comeback of
the year followed.

Out of almost 100 high-tech stocks tracked by Computer Reseller
News throughout the year-a year in which high-tech companies
fueled the biggest bull run in Wall Street history-Quarterdeck
shares increased in value the most.

At the opening bell of 1995, Quarterdeck shares were trading
at $3.13. By the close of business Dec. 28, the company's shares
were at $28.13-an increase of about 800 percent on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.

During the year, Santa Monica, Calif.-based Quarterdeck went
from a company that produced mainly utility software to one
that unveiled a line of World Wide Web products such as browsers
and servers, in addition to RAM-maximizing software that became
popular when Microsoft Corp. began selling Windows 95.

After Quarterdeck, the four other high-tech stocks to post the
largest increases in value this past year included Spyglass
Inc., Naperville, Ill., which went public on June 27 and closed
that day at $13.56 per share, and finished the Dec. 28 trading
day at $56.50, a gain of 317 percent; modem maker U.S. Robotics
Corp., Skokie, Ill., which started the year with its shares
going for $21.63, but which climbed to $85.75, a gain of nearly
300 percent; Macromedia Inc., San Francisco, whose stock went
to $51 from $12.75, growth of 300 percent; and United Stationers
Inc., formerly known as Micro United, whose shares grew in
price to $26.63 from $6.63, a gain of 302 percent.

But not all high-tech companies were able to rejoice in the
1995 technology bull run on Wall Street.

Radius Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., a maker of PC monitors and peripherals,
saw its share price tumble to a meager $2 from $8.50 on the
Nasdaq-a drop of 76 percent during the year. That made it the
worst performing stock followed by CRN.

Following Radius, AmeriQuest Technologies Inc., an Irvine, Calif.
based distributor holding company that underwent change in
its executive ranks and organization during 1995, was hit the
hardest, with shares dropping by about 71 percent to less than
$1.00 from $3.25.

Corporate reseller Dataflex Corp., Edison, N.J., saw its shares
trail off by about 63 percent to $3.25 from $8.88, while Government
Technology Services Inc., a Chantilly, Va.-based government
reseller, witnessed its stock plummet to $4.32 from $10.75,
a drop of 60 percent.

Rounding out the worst five performers is software developer
Gupta Corp., Menlo Park., Calif., which dropped to $5.25 from
$11.25 per share, a falloff of about 53 percent year-over-year.

Apple's Plan: Pippin information appliance -- Macworld To Focus
On Riding Net Wave, Copland

By:
DIANA HWANG & MICHAEL KANNELLOS

Boston-The Macworld trade show in San Francisco next week will
kick off the new year as vendors, including Apple Computer
Inc. and other third parties, display resources for riding
the Internet wave and for supporting Apple's future Copland
operating system.

Apple is positioning its forthcoming Pippin low-cost device
as an "information appliance" functioning as an Internet browser,
said David Nagel, senior vice president of worldwide research
and development at Apple, Cupertino, Calif. The Pippin operating
system is a derivative of the existing Macintosh operating
system, he said.

Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., however, is positioning Office
for the Macintosh as a front end to the Web. Microsoft will
show a companion product to its Internet Explorer browser that
will be familiar to Office 95 users, said Product Manager Dave
Meltzer.

Third-party vendor DeltaPoint Inc., Monterey, Calif., will push
the Internet in its product lineup with the launch of WebVision
Animator, a multimedia authoring tool for animating Web pages
and other multimedia presentations. The product consists of
two components: the multimedia authoring tool and a Netscape
Navigator plug-in for viewing purposes. The plug-in also provides
the ability to see animations without needing to run WebVision
Animator.

Expected for release this half of the year, the $295 product
creates animation and distributes it via the Internet and other
channels. DeltaPoint will further expand the WebVision product
line later this month.

Now Software Inc., Portland, Ore., will unveil support for OpenDoc
and Copland for its flagship line of software Now Utilities,
said Henry Carstens, business development manager. At the show,
the company will unveil shipment plans of Now Synchronize version
2.0, an updated release that includes support for AppleTalk
and Newton 2.0. List price for Now Synchronize 2.0 is $29.95.

Apple recently shipped 50 copies of a release of Copland to
select developers, Nagel said.

On the PDA front, Digital Ocean, Lenexa, Kan., will unveil Seahorse,
a ruggedized PDA based on the new Newton 2.0 operating system.
The handheld is aimed at applications such as wireless Internet
access to global-positioning-system uses. Without communications
options, the product lists for under $1,500; inclusion of a
modem or module options costs under $2,000. Seahorse, with
cellular digital packet data capabilities, will be released
next quarter.

On the multimedia side, MetaTools Inc., Carpenteria, Calif.,
will unveil KPT Power Photos 3 and support for a new API in
Adobe Illustrator 6.0 for Macintosh, and demonstrate its new
KPT 3 application.

Cable vs. Telecommunications Companies -- TCI to roll out flat
rate, high-speed Net access

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Englewood, Colo. -Cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is taking
on the telecommunications industry with an aggressive rollout
this week of high-speed access to the Internet at a flat rate
of $29.95 per month.

Resellers welcome infrastructures that increase bandwidth to
the Internet-in this case by as much as 1,000 times the speed
of a 9600-baud modem-but remain skeptical over the guarantee
of quality service provided by an industry not known for superior
customer support.

"The reputation for service between cable and phone companies
is much different," said Tom Henderson, vice president of engineering
for Unitel Inc., Indianapolis. "Phone companies are used to
having no excuse for downtime. VARs don't typically touch the
consumer marketplace, but we're watching it closely to see
if the cable companies will provide adequate service to the
commercial entities, which is where we live."

In addition to Internet access, TCI, based in Englewood, will
provide links to the Microsoft Network, America Online Inc.
and CompuServe Inc. for additional fees, company officials
said.

TCI, whose cable infrastructure currently spans 25 percent of
the country, expects to have the online service available to
all its subscribers by 1997, said Brian Hayashi, creative director
of TCI's interactive media group, a subsidiary of the Technology
Ventures Group.

The cable titan has set its sights on becoming a major player
in the online and Internet arenas after a spending spree by
Technology Ventures Group of over $300 million, invested in
ventures with the computer community. These included $125 million
on Microsoft Corp.'s online services. It also has invested
in Netscape Communications Corp. and @Home Network.

Still, wrinkles will likely need smoothing as the new service
unfolds. For example, the 10-Mbps access to the home TCI promises
sounds like an enormous pipe, but it is shared access. It grows
much smaller if many other users are accessing the Internet
at the same time, VARs said.

VARs also expressed concern over selling competing services.

IBM, Ameritech service partnership could bolster vendor's channel
ties

By:
KEVIN MERRILL

New York-IBM Corp.'s new service alliance with Ameritech Corp.
is expected to become an early testing ground for the vendor's
strategy to ease conflicts with the channel in the service
arena.

IBM's Integrated Systems Solutions Corp. (ISSC) and Ameritech
inked a pact last month to manage and integrate PC, fax and
phone services. The companies also will rely on each other
for internal desktop and voice-management services in a shared
outsourcing deal valued at an estimated $400 million over seven
years.

The alliance is expected to generate returns for the channel
starting this month, as Ameritech begins transferring more
work to ISSC and as ISSC, in turn, begins subcontracting work
to VARs.

Omaha, Neb.-based Inacom Corp. has been providing product fulfillment
and configuration services to Ameritech on behalf of ISSC,
which already had a working relationship with Ameritech. Ameritech
officials said the ISSC-Inacom fulfillment deal replaces an
almost identical one with The Future Now Inc., an Intelligent
Electronics Inc. subsidiary.

ISSC and IE officials were unavailable for comment.

Desktop services covered by the alliance include telephones,
printers, PCs, software, wiring, LANs, services, videoconferencing
equipment, fax equipment, voice mail, paging, wireless equipment,
and technical and consulting support.

Ameritech has used ISSC internally the past year for some desktop
management services. The work has been limited to the network
services unit, one of about a dozen business units within Ameritech.

ISSC has subcontracted with Inacom to provide PC ordering and
configuration, but not advanced services such as help desk
or network management. Those additional services are covered
by the new agreement between ISSC and Ameritech.

Mike Steffan, president of Inacom's reseller and distribution
divisions, said the fulfillment and configuration work started
in earnest this past spring.

Inacom, IE and other resellers have embraced and invested in
voice-data convergence in recent years to keep affiliates in
step with the market and computer telephony opportunities in
general.

"I think IBM is anxious to get into desktop management in a
big way," said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant.
"I think this is something that both companies need."

Proxy reveals former AST execs' compensation deals

By:
EDWARD F. MOLTZEN

New York-AST Research Inc. made about $3 million in lump-sum
payments to executives to whom it showed the door last year,
with its former president reaping the most, according to a
proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Jim Schraith, the company's former president, was paid a lump
sum of $1.5-million after leaving the company, in connection
with his employment agreement, AST disclosed.

Scott Smith, AST's vice president and general manager of desktop
products, was paid $477,500. James Wittry, who left the company
as senior vice president of the Americas, was paid $461,600.
And Richard Ottaviano, senior vice president of administration,
was paid $720,100 to leave the company.

The exodus of top executives at AST climaxed with the Nov. 2,
1995, hiring of former Apple Computer Inc. executive Ian Diery
to be the Irvine, Calif.-based PC maker's chief executive.

AST will pay Diery a base salary of $700,000 per year, plus
stock options worth at least $10 million over the next seven
years.

Should AST's share price rise to $40 in the next nine months
a long shot with the company's stock now trading at about $8.50
per share-Diery would reap $40-million.

From Diery's hiring to mid-December, AST's share price dropped
from $9.38, even as South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Corp.
continued on its track to take over majority ownership of the
company and provide AST with much needed financing.

Last month, Samsung signed another deal with AST to offer a
bank line or line of credit of up to $200 million through Dec.
31, 1997, and a vendor line of credit from Samsung to AST of
$100 million through Nov. 30, 1997, for purchases of components.

In exchange, AST will give Samsung an option to buy 4.4 million
additional shares of the company at an exercise price of 1
cent per share, which can be exercised after June 30, 1996.
The option expires on June 30, 2001.

According to the company, a $100 investment in AST stock on
June 30, 1990, was worth $130 on July 1, 1995.

In addition to the options, AST gave Diery a "relocation allowance"
of $500,000 for moving expenses.

Qureshey Stays On

The company also revealed in its proxy statement that AST co
founder Safi Qureshey, who stepped aside as chief executive
to make room for Diery, is staying on as an employee and chairman
of the board at AST-but not without a personal cost.

The company said Qureshey agreed to cut his $650,000 annual
salary to $325,000 "until the company returns to profitability."

The company also said Qureshey "agreed not to currently enforce
the terms of the existing [employment] agreement with respect
to termination for 'good reason.' "

However, if new corporate leadership from Samsung decides to
fire Qureshey without cause, Qureshey would be eligible for
a "golden parachute" severance clause of approximately $2 million.

The executive shuffling at AST came while the company continued
experiencing losses. Analysts generally applauded the moves,
especially the hiring of Diery.

FTC probes need for antitrust-enforcement changes

By:
DARRYL K. TAFT

Washington-The Software Publishers Association is calling for
stricter antitrust scrutiny in the computer software industry.

In recent testimony before the Federal Trade Commission, the
SPA called for greater antitrust enforcement for the kinds
of practices that competitors have claimed against Microsoft
Corp.

The SPA conducted a survey of its membership, which includes
companies such as Microsoft, Borland International Inc., Novell
Inc., Symantec Corp., IBM Corp., Netscape Communications Inc.,
America Online Inc. and CompuServe Inc.

The survey results "suggest our membership supports a continued
and indeed in some respects heightened-government antitrust
enforcement presence in the software industry," said Ken Wasch,
president of the SPA.

The FTC held a series of hearings, which ended late last month,
on competitiveness in the IT industry. Though the hearings
have ended, the record remains open until the end of January
for additional comments.

Also, though the FTC is not involved in the ongoing U.S. Department
of Justice investigation of Microsoft, the agency is expected
to share its findings with the Justice Department, sources
said.

Among the organizations that testified before the FTC were the
SPA, Borland, Sun Microsystems Inc., IBM, the Computer and
Communications Industry Association and the Alliance to Promote
Software Innovation (APSI)

The SPA hired Public Opinion Strategies, Alexandria, Va., to
draft the 13 questions for the survey and send them to its
membership. Sources said Microsoft, which sits on the SPA board,
did not agree with some of the questions and that 11 of the
13 questions were changed at least once to accommodate Microsoft.
Microsoft could not be reached for comment.

Most survey respondents said they see greater anticompetitive
practices in the industry compared to 10 years ago. Eight in
10 respondents said "concerns about unlawful, anticompetitive,
or monopolistic activity in the software industry are greater
than they were 10 years ago." However, smaller firms-with revenue
under $10 million a year-said they see greater anticompetitive
activity than do larger firms: 82 percent vs. 71 percent.

"Over-concentration of market power in the hands of one company"
was the top item, mentioned by 56 percent of respondents. In
second place was "control of a computing platform with dominant
market share," with 29 percent of the mentions.

Also, most respondents said they see the emergence of dominant
players as increasing entry barriers for new companies; are
concerned that a company with dominance in computing platforms
may parlay that dominance to control other segments of the
market; and also believe the emergence of a dominant software
company would make it more difficult to introduce new and innovative
products and to allow other companies to compete on a fair
and even basis.

Three quarters of the SPA members that responded to the survey
said "the emergence of dominant players in key segments of
the software industry increases barriers to entry for new software
companies."

For The Record: The Books Are Finally Open

By:
Robert Faletra

For as long as I've been covering the channel, everyone has
been dying to see some real numbers on two companies, Chip
Lacy's Ingram Micro and Bill Tauscher's Vanstar.

In the next few months, both of those wishes will come true
as the two companies make public offerings.

Vanstar's filing with the SEC is on the street now showing some
interesting tidbits.

While Ingram's filing is still a few weeks off, one thing that
the Vanstar and Ingram offering once again will prove is that
the channel's margins are razor thin. This is another reason
why I'm always shaking my head when manufacturers decide that
the best way to get to market is via a direct approach when
the channel is so efficient.

But let's take a look at the Vanstar offering: Nynex, which
owns 6.7 million shares as a result of selling the Nynex Business
Centers to Vanstar several years ago, is selling all of its
shares in the company. If the estimated $12.50 offering holds,
the telephone company stands to walk away with $84.6 million.

Tauscher, the sixth-largest shareholder, will hold nearly $28
million in Vanstar stock (at least on paper) after the public
offering if the $12.50 per share holds.

Interestingly, Nynex is the only major stockholder cashing out.

According to the initial public offering documents, the company
plans to use the proceeds from the offering for one purpose
reducing debt. That includes payment of a $2.4 million note
owed to Nynex .

Vanstar holds a $425 million line of credit with IBM Credit
Corp. Vanstar intends to use proceeds of the offering to repay
amounts outstanding under the ICC financing program agreement.
That agreement, according to the papers, is used to finance
working capital, approximately $358 million of which was outstanding
as of July 31, 1995.

The filing points out that Vanstar has a "Limited History of
Profitability," experiencing losses in fiscal years 1991, 1992
and 1993, as well as during the seven months ending April 30,
1994.

The papers also show, however, that Vanstar recently increased
its business focus on network services and expects to increase
its percentage of operating income from its service business.

That's where the potential investor gain lies and why Vanstar
might just be a good bet for the future despite its past problems.

Plugged In: Wait, Lotus Notes Has A Competitor?

By:
Mark Cuban

OK, it's time for Mark to put an end to some unbelievable stupidity
in the marketplace.

The Web is not a competitor to Lotus Notes. It may be at some
point in the future, depending on what Netscape does with Collabra
Share, but as of today, there is nothing about the Web that
can compete with Notes.

Before I explain, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that
the Web owes its very existence to Lotus Notes. How? Very simple.
If Jim Manzi had any marketing skills whatsoever, there would
be no Web. Instead, we would have a global Notes network. It's
a shame Manzi never worked for Microsoft or even for Netscape,
had it existed. He would have learned about building markets
and pre-empting competitors. (The punchline is if Lotus had
been selling Windows, it would cost $795 per copy, until IBM
bought it. . . . But I digress.)

Why is the Web not a competitor to Notes? Take the test. With
Notes I can replicate to my PC any data I have access to. Now
try this at home. Go to any Web page, try to download it, then
look at it on your PC and use it. It's impossible without going
through each document and individually downloading the graphics
and redefining the links. Now just think, you want to download
the sales plan. . . . Yeah, right.

Next, try creating a threaded discussion database on the Web.
Sure, you could use IRC Chat, but without threads. Sure, you
could create a List Serv that could be threaded, but how do
you distribute it?

Next try this: Distribute information among multiple Web servers
and synchronize it. It isn't going to be pretty, if it happens
at all.

All of these people out there who say the Web is a competitor
to Notes probably have not used either. Notes has been misunderstood
by the press. Exchange, Perfect Office and all these Notes
wanna-be's never have amounted to anything more than giveaway
mail clients that the press has declared Notes competitors.

This is not to say that IBM doesn't have challenges with Notes.
It definitely does. They have made a smart move in reducing
the price of the Notes client. They probably should do everything
possible to have it bundled with every business computer sold,
even if it means paying the Compaqs and HPs of the world to
put it on their computers. They probably should do everything
possible to create "Notes-Enabled" Web sites or "Powered-by
Notes" Web sites that highlight the capabilities Notes has
to publish data on the Web, even if it means seeding leading
sites with free software.

So IBM, contrary to what they think, you are still in the driver's
seat. And you are in a race-but at least it's a race you still
can win.

Tell me what you think. E-mail me at mcuban@audionet.com.

MARK CUBAN is president of AudioNet (www.audionet.com), the
largest audio site on the Internet and an Internet Systems
Integration Company.

Letters to the Editor: AT&T comments on Notes and Group Wise



To The Editor:

We would like to comment on your Dec. 11 article regarding AT&T
Corp.'s NetWare Connect Services and Network Notes.

AT&T remains committed to AT&T Network Notes. While we look
to the market to determine applications, our commitment to
AT&T Network Notes and its customers remains firm. AT&T has
not announced any plans to offer GroupWise XTD on its collaborative
messaging platform or on AT&T NetWare Connect Service (ANCS)

The article implies AT&T is setting up a rivalry between AT&T
Network Notes and a planned competitive GroupWise XTD service.
We are not planning a rivalry. That's not our role. The ANCS
platform will provide easy access to many applications in the
future.

AT&T has no plans to "fold both of the services (AT&T Network
Notes and AT&T NetWare Connect Service) together into one infrastructure,"
as your article stated. AT&T NetWare Connect Service will provide
one type of access to AT&T Network Notes. The two will remain
as separate services that leverage each other's technical advantages.

The quote from Rose Klimovich, AT&T ANCS product line director,
was taken out of context. The article quoted Rose stating that
"Network Notes will 'partially share' the same infrastructure
and that users could access Network Notes through ANCS." Again,
ANCS will provide access to AT&T Network Notes.

Gary Hickox, VP,

AT&T Collaboration & Imaging Services

Erik Grimmelman, VP,

AT&T NetWare Connect Service

Editor's Note: CRN stands behind its story, which reported that
AT&T and Novell plan to offer an alternative to AT&T Network
Notes in the form of a version of GroupWise XTD running on
AT&T NetWare Connect Services.

To The Editor:

Your article in the Dec. 11 issue ("The Biggest Stories of 1995")
is far-fetched, and too general.

 "NT's rampage caused Novell to regroup, . . . "

What rampage? Novell, for fiscal year 1995, shipped more NetWare
than at any other time in our history. Our company revenue
grew based primarily on the strength of NetWare 4.1. We shipped
more than 700,000 NetWare server licenses in fiscal year '95,
and NetWare 4.1 accounted for 40 [percent] of those shipments,
driving a year-over-year increase in [NetWare] 4.1 server license
sales of more than 300 [percent] and sales of upgrades to [NetWare]
4.1 from previous versions of NetWare grew nearly 400 [percent]

[Robert] Frankenberg's message since taking [the] helm has been,
and continues to be, "Novell is the leading network software
provider. Novell software provides the infrastructure for a
networked world, enabling our customers to connect with other
people and the information they need, anytime and anyplace."

Novell is a networking company. The Applications Division did
not make sense in this core strategy, though Novell will support
and have an interest in the new owners of the Apps Division.
Remember, the purchase of [WordPerfect] happened before Frankenberg
assumed control.

As for our influence, we are king. We are open to standards
and to working with as many companies as we can so that we
can network the world. Do the companies Oracle, Apple, AT&T,
IBM, SCO, Hewlett-Packard [and] Intel ring a bell? The noninfluence
comes from the press, [which insists] on following the clouded
and ever-diverse strategy of Microsoft. What is their strategy
 . . . desktop, applications, Internet, satellites, Mac, Windows?
If the press would educate themselves with Novell, put our
strategy and our products to test vs. [Microsoft's], someone
could be a hero.

Kenny Mills

Regional Marketing Manager

Rocky Mountain

Novell Inc.

To The Editor:

I enjoyed your article in the Computer Reseller News, about
"what would make Comdex better?" (CRN, Nov. 27, 1995)

I had one additional idea, but first I wanted to disclose that
I am tied to this industry that I thought had a better idea.

Upstairs in the Sands, there was a group of vendors all providing
voice recognition systems all together in one area. I found
that an excellent idea to provide head-to-head competition
between vendors. This allows the person attending to get a
quick comparison of vendors of a particular technology.

I would enjoy seeing more of this type of cooperation between
opposing vendors in setting up their booths within the same
area to provide "comparison shopping."

Again, I am a vendor for voice recognition products, so this
is in effect a slap on our own backs.

This fits in with your own ideas/problems, where it is incredibly
difficult to find a particular booth, or to ensure that you
hit all of the vendors you wish to see.

Random Access: Client/Server's Big Opportunity

By:
Robert C. DeMarzo

There is a certain air that only people in the client/server
community possess. An air of confidence. They walk with a certain
attitude. They fly at a different altitude than the rest of
the market, see through issues that most take for granted or
cannot comprehend. Their adeptness at complex technical issues
and entrenchment in databases, Unix and enterprise networks
have always set this group apart.

This year's annual CRN Client/Server Roundtable, bringing together
the best and brightest in the client/server world, once again
gives our readers the inside edge on the hottest and most exciting
market.

Client/server computing has grown up more than any of us could
imagine. It has taken a quantum leap in only the last 12 months.
Much of this has been driven by the Internet, the rise of service
and support, shorter business process re-engineering cycles
and the promise of Windows NT. Supporting all this is the appearance
of shrink-wrap-like client/server applications, such as a sales
force automation package that runs on top of Oracle, Informix
or Sybase databases. Any reseller out there that does not know
those companies better get with the program.

No longer is anyone consumed with finding some all-encompassing
definition of client/server computing. It simply exists and
has manifested itself in just about every large corporation
in the United States and growing numbers of small and medium
size businesses, as well.

The first part of the CRN Client/Server Roundtable appears in
this week's issue beginning on page 1 with the news stories
and a transcript of what the executives had to say about business
opportunities on the Internet. The client/server bunch is salivating
over the sudden rise of the Internet. They've got the powerful
databases, the tools, the services, the expertise and the ability
to get businesses up and running on the Net. But they believe
the real money to be made today lies in the Intranet, corporate
networks with gateways and access to the Net. Informix Chairman
Phil White states rather plainly, "The biggest market for all
of this is going to be inside companies. They're spending the
money, they've got the need for sales-force automation, customer
service, customer support. That's going to drive a lot of business
big time in '96 and '97."

Resellers looking for business and service models to emulate
would be wise to listen to the players at this year's Client
Server Roundtable. This is where the rubber meets the road,
where resellers are evaluating, quickly delivering business
solutions and recommending products that bring competitive
advantages. This is where the VAR/systems integrator model
has evolved into its most powerful, influential and customer
driven form.

The Industry Speaks Out



"A rental model is not attractive to most corporations."

- Bill Gates, Microsoft Corp. chief executive, on the viability
of downloading and using applets off the Internet.

"The only [positive sales] effect the Internet is having now
is in modems. People are buying [upgrades] every six months."

- Ken Krich, ComputerWare Inc. president, on the Internet.

"I'm not so quick to [predict the] demise [of] Notes.

We have customers who are still deploying Notes . . . who are
not ready to trash what they started and move to the Internet."

- Mark Tebbe, Lante Corp. president

"The best way to offer replication capabilities over the Internet,
which I absolutely agree is a critical function, is to integrate
Notes with the Internet, which we are doing."

- Irving Wladawsky-Berger, head of IBM Corp.'s Internet Division,
on whether IBM would break out the replication capability from
Notes and provide it for the Internet.

Data General boosts reseller efforts for midrange units

By:
JEANETTE BROWN

Westboro, Mass.-Data General Corp. is renewing its focus on
VARs and ISVs by "getting back to its roots, or core strengths,
which have always been in midrange to high-end RISC systems
and the channel," said John Anderson, vice president of Data
General's U.S. Channels Division. "The company was founded
on OEM and channel relationships."

To that end, the Westboro-based company recently restructured
its channel organization under Anderson and boosted reseller
support in several areas.

Data General also is in the throes of a major product transition,
pitching its new Intel-based servers to resellers.

Last quarter, Data General expanded its AViiON family of Unix
based systems with Pentium-based models that run either the
Data General/UX enterprise operating system or Windows NT Server.
They support 15,000 existing AViiON applications, according
to the company.

But the channel is at the core of its aim at the midrange market.
"We're putting a lot more resources and investment into partnerships,"
Anderson said. "Clearly, we have a support problem. We're aggressively
trying to educate our partners."

The company is launching efforts to smooth things over with
resellers, he said. For one, it added more account managers
to enable the company to better understand the resellers' business
and how they integrate its products and services, he added.

Each account manager oversees between two and four accounts,
unlike previously, when they managed about 25 each, Anderson
said. A dedicated technical support manager will oversee resellers'
presales and technical support.

Data General also placed people within its distributors-Gates
FA Distributing Inc. and Western Micro Technology Inc.-to oversee
the Data General line. The company expects to add a third distributor
in the next six months.

In other areas, Data General revamped its reseller contract,
reducing the number of product categories and the dollar value
levels resellers must commit to purchase. Other efforts include
lead generation and consultation on the use of co-op dollars.

"We've allocated a pool of equipment and technical people to
help move products over," he said. "All the major database
products are running on our platform. That's key to getting
channel partners to move over."

Data General wants to focus on training more, as well, Anderson
said. Free seminars will be offered to partners each quarter.
"If we bring the level of expertise up in the VAR community,
it'll help alleviate the support problem," he said.

And to make it easier for resellers to do business with Data
General, the company is beta-testing a configuration and order
entry software product called Trilogy that it expects to roll
out to the channel by April.

While the ratio of direct vs. channel sales fluctuates now between
70-30 and 60-40, Data General hopes to move as much as 55 percent
through the channel in the next year, Anderson said.

Some Data General partners, while acknowledging that the company
may gain more support with its Intel-based line, said Data
General may lose what distinguishes it from the rest of the
pack.

"I'm wondering whether it will cause a glitch for them," said
Leonard LaFrance, executive vice president of ISV Century Analysis
Inc., Pacheco, Calif. "Does it become a commodity because it's
Intel?"

Platinum teams with Digital, Wyle

By:
JOHN LONGWELL

Irvine, Calif.-Platinum Software Corp. is turning to the hardware
distribution channel to reach more VARs with its SQL NT financial
accounting package.

The Irvine, Calif.-based software vendor entered into a joint
marketing agreement with Digital Equipment Corp. and one of
its distributors, Wyle Electronics Inc., to deliver accounting
solutions on the Alpha NT platform to VARs.

Platinum, which dropped an unsuccessful direct-sales effort
in October, has been building a VAR channel for its midrange
SQL accounting package over the past year and said it now has
about 70 VARs.

Under the marketing agreement, Wyle, Irvine, will be providing
Platinum's VARs moving to the Alpha NT platform with market
development funds, technical support, and hardware installation
and fulfillment services. Wyle will not be providing fulfillment
for Platinum software, however.

"What's great about Wyle is they're really making it a plug
and play for our VARs, so even if our VARs haven't traditionally
been involved in selling hardware, they're making it easy for
them to get involved with Alpha equipment," said Kevin Regelsberg,
vice president of sales, Platinum.

Regelsberg said Platinum is marketing its product to Wyle's
VARs, while Wyle expects to pick up customers among Platinum's
VARs. VARs that sign up with Wyle will get $1,500 in marketing
funds to jump-start their efforts, he said.

Digital and Platinum plan to kick off a 20-city tour in February
to promote the Alpha NT and Platinum SQL NT solution to end
users and generate leads for VARs, said Lynn Annecston, business
manager for Digital's Software Partners Group.

Annecston said Digital has worked with Platinum since last spring
and has 18 to 20 North American reference sites.

Fore, Alantec to merge; may boost migration to ATM

By:
Monica Young

Pittsburgh -Fore Systems Inc. and Alantec Corp. said they intend
to merge the two companies to accelerate migration from LAN
to asynchronous-transfer-mode (ATM) networks.

Under terms of the deal, each of 12 million outstanding shares
of Alantec stock will be converted to one share of Fore stock,
and Alantec will become a wholly owned LAN-switching subsidiary
of Fore.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, Fore's revenue was
$75.6 million. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Alantec's
revenue was $25.8 million.

Alantec, San Jose, Calif., granted Fore an option to purchase
up to 12 percent of its outstanding shares. George Archuleta,
chairman and chief executive of Alantec, will become a member
of Fore's board of directors once the merger is completed.
Eric Cooper will remain chairman and chief executive of Fore.

Fore acquired Applied Network Technology Inc. in May, which
was the first time Fore became involved in indirect-sales channels.
According to a Fore spokesperson, the company's distribution
models are complementary and no changes are expected in Alantec's
reseller channels.

"I would expect Fore to take advantage of Alantec's high-end
resellers," said Steve Munroe, president of Triumph Technologies
Inc., a Burlington, Mass.-based Alantec integrator. He said
most of Alantec's high-end channel partners have the skill
set to sell Fore's ATM line, so Alantec's channels would be
a good match for Fore.

Munroe said the merger will not likely accelerate ATM migration
for customers that are otherwise not ready to make that leap;
however, it simplifies the process for resellers because they
now can work with a single vendor.

In addition, he said Alantec's ATM migration strategy was based
on Fore's ATM products. "This is a good growth strategy for
Alantec's customers," Munroe said.

Maylex Prepares To Buy BusLogic

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-Mylex Corp. said it has agreed to acquire BusLogic
Inc., a privately held company, in a stock deal worth about
$50 million.

Santa Clara, Calif.-based BusLogic is a supplier of high-performance
SCSI I/O solutions used in network file servers, personal computers
and workstations.

The deal is expected to be completed this month. Once it is
completed, BusLogic said it will continue to operate under
its name and at its present locations as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Fremont, Calif.-based Mylex.

Access To New Technologies

Al Montross, the president of Mylex, said the deal will enable
both companies to access new technologies and capabilities,
to extend market reach and to better capitalize on the strong
growth forecasted for the RAID and controller adapter markets.

Montross said BusLogic specifically adds key SCSI technology
and ASIC development to Mylex's technology base.

Mylex, which produces RAID technology and network management
products, reported $62.5 million in sales during its 1994 fiscal
year and earned $7.5 million.

Vanstar-Ingram partnering pact emphasizes services

By:
Jack Sweeney

London-At first glance, it may resemble a clever shortcut in
the race to support global customers, but when Vanstar Corp.
officially announces Ingram Micro Inc. as its global-fulfillment
partner this month, few channel executives will likely dismiss
the gravity behind one of the industry's top corporate resellers'
outsourcing its core competency.

Besides endorsing the success of Ingram's overseas distribution
model, Vanstar's fulfillment pact seems to underscore that
the business of managing and fulfilling inventory is no longer
the center of the wheel when it comes to reseller business
models. Instead, services are becoming the hub around which
customers are orbiting.

By partnering with Ingram, Vanstar executives said they will
soon match the more uniform fulfillment strategies of services
giants such as EDS Corp. and distance itself from the less
seamless fulfillment schemes of its reseller rivals such as
Entex Information Services Inc. and Inacom Corp., which now
support global customers through overseas affiliates.

"We have a list of about 25 different resellers right now that
are Europe- as well as U.S.-based; and of those, we expect
a fair number to become [fulfillment] partners of ours in 1996,"
said John Winkelhaus, senior vice president of Ingram Micro
Europe. "We are helping them leapfrog certain U.S. competitors
because even though we are charging them for fulfillment, it
will be less costly than if they tried to do it themselves
and we already have it in place, allowing them to focus on
supplying IT services."

Richard Simms, chairman and chief executive of Software Spectrum
Inc., a Dallas-based software reseller that today allows Ingram
to supply product fulfillment services to its European customers,
said, "It is almost inconceivable to me that Software Spectrum
would ever start operating distribution centers in Europe or
anywhere else in the world."

Christine Ferrusi Ross, an analyst with Dataquest Corp., Framingham,
Mass., said growth in the number of offshore fulfillment pacts
reflects a growing urgency among national resellers to provide
global solutions. "I think you can either be a global player
today or you can be a local regional player, but you can't
really compete on a national level anymore unless you're willing
to compete globally," said Ferrusi Ross.

Vanstar's rivals praised the reseller's initiative and the speed
with which it hoped to link up with Ingram, but said it was
too early to determine the model's effectiveness.

Peter Alexander, the former head of Vanstar's Global subsidiary
ComputerLand International, said the model might resemble the
one now being built by Ameridata Corp., which last June hired
Alexander to run its global operations.

"I think, generally, Vanstar's direction is the same one we've
been following and the question that has to be raised is what
exactly will the new Vanstar model entail? Will it be one organization
'umbrella-ing' its franchisees, or is it a hybrid between the
Vanstar and its franchisees?" said Alexander.

Last month, Vanstar Chairman William Tauscher said Vanstar's
model would try to leverage the different skill sets of ComputerLand
International's franchisees.

"The product supply network that we are putting together on
a worldwide basis will be available to our franchisees for
Pan-European arrangements and, in addition to that, we will
be enlisting our franchisees as high-end providers in conjunction
with our own high-end network operations that we are now opening
up in multiple countries," said Tauscher.

Channel sets sights on a more prosperous 1996 -- Putting problem
plagued 1995 behind the industry

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second part of a look at business
issues facing the industry.

New York-If 1996 is any different than 1995 for the industry's
leading channel players, it has to be an improvement.

After suffering through a year of slow systems conversions,
open sourcing, intense pricing pressures and numerous quarterly
losses, channel companies are looking forward to putting 1995
behind them in hopes of a better 1996. Indications are things
will improve.

Vanstar Corp., Pleasanton, Calif., has already filed for an
initial public offering. And many channel observers feel that
move, combined with the expected IPO of Ingram Micro Inc.,
Santa Ana, Calif., in the coming months, will help the entire
sector. Entex Information Services Inc., Rye Brook, N.Y., may
also enter the public market this year.

In addition, recent results from Tech Data Corp., Clearwater,
Fla., indicate the company is back on track. CompuCom Systems
Inc., Dallas, is projected to continue to benefit from its
emphasis on integration and services. Meanwhile, other channel
players hope to return to profitability with service offerings
of their own.

"1996 is the year for service and support," said Benny Lorenzo,
portfolio manager at PAW Partners L.P., based in Greenwich,
Conn.

Other signs also point to an improved year. Jim Daniel, chief
financial officer at MicroAge Inc., Tempe, Ariz., said an emerging
upgrade cycle coupled with IBM Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.'s
plans to re-embrace the channel, are positive signs.

"It's clearly going to be a better year than 1995," Daniel said.

However, not all analysts are convinced the channel's struggles
are a thing of the past.

Robert Anastasi, senior vice president at The Robinson-Humphrey
Co. Inc., Atlanta, said the corporate resellers seem to be
best-positioned for the upcoming year.

"It will be a good year for them from a financial standpoint
and a market receptivity standpoint," Anastasi said.

However, Anastasi said he believes questions remain about the
rest of the sector.

"For the wholesalers, I think you will have a year of haves
and have-nots," Anastasi said, explaining that Ingram and Tech
Data will enjoy success, but Merisel Inc., El Segundo, Calif.,
still needs to improve on its execution.

In addition, Anastasi said that he was still unsure when the
master resellers would be able to complete their new business
models now that open sourcing has become a reality.

"I think '96 is still a bit of a transitional year for the master
resellers," said Anastasi.

HIGHEST IN SOFTWARE, TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- New Year to bring
wave of mergers, acquistions

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-By the time 1996 comes to a close, industry insiders
may be referring to it as the year of the merger, if a recent
report by Broadview Associates Inc. turns out to be correct.

The Fort Lee, N.J.-based merger and acquisition advisor said
64 percent of information technology companies are "very likely"
to pursue mergers or acquisitions over the next 12 months.

Broadview said several trends in the industry are creating the
need or desire to merge, including the rush to the Internet,
client/server technologies being fully deployed, the convergence
of media and technology and the accelerating pace of technological
change.

The strong pace of acquisitions will be a continuation of what
took place during 1995. Broadview recorded 684 transactions
in the IT industry during the first half of 1995 alone, compared
with 760 total transactions in all of 1994.

The study predicts the highest rates of merger and acquisition
activity will occur in the software products and services,
and telecommunications sectors. In that area, nearly one-third
of the companies reported they are "more likely" to pursue
such a transaction during the upcoming year than in the previous
year.

The media and content services sector, which includes print,
digital and online media, is also expected to show a high rate
of merger activity.

The most popular reason cited for seeking a merger or acquisition
was to "increase earnings"; to "increase revenue" also was
often selected. Other reasons given included "attainment of
leadership in an existing market" and "presence in a converging
market."

Broadview's study also found the largest IT companies are the
most likely to pursue acquisitions, with 78 percent of those
companies with at least $500 million in annual sales saying
they are "very likely" to pursue acquisitions this year.

Stock appears to be an increasingly preferred method for transactions.
One-quarter of the companies in the study said they will fund
their deals solely with stock, up from just 11 percent that
said they completed transactions this way in the past.

BASED ON INTERNAL MODEL -- CTP creates tool for knowledge sharing
on Net

By:
KEVIN MERRILL

Cambridge, Mass.-Cambridge Technology Partners is bundling consulting
and training on a new Internet application.

The application is designed to let corporations harness internal
knowledge, from software to human resource policies, and allow
employees access across the World Wide Web.

The first customers started receiving five-day training on KnowledgeShare,
as the Internet solution is called, within the past two weeks.
CTP, a systems integrator, consultancy and custom application
developer, built the service based on its own similar internal
tool.

"[KnowledgeShare] is a starting point for a strategic direction
we're taking to deploy Internet-based technology as a legitimate
platform for building business applications for our clients,"
said Bob Gett, president of CTP North America.

CTP has set fixed prices, but may bill for additional consulting
time, based on how much assistance the company needs in capturing
and storing its data. The KnowledgeShare service prices range
from $150,000 to $200,000. The amounts do not include the hardware
to store the data, or the browsers that employees would need
to access the system.

The service, a combination of software, training and consulting,
differs from a traditional corporate home page in three ways,
Gett said: the consultancy work that is built around it; the
five-day training and reduced development time, compared with
Web pages; and the document-creating software engines.

Gett said CTP has built firewalls and other security measures
to protect the data repository, adding KnowledgeShare can be
used for limited or open internal access or as a public Web
site.

The company plans to add enhanced document-search and imaging
scanning capabilities in future versions. KnowledgeShare uses
CTP's document-management software as the back-end data storage
and search engine.

"What a KnowledgeShare user sees is not a static list of HTML
pages," said Bruce Rosen, a senior technical consultant for
CTP and development manager for KnowledgeShare. "Running in
the back is a document-management engine. We've written an
interface between the Web and the back-end engine."

Among the possible data storage uses are company practices and
policies, sales presentations and reusable software components.

The five-day training is structured as a hands-on seminar. CTP
consults with companies to help them through the process of
identifying knowledge, processing it and then merging it into
KnowledgeShare.

"We're not teaching clients how to write HTML code," Rosen said.
"We're teaching them how to use knowledge within their company."

The type of employees sent to training represent three categories
 someone from within the IS department who knows the corporate
server configuration and network aspects; a person who can
identify the resources within a company to assist in the knowledge
gathering process; and a trainer who is expected to coordinate
post-training within the corporation.

CTP also is developing a video for companies to use to train
other employees.

Memorex-Telex targets integrators with service -- Resources
diverted from network management

By:
KEVIN MERRILL

Irving, Texas-A services reselling program from Memorex-Telex
Corp. is allowing integrators and VARs to divert resources
away from routine network management and maintenance.

Companies like Sun Data Inc., an Atlanta-based integrator, instead
are building internal expertise in systems consulting and project
management and implementation, and outsourcing service pieces
to Memorex-Telex, Irving.

"It doesn't make sense to fly our people all over the country
to do a LAN setup," said Robert Spessard Jr., vice president,
marketing and professional services at Sun Data.

Memorex-Telex launched its Gold Services Partner Program earlier
this year, after starting a beta cycle about a year ago and
receiving input from a group representing customers, including
resellers. The program is an offshoot of its 18-month-old Advanced
Services program, which was itself a push by Memorex-Telex
into services.

"When our resellers look at us, they don't say, 'Can you fix
a computer in Bangor, Maine?' Instead, they're asking us to
help design and monitor and keep systems up and running," said
Preston Lawhorne, director of channel sales and development.

Resellers get 5 percent to 15 percent off list price when reselling
services, broken into four categories: strategic services,
network integration, performance control and education.

"The deals that we're winning are ones we would not have won
direct," Lawhorne said.

Sun Data's decision to use Memorex-Telex services is coupled
with its own internal strategy of strengthening its integrated
solution-selling business through building competencies in
the open systems world. To do that, they placed an emphasis
on recruiting and placing senior-level service personnel to
provide the higher-level consulting and project design work
for customers, as well as some limited service work.

"You have to have those people on board," Spessard said. "You
can't outsource that." The company expects to double the size
of its professional service staff this year.

The decision to focus on building a senior-level service staff
as opposed to a service army, when coupled with the move to
outsource some service engagements to Memorex-Telex, has allowed
it to speed its consulting and project management.

It also gave Sun Data broader geographic coverage and additional
system expertise. Those resources give its budding consulting
and project management work greater appeal, Spessard said.
The reasons to contract with Memorex-Telex are similar with
other integrators.

"For me to hire [Certified Novell Engineers] and [Enterprise
CNEs] would have been a nightmare," said Robert Bova, director
of network integration at Oliver Allen Corp., Larkspur, Calif.
"Instead of reinventing the wheel, why bother?"

Oliver Allen brings Memorex-Telex into the bidding process,
and has it provide quotes on services before a final package
is submitted to the customer.

Bova said Oliver Allen started its Memorex-Telex relationship
first by selling some of its products, and then transitioned
into reselling service packages. "By throwing services into
the mix, it makes us an even better customer," he said.

Memorex-Telex, which established a service and support partnership
with Novell Inc., expects to establish a similar relationship
with Microsoft Corp. for Windows NT support, Lawhorne said.

SOFTWARE ARTISTRY PLANS CHANNEL PUSH -- Tool For Asset Management

By:
Kevin Merrill

Software Artistry Inc. is planning a channel push to coincide
with the release of its asset management tool, Expert Foundation
Manager.

The Indianapolis-based developer of service and support solutions
is using its Expert Partners Program to identify and work with
companies that provide complementary hardware, software or
service solutions.

At its annual sales meeting this week, current and potential
Expert Partners will explain their products and services to
Software Artistry's direct sales force. That sales force will
then make referrals to partners based on areas of expertise,
from asset inventory services to hardware procurement and help
desk outsourcing.

"We're providing a very strong tool for them to be successful
in managing that outsourcing engagement," said Rich Cunningham,
Expert Partners program manager. "Through these alliances,
we're able to sell a lot of our product."

Infolink Corp., an asset-management services firm based in Denver,
started to resell Foundation Manager to complement the information
collecting tools and services it provides.

"We think our services fit hand-in-glove," said Joe Castro,
Infolink's president and chief executive.

Asset management is becoming a potential value-added service
of integrators and VARs who help corporations identify and
manage IT assets, and then build on those services by providing
hardware, software or support.

CompuCom Systems Inc., the Dallas-based integrator and corporate
reseller, started reselling SA-Expert Advisor-a support center
tool-several years ago to deploy it in help-desk operations
it provided for corporate customers. CompuCom is expanding
its SA relationship to include SA-Expert Foundation Manager.

"Anywhere they have a customer, we see a great fit," said Brian
O'Connell, vice president of support center services.

It was Software Artistry's relationship with companies like
CompuCom that helped to shape and give momentum to the creation
of the Expert Partners Program.

"Asset management is definitely a concept that's here," O'Connell
said.

"If I'm going to build a call center, I want to do it with a
forward-looking view. But to get the benefit, companies will
have to establish a process by which they compile the information,"
O'Connell added.

The Expert Partners Program started forming in August.

The certification categories include Certified Product Provider,
Services Provider and Outsourcing Services Provider.

Training covers technical and sales and marketing subjects,
Cunningham said. "The whole area of asset management is growing.

"Just putting a tool out there is not enough for companies to
put an asset management program in place," he added.

Partners get access to early releases and co-op marketing calendars,
Cunningham said.

Help Desk



CRN's "Help Desk" forum provides Service & Support-related answers
to industry issues. This week's answer is provided by Dave
Fletcher, vice president at Science Applications International
Corp., Albuquerque, N.M.

Q: What are the issues to consider when marketing service and
support offerings?

A: Market to gain support for new services, and to increase
participation in and clarify your service offerings, and developing
relationships. The basis of marketing has to be relationships.
Anything that furthers a relationship, not just sells a product,
is where they need to focus.

The first thing you have to do is differentiate all your service
and support offerings. And most organizations don't. They do
a blanket marketing, whether it's a brochure, flier or poster.

One of the first things to do is understand the industry and
understand the industry benchmarks. You need to be competitive
and be able to present someone a case that you can not only
provide the expertise, because I think that's a given. When
people start to look outside to outsource, they've already
agreed that you are the expert. In addition, you have to prove
that you're cost-effective.

If it's outsourcing just the help desk, then you want to market
to someone that's looking to outsource to you.

You have to be able to identify how the help desk will provide
value to the other parts of the organization.

CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Redmond, Wash.-Microsoft Corp. and NBC have a strategy to make
PCs more interactive and informative with live and continuous
news, but they are not the first.

Intel Corp. and Turner Broadecasting Inc.'s Cable News Network
first brought news to the PC about a year ago. CNN at Work,
which was rolled out last June, brings CNN headline news, features
and stock reports to corporate PCs across the local-area network.
Corporate servers receive the broadcast feed through cable
or a satellite hookup.

Atlanta-based CNN then rolled out the project's newest feature,
a new financial network called CNN FN (financial news). The
new network was added to Intel's CNN at Work.

And just last month, Intel enhanced the service with the ability
to conduct personal profiles so the software automatically
grabs information of importance to a particular user for his
review later. For example, if a user is interested in videoconferencing,
the service will download every story with that key word included
in the text and save it for the individual.

CNN at Work subscriptions are priced at an individual subscription
rate of $12.50 per month. The Multimedia specialized gateway
that transforms the analog signal to CNN at Work's digital
format is priced at $4,995. But unlike Microsoft, Intel has
not discussed plans to move across the Internet.

Microsoft, based here, is looking to make significant strides
after much industry criticism for being late to enter the Internet
market. With broadcast giant NBC, the two will launch a 24
hour news and information channel for the television, and an
online news service distributed on The Microsoft Network for
PCs.

The cable service, MS-NBC Cable, will roll out within six months,
aiming for 35 million subscribers by the year 2000. Microsoft
will pay $220 million over five years with a 50 percent interest
in MS-NBC Cable. NBC will invest $200 million over the next
five years. NBC is in charge of the news content.

"We're bringing the interactive world into integration with
broadcast-by interactivity, we mean the Internet," said Bill
Gates, chief executive of Microsoft. "Over time, video will
be an important data type, as well as audio and text already
available there [on the Internet]."

He added that this type of technology will make the news "far
more attractive.''

Grappling for Net share -- Microsoft, Spyglass expand licensing
agreement

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Naperville, Ill.-As competition heats up, companies continue
to jockey for positioning in the ever-expanding marketplace
of the Internet.

Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., and Spyglass Inc., based here,
have expanded their licensing agreement established earlier
this year-a move that signals a further separation between
Microsoft and Internet rival Netscape Communications Corp.

Microsoft reportedly is planning to adopt the programming technology
of Sun Microsystems Inc., called Java, yet the company continues
to steer clear of Netscape's technology.

Microsoft and Netscape have taken opposite stands on technology
surrounding the Internet. For example, the companies are working
in two different camps on a security standard that would ensure
secure credit-card transactions over the Internet.

Browser technology by Spyglass, called Mosaic, is already at
the core of Microsoft's Explorer browser software, used within
The Microsoft Network. This month's agreement names Spyglass
as Microsoft's primary technology supplier for World Wide Web
technologies, officials said.

"We are focused on providing the client and server technology
that is incorporated into their products," said Marc Miller,
executive vice president of Spyglass.

The joint development efforts include Visual Basic Scripting,
OLE Controls, SSL/PCT, STT and Blackbird viewing technologies
integrated with HTML.

Spyglass also will create a Microsoft-compatible Unix and Windows
NT Web server to be sold through Microsoft's distribution channel,
Spyglass said.

Web Sites: DataQuest, O'Reilly, Word

By:
KEN YAMADA

This week, CRN reviews three Web sites that contain useful information
for resellers about computer industry news and trends, and
an unusual site developed by a VAR.

The first site reviewed was developed by Dataquest Inc., a San
Jose, Calif., market-research firm whose research analysts
are often quoted in the media.

The second site reviewed was developed by O'Reilly & Associates
Inc., Sebastapol, Calif., a publisher of technical books and
software. The third site is an online magazine created by New
York systems integrator ICon CMT Corp.

Dataquest Inc.

The Dataquest home page lacks the impressive graphics and design
features of other Web sites, and, instead, simply serves up
what it does best-computer industry information.

Dataquest researches information about trends related to various
aspects of the computer industry, such as tracking sales of
CD-ROM drives, PC systems, software and other products. In
report form, this type of information is of great value. On
the Web site however, highlights from the reports, which contain
snippets of analysis and statistics, are accessible for free.
The site also contains useful information from past Dataquest
newsletters.

O'Reilly & Associates Inc.

Initially born as a publisher of books for the computer industry,
O'Reilly has aggressively embraced the Web by developing its
own Web browser, and now, this Web site.

At this in-house-created site, O'Reilly offers an online magazine,
"ora.com," which contains articles related to programming,
networking, Web publishing and other technical subjects written
by company editors and authors, and by guest experts. But some
links with promising names, such as "sales channels" and "online
market research," appear as marketing vehicles to sell O'Reilly
reports.

Word

This quirky site demonstrates how the Internet can bring out
the creative side of a systems integrator.

Developed by ICon CMT Corp., formerly known as ICon International,
New York, this site functions as an online magazine a la Wired.
While focusing more on lifestyles and trendy, youth-oriented
topics than does Wired, it follows Wired's lead in creative
use of graphics, sassy attitude and offbeat stories.

With no publishing experience, but a lot of technical expertise,
ICon dived into the world of digital publishing with this site.
Word, with its fancy graphics, sound and other multimedia features,
eats up valuable bandwidth and processing power while at the
same time offering an interesting experience-provided you are
willing to wait for it.

Broadcast video to hit Internet -- Technology will create new
opportunities for resellers to enhance clients' Web Sites

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

San Mateo, Calif.-Video broadcasting over the Internet is expected
to become prevalent as early as 1996, and VARs that want to
spice up their Internet portfolios are now able to get their
hands on the technology.

Such advanced multimedia technologies have had a hard time flying
in the traditional enterprise network arena.

The idea of viewing video over a PC is largely considered a
luxury item and certainly a low priority to corporate heads
when products come with high price tags. But the Internet's
World Wide Web not only encourages slick graphics, interaction
and sophisticated realtime applications, but it also distributes
content at affordable prices-if the data is compressed enough.

"Streaming audio hit the Net in '95, and '96 will be the year
for streaming video," said Jeff Pulver, publisher of Netwatch,
an online electronic newsletter on new technologies, based
in Great Neck, N.Y. "This is truly a step forward; such technologies
introduced on the Net are leading-edge, providing increasing
value to everyone from pure technologists to end users."

"Streaming" means video is being downloaded and viewed simultaneously.
To date, video is typically viewed over the Internet through
a store-and-forward method, which takes a long time to transmit
before it can be viewed. A three-minute video clip can take
about a half-hour to download before it is seen.

Video over the Internet will give VARs and systems integrators
the ability to enhance clients' Web sites with very sophisticated
next-generation realtime applications.

By running the technology over either the Internet or private
TCP/IP networks, radio stations can send live radio broadcasts,
and news services can send full-motion video feeds of financial
programs to financial traders.

Pioneers of the technology include entertainment companies,
broadcasters and advertisers; however, experts anticipate more
widespread use of the technology beginning next year due to
some early products by vendors such as Xing Technology Corp.
and VDOnet Corp.

At the core of Santa Clara, Calif.-based VDOnet's desktop video
broadcasting flagship product, called VDOLive, is a scalable
compression algorithm that compresses video small enough to
run over the small bandwidth portions of the Internet, as well
as increase the quality of video with expanded bandwidth.

A communications protocol within the technology maintains the
integrity of the video as it weaves through the complex network
of the Internet, officials said.

VDOLive video can run in realtime at 15 frames per second over
analog with a 28.8-Kbit-per-second modem, but this is when
the Internet is not in its rush hour, noted Asaf Mohr, president
and chief executive of VDOnet. The technology is currently
in beta-testing, slated for availability in early 1996.

Arroyo Grande, Calif.-based Xing is a leading supplier of MPEG
player software to video board and video software companies.
It unveiled a product called StreamWorks, which, like VDOLive,
works with existing Web servers and browsers, and runs over
analog and ISDN or greater infrastructures.

StreamWorks is based on software-based MPEG (Motion Picture
Experts Group) video and audio compression.

The cost of the technology is about $3,500 for the server software,
and the client software is downloaded free by the user via
a company's home page.

Recently, Netscape Communications Corp. allowed for plug-in
capabilities to be built to its Netscape Navigator 2.0. Because
VDOLive and StreamWorks support the popular browser, VARs can
more easily build the video features into clients' Web sites.

Two-way video-not to be confused with one-way broadcast video
is also slowly unfolding over the Net.

Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., decided the best way
to make its mark in the highly competitive videoconferencing
arena is to make its product Internet-ready.

Officials claim that since the availability of its QuickTime
Conferencing kit last month, it has seen a rush of orders not
only from business interests, but consumers as well.

Now the company plans to extend the technology into wider markets
and infrastructures.

A source close to the company said creating a version of QTC
for regular analog is "squarely on the road map for 1996."
Apple officials have also said they will likely offer a Windows
based version of the product.

CU-SeeMe is another desktop videoconferencing applications that
runs over the Internet. The application was developed at Cornell
University and is licensed to White Pine Software, Nashua,
N.H.

Var Has Religious Experience -- Husky Labs broadcast live video
Pope over Internet

By:
Charlotte Dunlap

Without a doubt, David Levine's biggest integration project
to date has to be broadcasting live video coverage over the
Internet of Pope John Paul II during his U.S. visit this fall.

After all, the VAR estimates about 10,000 Net users viewed the
live video broadcast, which was accomplished using technology
very new to the Internet.

Levine, president of Husky Labs, Shepards, W.Va., achieved the
amazing feat of piping streaming video over the Internet via
the technology of Xing Technology Corp. Its flagship product,
called StreamWorks, accomplishes a level of compression that
allowed Levine to deliver the Pope across the Internet at three
high-quality frames of video per second and continuous audio.

"Video is like icing on the cake, once you have your Web server.
Anyone can become a broadcaster and compete with CBS and NBC,"
Levine said, referring to the technique as "datacasting."

Levine used the downlink feed from the broadcast satellite in
New Jersey through a hardware encoder. Internet users could
tap the video via the Web server of Levine's client, the Catholic
Information Center, using popular Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator.

MODULAR LINES CAN REPRESENT STRONG INCREMENTAL REVENUE -- Groupware
on a smaller scale

By:
BARBARA DARROW

Waltham, Mass-There is a bevy of new products VARs can offer
accounts that need to facilitate collaboration but do not want
to go to a full-blown groupware package.

Many accounts have departments that need some workflow, some
discussion threads or other facets of groupware without needing
to go the full nine yards, analysts said. And modular products
that go into existing accounts, where the VAR has sold networking
infrastructure or mail, can represent profitable incremental
revenue.

Hyperdesk Corp., Westborough, Mass., is now beta-testing a new
version of its GroupWorks project-management software with
support for Windows 95 and NT and the ability to send OLE objects,
sound bites and other attachments. GroupWorks 2.0 lets teams
schedule people and tasks, using existing E-mail as its backbone.
The product can now utilize an address book complying with
the Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) or Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI), said Tom Rose, director of product
marketing.

Internet integration is also a new perk. Users can link World
Wide Web addresses with task assignments, contact pages or
discussion topics. The recipient then clicks on the icon to
launch the browser and open the linked Web page.

"With the ability to be customized, it can be implemented in
vertical markets. . . . [VARs could do] a custom accounting
version or a legal version with ticklers for the courts," said
Bryan Quibell, president of MCC Electronic Publishing Group,
a Spring Grove, Pa.-based VAR specializing in legal- and electronic
publishing verticals. "We weren't looking for a product to
resell, more for an internal implementation, but I was so impressed
we will resell it," Quibell said.

GroupWorks addresses a different niche than Collabra Software
Inc.'s Collabra Share, which provides threaded discussions,
said Jim Garden, an analyst with Workgroup Technologies Inc.,
Hampton, N.H. "This is more a project orientation for team
management. Typically when you work with a team you need to
gather their status, find out where they are." GroupWorks provides
dispersed teams with an asynchronous way to meet and share
information, he said.

Of course, the definition of groupware is always an issue in
discussing such projects. No two definitions of the term seem
the same. Eric Brown, a senior analyst at Forrester Research
Inc., Cambridge, Mass., defines groupware as "a passive, infrastructural
activity." Into that category, he would put phones, LANs and
other pipelines that help people communicate across departments,
time and geography. Applications like GroupWorks are "more
structured. These are nice project-management tools, and GroupWorks
is unique in that it pulls together documents, people, and
calendaring and scheduling in one topic-oriented presentation,"
he said.

GroupWorks had gone mostly direct, but the company has lined
up 16 reseller partners and is looking for more, Rose said.

Future plans call for tighter integration with existing project
management applications, such as Microsoft Project, analysts
said. In addition, more integration with the Internet will
be added, so teams connected only by the public network can
link up and share project data.

New pricing for the product, due out this month, is $199 for
the first license and $99 for each additional license. Volume
discounts are available. VARs can download a trial copy from
the Web for free at http://www.hyperdesk.com. That copy can
be used for 30 days.

Also in groupware, Teamaker Corp., Beaverton, Ore., is offering
scheduling and time-tracking software for the office. Office
Hours gives users access to four programs: an In/Out Board
to note location status; an Employee Browser showing location
and phone/pager information for personnel; a TimeCard Module
to analyze productivity and track billable hours; and a Company
Events calendar to boost employee awareness of events and functions.
A 16-bit Windows 3.X version is available now, and a Windows
95 version is due next year. One copy running on the server
will support up to 50 users. The 16-bit version lists for $149.95
per server.

Commence Corp., formerly Jensen-Jones Inc., Red Bank, N.J.,
offers group-enabled information-management software that also
helps groups keep on track with projects. Commence 3.0 Workgroup
Information management software offers project management,
agent-based task automation, contact management, and calendaring
and scheduling. Suggested retail price is $295 for the personal
version and $395 for client and server components.

McAfee Revs Its Network Management Product Line

By:
SHAWN WILLETT

Santa Clara, Calif.-McAfee Associates Inc. revved three of its
network management products and shipped the first of its new
universal management consoles.

The company's SiteInventory 4.0 is based on technology acquired
from BrightWork Development Inc., which McAfee bought last
year. The product gathers information about the hardware and
software on PC networks and servers and puts them into reports.

Version 4.0 includes the new McAfee Systems Management Console,
which will eventually be the console for all of McAfee's products.

"Eventually you will be able to drill down into the console
and get several views of the network using information gathered
from all the McAfee products," said Tracey Mustacchio, product
manager for SiteInventory. The console is Windows-based and
is OLE (object linking and embedding)-enabled, she added.

Version 4.0 also allows for reporting of several servers at
a time. "Before, you had to take an extra step and consolidate
reports," said Mustacchio.

Support for Novell Inc.'s NetWare Directory Services (NDS),
TCP/IP and IPX and additional hardware recognition capabilities
are all part of the new release. Pricing has not yet been determined.

McAfee also unveiled SiteMeter 5.1, a new version of its software
metering and compliance software. Version 5.1 supports SNMP
(standard network management protocol), meaning it sends software
usage information up to enterprise consoles such as Hewlett
Packard Co.'s OpenView or IBM Corp.'s NetView.

Reports on software usage can be captured in an XBase format,
allowing FoxPro, dBase and other databases to import data.
The new version also meters applications stored on users' local
drives. Pricing starts at $20 a node for a two-year subscription
fee.

McAfee introduced version 5.5 of its Saber LAN Workstation product,
which it acquired from Saber Software Inc.

"This is the first McAfee integrated product. We also wanted
to prepare the installed base for our Windows 95 product,"
said Liz Bross, product manager for the Saber LAN Workstation
line. The version that will manage Windows 95 desktops is due
in the first quarter of next year, said McAfee officials. Bross
said the new version includes several modules from the McAfee
side of the house. Saber LAN Workstation is sold on a two-year
subscription basis at a price of $47 per node.

Microsoft Teams With Wall Data

By:
Shawn Willett

San Mateo, Calif.-Microsoft Corp. and Wall Data Inc. joined
forces to offer a host connectivity bundle. The bundle includes
Microsoft's SNA Server, which provides a server connection
to an IBM mainframe, and Wall Data's Rumba, client emulation
software that allows PCs to access mainframe applications.
Dubbed the Rumba-SNA Server Solution Pack, it will sell for
$1,484 for a server and a five-user license of Rumba Office.

"What the channel will get is a single SKU, with two boxes and
all the appropriate licenses," said York Baur, Wall Data's
vice president of product marketing.

The bundle will be sold exclusively through distributor Tech
Data Corp.

The bundle will be tested, and both support staffs will be trained
to deal with the other company's products. "For the reseller
channel, there is going to be a much higher degree of success
and lower level of support to deal with," said Baur.

Monitors: The Squeeze Is On

By:
William Terdoslavich

The monitor is a commodity product, which by nature is going
to carry a low margin. Unfortunately, no PC can go out the
door without one.

The worst-case scenario for a VAR is to try to get as close
to break-even on the monitor portion of the contract, or find
something else to make up for the margin. Other VARs have found
better ways to prop up their monitor margins.

One problem VARs have is unwanted retail competition. The VAR
runs the risk of seeing its monitor offering undercut by a
lower price at a nearby retail outlet, said H.B. Peters, owner
of Matrix Enterprises, Shelton, Wash. "It's hard to compete
like that," he said.

Even the gap between the reseller's price and the SRP is too
close for comfort. It is not unusual to purchase a high-end
monitor for $675 and sell it at the SRP for $699, a gap of
$24 that also has to cover shipping costs, Peters noted.

"It would be nice to make a couple of dollars on the side as
they [the monitors] go by instead of paying the freight," Peters
said.

At Entre Computer Center, Albuquerque, N.M., monitor margins
are just fine, thank you. But that is because Entre has a different
approach to carrying monitors.

"Most monitors we are using are our own private label," said
Pat Bachechi, manager. Entre gets its monitors from Intelligent
Electronics Inc., Exton, Pa., which in turn OEMs the units
from a manufacturer. The monitors come in without labels, allowing
Entre to stamp its own name on them, Bachechi explained. The
unit even comes with a three-year warranty.

Monitor margins are just fine for Mega Micro Computer, though
being located in Great Falls, Mont., may have something to
do with it. Owner David Rasmussen said he is enjoying margins
of 15 percent to 18 percent on 14-inch monitors, and 20 percent
to 25 percent on 17-inch monitors and above.

Exploiting demand is the key to this technique. Rasmussen carries
a very limited inventory of the larger monitors. "I only keep
one on hand," he said, "usually something I know I can move."
For larger monitors, Rasmussen said he handles either Viewsonic
Corp. or NEC Technologies Inc. As for the smaller monitors,
margin is maintained through "good salesmanship," he added.

The Future Now, based in Cincinnati, is in the same boat as
other VARs. Monitor margins are ranging only from three to
seven points, said Linda Newsome, executive assistant to the
director of sales. "We sell them based on what the market will
carry."

Margins are above the seven-point mark when handling larger
monitors "because it is a limited field," Newsome said. After
that, The Future Now, acquired by Intelligent Electronics,
leans on its relationship with its new owner. "With Intelligent
Electronics, the wheels are greased by its distribution system.
The freight is passed on to the customer," she said.

Among vendors, providing the VAR channel with an incentive to
carry a monitor can take on a number of different forms. Some
vendors will rely on promotional features to send some dollars
back to the VAR. Still other vendors will find a way of crafting
price and availability to keep margins higher without reliance
on promotional tools.

Spiffs are one tool used by NEC, Wood Dale, Ill. A recent promotion
for the MultiSynch XV17 monitor offers the VAR $25 for every
monitor sold, said Pam Himmel, marketing manager.

Still another technique NEC has used is to pick up the freight
charges for monitor shipment. This may sound modest, but Himmel
pointed out that a 21-inch monitor can weigh around 80 pounds,
so freight becomes a significant cost of handling.

While spiffs and freight deals are some ways NEC can place or
leave cash in a reseller's pocket, the monitor's sticker price
can also play a role. By pitching a quality unit to the market,
"we frequently charge a premium for our product," Himmel said.
The higher price tag in turn translates into more margin dollars
for the VAR.

MAG InnoVision Inc. launched an improved version of its reseller
program. Called the Ultimate Reseller Program, MAG will be
providing immediate phone assistance to its authorized resellers
on a priority basis, and forwarding corporate and end-user
calls to authorized resellers. A corporate development program
will provide assistance to resellers in closing corporate sales.

Samsung Electronics America Inc., Ridgefield, N.J., is running
two national promotions, said John Grundy, senior national
marketing manager. One uses the monitor invoice as a raffle
ticket for a free BMW, with one car a month being given away
over five months. The second promotion is "a trade-up program
aimed at corporate accounts" to upgrade to a 17-inch monitor,
Grundy said. Any color 14-inch or 15-inch monitor bearing the
IBM, Compaq, Sony or NEC brand names can be traded in to qualify
for a $75 or $100 check when purchasing a 17-inch monitor.
"It's a sales tool for the VAR" to stir the installed base,
he added.

Without promotions, Samsung costs about 10 percent to 15 percent
less than its competitors, Grundy contended. "[But] it is not
necessary to pass on the cost savings to a corporate account,"
he said. "Most VARs get double-digit margins with Samsung monitors."

At ADI Systems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., resellers get a
break on demo units as a channel promotion. Up to two units
per model per year can be purchased at a discount to be used
as demo models, said Michelle Maldonado, channel marketing
manager.

Sony Electronics Inc., San Jose, Calif., has developed promotions
awarding redeemable points to resellers handling Sony monitors
that can be exchanged for other Sony-brand consumer goods,
said Chris Stocker, director of channel marketing.

But the real purpose is to build up a list of individual resellers,
rather than their companies, that Sony can contact directly
via their home addresses, Stocker pointed out. With a list
of 3,800 names, Sony can craft promotions for its monitors
that will reach only the resellers it needs.

At Sampo Technology Inc., Norcross, Ga., distribution is limited
to Ingram, Merisel, Tech Data and Gates-Arrow, according to
Norman Dybowski, director of marketing. This leaves distributors
getting by on a less margin, "opening up better opportunities
at higher margins for the VAR," he said. VARs can expect monitor
margins in the 10 to 12 percent range at the low end, while
high-end margins will run from 12 to 18 percent, he said.

Smile adds to monitor line at high end, midrange

By:
WILLIAM TERDOSLAVICH

Costa Mesa, Calif.-Smile International Inc. expanded its product
line with the addition of 20-inch and 21-inch monitors for
its high-end Rev 7 line, as well as new 15-inch and 17-inch
monitors for its more midrange Rev 5 line.

Smile is reaching the monitor market with four product lines.
In addition to Rev 7, with LCD status indicators, and Rev 5,
which has on-screen display, Smile puts out its Rev 3 line,
fully digital with LED, and its low-end Rev 1 analog monitors.
Among the four lines there are 12 monitors coming to market,
said Michael LaMar, marketing manager.

In the Rev 7 line, the CA2111 is priced at $1,780, and the CA2011
has a price tag of $1,345. Both monitors have .28mm dot pitch
and refresh rates of 100 hertz; 1600-x-1200 resolution; and
adapters for the Macintosh.

"We're putting these in the CAD and heavy graphics arena," LaMar
said. The monitors also feature "convergence adjustment," which
allows focused adjustment of just one line of pixels. This
feature will allow the elimination of blue shadows at the corners,
LaMar said.

While Smile had produced 20-inch and 21-inch monitors for other
vendors, this is the first time it has turned out the monitors
for its own nameplate, LaMar said.

Meanwhile, the CA1516SL and CA1716SL provide the foundation
for the Rev 5 line, which features OSD to distinguish it from
the lower-end lines. The 15-inch CA1516SL is priced at $420,
while the 17-inch CA1716SL carries a $720 price tag.

Viewsonic Adds New Monitor



Walnut, Calif.-Viewsonic Corp. added a 17-inch monitor to its
value-oriented Optiquest product line, sporting a 0.26mm dot
pitch and a price of $895. It begins shipping today.

The Optiquest V775 can deliver a resolution of 1600 x 1280 at
66 hertz, or 1024 x 768 at 90 hertz. This performance puts
the V775 squarely between two other Viewsonic monitors in terms
of performance-the high-end 17ps and 17gs.

The upgrade market for 17-inch monitors is split between high
end CAD and high-quality general purpose, said David Ball,
vice president of sales and marketing. Viewsonic did concede
several features to bring the V775 to less than $900. The three
year warranty only carries one year's worth of labor. No BNC
connectors are included, and while MPR-II compliant, it does
not meet TCO standards, he said.

Sampo Touts Pricing Of AlphaScan

By:
WILLIAM TERDOSLAVICH

Norcross, Ga.-Adding to its product line, Sampo Technology Inc.
launched a new 17-inch monitor at an aggressive price point
for units in its class.

Called the AlphaScan 760, the monitor is priced at $949, with
a street price that is expected to be about $100 lower, according
to Norman Dybowski, director of marketing. The monitor has
a 0.26mm dot pitch, a flat Diamondtron CRT, pushing 1280 x
1024 resolution at 80 hertz. Maximum resolution is 1600 x1200.

Sampo is looking to the VAR channel to push the new monitor.
"It is best-suited for really picky uses, like CAD graphics.
It's the ultimate clean screen," Dybowski said.

Sampo is deliberately following a limited distribution strategy
to keep its monitor margins up. Using only four national distributors
keeps the product line from being overdistributed, which in
turn can cut into prices and margins, Dybowski noted.

The AlphaScan 760 brings to three the number of 17-inch monitors
Sampo has in the market. The AlphaScan 17gx is similar, with
a 0.26mm dot pitch, but lower refresh rates at higher resolutions.
The 17mx offers a 0.28mm dot pitch, again lower refresh rates,
and a maximum resolution of only 1280 x 1024.

Other high-end monitor offerings include the AlphaScan GL, a
20-inch monitor with a .31mm dot pitch and 1280 x 1024 resolution.
Also part of the line is the AlphaScan GLX, a more richly-featured
20-inch monitor with a .28mm dot pitch and a resolution of
1600 x 1200.

Nanao brings B&W monitor to market

By:
William Terdoslavich

Torrance, Calif.-To Nanao USA Corp., the world of 21-inch monitors
is one that is seen in black-and-white, not color. Such is
the story behind the FlexScan 6600, a 21-inch grayscale monitor.

"It is specifically designed for document imaging," said Craig
Sloss, national sales and product marketing manager. "The advantage
over color is that we have a solid phosphor coating to give
you a tighter image."

The FlexScan 6600 offers 1600 x 1200 resolution at a flicker
free 85 hertz with 1,024 shades of gray. "With 1600 x 1200,
you can get the full document in 1-to-1 scale and see text
in 8-point and 10-point type without having to zoom in," Sloss
said. "That is impossible at lower resolutions."

Sticker price for the FlexScan 6600 is $1,277. The product is
an improvement over its predecessor, the FlexScan 6500, similarly
priced but offering the same resolution at a lower 66 hertz.

Panasonic revamps monitor line with new models

By:
William Terdoslavich

Secaucus, N.J.-Panasonic Systems & Communications Co. rounded
out its product line in a broad fashion by launching three
new monitors at Comdex/Fall, with plans to launch more new
models next year.

Launched were the S17, a $799 replacement for the 17-inch Model
1791; the P17, which is an $800 upgrade of the older 1792P;
and the P15, a $429 15-inch upgrade of the Model 1591.

All three models feature higher refresh rates and Windows 95
Plug and Play compatibility. The two 17-inch models are $50
to $100 less expensive than their predecessors, while the 15
inch model is $30 more expensive than its predecessor due to
the shortage of 15-inch CRTs.

"The S [series] is for standard, general-purpose business uses,"
said Mike Marusic, marketing manager for Secaucus-based Panasonic,
while the PS series is the pro line.

A new 15-inch monitor will be added in the spring to supplement
the P15, while the S17 will be the basis for two new multimedia
17-inch monitors due next year. Also expected in the spring
is a 21-inch model, either for the S or PS series, Marusic
said.

"All segments are becoming a commodity. People are looking for
feature sets," he said.

Panasonic also launched its PanaFlat PF17, a flat-screen monitor
with a .24mm dot pitch and 1600 x 1280 resolution. It is priced
at $1,199.

PL/1 now in phase-out stage? -- Opportunities abound for VARs,
integrators to aid in maigration to other languages

By:
DARRYL K. TAFT

Washington-Despite all the attention being given to modern programming
languages like Java, C and C++, there remains plenty of opportunity
for VARs, integrators and consultants in older programming
languages such as PL/1 and COBOL, particularly in migrating
to newer environments, according to a recent study.

A study released by Ernst & Young showed a majority of corporate
sites using PL/1 intend to phase out their PL/1 applications
through replacement or migration to COBOL or other languages.
Many of the sites will begin their conversions within the next
year, the study showed.

Fifty-nine percent of the 1,700 companies surveyed said they
are looking to move away from their PL/1 applications. Most
respondents said they viewed PL/1 as outdated and inappropriate
for today's computing environments, which are heavily geared
toward client/server architectures. The study showed COBOL
to be the language of choice for organizations moving away
from PL/1, with C and C++ coming in as second and third choices,
respectively. A solid 31 percent of the respondents said they
intend to convert to or rewrite their applications in COBOL,
with 10 percent planning to move to C and 7 percent moving
to C++

Ernst & Young conducted its study in August 1995 and included
companies in Europe and the United States. Results of the survey
reflect the purchasing plans of IT directors within some of
the world's largest corporations including AT&T Corp., Eastman
Kodak Co., Raytheon, South Western Bell, State Farm Insurance
and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Among some of the other factors against retaining PL/1-based
systems, survey respondents said it is difficult to find programmers
to work in the PL/1 language. In addition, they said PL/1 lacks
the multiplatform support of more modern and widely accepted
languages such as COBOL and C++

Citing the potential for VARs and integrators in this environment,
Hans-Peter Evers, managing director of Ernst & Young RE Products
in Utrecht, Netherlands, said: "This survey confirms the massive
flight from PL/1 and strong interest in COBOL, as well as a
critical need for an easy and painless solution for PL/1 migration."

Only 18 percent of the survey respondents said they had already
moved away from PL/1. Yet, 23 percent said they were satisfied
with PL/1 and believe it is the only language suitable for
their requirements. However, of those committed to migrating,
27 percent said they would convert their applications to another
environment, while 46 percent said they would totally rewrite
or replace the applications.

Moreover, 44 percent of the sites planning a migration from
PL/1 said they are changing platforms due to a move to client
server and downsizing efforts. An additional 28 percent said
they plan to move from PL/1 to standardize their environments.

"The year 2000 date change is also a compelling reason for companies
to migrate from PL/1 to COBOL," said Bill Ulrich, president
of Tactical Strategy Group Inc., an Aptos, Calif., VAR/integrator
that specializes in legacy system transitions. "While excellent
tool support exists for languages such as COBOL, the tool support
for PL/1 tends to be inadequate."

As many companies look to move to more modern development environments,
software suppliers such as IBM Corp. are delivering tools to
meet their needs. IBM has modernized the COBOL language with
object-oriented extensions. IBM's Visual Age for COBOL for
OS/2, COBOL Set for AIX and COBOL for MVS feature object-oriented
extensions that enable programmers to use a popular, long-lived
programming language to create advanced client/server applications
on the desktop and deploy objects across various platforms
and applications.

The Spin: Making Microsoft Blink ... Or, Who Were They Kidding?

By:
Jodi Mardesich

After Microsoft's big Internet strategy briefing in early December,
I was talking to a Microserf. In typical Microserf fashion,
he asked me what I thought about the day, so I told him I was
floored that they had actually decided to license Java from
Sun. "I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop," I told him.

"What do you mean?" he asked. I said, maybe you've signed a
letter of intent, but it won't be finalized, or you'll license
it, but won't really fully support it. . . . You get the drift.
He replied, "I'm hurt. I've worked for Microsoft for years
and we've always been open. I don't understand why people say
this about us. . . ."

Until that day, not many people expected Microsoft to actually
license Java. I started reporting for the story days before.
One IBM executive told me, "The Internet is all about standards.
It's all about being open. That's what we're going to focus
on, things that are open and cross platform. We're not going
to tell you if you want to take advantage of our interpretive
language, you have to use our browser, or if you want to use
our object technology, you have to use our platform." Meaning,
he thought Microsoft would tell us the opposite.

Instead, Microsoft said it would license Java. Officials painted
a lovely picture of an open landscape. You can use whatever
tools you want. We'll make runtimes for VB Script free on the
Internet. We'll support stuff across platforms. We'll give
away our browser and server for free.

Wait a minute. What happened? Six months ago, the story of the
year was Windows 95. Now everyone is focused on browsers and
the Web. Just months ago, Microsoft was the winner of the OS
wars. Developers were fleeing from other platforms to Windows
in droves. Novell gave up on its Appware cross platform development
and seemed to lose its focus, which was to deliver network
connectivity to users of all kinds of computers running whatever
operating system. Suddenly, all significant client work was
being done for Windows. The game was over. Or was it?

Why, if Windows is the development platform of choice, would
Microsoft start using the "cross-platform" word? A few years
ago when Microsoft was doing its dog-and-pony show with Windows
for Workgroups, I asked whether they'd do some sort of module
that would let Mac users share files and printers with Windows
users. They looked at me like I was insane. Windows was their
mantra. Let's all say it in unison. Windows! Windows! Windows!

Then Netscape came along. Who would have thought a small company
distributing free software on the Web would make Microsoft
blink? Well, after achieving a billion-dollar market capitalization,
Microsoft had to take notice. Not to mention the fact that
Netscape produces cool software that runs on other platforms
besides Windows 95 and updates it frequently. Say bye-bye to
three-year development cycles.

Also, with Java, Sun came up with an exciting idea and new tools
that change the way most people have thought about personal
computing. Even so, how could Microsoft possibly admit someone
else had done something cooler than they? And actually license
it?

It didn't take too long for the other shoe to drop. The next
week, Microsoft execs were telling us how great Microsoft tools
are, and that they'll be available sooner than Java. Microsoft
knows that he who controls the developers wins. Microsoft is
hurriedly crafting a plan to leverage OLE so all the thousands
of OLE developers can stay on the Microsoft bandwagon.

I can't wait to see how this progresses. Cast your votes for
Netscape et al or Microsoft at jmardesi@cmp.com.

No Messing with Texas in mobile PCs -- Steve Lair's flare for
being a strong vendor begins to pay off for TI in the notebook
arena

By:
Steven Burke & Kelley Damore

Texas Instruments Inc. is on the rise in the explosive mobile
market.

TI jumped to the No. 5 position in U.S. mobile-unit market share
in the third quarter of 1995, up from No. 7 in 1994, according
to International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market-research
firm. The company sold 53,000 notebooks in the United States
in the quarter, a jump of more than 100 percent from the same
period last year, according to IDC.

"TI has ramped up [its] marketing efforts and [its] channel
efforts, and it is starting to pay off," said Randy Giusto,
an analyst for IDC. "They have expanded the number of distributors,
resellers and retailers. TI always had innovative technology.
But in the past they were known as a great engineering company.
The problem was with marketing."

Analysts said much of the credit for TI's rise up the charts
goes to Steve Lair, who headed up marketing for mobile market
leader Toshiba before joining TI as vice president of personal
productivity products in April.

"TI has made some big jumps [in notebooks]," said Mike McGuire,
analyst for Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif. "The marketing
plans that Steve Lair has put in place are really kicking in."

Lair completely restructured the marketing organization at TI
and added more than 100 people in U.S. sales and marketing.
"We're making a big-time move to get mobile market share,"
said Lair. And new technology coming out soon, such as on-board
telephone capability, and additional multimedia and wireless
functionality, will further propel TI, according to Lair.

The company is also poised to revamp its Extensa value notebook
line in the first quarter. An aggressive push into Pentium
is also expected. Pentium accounted for about 58 percent of
mobile sales for TI in the fourth quarter, said Lair, but by
midyear it will be ubiquitous. The 120MHz-based TravelMate
5200, launched in October, starts at about $5,000. The 6.7
pound product features 8 Mbytes of RAM, a 1.2-Gbyte hard drive,
a built-in 16-bit sound card, an internal speaker and microphone,
interfaces for audio in/out and realtime video with a 10.4
inch active-matrix SVGA color screen.

Lair said VARs will play an important role in pushing TI into
small, medium-size and large businesses in 1996. "It's going
to be a hell of a year," he said.

By The Numbers: The Great 1995 Sell-Through: Seeking Answers

By:
Vadim Zlotnikov

During the past couple of months, there has been extensive discussion
of the PC sell-through during this year's fourth quarter.

This is a particularly important question given the relatively
large inventory position that resellers have taken in anticipation
of strong, Windows 95-driven PC demand. The inclinations to
date have been far from conclusive, but several trends are
beginning to emerge.

The CRN/Sanford Bernstein Survey suggests overall PC availability
remains relatively good, with modest shortages at the high
end of the product line. The levels of excess inventory have
edged up slightly. Roughly two-thirds of resellers expect PC
unit growth during the next three months will be up at least
5 percent when compared with the previous three months.

The key issue here is the relative balance between supply and
demand. Our estimates suggest to clear channel inventory during
the fourth quarter, PC unit growth would need to be in the
20 percent to 22 percent range at the corporate level and 35
percent to 37 percent at the retail level. Through November,
these target levels were close to being met but at the expense
of margins because of promotions.

But we expect U.S. PC growth in 1996 will moderate to the 17
percent to 19 percent range, compared with 23 percent to 24
percent this year. Expectations of slower growth are being
driven primarily by high penetration rates among corporations
and high-income households. While Windows 95 has not been a
failure, it is being sold mainly to high-income households
and small businesses upgrading their PCs. As we look into 1996,
there are few compelling new applications that would induce
a new segment of the market to purchase a PC. Furthermore,
the much touted $500 box that is needed to address the lower
end of the market is unlikely to generate significant volumes
until late 1997 or 1998.

& Co., New York, covering the PC and semiconductor industries.

manufacturers as IBM Corp., Apple Computer Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and U.S. Robotics Inc.

"We're in the process of evaluating what for us is a new medium
before committing to more than three programs. We chose CNBC
because it gives us access to 80 million U.S. homes which include
a lot of influential corporate employees, including [chief
information officers]," said Elek-Tek President Cameron Estes.
"Our objective is to stress the benefits and time saving value
of computers and more importantly to feature and sell products."

To that end, viewers of Computer Wonderland during the course
of the program are encouraged to call for a free Elek-Tek catalog
and coupon book or to place an order. The show itself has presented
vignettes on how the HP Deskjet helped a child find a lost
dog and how a grandmother used a Macintosh Performa as a babysitting
tool. The reseller's corporate thrust was underscored by a
profile of how an employee achieved higher productivity and
a promotion through the use of an IBM ThinkPad.

The 17-year-old, multimillion-dollar reseller, which in addition
to its Skokie headquarters and four Chicago retail outlets
has operations in Denver, Indianapolis and Kansas City, Mo.,
retained Chicago-based KRT Productions Inc. to produce the
series. Once the initial three programs run their course, Elek
Tek will evaluate their success before deciding whether to
continue the Computer Wonderland series, Estes said.

$10,000 Home Page Cracking

By:
MICHAEL KANELLOS

Seattle-ichael Koidahl, president of Seattle's Westwind Computing
Inc., has enough faith in the 8150 Apple Internet server that
he will give $10,000 to anyone who can hack into his.

"What is Netscape [Communications Corp.] offering? A T-shirt?"
he asked.

The $10,000 Macintosh Security Challenge is co-sponsored with
Redmond, Wash.-based integrator ComVista Inc., Bellevue, Wash.
based Internet service provider Digital Forest, and four ISVs.

The challenge has been the three companies' answer to customer
questions about security on the Internet since Oct. 15. At
the same time, it has been a live advertisement for the three
companies.

"In October and [early] November, we had about 4,000 to 5,000
hits. We're probably getting 200 to 250 a day now," said John
Wiederspan, the director of technical services at ComVista.

"We have had four people write us and tell us how they could
break in. We told them, 'Fine,' [but] they haven't yet," he
added.

Koidahl said the idea for the Internet Challenge came about
because customers wanted tangible proof of Internet security.

The three companies also wanted a way to demonstrate their own
skills and products, which complement each other.

Westwind is a high-end Apple reseller specializing in sales,
testing and configuration of hardware and software. ComVista,
on the other hand, acts as a consultant, providing white papers
and hourly consulting to companies interested in mapping out
communications strategies. Digital Forest designs and maintains
home-page sites for those wanting to outsource that function.

Wiederspan added that as much as possible the three use the
same software vendors, including Maxum and StarNine Technologies
Inc.

While working as a consortium divides revenue, it increases
each company's individual flexibility and keeps each concentrated
on its core competency, said Koidahl. Overall, "our philosophy
is to get customers to provide information," he added. Their
joint projects include Internet sites for Alaska Airlines and
Northwest Nickel, a local classified publication.

Naturally, the challenge also has become a testimonial to the
Apple server line, which, Koidahl and Wiederspan pointed out,
remains one of the dominant and most hearty Internet hardware
platforms. Apple is not participating in the test or providing
financial assistance, added Koidahl.

The Macintosh challenge essentially mimics an actual home page,
said Wiederspan. Users can examine on the home page everything
but data contained on one line. Access to that area is permitted
only by password: Break it, and you win $10,000.

So far, the test, which ran until the end of the year, has been
satisfactory on all counts. Sales of Apple Internet servers
at Westwind have been increasing throughout the year, said
Koidahl. Also, 400 local businesspeople attended a recent Internet
seminar sponsored by Westwind.

"For $2,500 you can get an Apple-based server with all the necessary
software," Koidahl said. Although slightly more costly than
some Windows-based servers, the Apple servers have another
selling point: They only require two to three hours to install,
while it might take "40 hours to set up an NT server," he added.

Wiederspan believes the test has shown Apple's equipment can
withstand industrial use. The key, he said, lies in the fact
that the Apple server refuses to accept commands outside the
protocol.

He also hopes the challenge may contribute to the business world's
general acclimation to Internet commerce. "The security aspect
is more of a mind set," he said. "If you wanted 5,000 credit
card numbers, you could go outside of a department store on
trash day."

Visionary forms new group

By:
TIM GRACE

Sunnyvale, Calif.-Visionary Design Systems Inc. formed a separate
systems- and network-integration group to help its core CAD
engineer clientele work with a variety of platforms and applications.

The new group will primarily design custom networks and build
network-management solutions with Hewlett-Packard Co.'s OpenView
product suite, as well as provide system- and network-management
services on an outsourcing basis, said Director Steven Kling.

The $35 million, Sunnyvale-based CAD VAR opted to form a separate
integration group after implementing a successful product-oriented
sideline business in the Bay area, Kling said. "CAD engineers
at our client companies are largely isolated from MIS managers
and departments. They also have a separate set of needs in
terms of network performance and throughput.

"They continually ask us for help because their area of expertise
is design, not network and computer management," he said.

Kling, who joined Visionary Design after a stint as the head
of HP's consulting delivery business in the Western United
States, expects to increase his current seven-member integration
team to between 25 and 30 members by the end of 1996. "Until
then, the logical things for us will be to target our integration
services at our existing mechanical-design environment before
pursuing opportunities in other industries," he said, adding
that the VAR also will leverage its Internet-based ConnectVDS
engineering design transfer system to impart technical information
to users.

Visionary Design launched ConnectVDS in November as a vehicle
through which CAD engineers can exchange files and documents,
conduct research on mechanical engineering and access the World
Wide Web to communicate with vendors and suppliers (CRN, Nov.
6)

"They've already begun communicating with us for information
on how their workstations are networked together and to obtain
such information as how to pass drawing files at faster speeds,"
Kling said.

ConnectVDS, as well as the new systems- and network-integration
group, are key elements to the VAR's Vision 2000 philosophy
of helping customers improve business processes and streamline
information.

"A common challenge for our customers is how to cope with a
mix of different platforms and applications," Kling said. "We
will now be better able to provide subcontractors to implement,
manage and provide ongoing network-performance assessment."

Disc takes its computer-supplies business very personally ...

By:
Pedro Pereira

In an industry where finding a niche has become a necessity
for most distributors, Disc Distributing Corp. executives have
taken pains to have their company appear as anything but conventional.
The distributor's World Wide Web site includes a games zone,
and product promotions often involve food.

The fun does not stop there. Disc's executive vice president,
Carrie Pollare, is compiling data on the company's customers
in an exhaustive research project that includes information
on birthdays and preferred pastimes.

The company's penchant for the unorthodox permeates the way
it does business and the products it sells. Disc, based here,
went into business 10 years ago to distribute computer supplies
and accessories, such as surge protectors, printer toners and
ink cartridges and disks, and has started to branch out into
other types of products.

"We have our niche here and that's supplies and accessories.
I don't want to deal in commodity items. I don't want to make
2 [percent] and 3 percent margins on expensive products," said
Dan Hoffman, Disc founder and president.

The strategy seems to have worked. Hoffman said the privately
held company has grown at rates of 45 percent to 65 percent
yearly and has annual sales of more than $50 million.

Disc employs 70 people and plans to open a second warehouse
to serve the Midwest and East Coast. Sites in Louisville, Ky.,
and Columbus, Ohio, are being considered.

Despite Disc's focus on consumables, Hoffman has plans for the
company to start carrying products it has not traditionally
sold, such as peripherals. So far, the distributor has picked
up Panasonic Corp.'s Power Drive optical disk and CD-ROM drive
as a pilot product for its line-card expansion.

"I don't want to sell hard drives; I want to sell more niche
oriented products," Hoffman said.

Disc sells to resellers, retailers, office-products stores,
mail-order companies and supermarkets; most of its business
goes through the computer channel, Hoffman said.

Pollare, who is Hoffman's sister, said collecting personal information
on customers should help Disc become more attentive to its
resellers. Possible outcomes may include sending customers
birthday cards or arranging a golf weekend, she said.

GBC focuses on Novell's high end

By:
JOHN LONGWELL

Berlin, N.J.-Clarifying an earlier statement that GBC Technologies
Inc. was "easing out of the NetWare business," company President
Norman Some said the distributor is committed to Novell Inc.'s
line.

Some said Novell products will remain a critical line for the
distributor. However, he said GBC is concentrating on selling
Novell's higher-value products that complement its focus on
enterprise connectivity as opposed to commodity-priced NetWare
operating systems.

The networking distributor, which has built its business around
Novell's line, expects Novell's datacommunications products,
GroupWise software and upgrade SKUs to benefit from GBC's technical
support and services. "The VAR's willing to pay for that value
add," Some said.

He said GBC shared Novell's vision of developing NetWare Connect
Services that enable all sorts of devices to connect to a network.
"They have the most robust directory services available, and
that's the key to interconnectivity," according to Some.

Distributors said pricing on NetWare has become aggressive over
the past few quarters because of unauthorized OEM sales into
the channel.

MARKET GROWTH: Projected at more than 100% -- Multimedia Solution
Formula

By:
PEDRO PEREIRA

Boulder, Colo.-Access Graphics Inc. teamed up with InSoft Inc.
to deliver desktop multimedia solutions to VARs in an effort
to take advantage of a market projected to grow at more than
100 percent in coming years.

Access, based here, does not have InSoft products in its line
card, despite its partnership to introduce the collaborative
multimedia vendor's products to the reseller community.

But the products, including videoconferencing and document-sharing
solutions, are compatible with the Sun Microsystems Inc. platform,
from which the distributor derives more than 60 percent of
its revenue.

"The goal is to build the reseller channel for Insoft and Access,"
said Kristen Peterson, manager of Access' TeamWork program,
which oversees the relationship with Insoft, Mechanicsburg,
Pa. Peterson said she will seek to sign up 200 resellers for
the program.

InSoft, which as a reseller of Sun products already has a customer
relationship with the distributor, paid Access a onetime fee
for a six-month contract as a TeamWork participant.

UPS vendors stress network protection role

By:
FRED GARDNER

Boston-As networks and RAID systems expand and make greater
demands on uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes), vendors
have been increasing the versatility of their UPS systems to
allow greater communications capability for IS and other system
managers.

Among the latest of companies to announce greater communications
capability is Liebert Inc., Columbus, Ohio. Liebert's most
recent UPS is the SiteNet MultiPort, a multiplexor module designed
to be integrated with the company's SiteNet family of control
and monitoring software for networkable UPS devices.

"The MultiPort product provides an economical communications
avenue of up to eight computer stations," said Edward K. Feeney,
Liebert's president of North American operations. "This new
level of flexibility gives network administrators that much
more systemwide control through the UPS."

The MultiPort allows multiple ports, represented by computers,
servers or workstations, access to critical information pertinent
to shutdown, including battery condition as well as utility
status. Company officials said any number of MultiPorts can
be daisy chained.

The price of the MultiPort is $675.

A new UPS from Antec Inc., Fremont, Calif., the N+1 line, includes
three series of reliable, redundant supplies that provide automatic,
active fault-tolerant backup power.

The N+1 RPT and RPP series feature hot-swappable capabilities
for multiple DC voltages including +/- 5-volt, 12-volt and
3.3-volt outputs, as well as optional Power Factor Correction.
The lines are intended to solve power-deficiency problems in
mainframes, network and application servers, multiple-processor
workstations and telecom systems, Antec officials said.

The RPT series includes the RPT-100, a standard AT-sized redundant
power supply, configures as a 300 + 300 watts that can be used
as a 600-watt output power supply, and fits directly into any
AT chassis.

The RPP series has hot-swappable capabilities in its 3001 and
3003 modules, which use the RPP-300 + 300 module in their designs.
The 3002 includes a hot-pluggable housing and backplane.

Prices average 20 cents to $1 per watt.

DAX Systems Inc., Pine Brook, N.J., unveiled its first rack
mounted UPS with N+1 redundancy and true load sharing. With
the RSP-500, "the four hot-swappable [500-watt] power modules
can be configured to meet the most demanding integrated voice
response and telephony needs," said Anthony F. Shay, national
sales manager at DAX.

If a module fails, the system's alarms are initiated while the
three remaining modules support the entire electrical load.
The unit also features an integral board that monitors the
fans and data-flow and power-supply performance. It also has
options for auditory, visual and printout alarms.

A fully populated RPS-500 system is priced at $6,135.

Several new UPS models are available from Exide Electronics,
Raleigh, N.C. The latest is the Powerware Prestige 3000VA (voltage
amperes) UPS for medium-size computer networks running from
a standard 120-volt input.

Features include Exide's CellSaver technology which allows the
UPS to accommodate a greater range of power fluctuation without
having to resort to battery-backup power, extending the unit's
battery life significantly, according to officials.

"What this means for network managers, as well as MIS and telecom
professionals, is that they can have all the benefits of true
online technology for only slightly more than they would pay
for lower-performance products," said Doug Milner, director
of product and partner marketing for Exide.

The system is available in plug-and-play and hard-wired configurations.

Its price is $2,299.

MPC 486 slave board unveiled



New York -Technological Artisans Inc. is shipping its MPC 486,
a low-cost, PC-compatible I/O slave board for debugging purposes.

The board, which interfaces to the host motherboard processor
through a large 128-Kbyte block of dual-ported bidirectional
shared memory, can be used with any tool that generates a PC
executable file. Then, by connecting a monitor and keyboard
to the MPC 486, users can run debuggers natively on the board,
company officials said.

The board can also be used to build databases, image recognition,
seismology and medical imaging. "We designed the MPC 486 PC
after an extensive search of the marketplace revealed that
no other board combined the essential elements necessary for
a truly effective I/O slave board," said Daniel Cohm, president
of the New York-based company.

Features include six on-board 12-bit DACs, on-board 2.5-Mbyte
solid-state disk, a 486 25MHz processor (33MHz optional), parallel
I/O and external interrupt support, COM1 and COM2 serial ports,
LPT printer port, realtime clock, floppy and IDE controllers,
and keyboard support. The price is $1,495.

Internet Fever Strikes Client/Server Providers



EDITOR'S NOTE: CRN recently gathered top executives from the
client/server industry for the Second Annual Client/Server
Summit in New York. This is the first installment of excerpts.
Next week: discussion on growth opportunities and vendor strategies.

ONLINE OPPORTUNITIES

LANE: We're very bullish on the Internet. One reason is no one
controls it, and it seems that its growth, its popularity in
what is a very arcane delivery vehicle today and a user interface
could only be made better. It is obviously an opportunity to
change the industry paradigm, which, at least at the client
end, is quickly becoming a monopoly. Obviously, if you are
a large software company you want to see that remain open.

Second, there are a lot of technicians and users coming into
the business now that are more Internet-skilled than anything
else.

MCDOWELL: An area that I think is very interesting is in the
impact this is going to have on small businesses. I think this
somewhat levels the playing field. I was talking to a small
business person the other day who basically sells analyst reports.
It's a very small operation, and they were flabbergasted at
the demand for their service they got by going out to the Internet
and describing in some way what they're doing. Suddenly, the
size of the firm didn't matter; it was how they positioned
it.

KERTZMAN: The Web interface, or what we will eventually extend
the Web interface to be, is probably the best, easiest, most
intuitive user interface that's been developed, and that will
drive the inevitability of these technologies.

WHITE: The biggest market for all of this is going to be inside
companies. They're spending the money, they've got the need
for sales-force automation, customer service, customer support.
That's going to drive a lot of business, big time, in '96 and
'97.

PAPERMASTER: The Internet has become, ultimately, an environment.
It's not a tool. It's like air. Everybody breathes it. The
ultimate winner, who is going to make money on the Internet,
is the customer, because it completely changes the paradigm
of offering new services and new ways to market companies.
I think the real message for the whole technology industry
and certainly for any of the channels or the intermediaries
in the product marketplace-is that it turns the value chain
on its end, and that can either be a tremendous opportunity
or it can be dangerous.

SIMS: We've found in the past few months an enormous [interest
in] the whole area of intranet, so we think that's going to
be a pretty big extension to what's happening in the Internet.
I would say 10 percent to 15 percent of our clients are already
talking about or looking at that.

RAMSEY: If I were an unemployed entrepreneur looking for a new
opportunity in the Internet area, I'd look at providing consulting
services. It's a great opportunity for the reselling community
to add value.

REVENUE PROJECTIONS

TEBBE: There's multiple dimensions: Internet and intranet. That
combination is probably 15 percent to 20 percent of our business.
I think it'll grow another 50 percent next year, to 30 percent
to 33 percent of our business.

MCDOWELL: I'd like anybody to be able to sit down and calculate
Internet revenue. Certainly I'd ask, along with that, about
profit.

RAMSEY: We've probably spent more developing our Internet site
than we made in profit in selling Internet products to date,
but that's OK. I finally, in my own mind, concluded what the
Internet means to us as a service provider and a seller of
products. Certainly it's a way to interface with our customers.
As a supplier of product, we're principally selling servers.

JACOBSEN: We certainly are making a lot of revenue and a lot
of profit off it today by virtue of MCI being a major provider
of backbone, as well as an access provider. We're making money
on the Internet today hand over fist. The Internet gives us
what we've all been looking for, data dial tone, but for us
it's also an enabler. We look at IP as another transport option
with a series of telecommunications products and services.

WHITE: I think [our Internet revenue is in the] single digits
today. Internet-related revenue will be pretty high next year
30 percent to 50 percent. The three [relational database suppliers]
are going to do a lot of database business.

KERTZMAN: If somebody is using the client/server architecture
on a TCP/IP network that's the core backbone network, then
you can say that's an Internet platform. So I think it will
be hard to differentiate what's Internet-related revenue and
what's not. And, in a sense, everything will have some components
to that.

SIMS: I would say it's nominal business for us today. It could
represent 4 [percent] or 5 percent of our business next year
in the intranet.

LANE: Even though it's been reported that we are investing a
lot of money-relative to what we invest in R&D and database
and applications-this is a relatively small investment. But
it can be tremendously leveraged, and so the opportunity is
huge.

NETWORK COMPUTERS

KERTZMAN: I don't think that in corporate desktops

you will see a movement to these Internet computers or Internet
terminals until every application that every user needs to
run is runnable in that metaphor. And nobody wants two devices
on their desktops. I think the market, however, for mobile
and home devices is probably where these very light Internet
terminals will find a future.

MCDOWELL: We don't see the PC as we know it today-that is, a
good deal of horsepower and maybe more on the desktop-going
away in the near term. While we believe that the debate over
how big or small the desktop will be is probably still a bit
of an open debate, if there are smaller devices, Microsoft
will want to hopefully develop products that add value in that
arena. But we see a major opportunity to leverage the existing
and continuing growth in PC-based systems today.

LANE: We feel there will be a low-cost Internet or network-access
device that does not require all of the hardware and software
that a PC [has] today. There is a large gap between the telephone
and the PC in terms of economics. If Intel and Compaq are the
first ones to build NCs, it probably is going to happen sooner.
Oracle is not going to build NCs. But we do have an interest
in seeing a lot of different client devices out there. We want
everybody to have multiple client devices because that will
generate server revenue.

WHITE: [Regarding] the network computer, or the NC, as [Oracle
Chairman] Larry [Ellison] called it, . . . in my view, the
'NC' stands for 'no chance.' I think the real opportunity is
going to be driven by the combination of a network computer
and a phone and probably will be deployed by the telephony
based companies. It's driving a lot of new partners, a lot
of business opportunities, a lot of hype like the NC, but I
think it will cause a lot of anxious moments and sell none
on the business side.

PAPERMASTER: The Internet computer violates a fundamental premise
of personal computing and even client/server computing, which
is having ownership, if you will, of the resources it takes
to control your own destiny.

SIMS: The discussion now is: How slim is the client going to
be? You know it's not going to go to nothing. I think we've
been saying that for 25 years. We all thought that if we could
cut $200 off the cost of a terminal, we were going to have
this big market. I think the client might potentially slim
up a little bit, but I don't think that is permanent.

MICROSOFT'S INTERNET ROLE

PAPERMASTER: I think you can look at the hits Microsoft is taking
in the marketplace, at least from a perception standpoint.
That's because of time compression. The thought there is: How
can they react fast enough? Now for that statement to be even
made at this point is pretty phenomenal.

LANE: The Internet opens up the issue of the client. And that's
why I think there's so much focus on this debate. But some
of these broad-sweeping statements [that] Microsoft has lost
this debate . . . are ridiculous. I don't believe it will be
leaderless, though. There will be leaders that basically build
execution ability, have good products, mass distribution, get
the application builders. Microsoft has the best chance to
win that game.

WHITE: I don't think Microsoft lost the lead. They didn't have
it. Nobody had the lead.

Top 25 Executives -- Steve Ballmer: The Net is growing... How can a 
VAR benefit?



EDITOR'S NOTE: Steve Ballmer, executive vice president of Microsoft
Corp., Redmond, Wash., was among CRN's Top 25 Executives in
1995. His column is part of an ongoing series from those executives.

The Internet is no longer a possibility, it's a reality. What
is still open to question is how fast and how far the Internet
will grow-and how VARs can benefit from that growth.

In our business model for the Internet, a diverse and densely
populated world of Solution Providers, resellers, distributors,
content publishers and other third-party providers must bring
the pieces of the Internet together-including systems integration,
support and training-in order to support corporate Internet
users.

There is room here both for major providers-such as Digital,
EDS and Andersen Consulting-as well as for the 10,000 other
Solution Providers that design, install and service computer
networks and software. Many of these companies correctly see
the corporate Internet market as the greatest opportunity they
have and are eager to help their customers build the infrastructure
to exploit it.

The time for these independent providers to act is now, because
the Internet finally has a critical mass of users. The Internet
also has some limitations and weaknesses-but that critical
mass of users actually mitigates the weaknesses in a very important
way.

The thousands of independent providers in the technology community
now have a powerful financial incentive to jump in and address
whatever limits they perceive because the Internet finally
represents an extraordinary commercial opportunity, as well
as a technological one.

A tremendous opportunity lies in equipping and supporting corporate
customers with the hardware and software they need to do business
in the new Internet marketplace-business that includes communicating,
selling, order handling, invoicing and financial processing,
distribution, fulfillment and customer service.

But opportunity is not limited to the corporations already on
the Internet, because many more will join them. The Internet
will change the economics of doing business, lowering the overall
cost of business entry and raising the potential return on
investment as companies gain access to larger markets at little
or no additional cost. That will bring more players to the
field-and more potential customers for a VAR's products and
services.

New types of providers will appear to service these corporate
customers, and resellers will be among them. We expect that
corporations and consumers alike will be attracted to a single
source for most or all of their Internet-service needs.

In addition to Internet online services, Solution Providers
and other resellers, many companies will have to work together
to make this model a reality. Network operators are one example.
Systems manufacturers are another. They must provide the multiprocessors
and the fault-tolerant systems, and, in many cases, they must
integrate the software.

Software vendors are also crucial. There is tremendous opportunity
for third-party software developers. Web servers need new applications
for databases, commerce, workgroups and so on.

On the client side, third-party development will enhance and
extend the basic operating system and integrated browser. On
the bandwidth side of the model, expect to see success for
both of today's midband technologies, ISDN and PC-cable modem.
Growth on one side will spur competition and innovation on
the other. But do not count on a revolution in broadband technologies
anytime soon.

The development of the Internet may well prove to be analogous
to the evolution of the original IBM PC. When it appeared in
1981, there was a lot about it that was arbitrary, limited
and problematic.

Yet for the past two decades, the evolution of that architecture
has driven most of our industry. The Internet is likely to
be the same way. Parts are still missing, but clearly it will
evolve into the ultimate wide-area communications network-and
into a wonderful opportunity for as many resellers and third
parties as have benefited from the PC revolution.

ShadowRAM



Dino is dead. The news hit hard for every person deluded enough
to consider him/herself an honorary Rat Packer. My early Comdex
years were spent trying to act like one of Robin's Seven Hoods.
Dean sang, he danced, he cracked me up. Repeatedly. And he
made it look so easy.

There's not really a Rat Pack in our biz. You could stretch
it to say the Redmond boys-Gates, Ballmer, Higgins, Maritz,
et al., have a shot. But only one of them (guess which) looks
like he's having much fun. . . . But with all of Bill's new
Hollywood pals-Katzenberg, Spielberg, et al.-maybe they could
at least pretend to have a sense of humor.

Gates must not have enjoyed The Paper of Record's critique of
his recent book, described by The New York Times reviewer Joseph
Nocera as "bland and tepid." And billion-dollar Bill must be
getting tired of having his literary works compared with Howard
Stern's.

"Ostensibly offering readers Mr. Gates' upbeat views on the
coming "information highway," . . . 'The Road Ahead' is in
fact little more than a positioning document sold in book form
with accompanying CD-ROM and designed mainly to advance the
interests of Microsoft Corp.," Nocera wrote. Gates promoting
Microsoft and charging people for it? That's what makes America
great!

Okay, already. So I got the Mannheim Steamroller guy's name
wrong. . . . It's Chip Davis, not Chip Douglas. So you've never
had a "My Three Sons" flashback?

Some Lotus types-mostly old-timers who have left the nest-finally
gave former CEO Jim Manzi a send-off during the holiday week
at a tony Cambridge restaurant. Highlights included a Top 10
list of what Manzi should do now. No. 1 was spend his full
time on trying to get into The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
That's "The" Country Club, not "A" country club. It ain't easy
getting into that swank establishment, even with the gazillions
Manzi has stashed. The Club is allegedly the first such establishment
in the United States and Manzi certainly will be in the minority.

Entex found a way to cut year-end costs and, in the process,
make Mr. Potter from Bedford Falls look downright jolly. Entex
sent out holiday cards with postage due. Nice work boys.

A Novell reseller informs us, in an E-mail dripping with sarcasm,
that he was shocked! Shocked! to encounter snags putting NetWare
4.1 on a Windows 95 workstation. The customer opted for MS
Office 95, which the VAR dutifully put on the server and then
tried to do a node install at the workstations. This went well
until the install process started to create icons for the files
copied down to the workstation. At that point, a dialog box
popped up with the message: "Setup Error 991 Object 2742."
The VAR called Redmond and was told to switch to the Microsoft
client for NetWare, install the software and switch back. Said
the VAR, "I know Microsoft wouldn't detect the NetWare client
and generate a bogus error message, but it sure does seem odd."

Recently, the following undocumented Windows 95 error-codes
were posted on the Net. (Note to Microsoft: It's a joke!)

WinErr: 001 Windows loaded-System in danger; WinErr: 002 No
error-Yet; WinErr: 003 Dynamic linking error-Your mistake is
now in every file; WinErr: 004 Erroneous error-Nothing is wrong;
WinErr: 005 Multitasking attempted-System confused.

Well, as Dino said, everybody loves somebody sometime, but we
love hot tips all the time. . . . Go ahead all you Rat Packer
wanna-bes-send your hot items to shadowram@mcimail.com; fax
to (617) 487-7599; or call (800) 521-DIME.
