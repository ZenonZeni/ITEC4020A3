<A NAME = "facts"><H2>FACTS ABOUT SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
What is severe mental illness?
<P>
Severe mental illnesses are biological brain diseases that can
critically interfere with a person's ability to think, feel and
relate to other people and the environment.
<P>
The U.S. Congress Office of Technology and Assessment, in
September, reported "evidence that biological factors are
involved in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder...other
areas of research provide evidence about correlated biological
factors and suggest testable hypotheses to causation."
<P>
What are some of the more disabling mental illnesses?  How common
are they?
<P>
Schizophrenia is a brain disease that often strikes young people
between the ages of 16 and 25.  A debilitating thought disorder,
schizophrenia causes some people to experience delusions and
auditory and visual hallucinations.
<P>
They cannot distinguish what is real from what is not.  Specific
causes are yet unknown, but are believed to be biological,
sometimes involving genetic or viral factors.
<P>
Depressive disorders -- including major depression and bipolar
disorder (manic-depressive illness) -- are very common and range
widely in severity.
<P>
In any given year, about 5 million Americans, or 2.8 percent of
the adult population, suffer from severe mental illnesses.
<P>
The number one reason for hospital admissions nationwide is
psychiatric disorder.  At any moment, almost 21 percent of all
hospital beds are filled by people with mental illness.
<P>
Severe mental illnesses are more common than diabetes, cancer or
heart disease.
<P>
How many children and adolescents have severe mental illnesses?
<P>
Children, although often misdiagnosed, suffer from the same
severe mental illnesses -- schizophrenia, depressive disorders,
OCD and panic disorder -- as adults do.
<P>
In any given year, 3.2 percent of children and adolescents
between the ages of 9 and 17 are diagnosed with a severe mental
illness.
<P>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is a common
behavioral disorder which affects 3-5 percent of the nation's
youth under 13.
<P>
A conservative estimate is that a total of 12 percent or 7.5
million of the country's 63 million youths under age 18 have
mental, behavioral or developmental disorders.
<P>
Only about a fifth of the 7.5 million children and adolescents
who need mental health treatment receive it.
<P>
What are the costs of severe mental illness?
<P>
In 1990, mental illnesses cost the nation an estimated $74
billion, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
<P>
Treating severe mental illnesses cost the nation approximately
$27 billion, including long-term nursing home care.
<P>
One quarter of all Social Security Disability payments are for
individuals with severe mental illnesses.
<P>
How are persons with severe mental illnesses stigmatized?
<P>
People with mental illness are feared or stereotyped as
dangerous, aggressive and violent.  In fact, they are more likely
to be isolated, passive and withdrawn.  Often they are blamed for
their illness.
<P>
They are denied opportunities to rebuild their lives in the
community because of discrimination in housing, employment and
health insurance coverage.
<P>
Is there hope for persons suffering from severe mental illness?
<P>
Yes!  Through research, scientists have made great advances in
understanding the nature of severe mental illnesses in the last
ten years.  The development of sophisticated scanning devices
which take "pictures" of the brain bring us closer to
understanding the role of brain structure and chemistry in the
causation of mental illness.
<P>
Genetic mapping may determine other causes.  Research into new
treatments have significantly improved the lives of people who
now suffer from these devastating illnesses.
<P>
The treatment success rate for schizophrenia is 60 percent, 80
percent for bipolar disorder and 65 percent for major depression.
Comparatively, the success rate for treatments of heart disease
ranges from 41-52 percent. 
<P>
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is a grassroots
self-help, support and advocacy organization of families, friends
and people suffering from severe mental illnesses.
<P>
Dedicated to improving the lives of people with severe,
biological brain diseases, NAMI works on the national, state and
local level through 140,000 members and 1,000 affiliates to
provide education about severe mental illnesses and to support
increased funding for research and quality services.

<A NAME = "famil"><H2>FAMILIES OF OCD SUFFERERS SUFFER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A survey of 450 families with someone suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) revealed that "depression, marital distress, hardship to siblings, and disruption of family personal and social life are part of the overall devastation wrought by this illness." 
<P>
Conducted by the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation, the study asked how having a OCD relative affected family life and how families coped.  Respondents reported that, to cope, they relied on lectures, reading materials, and sympathetic friends and relatives.  Almost 60 percent of family members used individual therapy to help deal with an OCD situation. 
<P>
Eighty percent of the survey respondents said that disruption of family life was a result of the disorder.  Three-fourths of family members had difficulty with their OCD relative's self-involvement, and 70 percent were bothered by the relative's lack of motivation.  About 63 percent were concerned about inconsiderate behavior, excessive arguing, and being drawn into ritualizing behavior by OCD relatives; and 66 percent cited OCD-related financial difficulties as a problem. 
<P>
Concerns of family members included dealing with the relative's lost potential; the uncertainty about what would happen to the OCD relative when the caretakers were gone; the difficulty of enjoying life while the OCD sufferer was in pain; the envy of normal families; and anger at relatives.

<P>

<A NAME = "gene"><H2>GENE FOR MANIC DEPRESSION</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A gene, or possibly two, that could contribute to as many as one in four cases of manic depression may be on a region of chromosome 18, according to a study of 395 members of 22 families by Wade H. Berrettini and colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. 
<P>
Manic depression or recurrent depression afflicted 167 participants in the study; in eight of the families, similar genetic variations on chromosome 18 were identified.  Although this means almost two-thirds of the families had no evidence of involvement by chromosome 18, that alone would not rule out the locations:  Most scientists seeking the genetic basis of manic-depressive illness agree that more than one genetic miscue probably can set the state for, or cause, the disorder. 
<P>
The study, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (June 21), noted two genes worthy of suspicion out of the approximately 100 genes on chromosome 18.  One codes for a protein that plays a specific part in chemical signal reception; the other is involved in stress hormone production, a physiological function that has been shown to go into overdrive in both depression and manic depression.
