 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STRESS </H2>

<P>   In today's fast paced, stressful times it is no wonder that tranquilizers are the largest selling category of prescription drugs sold in America.
  The lack of physical exercise, especially when combined with the lack of a nutritious diet is thought by most experts to be the biggest contributor to nervousness, anxiety and depression.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EXERCISE</H2>
<P>   Exercise is our first line of defense against tension, anxiety and depression. Exercising increases circulation to all of the organs of the body.  Supplying them with more oxygen and nutrition helps the muscles relax. In addition, it lowers the build-up of metabolic end products and we feel better.  However, it is difficult for most people to stick with exercise programs.  It takes real dedication but does pay off over the long term.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIET</H2>
<P>   Diet is one of the real culprits responsible for anxiety. Most people eat too much, and in addition, their diets do not contain the sufficient nutrients.  Our modern "convenience diets" are high in calories and low in vitamins and minerals. The B vitamins and the minerals, calcium and magnesium, are very important for the immune system, yet the diets of many people are deficient in these nutrients.</P>
<P>  The high consumption of sugar is probably the leading dietary contributor to nervousness and anxiety. Over a period of time this can lead to a condition known as hypoglycemia, which is very prevalent today. Hypoglycemia is a condition where our blood sugar levels get dangerously low at times.   This, too, contributes to nervousness, tension, restlessness and even depression.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> STIMULANTS</H2>
<P>  Quite often, people plagued with hypoglycemia, which is commonly expressed in tiredness and nervousness, resort to caffeine, nicotine, drugs, and sugar when they get the blues. However, these things merely aggravate the situation further, and so many get into a vicious cycle, usually without even knowing it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE</H2>
<P>   It is wise to eat a quality diet with adequate amounts of all the food groups. Make certain that your diet contains a good cross section of all the vitamins and minerals, especially the B vitamins, calcium and magnesium. You may consider supplementing with a well rounded foundational multiple product like <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A> and <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CAL MAG PLUS</A>. In addition, the Life Plus natural herbal blend TRANQUILON may fit your program as well. Thousands of people like it because it does not produce the side effects of drowsiness, tiredness, etc.</P>
<P>  The TRANQUILON formula contains ten natural herbs that work together for their synergistic effect including Valerian Root, Passionflower, Hops, Black Cohosh, Wood Betony, Chamomile, Lady's Slipper, Cayenne, Chlorophyll and Skullcap.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  TRANQUILON is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE TRANQUILON</H2>
<P>  Most people take one or two tablets, two to three times throughout the day, which is usually adequate. However, three tablets can be taken each time if desired. Some individuals take it at bedtime by itself, or with <A HREF="mmel.htm">SOMNISET</A>. Other Life Plus products synergistic with <A HREF="mtranq.htm">TRANQUILON</A> are <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, <A HREF="mcandy.htm">CANDY CAL</A>, <A HREF="mmag.htm"> MAGNESIUM PLUS</A>, <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CALMAG PLUS</A>. <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A> and <A HREF="mmagicf.htm">INNER MAGIC F</A> for women and <A HREF="mmagicm.htm">INNER MAGIC M </A>for men.</P>
