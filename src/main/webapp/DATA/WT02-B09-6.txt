<H4>CRITIQUE OF TAX COMMISSIONS</H4>
<P>Tax commissions are often the source of key policy recommendations with respect to the design of our system of public finance. HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS explores the prevailing economic, social and political assumptions which guide modern day tax commissions. This critical evaluation, by Ottawa lawyer and writer Francis K. Peddle, focuses on tax philosophy and principles. It illustrates the frequent misapplication of tax principles as well as their often contradictory and inconsistent juxtaposition. The particular analysis in this book has relevance for all tax commissions.</P>

<H4>ONTARIO FAIR TAX COMMISSION</H4>
<P>In December, 1993 the Ontario Fair Tax Commission issued its final Report entitled Fair Taxation in a Changing World. The Report was the first major review of the tax system in Ontario in 25 years. The Fair Tax Commission spent $8.6 million and conducted an extensive consultation program with the public. It also confidently persuaded itself that its Report would form the basis of tax policy development well into the future. Although the Report feigns objectivity, its recommendations are driven by political ideology and are often based on poor and incomplete research. The Report's major recommendation with respect to property taxation would have a highly regressive, unfair and counterproductive effect on the tax system and the economy in Ontario.</P>

<H4>CONTENTS</H4>
<P>HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS contains an in depth analysis of the Report of the Fair Tax Commission with a view to exposing many of its incoherent pronouncements on property, income and sales taxation. Part One examines tax principles and looks at the untenable assumptions underlying the "tax mix" philosophy of public revenue generation. The false opposition of sales and income taxes is also discussed. Part Two undertakes a detailed evaluation of the Report and focuses on local government finance. Particular attention is paid to the basis for property assessment in Ontario. Why the Fair Tax Commission choose to avoid recommending two tier property taxation will be of special interest to readers. Part Three deals with property tax appeals and makes some suggestions that are directed at fundamental reform.</P>

<H4>CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVES</H4>
<P>This book relies on the economic philosophy of Henry George to draw its conclusions as to why the work of modern day tax commissions is futile and results in negative consequences with respect to the design of tax systems. A tax system based on the principles of Henry George's economic philosophy moves us towards fairness and justice in the distribution of property and income. In doing so we come closer to fairness and justice in taxation.</P>

<H4>CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION</H4>
<P>Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of society and brought to a halt social progress. Not infrequently the end result of arbitrary and punitive forms of taxation is social turmoil and revolution.
By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and extending a helping hand to the needy. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line.</P>

<P>The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves.</P>

<P>The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean urban environments.</P>
