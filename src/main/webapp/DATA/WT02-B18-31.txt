<H2>Pulsar Internacional to Donate $10 Million<BR>

	<CENTER><H3>Contribution to Support the Preservation of Mexican Forests
</H3></CENTER>

	<P>MONTERREY, MEXICO -- Pulsar Internacional, SA of C.V., one of Mexico's largest companies, announced today its plans to donate $10 million over the next five years to Conservation International (CI), a group dedicated to the conservation of the world's natural resources.  The money donated by Pulsar will support the preservation of Mexican forests in the Selva Lacandona region of the Mexican state of Chiapas.  This donation represents one of the largest private gifts ever for conservation efforts.  

	<P>Considered by the Mexican government to be the highest conservation priority in the country, the Selva Lacandona has been increasingly threatened by destructive practices such as clear cutting and over-grazing.  The region is exceeded only by Brazil, Colombia and Indonesia in its biological richness and represents an important conservation opportunity to preserve Mexico's natural resources.

	<P>"At Pulsar, we feel that the conservation of Mexico's natural resources is of the utmost importance, and we continually seek opportunities to improve our environment as well as our country's prosperity," said Alfonso Romo, Chairman and CEO of Pulsar Internacional.  "As Mexican citizens, it is our responsibility to find solutions to the environmental issues that face the communities in which we operate."


	<P>A team of engineers and scientists from Pulsar and Conservation International will spearhead the conservation projects focused on the Selva Lacandona region.  Pulsar's research and development center, Centro Internacional de Investigaci¢n Agropecuaria (CIICA), will establish experimental areas within the Selva Lacandona to identify agricultural techniques that will improve the quality and yields of trees and crops cultivated by the local farmers.

	<P>Pulsar's contribution will fund CI's programs that teach Selva Lacandona farmers how to support themselves through means that are conservation friendly.  Farmers will learn to work the land in a buffer zone surrounding the forest with a particular focus on cultivating bamboo, or "hule," African palms and ornamental plants.  

	<P>"We are delighted that Pulsar recognizes the Selva Lacandona as one of the world's most vital areas in need of natural resource conservation," said Peter Seligmann, Chairman and CEO of Conservation International.  "Pulsar's contribution will greatly expand CI's programs that involve local residents with our ongoing efforts to protect the environment."

	<P>Pulsar's donation extends the company's ongoing commitment to the protection of the world's natural resources and wildlife.  Pulsar currently plants Guadua angustifolia trees in Tabasco to protect the endangered Mangle tree.  The new trees have a greater yield and are used to supply housing in the region.  And Pulsar's organization, Aquilla and Ara, is devoted to the protection of endangered species of birds, including the Mexican eagle, the macaw and the parrot.

	<P>CI is an international organization dedicated to conserving the world's biological diversity.  In more than 20 countries in which it works, CI brings together all stakeholders -- scientists, local and indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, government officials -- to create realistic conservation strategies, including economic development projects that sustain the local environment.

	<P>Created by Alfonso Romo in 1981, the Pulsar family of companies thrives on an entrepreneurial spirit that fosters a global strategic vision and commitment to dynamic leadership and growth.  With its roots in Monterrey, Mexico, Pulsar's companies generate sales in more than 110 countries around the world, with laboratory and production facilities in over 36 countries.  Pulsar employs 25,000 corporate employees and 66,000 workers indirectly through its agricultural business.  Its businesses include financial services, agriculture, agrobiotechnology, packaging, consumer goods distribution and new ventures.  In 1996, Pulsar's global sales will exceed $2 billion.
