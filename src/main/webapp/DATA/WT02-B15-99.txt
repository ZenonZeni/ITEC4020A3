        Relationship Guidelines</h3>
        </font></center><br>
        <i>The following article has been reprinted courtesy of
        The Virginia Board of Medicine.</i><p> The Drug Control
        Act requires a physician to have a bonafide
        physician/patient relationship with a person before
        writing a prescription for a controlled substance. In
        addition to the problem of drug abuse/diversion, the
        Board continues to see cases where a physician prescribes
        for a person with whom he does not have a true
        physician/patient relationship. Therefore, the Board has
        determined to reprint the following guidelines. </p>
        <p> <font color="#800000"><b>Physician/Patient
        Relationship Guidelines</font></b> </p>
        <p> The Board of Medicine respects the professional
        integrity of physicians and recognizes that most
        physicians in Virginia comply with the law. However, drug
        abuse/diversion continues to be a very serious problem
        with has caused the Board concern and occupies
        considerable investigatory time. </p>
        <p> After a lengthy study, the Board, on November 23,
        1985, adopted the following guidelines to define a valid
        physician/patient relationship to assist Board
        investigators in drug abuse-diversion cases. The Board
        believes it is important to remind physicians of these
        guidelines, so we are reprinting them. These guidelines
        do not carry the force of law or regulation, but are
        intended as guidelines only. </p>
        <p> <font color="#800000"><b>A valid physician/patient
        relationship is documented by the presence of medical
        records and should contain the following as outlined:</font></b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An appropriate history and physical or mental
                examination for the patient's chief complaint as
                appropriate to the specialty; </li>
            <li>Diagnostic tests when indicated; </li>
            <li>A working diagnosis; </li>
            <li>Treatment; and </li>
            <li>Documentation by date of all prescriptions
                written for drugs, with name of medication,
                strength, dosage, quantity and number of refills.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <font color="#800000"><b>In addition, &quot;Guidelines
        for treatment of immediate family members of a
        physician,&quot; were adopted. They are as follows:</font></b>
        <ul>

                be reserved for minor illnesses, temporary or
                emergency situations; </li>
            <li>Appropriate consultation should be obtained for
                the management of major or extended periods of

            <li>No Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substances
                should be given or prescribed except in emergency
                situations; and </li>
            <li>Records should be maintained of written
