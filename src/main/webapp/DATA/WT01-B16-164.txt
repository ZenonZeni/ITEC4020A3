Metabolism</B></FONT>
<P>Men are born with all the ingredients for burning fat through exercise.
These are lypolytic enzymes, more muscle mass, and more mitocondria. Lypolytic
enzymes help in the release of fat from the fat cell. &nbsp;Mitocondria are
the "powerhouses" of the cell. They convert calories to heat and water.
<P>
<P>Women are born with all the ingredients for storing fat. These are lypogenic
enzymes, less muscle mass, and less mitocondria. Lypogenic enzymes promote
the storing of fat.
<P>These are the reasons why men immediately lose fat with any exercise program.
They lose it quicker than women do and do not gain it back as easily.
<P>
<P>Women need lypolytic enzymes, more muscle mass and mitochondria. They
also need oxygen and time.
<P>So...
<P>1. You need moderate exercise with a constant supply of oxygen to stimulate
lypolytic enzymes.
<P>2. You need the lypolytic enzymes to release fat.
<P>3. You need at least 45 minutes for the oxygen to stimulate the lipolytic
enzymes and release a significant amount of fat.
<P>4. You need to work your muscles of the buttocks and thighs to burn the
fat that is released from the fat cell.
<P>5. You need mitochondria and oxygen in your muscles to burn the fat.
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Fat-Burning Exercises for Women</B></FONT>
<P>1. Choose an aerobic exercise. One that uses the major muscle groups of
the buttocks and thighs. It should be a non-stop, rhythmic movement.
<P>2. It should be of moderate intensity. It is not necessary to get out
of breath. Oxygen is the key to releasing fat from the fat cells and burning
fat in the muscle cells.
<P>3. It should last a minimum of 45 minutes. It takes 20 to 30 minutes to
activate the lipolytic enzymes to release fat.
<P>4. Exercise a minimum of 3 times per week.
<P>5. Stimulate your muscle mass and mitochondria. Anerobic exercise will
increase your muscle mass and increase your mitochondria. Using weights is
an example of &nbsp;an anerobic exercise.
