<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 217</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The Hague Declaration<BR>
on the atmosphere</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Declaration of the Hague calls upon all states to participate in the 
development of <A HREF = "fs250.html">a framework 
convention on climate change</A>. </B>The Declaration was issued by a conference of 
heads of state and government convened in the Hague in March 1989 at the initiative of 
the Dutch, French, and Norwegian  governments. Because a number of major countries 
were not invited, the resulting declaration cannot claim to reflect the opinion of the world 
community.  Among the states that were not invited were the US, the USSR, China, 
Belgium, and Greece. The United Kingdom declined to attend.<P>
<B>The Declaration emphasizes the need for new institutional mechanisms.</B> It 
advocates "a new approach, through the development of new principles of international 
law including more effective decision-making and enforcement mechanisms", to counter 
the unprecedented challenge to the atmosphere. The conference participants discussed the 
need for an institution within the framework of the UN that would have the main 
responsibility for combating further global warming. After some debate, the question of 
whether this should be achieved by creating a new institution or whether existing UN 
bodies, notably the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), should be 
strengthened, was left open.<P>
<B>The Declaration also spelled out specific features of the proposed new 
institution. </B>The signatories pledged to promote the following ideas:<P>
	The institution should have the responsibility to combat global warming and  should be 
empowered to make effective decisions, even if unanimous agreement has not been 
reached.<P>
	This institution should be responsible for undertaking the necessary studies, for which it 
should be granted appropriate information. In addition, it should promote the exchange 
of information and technology transfer. It should develop standards and then monitor 
states’ compliance.<P>
 	Disputes regarding the institution’s decisions should be decided by the   International 
Court of Justice.<P>
	Countries for whom measures to protect the atmosphere are a special burden should be 
compensated early and equitably.<P>
	Legal instruments, including institutional and financial mechanisms, need to be    
developed to provide a foundation for application of these principles.<P>
