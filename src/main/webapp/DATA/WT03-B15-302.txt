<H1>Europe's Cities Restructure to Face Global Competition</H1></CENTER>
<P>ERECO, the grouping of leading European economic research institutes, today
publishes its annual report <I>European Regional Prospects</I>, containing
forecasts for 39 major cities and over 200 European regions up to the year 2000.</P>
<P>The report identifies trends and strategies across Europe's cities that
reflect the need for each city to improve its `offer' in the face of a wider
field of competition than in the past. These include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>redeveloping old industrial sites</LI>
<LI>improving local and international transport links</LI>
<LI>developing strategic planning authorities</LI></UL>
<P>However, the ability to invest is constrained by tight public finances, and
attempts to set up authorities with a wider remit for strategic planning have
suffered setbacks in the past year.</P>
<H2>Old Industrial Sites Transformed</H2>
<P>As industry moves out, cities are taking advantage of the sites released to
transform them into competitive locations for the high value added services in
which their future lies.  In the west of <I>Paris</I>, a major European
hospital (the Georges Pompidou hospital) is being built on the former Citro&euml;n
site in the 15th arrondissement.  The former industrial area of Boulogne
Billancourt, the 15th arrondissement, and Issy les Moulineaux is fast turning
into a media quarter: TF1 and Canal Plus television are already based there and
France t&eacute;l&eacute;vision may join them in the longer term.  <I>Torino</I>
presents a similar example: the former Fiat city-centre premises of Lingotto are
being transformed into offices, a major exhibition space and a conference
centre.  IBM has moved its Torino headquarters there.  From spring 1996, a
retail commercial centre with around 80 shops, will be open, while by 1997 part
of the university and the laboratories of the polytechnic are expected to
relocate to Lingotto.</P>
<P><I>Milano</I> has several projects to redevelop former industrial areas,
including `Tecnocity', covering 680,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> on the former Pirelli
site at Bicocca in the north-east of the city.  The project, due to be completed
by 1998, will provide a site for part of the new State University of Milano,
headquarters for several companies including Pirelli, a conference centre, and
housing accommodation.  The flagship of <I>Lille</I>'s transformation remains
the Euralille business centre, but the city also has initiatives to redevelop
old industrial areas.  These include a new university faculty on the 35,000 m<SUP>2</SUP>
site of the old Leblan spinning mill, to be opened in time for the 1996/97
academic year and expected to bring life back to the `quartier des Moulins'
where unemployment is above 23%.  Another example is the Eurot&eacute;l&eacute;port
recently opened at Roubaix and aimed at attracting firms whose activities depend
on high- quality telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
<P>Just as former manufacturing sites are being transformed into service
centres, several cities are redeveloping parts of their docks or waterfront
areas.  The development of Canary Wharf in <I>London</I>'s docklands is a
well-known example.  Others include the major Eurom&eacute;diterran&eacute;e
project covering 310 ha on <I>Marseille</I>'s harbour front, with an investment
of FFr1.7bn spread over five years from 1997.  The first stage includes new
university premises and housing redevelopment, while in the longer term the aim
is to attract high value added service activities.  On a smaller scale, <I>Dublin</I>'s
International Financial Services Centre continues to attract new firms, <I>Lisboa</I>
has plans to redevelop areas close to the Tejo for residential and business
uses, and the <I>Cardiff</I> Bay development continues to attract inward
investment.  In
<I>Rotterdam</I> and <I>Hamburg</I> the emphasis has been on developing
further logistics and processing activities to take advantage of the successful
ports.  <I>Barcelona</I> is seeking to build on the rapid growth of its port to
make the city the major logistics centre for southern Europe, handling trade
between the EU and north Africa and the Far East.  Its Llobregat Delta plan
involves the enlargement of the port, the building of a new rail terminal and
the expansion of the airport with a new cargo centre.</P>
<H2>More Competitive Transport Infrastructure</H2>
<P>In many cities, future competitiveness is threatened by pressure on existing
transport links, both local and international.  In the Cohesion Fund countries
(Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain), cities are still addressing the problems
of urban growth with policies that include major road improvements, a strategy
not generally favoured in the richer cities where physical capacity constraints
typically require measures to ration road use and promote public transport.</P>
<H3>Cohesion Fund Cities</H3>
<P><I>Dublin</I> is addressing the problems of its recent rapid growth and the
lack of a convenient bypass by constructing the Dublin Ring Road.  While the
northern part of the road is nearing completion, problems over land acquisition
have so far blocked action on the southern part of the scheme.  Traffic growth
within the city has also made congestion problems more severe.
<I>Lisboa</I>'s regional authorities are implementing much-needed major
improvements in transport infrastructure, including ring roads with expressways
to the city centre, an enlarged underground railway, a transport interchange for
urban and national road and rail systems, and the Vasco da Gama 12 km bridge
over the Tejo to be opened in 1998.  In <I>Athina</I> the major works in
progress are improvements to the road network and construction of the metro. The
metro is scheduled to be completed at the end of 1998, but indications are that
this target will not be met.  The new airport at Spata (financed with support
from the European Investment Bank) has also been subject to delays.  To address
the problem of urban congestion, Athina's municipal authorities have taken
control of urban public transport, banned cars from the commercial centre and
reserved one lane for public transport on the main access routes to the city.</P>
<H3>Cities in the Richer Countries</H3>
<P>Many of the major cities in the more developed economies are undertaking
transport infrastructure improvements aimed typically at improving either local
public transport or international links.  In <I>Paris</I>, last summer's hot
weather focused attention on local air pollution from road traffic and there are
several projects to improve the city's rail services.  A new bridge is being
built to transfer passengers between the Gare d'Austerlitz on the left bank of
the Seine and the Gare de Lyon on the right bank.  From 1997 a new RER metro
line, M&eacute;t&eacute;or, will carry 170m passengers each year between
south-east Paris and the Gare Saint- Lazare, stopping at three stations in the
business quarter near Op&eacute;ra.  In <I>Milano</I>, the Passante
Ferroviario, an 18 km railway line between north-west and south-west Milano, of
which more than half runs underground, is expected to come into operation in
January 1997. It will bring the local railway to the north of the city and the
national rail network together in a single system, and a large increase in
travel by train is expected to reduce urban traffic congestion.  In <I>London</I>
the major improvements in the near future are the &#163;300m rail link from
Paddington to Heathrow, due to open in 1997, and the &#163;2bn Jubilee Line
Underground extension eastwards through Docklands is due to open in March 1998.</P>
<P>London's international transport links will eventually be improved by the
high-speed rail link to the Channel Tunnel.  Other cities with developing
high-speed rail links (generally with earlier completion dates) include <I>K&ouml;ln</I>
(services to London, Paris and Amsterdam to begin in 1998), <I>Lyon</I>
(developing the TGV station at Satolas and pressing for a Lyon-Torino link under
the Alps) and <I>Amsterdam</I> (links from Schiphol to the French TGV and
German ICE networks to be completed by 2000).  In the longer term, <I>Barcelona</I>
stands to benefit from the agreement signed by Felipe Gonz&aacute;lez and
Jacques Chirac in 1995 to extend the TGV beyond Montpellier to Barcelona by
2004.</P>
<P>Among the Scandinavian cities, <I>Helsinki</I> is seeing a number of
international infrastructure improvements that could reinforce its gateway
status.  The coastal E18 road (Turku-Helsinki- Kotka-St Petersburg) is to be
upgraded to a motorway.  The rail link to St Petersburg will be improved and
served by a rapid Pendolino-train with travel time reduced to three hours. Other
improvements include the development of ferry connections from Helsinki to
Estonia and the upgrading of the main motorway from Tallinn to Poland (the
Baltlink project). However, probably the most important development in
Scandinavia is the construction of the &Oslash;resund fixed link (bridge and
tunnel) between <I>K&oslash;benhavn</I> and <I>Malm&ouml;</I> in southern
Sweden, due to be completed in 2000, which will cut travel time from an hour to
20 minutes.</P>
<H2>Strategic Planning Authorities</H2>
<P>Because the functional urban area of a city seldom coincides with its
administrative boundaries, in a number of cities the debate over what is the
appropriate area of competence for the city's local authority has continued. 
There are two examples of proposed changes that were rejected when put to the
electorate: the proposed union between the L&auml;nder of
<I>Berlin</I> and Brandenburg, and the proposal to create a new urban province
(stadsprovincie) of the Rijnmond around <I>Rotterdam</I>.  <I>Stuttgart</I>
has adopted an unusual arrangement to try to address the problem, by giving
responsibility for coordination of planning by the city and its surrounding
municipalities to the regional parliament.  <I>London</I> has lacked a
strategic authority since the Greater London Council was abolished in the early
1980s and its responsibilities were devolved to smaller authorities, but this
may change if a Labour government is elected.</P>
<H2>Medium-Term Growth Forecasts</H2>
<H3>Europe's Regions</H3>
<P>Although the level of per capita incomes is still uneven, the rate of growth
over the past decade or so has not followed any simple explanation in terms of
core/periphery or convergence/divergence.  The forecast for per capita value
added (GVA) growth over 1994- 2000, summarised in Figure 1, also reflects this
more complex picture.  In some cases peripheral regions continue to lag behind
and the gap in per capita GVA grows (eg Greece, southern Italy, southern
Austria, northern Sweden and Finland).  In other cases, a considerable degree of
catch-up is expected (Ireland, Portugal, east Germany).  There is some tendency
for existing divides to be strengthened within Spain (where the north-east and
Madrid have the faster growth rates) and France (where Ile de France,
Rhone-Alpes and Alsace continue to do well), and to some extent in west Germany
(where Hessen and Bayern are strong performers).  A somewhat more balanced
picture emerges for the UK, although this reflects a better performance of
northern regions in the earlier part of the period (that has largely already
occurred).</P>

<H3>Europe's Cities</H3>
<P>The long-term forecasts for economic growth in the cities are shown in Table
1.  The fast growth forecast for most of the cities in the Cohesion Fund
countries and east Germany mainly reflects the macroeconomic outlook for their
national/regional economies.  Similarly, growth in most of the French and west
German cities is depressed by the modest macroeconomic growth prospects
associated with the strong deutschemark, whereas growth in the UK and northern
Italian cities is somewhat faster.</P>

<P>Because it produces the most cyclically-sensitive products (notably
investment goods), manufacturing industry across Europe suffered the most during
the recession of the early 1990s and saw the strongest recovery in the past two
years.  This has tended to favour regions other than the major city regions
because the latter are generally specialised in consumer, business and
non-market services.  <I>Roma</I>, for example, was sheltered from the
recession but saw only a weak recovery as manufacturing plays a relatively small
part in its economy, and its manufacturing firms are not oriented towards export
markets.  However, those cities that are more specialised in manufacturing than
is typical, and those which serve a surrounding region that is specialised in
manufacturing, have generally benefited from the recovery.  Examples include
<I>Torino</I> and <I>Birmingham</I>.  Export-oriented regions in Italy have
received a further stimulus from the weak lira, favouring SMEs in <I>Bologna</I>
for example. Cities depending on port activity also benefited, notably <I>Rotterdam</I>.
 As one of Europe's most manufacturing-oriented major cities, <I>Stuttgart</I>
has been subject to the same trends and in 1994-95 saw some relief afforded by
exports of motor vehicles and plant and machinery. However, the cyclical
improvement has been overshadowed by the longer-term restructuring prompted by
the strength of the deutschemark.  A cyclical recovery has also been evident in
the service sectors of some cities where these services have the nature of an
investment (eg advertising, management consultancy, property), notably in <I>London</I>.</P>
<P>The present slowdown in growth in the major European economies is reversing
some of these gains, particularly as it has come earlier than had been expected.
 The recovery of port activity in <I>Rotterdam</I> tailed off in 1995. 
Manufacturers in <I>Hamburg</I> report high stocks and low order books. 
However, pressure to reduce budget deficits and public debt ratios to meet the
Maastricht criteria for EMU is also depressing growth among cities dependent on
non- market services.  <I>Bruxelles</I> faces this problem at the national and
regional levels, the latter because of the erosion of the region's tax base
caused by population decline.  Job losses in public services are expected in
<I>Stockholm</I> in response to strains in municipal budgets. Public
administration services in <I>Wien</I> are under similar pressure from measures
to control the federal budget, and the city's economy is also vulnerable to the
indirect effects of tight fiscal policy on consumer spending, since it is
oriented towards the domestic market.</P>
