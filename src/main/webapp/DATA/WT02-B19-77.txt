<i><u>Professor A. Mandelis</u></i><p>
      Research in in-situ, non-contact, non-destructive evaluation of industrial electronic materials,
especially GaAs and Si substrates and device-level chips, involves the development of novel
laser-based techniques to probe deep impurity levels and electronic lifetimes either dynamically
by pulsed laser excitation, or statically in a scanning imaging mode.  A recent technique
developed in our laboratory and called Infrared Radiometric Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy
is capable of detecting remotely semiconductor wafer dopants e.g. in semiconductor laser
materials.  It is aimed to generate a characterization method for industrial optimization of wafer
fabrication and manufacture.<p>

<i><u>Professor D. McCammond</u></i><p>
     Investigation of damage growth rates in Carbon and Kevlar composites under fatigue and
fretting fatigue loading.  This includes the use of NDT techniques to monitor the extent of
damage in individual plies and an analysis using anisotropic finite element techniques. <p>
     Measurement and analysis of stiffness, strength, fatigue and fracture properties of highly-aligned
polyolifin thermoplastics.<p>
 Investigation of the fatigue behaviour of Ti alloys, in particular the effects of biaxiality
and combined high cycle, (HCF), and low cycle fatigue, (LCF), loadings.  The HCF/LCF
interaction is being examined at HCF frequencies up to 30 kHz. <p>
     The research programs are being carried out in the Structural Integrity Fracture and
Fatigue Research Laboratory (SIFFRL). <p>

<i><u>Professor S.A. Meguid</u></i><p>
    <b> The Mechanics of Microcrack Toughening: </b> The needs of modern technology, as well as
the scarcity of traditional raw materials, have stimulated a growing interest in using brittle
materials (ceramics) in critical load-bearing applications.  Such applications are distinguished
from conventional structural uses of brittle materials in that maximum advantage must be taken
of available tensile strength without sacrificing reliability.  The potential value of many brittle
materials is evident when their properties are compared with those required for advances in
several technological areas.  These requirements frequently include unusual combinations of
properties, such as high ratios of strength and stiffness to weight, high hardness, chemical
inertness and dimensional stability over a wide range of temperatures.  Many brittle materials
can satisfy these requirements admirably. <p>
     The objectives of these investigations are to employ micromechanics modelling techniques
to develop a general solution for main crack-microcrack interactions and evaluate the effect on
microcrack toughening in advanced ceramics and their composites. <p>
   <b> Analysis of Cracks Near Bi-material Interfaces: </b>  As the demands made upon the
strength and durability of today's engineering materials increase, the advantages of combining
the properties of two or more materials into a structural member are very appealing.  However,
this same combination of material properties can aid in the failure of these members particularly
at an interface.  Fracture mechanics provides a powerful tool of studying the interfacial crack
problem in bi-materials. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.B. Park</u></i><p>
   <b> Microcellular Plastics:  </b>  An emerging advanced material called microcellular plastics has been
developed during the last ten years.  These unique plastics are characterized by extremely small
bubble size in the polymer matrix which enhances physical properties. Microcellular plastics can
be made of nearly all polymers including amorphous, semicrystalline, elastomeric, thermosetting,
and liquid crystalline polymers. Current issues include processing-structure-property
relationships for microcellular foamed plastics, effects of crystalline structure on the foam
morphology, and the reduction of flexural creep in foamed thermoplastic products. <p>
<b> Plastic/Wood-Fiber Composites:  </b> Wood-fiber reinforced plastic composites have received a
great deal of attention because of their thermoformability and repeated recyclability.  New
compounding techniques and interfacial treatments make it feasible to disperse high volume
fractions of hydrophilic wood fibers in non-polar polyolefins such as polypropylene and
polyethylene.  These compounds can be continuously extruded, thermoformed, pressed, and
injection molded, and thus offer the potential to replace wood and glass fiber composites in
many applications.  Current issues include characterization of PVC/wood-fiber composites and
microcellular foaming of plastic/wood fiber composites. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.N. Sinclair</u></i><p>
     Research is being conducted in the area of nondestructive material characterization, by
means of ultrasound.  Effort is concentrated on digital signal processing of sonic waves in the
0.1-300 frequency band.  The potential for evaluating material strength, toughness,
microstructure, residual stress, and temperature distribution by high frequency waves has been
demonstrated, via analysis of wave attenuation, velocity, and phase as functions of frequency. 
Materials investigated include carbon steel, graphite composites, wood, and plastics.
     The development of new techniques in elastic plastic fracture mechanics is having a
strong impact on the design of pressure vessels and high pressure piping.  Investigations are
being made into new experimental techniques as well as the underlying foundation of concepts
such as the J-integral and crack tip opening displacement. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.K. Spelt </u></i><p>
     Structural adhesive bonding offers many advantages over welding or other forms of high
strength joining.  The study of adhesion is also fundamental to the development of composite
materials and laminated structures. Current research areas include: adhesive wetting and
adhesion mechanisms, degradation and nondestructive evaluation of adhesive joints and
laminates, engineering design of joints and laminates. <p>
     The study of adhesion is also being applied to biofouling or the growth of organisms
(such as zebra mussels) on solid surfaces (pipes, heat exchangers). <p>
