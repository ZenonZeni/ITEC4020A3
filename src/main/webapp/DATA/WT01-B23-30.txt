DOJ Report</a> - Feb, 1994 </p>

<p>This Department of Justice report was a search and summary of
all of the existing evidence on the relationship between drugs
and violence. The report found that alcohol was the only drug
which had any real connection to drug-induced violence. Nearly
all of the violence associated with illegal drugs was a result of
the fact that the drugs are illegal, not as a result of
pharmacological effects. </p>

evaluate the effectiveness of the DARE drug-education program in
the schools. The basic conclusion was that DARE was highly
popular with both police and the school officials, but had no
real effect on long-term drug use. </p>

</p>

<p><a href="../ACTIVIST/how2men.htm">How to Hold Your Own In A
Drug Legalization Debate</a>, by the DEA, November, 1994 </p>

<p>This booklet was the result of the DEA's emergency conference
in August, 1994, in which they tried desperately to find some way
to keep from getting their butts kicked when they engaged in
public debates on drug policy. It is a direct response to the <a
href="../ACTIVIST/strats.htm">Persuasive Strategies, </a>and
borrows from the Persuasive Strategies on several occasions. </p>

<p><a href="../ACTIVIST/how2men.htm">Reply to the DEA's book </a>&quot;How
To Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization Debate&quot; </p>

<p>In this section, I go through the arguments the DEA has raised
in their book and examine them in detail against the Federal
Government's own evidence on the subject. In addition to missing
the point, the DEA is not telling the truth. </p>

<h3>National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Information </h3>

<p><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22"><a
href="http://www.health.org/">NCADI Home Page</a> </p>

<p>Contains information such as the Drug Abuse Warning Network
(DAWN) Reports, the Household Survey on Drug Abuse, and other
information. While the information contained in these surveys is
significant, it needs to be viewed carefully in light of the
problems which are encountered with any attempt to collect
information on illegal activities. In addition, when such
information is reported to the media, the government officials
releasing the information will tend to make up press reports
which are misleading, to say the least, when compared with the
full text of the reports. Readers of these reports should read
them carefully to determine the difference between the press
release and the details of the report, and they should also refer
to the problems in collecting accurate data, discussed in the GAO
report, Drug Use Measurement. </p>

published in the July '94 issue of FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin </p>

<p>This is another one of those hare-brained plans to stamp out
drugs in the community. Among other things, the police get
together with the neighborhood residents and get them to sign a
contract vowing to be drug-free. Oh well, it made them feel
productive for a while. </p>

<p>These are the hearings on legalization held by Congressman
Charles Rangel in 1989. It is a good example of the thinking and
arguments being used at that time. Most notable is the fact that
no real research was done, just some collecting of opinions, and
many of the members of the committee said their mind was made up
before they heard the evidence. </p>

<p><a href="anahord.htm">A Proposed Anaheim Ordinance </a></p>

<p>This is a proposed ordinance for the city of Anaheim,
California which would have barred people from city parks if they
had ever been convicted of a drug offense. Just another dumb idea
from our politicians. This one later fell to a combined lawsuit
by the ACLU and NORML. Contributed by Jim Rosenfield. </p>
