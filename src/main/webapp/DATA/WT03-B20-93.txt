<h1>Energy Awareness Month--Speech</h1>

<h2>Energy Awareness--Why Should We Care?</h2>




<ul>
 <li>For the fifteenth year in a row, the Department of Energy (DOE) has 
declared
that October is Energy Awareness Month.  Some people may ask why?  Prices 
are
reasonable.  There are no gas lines or fuel shortages.  Why should you 
care?

<ul>
<li>The reason is our children, their children, and the generations that 
follow.
The United States and other nations are making decisions today that will 
affect
the global economy and environment for centuries to come.
</ul>
 <li>In 1860, when Abe Lincoln was running for President, the United 
States was
using the equivalent of 111 million barrels of oil annually.  Today, we 
use
that much oil in less than a week.
<ul>

<li>Energy--where we get it, how we use it affects virtually every aspect 
of our
lives--our health, our budgets, our national economy, our national 
security, our
lifestyles.

<li>We think it's worthwhile once a year to stop and think about this 
pervasive
influence on our lives.
</ul>
 <li>To understand the role of energy today, and properly plan for its 
future, it
is important to understand its past.

<ul>
<li>Since the first Native Americans, we have constantly sought new 
sources of
energy.  We first used our own physical energy, then harnessed the 
strength of
animals.

<li>We tapped the power of streams and rivers to operate machines, caught 
the
wind to pump water and to sail our ships.

<li>We found ways to use fossil fuels for energy, and today they account 
for 85%
of the energy used in the United States.

<li>We learned to harness the energy from nuclear power, which provides 
20% of
our electricity.  

<li>We also are learning ways to more efficiently use renewable energy: 
solar,
hydro, wind, and thermal.  Renewables today account for 8% of our 
nation's
energy.

</ul>
 <li>Energy surrounds us, yet it is seldom noticed.  It is hidden behind 
walls and
underground, or is designed to prevent us from having to think about 
energy
within our cars.  Our homes, cars and consumer products often are 
designed to
prevent us from having to think about energy.

<ul>
<li>For example, we all know that automobiles use a lot of energy, but do 
you know
how much of the energy contained in your car's gasoline actually turns 
the
wheels?  The answer is only 13%. The rest of the energy is wasted.

<li>Another example:  the United States has 5% of the world's population.  
Do you
know what percent of the world's energy we use?  The answer: 25%.

<li>One more quiz question:  we know that motor vehicles cause air 
pollution. Do
you know how much we spend for health care related to air pollution? The
answer:  $50 billion each year.  By one estimate, that pollution is 
responsible
for 120,000 premature deaths each year in the United States. 
</ul>
 <li>Though we may take it for granted, energy costs amount to a 
significant
portion of the dollars we spend.  We don't realize the cost, because the 
energy
costs of our products are imbedded in them--we don't see the energy costs 
for
manufacturing, transporting, or marketing. 

<ul>
<li>Last year, we spent $51 billion on imported oil.  By the end of this 
decade,
the amount of U.S. dollars leaking away to oil-producing nations overseas 
is
expected to grow to $94 billion. 

<li>Today, we spend almost $500 billion annually in the U.S. to light and 
heat
our homes and offices, run our transportation systems, and operate our 
farms
and factories.

<li>Even modest energy savings can produce new tax-free disposable income 
for our
families, new capital for our businesses, and lower overhead to make our
industries more competitive. 

</ul>
 <li>But money is not the only reason we should be aware of energy.  The
production and consumption of energy causes more environmental damage 
than any
other single human activity.

<ul>
<li>To give just one example:  the energy that runs our appliances, 
furnaces,
water heaters, air conditioners, and lighting produces two tons of carbon

dioxide each year for every man, woman, and child in the United States. 
</ul>

 <li>This October, the world stands at a crossroads in regard to energy 
use and,
by extension, the quality of our natural environment and our lives.

<ul>
<li>During this decade, the United States is expected to spend as much as 
$200
billion on new electric generating capacity.  

<li>Worldwide, nations will spend an estimated $1 trillion in the next 
few years
to bring electric power to the billions of people who don't have it. 

<li>The choices we make about where that energy comes from and how it is 
produced
and consumed will affect the world environment for a long, long time to 
come.
</ul>

 <li>That's why DOE established this year's Energy Awareness Month theme 
as
"Energy--Our Future Is Today."

<ul>
<li>The goal of Energy Awareness Month this year is not only to promote a 
greater
public understanding and awareness of energy sources, but to encourage 
all of
us to take the long view--to consider the kind of future we want to 
create for
our children, and the children being born in other nations around the 
world.
</ul>

 <li>Today, policy makers in Washington and in the international 
community often
refer to this long-range view as "sustainable development."

<ul>
<li>The goal of sustainable development is to meet the needs of today's
generation without impairing the ability of tomorrow's generations to 
meet
<u>their</u> needs.

<li>In sustainable development, we engage in economic development in ways 
that do
not harm the environment.  In other words, we find ways to achieve both
economic development and environmental health.

<li>Our future depends on our ability to make peace between economic 
development
and the environment.  And how we produce and consume energy will be the 
key to
our success or failure.
</ul>

 <li>To understand the need for sustainable development, let's take just 
a moment
to look at this global view--at the big picture. 

<ul>
<li>25% of the population lives in developed countries like the United 
States.
They consume 75% of the energy worldwide.  

<li>Today, an estimated two billion people around the world do not have
electricity.  In the years ahead, there will be a major push among 
nations to
meet their energy needs.

<li>China and India--the world's two most populous nations--are among the 
many
underdeveloped countries undertaking aggressive economic development 
programs
and planning major investments in energy systems. 

<li>The world investment in energy, with its attendant impact on 
environment,
will keep growing. The world's population is expected to shoot from 5.6 
billion
to 8 billion in the next quarter-century. Driven by this continuing 
population
growth and by economic development, global energy consumption is expected 
to
increase as much as 50% by the year 2010.
</ul>

 <li>The United States must lead the world in developing and using energy

efficiently, and in making the transition to clean, renewable resources 
like
solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal energy.<p>

 <li>One thing is for certain:  we can use the energy sources we have 
more
efficiently and get more power for our money.  We can and are finding new

sources of energy, and we can reduce the impact of energy on the 
environment. <p>

 <li>As Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary puts it: "There has never been a 
greater
opportunity for the United States and other nations around the world to
harmonize the needs of people with the protection of the environment.  If 
we
don't produce and use energy correctly today, we risk damage to our 
environment
tomorrow...The discovery and use of sustainable energy resources advance
economic growth, energy security and environmental health at the same 
time." <p>

 <li>As we celebrate Energy Awareness Month, we all can renew our 
commitment to
using energy resources wisely for the generations that will follow.
