<h1><center> Cephalon hits ALS endpoint</h1> </center> <p>

Cephalon Inc. this morning reported positive results on the most widely anticipated trial of 1995, its Phase II/III study of Myotrophin IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) in 266 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<P>
Patients on the high dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day of drug experienced less disease severity, slower progression of disease and better functional ability than patients on placebo. The benefits, which were dose-related, were evident as early as the first few months of therapy, the West Chester, Penn., company said. <P>
Data were presented on Saturday at the World Federation of Neurology Committee on Motor Neuron Diseases in Talloires, France. A neurologist who attended the presentation said the physicians reacted positively to data that "looks very promising. But no neurologist will make a decision until it's peer reviewed and examined in detail." The company didn't discuss survival data at the meeting. <P>
The announcement was made prior to the open of the market. <P>
CEPH's three-arm study enrolled 266 patients with active disease (Appel ALS rating score of 40-80) in the U.S. and Canada. Patients were evaluated for three months and then treated for nine months with 0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg/day of drug or placebo. Patients then were rolled over into an open-label study. <P>
The primary end point was change on the Appel scale. The trial was powered to detect a 12-15 point difference between drug and placebo. After nine months of therapy, patients receiving the 0.1 mg dose showed 25 percent less deterioration than patients on placebo in analyses of both rate of change and functional severity of disease (p less than or equal to 0.01 on both measures). <P>
<B><CENTER>Other endpoints</B></CENTER><P>
Patients also experienced a slower decline in lifestyle, as measured by 20-point changes on the Appel scale (logrank analysis p=0.002; Wilcoxon analysis p=0.001). The slower decline in lifestyle was confirmed by another secondary end point, an independent assessment of sickness and disability (p=0.01). <P>
The 0.05 dose showed positive effects that didn't reach statistical significance on both the primary and lifestyle end points. <P>
The Appel scale includes assessment of swallowing, speech and respiratory function, as well as muscle strength of upper and lower extremities, and function of upper and lower extremities. An Appel score of 30 is normal for a healthy individual. On average, the group receiving placebo experienced a 20-point deterioration by the sixth month of treatment, while the 0.1 mg group never reached that threshold. <P>
Myotrophin was well-tolerated. Side effects included mild injection site inflammation, changes in hair growth or texture, sweating and mild knee pain. <P>
Secondary end points were clinical global impression of change, in which physicians evaluated change in patients' condition month to month; clinical global impression of therapy, in which physicians evaluated patients month to month against baseline; and sickness impact profile, the patient's subjective evaluation of condition month to month as described to independent reviewers. <P>
A European study in 183 patients will be completed in July. The two-arm study is comparing Myotrophin at 0.1 mg/kg with placebo. IGF-1 is a protein found in muscle and other tissue that mediates regeneration of the peripheral nervous system. <P>
CEPH did two Phase I trials to establish a safe dose: a 48-patient study in healthy volunteers, and a study in 17 ALS patients. <P>
"We didn't think you could do a small study of short duration and demonstrate anything meaingful," said spokesperson Jason Rubin. "So we designed a study in a large enough patient population that it might be a pivotal finding." <P>
The company is collaborating with Chiron Corp. to develop Myotrophin under a 1994 agreement to develop therapeutics for neurological diseases.</A>. <P>
The other drug for ALS, which recently reported positive data, is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's Rilutek (riluzole). RPR announced in April that the glutamate antagonist showed a statistically significant survival benefit in a preliminary analysis of a Phase III trial in 959 patients. <P>
As presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in May, the drug led to a 17.4 percent increase in 12-month survival. The company's analysis so far hasn't shown a significant change in the rate of deterioration of muscle function.<P>
