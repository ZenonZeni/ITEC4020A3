The purpose of this conference is to explore the evidence to support

or disprove the hypothesis that:

<P>

&quot;The United States risks re-creating rural poverty through

immigration. This rural poverty may be even more difficult to

extirpate; since it requires overcoming language and education

barriers in an economy that penalizes with low earnings workers

without education and skills.&quot;<BR>


<P>

This is a working conference; we expect the 40 to 45 participants

to participate actively with researchers and local government

officials to discuss immigration and integration developments

in rural communities. A conference to discuss the policy implications

of the community studies is planned for 1997 in Washington DC.

<BR>


<P>

The presentations will each be about 20 minutes long, permitting

time for discussion. Please note that not all of the speakers

have been confirmed.

<P>

The &igrave;face&icirc; of rural America is changing, in part

because of immigration from Latin America and Asia. In many small

cities and towns in middle America, refugees arrived in the late

1970s and 1980s, and immigrants from Mexico and Central America

began arriving in ever-larger numbers in late 1980s and 1990s.

<BR>


<P>

We have held several changing face conferences in California to

<FONT COLOR=#000000>assess the prospects for integrating the immigrants

who have arrived since 1980 to fill agricultural and farm-related

jobs. Agriculture is a traditional port of entry for Mexican immigrants,

but economic and social mobility for immigrant farm workers has

in the past usually required geographic mobility--to get ahead,

many rural residents moved to cities. <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

This was the first seminar outside California. One way to highlight

the midwestern experience is to emphasize the similarities and

differences between &quot;Latinization&quot; in CA and the &igrave;browning&icirc;

of the midwest. There are three major points of contrast:<BR>


<P>

1. A major magnet attracting immigrants to rural Iowa is food

processing including meatpacking, which offers year-round jobs

that pay at least $6 to $7 per hour, or $12,000 to $18,000 per

year, enough to support a family in the US. In many cases, the

immigrants moving to fill jobs in midwestern meatpacking are not

settled out migrant farm workers.<BR>


<P>

This means that there are fewer solo males, and more families,

in meatpacking towns than in the farm worker towns that surround

fields and orchards elsewhere in the US. Seasonal farm workers

earn only half as much as meat packing workers--$5000 to $7000

per year. <BR>


<P>

The presence of families raises a number of issues --housing,

schooling, health care. Unlike California, where settled Hispanic

migrants often provide many services to newcomers, and where immigrants

are often segregated in particular towns or parts of cities, immigrant

meat packing workers in the midwest often obtain public and private

services from non-Hispanic providers, making them more &quot;visible&quot;

in the communities in which they live and work.<BR>


<P>

This visibility can lead to problems, as when law enforcement

officials harass Hispanics, or lead to extra services, as when

banks and newspapers add Spanish-speaking personnel to serve new

customers. In Marshalltown, Iowa, for example, immigrant meat

packing workers can and are buying homes for $30,000 to $50,000

with the help of bank loans; few seasonal farm workers can get

loans to buy houses.<BR>


<P>

2. The Hispanics and Asians in midwestern meatpacking are not

always immigrants, and they often work alongside US-born White

and Black workers in meatpacking plants. In many workplaces, Latino

immigrants are only 20 to 50 percent of the labor force, but everyone

agrees that their presence has increased sharply over the past

10 years, and is likely to continue to increase in the 1990s.

<BR>


<P>

The fact that some of the Latino workers are US-born, and that

they often work alongside US-born White and Black workers in plants

that have unions, means that work and family integration may evolve

differently in the midwest. In California, immigrants typically

had to move to cities to enjoy upward mobility, and they were

slow to develop home-grown institutions such as the United Farm

Workers union to help them to improve wages and working conditions

in the fields. In the rural midwest, by contrast, there are non-immigrant

workers who also have a keen interest in higher meatpacking wages

and fringe benefits, making it more likely that existing unions

etc will accommodate newcomers so that they do not have to form

their own organizations.<BR>


<P>

3. Neither the industries that have and are attracting immigrants

to the rural midwest, nor the communities that often provided

subsidies to attract plants, planned for the immigration and integration

of the minority and immigrant workers that they in some cases

recruited to fill jobs. Indeed, some argue that programs that

give employers wage subsidies for some workers during their first

six months of employment, plus the meatpacking industry&iacute;s

policy of not offering fringe benefits to workers for the first

six months, encourages worker turnover in a manner that minimizes

labor costs and maximizes migration in a labor-intensive industry.

<BR>


<P>

Meatpacking may turn out to be a mobile industry that moves into

rural areas, changes the size and composition of the population

in 25 to 50 midwestern towns, and then, in some cases, moves on,

with perhaps pork moving to North Carolina, and beef to Mexico.

In some cases, the plants were attracted to the rural midwest

with the help of subsidies, rather than paying the impact fees

that might be expected to be imposed on industries that generate

such externalities.<BR>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587761"><FONT SIZE=4>Immigration Patterns

and Integration Policies</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4> </FONT></H1>


<P>

The number of newly--arrived immigrants who have low levels of

education, little or no English, and low US earnings is increasing,

while federal support for poor people, and especially poor immigrants,

is decreasing. This disjuncture between immigration flows and

what is often termed &igrave;immigrant policy,&icirc; in light

of pending proposals to further reduce the access of immigrants

to federal means-tested programs, raises questions about how well

immigrants and perhaps their children will be integrated throughout

the US.<BR>


<P>

Immigrants in the US are concentrated--over half live in particular

sections or neighborhoods of six cities in six states. This concentration

magnifies the effects of immigration. About eight percent of the

US population is foreign-born, but 95 percent of all US residents

live in places that have less than eight percent foreign-born

residents.<BR>


<P>

Until the 1980s, immigrants roughly replicated the US-born population

in the single-best predictor of earnings--years of education.

Immigrants arriving since the 1980s, however, have a different

distribution of years of schooling. When arrayed by years of education,

immigrants are concentrated at the extremes of the distribution.

In this way, immigration joins globalization and technological

change as a factor that is adding people to the top and bottom

of the income distribution, not the middle class. <BR>


<P>

The ten midwestern states had about 2.1 million foreign-born residents

in the 1990 Census, including about 800,000 in the Chicago metro

area. About three-fourths of the 156,000 Mexican immigrants who

arrived in the midwestern US in the 1980s moved to Chicago. Chicago

is to the midwest in immigration matters what Los Angeles is to

CA--the home of most of the midwest&iacute;s Hispanics and immigrants.

Minnesota had 113,000 foreign-born residents in 1990, Kansas 63,000,

Iowa 43,000, and Nebraska 28,000.<BR>


<P>

As in the rest of the US, most immigrants to the midwest go to

cities--about 93 percent of the foreign-born residents in the

US, but only 76 percent of all US residents, live in urban areas.

Welfare rates are low in the rural midwestern states, and foreign-born

residents are not disproportionate users of welfare.<BR>


<P>

There were are about 2 million Hispanics in the ten midwestern

states, but many are US citizens who are moving to Iowa and Nebraska

from border states such as Texas and California. Not all of these

internal US migrants speak English, so there is a tendency to

assume that all Hispanics are immigrants, and thus exaggerate

the number of immigrants in some towns. <BR>


<P>

Illinois has about half of the Hispanics in the midwest, and most

live in the Chicago area. Kansas had the most Hispanic residents

of the meat packing states in 1992--about 100,000, followed by

Minnesota with 62,000, Nebraska 42,000, and Iowa 37,000<BR>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587762"><FONT SIZE=4>Meatpacking</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

The US meatpacking industry has experienced four major changes

since World War II. First, there has been a change in dietary

habits--the average per capita consumption of chicken increased

to 70 pounds per person per year in 1995, while that of beef and

pork fell to 67 and 52 pounds per person. <BR>


<P>

Second, there have been technological changes that permitted meat

packing to move from urban consumers of meat toward farmer producers

of cattle and hogs. Boxed beef, vacuum packing, and lower wages

in rural areas were among the reasons why it became preferable

to prepare retail packages of meat close to where animals are

slaughtered. <BR>


<P>

Third, there were important changes in the labor force, especially

after 1980, that led to more unskilled workers, women, and immigrants

in the plants--women traditionally have played a more important

role in poultry processing than meatpacking. Meatpacking has always

been an industry in the US that offered relatively high wages

to unskilled and non-English speaking workers, but employers in

the past may have had more incentives to develop and retain a

skilled meatpacking work force that lived in the town where the

plant was located. <BR>


<P>

Unions represented most meatpacking workers, and they had a master

agreement between 1950 and 1979 that &quot;took wages out of competition&quot;

by requiring relatively uniform wages and benefits throughout

the industry. The real hourly earnings of meatpacking workers

peaked in 1979, when meatpacking workers earned almost $15 per

hour in 1992 dollars, and almost 20 percent more than the average

manufacturing worker; in 1994, by contrast, real earnings were

less than $10 per hour.<BR>


<P>

Meatpacking earnings fell as unions and master agreements faded,

and as skill levels fell due to more automation and technological

changes. These changes may have made worker turnover less costly

to employers, and turnover may also have been encouraged by two-tier

wage systems that developed in the early 1980s and offered lower

wages and fewer fringe benefits to newly-hired workers.<BR>


<P>

Fourth, both the raising and slaughter of animals became concentrated

in fewer and larger operations. In some cases, meatpacking plants

were located next to huge feedlots that were owned by the major

packers. The cost of the animal remains the largest single part

of the cost of meatpacking--cows cost slaugherhouses $0.60 to

$0.70 per pound, and hogs $0.40 to $0.50 per pound, and &quot;disassembling&quot;

these animals into meat products costs $0.05 to $0.10 per pound

for beef, and $0.20 to $0.25 per pound for pork.<BR>


<P>

In 1990, Iowa had a labor force of 1.3 million, including 12,200

Hispanics and 10,100 Asians. Most Hispanics and Asians in Iowa

were <B>not </B>employed in meatpacking--there were about 41,000

persons employed in food manufacturing in Iowa in 1990, including

2000 Hispanics and 1000 Asians. About 25,000 Iowa workers were

employed in meat and poultry processing.<BR>


<P>

The 11 pork processing plants in Iowa--IBP operates 5 of them--

in 1996 paid $6 to $7 per hour to entry-level workers. Most pork

processors restrict benefits such as health insurance to workers

employed for at least six months. Most plants are hiring workers

constantly to fill job vacancies --it is not unusual to issue

200 W-2 statements at the end of the year to keep 100 jobs filled.

<BR>


<P>

In plants visited by seminar participants, five month old hogs

weighing 250 pounds each were &igrave;disassembled&icirc; at the

rate of about 1200 per hour, or 16,000 to 18,000 per day on two

eight hour shifts. The hogs are stunned, hung by one leg, stuck

with a knife, and then carried through washing and singing machines

to remove hair. Carcasses are then split, internal organs removed,

and then various cuts of meat are removed as the carcass travels

past workers armed with knives. <BR>


<P>

Meat is packed in vacuum bags, large paperboard bins, or other

means for transit, and then chilled before being sent in refrigerated

trucks to retail outlets--vacuum packing meat increases its shelf

life from 3 days to 3 weeks. Some meat processors specialize in

curing hams and preparing sausages.<BR>


<P>

Within the industry, meatpacking is sometimes known as a &igrave;kill

and chill&icirc; industry.<BR>


<P>

About one production worker is required for each 10 hogs slaughtered

on a daily basis, so a plant that slaughters 16,000 to 18,000

hogs daily has 1600 to 1800 production workers. Most of them wield

one of a variety of knives, and most workers have jobs that require

them to make a particular cut as a carcass moves by at the rate

of about one every three seconds.<BR>


<P>

The job hierarchy in most plants is relatively flat, meaning that

there are relatively few production jobs that pay twice the entry-level

wage. This is one reason why especially young men may be prone

to quit one plant for another in order to have an extended vacation,

to get away from a particular supervisor, or to find better housing,

thus contributing to high worker turnover.<BR>


<P>

Most rural areas in the midwest have unemployment rates under

four percent, so meatpacking plants advertise in local media,

some offer bounties of e.g., $200 for each new worker referred,

and some have recruiters who recruit locally, and persons who

travel to e.g., TX or CA, to seek workers. In many cases, the

workers who arrive to go to work are &quot;vulnerable workers&quot;

in midwestern towns.<BR>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587763"><FONT SIZE=4>Community Impacts</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

Iowa&iacute;s manufacturing sector was restructured in the 1970s

and 1980s. Many old-line companies that offered &igrave;blue collar

elite&icirc; jobs were sold or restructured, and local mainstays

of the community were often replaced on the shop floor by &igrave;vulnerable&icirc;

workers paid lower wages and sometimes recruited from outside

the community. As one result, the &igrave;local&icirc; factory

became something more alien or foreign in many communities--no

longer a place where son followed father through the plant gates.

<BR>


<P>

The Iowa state government and local communities have struggled

with economic restructuring and the changing work force since

the 1980s. On the one hand, many companies were persuaded to stay

in or move to Iowa with tax breaks and other subsidies. However,

when it became clear that many of the workers brought to Iowa

to staff the plants were non-English speaking immigrants, Iowa

sought to prevent at least the worst abuses associated with the

recruitment of non-English speaking out-of-state workers by requiring

employers to pay their return transportation if they quit soon

after arrival under some circumstances.<BR>


<P>

In many Iowa communities, the arrival of immigrants and US-born

Hispanics beginning the 1970s followed a three-step process that

limited the ability of state and local governments to regulate

newly-restructured industries such as meatpacking. First came

solo men, including those who were recruited by employers in border

regions or in Mexico. Then came families, either Asian refugee

families who had settled in the midwest, or the families of the

solo male Hispanics who learned that they could afford to bring

their families to rural Iowa because wages were relatively high,

and housing and other living costs were relatively low.<BR>


<P>

The third step was unauthorized immigrants, including friends

and relatives of earlier settlers, who used social networks to

get jobs with employers willing to hire immigrants with no English

and little education. However, the arrival of more Hispanics,

and more unauthorized immigrants, made many local residents wrongly

believe that most Hispanic residents were recently-arrived illegal

workers. In some cases, local law enforcement officers acted on

this belief, and perhaps unlawfully detained or harassed Hispanics.

<BR>


<P>

From the point of view of CA researchers familiar with seasonal

farm workers, the striking difference between meatpacking and

CA agriculture is that meatpacking offers year-round jobs and

annual earnings that are high enough to support a family, so that

the issues associated with the arrival of families--such as housing,

schooling, health care-- become important community issues early

in the migration process. In most cases, meatpackers, like farm

employers in CA, are interested more in getting workers on the

line than they are in ensuring that there is housing in the area

for new arrivals, schools for their children, or bilingual police

and other service personnel to deal with the newcomers.<BR>


<P>

A few profiles illustrated these differences. Storm Lake is a

city of 8800 in 1990, and is home to two meat-processing plants

that employ almost 2000 workers.<BR>


<P>

Storm Lake had three major waves of immigrants over the past 15

years to the IBP plant there--two types of Lao immigrants, Mexican

Mennonites, and other Mexican immigrants. The Lao immigrants were

recruited via private networks, and the Mexican Mennonites and

the other Mexican immigrants were recruited with the active support

of IBP.<BR>


<P>

The local community is divided over the influx of immigrants.

About 24 percent of the children in K-12 classes are minorities,

and the school system says that it must spend money on English

as a Second Language and bilingual teachers, perhaps reducing

services to local children. Pork processor IBP counters that it

has a $36 million annual payroll in the area, and that schools

might close if the plant closed.

<P>

Garden City, Kansas underwent similar demographic changes that

were traced to meatpacking operations. The opening of one of the

world's largest meat packing operations was associated first with

the secondary migration of Southeast Asians into the area, and

later Mexican immigrants. Some of the meat packing workers lived

in mobile home parks that were expanded to accommodate them.

<P>

Utah provides some of the most striking examples of demographic

and economic change. On the one hand, Utah has relatively rapid

population growth, and the Mormon church is expanding fastest

in Latin America, so that there may be more receptivity to hard

working Mexican immigrants in Utah than in many other states.

However, even in Utah, there are questions raised by the arrival

of Limited English Proficient children in schools etc.

<P>

The operation/expansion of meatpacking in rural communities seem

to generate externalities that were not planned for, and are now

the subject of contention. Among the options that might be considered

are local impact fees, such as those that CA developers must pay

on new housing developments.<BR>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc362587764"><FONT SIZE=4>Next Steps</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

The &quot;Changing Face&quot; title of this project is meant to

suggest that the demographics of rural America are changing rapidly,

as Mexican, Central American, and Asian immigrants take jobs in

agriculture and agriculture-related industries. The federal government

spends over $600 million annually on farm worker services, and

additional funds on rural development, but many of these programs

remain rooted in the 1960s philosophy that the best solution for

rural poverty is rural-urban migration.<BR>


<P>

This project will be extended in two directions. First, we will

examine the policy recommendations outlined above in more depth

with federal and state policy makers, with planned conferences

in the Spring of 1997 in Sacramento, and in the Spring of 1998

in Washington DC. These conferences will address issues such as:

How much awareness is there of the speed with which the demographics

of rural America are changing? To what extent have policymakers

thought about the need to revamp programs begun in the 1960s to

help persons trapped in agriculture to deal with the integration

of immigrants in the US?<BR>


<P>

Second, we plan to hold conferences in other areas of the US in

which it appears that the composition of the farm and &quot;near

farm&quot; labor forces began to change very rapidly in the 1980s.

We plan to hold a conference/field trip in North Carolina in the

Fall of 1997 that focuses especially on Black-Hispanic interactions

in the labor force.<BR>

<BR>


<P>

<CENTER><B>Conference Questions and Guidelines<BR>

</B></CENTER>

<P>

This is a working conference; we expect the 45 participants to

participate actively with researchers and local government officials

to discuss developments in these communities and what might be

done. A conference to discuss the policy implications of the rural

community studies presented at this conference is planned for

1997 in Washington DC.<BR>


<P>

<B>Community Studies Discussion Questions</B>

<P>

1. What are the major issues--pluses and minuses--associated with

high rates of immigration--adding one percent or more to the population

every year via immigration, or doubling the population of the

community when seasonal workers arrive? How would these issues

be affected if the inflow of new immigrants were stopped or significantly

reduced into your community, the aim of current border control

efforts and immigration reform legislation?<BR>


<P>

2. There is no generally accepted definition of immigrant integration.

However, when two or more distinct groups share a geographic area,

two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration

or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,

encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism

or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging

the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming

ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting

pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.

<BR>


<P>

Which type of integration is occurring in your community/region?

Why? What are the major factors affecting integration in this

community/region, e.g., jobs, housing, schooling, governance?

What public policies are most important in regulating the speed

and extent of integration in your community/region, e.g., housing

for families, jobs for adults, or education for children?<BR>


<P>

3. Many newly-arrived immigrants find jobs with the help of ethnic

networks. Do immigrant networks in rural communities confine immigrants

to low-wage jobs, or give them a hand up the job ladder? Some

have speculated that rural communities are distinguished from

immigrant cities such as Los Angeles--where immigrants are concentrated

at the top and the bottom of the skill and earnings distribution--because,

in rural areas, the top or the role models are missing--there

is a pyramid-shaped distribution of skills and earnings, i.e.,

a wide base of low-skill people and jobs that tapers off abruptly.

Is this true in your community/region?<BR>


<P>

4. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization

and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing

local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would

decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the

eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect

immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>


<P>

<B>Policy Implications</B>

<P>

1. Are there any particular communities/regions or public or private

policies that stand out in promoting successful integration, or

in impeding immigrant integration? What are the communities that

currently have a majority of foreign-born residents, and continue

to grow by one to five percent per year via immigration, likely

to look like in 10 years if current trends continue, i.e., are

current immigration patterns sustainable?<BR>


<P>

2. What seems to be the most variable affecting the success of

integration--number of immigrants, characteristics of migrants,

situation and attitudes of the community in which they settle,

or some combination of these? What does this variable suggest

about prioritizing government efforts to accelerate integration

in immigrant communities in agricultural areas--should housing,

jobs, education, crime etc.-- be tackled first, and why? <BR>


<P>

3. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization

and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing

local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would

decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the

eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect

immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>
