<STRONG>You Can't Have One Without The Other</STRONG>
<P>




Risk - Just the thought of it can give investors sleepless nights. However, through 
careful planning for your financial future, you can help manage risk.<P>
Risk is something you encounter everyday. Even crossing a busy street involves some
risk.
With
investments, balancing risk and return can be a tricky operation. All investors
want to
maximize their
return, while minimizing risk. Let's face it, putting your hard earned dollars on
the line
can be downright
frightening.<P>
Some investments are certainly more "risky" than others, but no investment is risk
free.
Trying to avoid
risk by not investing at all can be the riskiest move of all. That would be like
standing at
the curb, never
setting foot into the street. You'll never be able to get to your destination if
you don't
accept some risk. In
investing, just like crossing that street, you carefully consider the situation,
accept a
comfortable level of
risk, and proceed to where you're going. Risk can never be eliminated, but it can
be managed.
Let's
take a look at the different types of risk, how different asset categories perform,
and the
ways and
means to help manage risk.
<P>
<STRONG>Types of Risk</STRONG><BR>
When most people think of "risk" they translate it as loss of principal. However,
there are
many kinds of
risk. Let's take a look at some of them:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Capital Risk</STRONG> - Losing your invested monies.
<LI><STRONG>Inflationary Risk</STRONG> - Investment's rate of return doesn't keep
pace with
inflation rate.
<LI><STRONG>Interest Rate Risk</STRONG> - A drop in an investment's interest rate. 
<LI><STRONG>Market Risk</STRONG> - Selling an investment at an unfavorable price.
<LI><STRONG>Liquidity Risk </STRONG>- Limitations on the availability of funds for
a specific
period
of 	time.
<LI><STRONG>Legislative Risk</STRONG> - Changes in tax laws may make certain
investments less 
advantageous.
<LI><STRONG>Default Risk </STRONG>- The failure of the institution where an
investment is
made.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>How Do Different Assets Perform?</STRONG><BR>
It may seem that there are countless types of investment products to choose from
but,
basically, there
are three types of core investments: cash (or cash equivalents), bonds, and stocks.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Cash</STRONG> - Investments such as bank savings and checking accounts,
Certificates
of Deposit (CDs), and
Treasury Bills. The prices generally don't fluctuate very much. To investors
concerned with
loss of
capital risk, cash would appear to be the most secure choice, as principal is
guaranteed
and/or
insured. Savings and checking accounts are highly liquid, as they can be readily
converted
into cash.
With CDs, you may face liquidity risk, as they must be held for a predetermined
period of
time or may be
subject to penalties for premature withdrawal. Although risk to principal may be
minimal,
loss of
purchasing power, or inflationary risk, must be taken into consideration. When
inflation and
taxation are
taken into account, returns can be considerably lower. Hypothetically, let's say in
1981 you
earned 14%
in an investment. It sounds astronomical; however, the inflation rate at one point
that year
soared to
15%. That's a net loss of value of at least 1% - and that's before taxes take
another bite.

<FONT SIZE="-1">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures a representative sample of
goods and
services purchased
by American consumers. It is generally considered a primary measure of inflation.
T-Bills are
represented by the Salomon 1-3 year Treasury Index. It is an unmanaged index
generally
considered
representative of the U.S. short-term bond market. Bonds are represented by the
Salomon High
Grade
Long-Term Corporate Bond Index. It is a bond market indicator comprised of about
800 bonds
with
maturities of 12 years or more rated AA or AAA. Stocks are represented by S&amp;P 500
Stock
Index, a
registered trademark of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The Salomon and S&amp;P Indexes are
unmanaged and
do not include any charges or expenses that you may incur as a direct investor of
these
securities. Past
performance is no indication of future results.
</FONT><P>
<LI><STRONG>Bonds</STRONG> - Commonly called "fixed income investments," they are
basically loans
or "IOUs." Interest is
earned on the money you lend. The prices of bonds do move up and down, but normally
not as
much
as stocks. Many people think of bonds as conservative investments, but the returns
can have a
high
degree of volatility. The fluctuation of interest rates is called interest rate
risk, and a
downturn in the
bond prices could significantly decrease the overall return of any particular bond. 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Stocks</STRONG> - Represent equity in, or partial ownership of, a
company.
An easy
way
to remember the
difference between stocks and bonds is: "With stocks, you own. With bonds, you
loan." The
price of a
stock or share can move up or down, sometimes a lot. The returns of stocks from
year to year
can be
quite volatile, but, as the graph illustrates, the returns
from stocks
have
significantly outpaced inflation, and topped the returns from cash and bonds as
well, over
this twenty-year period.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Finding Your Comfort Zone</STRONG><BR>
It's possible to achieve higher returns through stocks rather than bonds, and
through bonds
rather than
through cash, but you can't expect to get higher returns without taking on some
degree of
unpredictability. If you seek higher returns, you have to be willing to live with
higher
risk. "How much risk
is right for me?" The answer will affect your investment decisions. Although past
performance
is not a
guarantee of what will happen in the future, historical results over a long period
of time
can help you
make your investment decisions.
<P>
<STRONG>The Ways to Manage Risk</STRONG><BR>
There are a number of strategies that can help limit risk while offering the
potential of
higher returns.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Diversification</STRONG> - Investing in a variety of investments, or
simply
following
the old
adage "Don't put all
your eggs in one basket." With a portfolio spread among several different
investments, you
benefit when
each type is doing well, and also limit exposure when one or more investment is
performing
poorly.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Asset Allocation</STRONG> - Building upon the diversification concept,
with
asset
allocation you create a
customized portfolio consisting of several asset categories (cash, stocks, bonds)
rather than
individual
securities. Changing economic conditions affect various types of assets
differently;
consequently, each
asset category's return may partially offset the others'.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging</STRONG> - Systematically investing a fixed
dollar
amount at
regular time intervals. When
this disciplined program is adhered to and market fluctuations are ignored, it
attempts to
"smooth out"
the ups and downs of the market over the long haul. Dollar cost averaging, however,
cannot
guarantee
a positive return in a declining market and you must consider your ability to
continue
investing on a
regular basis under all market conditions.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The Means to Manage Risk</STRONG><BR>
Most investors find it difficult to diversify effectively across the full spectrum
of cash
and individual stocks
and bonds. That is why so many investors have chosen variable products to apply the
strategies
previously mentioned. Mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal life
insurance
products  offer the potential for maximizing investment
performance,
investment flexibility, and convenience. They allow you to allocate investments
among s
