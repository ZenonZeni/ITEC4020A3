</font><font size=3><IMG SRC="lightblu.gif"><b> Preventive Enforcement: </b><P>

<UL><LI><B> Pre-license Checks  and Post-Shipment Verification:</B></font><font size=3> All export license applications are screened electronically by EE to ensure items are not illegally exported.  In addition EE reviews specific individual license applications to assess diversion risks, identify potential violations, and determine the reliability of those receiving controlled U.S.-origin commodities or technical data.  In some instances EE, or another Federal agency, requests that a pre-license check be conduced to determine the bona fides of the transaction and suitability of the end-user.  The result of this check is factored into the licensing recommendation EE makes to BXA's licensing offices.  In addition, EE carries out post-shipment verifications to ensure that a controlled U.S.-origin item has actually been delivered to the authorized ultimate consignee or end-user and that it is being used as claimed on the export license application.<p></font><font size=3>

<LI><B> Safeguards Verification Program:</B></font><font size=3>  Annually, EE conducts numerous on-site safeguard verification trips around the world.  During these trips, pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications are conducted on controlled U.S. goods, especially those of proliferation concern.   In cases where EE's Safeguards Verification Teams discover items are being used inappropriately or in a manner that is inconsistent with an export license they  work closely with host government officials to correct the situation.  The EE verification teams also assess the suitability of foreign firms to receive U.S.-origin goods and technologies that require U.S. validated licenses. <P></font><font size=3>

<img src="inspect1.gif" align=right width=100 height=200 border=2> <LI><B> SED Review Program:</B></font><font size=3>  EE conducts on-site reviews of selected Shipper's Export Declarations (SED) at U.S. ports before goods are exported and again after shipments are made.  These on-site reviews are conducted to uncover attempts to export items illegally which require a validated export license from the Department of Commerce.  Items for export to destinations of concern and exports of proliferation concern are targeted specifically.<P>

<IL>In addition to the preventive enforcement efforts under the SED Review Program, EE's Office of Enforcement Support identifies past shipments that may have violated the Export Administration Regulations and refers them to the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) for further investigation. Hundreds of investigations of suspected export control violations occur annually, based on the routine review of SEDs.<P></font><font size=3>


<LI><B> Visa Application Review Program:</B>  </font><font size=3>Initiated in 1990, the Visa Application Review Program attempts to prevent the unauthorized access to controlled U.S. technology or technical data by aliens visiting the United States. Under this program, information on visa applications is reviewed to detect and prevent possible violations of the Export Administration Regulations.  Each year this program results in a number of recommendations against issuing visas being forwarded to the U.S. Department of State.<P></UL></font><font size=3>

<img src="lightblu.gif"><A NAME="index3"></A> <B>Protecting the National Interest and Prosecuting Violators</B><P></font><font size=3>

<img src="inspect2.gif" align=left width=125 height=235 border=2>
Export Enforcement protects U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests by educating exporters, interdicting illegal exports, and prosecuting violators, all without impeding legitimate trade activities.  Export Enforcement special agents work with BXA's licensing officials and policy staff to deter the export of items which, in the hands of unreliable users, can prove damaging to U.S. interests.<P>

Export Enforcement personnel also work closely with BXA's Office of Chief Counsel and U.S. Attorneys offices in bringing enforcement actions against violators of the Export Administration Regulations.  Violators can face criminal penalties (fines and possible imprisonment), civil penalties and administrative sanctions, or both.  The  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.fedworld.gov/pub/bxa/1_denial.txt"><i><B>list of Denied Persons</b></i></A> contains information on the names and addresses of firms and individuals denied access to U.S. goods in addition to the reason(s) for the denial action.<br> <BR> <BR></font><font size=3>

<img src="lightblu.gif"> <B>Penalties for violations of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) can include:<P>

<UL><IL><img src="whitebal.gif"><B><I>Criminal:</I></B></font><font size=3><P>

<IL><B> "knowing violations:"</B> The penalties for each such violation can be a fine of  $50,000 or five times the value of the exports involved, whichever is greater, may be imposed in addition to imprisonment of up to five years. 

	<B>"willful violations:" </B> The penalties for each violation -- where the violator has knowledge that the items will be used for the benefit of, or that the destination or intended destination of the items, is any country to which exports are restricted for national security or foreign policy purposes -- for individuals is a fine of up to $250,000, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.  For firms the penalties for each violation can be $1 million or up to five times the value of the exports involved, whichever is greater. <P>

<img src="whitebal.gif"> </font><font size=4><IL><B><I>Administrative:</I></B>  </font><font size=3><p>
<IL>For each violation of the EAR any or all of the following may be imposed: <P>

<UL><LI> Revocation of validated export licenses;<BR>
<LI> The general denial of export privileges;<BR>
<LI> The exclusion from practice; and/or<BR>
<LI> 	The imposition of fines of up to $10,000 per violation, or for a violation of  national security export controls, $100,000.<P></UL>

<IL> The maximum civil penalty allowed by law during periods where the regulations are continued in effect by an Executive Order pursuant to the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) is $10,000 per violation. </UL><P>

<img src="lightblu.gif"></font><font size=3> <B>Temporary Denial Orders:  </B><P></font><font size=3>

Temporary Denial Orders are issued by the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, denying any or (typically) all of the export privileges of a company or individual to prevent an imminent export control violation.  These orders cut off not only the right to export firm the United States, but also the right to receive or participate in exports from the U.S.<P>

</font><font size=3><img src="lightblu.gif"> <B>Section 11(h) Denials:</B><P></font><font size=3>

Section 11(h) of the Export Administration Act provides that, at the descretion of the Secretary of Commerce, no person convicted of a violation of the EAA, IEEPA, or Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (or any regulation, license, or order issued under any of these laws) will be eligible to apply for or use any export license issued under the EAA for up to ten years from the date of the conviction. <A NAME="index4"></A> In addition, Section 11(h) provides that the Secretary of Commerce may revoke any export license in which the party had at the time of the conviction.<P>


</font><font size=3><img src="lightblu.gif"> <B>Public Cooperation:</B><P></font><font size=3>

In its efforts to inform and educate the public, EE's special agents participate in seminars and trade shows across the country.  These events provide the special agents the opportunity to meet with many exporters and freight forwarders directly,  provide them with guidance on export control and enforcement matters, and to hear private sector concerns.  <P>

 	Business Executives' Enforcement Team (BEET) Program: The BEET program is part of EE's effort to prevent possible violations by expanding its contacts with U.S. businesses.  The BEETs are a series of half-day meetings, held around the United States, that allow corporate officials to learn about their export control and enforcement responsibilities while offering them the opportunity to question export enforcement officials about U.S. export control issues. BEET participants explore ways for businesses and enforcement officers to work together to prevent violations and identify projects of concern for proliferation reasons. <A NAME="index5"></A> We expect to schedule BEET conferences in the near future.  When they are scheduled, they will be listed <A Href="____________________"><B><I>here</I></B></A>.<P>

</font><font size=3><img src="lightblu.gif"> <B>Enforcement of New Programs:</B><P>

<UL><IL><img src="whitebal.gif"> <B>Fastener Quality Act:</B></font><font size=3>  The Fastener Quality Act (FQA) prohibits anyone who represents their fasteners as meeting standards established by certain standards setting organizations or government agencies (i.e., manufacturers, importers, and private label distributors of fasteners) from selling fasteners that <U>do not</U> meet the standards appearing on their products.  It also requires the testing of fasteners by an "accredited" laboratory to ensure they meet the standard claimed and the retention of records relating to testing for five years.  Three organizations within the Commerce Department are responsible for implementing the FQA. <p>
 
<UL><LI>BXA's Export Enforcement is responsible for enforcing the FQA and conducting industry outreach programs to ensure compliance with the FQA.  In cases of alleged violations of the FQA, EE will conduct investigations and pursue criminal and administrative sanctions as appropriate.<p>

<LI><B>The National Institute for Standards and Technology <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov"><I>(NIST)</I></B></A>  determines the standards-setting organizations which set the FQA standards.  NIST is responsible for accrediting the laboratories that conduct tests under FQA; for recognizing private accrediting organizations; and for maintaining the list of accredited laboratories.  <p> 

<LI><B>The Patent and Trademark Office <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov"><I>(PTO)</I></B></A> maintains the Fastener Insignia Register to record insignias of fastener manufacturers and private label distributors to ensure traceability of fasteners.</UL><BR> <BR>
