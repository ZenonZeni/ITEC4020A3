<P>Cambridge Econometrics' industrial service is designed to meet the needs of
business and government for medium and long term structural forecasting and
analysis of the UK economy.  The service is organised around subscriber meetings
and two forecast reports a year, in January and June.  The forecasts take into
account the latest  available data from official statistics and government
policy statements.</P>
<H2>Subscriber Meetings</H2>
<P>A central feature of the service is the involvement of subscribers in
preparing the assumptions and in  discussing the results of the forecasts.  In
October, tables of assumptions together with supporting text are communicated to
subscribers giving them the opportunity to comment and state their views. These
are taken into account when assumptions are finalised. The service includes two
meetings a year, shortly after publication of the January and June forecasts to
present and discuss the analysis and outcomes.  Our forecast presentations in
January and June are accompanied by guest speakers addressing topical issues. 
Recent speakers have included Kate Barker (Chief Economic Adviser, CBI), John
Stewart (Managing Editor, Housing Market Report) and Mike Hollingsworth (Chief
Economist, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders) and Vicky Pryce (Partner
and Chief Economist, KPMG).</P>
<P>In addition the service includes an annual two-day residential conference to
explore in greater depth topics important to long-term economic development. 
The 1996 conference was <I>Beyond the Manifestoes,</I> and it was held at
Robinson College, Cambridge on 8-9 July 1996.  The speakers included MPs from
the three main political parties (Angela Knight, Conservative; Andrew Smith,
Labour; Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat), John Mitchell of the Royal Institute
of International Affairs, Prof Phil Goodwin of the University College London,
Prof Jim Taylor of the University of Lancaster and Andrew Britton of the
Churches Enquiry into Unemployment and the Future of Work.</P>
<H2>The Reports</H2>
<P>The structure of the reports, and the selection of tables and the economic
variables analysed, have evolved to match the requirements of subscribers.  Each
industrial report is divided into three parts.</P>
<UL>
<LI>the forecast overview with chapters on the world economy, UK economic
policy, the industrial forecast and the macroeconomic background</LI>
<LI>industry in detail, with text, charts and tables to analyse and interpret
in comprehensive detail the prospects for the 49 industries distinguished in the
report</LI>
<LI>the main tables giving the macroeconomic summary, coverage of prospects at
the detail published in the official Index of Production, with comparable detail
for the service industries, and finally levels and growth rates for a wide range
of economic variables.</LI></UL>
<P>The forecasts are available on diskettes for easy use by subscribers in
their own databases.</P>
<P>The reports also contain special features of topical interest.  In recent
issues, these have included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Effects of the EC's Carbon/Energy Tax on the UK Economy</LI>
<LI>Inward Investment</LI>
<LI>Prospects for the UK Housing Market</LI>
<LI>Disaggregated Analysis of UK Exports by Country and Sector</LI>
<LI>Changes and Pressures in the Service Sector</LI>
<LI>Property in a Low-Inflation Era</LI></UL>
<H2>The Model We Use</H2>
<P>The projections are based on MDM, a very large model with some 5,000
variables. It is distinguished from most other UK models by its degree of
`disaggregation'  - the extent to which it breaks the economy down into
different sectors - and by the fact that it is estimated on annual rather than
quarterly data.</P>
<P>Other models do incorporate some disaggregation (or are accompanied by an
industrial model as an add-on extra), perhaps as a matter of convenience in the
context of a basically aggregate or `macro' approach to model-building, and in
such models events at sectoral level cannot be taken formally into account.  In
MDM, on the other hand, the 49 industries are distinguished as integral parts of
a single large model.  The number of industries is chosen to give a good balance
across the economy, without encumbering the model and the forecast with
irrelevant and unnecessary detail.  Because the model solves `bottom-up' by
adding industry projections together, it does not suffer from the discrepancies
between industry totals and macro totals that appear in a two-model approach. 
It produces consistent macroeconomic, industrial and financial forecasts, which
are provided together, in one service.</P>
<P>As an annual model, estimated on time-series data going back to the early
1960s or earlier (1954 for some series), MDM is particularly well-suited for
medium and long-term forecasting.  The data are continually updated from
official sources using the 1990 price base and the 1992 SIC.</P>
<P>Our projections include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the familiar macroeconomic aggregates (such as gross domestic product)</LI>
<LI>demand for the products of each industry</LI>
<LI>factors influencing supply in each industry, such as costs, productivity,
employment, profits and investment.  Projections are provided for investment in
buildings and works, in plant and machinery, and in vehicles, by 38 sectors in
each case, and for consumers' expenditure by 68 categories.</LI></UL>
<P> The model has a long pedigree of combining input-output and time-series
econometric equations.  The most recent account of the properties and
specification is given in Barker and Peterson <I>The Cambridge Multisectoral
Dynamic Model of the British Economy</I>, published in 1988 and already into its
second printing.</P>
<P>MDM is a powerful forecasting model; at the same time, it undergoes
continuous improvement at Cambridge Econometrics to take account of advances in
economic theory and econometric techniques.</P>
<P>Comment on the Barker and Peterson book:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Taken as a whole this is a valuable book which, by describing and justifying
the features of a large econometric model, sets a standard for other modelling
groups to meet.  It will be interesting to see if they rise to the challenge.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Economic Journal</I>, December 1988</P>
<H2>Forecasting Structural Change</H2>
<P>MDM is essentially a model of economic <I>structure</I>, which is important
for an economy undergoing long-term structural change due to such factors as 
the rise and decline of North Sea oil, rapid technological development, and
major changes in economic policy. Conventional aggregate macroeconomic models
rely on economic relationships remaining stable through time, but these are more
likely to break down when the composition of the economy is changing.</P>
<H2>Applications</H2>
<P>The detail incorporated in MDM means that it can be used to examine the
prospects for particular industries and their interactions with the rest of the
economy in a way that more aggregate econometric models cannot.</P>
<P>This applicability of MDM means that our reports can be tailored to the
requirements of individual clients, and that the aspects most relevant to their
needs can be selected.  Work of this kind is carried out on a consultancy basis
and falls into the following categories:</P>
<H4>Complete Forecasts</H4>
<P>Preparation of a complete forecast based on assumptions specified by a
client.  In this working relationship, we use the client's own corporate view of
government policy and the world economy to obtain projections using MDM.</P>
<H4>Scenarios</H4>
<P>It may be valuable to consider a range of alternative assumptions concerning
an indicator, for example a variety of exchange rates around a central
projection.  To meet this kind of need, simulations are carried out, varying
particular assumptions and examining the resulting differences from the central
projection.  The critical assumptions to be varied are first agreed with the
client.</P>
<H4>New Models</H4>
<P>We can create new econometric models for specific needs.  Work of this sort
has included in the past the preparation of sub-regional models for local
authorities and models linking a company's sales to MDM indicators.</P>
<H4>Market Prospects</H4>
<P>Provision of forecasts and assessments for a particular sector or
sub-region.  Such reports provide data and predictions at a very detailed level.</P>
<H4>Briefings and Seminars</H4>
<P>Held either in Cambridge or on clients' own premises, to present and discuss
the reports and services provided.</P>
