<h3 align=center>LEGAL ISSUES</h3>

<p>Children with ADHD may be eligible for services under special education
(IDEA) if they meet the eligibility criteria for one of the handicapping
conditions covered in this act, or they may be eligible for services under
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation act of 1973, if they fall within the
definition of &quot;handicapped person&quot; described in this legislation.
It is critical that regular education and special education cooperate to
ensure that the needs of these students are met and that a system be in
place that allows for a systematic identification of these students and
other students eligible for services under these mandates. </p>

<h4>IDEA</h4>

<ul>
<li>Students are eligible for free and appropriate education and related
services as other health impaired if the ADHD results in a &quot;chronic
or acute health problem that results in limited alertness, which adversely
effects academic performance.&quot; 
<br></li>

<li>They may also be eligible as emotionally disturbed or as learning disabled,
if they meet the eligibility criteria for these two handicapping conditions.

<br></li>

<li>Requires free and appropriate education and an IEP that is reasonably
designed to benefit the student. 
<br></li>

<li>Decisions are made by a committee made up of representatives from administration,
instruction, and special education, as well as the parent. If new assessment
is being discussed an assessment person must be present. 
<br></li>

<li>Placement in the least restrictive environment. 
<br></li>

<li>Consent is required before initial evaluation. Areas to be assessed
are specifically prescribed for each handicapping condition. Timelines
are provided and re-evaluations are required every three years. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Section 504</h4>

<ul>
<li>Students may be eligible for services under Section 504 if their ADHD
results in &quot;a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits
a major life activity.&quot; 
<br></li>

<li>Requires free appropriate education that is individually designed to
ensure that the eligible student has a program comparable to other nonhandicapped
students. Results in an Accommodations Plan. 
<br></li>

<li>Decisions are made by a group of knowledgeable persons, including someone
who knows the child, someone who can interpret the assessment data, and
someone who knows the district's resources. 
<br></li>

<li>Placement in the least restrictive environment. 
<br></li>

<li>Only notice is required before evaluation. No specific guidelines are
provided regarding evaluation except the assessment must use multiple sources
of information and must be conducted by someone who is trained in the use
of the measures used. No time lines are provided but periodic reevaluations
are required. Reevaluations are also required prior to any change of placement.

<br></li>

<li>The Department of Civil Rights monitors the compliance of Section 504.
</li>
</ul>
