&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will Steger, a native Minnesotan and second of nine children, began very young to dream about exploration.  When 12 years old he participated in the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year project by volunteering to help chart the northern lights.  At 15, he and a brother built a small boat and traveled together down the Mississippi River.  He completed an expedition by kayak from southern Alberta to northern Alaska - a trip of 3,000 miles - at the age of 20.  As a young adult, he continued to seek <IMG SRC="steger.gif" ALT="steger.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=381 BORDER=2>adventure and challenge himself personally through exploration - making three first ascents of peaks higher than 18,900 feet in the Peruvian Andes, and kayaking 4,000 miles on the Mackenzie, Peace and Yukon Rivers.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a bachelors degree in geology and a masters in education, Will taught junior high school science in St. Paul for three years.  However, he found the classroom confining, and searched for a way to combine his love of teaching with his passion for nature and the outdoors.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1970, Will bought the first pieces of land which would grow over the years into the "Homestead" - a 300 acre complex outside of Ely, northern Minnesota, in the midst of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.  He built himself a small cabin and began organizing outdoor winter camping skills trips for students, primarily juvenile delinquents from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.  This endeavor grew into the Lynx Track Winter School and gave Will the opportunity to teach science, as well as geology and conservation, in a classroom without four walls.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will also continued his own exploration of the Arctic by dog sled and cross country skis.  These "personal" expeditions - either solo or with one or two others - deepened not only his affinity for the Arctic, but also his appreciation of the importance of polar regions to the rest of the planet and the need to bring the world’s attention to this fact.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will’s first major, planned expedition was to the North Pole using dog sleds in the spring of 1986.  His goal was to successfully reach the Pole without any outside aid in either navigation or supplies, making his the first successful dogsled expedition without resupply since Robert E. Peary’s 1909 expedition.  En route to the Pole, on the 8th of April, the path of Steger’s expedition miraculously crossed that of Jean-Louis Étienne - a Frenchman attempting the first solo ski to 90° North.  Étienne and Steger sat together that evening in Steger’s tent, drinking tea and talking, and discovered that they shared the goal of crossing Antarctica by dogsled.  Phone numbers were exchanged, and the next day the two expeditions went their separate ways, both to successfully reach their goal of the North Pole (Étienne on the 11th of May, 10 days after Steger’s team).  However, soon after returning to their respective homes, Steger and Étienne began to coordinate the 1989/90 International Trans-Antarctica Expedition.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to the individual challenge of crossing Antarctica by dog sled along its longest axis - a distance of 3,741 miles - the International Trans-Antarctica Expedition meant to demonstrate the possibility of international cooperation in achieving a common goal.  The team was comprised of six men, from six different countries and very different backgrounds.  They started from Seal Nunataks at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, on July 27, 1989, reached the South Pole on December 11, and arrived at their final goal - the Mirnyy Base of the former Soviet Union on the far side of the continent - on March 3rd, 1990.  Returning from their adventure, all six team members traveled to each country represented on the expedition.  There, they met with political leaders and scientists to discuss the importance of international cooperation in protecting the Antarctic continent.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Steger’s third major expedition took place just over a year ago.  The 1995 International Arctic Project crossed the frozen ocean by dog sled from Severnaya Zemlya to the North Pole, then continued south to Ward Hunt, on the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, accomplishing the final leg of their route using specially-designed canoes with sled-like runners for portaging over the ice.  Once again the team of six - four men and two women - was international, and the focus was on the education of the public about the Arctic as well as on personal achievement.  On this expedition, however, Will focused his attention on the education of children - the leaders of tomorrow.  The International Arctic Project carried a laptop computer - complete with its own sleeping bag to keep it warm during the freezing nights - on the trek.  Team members transmitted daily reports directly to classrooms around the world via the internet.  Perhaps most importantly, they were also able to receive messages from the school children, who asked them about the everyday aspects of the expedition.  In this way, countless children participated in the adventure, learning about geography, geology, history, conservation and exploration in an exciting, hands-on manner.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the successful completion of the International Arctic Project, Will has declared that his days of planning major, international expeditions are over.<IMG SRC="chinstp2.gif" ALT="chinstp2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=149> As fulfilling as his three major expeditions have been, especially to his goal of focusing the world’s attention on the Arctic regions, Will is eager to return to the simpler explorations possible with only one or two people.  He plans on continuing his own exploration, and is working on a solo ski to the North Pole for the summer of 1997.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has not given up his efforts to focus global attention on the Arctic and Antarctica however, and is readying the Homestead for use as a conference center where educators, scientists and international leaders can meet to discuss and develop strategies for heightening global awareness of the importance of our polar regions.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In December of 1995, National Geographic Society presented Will with the John Oliver La Gorce Medal for accomplishment in geographic exploration, the sciences and for public service to advance international understanding.  Will is just the 19th recipient of this honor since the medal’s inception in 1909.  Other honorees to be so decorated are Robert E. Peary, Amelia Earhart and Jacques Cousteau.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The National Geographic Society has been a part of Will Steger’s life since he was a boy.  As a ten-year-old, he traded his hockey skates for a sledload of old National Geographic magazines!  Will credits the Society for fueling his interest in the polar regions - especially Antarctica - with their provocative photographs and articles of early polar explorers.  The National Geographic Society has been a contributor to each of Steger’s three major expeditions, and published his articles and photographs from his journeys.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all of the support he has received from the National Geographic Society over the years, Will is now giving his time in assisting National Geographic with their educational efforts in the polar regions.  He will be a part of Zegrahm’s expedition-leading team, and will host members of National Geographic’s Grosvenor Council, on our <B>Antarctica, South Georgia & Falkland Islands</B> voyage, departing 15 January 1997.
