<P>
The Australian Petroleum CRC was established in July 1991 and expanded two years later. The CRC carries out geoscience and engineering research for the Australian petroleum exploration and production industry. Its activities are primarily focused on Australia, but some research is carried out overseas in countries such as New Zealand, PNG and Indonesia.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre pursues seven research programs: petroleum exploration technologies, petroleum geophysics, basin analysis, reservoir characterisation, improved oil recovery, drilling and wellbore engineering, and reservoir testing and stimulation (including coal bed methane).
The CSIRO's Division of Petroleum Resources has a major geomechanics laboratory with triaxial compression test cells and a polyaxial load cell, an X-ray CT Scanner for core analysis as well as conventional core test facilities, a mini-hydraulic fracturing system for field tests, and a slim hole well test system.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Technological successes with major implications for the efficiency of Australia's petroleum industry include:
<UL>
<LI>novel analytical tests to help petroleum explorers identify the most prospective areas for exploration;
<LI>a potential solution to the problem of multiple attenuation which afflicts much of the seismic survey information collected on the North West Shelf;
<LI>a breakthrough in the quantitative description of the heterogeneity of reservoir properties measured by well logs;
<LI>demonstration of effective methods for the hydraulic fracturing of Australian coal seams to stimulate coal bed methane production;
<LI>development of effective tools for analysing and solving wellbore instability problems that present significant challenges to drilling;
<LI>development of new insights into the mechanics of three-phase displacement in porous media, which will allow better design of improved recovery projects;
<LI>development of a three-phase multicomponent reservoir simulation program (SIMED II) designed specifically for coal bed methane work, that is as good as or better than any in the world.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
All of the research programs have industry sponsorship to some degree. In almost all cases the end product is a service, but in rare cases the outcome is a product, such as the SIMED II program.
In this case the program has been leased to a customer as a precursor to a likely sale, and negotiations with likely overseas customers are in progress. Export earnings have already been generated from research contracts with overseas companies.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Historically, petroleum resources have been located on the eastern side of the continent and oil exploration companies have been headquartered in Melbourne.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
A high level of integration of postgraduate education and research activity has been achieved in the centre. All research thesis students work on projects that fit within one of the centre's programs. The postgraduate degree programs, available at universities in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide, are primarily based on a research thesis.
Training courses or workshops are organised by participants ranging from in-house courses presented to a single company to courses with a mixed attendance of industry personnel and post-graduate students. Courses are also conducted in South-East Asia.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Centre for Petroleum Engineering, University of NSW, Sydney
<LI>Curtin University's Petroleum Geophysics and Geochemistry groups, Perth
<LI>CSIRO Division of Petroleum Resources, Melbourne and Sydney
<LI>National Centre for Petroleum Geology and Geophysics, Adelaide
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
Oilfield service companies looking for new opportunities could be interested in commercialising the techniques and services developed by the CRC. Each program and project has major objectives tailored to specific industry needs.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Total CRC expenditure in 1994-95 approximated $16 million, of which about half was cash and the other half in-kind expenditure. Australian Government CRC funding is $2.7 million per year.
