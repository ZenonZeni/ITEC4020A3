<P>
This submission is made on behalf of  the National Association
of Community Legal Centres. We submit on the basis of our broad
ranging and hands-on experience with complaints mechanisms and
police issues in various State Jurisdictions.
<P>
 <B>Introduction:</B>
<P>
The experience of Community Legal Centres in dealing with complaints
against police has lead to a stongly held view that  all aspects
of those complaints must be dealt with independently of the Australian
Federal Police service including the Commissioner.   A separate
&quot;Commission&quot; or &quot;Complaints Authority&quot; with
far reaching powers of investigation should be established.  Such
an Authority must have powers to initiate investigations in a
pro-active manner with a view protecting the reputation of the
AFP and preventing the abuse of power.  It must have the resources
necessary to investigate complaints received and where ever possible
to engage in proactive steps to prevent the causes of complaints
arising.  Powers to make recommendations on systemic change must
compliment its investigative functions.
<P>
The proposed authority should be established as a model for all
states to emulate  and should adopt independent external investigation
and adjudication powers in relation to all complaints against
police as recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal
Deaths in Custody.  
<P>
Public confidence in the investigation of police complaints is,
in the experience of CLC's assisting members of the public with
complaints of police mistreatment and abuse of power, directly
related to the real and perceived independence of the complaints
authority. The view that &quot;Caesar should not judge Caesar&quot;
is in our experience a very strongly held view among Australians
when it comes to the issue of complaints against police.
<P>
The ever increasing powers being given to police, and the likelihood
that additional powers will be given to the AFP, requires that
public confidence in police complaints mechanisms be achieved.
 Nothing less than the independent authority referred to above
will satisfy the confidence of the Australian people.  
<P>
 It is vital whatever mechanism is adopted to deal with complaints
that the process be as open and transparent as possible. Furthermore,
public accountability by means of  &quot;comprehensive&quot; annual
reports is vital if the public are to have any faith in the complaints
process.
<P>
The appropriate level of accountability that  should be required
of  the AFP must be that designed to prevent the abuse of power.
 It must be external, independent and discourage systemic and
individual abuse.   This level of accountability must apply to
the powers granted by the community to our police to carry out
their vital role on our behalf, as well as to the process of 
investigating complaints about police.
<P>
Whilst the scope of the current  Senate Standing Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs Inquiry hearing is limited to
the  Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill 1994,
we must be ever mindful of ensuring that appropriate levels of
accountability are provided in legislation granting and regulating
AFP powers.  No matter how appropriate the mechanisms provided
for the investigations of complaints against  the AFP might be,
little satisfaction will be gained for complainants if the horse
has already bolted.  The best outcome for the AFP and the Australian
community is for the cause of complaints to be eliminated wherever
possible.  This is best assured by an independent and external
complaints authority complementing police powers granted in  a
manner designed to prevent abuse in the first instance.
<P>
The National Association of Community Legal Centers submits the
following views in relation to the proposed amendments :-
<P>
<I><B>Clause 1</B></I><B> :  Short Title</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Nil...
<P>
<I><B>Clause 2</B></I><B> :  Definitions<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
<B>i-ii. Coverage of AFP staff members by the Complaints Act.
 </B>
<P>
The National Association does not object to the extension of the
complaints regime to non-sworn staff members of the AFP. However
consideration should be given to the different responsibilities
entrusted to sworn and unsworn personnel.  
<P>
In disciplinary proceedings involving public servants generally,
the evidence required to make out the complaint is on &quot;the
balance of probabilities&quot;.  If  complaints against these
public servants are now to be assessed under the complaints mechanism
for sworn AFP members, it may be that the burden of proof now
required will be the criminal burden of  &quot;beyond reasonable
doubt&quot;.  If this is the case, then it will effectively represent
a decrease in  the level of accountability to the public of these
public servants.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 3</B></I><B> :  Conciliation<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
<B>i. Protection of evidence obtained in conciliation proceedings</B>
<P>
It is considered appropriate for matters raised in a conciliation
session to remain confidential as is the case in many other settings.
  It is generally accepted that  confidentiality is essential
if conciliation proceedings are to be effective.
<P>
<B>ii. Discretion not to use Senior Members as Conciliators</B>
<P>
While the second amendment to Section 6B is intended to reflect
changes in the AFP service structure (i.e., consolidation of the
AFP rank structure), a more fundamental issue relates to the appropriate
processes to be used in conciliation and the perceived independence
of conciliators (that is independent of  the AFP). 
<P>
It is fundamental that in any conciliation process there must
be no power imbalance between the parties. The independence of
the conciliator in this regard is essential. It is crucial that
 AFP personnel not  act as conciliators in relation to complaints
against (the proposed) AFP appointees and Federal Police officers,
as that would undermine public confidence in the conciliation
process.<BR>

<P>
It is appropriate to monitor the operation of the conciliation
process.  A &quot;monitoring and evaluation&quot; strategy should
be implemented to report on &quot;process and outcome&quot;. This
must entail assessing the views of complainants and AFP personnel.
The findings should be  assessed and made public by way of  an
annual report.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 4 </B></I><B> Action Consequential on Report</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
It is the view of the National Association that these decisions
ought not be made by the Commissioner.  If the Commissioner is
to continue in the role of determining whether charges should
or should not be laid, it is most appropriate for the Commissioner
not only to  &quot;consider&quot; but to incorporate the views
of the &quot;independent&quot; Ombudsman. 
<P>
Our preferred position would be for the Director of Public Prosecutions
to make the decision whether to lay criminal charges, upon referral
from the appropriate independent complaints authority.  Decisions
to proceed on disciplinary charges, or to offer a caution or admonition,
should be made by the independent complaints authority, in consultation
with the Commissioner if appropriate.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 5</B></I><B> :  Transfers to investigation Division</B>
<P>
<B>Section 16.</B>
<P>
This section relates to the transfer of &quot;Federal Police Officers&quot;
to the Internal Investigations Division. It also allows an officer
to perform duties that are not related to the Divisions functions
if the Commissioner so directs, and provided the performance of
those duties don't  unduly interfere with the performance of the
Division. <BR>

<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Internal Investigations Divisions which are solely or largely
comprised of police officers are often likened to &quot;Caesar
investigating Caesar&quot;. The active promotion of an &quot;Internal
Investigations Department&quot; which continues to be comprised
solely of police members will continue to come under public criticism.

<P>
The opportunity should be taken to restructure any AFP Complaints
Mechanism to  utilise the skills of civilian as well as police
investigators &quot;when required&quot;. The establishment of
an independent  Authority or  &quot;Commission&quot; if properly
established could provide a national model for the states.
<P>
The proposed and continued policy of police investigating police
is not considered to be a viable long term proposition if for
no other reason than the continuing criticism, lack of faith and
perceived lack of impartiality that such a system has attracted.
<P>
Research undertaken in Victoria indicates that the public are
most reticent  to report complaints against police to other police.
 (see attached)
<P>
Even with the Ombudsman having power to undertake his/her own
investigations the dual system still is not optimal as it still
has police involvement in police investigating police.
<P>
Practical experience of police Internal Investigation Departments
compels the National Association to support the position taken
by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody <I><B>Recommendation
226 </B></I>calling for a review of police complaints procedures
in all Australian Jurisdictions and the adoption of  &quot;independent
external investigation and adjudication of all complaints against
police&quot;, whether or not made by Aboriginals.
<P>
 The proposed amendment contained in the new subsection (3) is
likely to blur the boundaries between the Internal Investigations
Division and the AFP proper even further with a consequent decrease
in public confidence in the complaints process. 
<P>
The proposed new subsections (4) &amp; (5) whilst logical within
the context of internal investigations merely serve to highlight
the fundamental problem associated with those investigations.
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 6</B></I><B> :  False Complaints and Providing false
information in relation to Complaints</B>
<P>
<I><B>i.  Making false statements or giving false information
about action taken by an AFP appointee.<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
It is the view of the National Association that no evidence is
provided to support the assertion that there is significant, or
even slight,  abuse of the complaints procedures by complainants.
 The over riding experience of CLC's is that members of the public
are generally reluctant and frightened to lodge complaints against
police officers.  They correctly perceive that they are at a significant
disadvantage whilst the complaints mechanism is effectively controlled
by the organisation about whose member(s) they wish to complain.
<BR>

<P>
It is accepted among barristers and solicitors practicing in the
criminal law in Victoria to advise their clients not to raise
complaints about police misconduct prior to the completion of
any charges facing them.  This position has been informally adopted
by the profession in Victoria because too often clients have additional
charges laid after lodging complaints against police officers.
 It is all too common to observe internal investigations staff
providing information to the prosecution at court and in some
instances internal investigation staff have directed prosecutors
not to withdraw charges against clients.
<P>
This amendment is opposed on the basis that it increases the opportunity
for additional pressure to be applied by unscrupulous  AFP appointees
on persons wishing to register genuine complaints against an AFP
appointee.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>ii.  Whereby anyone who threatens or harms another person
because of that persons involvement or someone else's involvement
in an investigation under the Act can be prosecuted for victimization.
 <BR>
</B></I>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
This clause is strongly supported.  The CLC experience indicates
that complainants against police fear, and are actually subjected
to victimization, as a result of  taking action to pursue their
complaint.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 7</B></I><B> :  Investigation initiated by the Ombudsman
of there own motion.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
This amendment is strongly supported on the basis that from time
to time the Ombudsman will become aware of  matters which would
justify a complaint but which has not been the subject of one.
The Ombudsman currently has no power to initiate an investigation
unless a complaint has been made. The amendment thus allows own
motion investigations under the Complaints Act .
<P>
In addition the Ombudsman role should encompass a proactive public
interest type approach which is able to actively pursue matters
of community concern related to the function and role of the AFP.
Such a proactive approach should focus not only on specific issue
areas but also on broad systemic areas as well. Full reports of
such investigations should be publicly available and details should
also be specified in the Annual report.
<P>
Adequate funding and resourcing of the Ombudsman's Office must
be provided in order that it is able to properly carry out its
duties.  Accountability mechanisms for the exercise of highly
intrusive police powers, made ineffective by inadequate resources,
are viewed cynically by the Australian public.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 8</B></I><B> :  Duties of Ombudsman with respect
to Complaints</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Within the context of the proposed amendments this provision is
supported to avoid duplication of effort in relation to simultaneous
investigations.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 9 </B></I><B>: Ombudsman may determine that complaint
should not be investigated</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Although it would be generally supported that the Ombudsman should
have the discretion to determine that in certain circumstances
a complaint should not be investigated, or investigated further
because of frivolity, vexatiousness, bad faith and triviality
scope should nevertheless exist to draw conclusions from such
low level seemingly disparate and meaningless complaints. <BR>

<P>
Although rudeness, bad language, abruptness and the like may appear
trivial such matters could in fact raise issue about broader systemic
issues ranging from the adequacy of  training to the nature and
extent of supervision in the field. The nature and extent of these
seemingly frivolous matters should be adequately reported.   Discrimination
on the grounds of gender, race, ethnicity, culture, religion,
disability, sexual preference or age is often reflected in such
&quot;frivolous or trivial&quot; treatment.   The failure to identify
and act on such complaints will lead to the development of a police
culture which accepts these forms of discrimination. <BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 10</B></I><B> : Special or additional Investigations
conducted by Ombudsman under this part.  </B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
We reiterate the comments made above with respect to Clause 4
regarding the roles of the DPP, Ombudsman and the Commissioner.
<P>
Recommendations for broader action by the ombudsman to the Commissioner
and Minister are strongly supported.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 11</B></I><B>: Power to obtain information and documents</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
It is inappropriate that the Ombudsman as investigator of last
resort has been restricted in the admissibility of evidence obtained
in the course of their investigation. <BR>

<P>
The suggested amendment allowing the admissibility of evidence
is strongly supported.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 12</B></I><B>: Persons affected to be informed of
results of investigation by Ombudsman</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
The proposed amendment requiring the Ombudsman, on completion
of an investigation to furnish to the Commissioner and the complainant
particulars of the result of the investigation is supported with
the suggestion that consideration should also be given to the
use of regular progress reports. (see <I><B>Clause 14</B></I>
) <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 13</B></I><B>: Ombudsman to  inform complainant of
results of investigation </B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Agree that Ombudsman inform complainant of results of investigation
undertaken by the Investigations division.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 14:</B></I><B>  Progress reports about complaints</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
It  would be most appropriate that a progress report be provided
to complainants at regular intervals i.e., 3 monthly. This should
occur whether the investigation is being undertaken by the Ombudsman
or the Investigation Division. If an investigation extends beyond
six months additional resources should be allocated in order to
expedite the matter. 
<P>
Investigations which go for years are an affront not only to the
complainant and the accused but to the system of justice as well.
<P>
In addition, it is suggested that simple and comprehensible explanations
of the status of a person's complaint should be provided.
<P>
Furthermore, the opportunity should exist for the complainant
to make comment on their perception of their treatment by the
respective complaints system. (i.e., exit poll) Complainants views
regarding the process and outcome should be &quot;monitored and
evaluated&quot; in order to address any deficiencies in the Complaints
mechanisms.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 15: </B></I><B> Reports of Special Inquiries</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
The recommendations that reports from inquiry's and person's appointed
by the Minister should go to both the Minister and the Ombudsman
is strongly supported with the additional recommendation that
such reports should become publicly available in ordinary circumstances
and not remain secret. The only exception to the public availability
of such reports may occur when prosecution is recommended in which
case the report should be available after the prosecution.
<P>
<I><B>These final amendments focus on the procedure for hearing
of minor disciplinary charges to which the officer charged pleads
guilty.<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>Clause 16: </B></I><B> New Part VA - Undisputed Charges</B>
<P>
The proposed amendment allows for such cases to be dealt with
by the Commissioner, where the ombudsman agrees instead of the
tribunal.  <BR>

<P>
It is considered that this design will eliminate unnecessary delays
under the procedure of providing guarantees that the procedure
adopted does not improperly protect the police.  Furthermore the
matter can be referred to the tribunal for penalty by the Commissioner
if the ombudsman agrees.<BR>

<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
The participation of the Commissioner in the disciplinary process
is not supported particularly so as to remove any appearance of
bias.  
<P>
If this preferred position is not adopted then at least the types
of charges in which the Commissioner may lay disciplinary charges
should at least be limited. Certain determined charges could go
before the Commissioner and the rest whether the member is pleading
guilty or not go before the tribunal.<BR>

<P>
In any event the nature and extent of these types of matters should
be &quot;monitored and evaluated&quot; and detailed research findings
be made public. <BR>

<P>
<I><B>New Section 52A - Undisputed Charges in Respect of Breach
of Discipline<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Pursuant to the preceding Clause referring to Part VA - We are
of the view that it is inappropriate that the Commissioner decide
whether the public interest requires proceedings to be dealt with
by the Disciplinary tribunal. 
<P>
The Commissioner has a clear conflict of interest between public
confidence which requires retention of public confidence in the
AFP, and the public interest which requires breaches of discipline
to be dealt with appropriately.
<P>
The above places the Commissioner in a difficult quandary and
one in which the Commissioner should not be placed in. 
<P>
Decision making in this area would be better served if delegated
to the DPP or Ombudsman.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>New Section 52B - Commissioner may Impose Penalty</B></I>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
It is most important that the person being disciplined should
always be provided with the opportunity to provide some sort of
written submission in response to the penalty being applied.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>New section 52C - Ombudsman to be notified of penalty</B></I>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Agree<BR>

<P>
<I><B>New section 52D - Ombudsman may inform Attorney General
of penalty</B></I>
<P>
<B>and</B>
<P>
<I><B>New section 52E - Appeals</B></I>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
The intention of these amendments is allow an appeal against an
inadequate penalty imposed by a Commissioner. 
<P>
We note that an Ombudsman who considers a penalty to be inadequate
only has a discretion to report in writing with comments to the
Attorney General and the Attorney General only has a discretion
to decide to appeal against the Commissioner's decision. In view
of the that the Commissioner is a member of the AFP who is actually
imposing the penalty and that matters would have been largely
dealt with internally and not independently, the Ombudsman should
have a direct right of appeal rather than relying on the Attorney
General. Alternatively, this power could be delegated by the Ombudsman
to the DPP for appeal against the penalty.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 17: </B></I><B>Charges in respect of Breaches of
discipline</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
In keeping with the principal of external review it is considered
inappropriate that the complaints process should rely on advice
given by bodies or persons (i.e., Commissioner) which have an
interest in the procedural aspects as well as the outcome of the
investigation.<BR>

<P>
Furthermore the issue of how complaints are started or indeed
how they should be best allocated between the Ombudsman or the
Investigations Division is a vexed issue. 
<P>
Consideration should be given as to the point or indeed when is
it appropriate that complaints should be referred to each other.
How this should occur, and when, is an issue which requires further
clarification.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 18</B></I><B>: Powers of Tribunal</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
We agree that the Tribunal should have the power to have summoned
before it persons or evidence relevant to particular proceedings.
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 19 :</B></I><B>  Offense of Victimization</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
This amendment to the Act is considered to be of vital importance
as it is probably the single most important protection given to
people who make complaints against the police.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 20: </B></I><B> Transitional Provision</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Nil<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 21:</B></I><B> Other Amendments to extend application
of Complaints (Australian Federal Police)</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
Nil<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 22: </B></I><B> Other Amendments to introduce Gender-neutral
terminology in the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act
1981</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
<P>
General agreement with this clause<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Clause 23: </B></I><B> Other Amendments to penalties</B>
<P>
<B>RESPONSE:</B>
