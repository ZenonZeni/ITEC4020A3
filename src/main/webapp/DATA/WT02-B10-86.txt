AndCare is a diagnostic-device company based in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. The company focuses on the research, development, and commercialization of medical and environmental diagnostic devices.<P>

AndCare's core sensor technology includes a sensor containing immobilized enzymes, antibodies or other reagents on a disposable plastic strip and a portable electronic monitor, about the size of a paperback novel, to display the readout of the reaction signal.<P>

The company's sensor technology works as follows: a small sample is combined with a premeasured amount of chemical reagent. The disposable sensor is inserted into the portable monitor, and the sample is placed on the sensor. After electrochemical stripping analysis, the concentration of the substance being tested for is displayed on the monitor in minutes.<P>

AndCare's technology offers several advantages over other testing methods:<P>

<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>The sample is confined to the disposable sensor and never touches the monitor, increasing safety and decreasing the risk of sample contamination.
<LI>The system is cost-effective, with increased convenience and rapid test results.
<LI>The patented, easy-to-use sensor and monitor system requires minimal training for healthcare or environmental workers.

AndCare's patented sensor technology has been demonstrated in the company's LeadCareTM System, a point-of-care diagnostic device for measuring the level of lead in a patient's blood. LeadCare employs an electrochemical stripping sensor containing electrodes coated with colloidal-sized gold particles on a disposable plastic strip. The LeadCare System also includes a portable electronic monitor about the size of a paperback novel, to display the readout of the reaction signal and store data from testing for further analysis.<P>

With LeadCare, a small amount of whole blood or other sample from the patient is combined with a pre-measured amount of chemical reagent. The system's disposable sensor strip is inserted into the portable monitor and the treated sample is placed on the sensor. In less than five minutes, a measurement of the lead concentration in the sample is displayed on the monitor.<P>

"The use of colloidal gold in the sensor is one of the many unique features of the AndCare lead-testing technology recognized in this patent," said Robert Henkens, Ph.D., and AndCare's chairman and chief scientific officer. "AndCare's lead-detection system meets the analytical challenge of producing a practical device that can accurately and precisely screen young children for blood lead, a need recognized by the Centers for Disease Control."<P>

Lead, a toxic metal, is prevalent in today's industrialized society. Exposure to even minute amounts of lead, which was used until the late 1970's in residential paints and until the 1980's in gasoline, has been shown to cause several medical problems including developmental and learning disabilities in children.<P>

Clinical trials for the LeadCare System are currently underway at Boston Children's Hospital and elsewhere. Initial feedback has been very positive.<P>

The launch of the LeadCare System is currently scheduled for fourth quarter, 1996<P>
