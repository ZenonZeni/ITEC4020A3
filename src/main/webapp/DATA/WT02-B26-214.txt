<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland has been the nation's primary chemical weapons laboratory since the early 1900s.  Toxic wastes located in pits, trenches, and other disposal sites at Aberdeen are suspected sources of aquifer contamination beneath the facility.  However, because of local discontinuities in silt and clay deposition during the late Pleistocene and Holocene periods, the hydrogeologic framework cannot be imaged with confidence by using a single geophysical technique to define pathways of this contamination.  Multiple technologies are required to guide sampling and remediation programs.  
<P>

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
With support from the environmental program at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Argonne National Laboratory staff are using non-intrusive geophysical techniques to define aquifers and to guide drilling and sampling.  A pilot study was conducted in the southern Bush River Peninsula and adjacent waters to "see through" the Holocene-deposited silts and clays that effectively mask the underlying aquifers.   With the multiple technologies used by Argonne, identification of sediment type is possible at much lower costs than drilling.  Furthermore, data are acquired in a continuous profiling mode instead of discretely at specific testing stations.  Offshore and onshore data are well integrated.
<P> 
Aquifers beneath the Chesapeake estuary system are located in Cretaceous-age sediments of the Atlantic coastal plain and in paleochannels of Pleistocene age that were cut below sea level during low stands of the Pleistocene.  Subsequent rises in sea level during late Pleistocene and Holocene periods resulted in deposition of organic silts and clays that now blanket coastal plain sediments and effectively mask the underlying aquifers.
<P>
The Argonne approach to determining the hydrogeologic framework of these terranes was to use multiple geophysical data sets gathered both onshore and offshore.  From these data were inferred the geologic structure, distribution of silts and clays, existence of manmade artifacts, and porewater chemistry.
<P>	
Argonne utilized a variety of techniques to acquire the necessary data.  Side-scan sonar was used to image the details of water-bottom relief.  In shallow, high wave-energy areas near the shoreline, single-channel marine seismics provided high-resolution imaging.  Magnetometer profiling delineated the distribution of ferrous iron debris, as well as subtle trends in the magnetic properties of the bottom sediment.  Electrical conductivity mapping showed brackish water intrusion into shallow aquifers and differentiated coarse-grained materials associated with fluvial deposits from finer-grained silts and clays more commonly associated with quiet-water estuary environments.  Ground-penetrating radar imaging established the fine detail of water-bottom depths and the geologic framework to depths of 40 feet or more.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
A combination of techniques has been used successfully by Argonne staff in the Edgewood section of the Aberdeen Proving Ground to provide an excellent understanding of the underlying geologic framework.  Data acquisition was completed during the summer of 1994.  Data processing and interpretation were finalized during the spring of 1995.  Three reports are about to be published.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Technologies and procedures developed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground are constantly changing as they are modified and improved to explore the hydrogeologic framework at contaminated sites throughout the United States.
