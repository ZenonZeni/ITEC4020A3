<p><strong>Research Centers</strong>
<P>
Through insights in physics, chemistry, electronics, optics, materials science, and surface
science, national laboratory scientists have helped PV become a sophisticated technology. The
bulk of program research and development is currently conducted at the <a href="nrel.html">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a> and <a href="sandia.html">Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia)</a>.  In addition, <a href="http://sun20.ccd.bnl.gov/~pv">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> in Upton, New York, supports the
program in environmental, safety, and health research. 
<P>
Engineers and researchers help develop advanced devices and modules, new PV materials and
material combinations, more-efficient fabrication and manufacturing processes, better module
encapsulants, more sophisticated concentrators and sun-tracking equipment, and automated
manufacturing systems. They also help improve PV system designs and refine balance-of-system
components, including support structures, power-processing and control equipment, electronics,
monitoring equipment, and storage technologies. 
<P>
Specialists work with national and international organizations to establish uniform standards and
test methods. Rigorous testing ensures that the electrical, mechanical, and safety aspects of PV
systems are sound. Analytic studies&#151;including the results of environmental, resource, and
market assessments&#151;have an important impact on current and future R&D activities. 
<P>
But the laboratories also serve as incubators for new ideas. Because most companies cannot
afford large R&D laboratories, the national laboratories provide long-term, high-risk, high-payoff R&D, which is essential to investing in the nation's future&#151;toward clean, sustainable,
affordable electricity.
