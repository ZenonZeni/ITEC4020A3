DECEMBER 1995

'Bombing' is just one problem faced by electronic 
mail users

      The convenience and simplicity of electronic mail 
makes it an increasingly attractive communications 
medium for business, academic and personal 
correspondence, but it also has its inherent dangers.
     Unfortunately, E-mail is also easy to manipulate, 
and the same individuals and companies that are 
relying heavily on it to conduct business could be 
subject to a range of problems, including disruption 
of communications, violations of privacy or 
tampering with networks.
     A case in point occurred on a New Jersey campus 
last month.
     A Monmouth University junior faces federal 
charges after an "E-mail bomb" that crashed the 
school's message system was sent to the school's 
system on Nov. 20.
     The FBI has charged Dominick LaScala, 21, with 
flooding the accounts of two administrators with  
24,000 electronic messages and causing the uni-
versity's E-mail system to go down for about five 
hours, Grey Dimenna, university general counsel, 
confirmed. 
     "It basically overloaded our system," said 
Dimenna, adding that computer messages were only 
delayed, not lost.
      Investigators say the "bombing" may have been 
a simple act of retribution. Lascala's computer 
privileges were revoked by the two administrators on 
Nov. 17 after they received complaints that he was 
sending multiple commercial messages to 
inappropriate areas on the Internet, Dimenna said. He 
added that some of the messages sought investors in 
a restaurant, while others advertised a "900" pay-per-
call service.
     Joe LaGaipa, director of the university's computer 
services, who was one of the targeted administrators, 
said Monmouth computer specialists traced what 
they believe was an E-mail bomb revenge to a site in 
Atlanta and a remote site in Redbank, N.J., which is 
near the university. The computer account from 
which the random-text messages originated was a 
shared account with another student who was 
unaware of the bomb.
     "[The trace] was basically systems operators 
comparing systems and notes," LaGaipa told 
Telecom & Network Security Review.
     The FBI didn't actually take part in the initial 
investigation. Rather, Dimenna said, FBI officials 
became interested in the case after the trace when 
LaGaipa called the agency to ask if any crimes had 
been committed based on what had been discovered.
     An FBI official verified that LaScala did not enter 
a plea at his first court hearing and was released on 
$10,000 bail. 
     His charges include a felony for using a computer 
used in interstate commerce to send data that would 
deliberately crash a system, and a misdemeanor for 
using a computer with reckless disregard. If 
convicted, LaScala could be sent to prison for a 
maximum of six years and receive a maximum 
$350,000 fine.
     Dimenna said LaScala will also be disciplined 
under the school's conduct rules, which could result 
in suspension or dismissal. LaScala will first have 
the opportunity for a hearing at the university.
     LaGaipa said the university can't really protect 
itself from another E-mail bomb crashing its system, 
even with what it learned from the November attack.
     "There's no real protection ... it can happen again 
anywhere," he said. He added that the only protection 
is the knowledge by potential bombers that their E-
mail bombs usually leave plenty of footprints that 
can lead back to them.

**Ease of use means tough problems

     The New Jersey case may have turned out to be 
rather benign; no more than an inconvenience for 
users of the Monmouth University E-mail system. 
But this and other incidents should send up a 
warning flag to those who rely on E-mail for 
important and confidential communications.
     And there are a lot in that category. The Electronic 
Messaging Assn. estimates that there will be 70 
million corporate E-mail users in the United States. 
The same group estimates the electronic messaging 
business will grow from $3.5 billion in the United 
States in 1994 to $62 billion in 2000.
     E-mail is easy and inexpensive to use. And it can 
improve worker productivity by cutting down on the 
trips to a colleague's desk to conduct a brief exchange 
or eliminating the need to print out and photocopy 
multiple copies of memos. 
     But this medium creates new risks, too. Because 
information is so easily disseminated to a large 
audience, the risk of misdirecting confidential 
information is increased. And once you've sent an E-
mail message to the wrong party, there's no chance 
of retrieving it.
     This is exacerbated by the fact that people tend to 
assume files on a computer are private and are more 
likely to communicate a sensitive issue through E-
mail than they would be over the telephone or in a 
memo or letter. 
     It is also not possible to verify the source or 
recipient of an E-mail message -- unless of course it 
is encrypted or some other security feature is added 
to it. It is extremely easy for hackers to gain access to 
networks, or for colleagues to learn each other's 
passwords and send or receive information under 
different names, or alter messages sent by others. 

**E-mail lingers

     In addition, the law is unsettled concerning 
whether an employer can be held liable for illegal 
activities by an employee using a company-owned 
network. The major telecommunications bill that 
could be passed by Congress by the end of the year 
may resolve the issue. In some jurisdictions it is 
possible now that an employer would be held 
responsible if a worker downloaded pornography or 
other illegal material. Civil suits would be another 
possibility.
     On a related point, E-mail can be used as 
evidence in a court of law, just as other documents 
can. Many people don't realize that, but even of those 
who do, few recognize that even if a file is deleted 
from your E-mail, it is likely still lingering on a 
computer backup tape somewhere else. There is even 
a cottage industry of sorts popping up of specialists 
in locating electronic mail to be used as evidence. 
Two of them, both located in the Seattle, Wash., area 
are Computer Forensics Inc. and Electronic 
Evidence Discovery Inc.
     Another E-mail related issue that is generating a 
lot of attention is the expectation of privacy of the 
correspondents. According to Michael Corby of M 
Corby & Associates Inc., in most cases, "If the 
electronic mail ... system is used at a company, the 
employer owns it and is allowed to review its 
contents. Messages sent within the company as well 
as those that are sent from your terminal to another 
company or from another company to you can be 
subject to monitoring by your employer."
     The 1986 Electronics Communications Privacy 
Act protects the privacy of messages sent over public 
telephone lines and online systems such as 
CompuServe or American Online but does not cover 
private, employer-owned E-mail systems.
     But many people feel that absent a company 
statement to the contrary, the communications they 
make through their E-mail systems are private. And 
there are cases pending, particularly in California that 
could help clarify the law on this point.

**E-mail security checklist

     There are a number of key steps employers must 
take to secure electronic mail and protect the 
company or organization. These recommendations 
elaborate on information contained in "Manager's 
Guide to E-Mail Security," by San Francisco-based 
Computer Security Institute.
     * Write a strong, enforceable policy, like the 
proposed policy provided elsewhere in this issue. 
The policy should outline the appropriate uses of E-
mail, the penalties for misusing the system, the 
organization's intention to enforce the policy, 
procedures for purging E-mail files and the legal 
consequences of destroying E-mail evidence.
     * Reserve the right to monitor. Employers 
generally are protected against privacy lawsuits if 
employees are clearly informed that the information 
conveyed in company-owned E-mail systems is not 
private.
     * Implement security controls. Make sure audit 
trails, password controls and other security options 
in your E-mail software are activated.
     * Investigate using encryption. Pretty Good 
Privacy is one popular encryption method that was 
discussed in detail in the August 1995 issue of 
Telecom & Network Security Review.
     * Ensure the post office server is physically 
secure. The E-mail post office server should have the 
same level of security other network servers have. 
The servers should be kept where unauthorized 
personnel cannot get to them.
     * Promote security awareness by employees. 
This can be done through seminars or training 
courses, as well as through statements in the 
company employee manual.
     * Set up procedures for destruction and retention 
of archives. E-mail messages can be permanently 
destroyed, but generally are not. That's why every 
company should see that its policy for maintaining, 
storing and disposing of key documentation crosses 
over into the electronic mail arena.

**E-mail users fight police intrusion

     Privacy with regard to E-mail is unsettled law 
and, consequently, is the subject of litigation 
throughout the country. One related issue that is 
being fleshed out in the courts involves illegal or 
allegedly illegal material transmitted through E-mail 
and how law enforcement officials go about 
investigating such cases. 
     Last month Telecom & Network Security Review 
discussed the use of electronic mail, and in this case 
a bulletin board service, to set up a sting operation 
through which participants in an illegal cellular phone 
operation were arrested. Another pending case raises 
issues about privacy rights relating to investigations 
by police of electronic mail or bulletin boards.
     The case concerns a small computer bulletin 
board in Ohio. The Cincinnati Computer Connection 
has operated since 1982 and has several thousand 
subscribers, who pay a set fee for access to the 
board. Subscribers have the ability to send and 
receive E-mail, participate in on-line discussions, use 
and download software, play computer games and 
receive periodicals. Some subscribers -- about 3% of 
the users, say attorneys for the BBS owner -- also 
use adult-oriented information and "service options." 
     As part of an investigation to determine whether 
the adult-oriented material was pornographic, the 
Hamilton County (Ohio) Regional Computer Crimes 
Task Force obtained search warrants and seized 
computer equipment including computer hardware, 
video display units, printers, software, data drives 
and internal or external information storage units 
from the BBS operator, Bob Emerson.
     Now Emerson has filed a federal suit against the 
task force, and a separate federal suit has been filed 
by a group of the BBS users. The user group claims 
that only the 45 allegedly obscene images should 
have been seized. 
     The group's attorney, Peter Kennedy of Austin, 
Texas, said the police knew what they were looking 
for and should have seized only those files. The 
group wants the return of their electronic files and is 
alleging various monetary damage claims relating to 
loss of business or other correspondence because the 
files were confiscated. Kennedy successfully 
represented E-mail users in another case of seizure 
of communications for evidence purposes, but in that 
instance the defendant was the Secret Service (Steve 
Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret 
Service).
     Emerson, in his separate suit before the same 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, 
Western Div., is seeking damages of $250,000 for 
the loss of subscriber revenue and the loss of 
computer equipment confiscated in the search. He 
also says in the complaint that the law enforcement 
officials violated his 1st and 4th Amendment rights. 
     The complaint says the officials conducted an 
over-broad search "purposefully, in bad faith, in 
conscious and reckless disregard of [Emerson's] 
federal and constitutional rights to privacy, to free 
speech, and to be free from unreasonable searches 
and seizures, and with the intention to intimidate 
[Emerson] from his continued exercise of free 
expression and to impose prior restraint on the 
transmission of presumptively protected forms of 
expression ... by permanently removing from 
circulation non-obscene adult oriented and other 
forms of expression."
     Emerson's attorney, Laura Abrams, of the firm of 
Sirkin, Pinales, Mezibov & Schwartz, expects 
months of discovery before the case goes to trial. 
The user group and Emerson cases have been 
consolidated for purposes of discovery.

FCC confronts new ruse to get around pay-per-call 
rules

     Pay-per-call operations are using a new scam to 
play fast and loose with federal regulations 
governing audiotex services, but the Federal 
Communications Commission thinks the practice 
violates the letter and spirit of the law.
     Pay-per-call or audiotex operators have been 
moving overseas at an increasing rate, just as pay-
per-call traffic, usually of the X-rated variety, has 
been increasing. Favorable deals with less developed 
nations and evasion of U.S. pornography laws are 
the lures.
     Robert Spangler, deputy chief of the FCC's 
common carrier branch, said along with the 
movement overseas has been the frequent 
advertising of pay-per-call services using a dial-
around code (10XXX) of a long distance carrier. 
This suggests that the carriers are paying the 
information providers to advertise their dial-around 
numbers.
     More recently, foreign pay-per-call services are 
being routed through "500" follow-me numbers or 
"700" conference-calling numbers.
     Under the 1992 Telephone Disclosure and 
Dispute Resolution Act, all pay-per-call services 
must be provided on the "900" service access code. 
Any carrier involved in either transmitting or billing 
subscribers for pay-per-call services is subject to 
several statutory requirements meant to ensure that 
consumers can prevent access to or charges for 
unwanted information services. Specifically, the 
TDDRA:
     * Requires carriers to offer telephone subscribers 
the option of blocking access to pay-per-call services.
     * Prohibits the disconnection of basic 
telecommunications services for failure to pay pay-
per-call charges. 
     The statute also specifically exempts from pay-
per-call status "any service the charge for which is 
tariffed," and services offered pursuant to a 
"presubscription or comparable arrangement."
     Ronald Marlowe, an attorney with the Miami law 
firm of Cohen, Berke, Bernstein, Brodie, Kondell & 
Laszio, recently sought an FCC advisory opinion 
concerning the legality of interexchange carriers 
providing telecommunications services to foreign 
audiotex operations. The services would be 
transmitted using the 10XXX + international 
number, 1-500-NXX-XXXX or 1-700-NXX-
XXXX dialing sequences. Calls would be billed to 
telephone subscribers at the tariffed rate as standard 
toll charges. 
     But Marlowe went further. He asked if the 
legality of the arrangement would be affected if:
     1) the carrier remits a portion of the transport 
charge to the party advertising the destination 
number; or
     2) the carrier remits a portion of the transport 
charge to the destination entity for providing the 
information.
     Finally, Marlowe asked whether the 
circumstances described would be legal if the other 
IXCs were blocked from providing access to the 
information provider.
     The FCC responded in a four-page advisory letter 
by John Muleta, chief of the enforcement division. 
But Spangler summed it up by saying the FCC 
thinks that "there is such a close tie between the 
carrier and information provider ...  that in this 
situation it appears the carriers were not acting as 
common carriers but were using an enhanced 
service."
     Spangler added that the "payment of 
commissions appeared to be an attempt to evade the 
definition of pay-per-call service under our rules." 
But it would not be successful, and the information 
services would be required to be accessed through a 
"900" number. One criteria for evaluating whether a 
service is a pay-per-call service is whether the 
consumer pays the provider more than what is 
required to transmit the call. The fact that the IXCs 
would be paying a commission to the information 
provider for the calls would suggest the consumer 
was paying more, said Spangler.

**No common carrier with blocking

     In the letter, Muleta said that by making payments 
to an information provider or destination entity, the 
carrier would "abandon objectivity and acquire a 
direct interest in promoting the delivery of calls to a 
particular number for the provision of a particular 
communication." This would be true, said Muleta, 
regardless of the dialing sequence used to place the 
call. Further, Muleta said any carrier "that is 
involved, either directly or indirectly, in blocking 
access to the called number by other carriers or in 
determining or influencing the content of the 
communications delivered through its network is 
not, we believe, offering a common carrier service."
     The letter also stated that the fact that the 
consumer does not directly pay the information 
provider does not exclude the service from the 
definition of pay-per-call if the payment is simply 
paid to the information provider by the carrier and 
then recovered from the consumer through the 
transport charge. The situation is not comparable to 
payments to pay telephone or other aggregators, said 
Muleta. "Those commissions simply compensate 
aggregators for their costs of making services and 
facilities available to the transient public for its 
communications needs."
     The transport charge discussed in the Marlowe 
letter is "a sham; the consumer has, in fact, paid the 
carrier for transport, and the provider, albeit 
indirectly, for the information," Muleta wrote.

**WKP seeks rehearing

     At least one company interested in providing the 
kind of service described in Marlowe's letter -- WKP 
Communications Inc. -- didn't like Muleta's response 
and has filed with the commission a request for 
review. That request must be approved or denied by 
the five FCC commissioners.
     Meanwhile, the commission has yet to issue a 
final rule concerning "800"/"900" fraud. 
     Back in August 1994 the commission proposed 
to curb the "800"/"900" problem by requiring that a 
written agreement be executed before pay-for-call 
services can be provided through "800" numbers. 
     Spangler said the commission is not likely to rule 
on reconsideration of the Marlowe letter as part of 
the "800" rulemaking. He also predicted that the 
"800" docket would be concluded first.

**International centers come on board

     Meanwhile, the FCC is making some progress in 
dealing with the international audiotex problem, 
particularly when it concerns adult services. 
     International audiotex operations have become a 
source of revenue in some undeveloped countries. 
When a call goes overseas the U.S. carrier pays a 
portion of that call to the foreign carrier. 
     And since the telecommunications industry in 
some of these poorer nations is government-owned, 
a dozen or so nations have been willing to pay a fee 
to overseas providers to get them to relocate (see 
box).
     To address this problem the FCC in April held a 
roundtable discussion with industry. And, in the 
summer four major IXCs agreed to a "verbal 
arrangement"  to forgive bills for foreign pay-for-
service calls where the calls are disputed by 
customers in the first billing cycle, said John Copes 
of the FCC's international division. The carriers that 
have verbally agreed to this are: GTE, MCI, Sprint 
and AT&T.
     Copes said the commission also is trying to get 
nations involved in incoming pay-per-call services to 
agree not to require U.S. carriers to collect for calls 
that are unauthorized or are made by minors. Two of 
the most active countries -- the Dominican Republic 
and Guyana -- have agreed to comply. Copes said 
that discussions are continuing with other nations.

Sample E-Mail Security Policy Statement

     The best way for a company to protect itself from 
abuse of its E-mail system by employees is to set 
out clear, detailed standards and make sure all 
workers who use the system are informed of those 
standards. The sample plan below is an excellent 
model for organizations to follow in setting out 
standards for employees. It was prepared by Michael 
Corby, of M Corby & Associates Inc., 255 Park 
Ave, 9th Floor, Worcester, Mass., 01609-1946.

Memorandum to: All Company Electronic Mail Users
Re: Company Electronic Mail Usage Policy
     One of the more important advances in office 
technology in the last decade has been Electronic 
Mail. The company's E-mail system has given us the 
ability to communicate with one another more easily 
and effectively. With this technology come some 
practices and policies concerning the use of E-mail 
that all company employees need to understand and 
follow:

**Appropriate Usage:

     It is expected that all company associates will use 
E-mail primarily for business reasons and will 
conduct themselves in a fashion that is consistent 
with the company's philosophy of treating others 
with respect and dignity. E-mail communication, 
both within the company or with other companies' 
E-mail systems should follow the same standards 
that are expected in written business 
communications.
* Messages that are defamatory, abusive, profane, 
sexually oriented, threatening, or racially offensive 
are prohibited.
* Messages that serve as advertising or solicitation 
are prohibited.
* Chain letters (a mailing with a request to recipients 
to continue distribution to others) are prohibited.
* The collection and/or transmission of material in 
violation of any federal, state or local law is 
prohibited.
     The inappropriate use of E-mail is a violation of 
company policy and may be subject to disciplinary 
action, up to and including termination of 
employment.

**Ownership:

     All information stored, transmitted, received, or 
contained in the company's E-mail system is the 
property of the company. It is not company policy to 
intentionally inspect E-mail usage. However, there 
may be business or legal situations that necessitate 
company review of E-mail messages and 
documents.

**Privacy:

     Employees should not attempt to gain access to 
another employee's E-mail messages without that 
person's express permission. However, company 
management reserves the right to access all E-mail 
files.

**Confidentiality:

     If there is a need for sensitive or confidential 
material to be sent via the E-mail system, care 
should be taken to route it only to those with a 
legitimate need to know. Any E-mail users has the 
capability to forward any message they receive, or to 
print and circulate a paper copy. In formulating and 
addressing sensitive E-mail messages, you should 
exercise the same discretion you would with any 
written document.
If you have any questions concerning this policy, 
please consult your manager, or contact Corporate 
Information Services, or the Law Department.

Data security problems touch more businesses, lead 
to greater awareness by top management

     More than half of the 1,300 information 
specialists responding to a new Ernst & 
Young/Information Week survey reported security-
related financial losses over the past 12 months.
     The average security losses were in the $250,000 
range. Twenty of those respondents reported their 
companies suffered losses exceeding $1 million.
     The annual survey found that the increased use of 
the Internet and tools for remote access, combined 
with the problems of hackers, former employees and 
overzealous competitors, are putting network 
security at the center of concerns by network 
managers.
     Inadvertent errors were the largest source of 
financial losses, followed by a lack of system 
availability. Virus attacks were experienced by 67% 
of the respondents, up from 59% in the 1994 survey. 
But just 8% of the viruses caused financial losses. 
And 78% of those who experienced virus attacks 
said the viruses were disruptive, but caused no 
financial loss.
     The Internet appeared to be a particular concern to 
the 1,300 responders from a cross-section of 
business and industry, and for good reason. Of those 
using the Internet for exchanging information 
externally, 20% said they were the target of 
successful or attempted break-ins in the past year.
     Forty percent of the Internet business users who 
responded to the survey said they are dissatisfied 
with Internet security. But a full 87% of them said 
they would use the Internet more frequently to 
conduct business if security were enhanced.
     As the charts on this page suggest, there is an 
increase in how seriously top management takes data 
security when compared with earlier Ernst & 
Young/Information Week surveys. Daniel White, an 
Ernst & Young partner who specializes in 
information security, said companies seem 
increasingly willing to devote more resources to 
finding security solutions. For example, 79% of the 
respondents said they have at least one full-time 
information security person on staff, up from 75% in 
1994.
     But most companies surveyed admit that they 
don't have adequate tools or properly trained 
personnel to defend against information security 
losses, White said. Management awareness and 
budget constraints weren't quite the problem in 1995 
that they were in 1994, according to respondents. 
     But frustration with a lack of tools or security 
solutions increased in 1995 over 1994.
     White advises that "information security should 
be decentralized." He said that there is an increase in 
data exchanges among remote locations -- plants, 
warehouses, home or branch offices --  and the 
people in charge locally need to take on effective 
security systems. 
     "To assist in this effort, common guidelines for 
security must be developed centrally and uniformly 
enforced in all locations," he said.

Former law enforcement official arrested in 
computer, phone fraud case

     The Los Angeles Police Department's reputation 
has been tarnished in a number of high-profile cases 
recently.
     Now a retired member of the LAPD is under fire 
for computer crimes. The retired officer and two 
private detectives were charged with accessing 
confidential information from government, private 
utility and private industry computer data banks and 
then selling the information. 
     Retired LAPD detective Robert Muldrew, 48, and 
private investigators Steven Kudler, 35, and David 
Westland, 28, were charged with unauthorized 
computer access, fraudulent telecommunications 
access and conspiracy. A fourth suspect, Joan 
Jayasinghe, an employee of GTE, was out of town 
when warrants were served but voluntarily 
surrendered to authorities upon her return to Los 
Angeles. She was charged with one count of 
computer fraud.
     Muldrew allegedly accessed Department of 
Motor Vehicles data bases and law enforcement data 
bases through a detective's computer terminal at the 
Devonshire Division police station, although the 
detective has not been implicated. Kudler and 
Westland allegedly broke into telephone company 
data bases and stole billing records. They also 
allegedly stole credit reports and customer account 
records from a local bank. 
     L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Efrem 
Grail, after expressing relief that he was receiving 
inquiries about something other than the O.J. 
Simpson verdict, said the defendants were in court 
on Nov. 6 and that the matter, which has been 
continued several times, could be considered on Dec. 
19, while a pre-plea report is being prepared for the 
defendants by the probation board. The defendants 
and the state are in "serious negotiations" and felony 
pleas are expected based on offers made by the state.

Staff Abuse of the Net/Web: A Growing Problem

     When we published our two volume bookset on 
telephone fraud nearly two years ago, we coined the 
phrase "Telabuse" to describe the generally 
overlooked problem of insider abuse of telecom 
systems. 
     Telabuse remains a significant factor, adding well 
over $8 billion to user bills yearly through wasteful 
and inappropriate telephone use by staff. Examples 
include employees dialing "900" and "976" numbers 
on office phones, personal long distance calls from 
work and friends/family interacting with staff 
through the employer's "800" service.
     The explosive growth of Internet and World 
Wide Web use, now easily accessed from most 
workplaces, is leading to a growing problem of 
employer abuse of the Internet/Web, akin to 
Telabuse. I dub the problem "Netabuse." It has 
rapidly become a subject of extreme concern to 
management and security directors. 
     Some recent examples reported in just the last 
two months:
     * A diversified manufacturing concern in the 
Midwest announced the testing of a highly secret 
new product internally to its managers through E-
mail. One manager then posted the message through 
a technical news group on the World Wide Web, 
accessed by all the company's competitors. The 
damage was immense.
     * A manager of a Georgia utility walked into a 
conference room to find nearly a dozen young male 
staffers having a brown bag lunch while viewing 
pornography through the Internet. 
     * A California software concern conducted an 
unannounced audit of Internet usage for one day and 
found 28 employees had spent an average of 3.25 
hours browsing for primarily personal information 
and entertainment. One young employee, smitten 
with stock speculation on high tech IPOs, had spent 
seven hours of his "workday" on personal 
investment research.
     Activities of this sort are common. The problem 
is growing as ease of access continuously improves 
and exciting  choices grow exponentially.  While 
direct costs are minimal, the loss of productivity and 
time can be staggering. A small -- but growing -- 
number of employees is developing  what's closely 
akin to an "addiction" to browsing the Web to satisfy 
instincts or desires involving sports information, 
pornography, investment opportunities and 
developments in technical fields of purely personal 
interest. 
     Experts in the field advise me that abuse of the 
Net/Web and the resulting impact on productivity 
has now become the number two concern, after 
security threats through the Net from the "outside."
     User management needs to address the problem. 
Clear, explicit policies must be formulated, 
distributed and enforced. Security policies and 
protections, which up to recently have only been 
asymmetrical (guarding against intrusions from the 
"outsiders") now must be modified to become 
symmetrical (guarding against outgoing -- as well as 
incoming -- leaks and breaches).
     Users can effectively manage against Telabuse by 
installing "call management" software systems 
available at low cost, starting at less than $1,000. 
These systems block access to "900," "976" and 
other pay-call services as well as monitor for abuse 
and toll fraud. Well over 80% of firms with 
professional telecom managers have now installed 
such systems, which are highly effective. 

**Free market responds

     In our entrepreneurial society, software firms 
respond quickly with solutions to new problems. 
The twin problems of Net/Web abuse and internal 
security leaks through the Internet from insiders 
(whether inadvertent or purposeful) are a very recent 
phenomena. But commercial solutions are already 
available in the marketplace. And -- just as was the 
case with telecom fraud -- the best systems provide 
symmetrical security and management, protecting 
against both external and internal threats.
     Security experts have particularly high praise for 
one such system, called "Sidewinder," available 
since March. Produced by Secure Computing Corp. 
of Roseville, Minn., Sidewinder protects against 
external threats through the use of a firewall 
approach coupled with the user's choice of any 
combination of authorization codes, passwords, IDs 
and smart cards. This is a rather typical approach.
     What differentiates Sidewinder from most 
software security offerings is that it also provides 
control and flexible management tools to allow the 
user to protect against internal abuse and security 
leaks. Employees with access to the system, for 
example, can have limited Internet privileges (e.g. E-
mail only) or full access (E-mail, news groups, Web 
access). 
     Sites to which the user doesn't want access at all 
(e.g. pornography) are blocked. Usage is 
electronically monitored to ensure that the usage and 
security protocols set by the user's management are 
being followed. 
     The cost of a complete system is $30,000. The 
software alone is less.
     Secure Computing Corp. will soon launch less 
expensive systems for smaller users. Competitors 
are announcing software systems that also adopt the 
symmetrical approach. Prices are sure to drop in the 
months to come. 
     Internet software security systems that are mainly 
asymmetrical (protecting only against unauthorized 
access by outsiders) will soon become history. As 
the explosive use of the Net and Web continues to 
grow, so will abuse, by insiders as well as outsiders.

Pick passwords carefully

     Passwords are a way of life in this fast-paced, 
information-based business environment, but they 
are not without dangers.
     Most business people simply can't avoid them 
unless they avoid PBX features such as direct inward 
system access, and also don't use cellular phones, 
voice mail systems, computers and electronic mail.
     Since passwords are so important to keeping 
communications secure, it's worth going to the 
trouble of picking the right ones and administering 
them properly. 
     A large percentage of hackers will move away 
from your telecom system or network if they have to 
work beyond some of the standard entry codes. 
Making codes as long as possible is an important 
deterrent. But long codes don't guarantee security. In 
fact, the longer the code, the greater the likelihood 
that it will be written down and placed in a spot that 
makes it an advertisement for a break in -- on the 
bulletin board at an employee's desk or on a yellow 
post-it note beside the telephone. 
     Find a happy medium. A six-digit code can be 
cracked in less than a half hour with software that 
costs just a few hundred dollars. But a 20-digit code 
is difficult to memorize, in addition to being 
unpopular. Nine-to-12 digit passwords are 
reasonably secure, but still manageable. Group codes 
-- such as one code for everyone in a particular 
department -- should be avoided as authorization for 
any communication systems. If several individuals 
are using the same code it makes it extremely 
difficult for administrators to audit the system and 
track suspect calls.
     System administrators should also be certain that 
codes are changed frequently, in the computer, the 
voice mail system and throughout the telecom 
system and network. Change codes every 30 to 90 
days. Some systems can be designed to alert the user 
on a periodic basis that passwords should be 
changed.
     An extremely important point is for telecom 
managers to be certain to change any default codes in 
the PBX, and make certain those codes are changed 
regularly. Hackers are very familiar with the default 
codes for maintenance and other ports of major 
telecom equipment.
     Security codes should never involve sequential 
digits. Other codes to be avoided include:
     * Common terms, words or sayings
     * Telephone extension numbers
     * Employee identification numbers
     * Social Security numbers
     * Anniversaries
     * Maiden names
     * First names
     * Spouses' names
     If at all possible, telecom managers should assign 
codes to employees rather than letting them 
determine their own access authorization codes. 
Codes should be randomly generated, frequently 
changed, and deactivated as soon as they are no 
longer needed.

Have you used any of these passwords?

1111     2222     3333     4444
1234     9876     4321     1212
3434     1397
     If you answered "yes" to any of these items you 
have essentially unlocked the door of your system to 
hackers, because these are among the most 
commonly used passwords for PBXs, remote 
access, voice mail and other entry points.

Justice official seeks computer ethic, better interstate, 
international coordination

     The Justice Dept.'s six-member Computer Crime 
Unit has its hands full, and the unit's trial attorney 
thinks the problem "is not going to get better anytime 
soon."
     Prosecutor Martha Stansell-Gamm says the 
department is seeing the age of the criminals going 
up. Phreakers and hackers used to be primarily 
teenagers, but they increasingly are now adults in 
their 20s and 30s. The "size of the harm is also going 
up," she said when recently addressing a group of 
data security experts at a Computer Security Institute 
conference in Washington.
     Stansell-Gamm cited statistics from the 
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh that show 
technological intrusions have increased by 498% and 
the number of affected sites has increased by 702% 
since 1991. But she added that there are not sufficient 
statistics to give a true picture of the problem. "For 
every report of computer crime there are nearly 500 
intrusions that we don't hear about," she said.
     Stansell-Gamm applauded CitiBank for being up-
front concerning the diversion of $10 million in 
illegal fund transfers by alleged computer crook 
Vladimir Levin. But she noted that most companies 
are unwilling to admit they have been hit, either 
because they feel it will make them look foolish or 
will somehow make their systems more vulnerable.
     Stansell-Gamm said that the computer crime 
problem is more a problem of ethics than of 
technology. She devotes time to visiting schools and 
talking with young students because she recognizes a 
new privacy ethic has to be developed for the 
computer age. 
     "Right now we just teach how computers work, 
but we don't teach how they hurt." Just as kids watch 
adult drivers to see how they protect themselves and 
others, we need to teach this self-defense and respect 
for other on the information highway, she said.
     Ascertaining the nature and scope of the computer 
crime problem is just one small piece of what the 
Computer Crime Unit does. It's other responsibilities 
are to:
     * Coordinate multi-district, multi-agency 
investigations. This is an important function since 
attacks on technology generally involve more than 
one jurisdiction. Stansell-Gamm cited the case of 
Kevin Mitnick as a good example of this 
coordination. Mitnick, one of the most notorious 
criminal hackers in the United States, was arrested 
early this year in Raleigh, N.C., after a chase that 
began in California. Mitnick has since been 
transferred to Los Angeles and is being prosecuted 
by the U.S. Attorney's Office there, Stansell-Gamm 
said.
     Remedies to the multi-jurisdictional problem have 
included creation of an infrastructure to make sure all 
law enforcement can work together: the 
Computer/Telecommunications Coordinators.
     * Train agents and prosecutors. The crimes the 
unit deals with involve highly technical 
telecommunications and computer issues, which in 
the past meant a "steep learning curve" for 
prosecutors, Stansell-Gamm said. Through the 
efforts of the Computer Crime Unit, there is now 
one prosecutor in each district trained in the 
technology and tough legal issues in this field, 
Stansell-Gamm said. 
     The Computer Crime Unit conducts training 
courses for prosecutors, agents, system 
administrators and agency lawyers. It also has 
published the "Federal Guidelines for Searching and 
Seizing Computers" to aid law enforcement.
     * Develop an international response. Just as 
computer crimes cross state lines, they similarly are 
not hampered by international or geographical 
barriers. But nations have different views of how 
computer activities should be handled and some 
countries do not recognize computer crime as a 
threat. The Computer Crime Unit is trying to 
streamline the methods for obtaining international 
assistance and evidence. The procedures need to be 
in place ahead of time because computer crimes 
occur instantly and the criminals can cover their 
tracks and move on. Stansell-Gamm sees some 
progress in this area but believes that ultimately the 
United States will need to negotiate treaties with 
other nations to deal with the security threat.

Selling security to upper management takes new 
kind of talk

     Many telecom and network professionals may 
understand beefing up security will make a 
difference to the bottom line of their companies, but 
top officials usually don't.
     And in an age of belt-tightening and downsizing, 
few companies are going to be interested in 
investments in "technical niceties." 
     That means that on top of all the technical and 
management responsibilities they must juggle, 
system administrators also had better hone their 
powers of persuasion if they want the backing to get 
the security resources needed to protect 
telecommunications and computer investments.
     Studies, such as the Ernst & Young survey 
outlined in this issue, show company CEOs are 
beginning to give information security more 
consideration. But resources still don't match the 
security risks. And security professionals still have 
trouble helping senior management understand the 
need for security in their own organizations.
     "Techies" often have a tough time getting the 
dollars they need for security measures because they 
don't know how to sell themselves, says Patricia 
Fisher, president of JANUS Software Inc., and 
because technical people and upper management 
speak different languages.
     In a presentation before Computer Security 
Institute's recent conference in Washington, Fisher 
outlined the steps information specialists should 
follow to get the security resources they think their 
organizations need. 
     When making a presentation to upper 
management, the telecom or network administrator 
should:
     * Understand your audience. Do your homework 
and find out as much as you can about the goals and 
concerns of the person you are trying to persuade. 
Also, if you are dealing with upper management, it 
will likely be a challenge to hold the attention of a 
CEO who has hundreds of other concerns. Practice 
presentation skills to keep your audience awake and 
engaged.
     * Outline the topic and what the presentation will 
attempt to accomplish.
     * Provide statistics that show why a policy or 
monetary decision is in the best interest of the 
business. Statistics about the scope of the security 
problem can be persuasive. But they are particularly 
so if they are tailored to the circumstances of your 
specific line of business. 
     * Alternatively, show how the security 
investments could provide an opportunity for your 
company. For example, investments in a firewall for 
communications over the Internet may enable your 
company to feel secure enough to use the World 
Wide Web to increase visibility, and potentially 
increase business.
     * The meat of the presentation should be devoted 
to showing what needs to be done to solve a 
business problem. Do not get into technical 
discussions with high-level officials.
     * Make the presentation balanced. Show the 
obstacles so management can see that you are "not 
just a technical person who wants a technical toy" but 
someone who has thought through the situation and 
is looking out for the best interest of the company.
     * Suggest some realistic alternatives. That way 
management knows they can trust your judgement.
     And Fisher's final piece of advice to security 
professionals who need to make a sales pitch is: 
"practice, practice, practice."
