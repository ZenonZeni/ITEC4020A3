<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Hypereutectic Al-Si Alloy Casting Technology and Its Potential</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
The typical hypereutectic Al-Si alloy freezes over a relatively 
wide temperature range and is characterized by (1) a high thermal 
diffusivity and (2) a high heat of fusion, both of which tend to minimize 
temperature gradients, expand the range where liquid and solid coexists 
in the mushy state, and upon solidifications lead to unfed shrinkage 
sites (i.e. microporosity) to be dispersed throughout the casting. 
Four-cycle engine blocks made with these alloys typically exhibit high 
oil consumption because of the microporosity.

	This presentation examines Mercury Marines patented Mercosil 
Engine Block Technology that solves the problems of the past associated 
with the wide solidification range. The patented Mercosil composition is 
a wear resistant, easily cast, hypereutectic Al-Si alloy of narrow 
solidification range that solidifies with an improved primary silicon 
distribution and an absence of microporosity. A higher silicon content 
version of Mercosil is also patented. This alloy composition has twice 
the wear resistance of Mercosil, and allows automotive the option of not 
having to etch the bores. Because this alloy has a  solidus melting point 
100F higher than conventional hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, the alloy has 
significant potential as a cast-in aluminum alloy liner. Mercury, in 
addition, has patented a high magnesium content version of Mercosil that 
is specifically designed for the lost Foam Casting Process. The alloy 
eliminates the liquid styrene defect and has great potential for 
defect-free automotive Lost Foam engine blocks. The alloy has particular 
value to Mercury Marine in its outboard business because Mercury has also 
patented the two-cycle engine block made by the Lost Foam Casting Process.
