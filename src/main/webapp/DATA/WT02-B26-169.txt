   Objective of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   Recently Large  amount of  spatial data have  been easily  handled due to the significant increase in the computing speed and memory space of workstations and, development of input devices such as scanners, digitizers and storage media such as optical disks.<br>
  The  developed  countries  such as  USA  and  Germany  have  been  using  Geo graphic Information Systems(GIS) which  can manipulate data collection, update, analysis ,  display and data management  in terrain analysis.   Our military forces, having  relatively less computing power, need to develop their own tactical terrain analysis system.<br>
  The objective of this study is to develop a scientific tactical terrain analysis system which can combine GIS, image processing and graphics technology to support field commanders who have to  set up strategic tactics  in battlefield operations.   This terrain analysis  system will reduce uncertainty in troop manenvering,  fire planning, and  communications.  The  accurate information produced  by the terrain analysis system will be able to enhance the combat capability of a military  unit and  efficiency of weapon systems  and also support military officers to make a prompt decision and operation plan. Therefore,  it is  necessary  to build  our own terrain analysis  system  that suits  to  our circumstances.  Especially,  it is important to build Korean menu driven system that can be easily utilized by military officers in operational mode.

   Results of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   The computerized tactical terrain analysis system that has  been developed in this study is to provide military officers with terrain information necessary for  efficient battlefield operation and troop movement.  Thus, the system  puts great emphasis on  user interface for military officers to use this system easily.  In this context OSF/Motif, which is industry standard and has good portability, has been  selected for the user interface. For the Same Reason, X-lib is used for graphics display on X window.<br>
  This System  can be  divided into  three major  sections, which  are the  terrain analysis software, utilities and  graphics editor. The  detailed lists of the  result of this year's study are as follows:<br><br>

    <ul>
    o Analyzing land-surface  including covered area, concealed area,  slope gra dient, contour, elevation, and field mobility<br>
    o Analyzing visible area, communication relay station, RASIT capability<br>
    o Generation 3D perspective view<br>    
    o Analyzing radar coverage<br>
    o Analyzing logistic routes<br>
    o Analyzing atmospheric phenomena, sunrise, sunset, moon phase<br>
    o Analyzing enemy information<br>
    </ul>
