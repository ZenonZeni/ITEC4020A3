<h4><a name="treat">TREAT YOUR FIBROID WITHOUT SURGERY</a></h4><p>

	According to Susan Lark, M.D., about 40% of American women have a benign fibroid tumor in the uterus by the time they reach menopause. “Fibroids are one of the most common female health problems affecting women during their reproductive years,” Dr. Lark says.<p>
	Although uterine fibroids can disturb the quality of life (with pain, excessive menstrual bleeding, infertility) for about 50% of women who have them, less than 0.5% of fibroids ever become cancerous. Through lifestyle and dietary adjustments, most women can avoid a hysterectomy, the conventional treatment for fibroids, states Dr. Lark. Many women in her practice have reported a noticeable decrease in heavy bleeding and menstrual pain and discomfort within 1-2 menstrual cycles after starting her program. Here’s how to do it:<p><br>
	<b>FOODS TO EMPHASIZE.</b> Useful here are whole grain millet, buckwheat, oats, rice, and rye, but not whole wheat. Consume tofu, black, kidney, pinto, lima, and soybeans, chick-peas, fresh, organic vegetables and fruits—especially dried figs, blackberries, bananas, raisins, and oranges, says Dr. Lark.<p>
	<b>NUTS AND SEEDS.</b> Dr. Lark recommends regular consumption of raw flax, pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds, pistachios, pecans, and almonds.<p>
	<b>ANIMAL PRODUCTS.</b> In general, keep your consumption of meat, poultry, and fish to a minimum, emphasizing fish and poultry (without the skin) or no more than 3 ounces of meat daily; avoid these foods altogether if your fibroid is large and uncomfortable.<p>
	<b>OILS.</b> Small amounts of cold-pressed vegetable oils high in vitamin E are best, including corn, olive, canola, or flaxseed.<p>
	<b>FOODS TO AVOID.</b> All milk products should be avoided until the fibroid has dissolved. Severely reduce your intake of all saturated fats, salt, alcohol, refined sugar, and caffeine.<p>
	<b>VITAMINS.</b> Take beta carotene (vitamin A precursor) from vegetable sources (at least 20,000 I.U. daily); vitamin B complex (50-100 mg daily) with additional B6 (up to 300 mg daily); vitamin C (1000-4000 mg daily) plus bioflavonoids (from grape skins, cherries, blackberries, blueberries, pulp and white rind of citrus fruits); vitamin E (400-2000 I.U. daily) from wheat germ, walnut, or soybean oil.<p>
	<b>MINERALS.</b> Dr. Lark recommends taking iron (the “heme” type from meat sources such as liver); nonheme iron must be accompanied by at least 75 mg vitamin C for absorption. In addition, take calcium (minimum of 800 mg day during menstruation); magnesium (400 mg daily); and potassium (99 mg, 1-3 times daily for one week preceding onset of menstruation).<p>
	<b>HERBS.</b> Useful herbs include goldenseal, shepherd’s purse (to help stop excessive bleeding), yellow dock, pau d’arco, turmeric, silymarin (for anemia and liver health), meadowsweet, and white willow bark (for inflammation, pain, and fever).<p>
	<b>ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS.</b> These are the raw materials from which prostaglandins (hormone-like chemicals) are made; they help to relax muscles and blood vessels, thereby reducing cramps and tension. Chief among these are linoleic acid (omega-6 family) and linolenic acid (omega-3 family), found in fresh flax and pumpkinseed oils. Fish oils, from salmon, tuna, rainbow trout, mackerel, and eel, are strong sources of linolenic acid, while safflower, corn, sesame, and wheat germ oils are high in linoleic acid.<p>
	<b>EXERCISE.</b> Regular aerobic exercise, slowly performed,  is important, at least 3 times weekly, states Dr. Lark. Hatha yoga exercises can reduce pelvic congestion, improve blood circulation, and relax uterine muscles.<p>
	<b>STRESS REDUCTION.</b> Useful techniques include meditation, deep-breathing exercises, counseling, psychotherapy, and emotional support from friends and family to ease stressful situations.<p>
	<b>ADDITIONAL TIPS.</b> The following additional tips, courtesy of Carolyn Dean, M.D., will also be helpful in reducing fibroids:<p>

<ul>
	<li> Evening primrose oil, 4 capsules daily;
	<li> Marine lipid capsules, 4 daily;
	<li>Foot reflexology massage;
	<li> Castor oil packs or bentonite clay poultices over the uterine area;
	<li>Herbal formulas including chaste tree berry (Vitex agnus castus), dong quai, licorice root, wild yam (Dioscorea), and sarsaparilla.

</ul>

<h4><a name="put">PUT YOUR STRESS ON CHILL MODE</a></h4>
<font size="-1">With Essential Oils</font><p>

	Here are 3 quick, simple, and effective ways to use the essential oils of aromatherapy to chill out next time you’re feeling tense, according to certified aromatherapist Roberta Wilson, who teaches and practices in California and New Mexico.<p>
	<b>LEAVE YOUR TENSION IN THE BATH.</b> Mix 4 drops lavender, 3 drops marjoram, 2 drops chamomile, and 2 drops cypress oil, and disperse in a bathtub of warm water. Soak yourself in peace for at least 20 minutes.<p>
	<b>KEEP THE COOL CLOSE TO YOUR SKIN.</b> Using 1/8 ounce of jojoba oil as a base, mix in 3 drops of sandalwood, 2 drops rosewood, 2 drops neroli, 1 drop frankincense, 1 drop jasmine, and 1 drop ylang-ylang oil. Daub this mixture lightly on your neck, near your nostrils, or on your stomach for anti-stress; or place in a small bottle so you may sniff it frequently.<p>
	<b>CHILL OUT THE ENTIRE ROOM.</b> Mix 15 drops of lavender, 10 drops clary sage, 10 drops lemon, 8 drops rosewood, 6 drops marjoram, 4 drops geranium, and 2 drops ylang-ylang oil in a small glass container. Cover tightly and allow the oils to settle. <p>
	Then add a few drops to an aromatherapy burner or diffuser to fill the room with a tension-easing aroma. An aromatherapy burner is a small, inexpensive porcelain device with a candle below and a shallow cup above; 5-20 drops of the oils are dribbled into water, then, when heated, the fragrances diffuse into the air.<p>

<h4><a name="quick">QUICK & NATURAL REMEDIES FOR COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS</a></h4> 

	<b>ASTHMA:</b> Daily supplementation with 1000-2000 mg of vitamin C can significantly reduce typical asthma symptoms. This recommendation is supported by the fact that asthmatics tend to have a 50% lower blood concentration of vitamin C than healthy people. The Environmental Protection Agency is now reporting that low vitamin C intake is directly linked with a higher rate of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing.<p>

<p>
	<b>DEPRESSION:</b> Next time depression threatens to bury you, try an extract of St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). In 25 double-blind studies with 1592 patients, St. John’s Wort extract, taken at the rate of 300 mg daily for 4 weeks, brought relief from mild to moderate depression in 65-80% of patients with almost no side effects, says Michael Murray, N.D. In a study with 135 patients, those taking St. John’s Wort had a 56% improvement in their depression compared to 45% for those taking imipramine hydrochloride, a conventional drug. <p>

<p>
	<b>ENLARGED PROSTATE:</b> Instead of reaching for Proscar for prostate enlargement (called benign prostatic hyperplasia), try a combination of saw palmetto and stinging nettle root (urtica) extracts, advises H. J. Schneider, M.D., and his German colleagues. In their study, 2030 patients with enlarged prostate took 320 mg of saw palmetto extract and 240 mg of urtica root extract daily for 12 weeks, after which 86% reported symptom improvement and 79% said they experienced an improvement in their quality of life. Urinary flow improved by 29%, post-voiding dribbling was reduced by 53%, and residual urine retention was reduced by 44%.<p>

	<b>FLU:</b> If your body is telling you it’s on the verge of developing the flu, Marcus Laux, N.D., has a strategy to stop it or at least reduce its effects. Dr. Laux recommends that you take  a thymus glandular extract every day to bolster the immune system, along with daily Echinacea herbal extract and vitamin C (3000-5000 mg daily) with bioflavonoids. If the flu still slips past these immune defenses, Dr. Laux recommends the use of a homeopathic formula called Oscillococcinum (available in health food stores), zinc lozenges, unsweetened licorice, an herbal throat spray called Throat Mist, and Sambucol, a black elderberry herbal extract.<p>

<p>
	<b>HEARTBURN:</b> According to the late naturopathic physician Hazel Parcells, N.D., Ph.D., D.C., if, at the first sign of heartburn, you sip a glass of warm water into which is mixed one teaspoon of baking soda, your heartburn “will go away almost immediately.” The baking soda helps to neutralize the overly acid activity in the stomach.<p>

<p>
	<b>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE:</b> You can dramatically reduce high blood pressure (hypertension) with a daily intake of coenzyme Q10, according to P. Langsjoen, M.D., and colleagues at the University of Texas. Dr. Langsjoen treated 109 patients with an average dose of 225 mg daily of coenzyme Q10 and found a steady increase in the functioning of the cardiovascular system and a decreased need for standard high blood pressure  medications within 1 to 6 months. In fact, 51% of patients were able to discontinue 1-3 different drugs only 4.4 months after starting coenzyme Q10 even though the majority of patients had been dependent on them for at least 9 years.<p>

<p>
	<b>IMPOTENCE:</b> If you suffer from an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, recent studies show that taking Gingko biloba herbal extract at 240 mg daily can change that in 6 months or less, even if previous intracavernous (inside the penis) medications failed. In a recent study of 20 patients who had received this conventional therapy, 100% regained the ability to have a spontaneous and sustained erection within 6 months of Gingko biloba supplementation; blood flow into the penis improved within 3 months.<p>

<h4><a name="surviving">Surviving Chemotherapy</a></h4>

<i>Nutritional Healing Can See You Through</i>

<p>

	If chemotherapy or radiation therapy are unavoidable for treating cancer, Stephen T. Sinatra, M.D., Chief of Cardiology at Manchester Memorial Hospital in Connecticut, has a nutritional recipe to help reduce the debilitating effects of these toxic treatments. Follow this program during the period in which you are receiving chemotherapy and radiation, says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
	<b>24-HOUR JUICE FAST.</b> Start a day-long fast by mixing the fresh juice of half a lemon with one teaspoon of maple syrup in a glass of bottled or purified water.
<ul> 
	<li>For breakfast, drink one glass of cranberry juice; 
	<li>For lunch, drink one glass of apple or carrot juice mixed with wheat grass juice, green barley, or chlorella; 
	<li>For dinner, drink one glass of papaya juice and 2 bowls of hot miso broth; 	
	<li>At bedtime, drink one cup of chamomile, ginger, or Echinacea tea. 
	
</ul>

Do this juice fast for one day, then go to the next step.<p>



<b>NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT.</b> Begin eating a vegan diet, which means no fish, animal, or dairy products.<p>

<ul>

	<li>Drink ginseng tea daily.
	<li>Have at least one cup of miso soup with parsley and shiitake mushrooms every day.
	<li>Drink one serving daily of wheat grass, green barley, or green magma extract.
	<li>Take glutathione (100 mg daily); one Optimum Health multivitamin after each meal; one ImmuBoost	supplement with bioflavonoid complex following each meal; and coenzyme Q10 (30 mg) after each meal. Stay on this program for the full duration of your chemotherapy or radiation treatment and for a few weeks after, says Dr. Sinatra.<p>
