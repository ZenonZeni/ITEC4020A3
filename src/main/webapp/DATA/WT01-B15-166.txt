<BODY><P>
On October 1, the President signed the fiscal year 1997 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, providing $382 million for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM). The President's support and Congress' passage of the Appropriations Act allow OCRWM to proceed with the implementation of its Draft Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan, Revision 1, released in June 1996, which supersedes the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan, dated December 19, 1994. The Plan was published in draft because OCRWM recognizes that it is based on assumptions that may have to be updated and modified, as appropriate.<P>
<P>
The strategy outlined in the revised Plan requires that activities be prioritized to enable OCRWM to assess, by September 30, 1998, the viability of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a site for a deep geologic repository. Upon completion of the Yucca Mountain site viability assessment, implementation of this revised Program Plan would allow the program to proceed toward a formal application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a permit to begin constructing a repository in 2002. Emplacement of nuclear waste would commence in 2010.<P>
<P>
The ability to focus on the most critical scientific and technical questions at the Yucca Mountain site is based on more than a decade of scientific work at the site, which includes extensive surface-based and underground exploration. The approach outlined in the revised Plan will enable the Program to reach a license application for about $1 billion dollars less than the previous Program Plan required.<P>
<P>
With regard to the issue of <A HREF="/pages/resource/facts/storfct.htm">interim storage</A> of commercial and naval reactor spent nuclear fuel, the Administration strongly believes that any siting decision for such a facility must be based on objective science-based criteria, and that such a decision should not be made prior to the completion of the scientific work necessary to determine the viability of the potential repository site at Yucca Mountain. The Administration also believes that, prior to the completion of this scientific and technical work, any activities related to the development of an interim nuclear waste storage facility should be limited to non-site specific design and engineering activities. <P>

The <A HREF="/pages/current/ancmnt.htm">revised program strategy</A> includes a market-driven approach that relies on the private sector for transportation, storage, and waste acceptance services. The approach will allow for the maximum use of private industry capabilities, expertise, and experience in accepting, transporting, and storing commercial spent nuclear fuel. OCRWM plans to develop and implement a competitive procurement process resulting in awards of fixed-price, multi-year, performance-based contracts to obtain needed services and equipment at a reasonable cost. Incentives and flexibility will be offered to encourage innovative private sector approaches. Under this approach, private industry will act for the Department in carrying out certain functions under the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part 961) to accept spent nuclear fuel at utility sites for delivery to a Federal facility.<P>
<P>
The revised strategy also restructures program management activities consistent with a reduced funding level and the Program's refocused priorities. OCRWM's Management Center will provide continued program management and administration support, as well as assistance to the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project as the revised Program Plan is implemented. It will address the crosscutting issues affecting both business centers, and support the Director's office in the overall management and representation of the Program and in the development of program policies and strategies. Efforts will concentrate on improving and updating management systems to ensure the efficient application of scarce resources to program priorities. Emphasis will also be placed on enhancing the ability of the Federal staff to carry out its management responsibilities with reduced contractor support.<P>
<P>
The revised Program Plan is intended to ensure that the momentum that has been achieved by OCRWM will be maintained and enhanced in the years ahead. OCRWM recognizes, however, that the assumptions underlying the revised Plan may prove to be invalid. Should this occur, the revised Program Plan will be modified.<P>
