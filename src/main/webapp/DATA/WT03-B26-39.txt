Professor Keith Runcorn, a founder of modern Geophysics, was murdered in
December 1995 in San Diego, while on a US lecture tour. Professor Runcorn,
aged 73, disturbed a thief in his motel room.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Runcorn pioneered studying the Earth through physics and mathematics.
In particular, he used palaeomagnetic records to clarify the Earth's history.<BR>
<BR>
Runcorn was born in Southport, Lancashire, in 1922, then educated at a local
grammar school and Cambridge. During World War II he studied mechanical
sciences, and in 1943 started work at the Radar Research and Development
Establishment. <BR>
<BR>
In 1946 Runcorn joined Manchester University staff and collaborated with
Professor Patrick Blackett, then working on the origin of the Earth's magnetic
field. Over successive appointments, at Cambridge in 1950 then the University
of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in 1955, Runcorn developed Blackett's magnetometer,
applying it to studying fossil magnetism. Runcorn and colleagues later turned
their new geophysical techniques to the question of continental drift. <BR>
<BR>
Several eminent scientists 'proved' this then-unpopular theory 'impossible'.
Runcorn himself did not initially support the idea. But after further investigation,
Runcorn countered, using American and European rocks of varying geological
ages to establish that continents had moved relative to each other and the
Earth's axis.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1960s and early 1970s, Runcorn conducted conferences under the
auspices of the NATO Advanced Study Institute. This annual series of geophysical
meetings furthered the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne's scientific standing.
Also in the 1960s, NASA appointed Runcorn principal investigator to its
Apollo lunar program, where he greatly developed understanding of the moon's
magnetic field.<BR>
<BR>
His honours include the highest prizes offered to Earth scientists: the
Vetlesen Prize (1971); the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society
(1984); and the John Adams Fleming Medal of the American Geophysical Union.
He was also a member of the prestigious Pontifical Academy of Sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Runcorn lectured widely on his other areas of interest: architecture, plus
art-, national- and religious-history.<BR>
<BR>
A sincere and caring man, Professor Runcorn is survived by his sister and
mother, and many friends and colleagues with whom he kept in touch despite
his frenetic lecture and travel schedule. <BR>
A colleague recently wrote that his reputation as one of the foremost geophysicists
of his generation will persist long after his death, as will memories of
his warmth and sincerity. <BR>
