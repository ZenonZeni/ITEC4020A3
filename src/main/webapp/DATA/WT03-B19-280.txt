Maryborough and District's commitment to developing a strong manufacturing
base is long standing.  From its early days as a pastoral district
and its prominence as a gold mining province, Maryborough is
today a vibrant manufacturing and commercial centre surrounded
by a ring of supporting country towns and a mosaic of agricultural
land and forests.
<P>
The city of Maryborough is the region's main centre, with a population
of 8,000.  The region also encompasses the towns of Avoca, Carisbrook,
Clunes and Dunolly, each with a population of around 1,000, and
a number of smaller settlements whose population, together with
the rural population of the area, is a further 5,500.
<P>
Maryborough is 160 km north-west of Melbourne.  It is served by
excellent road and rail links providing quick and easy access
to these and other industrial and commercial centres and ports.
 An air link to other regions is provided by charter air services
operating through Maryborough's all-weather aerodrome.

<H2>Commitment to industrial development</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/maryb1.gif" align=right>
Maryborough has a strong base of well established and developing
manufacturing businesses, particularly in the book printing, confectionery,
food, meat products, clothing and fabricated metals sectors.
<P>
It has the infrastructure to satisfy most industrial needs.  This
includes electricity, natural gas, good transport services and
telecommunications facilities, an abundant supply of fully treated
water for both domestic and industrial needs and full waste-water
treatment facilities.
<P>
Apart from privately owned industrial land and buildings, Council
has several fully developed estates with inexpensive sites available
for use by new and expanding industries and commercial undertakings.
 It has systems in place to provide a onestop-shop approach and
rapid processing of development proposals.
<P>
Council actively assists new enterprises to become established
within the area.  It provides access to inexpensive finance, designs
and constructs buildings for occupation by new enterprises on
a purchase/lease basis, and assists enterprises in business planning
and in negotiating finance and resource contracts.
<P>
Other industrial areas in the district include estates at Dunolly
and Avoca, and extensive areas in Tullaroop, adjacent to the city
of Maryborough, zoned for industrial use.  All are serviced with
electricity and a reticulated water supply.  Those in Tullaroop
also have natural gas, and in some cases, access to waste-water
treatment facilities.  Significant businesses established in these
areas include a major abattoir and meatworks at Carisbrook, steel
engineering businesses at Carisbrook and Eddington, and concrete
pipe culvert manufacturers at Avoca.
<P>
The Councils responsible for these areas are fully supportive
of industrial and commercial development, and are prepared to
negotiate development proposals on an individual basis.
<H2>Quality of life</H2>

<P>
Maryborough and District offers attractive living conditions and
a superb lifestyle for its residents.
<P>
The towns, smaller settlements and rural holdings of the region,
all of which are within quick and easy access of district workplaces,
provide a range of housing options.  Good quality modern homes
and residential land are available in all areas at prices well
below those that apply in many other provincial areas.
<P>
Health and community services are available throughout the area.
 Through district hospitals at Maryborough, Dunolly and Clunes
and a bush nursing hospital at Avoca, the region provides both
acute and nursing home care.
<P>
As the region's centre, Maryborough offers extensive educational,
medical, commercial and social services for the nearby towns.
 It has a special development school, two secondary colleges,
and a TAFE campus.
<P>
The workforce that enjoys these conditions is stable, reliable
and highly productive, and this is a major attraction for both
new existing businesses.
<H2>Strong in agriculture</H2>

<P>
The district's farmlands support rural enterprises including grain
cropping, sheep and cattle grazing for wool and meat production
and hay production.  The output from these enterprises provides
a solid foundation for a number of value adding industries, and
numerous opportunities to establish new ones.
<P>
The Pyrenees District is widely acclaimed as a wine grape producing
area, and its vineyards, and many others throughout the region,
are being extended to better support eight commercial wineries
whose high quality wines find<B> </B>a ready market throughout
the world.
<H2>Historic and natural attractions</H2>

<P>
Maryborough and Distriet's tourism potential has not been fully
realised and opportunities abound to establish new tourism ventures.
 Major attractions in the area are its festivals, sporting carnivals
and events, its equable, year-round climate, Aboriginal heritage,
gold mining history, sporting facilities, vineyards and wineries,
and its extensive natural forests, renowned for their wildflowers
and native animals.
