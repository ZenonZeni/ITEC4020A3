<H3>Resource Development and the Environment: Opportunities in Economic
Development and Self-Determination for Indigenous Peoples. Oneill Gladue,
Ray Ahenakew, Vern Bachiu, Andrew Nellestyn &amp; Ty Rutzki. </H3>
<P>


The indigenous peoples forming Canada's nine Meadow Lake First Nations
(MLFNs) and the Meadow Lake Tribal Council (MLTC) are conducting a study  on
the feasibility and desirability of hosting a used nuclear fuel storage facility. The
MLTC has also initiated a programme of community consultation and information.<P>

The MLFNs number 9000 people, divided into two linguistically different cultural
groups. Each of the nine MLFNs is fully autnonomous. The MLTC provides policy
formulation, services and support for the MLFNs in health, social services,
education and economic development.The growth of the MLTC population requires
the provision of an extra 150 jobs per year for the next 20 years. The MLTC is
exploring the storage of nuclear fuel as an opportunity to provide long term, quality
employment, full and equal participation in the control and management of the
enterprise, environmental responsibility and sensitivity, and recognition of the
MLFNs' traditional values, culture and lifestyle.<P>
 
The MLTC chiefs commissioned a feasibility and desirability sudy to report on
safety, economic development potential, financing, impact on First Nations
traditions, job creation potential, and to determine whether the MLFN peoples
wanted the project to go ahead. The people of the MLFNs were ecouraged to
participate fully in the information programme and community consultation
activities. Two Economic Development Officers and nine Community Consultation
Assistants were appointed to conduct the surveys and explain the project to the
people. The MLTC also gained experience and knowledge by visiting tribes in the
USA and specialists inside and outside Canada.<P>
 
It was recognised that the MLFNs would need to start educating its own
technologists, scientists, engineers, administrators and managers in order to
become full participants in the Canadian economy. Science and mathematics
curricula are now being developed in schools, and students are being placed in
summer employment positions related to the project, such as environmental
monitoring and geological characterisation.<P>

No decisions on the project will be made until the Canadian government's Federal
Environmental Assessment Review Office has concluded its report on the safety
of the AECL technology involved and until the MLTC has a mandate from its people
to proceed.<P>
