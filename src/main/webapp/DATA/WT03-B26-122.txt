<H3><B>Disturbance By Fire</B></H3>
<HR>

<P>
This is a contentious area for two reasons: the continental datasets
are poor, and the relationships between current fire regimes and
biodiversity status are poorly understood.
<P>
Two simple descriptive statistics were derived for each landcover
type: the relative distribution of area among the five fire seasons
(Winter + Spring, Spring, Spring + Summer, Summer, Summer + Autumn)
and among the three fire frequencies (1-3 years, 5-10 years, and
&gt; 10 years).
<P>
The translation of these statistics into indices of disturbance
was based on the following reasoning that however plausible, is
not yet supported by detailed evidence. We argue that for fire
season, the greatest biodiversity disturbance is likely to result
from fires in the hottest time of the year. Therefore the fire
seasons were weighted for disturbance from Winter + Spring (0)
to Summer and Autumn (4). A three-class rating and score of disturbance
was then calculated as for feral density; low (0-25,*), moderate
(25-50**) and high (&gt; 50, ***).
<P>
For fire frequency, it was argued that the most frequent fires
offer the largest disturbance to biodiversity. Therefore, the
disturbance value of fire frequency classes was weighted as the
frequency; from high (2) for the highest frequency to low (0)
for the lowest frequency. In a similar manner, a numeric measure
was calculated from the mean aggregate product of proportional
areas and the disturbance rating; range 0-100. From this measure
a three-class rating and score of disturbance was then calculated;
low (0-25,*), moderate (25-50**) and high (&gt; 50, ***). The
respective fire disturbance scores are set out in Table 17.<HR>
