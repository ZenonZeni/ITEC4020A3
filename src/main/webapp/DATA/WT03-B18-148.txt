<P>Aspiration is the introduction of liquid into the lungs. It is almost
always an accidental process involving a single dose and it may occur directly
or indirectly. When it occurs directly liquids 'go down the wrong way',
i.e. they enter the respiratory tract rather than the digestive tract and
so find their way to the lungs. Aspiration frequently occurs indirectly
when hydrocarbon liquids are swallowed, following which vomiting occurs
as a natural reaction, and it is this secondary effect that may result
in liquid entering the respiratory tract. </P>

<P>The only class of substances that has received significant study in
terms of the effects of aspiration are hydrocarbons. Animal experiments
were performed by Gerarde and reported in 1963. He found that aspiration
of as little as 0.1 ml kerosine could be lethal to rats. In contact with
the lungs, light hydrocarbons spread rapidly and cause lung inflammation
which is referred to as 'chemical pneumonitis'. The latter condition develops
rapidly and it can be fatal for humans, just as much as for animals. Whereas
for gasoline a single lethal dose for adults would be about 400 ml if swallowed,
a much lower volume (perhaps 2 to 3 ml) could prove fatal, if aspirated.</P>

<P><I>Which petroleum products present an aspiration hazard?<BR>
</I>Gerarde found that all petroleum products having a viscosity below
45 SSU (Saybolt Seconds Universal) at 100&#176;F (37.8&#176;C)-equivalent
to 7 cSt at 40&#176;C-presented an aspiration hazard. In addition to individual
hydrocarbons he found that the normally-marketed products such as gasoline,
kerosine, diesel fuel, home heating oil and hydrocarbon solvents could
all cause mortality in animals by aspiration. However, a medicinal product
such as liquid paraffin was too viscous to cause significant effects, even
if it managed to reach the lung by aspiration. </P>

<P><I>Human experience of aspiration<BR>
</I>Analysis of hospital admissions has revealed that human exposure by
aspiration almost always occurs in domestic situations through the accidental
swallowing of petroleum products and subsequent vomiting. Such incidents
most frequently involve young children who are particularly at risk since
low doses can have serious effects. The temporary storage of solvents or
fuels in drinks containers can result in such incidents. A further obvious
adult activity that carries an aspiration risk is siphoning gasoline.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>EMERGENCY&nbsp;TREATMENT</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>For those involved in the emergency treatment of patients who have swallowed
petroleum products, the primary advice is that vomiting must not be induced
since this clearly carries the additional risk of secondary aspiration
of liquid into the lungs. The emergency treatment of patients who have
experienced aspiration is even more important. The key step is to obtain
medical attention immediately and make sure that the casualty is sitting
in a half upright position.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CLASSIFYING&nbsp;AND&nbsp;LABELLING&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;THE&nbsp;ASPIRATION&nbsp;HAZARD</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The recognition of the need to classify and label petroleum products
for their aspiration hazard followed from industry pointing out this effect
to the Technical Progress Committee (TPC) of DG XI. Accordingly, since
ingestion was the route of exposure, the TPC determined that certain low
viscosity petroleum substances would be classified as 'Harmful' and would
be labelled with risk phrase R22 ('Harmful if swallowed') and safety phrase
S62 ('If swallowed, do not induce vomiting: seek medical advice immediately
and show this container or label'). Legislation was enacted in the shape
of directive 94/69/EC, the 21st adaptation to Technical Progress (ATP)
of the Dangerous Substances Directive (DSD) requiring the classification
and labelling of 142 gasoline naphthas and 31 kerosines, this to be implemented
in the EU by 30 September 1996. </P>

<P>Even when the 21st ATP was agreed in September 1994, members of the
TPC realized that there was a need for aspiration to have a separate hazard
classification with its own criteria, and work commenced almost immediately
on this subject.</P>

<P>Eventually, such criteria were defined and it was agreed that, for petroleum
substances and certain preparations that met the criteria, the classification
would be 'Harmful' and that labels would carry the risk phrase R65 ('Harmful:
may cause lung damage if swallowed') and the safety phrase S62. This requirement
is embodied both in the 22nd ATP of the DSD and the 4th ATP of the Dangerous
Preparations Directive (DPD). Both directives have to be introduced into
Member States' national legislation by 31 May 1998, but some competent
authorities are permitting the immediate use of R65 rather than R22. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>ASPIRATION&nbsp;HAZARD&nbsp;CRITERIA</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The aspiration hazard criteria for petroleum substances and preparations
are summarized as follows:</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Table7-1.gif" HEIGHT=133 WIDTH=552></P></CENTER>

<P>Other important points relating to this legislation are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Aspiration is a stand-alone effect and cannot be regarded as additive
with any other toxicological effect, under the DPD. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Consumer products presenting an aspiration hazard must be supplied
in containers having child-resistant closures.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>The publication of the 22nd ATP, directive 96/54/EC and the criteria
for R65 means that suppliers must 'self-classify' their products for their
aspiration hazard and denote this in their labels and safety data sheets.
