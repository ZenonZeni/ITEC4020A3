<H3>5. Energy Services Companies Provide Retrofit Services With Immediate 
Energy Savings</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Efforts to improve energy efficiency in buildings are often obstructed by 
the divergent priorities and incentives of the building industry. Lack of 
coordination between architects, building engineers and subcontractors, 
lenders, owners, tenants, and the operations and maintenance staffs of 
large commercial buildings often results in a failure to capture potential 
energy efficiency savings.<a href="#225" name="r225"> [ 225 ] </a>
<p>     Energy Services Companies (ESCos) are in the business of designing 
and installing energy-efficiency systems in buildings, typically on a 
performance contract basis. Performance contracts allow businesses and 
building owners to upgrade their facilities without sacrificing scarce 
financial resources up front. ESCo performance contracts guarantee a 
positive financial return from efficiency upgrades throughout the contract 
term. ESCos often bundle their services with private bank financing 
packages that provide a net positive cash flow from energy savings from 
day one of efficiency installations. <BR>
<p>     ESCos typically conduct an initial audit of a building, and then 
implement a multi-stage retrofit involving lighting upgrades, automation 
and control systems, temperature control systems, improved HVAC systems, 
building envelope and windows upgrades, and microprocessor-based energy 
management control systems for monitoring overall system efficiency. 
Additional ESCo services include indoor air quality diagnostics, 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement, maintenance of equipment and 
controls, and on-site training of employees in order to optimize building 
performance and energy savings.<a href="#226" name="r226"> [ 226 ] </a>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="Honeywell,Inc.">Honeywell, Inc.<a>, Inc.</B></I> Honeywell, headquartered in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, is the largest U.S. ESCo. Honeywell has 
retrofitted buildings and facilities throughout the U.S. with 
energy-efficiency technologies and processes, including federal, state and 
local governments, schools, hospitals, commercial buildings and 
industries. Honeywell uses performance contracting, and bundles its 
services with private bank financing that guarantees a neutral or positive 
cash flow from efficiency upgrades. Most often, actual energy savings far 
exceed the performance guarantee, with all additional energy savings 
accruing to the customer.<BR>
<p>    <p>      In 1990, Honeywell contracted with the City of Seattle, 
Washington to install efficiency upgrades in the Seattle Municipal 
Building. Honeywell replaced old lighting with new electronic ballasts and 
T-8 fluorescent lamps. Automated centralized lighting controls and 
occupancy sensors reduced the hourly energy used for lighting from 400 
kilowatt-hours to 224 kilowatt-hours. To improve poor indoor air quality, 
Honeywell installed a new high-efficiency air filtration system and new 
fan coil units. In the first two years, the upgrades cut building energy 
use by 2,483 megawatt-hours - an energy savings of 62 percent. These 
savings avoided 345 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, 
equivalent to removing 76 cars from the road.<a href="#227" name="r227"> [ 227 ] </a>
<p>     ESCos will play an increasing role in the future, both in the 
buildings sector and in a restructured utility industry, because of their 
ability to package capital with design expertise, serving to improve their 
clients' bottom line. Government facilities, private businesses, public 
housing and potentially private residences can benefit from ESCo 
services.<BR>
