<p><strong>Our Strategy</strong>
<P>
To meet the challenge before us, the National Photovoltaics Program uses a four-pronged
strategy: First, we work in close concert with industry and other stakeholders to develop specific
goals that serve as significant milestones on the path to achieving a PV technology competitive
with other sources for generating electricity.  We concentrate on applications ranging from high-value consumer products, international and remote projects, buildings, utility distribution,
peaking power, and, finally, bulk power markets. 
<P>

<P><BR>
Second, we use a vertically integrated development process to bring
technologies from the concept stage to commercial readiness. This process has feedback loops
along the way and includes basic research, applied research, engineering, product development,
and manufacturing refinements before it finally results in a new commercial product.
<P>
Third, all along this development process, we collaborate closely with R&D partners from
government, industry, and universities. This lends stability to the program and leverages the
expertise, funds, and facilities of the partners. 
<P>
Finally, we validate the technology for specific applications by deploying prototype systems and
documenting their performance.
