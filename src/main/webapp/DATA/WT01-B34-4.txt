<p>BIBLIOGRAPHY ON MARIJUANA<br>
</p>

<p>submitted by Dr. Eric A. Voth, MD, of Drug Watch International
</p>

<p>5/27/96 </p>

<p>How this document got here: </p>

<p>I was in some private discussions with Dr. Voth, who is a
vehement opponent of the legalization of marijuana. In the course
of our discussion I pointed to the research which I already have
on this website and asked Dr. Voth to supply any research or
references which would support his point of view. It took a lot
of pestering, but finally Dr. Voth submitted the following
bibliography on marijuana. </p>

<p>What is most curious about this bibliography is that much of
it does not support Dr. Voth's point of view. It honestly makes
me wonder if he has read the books on his own list. I have
specifically asked him about a few of the books listed here, such
as the <u>Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs</u>,
but he has never given any indication that he has read them. If
Dr. Voth will respond with a list of the ones he claims to have
read, I will post that, too. </p>
