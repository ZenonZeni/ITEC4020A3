<b>Re:  Comments on CALEA Capacity Notice, 60 Fed. Reg. 53643 (Oct. 16, 1995)</b>
<p>
Dear Mr. Worthley:
<p>
We hereby submit the following comments in response to the referenced notice.
<p>
<h2>I.	Overview</h2>
<p>
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, Public Law 103-414) granted the FBI an unprecedented new role in the design of our Nation's telecommunications networks to accommodate electronic surveillance.  In order to protect against abuse, and in order to ensure that the privacy and security of the networks are not compromised, Congress balanced this authority with a detailed public process to ensure oversight and accountability.  
<p>
The FBI's October 16, 1995 Notice of Proposed Surveillance Capacity Requirements fails to meet the public oversight and accountability requirements of the statute.  We urge the FBI to issue a revised notice to include essential information necessary to comply with the public accountability requirements of CALEA and allow interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's proposal. 
<p>	
A basic question posed by the FBI's October 1995 notice is whether the amount of capacity being proposed is justified in terms of law enforcement's projected needs.  So far, given the ambiguities in the proposal and the FBI's failure to disclose its supporting data, it is impossible to answer that question -- it is impossible to say whether or not the capacity requirements proposed in the notice are justified.
<p>     
Therefore, we must conclude that the FBI's notice is deficient.  The FBI has not yet made available to the public the information necessary for substantive comment on this capacity proposal.  Although the Bureau indicated that such information would be publicly available in advance of the January 16, 1996 comments deadline, the FBI has yet not disclosed:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The factual basis for its proposal, consisting of the historical baseline of surveillance activity, and projections therefrom; 
<P>
<li>Certain details of the proposal that CALEA itself requires to be published, namely, the actual number of expected future surveillances and the geographic locations affected; nor, 
<p>
<li>The definition of a key term, "engineered capacity."  
</ol><p>	
The FBI must make public the basis for, and the details of, its request, as Congress intended, before implementation of CALEA can proceed.  No funds should be appropriated for compliance, nor should carriers be obligated to build increased capacity, until: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>The government has disclosed full information about its proposal;  and,
<p>
<li>Interested parties have been afforded a meaningful opportunity to assess the reasonableness of the capacity proposal.
</ol><p>
A notice of capacity requirements without the above information does not conform to the statute as Congress intended,  nor does it well serve the goal of ensuring public confidence in law enforcement surveillance practices.
<p>
<h2>II.	Public Oversight and Accountability Are a Central Element of CALEA</h2> 
<p>
CALEA is a carefully crafted statute, intended to balance the needs of law enforcement with public concerns over privacy  and security of the nation's telephone system, while not impeding innovation <a href = "#fn1>1</a>.
<p>
In conferring on law enforcement a role in the design of telecommunications systems, and in imposing new functional requirements on telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, Congress was concerned about maintaining the privacy and security of the nation's telecommunications system. Congress sought to address this issue by several mechanisms, including the creation of a public process for determining law
enforcement's surveillance requirements both in terms of capability and capacity <a href = "#fn2">2</a>.  This process was intended to allow privacy advocates and other concerned individuals to have a substantive voice in the compliance process.  The public accountability provisions of CALEA are essential to ensuring that law enforcement and the industry do not take actions that expand surveillance authority or jeopardize the privacy and security of communications not authorized to be intercepted.
<p>
As Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), co-author of CALEA, emphasized during the August 11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:
<p>
<blockquote>"To allay public concern over the breadth of wiretapping in America, the entire [compliance] process remains subject to public scrutiny, oversight, and accountability. This bill accomplishes this by requiring any standards or technical requirements that industry adopts to ensure wiretap capability be publicly available." (S. HRG. 103-1022, page 111)</blockquote>
<p>
Public accountability is so important to the legislative scheme embodied in CALEA because the statute granted law enforcement a substantial, unprecedented role in the design of new telecommunications systems, equipment and features.  Under CALEA, for the first time ever, telephone companies were required to ensure that their systems satisfied certain law enforcement requirements.  While the development of solutions to maintain traditional interception capabilities was left to industry, it was expected that there would be close consultation between law enforcement and the telecommunications carriers and their suppliers to determine compliance with the requirements.
<P>
CALEA also requires the companies to ensure that their systems have a certain capacity to accommodate simultaneous law enforcement interception requests (CALEA, Section 104 (a)(1)(A). <a href = "#fn3">3</a>.  In terms of capacity, the statute requires even greater specificity on the part of law enforcement to specify precisely what its capacity needs are  <a href = "#fn4">4</a>. 
<p>
<h2>III.	The FBI's Notice Does Not Satisfy the Public Accountability Objectives of CALEA</h2>
<p>
A fundamental principle of CALEA was that it would merely preserve -- and not expand -- traditional law enforcement surveillance capabilities as they existed before the introduction of digital telephony and other advanced features <a href = "#fn5">5</a>.  CALEA requirements were to be based on past levels of surveillance and projections from those levels.  The Deputy Attorney General has recently reconfirmed that the government intends CALEA to produce no increase in surveillance activity.
<p>
Accordingly, the first step in implementation of the law is to determine the past and current needs of law enforcement, as a basis for projecting future needs.  The FBI clearly has accepted this proposition, for its notice states that the proposed capacity requirements are based on a "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity," derived from reports from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement agencies, and other government entities.  This data has never been collected before.  In the view of the FBI, it provided the starting point for determining what law enforcement's future needs would be.
<p>
Likewise, this baseline data provides a critical basis for the public to evaluate the proposed requirements.  Yet the notice does not disclose either the baseline data or the projections from it.
<p>
A full exposition of the factual basis for the proposed capacity requirements is necessary to implement another component of accountability in CALEA: government reimbursement of capacity costs.  While CALEA authorized funds for implementation, Congress required the FBI to seek yearly appropriations of those funds.  That process allows Congress to have an on-going role in CALEA implementation.  Congress, with public participation, must determine if law enforcement's requests are reasonable, and provide funds accordingly.  The appropriations process also: 
<p>
<ol><li>ensures that the public is aware of the actual costs of government surveillance capacity; and, 
<p>
<li>offers another opportunity for interested parties to challenge law enforcement's surveillance capacity requests.  
</ol><p>
This process will be hampered if the public does not have available the factual information and details making clear what the proposal means.
<p>
<h2>IV.	The FBI's Notice Does Not Satisfy the Express Requirements of CALEA</h2>
<P>
Under CALEA, the FBI is required to determine capacity requirements through a notice and comment procedure (Section 104 (a)).  Congress was very specific in requiring how that process should be conducted <a href = "#fn6">6</a>.  Congress required the FBI to consult with state and local law enforcement agencies.  The FBI has done this.  Congress required the FBI to consult with telecommunications carriers, providers of support services, and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment.  The FBI is doing this.
<p>
But there are two further requirements that the FBI is not complying with.  Congress required the FBI to set forth in its notice "the actual number of communications interceptions, pen registers and trap and trace devices . . . that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies . . .  may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years after the date
of enactment."  (CALEA, Section 104(a)(1)(B)). The notice does not include these projected numbers.
<p>
Congress also required that the notice "identify, to the maximum extent possible, the capacity required at specific geographic locations, including carrier office locations." (CALEA, Section 104 (a)(2)(B)).  Again, the notice does not include this statutorily-mandated information.
<p>
<h3>Private Negotiations With Individual Carriers Cannot Substitute for the Explicit Requirements of CALEA.</h3>
<p>
The FBI's apparent intent to negotiate directly with individual carriers, as described in the October 16 Notice,  is directly contrary to the intent of the CALEA and directly violates the public accountability requirements of the statute <a href = "#fn7">7</a>.
<p>
<h3>The Notice is Ambiguous</h3>
<p>
The notice also fails to clearly define a key term, "engineered capacity."  A precise definition of this term is critical to enable the public to accurately assess the scope of the FBI's request. 
<p>
The notice itself defines "engineered capacity as the "maximum number of subscribers that can be served" by a particular switch or other facility.  Subsequent to the issuance of the notice, the FBI has indicated informally that it actually intended "engineered capacity" to refer to the maximum number of subscribers that can be served "simultaneously" by a particular switch or system.
<p>
Because the FBI has proposed to require carriers to reserve a portion of the "engineered capacity" of particular facilities and features for use by law enforcement, the precise definition of "engineered capacity" greatly influences the scope of the FBI's proposed surveillance capacity.  This term must be clearly defined in order to allow interested parties to assess the FBI's request.
<p>
<h2>V.	Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The October 16, 1995 Federal Register notice of proposed capacity requirements does not contain critical information necessary for interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the proposal:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The notice does not disclose the historical baseline data that provide a crucial predicate to the proposal.
<p>
<li>The notice does not describe how the proposed capacity levels correspond to historical surveillance activity.  It is clear that the FBI made some projection from past activity, but, lacking the historical baseline and the methodology for extrapolation to the future,  there is no way to determine whether the projection is reasonable.
<p>
<li>The notice does not specify the "actual number "of expected future intercepts, as required by the statute.
<p>
<li>The notice does not designate the geographic areas to which the capacity requirements apply, again in contravention of CALEA's requirements.
<p>
<li>The notice does not clearly define a key term, "engineered capacity."
</ul><p>
For these reasons, we believe that the proposed notice does not conform to the statutory requirements of CALEA. We recommend that the FBI issue a revised notice with the requested additions, or issue a supplemental notice. Until the FBI complies with the public accountability provisions of the statute and provides interested parties with the information necessary to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's capacity request, Congress should not authorize any funding to cover capacity modifications and telecommunications carriers should not be obligated to comply with the proposed capacity requirements.

<b>1</b>. This point is detailed in the legislative history of CALEA: "Therefore, the bill seeks to balance three key policies: (1) to preserve a narrowly focused capability for law enforcement agencies to carry out properly authorized intercepts; (2) to protect privacy in the face of increasingly powerful and personally revealing technologies; and (3) to avoid impeding the development of new communications services and <a name = "fn2">technologies". House Comm. on the Judiciary, Report to Accompany HR 4922, H.R. Doc. No. 827, 103d Cong., 2nd Sess. 13 (1994).</a>
<p>
<b>2</b>.  Congress detailed the public accountability provisions of CALEA in the Judiciary Committee Report:  "Finally, the bill has a number of mechanisms that will allow for Congressional and public oversight. The bill requires that the government estimate its capacity needs and publish them in the Federal Register. The bill requires the government, with funds appropriated by Congress in the normal appropriations process, to pay all reasonable costs incurred by industry in retrofitting facilities to correct existing problems. It requires the Attorney General to file yearly reports on these expenditures for the first six years after date of enactment, and requires reports from the General Accounting Office in 1996 and 1998 estimating future costs of compliance. It requires that the government to reimburse <a name = "fn3">carriers, with publicly appropriated funds, in perpetuity for the costs of expanding capacity to meet law enforcement needs. Furthermore, all proceedings before the FCC will be subject to public scrutiny, as well as Congressional oversight and judicial review."  Id. at 19 - 20.</a>
<p>
<b>3</b> The Attorney General, within 1 year from the date of enactment, <a name = "fn4">must publish in the Federal Register "notice of the actual number of </a>communications interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices" that government agencies will conduct 4 years from the date of enactment. CALEA,  Section 104 (a)(1)(A)  
<p>
<b>4</b> FBI Director Louis Freeh emphasized this point during an August 11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on CALEA: " Because telecommunications industry representatives have expressed a concern that administration's proposal did not specifically address the capacities requirements that would be placed on each carrier, we developed, and this legislation includes, provisions which clearly place the affirmative responsibility on the Attorney General to advise carriers of law enforcement's specific capacity requirements within the first year after enactment of the legislation. These provisions will furnish carriers both with our short-term needs and our longer range capacity requirements such that the required capacity will not be needlessly undersized or oversized." Digital Telephony and Law Enforcement Access to Advanced Telecommunications <a name = "fn5">Technologies and Services:  Joint Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Technology and the Law of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary ,103d Cong., 2nd Sess. 116 (1994)</a>
<p>
<b>5</b> From the Committee Report on CALEA: "The FBI Director testified that the legislation was intended to preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law enforcement no more and no less access to <a name = "fn6">information than it had in the past. The Committee urges against overbroad interpretation of the requirements." (ibid., page 22).</a>
<p>
<b>6</b> "The Attorney General is given flexibility in determining the form of the notice.  For example, the notices may be in the form of a specific number for a particular geographic area, or generally applicable formula based on the number of subscribers served by a carrier. However, the notices must <a name = "fn7">identify, to the maximum extent possible, the capacity required at specific geographic locations, including carrier office locations. (emphasis added)" (ibid., page 25)</A>
<p>
<B>7</B> Section 104  of the statute requires the Attorney General to publish law enforcement's capacity requirements in the Federal Register. Nowhere in this section is the FBI authorized to publish those requirements and then negotiate separate compliance arrangements with individual companies.
