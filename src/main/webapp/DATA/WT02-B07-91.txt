Digital 	Telephony Implementation<br></h3>

<h3>I.	 Overview</h3>
<p>
<p>
<font size = +1>In October of 1994 Congress enacted the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) (PL 103-414), also known as the 
"Digital Telephony" legislation.  The statute requires telecommunications 
carriers to ensure that their systems contain sufficient capability and capacity 
to permit law enforcement to conduct electronic surveillance.   Although law 
enforcement officials must still obtain a search warrant in order to conduct a 
wiretap, the statute granted law enforcement new authority to influence the 
design of telecommunications networks. This authority must be closely 
monitored to ensure that law enforcement does not abuse the powers granted 
to it under the statute.
<p>
The statute also contains specific new statutory privacy protections for 
transactional records generated by online electronic communications services, 
prohibitions on pen register authority to gather location information, and 
greater protection for cordless telephones. Furthermore, the statute contains 
provisions which require public accountability and oversight over 
government design authority, telecommunications carrier liability, standards 
setting, and cost reimbursement.
<p>
The expanded law enforcement authority granted by this statute requires 
diligent use of the provisions designed to protect privacy and ensure public 
accountability.   The Center for Democracy and Technology both on its own 
and with the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (a coalition of 
public interest organizations, representatives from the telecommunications, 
computer, online services, and software industries and associations, 
coordinated by CDT) will vigorously monitor the implementation of the 
Digital Telephony statute. CDT stands ready to intervene before the Federal 
Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards 
bodies charged with setting technical standards for implementing the 
requirements, and at other points as necessary to ensure that privacy is 
protected and public accountability is enforced.
<p>
This document will describe the provisions of the statute that specify 
obligations on government and telecommunications carriers. Among the 
these points, perhaps the most critical is that the statute is specifically not self 
implementing.  No tax-payer funds can be spent under the statute until the 
government completes specific procedures (detailed below), each of which 
provides an opportunity for public oversight and intervention.  
<p>
In addition, the statute contains other important public oversight and 
accountability provisions. Among these:
<p><ul>
<li>Requirements for notice and public comment before and after law 
enforcement requests surveillance capacity from telecommunications 
carriers,
<p>
<li>Technical standards for meeting the requirements of the statute must be 
set by industry standards setting-bodies, not the government,
<p>
<li>Technical standards developed under the statute can be challenged by the 
public for any reason in a proceeding before the FCC,
<p>
<li>Detailed reports by the Attorney General and Comptroller General of the 
costs and scope of compliance,
<p></ul>
Finally, the statute requires the government to reimburse 
telecommunications carriers for capacity upgrades, as well as capability 
upgrades where compliance is not "reasonably achievable."   The legislation 
authorized, but did not appropriate, $500 million for this purpose.  If Congress 
fails to appropriate funds to cover reimbursement, telecommunications 
carriers will not be required to comply with all the requirements of the 
statute.
<p>
<a name = "status">These procedures must be closely monitored to ensure </a>that the privacy is protected and that law enforcement does not abuse the powers granted to it under the statute.
<p>
<p>
<h3>II.	Current Status of Appropriations 
Process</h3>
<p>
<p>
The specific method of financing CALEA implementation, as well as the total 
1996 outlay, have not yet been determined.  However, regardless of 
Congressional Appropriations decisions or the sum of appropriated funds, no 
funds can be spent under the legislation until the Attorney General 
determines which telecommunications carrier's networks require upgrades 
or changes in order to comply with the statute.
<p>
<a name = "compliance>The Administration recommended in its 1996 
</a>budget to fund the program through a 30-percent surcharge on civil 
monetary penalties and criminal fines at a level of 100 million dollars 
for the first year, though at the time of this writing no final proposal 
has been introduced.
<p>
<p>
<h3>III.	Compliance</h3>
<p>
For the purposes of the statute, a 'telecommunications carrier' refers to "any 
person or entity engaged in the transmission or switching of wire or 
electronic communications as a common carrier for hire" (Sec. 102 (8)). This 
definition is intended to include local exchange carriers, cellular and PCS 
carriers, and those persons or entities which the FCC determines provide a 
replacement for a substantial portion of the local exchange market (Sec. 102 
(8)(B)). The requirements of the statute do not apply to information service 
providers, private networks, or equipment, facilities, or services whose sole 
purpose is interconnecting telecommunications carriers (Sec 103 (b)).
<p>
In determining how appropriated funds will be spent under the statute, the 
Attorney General must complete a series of studies and consultations, and 
provide notice to telecommunications carriers and to the public. These 
provisions of the statue are outlined below.
<p>
The statute separates compliance into two categories: <b>capacity</b> (i.e., 
the ability of a system to accommodate a specified number of intercepts, pen 
register and trap and trace devices), and <b>capability</b> (i.e., the ability to 
meet the capability requirements of the statute (sec. 103, see below)).  
<p>
The process for telecommunications carrier compliance with the capability 
requirements, and the obligations on law enforcement will be discussed first.
<p>
<h3>A.	Capability Requirements</h3>
<p>
Section 103 of the statute requires telecommunications carriers to meet four 
functional requirements to enable law enforcement to conduct electronic 
surveillance.  These requirements are to:
<ol>
<li>expeditiously isolate and enable the government to intercept all wire and 
electronic communications within a carrier's network;
<p>
<li>expeditiously isolate and enable the government to access call-identifying 
information;
<p>
<li>deliver intercepted communications and call-identifying information to a 
location specified by the government (but only with the affirmative 
intervention of the telecommunications carrier).  Remote monitoring is 
explicitly prohibited; 
<p>
<li>to meet these requirements in a way that protects the privacy and security 
of communications and call-identifying information not authorized to be 
intercepted.</ol>
<p>
<b>Compliance with Capability Requirements</b>
<p>
Telecommunications carriers have four years to comply with the capability 
requirements. However, before a carrier is responsible for making any 
changes to its network, the government must first determine what specific 
capabilities it needs, and consult with the telecommunications industry. The 
telecommunications industry, through standards bodies, must develop 
technical standards to meet the capability requirements, and these standards 
can be challenged before the FCC if any person believes they do not adequately 
protect privacy or fail to meet other requirements. 
<p>
Below is an outline of the capacity compliance process, including a detailed 
accounting of the obligations on the government and telecommunications 
carriers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Government Prohibited from Requiring Specific Design of Features 
or Services:</b> The statute specifically prohibits the government from 
requiring a telecommunications carrier to adopt specific design features or 
systems configurations, or to prohibit a carrier from deploying any feature or 
service that does not meet the requirements (section 103 (d)). Technical 
standards developed to meet the requirements outlined above must be 
created by telecommunications trade associations or standards setting bodies, 
in consultation with the Attorney General (sec 107 (a)(1)). 
<p>
<li><b>Consultation Required before Standards Setting Process:</b>  The 
consultation process required under section 107 (a) must occur before any 
standards are developed.  The beginning stages of the consultation have 
begun through the TILU process described above. Telecommunications 
carriers have 4 years to comply with the capability requirements, and then 
only subject to reimbursement for modifications which are not "reasonably 
achievable" under section 109 (a).</ul>
<p>
<b>Public Accountability and Privacy Protecting Provisions With Respect to 
Standards Setting</b>
<p>
The statute provides several opportunities for public intervention with 
respect to standards setting, including a requirement that standards be 
publicly available and an opportunity for any person to challenge a standard 
before the FCC.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Public Oversight of Standards Setting Process: </b> A 
telecommunications carrier is in compliance with the statute if it is in 
compliance with publicly available standards set by trade associations or 
standards-bodies (section 107 (a)(2)).  Because these standards must be publicly 
available in order for a carrier to be in compliance (section 107 (a)(2)), the 
public will have the opportunity to examine these standards.
<p>
<li><b>Public Intervention before FCC: </b> If the standards are deficient, 
particularly in terms of privacy protection, network security, cost to 
ratepayers, or for any other reason, any person can petition the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) to hold a rulemaking to establish 
standards. In setting standards under this provision, the FCC must ensure 
that the standards: 
<p>
<ul><li>Protect the privacy and security of communications not authorized 
to be intercepted, and
<p>
<li>Minimize the cost of such compliance on residential ratepayers.</ul>
</ul><p>
This provision provides a lever of public accountability for the assistance 
requirements of the statute (sec 103), and, if properly utilized, will help to 
ensure that technical standards for meeting these requirements to not 
unnecessarily diminish privacy or increase costs to consumers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Privacy Protections Must be Considered at Design Stage: </b> 
Technical standards set under the assistance capability requirements (section 
103) must "protect the privacy and security of communications not 
authorized to be intercepted" (sec 103 (a)(4)(A)). This provision requires 
telecommunications carriers, and telecommunications industry standards 
bodies, to consider privacy protection at the design stage and enshrine those 
protections into technical standards.  Before this legislation was enacted, 
telecommunications carriers were not required to consider privacy protection 
when designing their networks.</ul>
<p>
Because carriers and standards bodies are required to consider privacy 
protection during the standard setting process, and because standards set 
through this process can be challenged before the FCC for any reason, these 
provisions (if properly implemented) will enable the public to:
<p><ol>
<li>ensure that privacy is not compromised by technical standards developed 
to meet the requirements of the statute
<p>
<li>know what law enforcement's surveillance capability is, and
<p>
<li>have the opportunity to challenge law enforcement's capacity requests 
before they are implemented by telecommunications carriers.
</ol><p>
<b>Funding for Capability Requirements</b>
<p>
The government is required to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all 
costs associated with meeting the capability requirements for upgrades of 
equipment deployed before January 1, 1995, and for costs where modifications 
are not "reasonably achievable" (based on a determination by the FCC), for 
features and services deployed after January first 1995.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Features and services deployed before January 1, 1995 -- Government 
Reimbursement for all compliance costs: </b> The statute requires the 
government to reimburse carriers for reasonable costs directly associated with 
modifications necessary to meet the requirements (section 109 (a)). However, 
these modifications will not be made, and no funds will be spent, until the 
government consults with telecommunications carriers to facilitate the 
development of technical standards as specified under section 107.
<p>
<li><b>Features and services deployed after January 1, 1995 -- Government 
Reimbursement for modifications not 'Reasonably Achievable':</b>  The 
statute requires the government, subject to a request from a 
telecommunications carrier or other interested person, to reimburse a carrier 
for the costs of modifications which are not "reasonably achievable" (section 
109 (b)).  The FCC will determine whether compliance is reasonably 
achievable based on an analysis of whether compliance would impose a 
significant difficulty or expense on the carrier or the users of its network, and 
shall consider:<p>
<ul>
<li>the effect on public safety and national security
<li>the effect on rates for basic residential telephone service
<li>the need to protect the privacy and security of communications not 
<li>authorized to be intercepted
<li>the need to achieve the capability assistance requirements of section 103 
	by cost-effective methods 
</ul></ul>
and other factors. Interested parties, including privacy and consumer 
advocates, will have an opportunity to intervene in these proceedings. 
Furthermore, these proceedings will be public record, providing an important 
level of public accountability to law enforcement's surveillance requests. This 
will ensure that law enforcement is not making unreasonable demands for 
unnecessary capability, or force the public to incur the costs of compliance as a 
hidden surcharge on their monthly bill. Instead, the entire process, both the 
requests for capability and the cost of compliance will be available to the 
public with an opportunity to intervene.
<p>
<h3>B.	Capacity Requirements</h3>
<p>
The statute also requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that their 
system possesses sufficient capacity to accommodate a specified number of 
simultaneous intercepts, pen register, and trap and trace devices.  The statute 
requires the Attorney General to consult with telecommunications carriers, 
then publish specific capacity requirements in the federal register for notice 
and comment by the public. The Government is required to reimburse 
telecommunications carriers for all reasonable costs associated with capacity 
upgrades.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Determination of Capacity Needs:</b>  Before making any requests to 
telecommunications carriers under this provision, the government must 
determine what its capacity needs will be. This process, headed by the FBI's 
Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit (TILU), has begun soliciting 
information from telecommunications carriers as well as state and local law 
enforcement agencies. The statute requires that this process be completed, and 
notice provided to telecommunications carriers and to the public, on or 
before October 25, 1996 (sec 104 (a)(1)). 
<p>
<li><b>Consultation with State and local law enforcement agencies and 
telecommunications carriers and general public required:</b> Section 104 of 
the statute requires the Attorney General to consult with state and local law 
enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, manufacturers of 
telecommunications equipment in order to determine where capacity 
upgrades will be required and what those upgrades will be. After an 
opportunity for public comment (required in section 104 (a)(1)), the Attorney 
General must publish in the federal register and provide to 
telecommunications carriers:
<p><ol>
<li><b>Notice of Actual Capacity: </b>The actual number of intercepts, pen 
registers, and trap and trace devices that will be necessary 4 years from the 
date of enactment (sec 104 (a)(1)(A)); and
<p>
<li><b>Notice of Maximum Capacity: </b>The maximum capacity required 
to accommodate all intercepts, pen registers and trap and trace devices that 
the Attorney General estimates that government agencies will be authorized 
to conduct simultaneously after the date 4 years after enactment (sec 104 
(a)(1)(B)).</ol>
<p>
<li><b>Publication of Capacity Requirements: </b> Based on the results of the 
TILU survey, the Attorney general will then publish capacity notices as 
described above (and as required under section 104 of the statute).  
Telecommunications carriers will then have 3 years to comply with capacity 
notices, subject to government reimbursement (sec 104 (b) and (e)).
</ul>
<b>Public Accountability Provisions</b>
<p>
There are two separate opportunities for public oversight of the Capacity 
compliance process. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Notice and Comment Required: </b> Section 104 (a)(1) of the statute 
requires notice and comment before the Attorney general publishes the final 
capacity notices. Thus, the law request that the results of the TILU survey of 
telecommunications carrier capacity and the recommendations for capacity 
upgrades must be made available to the public for comment. If the FBI is 
believed to be making unreasonable demands for surveillance capacity based 
on the TILU recommendations the public will know and will have an 
opportunity to challenge the recommendations.
<p>
<li><b>Publication in Federal Register: </b> The notices of capacity needs, as 
required under section 104 (a), must be published in the Federal Register, 
providing the public with a second opportunity to ensure that law 
enforcement is not making unreasonable capacity demands.
</ul><p>
<b>Funding for Capacity Upgrades</b>                          
<p>
The entire process outlined above, including the public accountability 
opportunities, must occur before the government can spend any tax-payer 
funds to reimburse telecommunications carriers. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Government Reimbursement for Capacity Upgrades:</b>  Section 104 
(e) requires the government to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all 
<a name = "report">reasonable (*as defined in Section 109 (a), described below) costs associated </a>with capacity upgrades required by the statute.   If the government fails to reimburse a carrier, that carrier will not have to modify any feature or serv


ice.  This provision is intended to ensure that the government prioritizes capacity  requests and does not demand unnecessary surveillance capability financed by hidden charges to subscribers.
</ul><p>
<h3>V.	Reporting Requirements</h3>
<p>
Finally, section 112 of the statute requires the government to issue several 
reports on the costs of meeting the capability and capacity requirements of the 
statute.  These reports will provide the public with a detailed accounting of 
law enforcement surveillance expenditures, as well as an accounting of law 
enforcement surveillance capability and capacity, including capability and 
capacity for which law enforcement did not reimburse telecommunications 
carriers. 
<p>
Starting on November 30, 1995 and for every year after, the Attorney General 
will report:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Government Costs:</b> a detailed accounting of the amounts paid to 
each carrier and the equipment, facility, or service for which the amounts 
were paid;
<p>
<li><b>Future Cost:</b> projections of the amounts expected to be paid in 
the current fiscal year, the carriers to which payment is expected to be made, 
and the equipment, facilities, or services for which payment is expected to be 
made.
<p></ul>
In addition to reports by the Attorney General, the Comptroller General, after 
consulting with the Attorney General and the telecommunications industry, 
will issue a report every 2 years describing:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Extent of Network Design Changes Made as a Result of CALEA:</b> 
the type of equipment, facilities, and services that have been brought into 
compliance under the statute;
<p>
<li><b>Cost-Effectiveness of Government Reimbursement: </b>an analysis of the 
reasonableness and cost-effectiveness of the payments made by the 
Attorney General to telecommunications carriers for modifications necessary 
to ensure compliance under the statute.</ul>
<p>
<a name = "privacy">This report will also include a description of the costs to be incurred by</A>  telecommunications carriers to comply with the capability requirements after the effective date, including projections of the cost and a description of the


 equipment and services for which cots will be incurred.
<p>
<h3>VI.	New Privacy Protections</h3> 
<p>
The statute adds several new statutory privacy protections. In addition to 
monitoring the implementation of the capability and capacity requirements 
and cost reimbursement provisions, these new privacy protections must be 
vigorously enforced.
<ul>
<li><b>Increased Protection for Online Transactional Information:</b>  
Section 207 (a) amended 18 USC 2703 to increase the standard for law 
enforcement access to transactional data generated by electronic 
communications services from a mere subpoena to a court order based on 
"specific and articulable facts" that such records are "relevant and material to 
an ongoing criminal investigation" (sec 207 (a)(2)).
</ul><p>
By enacting this provision, Congress recognized that transactional 
information generated by electronic communications networks such as the 
Internet, electronic bulletin boards and commercial online services (such as 
America Online and Compuserve) reveal a great deal more about the content 
of a specific communication than do telephone toll records.  Because online 
transactional records are personally identifiable, this provision raised the 
standard for law enforcement access to require the affirmative intervention of 
a Judge, a standard similar to (although not as strong as) that required for law 
enforcement access to the content of a communication.
<ul><p>
<li><b>Limitation on Pen Register Authority to Preclude Location and other 
Transactional Information:</b> Section 207 (b) amended 18 USC 2516 to limit 
the design of pen register devices (devices which identifies numbers dialed) to 
prevent the use of pen registers to track individuals throughout the network 
or to reveal information beyond numbers dialed.  
</ul><P>
This section prohibits the authority for pen register devices to be used to 
obtain tracking or location information, other than that which can be 
determined from the telephone number.  This provision is particularly 
important in wireless networks, where transactional data that can be obtained 
through a pen register device can reveal location information. The section 
further creates a "technical minimization requirement", requiring law 
enforcement to use reasonably available technology to minimize the ability of 
pen register devices to generate any information beyond numbers dialed.
 <ul><p>
<li><b>Expanded Protection for Cordless Telephones:</b>  Section 202 
extends the privacy protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 
(ECPA) to cover cordless telephones.  Specifically, sec. 202 brings the radio 
portion of a cordless telephone communication (the transmission between 
the handset and the base unit) under section 2510 of ECPA.
<p>
<li><b>No Prohibition on the Use of Encryption:</b>  Section 103 (b)(3) 
explicitly affirms the right of subscribers to use encryption, and places no 
<a name = "concl">obligation on a telecommunications carrier to have the ability (or to ensure </a> the government's ability) to decrypt a communication, unless the encryption product is provided by the carrier or the carrier has the information necessary


 to decrypt it. 
</ul><p>
<h3>VII.	Conclusion</h3>
<p>
If properly adhered to, these statutory privacy protections, combined with the 
public accountability provisions outlined earlier provide the public with a 
significant degree of oversight over law enforcement surveillance capabilities.
<p>
However, in order to ensure that the privacy protections are properly 
implemented and adhered to, the compliance process must be closely 
monitored and, when necessary, the provisions allowing intervention and 
public oversight must be utilized.
