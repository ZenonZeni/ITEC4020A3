<P>
Although the education sectors share of the national economy has tended to level
 out after increasing in the 1960s and 1970s, the demand for higher education 
services has continued to increase because of rising participation rates. Around 30% of students now undertake post-school studies compared with 10% a decade 
ago.  <P>
Education exports have grown strongly over the past decade and are worth around
$1.7 billion, including $100 million earned from the overseas provision of 
Australian education services.
<P>
It has also been estimated that, with a concerted effort, Australia's share of 
the market could rise to $5 to $10 billion over the next five years. The number of full-fee paying students in Australia increased from about 2,000 in 1986 to 
23,000 in 1989, and to 63,000 by 1993.
<P>
Overseas projects in education services involve the delivery of projects 
offshore using Australian management and teaching/training experts. These 
projects typically take place in Asia-Pacific countries and are paid for by 
loans to the nation concerned from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
The education services sector employs around 7% of the total workforce in 
Victoria.
<P>
Victoria has a relatively high participation rate in upper secondary education 
compared with the other states, whilst the number of higher education students 
is at a record high.
<P>
In 1993, there were 19,000 fee-paying students from overseas undertaking courses in Victoria, some 30% of the national total. Most were from Asia, particularly
Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Peoples Republic of China and Singapore.
<P>
Exports of educational services from Victoria are around $500 million, equal to
50% of spending by foreign tourists. While the full-fee paying overseas students
 market is the major export earner, overseas projects involving the packaging of
 education and training services for delivery in other countries earns around 
$20 million a year.
<P>
Several Victorian educational institutions are involved in joint ventures with 
educational institutions overseas to conduct courses for students in their own 
countries. Increasing numbers of institutions and companies are also involved in joint arrangements to provide technical, trade and other workforce-related 
educational services offshore.
<P>
Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria (OPCV) manages a number of aid-funded
overseas projects relating to training services and education systems through 
strategic alliances with education and training organisations.
<P>
In response to the demand from developing countries for access to quality 
tertiary education and the need to keep costs down, television-based distance 
learning has recently been marketed overseas by Open Learning Agency, a Monash 
University-led consortium.
  <P>

<B><I>Prospects</B></I>
<P>

Australia has around 1% of the world market for overseas students which is 
estimated at US$100 billion a year. Scope for export expansion lies mainly in 
the Asia Pacific region.
<P>
Innovative programs in telecommunications and distance learning are being 
developed and delivered by some Australian organisations. Opportunities also 
exist in providing equipment and software relating to publishing and information technology.
  <P>
The education and training needs of Asian countries vary enormously and are 
impacted upon by the various cultural, economic, political and social conditions of each country.
<P>
Those markets which have up to now delivered large numbers of students to 
Australia are increasingly demonstrating their desire to develop their own 
educational infrastructure. In this context, joint ventures with Asian educators will become increasingly important.
