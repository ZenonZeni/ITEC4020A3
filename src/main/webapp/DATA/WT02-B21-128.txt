&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many expedition travelers to Indonesia feel they must journey as far off the beaten path as possible, away from centers of "mass tourism" to places such as the Asmat or Muluku Sea regions.  Sometimes, in the rush to the more remote parts of Indonesia, Bali becomes a mere transit point.  Tourists who only visit the posh resorts or loud beach towns remark on how Bali is "spoiled" and overrun with discos, vendors, and hotels.  Unfortunately, most travelers never see the "other Bali," the Bali I call home.  This Bali is one of daily offerings, rituals and ceremonies, of smiles that touch the heart, of stunning man made and natural landscapes, of people who remind one how to be gentle again.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I first visited Ubud 10 years ago when there was only one telephone, hardly any electricity or cars.  I  came for two weeks and stayed two months.  During this time, I became very close to a cheerful lady named Wayan - first born in Balinese.  Wayan operated a small "warung" or food stall on the dirt path that is now Monkey Forest Road.  She sold coffee to rice farmers and made black rice pudding for the small number of tourists who visited.  Her husband Ketut - fourth born in Balinese, operated a small art studio.  Wayan and Ketut looked after me so well, I returned to live with their family and never left.  Wayan’s food stall has become Cafe Wayan, receiving write-ups in Bon Appetite Magazine.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few years ago, on secluded family land overlooking rice fields and a river valley, Ketut created a guesthouse called Alam Indah, meaning beautiful nature.  I now run Alam Indah, and operate cultural tours throughout Indonesia.  I feel blessed to have my own perfect niche in Bali, where, with the help of my Balinese family and friends, I share with special individuals a side of Bali most visitors never see.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Through running several small cultural programs in Bali, I came to know Jean and William Ingram.  The Ingrams have lived in Bali for over 10 years and have a wonderfully close relationship with the Balinese family whose home they share.  They too, have a deep love for Bali and feel feel that environmentally and culturally sensitive tourism can reinforce pride in the traditional way of life while sharing its wisdom with the rest of  the world.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="bali.gif" ALT="bali.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=250 BORDER=2>I have long been associated with Zegrahm Expeditions Indonesia voyages, and have traveled with many of their clients.  Therefore, I was delighted when I was asked to design an itinerary which would show off "my" Bali.  Our adventure will be centered in Ubud, the arts and cultural center of the island.  Here, at our home Alam Indah,  we slip into another mode of life, more in tune with geckos and the sounds of frogs than the hectic life of a crowded beach.  We will have the exclusive use of Alam Indah - 10 comfortable, Balinese style rooms set amidst lush gardens, with a beautiful swimming pool overlooking the river valley and the sacred land of the Monkey Forest Temple.  We start the day with yoga, slowing down our western pace of life as we learn varied aspects of Balinese culture.  Our experience will be one of peaceful learning, as we meet gamelan players, master wood carvers and herbalists.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our visit will coincide with the Galungan festival, the most important festival of the year.  During Galungan all of Bali makes beautiful bamboo poles called penjor which are placed in front of family compounds for the Gods of Mount Agung to see.  We observe and take part in learning the cycle of worshipping the Gods and ancestors through our Bali guides and their Balinese families.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This Zegrahm program differs somewhat from their Indonesia voyages.  I think I would call it more of a cultural immersion than an expedition, for through the insights of Jean and William and their family, we have a unique opportunity to experience daily life in Bali with a small personalized group.  We will come to understand more of how the Balinese look at life and, through this, we will come to understand why they are able to maintain their culture in the mist of such change.  Balinese Hinduism recognizes the forces of positive and negative as equal.  The Balinese are devoted to maintaining a harmony between the two.  This is the reason Balinese culture remains strong through all development and change.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I hope I may be your host in Indonesia.  As William says, "Now that I know what is possible in life, I cannot settle for anything else...."..Come and see some of the last treasures on earth.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>Our trip Beyond Bali departs 12 September 1997.  It will include eight days in Ubud, three days in Munduk and four days in Sulawesi’s Toraja Land.  We will also offer an optional extension to Borneo to photograph the orangutan.  Call Kristy to receive a "hot off the press" brochure.</I><BR>
