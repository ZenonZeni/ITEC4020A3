<b>MARK WRIGHTON </b>

<P>

Mark Wrighton, a former member of the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel, 
is 

currently serving as chancellor and professor of chemistry at Washington 
University in 

St. Louis. He began his career at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology in 1972 as 

an assistant professor of chemistry, and became head of the chemistry 
department in 

1987. He became provost of M.I.T. in 1990, a post he held until the 
summer of 1995, 

when he moved over to Washington University. While at M.I.T., he led 
initiatives to 

develop new environmental education and research programs.  

<P>  

Wrighton has received extensive academic and public recognition for his 


research activities, which have focused on elucidating the basic 
principles underlying 

the conversion of solar energy to chemical fuels and electricity, 
discerning new 

catalysts and ways of making them, understanding the chemistry at 
interfaces, and 

developing new electrochemical devices. More recently, Wrighton was 
featured in a 

1989 Business Week special issue on "Innovation in America," which 
profiled his work 

on molecular electronics and listed him as one of the top ten innovators 
in science. He 

was included in Esquire's 1989 Register along with 38 other men and 
women "who are 

making America a smarter, healthier, wealthier, safer, livelier, 
prettier, all-around more 

interesting place to live." 

<P>

Wrighton has served on the editorial advisory boards of several 
prominent 

chemical journals, including Chemical and Engineering News and the 
Journal of 

Physical Chemistry. He currently serves as a member of the scientific 
advisory boards 

of Igen, Pharmacopeia, and Optex. He received his B.S. in chemistry from 
Florida State 

University and his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology.
