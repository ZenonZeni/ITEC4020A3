Are electric cars becoming a reality?  Has anyone built a "hybrid" vehicle yet?  Who’s tackling the technical problems of making cleaner cars?
The answers are yes -- we are.  We are America’s advanced transportation consortia., dedicated to creating good jobs in a new global industry.<p>  
Spread across the breadth of the nation, we represent six regional hubs of technical innovation in advanced transportation (see participant map, pages 14-15).  Focused public investment has meant significant innovation.  Linked in a cooperative information-sharing web, our networks of leading-edge firms and organizations -- many formerly involved in defense efforts — are rapidly tapping America’s talent to create the world's next generation of cars, trucks and buses. <p>
 
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>A Bias for Action</FONT></h3><p>
Each of the six consortia are unique.  But by working together through the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), we are taking the knowledge of a nation and focusing it on electric and hybrid electric vehicle development.  Our charter is not talk and study — we believe in acting and building.   In this year alone we will have placed more advanced vehicles on the road than anyone else in America— including automakers.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Dual-Use</FONT></h3><p>
A key focus of the consortia effort has been to further the development of dual-use technology — components and systems that serve not only commercial vehicle markets but also meet emerging requirements for our nation’s defense.  The value of this approach is underscored by the fact that much of each region’s technology and job growth can be traced back to specific military or space-based initiatives.  Closing the loop with a diverse portfolio of commercial and defense transportation technologies serves not only national priorities, but will strengthen local economies for years to come. <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>A Model for Success</FONT></h3><p>
Teamwork, motivation and true public/private cooperation are making it happen.  At the direction of Congress, ARPA in 1993 created an electric and hybrid electric vehicle development program.  ARPA took a modest $25 million federal investment and more than doubled it by partnering with industry.  But you can’t buy innovation.  It has to be encouraged.  ARPA realized not all the answers are at the top.  It sought the best talent and approaches from diverse teams of more than 130 private companies working together.  And then set them to work.  <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Tomorrow is Here Today</FONT></h3><p>
We are making the so-called impossible happen today.  <p><ul>
<li> Have you heard of flywheel mechanical batteries?  They’re real.  We’re testing them now.  
<li> Can a car be built entirely of lightweight composite materials?  Ask us.  We’re doing it.  
<li> Can an electric car be manufactured affordably?  Look at our design.  It’s on the road today.  
<li> Does fast recharging work?  Look up the 24-hour distance record for EVs.  We set it.  
<li> We go from paper to prototype in months, not years.    <p></ul>          
Like a fresh wind blowing across America, there is new spirit of innovation moving across the land.  It is based on cooperation tempered with competition, a can-do approach that encourages the best teams to tackle tough problems on tight deadlines.  And deliver.  It can happen.  Let us show you how.<p>
So please read on and meet America’s innovators.  Because in transportation, America can’t afford to stall.<p>








<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>New ARPA Consortium Formed for Mid-Atlantic States</FONT></h3>

America's newest advanced transportation consortium, the Mid Atlantic Regional Consortium for Advanced Vehicles (MARCAV), has just received ARPA funding to demonstrate and deploy several innovative transportation technology projects. This new consortium focuses the talents of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, where it is based.
Some of the first technologies under development include a high efficiency DC motor and controller, composite utility EV and polymer batteries.<p><ul>
