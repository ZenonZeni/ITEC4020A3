<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>AMI Settles Fair-Housing Suit</H2>
<H4>by David Rose, AMI of DuPage County, Illinois</H4>
</font>
<hr>
	As reported in the May/June 1996 Advocate, AMI of DuPage County, 
Illinois, won a fair-housing suit against the city of Naperville, 
Illinois, in the U.S. District Court.  The city's initial response 
to the court's order to reach a settlement was to file an appeal in 
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  But after several months of 
intensive negotiations, a settlement was reached in which the 
Naperville city council agreed:
<P><ul>
	<LI> to withdraw its appeal;
	<LI> to apply to our group home the city's 1990 zoning code, under 
which such facilities are deemed "permitted uses" in all 
residential zoning districts;
	<LI> to pay AMI of DuPage $90,000 in penalties and damages;
	<LI> to appoint by name and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
and fair-housing enforcement officer who will be responsible for 
training and educating staff and community organizations and 
investigating alleged violations of the ADA and the Fair Housing 
Act within the city; and, finally,
	<LI> to send a formal letter of welcome, in the name of the city of 
Naperville, to the residents of the group home.
</ul>
<P>
	In a joint news release, both parties expressed their satisfaction 
with reaching an amicable resolution of a two-year-long dispute.  
As is typical in such settlements, the city did not admit that its 
actions had violated any law.  Nevertheless, the Naperville city 
manager stated, "As far as we are concerned, the matter has been 
resolved, and we are pleased that a mutually acceptable solution 
has been achieved."  As advocates, we are especially gratified to 
have the legitimacy of our group home acknowledged.
<P>
	Although our suit in Federal District Court was focused narrowly 
on the heightened life-safety code the defendants were attempting 
to impose on our group home, our suit has much broader 
implications.  Our civil rights attorney, Jeffrey L Taren, stated, 
"This controversy never should have happened, and we are pleased 
that the city sat down with AMI to resolve it.  The settlement is 
an important step toward removing barriers to fair housing 
everywhere.
<P>
	The money received by AMI, after payment of legal fees, will be 
dedicated to promoting services for and to improving the lives of 
people with brain disorders throughout DuPage County.
