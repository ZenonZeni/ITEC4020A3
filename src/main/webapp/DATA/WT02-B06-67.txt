<H3>From MSN's Member Guidelines:<BR>
<BR>
E-mail</H3>
Electronic mail (or e-mail) permits direct communication between MSN members
and: 
<UL>
<LI>MSN merchants and advertisers. 
<LI>Members of other online services over the Internet. 
<LI>People connected to the Internet. 
</UL>
E-mail is sent to the addressee and does not appear publicly. MSN will make
every effort to keep members' e-mail private while it is under MSN control;
sending e-mail over the Internet involves networks that are not part of
MSN and might not be as secure.<BR>
<BR>
MSN will not intercept, attempt to intercept, open or attempt to open e-mail
without authorization from the sender or recipient. On rare occasions, MSN
might be required by legal process to disclose the contents of e-mail in
connection with an investigation of alleged illegal activity. <BR>
<BR>
New, unread e-mail is retained online for 45 days. Usually when you read
your MSN e-mail, it is moved from The Microsoft Network to your computer,
where it remains as long as you retain it. However, you can choose instead
to preview your e-mail. In this case, you transfer a copy of your e-mail
to your computer and leave the original on MSN, where it remains for 15
days. The length of time e-mail remains on MSN is subject to change as network
conditions require.<BR>
<BR>
For a detailed description of e-mail reading options, look up E-mail messages
in the MSN Help Index.<BR>
