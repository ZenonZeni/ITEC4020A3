 Established in 1981, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) is
the national trade association for the domestic ethanol industry.
 The RFA has promoted the use of renewable energy resources by
serving as a vital link between domestic ethanol producers and
the U.S. Congress and Federal and State Government and regulatory
agencies, American industries and consumers nationwide.  RFA is
dedicated toward the establishment of a strong marketplace for
renewable fuels, increased consumer awareness and acceptance of
alternative fuel sources, communication of sound technical industry
data, and substantial industry growth for ethanol, ETBE and other
renewable fuels in the U.S. fuel marketplace.  With a proven track
record as a leader in the renewable fuels industry, the RFA is
recognized nationwide as an organization dedicated to the continued
vitality and growth of alternative fuels.
<P>
 The RFA promotes a visible and competitive domestic renewable
fuels industry by aggressively pursuing the following objectives:
<P>
<ul>
<li>To promote federal, state and local government policies, programs
and initiatives advantageous to the development and use of ethanol
fuels to the U.S. Congress and other federal, state and local
government entities.
<P>
<li>To provide the utmost and technically accurate and up-to-date
information  on ethanol blended fuels to consumers, environmentalists,
gasoline marketers, auto manufacturers and technicians.
<P>
<li>To distribute accurate information and to correct misinformation
about ethanol fuels to the media.
<P>
<li>To participate in educational activities to increase public awareness
concerning the production, distribution and use of renewable fuels
and the contribution that they can make to American energy independence
and the enhancement of national security.
<P>
<li>To keep RFA members abreast of new technological developments
on renewable fuels at universities, private research institutions
and other associations.

<h2><img src="blueball.gif"> Renewable Fuels Membership</h2>
<P>
 The <a href="rfa9.html">Renewable Fuels Association Membership</a>, which includes 90%
of all U.S. ethanol production, encompasses a broad cross-section
of private industries, businesses and organizations involved in
the production, blending and marketing of alternative and renewable
fuels.  This group of ethanol producers and potential producers,
fuel retailers, ethanol fuel blenders, equipment manufacturers,
farm organizations, energy and engineering companies, and consumer
organizations are dedicated to the expansion and continued development
of the U.S. fuel ethanol industry.

 The Renewable Fuels Association's organization includes key committees
established to provide leadership and expertise for the domestic
ethanol industry.  Those include:
<P>
<I><h3>Technical Committee</h3></I> - The RFA's Technical Committee
works with ethanol producers and blenders on issues relation to
the production, blending, distribution, and performance of ethanol
and ETBE blends.  The Committee has published, &quot;Gasoline
Ethanol Blends Program Operations Guide,&quot; which sets forth
industry standards and practices.  By defining the dominant issues
of interest facing the private sector in the production, distribution
and use of renewable fuels, the Technical Committee provides accurate
technical information to both the public and private sector, spurring
significant advances in the use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol,
ETBE and biodiesel.
<P>
<I><h3>Market Development Committee</h3></I> - The Market Development
Committee seeks to establish and augment creative economic and
marketplace conditions favorable to the domestic ethanol industry.
 By increasing public awareness about the value of renewable fuels,
the committee provides consumers with insight to and assurances
of a high quality product for use in the U.S. fuel marketplace.
<P>
Among the committee's publications is an advanced motor fuels
technical manual and video training tape for auto mechanics and
car care specialists, &quot;Changes in Gasoline - the Auto Technicians
Gasoline Quality Guide.&quot;  With a circulation of over 400,000,
this manual is also used by over 300 colleges and technical schools
as well as commercial training centers and several auto manufacturers.
<P>
<I><h3>Membership Committee</h3></I> - The Membership Committee
is instrumental in increasing awareness about the tremendous benefits
of membership in the Renewable Fuels Association.  The Committee
engages in an extensive outreach program to continually expand
the renewable fuels community to include new producers of ethanol,
marketers, blenders, equipment manufacturers, technology design
engineers and suppliers, consumer and environmental organizations,
and agricultural commodity organizations that support the use
of renewable energy.  The Committee establishes fees and responsibilities
for membership in the Renewable Fuels Association.
<P>
<I><h3>Small Producers Committee</h3></I> - The Small Producers
Committee focuses on unique situations involving smaller ethanol
producers.  The Committee focuses on research and development
projects regarding production and distribution services and supply
situations.
