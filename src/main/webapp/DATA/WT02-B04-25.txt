<STRONG><CENTER>ORDER</CENTER></STRONG>
AND NOW, this 15th day of May, 1996, upon consideration of 
plaintiffs' Motion to Clarify and Restate the Court's Orders 
Concerning Defendants' Actions Pending Resolution of Plaintiffs' 
Motions for Preliminary Relief, and the response of the Government 
thereto, and the Court finding that:

(a) On February 15, 1996 this Court entered a Temporary Restraining 
Order enjoining &quot;[t]he defendant, her agents, and her servants . . .
from enforcing against plaintiffs the provisions of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 
223(a) (1) (B) (ii), insofar as they extend to 'indecent,' but not 
'obscene'&quot; Internet content, see docket no. 14; 

(b) Thereafter, the parties entered a stipulation in which the 
Attorney General promised that &quot;she will not initiate any 
investigations or prosecutions for violations of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)
for conduct occurring after enactment of this provision until 
the three-judge court hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction... and has decided the motion&quot; see docket no. 18;<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  

(c) This Court approved the Stipulation on February 26, 1996, 
giving it the force of an Order of this Court; 

(d) In March and April of 1996, Patrick A. Trueman, the Director of 
Governmental Affairs of the American Family Association, sent 
letters to the Attorney General, claiming that CompuServe, a 
plaintiff in civil action no. 96-1458, &quot;is a content provider 
rather than merely an access provider of pornography, possibly 
obscene material&quot; see pls.' mot. ex. 3 (Letters of March 4, April 
1, April 10, and April 29, 1996 from Patrick A. Trueman to Attorney 
General Janet Reno); 

(e) Attached to Mr. Trueman's March 4th letter was a Wall Street 
Journal Article, and eight photographs of nude women in poses 
analogous to Playboy or Penthouse centerfolds allegedly available 
through a CompuServe database, id.;

(f) The sexual organs of the photos had been &quot;blank[ed] out&quot;, but a 
statement advised, &quot;[y]ou can get the unretouched versions by 
visiting&quot; the CompuServe database, id.;

(g) In response to Mr. Trueman, Terry R. Lord, Acting Director of 
the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Criminal 
Division of the Department of Justice, explained that Mr. Trueman's 
information &quot;concerning potential violations of the Communications 
Decency Act (CDA) by CompuServe&quot; was &quot;helpful&quot; in determin[ing] the 
best methods of identifying, investigating, and prosecuting 
violators with the goal of deterring similar conduct&quot;, id. ex. 3 
(April 29, 1996 from Terry R. Lord to Patrick A. Trueman); 

(h) The Department of Justice then referred the matter to the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, which begin a &quot;review&quot; of 
CompuServe, id.;

(i) The Columbus [Ohio] Dispatch reported the &quot;review&quot; in at least 
two prominent news stories, and similar information was available 
through a newswire, see id. exs. 1-2; 

(j) The plaintiffs in C.A. No. 96-1458 have now moved this court 
for an Order to clarify the February 15th Temporary Restraining 
Order and the February 26th Stipulation and Order to prevent the 
Department of Justice from &quot;reviewing&quot; Internet Content that falls 
within the scope of the prohibitions in those two Orders; 

(k) In its written response to the motion, the Government has 
emphasized that the Attorney General retains her full discretion to 
prosecute the CDA as it relates to obscenity and child pornography, 
see defs.' resp. at 5-6;

(l) The Government echoed these arguments at oral argument on May 
10, 1996, see Transcript of May 10, 1996 at 150, 154-55; 

(m) Although the Government is correct about the Attorney General's 
continued discretion under the obscenity and child pornography 
provisions of the CDA, this point misses the mark entirely, for the 
following reasons: 

i. Under the Government's view of this case, nude depictions of 
sexual organs alone are almost certainly not obscene, see, e.g.,  
Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 92 (&quot;[O]ur position would be that 
the [CDA's indecency provisions] should apply to non-obscene 
patently offensive sexual and excretory material . . ., namely the 
sexually explicit sites on the Internet&quot;.), 99 (&quot;It is conceivable 
that [a] Mapplethorpe picture . . . might in some communities. . . 
be a problem [under the CDA's indecency provisions] because it is 
certainly a depiction of a sexual organ, we can agree to that.&quot;), 
106 (rejecting the argument that &quot;because . . . material appeals to 
the prurient interest and arguably has no serious value, it is 
necessarily obscene. That is a legal determination and I think that 
that analysis is simply wrong.&quot;), 107 (&quot;I can accept the colloquial 
characterization of pornography [a]s appealing to the prurient 
interest and lacking serious value, but I do not accept the 
conclusion that that is necessarily obscene.&quot;), 107-08 (noting 
that, although &quot;a  Playboy centerfold appeals to the prurient 
interest . . . [,] I doubt it's obscene.&quot;), 117-17 (same) ;<A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 

ii. The women in the photographs are almost certainly not minors; 

iii. At most, then, the Government has initiated a &quot;review&quot; of 
CompuServe purportedly for obscenity and child pornography based 
only on the availability of indecent material there; 

(n) Thus, neither actual obscenity nor child pornography provided 
the impetus for the Department of Justice's referral of CompuServe 
for &quot;review&quot; by the FBI;<A HREF="#note_3"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>

(o) Notwithstanding the Government's post hoc rationalization for 
the actions of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Division,<A HREF="#note_4"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> 
its conduct in subjecting a content provider to private and public 
scrutiny for displaying material that is neither obscene nor child 
pornography clearly runs afoul of both this Court's Orders and the 
Government's promises, as made in the Stipulation we approved on 
February 26, 1996;
 
It is hereby ORDERED that: 

1. Plaintiffs' Motion to Clarify and Restate the Court's Orders 
Concerning Defendants' Actions Pending Resolution of Plaintiffs' 
Motions for Preliminary Relief is GRANTED; 

2. &quot;Review&quot; by the Attorney General or her agents, including the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, of sexually oriented Internet 
content falls within this Court's Temporary Restraining Order of 
February 15, 1996 and the Stipulation this Court approved by Order 
on February 26, 1996, when that &quot;review&quot; is triggered by (1) 
content that is neither obscene nor child pornography, or (2) 
complaints of Internet content that, as described, constitute 
neither obscenity nor child pornography; 

3. The Attorney General and her agents are ENJOINED from engaging 
in &quot;review&quot; of a content provider if that &quot;review&quot; is triggered by 
either of the two circumstances described in paragraph two of this 
Order; and

4. The Attorney General and her agents retain their full power to 
&quot;review&quot; complaints regarding Internet content that constitutes 
obscenity or child pornography, provided that, if, upon &quot;review&quot; it 
appears that the material complained of is neither obscene or child 
pornography, the &quot;review&quot; must than immediately cease. <A

<STRONG>FOOTNOTES</STRONG>
<A NAME="note_1"></A>
<SUP>(1)</SUP> For the purposes of this motion only, we refer to 
the &quot;indecency&quot; provision of &#167; 223(a) and the &quot;patently offensive&quot; 
provision of &#167; 223(d) as the &quot;indecency provisions&quot;. 
<A NAME="note_2"></A>

<SUP>(2)</SUP> Some of these quotations arose in discussions of the 
content of the &quot;Schmidt notebook.&quot; The Schmidt notebook is a set of 
exhibits to the declaration of Howard A. Schmidt, a Government 
expert. The notebook contained downloaded sexual images that range 
from modestly titillating centerfold-type photographs to depictions 
of hard-core sex acts. The Government's comments at oral argument 
made clear that it views the Schmidt notebook as containing, for 
the most part, indecent material. See e.g., Transcript of May 10, 
1996, at 106 (arguing that Congress &quot;needs to sweep into . . . the 
indecency standard this type of stuff, the kind of stuff in the 
Schmidt notebook&quot;). Indeed, in the Government's view, &quot;that's the 
point&quot;: 
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>JUDGE SLOVITER: You'll agree that all of those materials 
in the Schmidt notebook. . .   were designed to appeal 
to the prurient interests of the viewer? 

Mr. COPPOLINO: Yes , I would say that they would but . . . 
that doesn't mean they're obscene , your honor[,] and 
that's the point </PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
Id. at 116-17. the images that led to CompuServe's &quot;review&quot; are no 
more graphic than the less graphic images in the Schmidt notebook. 
<A NAME="note_3"></A>

<SUP>(3)</SUP> The pictures at issue are somewhat murky in the copies 
supplied us, but they clearly do not involve sex acts. They appear to be 
centerfold-type images of women above the age of majority. In any 
event, the Government's response to plaintiffs' motion does not suggest
that the photographs themselves constitute obscenity or child 
pornography. The Government has also offered no facts to suggest that
either Mr. Trueman or another citizen provided other content from 
CompuServe's database that is obscene or child pornography. To the 
contrary, it would appear that these documents were the entire impetus
for the referral to the FBI. See  pls.' mot. ex. 3 (undated letter from 
Terry R. Lord to Bruce J. Ennis).
<A NAME="note_4"></A>

<SUP>(4)</SUP> A hypothetical further demonstrates the unpersuasiveness
of this explanation. Assume, for example, that a mother complained that
a subscriber to an access provider had said some, or most, of the Carlin 
seven dirty words to her child in a chat room devoted to political 
discussions. Under the Government's view of the Attorney General's 
retained discretion under the CDA, Mr. Lord could then, without offending
this Court's Order, refer that access provider to the FBI for &quot;review&quot; for 
violations of obscenity and child pornography statutes.
<A NAME="note_5"></A>

<SUP>(5)</SUP> We trust that the distinctions that we draw in these 
paragraphs &quot;described with sufficient particularity what [the 
Government] must do in order to satisfy&quot; them. <EM>Kolendar v. 
Lawson</EM>, 461 U.S. 352, 361 (1983).
