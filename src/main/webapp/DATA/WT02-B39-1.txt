DEUTSCHE POST'S TAKEOVER PLAN STYMIED BY SCHRODERS

DEUTSCHE POST's ambition to take over 75 percent of Postbank, the state-
owned German bank - in alliance with Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re - has
suffered a blow with the release of a report by UK investment bank
Schroders for the German government.

Schroders has recommended that Deutsche Post, the German post office,
should get a stake of no more than 25 percent plus one share in the
bank.

Last October, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re made a surprise
DM3.1 billion ($2.1 billion) bid for 75 percent of Postbank, widely
considered a gross undervaluation. Deutsche Post wanted to keep 40
percent of the capital and divide the rest between the other two
bidders (see EB 118). Schroders has put Postbank's current market value
at between DM4 billion and DM5.1 billion.

Wolfgang Botsch, Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who
supported this hostile bid, seems to like Schroders's idea so far, but
has not made a definitive statement. Postbank is adamant that the stake
should be between 15 percent and 20 percent. It would not accept a 25
percent stake unless"certain conditions (not defined) were met", a
spokesman said.

Schroders has recommended that Postbank get rid of its 80 specialised
outlets in post offices, carry out marketing jointly with Deutsche Post
and sell its products over the post office counters. This would open
the way for recruiting other financial services partners, Schroders
said.

No doubt Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re would want a piece of this action,
along with the partners that Postbank sought out for a counter attack -
BHF Bank and Volksfursorge, the insurance group.

SE-BANKEN FINED FOR GIVING MISLEADING INFORMATION

SKANDINAVISKA ENSKILDA Banken, Sweden's largest bank, has been hit with
a fine of SKr2.14 million ($3.3 million) by the Stockholm Stock
Exchange for providing misinformation on the heavy credit losses which
caused a dramatic fall in its profits in 1995.

The stock exchange accuses the bank of providing misleading information
on Luxonen, a failed financial investment group, in a press release of
January 23 last year. SE-Banken stated that the Luxonen losses were
covered by SKr1 billion provisions made in 1994 and that restructuring
the group would strengthen rather than weaken its position.

In the first six months of 1995, however, SE-Banken made further
provisions of SKr2.9 billion to cover Luxonen losses. First half
profits dropped from SKr2.2 billion to a mere Skr19 million (see EB
117).

The stock exchange disciplinary committee has imposed a SKr2.14 fine,
corresponding to two annual listing fees.

SE Banken admits that it was not fully aware at the time of
the"complicated construction" of the swap contracts held by Luxonen,
which caused much of the loss, a spokeswoman said.

FRANCE READY FOR CONSOLIDATION?

Some recent deals seem to indicate that the French banking industry is
willing to consider the type of consolidation that has become common in
Europe in recent years

FOUR EVENTS toward the end of 1995 suggest that, faced with an
unprecedented crisis, the French banking industry has embarked on a
long overdue period of consolidation and rationalisation.

In December, after many hiccups, Credit National finally announced the
terms of its public offer to acquire Banque Francaise de Commerce
Exterieur (BFCE) and its intention that the two banks' operations
should eventually merge.

Each of the banks is already among the top 15 banks in France by assets
and combined they will have total assets of Fr350 billion ($71 billion)
and a corporate loan book of Fr195 billion. This will give Credit
National "the means to assert itself as one of the top French
institutions", according to the bank's chairman Emmanuel Rodocanachi.

In itself, the deal is likely to have only a limited impact on the
banking industry. Credit National and BFCE have small branch networks
and are involved in sectors where commercial banks barely tread. Credit
National, for example, focuses largely on long-term corporate loans to
large and medium-sized companies, capital markets and equity financing
business. BFCE's activities are concentrated on the corporate sector;
international trade financing and cash management services.

The true significance of the deal lies in its symbolic value. The
proposed merger is, in fact, the first such operation of consequence in
France since the merger of Banque Indochine and Banque de Suez et de
l'Union des Mines to form Banque Indosuez in 1975. It is testimony of
the French banking industry's willingness to contemplate the type of
consolidation that has become common in Europe in recent years.

The second significant event pointing toward long-overdue consolidation
was the news that GAN, a major insurance company, is to sell a majority
stake in its banking subsidiary Groupe CIC as part of its
privatisation. Groupe CIC is the seventh-largest bank in France so
there are likely to be suitors aplenty although, like many French
banks, CIC is barely profitable. It has an abysmal cost-to-income ratio
of 80 percent.

Societe Generale and Credit Mutuel have already expressed an interest,
although banks from outside France (possibly the Dutch bank ABN AMRO)
may also be tempted to add CIC's network of around 1,300 branches to
their empires.

The ardour of some suitors may, however, be tempered if it is decided
to sell the different regional CIC networks separately. The acquisition
of consumer finance specialist Sovac by giant US conglomerate General
Electric Capital (GE Capital) at least shows a revival of foreign
interest in investing in those parts of the French financial industry
that remain profitable.

Foreigners' interest in making an important banking acquisition in
France has long been frustrated by various kinds of unavowed
protectionism. At the beginning of this decade, for example, Deutsche
Bank's international division was able to show journalists 36 fat
files, each one representing an acquisition target in France that had
to be ruled out for a series of reasons.

Now, in one fell swoop, a major international company has become one of
the major consumer credit providers in a market that has been
traditionally divided between a handful of national competitors and the
subsidiaries of the big commercial banks.

The acquisition, the third significant event in French banking in
recent months, has had the effect of a bombshell on the French retail
financial services industry and may herald a period of intense
manoeuvring. Already, rumours are rife that Banque Sofinco (another
consumer finance specialist and subsidiary of the troubled Suez
conglomerate) could come on the market, as may Credit du Nord, the weak
retail banking subsidiary of the Paribas group.

The fourth and final event demonstrating a new openness in the French
banking sector is the decision to end Credit Foncier de France's quasi-
monopoly over the distribution of subsidised housing loans, called
PAPs. This may be a sign that the state is beginning to contemplate
ending other privileges reserved for a number of state and quasi-state
banks.

Likewise, the decision to replace these PAPs with interest-free
mortgage loans that are open to all banks to distribute is an
indication that the authorities are conscious of the serious problems
facing the French financial industry.

That said, French banking remains ridden by a host of special
privileges accorded to some banks and not to others. The commercial
banks (members of the Association Francaise des Banques) periodically
mount campaigns to have the same right to flexible opening hours as the
savings and mutual banks and the post office. For a number of years,
they have also been striving to obtain the same access to fiscally
advantaged products as the mutual and savings banks. It remains
unlikely that, in this respect at least, French banking will change
radically in the near future.

The sudden increase in the tempo of change in French banking in 1995
follows a lot of soul searching among the financial industry, at the
root of which is a series of events, including bail-outs (most
spectacularly that of Credit Lyonnais) and the collapse last year of
Banque Pallas-Stern. The failure of the latter bank is especially
significant in that, for the first time in memory, a bank's
shareholders did not respond to the Bank of France's "invitation" to
help refloat their investment. This spells an end to France's much-
vaunted banking solidarity and points to the growing vulnerability of
small banks.

In addition, the AFB estimates that its members' net banking income
fell by 10 percent in 1995, having already dropped by 8 percent in
1994.

French banks in general can only look with envy on their "Anglo- Saxon"
cousins which, on average, have operating margins and returns on equity
that are two or three times higher than theirs. In the latest annual
survey of bank profitability undertaken by rating agency IBCA, the most
profitable French bank (Credit Immobilier de France) ranked only 84th
out of 300 institutions in the world.

In the words of one Paris analyst,"whereas French banks used to be able
to take justifiable pride in their quality of service and technological
prowess, now they have had to become seriously worried with the more
basic themes of low profitability and how to survive in a frighteningly
competitive environment".

Perhaps even more telling in the current upheaval is the growing
realisation that banks' real estate problems (which some analysts
estimate could cost a cumulative Fr100 billion-Fr200 billion by the end
of this decade) are not going to go away soon.

Here, too, a sea change can be detected. In 1994 and the first half of
1995 the Suez group, a financial and industrial conglomerate, took the
courageous step of writing down the massive real estate losses its
various subsidiaries had accumulated in previous years instead of
posting provisions that do not necessarily take into account possible
further falls in market values, as all Suez's domestic rivals have
done.

This provisioning effort cost Suez a total of Fr11.7 billion in the 18
months up to mid-1995 and contributed largely to the consolidated
losses of Fr8.8 billion in the same period.

At least this exercise should ensure that the much-troubled group sees
the light at the end of the tunnel fairly quickly. This may not be the
case for a number of other unfortunate institutions in France.

UK MARKET FAVOURS SHAREHOLDER APPROACH

AIMING TO double shareholder value every three years has over the last
decade driven Lloyds Bank's market capitalisation up from #1.35 billion
($2 billion) to #8.25 billion - on roughly the same share base.

The bank's equity has doubled from #2.1 billion to #4.06 billion, price
to book value has risen from 64 percent to more than 200 percent and
the dividend has increased at a compound rate of 15 percent.

Lloyds's pre-tax return on equity currently stands at 35.2 percent,
higher even than Spain's famously profitable bank, Banco Popular (33.6
percent), points out a recent report from Salomon Brothers.

This impressive performance, combined with widespread enthusiasm about
the bank's recent purchases of Church & General building society and
TSB Bank, have pushed the share price sky high. In fact, Salomon
Brothers's only proviso on a buy recommendation on Lloyds is that the
bank's shares have passed the #8.25- #8.50 price mark.

Both the C&G and TSB purchases fit the Lloyds criterion for a
successful financial institution of widening the gap with other
operators: C&G for its low-cost production in the mortgage market,
strong image-based technology and turnaround skills; and TSB for the
potential integration savings it offers as well as general insurance
skills that Lloyds has up to now had to buy in.

Salomon Brothers is particularly enthusiastic about the UK, despite the
fact that shares rallied so strongly in 1995. Buy Barclays, Lloyds,
NatWest and HSBC Holdings, Salomon Brothers advises, with a hold on
Abbey National. The favoured buy is HSBC, because the shares have
lagged the recovery in UK bank shares.

Salomon is less enthusiastic about other markets. In France, where it
considers the banks are not particularly good value in relation to
earnings, it has a hold recommendation on the major banks, although
preferring the quality of Societe Generale.

Italian banks, although cheap on book value, are expensive on an
earnings basis, Salomon argues, and better share performance will only
happen in the (currently unlikely) event of an improvement in political
and economic conditions. Top Italian choice is Istituto Mobiliare
Italiano (IMI) (see page 6).

Despite the fact that Salomon Brothers is bearish about operating
conditions in the Spanish market, it has upgraded its recommendation on
Argentaria to buy from hold in the light of the mounting speculation
about mergers and acquisitions. Salomon argues that the Spanish
government has no real interest in keeping any investment in Argentaria
in the medium term. Argentaria's break-up value is a lot higher than
current market capitalisation and the likely change of government in
1996 will allow a rethink of the privatisation agenda, the report
predicts.

Salomon Brothers has also kept a buy recommendation on Bank Bilbao
Vizcaya, another bank which focuses on shareholder value. Luis Bastida,
chief financial officer of BBV, told Salomon Brothers' Global
Conference that BBV has established ROE objectives of about 15 percent
for all main business lines. The bank will repurchase more stock if
market price falls below adjusted book value and is continuing to
maximise cost cuts from the 1998 Banco Bilbao/Banca Vizcaya merger.

In Germany, the favoured bank shares are Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.
In Switzerland, Salomon Brothers has downgraded its only buy
recommendation - Swiss Bank Corporation - to hold and cut the estimates
on the other three major banks, citing stagnant domestic banking
conditions and poor credit quality.

Salomon Brothers considers the Nordic banks, particularly Christiania
Bank, as among the best buys in Europe.

NEW CHANCES, NEW COSTS

While the large banks are in a good position to take advantage of the
new European financial regulations, the directives could be just too
much for many smaller players to handle

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has added two further pieces to the single
financial services market jigsaw - the Investment Services Directive
(ISD) and the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD).

Both came into effect on January 1 of this year and are likely to lead
to increased competition between stock exchanges and investment banks
alike, with larger players set to come out on top.

Only seven of the 15 member states were ready to implement the ISD at
the start of the new year, although all are adopting an "open door"
policy, according to the European Federation of Stock Markets. Those
that met the requirements were the UK, Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.

The main thrust of the ISD is to create a "European Passport" for non-
bank investment firms to carry out activities such as order collecting,
dealing and portfolio management more easily across borders.

Under the terms of the directive, any institution regulated in one EU
country can operate in all of the others without having to comply with
additional requirements.

The British Banking Association "warmly welcomes" the directives,
because they reinforce the basic right to cross-border financial
services, according to Peter Vipond, assistant director.

As in the case of the Second Banking Directive, the Association is
concerned that the interpretation of the ISD should not be conservative
or ambiguous (see EB 120).

Larger banks, already present in more than one EU country, can expect
lower costs as a result of the ISD but the directive will not have a
significant impact on their cross-border activities, predicted John
Leonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. Although some
member states have been strict on foreign players in the past, most
large banks have been free to operate where they choose.

"The ISD will have no effect whatsoever on our business, as we already
had the passport," said Dominique Hoenn, member of the board of
management at Groupe Paribas, France's second-largest banking group.
"It is a bit of a non-event for banks."

Smaller players operating in countries which have no regulations for
securities traders will, on the other hand, find themselves needing
authorisation for the first time.

The costs of keeping up with regulations may be too much and firms and
brokers could become overshadowed by the bigger investment banks which
will find it easier to adapt, Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and
capital markets at Price Waterhouse, forecast.

One market observer suggests that in terms of increased cross- border
activity US investment houses, such as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs, will be particularly keen to avail of the
opportunities presented by the ISD. Their authorisation in London will
allow them to spread out further into Europe.

A second objective of the ISD is to open up stock exchange membership
in all member states to all types of investment firm, whether bank or
non-bank entities. It will allow them to choose between indirect access
to membership through a subsidiary company or direct access through a
branch.

The ISD will lead to a surge in "remote membership" of stock exchanges,
according to market analysts, as it permits regulated markets operating
without a physical floor to provide terminals to investment firms and
banks in other member states.

This move will boost continental exchanges which have dramatically
modernised recently, said Jean-Pierre Paelinck, secretary general of
the European Federation of Stock Exchanges.

Indeed, the London exchange is on shaky ground at the moment after its
chief executive Michael Lawrence was forced to resign on January 4
because the board "lost confidence" in him. The board insists that this
has nothing to do with Lawrence's push for reform of trading on the
exchange this year. Few are convinced by the argument and a select
committee of the House of Commons has launched an inquiry into the
dismissal.

"Our objective is to be a market of choice," said John Kemp- Welch,
chairman of the board, who has taken over the chair of the executive
committee until a new chief executive is found. "To achieve that, we
have a large programme of work in train and this will be pursued
vigorously."

On the same day as Lawrence's departure, the board announced the
formation of a steering committee, which will oversee the decision
taken at the Stock Exchange Board meeting of November 30, concerning
market structure and regulation. The decision provides for the
Exchange's service to include full electronic trading and order
matching.

UK stockbroker NatWest Securities added fuel to the fire on January 2,
when it started to trade on the Swedish stock exchange from its offices
in London. It was the first leading UK market- maker to question
publicly the London Stock Exchange's function as a centre for
international trading.

Before the ISD came in, UK firms wanting to trade continental stocks
had to set up offices in other countries and apply for membership or
advertise their prices on Seaq International, the London Exchange's
electronic bulletin board for international dealing.

In Germany, Gruppe Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and
derivatives markets, has reacted to the ISD by installing "access
points" in London and Zurich to link to its systems and harmonising the
communications fees abroad with those at home, facilitating access to
the German market for foreign entrants.

Deutsche Borse plans to extend its electronic network to other
countries in the future, with the aim of bringing down all round
telecommunications costs.

Investment banks are likely to feel the effects of the Capital Adequacy
Directive (CAD) most, although the Directive also covers non-bank
investment firms. Under the directive, investment banks are required
for the first time to examine market risks when allocating capital.

Under the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive of 1993, banks can
carry out securities-related activities in addition to core banking
business, which means that banks and non-banks can be in direct
competition with each other in this area.

The CAD distinguishes between a bank's "trading book" and the rest of
its business (its investment portfolio and loans portfolio). It applies
broadly similar rules to the trading book as apply to the securities
business of non-bank investment firms in defining regulatory capital
and rules relating to the measurement of risk.

The rest of the bank's business is still subject to the requirements of
the Solvency Ratio Directive, which sets out an 8 percent minimum
capital requirement in respect of weighted credit risks.

Another element of the CAD is that banks and investment firms must
monitor risks at all times, keeping a close eye on large exposures.
Trading exposures to a single client will have to be restricted in most
cases to less than 25 percent of the capital base, for instance.

Analysts agree that market risks have been neglected in the past.
"Considering that Swiss banks make 29 percent of their total revenues
from trading, and the Barings collapse, it is clear that there are
risks there that should be dealt with," said Mark Rubenstein, European
banking analyst at BZW. "Banks will have to sit down and look more
carefully at the capital they need."

Banks have had two years to prepare for the CAD so on the whole they
are relatively unshaken by its arrival. The overall effect on holding
capital will be neutral and won't make much difference to banks,
according to Ian Linnell, investment banking analyst at Standard &
Poor's.

"The CAD will give a good kick to the market," he said, "but as a risk
management tool, it is not a magic silver bullet, it's too cumbersome".

Linnell suggests that investment banks themselves delegate risk control
in a much more efficient way than the CAD, a view held by many of the
banks themselves. Paribas is a case in point. Its own risk model uses
250 points of observation. "It is not clear whether we are permitted to
continue with our internal model," said Hoenn. "It would be stupid to
have to invest more in developing a new system just to comply with the
rules."

Indeed, the CAD will require increased expenditure on upgrading
technology, as it is a systems-based approach. "Everyone is investing
lots of money in systems, because they have one additional set of
calculations that has to be done concurrently and accurately," said
Leonard. IT investment among Europe's top banks ranges from as little
as 0.5 percent of asset value, according to a 1995 review of the top
100 largest spenders on IT by Spikes Cavell, the market intelligence
providers. Three banks appeared in the top ten spenders: Barclays was
number three spending $1.3 billion; ABN AMRO was number five with $960
million and Deutsche Bank ranked ninth with $814 million.

Smaller players may be crippled by the new overheads brought on by the
directives. At the end of the day, this factor, along with other
handicaps, such as lack of controlling models, will mean that the
increasingly "global" European market will become a stomping ground
mainly for big investment banks and investors.

"Larger banks can exploit their muscle on a wider front, and the
directives offer significant re-engineering opportunities," said
Aggarwal."The odds are definitely tilting towards larger players."

POLAND:  MERGER PLANS VIEWED WITH SUSPICION

POLISH BANKERS are less than enthusiastic about the government's new
approach to restructuring the banking sector.

The government has decided to merge seven state-owned banks into groups
led by Bank Handlowy y Warszawie and Polska Kasa Opieki (Bank Pekao).
Pekao is to take over Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Bank Depozytowo-
Kredytowy and the Treasury's 63 percent stake in the Polski Bank
Rozwoju (PBR). Handlowy would take over Pomorski Bank Kredytowy and the
Treasury's remaining 46.6 percent stake in Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy
(BPH).

Until now, the government has sold off four of the nine regional banks
one at a time - Bank Slaski, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, Bank
Przemyslowo-Handlowy and, most recently, Bank Gdanski. At the end of
last year, it sold a domestic tranche of 35.8 percent of the Gdanski
shares, and foreign investors bought all 25 percent of shares on offer
abroad. Poland's eleventh- largest bank, Bank Iniciatyw Gospodarczych
(BIG) bought 24.07 percent of the bank.

Privatisation of the institutions remaining in state hands is expected
in late 1996 or in 1997. Although the new strategy of grouping the
banks could simplify an eventual privatisation "a more jaundiced view
held by some market players is that the consolidation strategy is
merely a ploy for reasserting control over the banking system, a theory
that would be borne out if Bank Handlowy and Pekao are not privatised,"
points out rating agency Standard & Poor's.

Shareholders of BPH and of PBR, as well as the management of the
regional banks, have raised objections. The plan can only succeed if
the two banks are free of political influence, Handlowy president
Cezary Stypulkowski has said.

Standard & Poor's also argue that the consolidation "would not
significantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,
or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range for
zloty-denominated obligations".

The rating agency points out that in the near term the mergers would
bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio and that
integration could be difficult.

"However, longer term, the greater diversity and market share could be
positive factors. Bank Handlowy would gain more retail deposits and
commercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution network
and possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertise
of Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail broker
strength."

THE UNWANTED DISTRACTION

While Italian banks are keen to grow, in recent times they have been
cutting back on foreign expansion. Now the smaller, more flexible banks
seem to be in the best position to exploit opportunities quickly

THE ONGOING troubles of Italian banks as they come to terms with
deregulation, privatisation and a more open and competitive market have
been well documented. A less well-publicised aspect of the large-scale
changes underway has been the quiet scaling down or even complete
withdrawal from operations abroad.

Most of the Italian banks' foreign expansion happened in the 1980s, on
the back of a buoyant economy at home when politically- controlled
banks could afford prestigious offices in major capitals and branch
networks in the more important markets. More recently, though,
recession and the arrival of private investment have brought more
pressing concerns at home and foreign expansion appears to have become
an unwanted distraction.

IMI, the Rome-based bank privatised last year, was one of the more
active and successful of the Italian banks abroad. Determinedly
independent from political interference, it became an efficient
operator in international investment banking and capital markets.

In 1993 Massimo Amato, managing director, of IMI International in
Luxembourg, echoed the bank's president when he said optimistically
that "IMI is a truly international bank and our intention is to become
a European institution of the highest calibre".

The bank certainly had the right credentials for satisfying the
ambitions of its management and may well have achieved their objectives
but for one costly mistake - the acquisition of the US investment bank,
Mabon Securities, for around $20 million in 1991. Little is known of
exactly what went wrong, but only two years after the purchase the bank
was said to be looking for a buyer. Problems appear to have been
concentrated in the subsidiary, Cedar Street, particularly in London,
where management walked out en masse to join a rival.

In September 1995 IMI announced that it was restructuring its
investment banking operations so that it could concentrate on Italian
markets and its lira-denominated products. It also revealed that IMI
Capital Markets, the sole owner of Mabon Securities, was to have $30
million injected into it. Little over a month later Cedar Street was
sold to a US securities dealer, MKI. There has been no mention of
losses and little coverage in the Italian press, although IMI's balance
sheet could be L60 billion ($38 million) the worse in 1995 and Mabon
Securities faces liquidation.

The mistake severely compromised IMI's other foreign operations and the
bank also closed its Frankfurt-based venture, leaving the Luxembourg
bank as the only serious foreign-based bank. Even Luxembourg's role was
downgraded and Massimo Amato returned to a high ranking position with a
medium-sized bank in Italy last year.

Banca Nazionale del Lavoro has also had well-publicised problems in its
foreign subsidiaries and has reduced its once large US operation to its
New York offices.

Other groups have suffered from market pressures. Comit, the banking
group containing Banca Commerciale Italiana, is looking to cut its
operation in France. Comit entered the French market at much the same
time as IMI was beginning its foreign expansion programme, buying Banca
Sudameris France. Losses in the French operation have forced the bank
to look for buyers of most of the 19 branches.

Banco di Napoli may also be looking for buyers in France. The Naples
bank had record losses last year and other Italian banks have bailed it
out on condition that it implements an effective restructuring
programme. This will almost certainly include the disposal of foreign
operations in France and Luxembourg.

Another casualty of the tough French market was the bank owned by
Olivetti owner Carlo De Benedetti, Dumenil Leble, which after L900
billion losses over the last five years will be put into liquidation at
the end of January.

In many cases, the purpose behind withdrawal has been to concentrate
resources on the home front where, ironically, foreign banks are
becoming increasingly active. Leaner foreign banks are increasingly
looking to exploit weaknesses in the cumbersome Italian banking system.

One of the major recent problems is the rift between Italian industry
and its banking counterparts over lending rates. The needs of smaller
exporting companies for competitive rates are quite clearly not being
met. All leading banks in Italy raised their lending rates by O.5
percent to 0.75 percent in November leaving industrialists dissatisfied
and rebellious.

Mario Carraro, head of the Veneto region's industrial association, has
little doubt that foreign banks are exploiting the rift and Italian
companies are responding.

"Working with strong currencies we can get loans at 8 percent," he
said. "Our [local] economy is primarily based on exports . .
Republic or Poland we need advice and support from banks."

The largest Italian banks appear to be the ones finding this sort of
service more difficult to offer. Often it is the smaller banks with
strong roots in particular regions that are now exploiting the
opportunities presented abroad. For example, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-
Credito Varesino, which bought the Swiss Banque de Depots et de Gestion
in 1994, says that foreign expansion is limited to creating a network
in the areas that have strong links with the home base in Lombardy.

Similarly, the Banca Popolare di Verona group, which is based in the
eastern region of Veneto, has opened offices in eastern Europe"because
that is where our clients are going for their work".

The new approach to international expansion is much more pragmatic and
often the players are the second-tier banks. This creates something of
a contradiction for the industry. On the one hand, Italy's banks are
keen to grow, with even the biggest groups small by international
standards. On the other hand, it seems to be the smaller flexible
operators which are better able to exploit openings quickly.

TAKING FRIENDSHIP A STAGE FURTHER

Westdeutsche Landesbank has formed two alliances which mark another
stage in the evolution of cross-border business at German banks. The
other Landesbanks would be well-advised to follow suit, EB reports

THE RECENT co-operation agreement between Westdeutsche Landesbank
(WestLB) and Bank Austria has created a three-way alliance between
Germany's largest Landesbank and its counterparts in Austria and Italy,
where Cariplo forms the third point of the triangle.

The strategy marks a further departure from the Landesbanks'
traditional business profile, although it is still too early to say
whether these co-operation agreements will generate significant new
business.

It is some years now since WestLB moved beyond its original job
description as local banker and lender of last resort to the public
sector in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. As competitive pressures
grew on the local savings banks (Sparkassen), which buy their wholesale
banking services from WestLB, the Landesbank found it needed to offer
better products and services and to earn more than their traditional
low-interest municipal lending business could offer.

That way of thinking led WestLB to move into corporate business and
then, as a natural consequence, into capital markets and international
commercial banking. WestLB has since grown to become Germany's third-
largest bank and is currently bolstering its London investment bank,
known as West Merchant Bank, into a significant rival to private-sector
domestic competitors, Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank.

Under the terms of the German bank's agreement with Bank Austria, which
was signed just before Christmas, each becomes the other's"preferred
partner" for cross-border financial transactions, particularly in
foreign commercial business, international payments, currency clearing
and securities business.

Bank Austria's experience in eastern Europe will be invaluable. WestLB
has established branches in a number of central and eastern European
capitals but does not have the broad network that the Austrians have
already established.

The German's other partner is Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie
Lombarde (Cariplo), the Italian bank. WestLB's ultimate aim is to
construct a network of partner banks in all the main European markets.

WestLB's aspirations in investment banking have taken up plenty of time
and resources over the past year and the man with chief responsibility
for the new alliances with Cariplo and Bank Austria is Hans-Henning
Offen, deputy chairman of the board of management and one of the two
board members responsible for investment banking. Bank sources say it
will take a good year before any substantial progress can be announced,
although quicker results might be achieved in cross-border payments.

It is clear that WestLB, the wholesale banker and umbrella for 150
local savings banks in the Rhine and Ruhr region, has chosen to rely on
alliances with other savings bank institutions. Bank Austria is a
savings bank sector institution and, like WestLB, has grown
prodigiously. Cariplo comes from the same roots and is often referred
to as the world's largest savings bank.

These upper-tier banks choose to co-operate with one another because
they understand the difficulties of convincing local savings banks to
market new products to customers rather than being able to approach
customers directly. The structure of the savings bank sector in almost
any European country usually means delays and it sometimes results in
painful, politically charged compromises.

Other state-owned banks understand that the German Landesbanks are
obliged to take on some unrewarding business, such as low- interest
credits or the administration of subsidies, for local authorities.
Since they understand each other better than private sector banks
would, the alliances between WestLB, Cariplo and Bank Austria have a
better chance of success.

WestLB's recent activities in the capital markets suggest that the
Landesbanks are still wary of liaisons with private sector
institutions. West Merchant Bank in London is being fashioned into a
competitor for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner/Kleinwort Benson.
Possibly because there is no savings bank institution with sufficient
expertise in investment banking, WestLB has chosen to go it alone. Even
the domestic competition was ousted: Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, a
minority shareholder in West Merchant Bank, was bought out so that
WestLB could avoid internal competition from German or foreign banks
with similar constituencies.

As for Bayerische Landesbank, NordLB, Helaba and the other German
Landesbanks, it is a fair bet that their future strategy will be
inspired by that of WestLB, which has long been the largest and most
international of the 13 Landesbanks.

Bayerische Landesbank, in particular, is investing heavily in other
European markets. Over the past two years, chief executive Franz
Neubauer has purchased shareholdings in the Hungarian Foreign Trade
Bank, the Czech Savings Bank in Prague, the Sudtiroler Sparkasse in
Italy - and now the Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft in Vienna.

Others are more tardy. One reason is that their energy is being sapped
by problems and challenges at home - and by the constant effort of
expanding in order to keep level with WestLB. Norddeutsche Landesbank,
Helaba and Bayerische Landesbank are negotiating a far-reaching co-
operation on everything from edp systems to international strategy.
NordLB has already bought a stake in BGB.

Traditional banking alliances are still being made with banks in
emerging markets. Bayerische Landesbank has just signed an agreement on
the financing of German exports to Russia with Inkombank, the country's
largest commercial bank. But the Bavarians are not taking any risks:
all the long-term deals concerned will be covered by the German export
guarantee agency Hermes; others will be guaranteed by the Russian
Ministry of Finance or covered by barter deals. Indeed, Bayern LB has
been sensible enough to keep its initial objectives modest.

But the other Landesbanks will have to move quickly into more strategic
alliances if WestLB, Cariplo, Bank Austria and whichever new partner
next emerges are not to steal away their regional business. Although
WestLB is still formally committed to the Rhine/Ruhr region, it now
acts for corporate customers all over Germany.

MUTUAL FUNDS READY FOR TAKE-OFF

Though they still lag far behind US investors, Britons are beginning to
appreciate the benefits of mutual funds, thanks in no small part to
Virgin's Richard Branson

ONE OF the most fascinating developments in the retail financial
services sector over the last ten years has been the rise of the mutual
fund in the US. The Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF) is displacing the
traditional bank deposit. The volume of assets held in MMMFs now
exceeds the cash held in call or demand deposits. Conventional mutual
funds are winning market share in the longer-term savings market.
Overall, around 30 percent of US households own mutual funds.

In the UK, however, mutual funds have failed to arouse the same depth -
and breadth - of interest. Indeed, in some respects the UK mutual fund
sector lags behind that of mainland Europe.

Unit trusts, the UK equivalent of the open-ended investment fund, have
had their moments, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
More recently, the sector experienced a minor boom in 1993 on the back
of rising stockmarkets.

In the intervening periods, however, the unit trust has failed to
excite the British punter. The number of unitholder accounts reached a
peak of 2.4 million in 1970 and declined throughout the 1970s, reaching
a trough of 1.72 million. Interest in unit trusts recovered during the
1980s on the back of booming stockmarkets but it was not until 1985
that the 1970 peak was exceeded.

Interest subsided following the crash of 1987 before moving onto new
highs during the 1990s. Currently the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds (AUTIF), the sector's trade association, estimates
that there are 6.58 million unit trust accounts, with total assets of
#109 billion ($168 billion).

Since investors typically hold units in more than one fund, the overall
number of unit trust holders is probably much less. In 1993 AUTIF
estimated that there were only around 1.5 million individual investors -
 around 3 percent of the total population.

There are a number of reasons for this situation. The fact that UK
banks have tended to pay interest not dissimilar to money market rates
on bank deposits has diminished the attraction of MMMFs. Unit trusts
have had to compete on an unfavourable basis with the attractions of
alternative long-term savings products such as life assurance
contracts. Until the advent of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP), mutual
funds were not in receipt of any form of fiscal privilege. By way of
contrast, until 1984 tax relief was offered on life assurance premiums.

The relative attraction of life assurance contracts was enhanced by the
fact that they were a preferred way of funding residential mortgages.
For a significant part of the post-war period residential property has
been perceived by the average Briton as the investment par excellence.

From the manufacturer's point of view, life assurance contracts offered
other attractions. The fact that the investment value of a life
assurance policy was relatively opaque - investors just assumed that
they would receive a large sum of money when the contract was
terminated - obscured the risks associated with this type of
instrument. More pertinently, in an age of non- disclosure, it opened
the way for high costs and fees to be passed directly to the customer.

Unit trusts were more transparent. Investment losses or poor
performance quickly came to light. Costs were also much more visible
and off-putting. The nature of the contract permitted only limited
opportunities for realising commission income. In contrast to their
peers in the US, the UK mutual fund companies seemed incapable of
coming up with anything that would positively enhance the unit trust's
image.

In fact, they often seemed intent on the reverse. Loads and annual
management charges were allowed to creep up. UK companies even turned
down the UK government's invitation to introduce legislation permitting
the introduction of open-ended investment companies (OIECs), a mutual
fund structure which has become the norm elsewhere.

There is at last evidence, however, to suggest that the tide may be
turning, irrespective of the behaviour of stockmarkets (always an
important factor as far as the public's appetite for unit trusts is
concerned).

A key element in this respect was the decision by the UK government to
make qualifying unit trusts fully eligible for inclusion in PEPs.
Investors can now shelter from both income and capital gains tax up to
6,000 of unit trust investments per annum. For the first time, unit
trusts have a more favourable tax status than life assurance contracts.

The relative attraction of life assurance contracts has been undermined
by a combination of factors. The scandals associated with the way in
which these and other long-term savings contracts such as personal
pensions were sold, the advent of disclosure and the inflexibility of
these contracts have all impeded their sale.

More importantly, competition has finally arrived. There has been an
explosion in new products, especially"life-style products" such as unit
trust savings plans linked to school and college fees, mortgage
repayments and pensions. Price competition has also picked up. No-load
funds, with very low annual management fees, are becoming increasingly
common.

As is often the case, when the history of the UK mutual fund sector
comes to be written, credit for these changes will probably be
attributed to an outsider: Virgin's Richard Branson. His launch of a
low-cost index tracking fund in early 1995 was an important catalyst.
Close on Branson's heels, HSBC, River & Mercantile, Legal & General and
Fidelity Investments have all introduced low-cost index trackers.
Indeed, since the index tracker appears to have captured the public's
imagination, other suppliers are set to join them in the near future.

Will the UK be converted to the merits of the mutual fund? The
situation is certainly much more promising. The arrival of the OIEC
later this year, low-risk corporate bond trusts, low costs, low
interest rates and (hopefully) booming stockmarkets, coupled with
greater marketing awareness on the part of the fund companies, should
provide the basis for take-off. As usual, however, time will tell.

WAITING FOR THE TELEKOM BONANZA

The biggest flotation in European history represents every banker's
hopes for improved earnings in 1996

THE NEW Year has begun and Deutsche Telekom is the name on every German
banker's lips: the national telecommunications group is not only set to
launch the biggest flotation in European history, but represents every
banker's hopes for improved earnings in 1996.

If the DM15 billion ($10.4 billion) sale of Telekom shares goes well,
every bank in the land will share in the bonanza. But, if demand is
weak, banks could be left holding the stock themselves for months or
even years.

By that simple logic, it seems self-evident that the banks will try
every tactic and ruse to encourage investors to buy the nation's first
telecoms shares. That is what the German government hoped when it
decided last year not to create new tax breaks on share ownership in
order to encourage the German public to buy Telekom stock.

Instead, the government and Deutsche Telekom's own management have
appealed to the banks to invent (and pay for) whatever incentives they
think necessary to make the new shares attractive.

By placing the ball so firmly in the banks' court, the German
government is perpetuating the old belief that banks are not just
commercial organisations which aim to maximise profits for their
shareholders but also have a duty to offer financial support to
deserving parts of the economy.

It is a curious reflection of the German consensus model that banks too
are regarded as official sponsors of economic and social change.

Banks may rage about this outdated view but the Telekom debate has put
them in a difficult dilemma. All of the major banks were so eager to
win places in the Telekom issuing syndicate that they were driven to
make extravagant promises.

Deutsche Bank, one of the global coordinators, and Dresdner Bank,
coordinator for the German market, are said to have made a personal
pledge to German chancellor Helmut Kohl that the Telekom issue would be
a success at all costs. And the government's favour is all-important
for banks which want a prominent role in future privatisation issues
such as Deutsche Bahn and Postbank.

In January 1996, just weeks before the marketing campaign begins for a
mammoth placement that cannot be postponed any longer, it is now
evident what responsibility the banks face. That burden rests
particularly on the shoulders of Dresdner Bank.

Unless the banks forgo bank charges, they may not be able to sell
sufficient stock to establish investor confidence. And if demand is
weak the banks will be blamed - and will end up forced to buy the
unwanted shares. Indeed, outsiders may never find out how much genuine
demand there really was for Telekom stock.

We can only speculate what the results of the Telekom issue will be. If
banks do have to provide special incentives for private investors, that
will set a trend for all future privatisations and could have a radical
effect on bank charges in Germany.

It will also create a new interdependence between the retail banking
and capital markets division of the big German banks. That will be
unwelcome at institutions which are trying to create more autonomy in
each division, but it may be unavoidable.

CHANGES IN GERMAN MARKET

RETAIL BANKERS in Germany have been confronted by dozens of innovations
over the past 18 months: discount broking was followed by direct
banking, dual-branded credit cards, free banking and now Internet
broking.

But before any home grown innovators, such as the pioneer discount
broker Direkt-Anlage Bank, could find the time and the money to reach
out to foreign markets, German brokers have found themselves defending
their crumbling market from foreigners. Credit Suisse, for instance,
recently launched a direct brokerage in Germany.

The appearance of foreign competitors is nothing new. US-based
investment banks created a stir in the late 1980s when they established
operations in Frankfurt and began to attract capital markets business
away from German institutions. The expertise they brought to Frankfurt
propelled German banks into acquiring the same experience themselves.
With hindsight, German bankers agree that the foreign investment
bankers have been beneficial for the Frankfurt marketplace.

They are still classified as"foreign banks" and few belong to the
mainstream Association of German Banks, but in fact institutions like
Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Swiss Bank Corporation now pursue
much the same objectives as domestic banks. That recognition is the key
to the successful development of Finanzplatz Frankfurt in future.

All 135 foreign banks in Frankfurt - even the branches which simply
administer commercial business for clients from home - are concerned
about the minimum reserve requirement, the supervision of derivatives
business, the new electronic systems of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
and the improvement of international payment systems.

Although the financial legislation of 1994 introduced some reforms,
notably the establishment of a securities trading supervisory office,
both Germans and foreign banks complain that the changes have not yet
gone far enough. The finance ministry in Bonn is being lobbied by
various banking groups which hope to see a number of changes in the
forthcoming Third Financial Markets Promotion Act.

Ideally, the banks would like to see abolition of the minimum reserve,
rapid implementation of the capital adequacy directive and immediate
issue of short-term government debt.

With the finance ministry still smarting from the decision of the big
German banks to shift important capital markets operations to London or
New York, it is important for the banking community to present a united
front. That will be enormously beneficial in persuading both the
finance ministry and the Bundesbank that a free-market and not a
protectionist approach will best secure a promising future for
Finanzplatz Frankfurt.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BOOSTS CREDITANSTALT

CREDITANSTALT, Austria's second-largest bank and long-time
privatisation target, has announced an increase in consolidated net
income of 16 percent, largely due to a strong international
performance.

Foreign business, which accounted for half of the consolidated balance
sheet, generated about two-thirds of the group's net income. The
group's net profit went up to Sch2.2 billion ($215 million) in 1995
from Sch1.9 billion a year earlier. Its operating result rose to Sch5.9
billion, up 4 percent and 40 percent higher than that of the domestic
operation Creditanstalt- Bankverein AG.

Domestic business suffered from weak credit demand, a shift to low-
interest, short-term loans and pressure on the interest margin, Guido
Schmidt-Chiari, group chairman, said on January 9. Earnings from
industrial holdings were up but provisions for loans to domestic
customers were up to Sch3.1 billion, from Sch2.7 billion in 1994.

In its recent Banking System Outlook for Austria, Moody's rating agency
expressed concern about the country's poor banking returns. After
Belgium, Austria is the most overbanked country in the European Union -
at end 1994 one bank or bank branch served only 1,384 people.

Unlike Austria's bankers, Moody's is not sure that the thin returns
will deter foreign entrants. This might, Moody's believes, "(a) only be
true during the near-term, and (b) hold only for the more plain vanilla
banking products and services".

Creating shareholder value has not been an overriding strategic
objective for Austrian banks. The politicised system has not only
contributed to the delay in selling the government's 49 percent stake
in Creditanstalt and 20 percent of Bank Austria but means that it will
be difficult for banks to improve their cost structure, Moody's argues.

Inherent competitive cost advantages "may enable more efficient foreign
entrants to compete against domestic institutions with some success",
the report says. It predicts that the country's financial markets will
become more exposed to domestic asset and savings disintermediation and
to cross-border competition "that is likely to focus on niche markets
such as mutual funds, lease finance and credit cards".

Faced with pressure at home, Creditanstalt, like Austria's other
leading banks, has been turning its attention to eastern Europe. In
this region, where Creditanstalt has to date invested Sch1.9 billion,
the bank's accumulated operating result rose from Sch330 million to
Sch366 million.

Moody's warns that competition may, in the medium term, make banking
activities in eastern Europe less attractive than they looked
initially. It also cautions that the extent and volatility of risk is
difficult to quantify.

AXA AND GENERALI TIDY UP LINKS

AXA, THE French insurance group, and Italian insurer Generali are
restructuring their complicated cross-shareholdings in a bid to develop
their long-standing but so far not very strategically productive
relationship.

AXA has announced a Fr5.9 billion ($1.19 billion) capital increase and
a restructuring which will give Generali a direct holding of 11 percent
in the French insurer.

Generali and AXA have been entangled since 1990, when AXA bought French
insurer Compagnie de Midi. At that time, the companies set up two joint
control and development holdings: Midi Participations, which is 60
percent owned by Finaxa and 40 percent by Generali; and Generali Midi
Expansion (GME), which is 60 percent held by Generali and 40 percent by
AXA.

Under the new agreement, Midi Participations will be dissolved and
Generali will buy back AXA's 40 percent reciprocal stake in GME. The
groups have also agreed to finalise a shareholder agreement by February
15, reaffirming their intention to seek joint development opportunities
and "barring unforeseen circumstances" to maintain their shareholdings
at current levels.

Generali observers have been speculating about possibly heavier French
involvement since June last year, when Eugenio Coppola di Cazano
stepped down as Generali chairman and chief executive for health
reasons. He was replaced as chairman by Antoine Bernheim, general
partner of Lazard Freres, the Paris financial group which owns 4.7
percent of Generali's equity.

At the beginning of that month, Generali had signed an agreement to
fuse its French subsidiary with La France group, indirectly controlled
by Lazard Freres, creating France's 11th-largest non- life insurer,
Generali France Holding.

CL AWAITS DECISION OF COMMISSION

THE CONFUSION surrounding the future of Credit Lyonnais's branch
network continues. The European Commission in Brussels is shortly due
to spell out clearly how the bank is to proceed in selling off 35
percent of its commercial banking assets abroad, including 50 percent
of those in Europe outside France, before the end of 1998 - the price
the bank has had to pay for its massive state bail-out (see EB).

This would mean dismantling the French banks' expensively acquired
branch network, with the exception of BfG Bank in Germany, the largest
and most profitable of Credit Lyonnais's European units and the one it
most earnestly wants to keep.

But this would also seem to be in contradiction of the assertion by
Phillippe Cloes, managing director of Credit Lyonnais Belgium, that his
bank was "not on the list of sell-offs" and a similar statement made by
managers at Credit Lyonnais's Swiss unit.

The protocol signed between the Commission and the French state which
stipulates that the 1998 deadline can be extended if the sale of assets
leads to "large losses" or "forces the main shareholder [the state] to
give fresh financial support". The bank's own board of directors has
stated that it will be "very careful that future disinvestments do not
lead to a decline in the bank's financial standing".

Credit Lyonnais has also announced the opening of a branch in the
Netherlands, designed to serve the bank's corporate customers. This
comes just a few months after the sale of the scandal-ridden Credit
Lyonnais Bank-Nederland to the Belgian Generale de Banque as part of
the rationalisation of its non-domestic network.

HYPO STEPS BACK IN THE EAST

HYPO SERVICE Bank (HSB), the wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayerische
Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, Germany's fifth-largest bank, has cut
nearly one-fifth of its branches in the new federal states.

Set up in 1992 as a low-budget bank for private clients in east
Germany, HSB lost DM28 million ($19 million) in 1995. It closed nine of
its 46 branches and let go 30 of its 280 staff in late December last
year in a bid to halve these losses by the end of 1996.

"The branches were simply unprofitable and had too few customers." said
Lothar Lanz, board member at HSB. So far Hypo- Bank has invested about
DM50 million in HSB, which currently has 110,000 customers and a
balance sheet total of DM1.5 billion.

Deutsche Bank has built up a network of 400 branches in the new Federal
States in two-and-a-half years and plans to maintain it, a spokesman
said. "It makes sense to build up a branch network, although not all
are profitable," he said. Germany's number one bank acquired 120 of
these offices through a joint venture with Deutsche Kredit Bank,
formerly an exclusively east German bank. It currently has 90 branches
in west Berlin alone.

Bayerische Vereinsbank has a widely spread network of over 100 branch
offices, built up since reunification. The bank expects corporate
business to get riskier in the coming years because a lot of state
schemes will peter out.

It also expects margins to narrow in the retail sector because
competition will be largely price-based and, for this reason, is
promoting phone banking and on-line banking.

Dresdner Bank, which has 250 branches in the new federal states, sees
"no need for cuts".

GE CAPITAL BUYS INTO BUDAPEST BANK

GE CAPITAL, the financial services arm of the US General Electric
Company, has succeeded in its efforts to buy Sovac, the French finance
company, and a controlling stake in Budapest Bank, Hungary's second
largest bank.

The Sovac board accepted GE's public offer of Fr610 ($123) per share
(or Fr7.7 billion) on December 19. The US non-bank, now holds 97.49
percent of Sovac's capital, making it one of the major consumer credit
providers in France in one fell swoop (see EB 119).

In Hungary, GE Capital has bought 27.5 percent of Budapest Bank's
shares and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's 32.5
percent for a combined price of $87 million. The move means that
Budapest Bank can hold on to a state capital injection of HUF3 million
($22,000), which it received at the beginning of last year. (see EB
119)

LEPETIT QUITS INDOSUEZ

THE COMPLETION of Banque Indosuez's strategic review has also brought
to an end Jean-Francois Lepetit's career with the bank. Lepetit
resigned as chief executive on January 15"to pursue other interests
outside the group".

He has been replaced by Christian Maurin, who takes on the functions of
chairman and chief executive. Compagnie de Suez chairman Gerard
Mestrallet becomes chairman of the supervisory board.

Maurin comes from Banque Sofinco, where he has been chief executive
since 1991. Sofinco is now France's second-ranked consumer credit
institution, with return on equity of 20 percent.

The Suez group has been working to restructure and streamline in order
to combat huge losses. In the first six months of 1995, it made a net
loss of Fr3.976 billion ($800 million), largely due to real estate
losses. Banque Indosuez reported net losses of Fr16 million after
transferring Fr5.6 billion of real estate assets to Compagnie de Suez
(EB 118).

On January 23, Banque Indosuez shareholders were due to vote on whether
to transform Banque Indosuez into a company governed by a supervisory
board and an executive board.

KLEINWORT BENSON BUYS WARBURG LEASING

KLEINWORT BENSON, the UK investment bank taken over last year by
Dresdner Bank, has bought the leasing finance and advisory subsidiaries
of rival SBC Warburg, formed through Swiss Bank Corporation's takeover
of SG Warburg, for an undisclosed sum.

Kleinwort Benson has bought most of the former SBC Warburg big ticket
leasing portfolio and an executive team of ten individuals and will
integrate the new business into its financing department.

Buying SBC Warburg's subsidiaries almost doubles Kleinwort Benson's
leasing asset base, estimated to be around #450 million ($696 million).

The SBC Warburg business is a good match because many of its contracts
were with existing Kleinwort customers, John Cameron, joint head of
financing at Kleinwort, said. It also opens up opportunities for the
expansion of the advisory business.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has taken on three utilities
analysts from Kleinwort Benson, to work on pan-European research.

CHASING THE `EUROCONSUMER'

All European branches now sport the Citibank label and the bank's aim
is to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Cola is
to the soft drinks industry. Sorcha Corcoran reports

OFTEN DESCRIBED as the only true pan-European retail bank, Citibank,
the banking arm of US multi-finance group Citicorp, now generates
nearly one-third of its total revenues in Europe. Germany continues to
be Citibank's European shining star but the bank is also pushing its
global strategy of providing services "anywhere, anytime, anyhow", in
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and, most recently,
the UK.

There have been rumours that Citibank will reorganise its European
retail operations in view of former head of retail banking Victor
Menezes' recent promotion to corporate finance officer at Citicorp. A
decision on reorganisation will be made in the next couple of months
but no comment is available yet.

Up to now, Citibank in Europe has stuck closely to its global retail
strategy, pursued in 41 countries worldwide. This is to provide
upscale, premium financial services, with a multinational service
network, through a minimal number of branches, supplemented with
telephone and ATM service.

"We aim to deliver private customers the same bank services in the same
branches across Europe," Folkert Mindermann, managing director of
Citibank Privatkunden AG, the German consumer bank, told EB. "It is a
region where we expect considerable growth in revenues."

The bank's considerable success in the lucrative European consumer
market is largely due to the fact that its niche strategy minimises
frontal attacks, argued a recent study of the Citicorp organisation,
Citicorp Europe - Refashioning Itself for the Nineties, published by
analysts Salomon Brothers.

Citibank has defined its retail target as "internationally aware,
performance demanding and located primarily in large population
centres". The middle-income market needs most attention in the near
future, Mindermann said.

Excluding the card business, Europe contributed $1.5 billion to
Citibank's total consumer revenues in 1995, representing 30 percent of
total revenues, Mindermann said. There are 500 consumer branches in
Europe, nearly half the world total of 1,200, and the bank employs
7,000 people in the region. Assets came to $50 billion last year.

The consumer business is as much a marketing company as a bank. The
aim: to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Cola
is to the soft drinks industry. All European branches now sport the
Citibank label and Citibank has introduced the "model branch" concept,
in which the same signage, architecture and operating systems are used
in Citibank branches around the world.

In these branches, consumers have access to Customer Activated
Terminals (CATs), an advanced touchscreen system that recognises from
the customer's PIN what language to use. Every Citibank customer has a
Citicard, which can be tied to several accounts, even with different
currencies.

An important feature of Citibank's Euro-attack is its integrated
network, Mindermann said. The bank moved nine consumer banking data
centres scattered around Europe to a single location at Meerbusch,
Germany in 1994. All European branches now have access to account
information on line.

"Citibank is the only European bank with one integrated system,"
Mindermann said. "For this reason it is the highest ranked in Europe in
terms of consumer orientation."

The integrated electronic data processing system improves cost and
control and allows Citibank to roll out new products more quickly,
Salomon Brothers notes. The bank need simply transfer "existing
systems, products and methodologies using infrastructure, experience
and language skills available elsewhere in the network", the report
points out.

One key business area in Europe is cards. Citibank had 1 million credit
card accounts in 1995 and by the end of the millennium this should grow
to 5 million, predicted Roberta Arena, head of cards in the US and
Europe. To minimise unit costs, the bank is transferring European
transactions across the Atlantic to Citibank's processing centre in
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Citicorp started its regional credit card effort in 1989, beginning
with four countries - Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain. In five
years, the card base had grown to 500,000. The bank has become the
largest issuer in Greece since then and is now opening accounts in two
new countries each year.

Establishing cards businesses was a "gruesomely expensive" five year
effort, Arena said. High entry costs will, however, benefit Citibank by
discouraging other players from entering its selected markets, she
forecast.

Arena expects Citibank to be the number one card issuer in Germany
before long. At the end of 1994 it ranked fourth and was within 50,000
cards of Deutsche Bank.

In a move which alarmed traditionalists, Citibank has launched a co-
branded card with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway. The dual-branding
offer allows holders of the Bahncard rail discount card to add a Visa
or Electron payment function at no additional charge.

A legal battle ensued as the German competition authority, Zentrale zur
Bekampfung des unlauteren Wettbewerbs, opposed the deal, deeming it
unlawful. Citibank won the case in November and now claims that its
Bahncard has the potential to revolutionise the cards industry in a
market viewed by many observers as still underpenetrated. There are
already 3 million Bahncard holders in Germany, and their numbers are
set to rise to 5 million over the next couple of years.

Indeed, Germany stands out for Citibank in more ways than one. As the
largest and oldest retail bank (founded in 1926), Citibank Privatkunden
AG generates over 50 percent of European revenues. Of the 500 European
branches, 300 are German, and 4,000 of the 7,000 employees are located
there.

At end-September 1995, the balance sheet total of Citibank Privatkunden
AG came to DM15.9 billion ($11 billion), up from DM15.2 billion at the
end of 1994. It now serves 2.5 million customers with 4.4 million bank
accounts, insurance policies, Citibank Visa cards and home savings
agreements.

Mindermann attributes much of Citibank's German success to the
acquisition of Kundenkreditbank in 1974. "Kundenkreditbank was very
strong at that time, with a good branch network," he said.

Although among the highest returning banks in Germany for many years,
the bank was traditionally a blue-collar-oriented company with limited
growth. Citibank revamped the bank in 1989, establishing a more upscale
image through enhancing service and marketing.

Unique to Germany so far is CitiPhone Direct Banking, a full banking
and financial service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with personal
service by telephone. Citibank, as the pioneer of telephone banking in
Germany in 1989, started the new service in October 1995.

Previously only cash transactions were possible over the phone. Now,
customers use a personal password and identification number for
telephone handling of savings-account, investment, securities, credit
and insurance business. Only one signature is needed for all accounts.

"CitiPhone Direct Banking has got off to a very good start," said
Mindermann. "Already we have reached more than 3,000 new customers, and
are receiving an average of 1,500 calls a day. Most people are
interested in all the services offered."

Citibank plans to use the Aachen-based telecentre for CitiPhone Direct
Banking to target customers in other European countries. Aachen is well
situated for this purpose in the German, Dutch and Belgian border
triangle, close to France and within easy reach of the UK, so that
staff with mother tongues can easily be recruited.

In order to tap new market potential in Germany, Citibank entered in
December into an extensive collaboration agreement with HDI
Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie, the country's seventh
largest insurance group.

HDI is taking over the entire insurance operations of the Citibank
Group in Germany through the purchase of all shares in its insurance
holding company, Citifinanzleistungen GmbH. This company holds all the
shares in Citi Lebensversicherung, set up in 1985 and in Citi
Versicherung, set up in 1992. A purchase price has not been disclosed.

Under the agreement, Citibank will integrate the products of HDI into
the marketing channels of its banking operations - both the branch
network and telephone banking channel - and HDI will, in turn, offer
its private clients the banking products and services of Citibank.
"HDI's 1.8 million private insurance customers will provide us with
very good cross-selling business,", Mindermann said.

Citi Leben, whose product range covers individual, whole life and risk
insurance, had total sum insured by end-November 1995 of DM16.7
billion, up 4 percent on 1994. HDI notched up consolidated premium
income totalling DM8 billion in 1994 and a net profit of DM134 million.

This kind of co-operative agreement will be important for Citibank in
Europe in promoting its concept of a "multi- finance service in banking
operations", Mindermann said. In linking up with HDI, Citibank is
continuing along the path already taken in offering home financing
(together with Rheinboden), home savings agreements (with mh) and
health insurance (with Barmenia) in order to optimise its own financial
services business by exploiting "intercorporate alliances".

The most recent European market Citibank has targeted with its consumer
services is the UK. During 1995, it opened five branches, all following
the same strategy as elsewhere on the globe.

"We simply rolled out what's been happening in Germany, France and
Spain," said Mike Dennehy, consumer banking and marketing director for
the UK. "The UK is such a mature and sophisticated market that we had
to be sure we got the formula exactly right before starting a consumer
operation."

Account structures differ around Europe but the UK has adopted various
features from other Citibank markets. For example, if a customer has a
balance of over #2,000 on all of his/her accounts, there is no banking
charge, a feature of the Belgian operation.

The UK has also taken on the Greek policy of instant credit card
issuance. Customers can receive a card on the spot, if they fulfil all
the requirements, simply by filling out a form.

The biggest obstacle to setting up a retail operation in the UK was the
fact that Citibank was so well known as a corporate bank, Dennehy said.
In the UK since 1902, Citibank now employs 3,000 people, 400 of which
are now in the consumer business. The bank has been offering mortgages
for 25 years. Dennehy stressed that Citibank in the UK is only after a
niche market - clients earning #30,000 ($46,418) and above with an
"international element to their lives".

"We're not looking for hundreds of thousands of customers, but tens of
thousands," he said."They could be someone who works in Belgium one
week out of four, or has a house in France, for instance."

CITIBANK TO PULL BACK IN FRANCE?

CITIBANK IS set to become the latest of a series of foreign banks to
reduce their presence in France. According to reports, Citibank's
French subsidiary is attempting to sell its small and medium-sized
enterprise portfolio and its small branch network in the provinces in
order to concentrate on its consumer banking business in the Paris
area. Among the possible candidates set to take over this portfolio is
the Banques Populaires group.

The rumours, on which Citibank would not comment, come hard on the
heels of news that prestigious names such as Banca Commerciale Italiana
(Comit), Barclays Bank, La Caixa and American Express are all in the
process of lowering their retail banking ambitions in France.

Comit, for example, is thought to be discussing the sale of part of its
19-branch network (most of which is on the Cote d'Azur, apart from five
branches in Paris) to Banques Populaires. The Italian bank lost Fr495.8
million ($100 million) in France in the period 1992-1994, mostly
because of its involvement in speculative property loans.

Less prominent names such as Banco di Napoli, ASLK-CGER Bank of Belgium
and the Banque Franco-Portugaise have also announced lay- offs and
decisions to refocus their businesses.

The news also comes shortly after the release of figures by the
Association Francaise des Banques which suggest that the chances of
survival of small niche-based retail banks (many of which are owned by
non-French institutions) are extremely slim. These suggest that net
banking income and operating profits have continued to fall steadily
through the first half of 1995.

As foreign banks in France generally lack the critical mass to
withstand this downward pressure and increasing competition, their
attempts to carve out a branch-based business have been frustrated.
