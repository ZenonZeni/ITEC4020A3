<P>
Large areas of Sweden are covered by forests of high commercial
value. Forests are also important for environmental aspects, i.e.
to determine clear cuts. Remote sensing offers possibilities of
regular surveys but due to the cloud cover microwaves are important
to use as a complement to optical sensors. 
<P>
The group has been involved in analyzing the possibilities for
bole volume (biomass) determination by using polarimetric data
from the JPL AirSAR, intensity and interferometric data from ERS-1
and intensity data from JERS-1. Investigations using the low frequency
airborne CARABAS system developed by the National Defense Research
Establishment are also ongoing.
<P>
Images have been provided from Ottenbylund, &Ouml;land, and from
Maine, USA. Field investigation have taken place at Ottenbylund
and it has been shown that the sensitivity for stem volume has
not saturated like higher frequency SAR systems for the observed
stem volume (up to 210 m<SUP>3</SUP>/ha). 
<P>
A <A HREF="WWW_CAR.htm" >program </A>for developing models for
the radar scattering is ongoing. Compared to models developed
at higher frequencies it is important to investigate what forest
properties dominate the scattering, to what extent coherent interactions
take place and to what extent ground penetration takes place.
<P>
Presently the main forestry projects in the group are related
to ERS and JERS <A HREF="insar.htm">interferometry </A>and to
