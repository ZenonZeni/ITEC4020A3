K-III Holdings Agrees To Acquire Field Publications

K-III Holdings (NY) has signed a definitive agreement with Field
Corp. (Chicago) to acquire the assets of Field Publications and
Funk & Wagnalls for an undisclosed amount. Field Corp. had put
Field Publications on the block in July and recently confirmed that
it was involved in talks with K-III on sale of the company (EM,
Dec. 10, `90). Its investment banker for the transaction is Morgan
Stanley.

The sale, which is expected to be completed early this year, involves
Field's classroom periodicals, including Weekly Reader; book clubs;
supplementary materials for children; and its Funk & Wagnalls
encyclopedia and educational materials publishing unit, acquired in
mid-1988 (EM, June 6, `88). These businesses, which employ about 950
people, have estimated combined sales of more than $300 million. With
the acquisition, K-III, a publishing-oriented investment partnership,
will operate seven publishing and information businesses with 2000
employees and post yearly sales of about $500 million.

According to William F. Reilly, chairman and CEO of K-III, the
acquisition provides a strategic fit with K-III's educational unit,
Newbridge Communications, a direct marketing company specializing
in books clubs and continuity programs for teachers and children.
Newbridge markets to more than 400,000 teachers, and Field's Weekly
Reader and ancillary publications go to more than 8.5 million
elementary students and 700,000 teachers. Field's book clubs and
continuity programs serve the children's book market through the
mail, and F&W publishes a children's encyclopedia marketed through
mass-market supermarket distribution. In terms of product and
management, no major changes are anticipated. Field Publications is
based in Middletown, CT.

Commerce Department Puts Textbook Sales At $4.06 Billion

Shipments of textbooks totalled $4.06 billion in 1990, with sales
almost evenly split between el-hi and college sales, according to
estimates prepared by the U.S. Commerce Department for its annual
publication U.S. Industrial Outlook 1991. For the entire publishing
industry, The Outlook showed shipments totalling $14.5 billion in
1990, a 6.7% increase over 1989. When adjusted for inflation, the
Commerce Department data showed shipments up 2.5% in the year.
A slowing economy which featured minimal growth in personal
consumption expenditures was cited as a leading reason for the
modest sales growth in the year, which fell below Commerce
Department estimates of real growth of 3.6%. Restrained school and
library funding were also named as reasons for the lower than
expected growth.

The Commerce Department also estimated that publishers' profits
were hurt in 1990. While publishers achieved limited economies
through improvements in manufacturing and distribution operations,
these savings were reduced by higher editorial, marketing and
administrative costs, the report said.

Despite a soft economy, the Commerce Department's outlook for 1991
sees publishers benefitting from a more coherent funding pattern
for textbooks, nominal gains in disposable income and from
continued demand for books in the international marketplace. On the
negative side, postal rate increases and higher costs for paper
will put pressure on margins. Commerce sees rising school
enrollment and gains in education funding pushing U.S. book
industry sales to $17.3 billion this year, an increase--adjusted
for price increases--of about 3% from 1990.

For the longer term, Commerce forecasts real growth of about 3.5%.
Growth will be accompanied by moderate cost increases as paper
mills and book printers become more efficient in the manufacture
and printability of recycled and acid-free paper. El-hi enrollments
are projected to rise by 3 million students in the 1990-95 period,
while 10.2 million people are expected to move into the high
income, heavy reading segment, aged 35 to 54 during this span.

Education Publishing Stocks Drop 26.2% In 1990

Stock prices of education publishers fell by 26.2% last year,
compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which declined by
4.4%, according to a round-up of publicly held companies. All
publishers posted declines, and those of all but one, McGraw-Hill,
showed declines in the double-digit category. M-H's stock price
dropped by 7.3% to 52 5/8, compared with 56 3/4 at the end of 1989.

Hardest hit was Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, down by 80.2% to 15/16
from 4 3/4 a year ago. Wall Street is evidently not convinced that
the beleagured company will successfully complete a turnaround. It
was followed by John Wiley, which recorded a drop of 43.4% to 30,
compared with 53 at the end of 1989. Investor Theodore Cross'
recent low key stance regarding Wiley has dampened speculation that
Wiley may soon be put in play.

Waverly similarly recorded a hefty drop of 30% to 17 1/4 from 24
1/2 at the close of 1989, also a victim of diminished speculation.
Following in descending order are Times Mirror, down 25.2% from 35
3/4 to 26 3/4 at the end of 1990; Plenum, down 20.2% from 28 1/2 to
22 3/4; Houghton Mifflin, down 19.8% from 38 7/8 to 24 3/4; and
Paramount, down 19% from 50 1/2 to 40 7/8.

Houghton Mifflin Hopes For Better Growth in `91

Acknowledging that it has failed to achieve its minimum financial
goals of 10% compounded growth in sales and net income for the past
few years--including 1990--Houghton Mifflin said it is hopeful it
will reach that target in 1991. Results in 1990 were hurt by a 20%
increase in developmental costs as well as lower than expected
college revenues.

Speaking at PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference, HM
chief financial officer Stephen Jaeger said both HM's trade &
reference division and school division are expected to show strong
growth in 1991. The school division in particular is expected to
benefit from a host of new developments undertaken in 1990,
including the development of an elementary social studies program
that will be introduced this year. El-hi social studies is a new
segment for HM.

Company margins should benefit from more modest increases in
developmental costs, Jaeger said. Improvements in technology have
been a two-edged sword when it comes to margins, he reported. While
technology has improved publishing efficiency, it has also placed
pressure on marketing and selling costs by causing schools to
expect lots of extras when selling texts.

HM chairman Nader Darehshori also touched on the ancillary
materials issue, observing that the biggest change in marketing he
has seen over the years is the amount of freebies schools have come
to expect. He claimed that HM has one of the smallest
implementation packages in the industry and said the company has no
plans to expand that kit. He added that some competitors could
become so desperate for short term gains that they might increase
the size of the incentive package.

Darehshori also said that HM will continue to increase its
attention on the high school market in order to meet rising
enrollments. During 1990, HM introduced a new English program for
grades 9-12 as well as new editions of its math program. A new
American history textbook is also set for this year.

Adoption opportunities for reading this year are expected to be
broader, and H-M has just started intoducing a new 1991 reading
program called Houghton Mifflin Reading: The Literature Experience,
Dareshori said. He noted that early responses from the market have
been positive, with the program already having been adopted in
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico and Oklahoma.

No Fire Sale At Maxwell Communication Corp.

Though its debt still stands at 1.7 billion pounds, Maxwell Communication
Corp.s' joint managing director Kevin Maxwell told analysts at
PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference that MCC is not in
a fire sale position and will not sell any more operations unless
it can get a full and fair price.

MCC executives sought to put distance between their company and
advertising-dependent companies that have been battered by a slump
in advertising by noting that only 10% of its business relies on
advertising revenue. MCC's businesses also do not rely on the
economic fortune of one nation, executives said. Although about 80%
of MCC's business is headquartered in the U.S., more than 30% of
revenue from those businesses are derived from offshore.
MCC was more forthcoming than McGraw-Hill about its hopes for
taking take its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. public,
saying it hopes to take the venture public by the third quarter of
1991 subject to market conditions. In an earlier presentation, M-H
chairman Joseph Dionne was vague about prospects for taking the
school publisher public. According to the agreement, however,
either party can offer all or some of their own shares in an
offering. MCC seems more eager to take the publisher public than
M-H.

Minority offerings in other MCC companies such as OAG and Pergamon
Press will not be considered until after the offering for M-M-H,
Maxwell said. Those sales will also depend on market conditions.
Maxwell also indicated that all sales would not be solely to raise
money. The recent sale of 20% of Berlitz to a Japanese private
education company to form Berlitz Japan (EM, Nov. 19 `90) helps the
company to tap Japanese students to buy our products, Maxwell said.
Berlitz provides language instruction and translation services.

New M-M-H Activity Series

The Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. has released two
new series of activity books aimed at boosting parental involvement
in elementary mathematics and science education. The two series are
called Helping Your Child At Home . . . With Mathematics and
Helping Your Child At Home . . . With Science, and consist of
activity books for each grade level in K-8 in mathematics and K-6
in science. The books present no-cost activities that can be done
at home to reinforce concepts learned at school and they are
correlated with M-M-H's basal elementary and science textbooks.

William Talkington, vice president of the M-M-H's School Division,
told EM that the two series are being sold directly to schools at
a price of $4.95 per volume-in-the-series. The company is also
offering a single-copy purchase price of $7.95. No plans are being
entertained to sell the series to the retail market, he told EM,
noting that the company is more intent on working with schools and
parents.

Books Strongest Performer For Times Mirror

The short term outlook for Times Mirror is not encouraging,
chairman Robert Erburu told attendees at the recent Outlook for the
Media Conference, adding, however, that he was still optimistic
about long term prospects. Book publishing and cable operations
have been the company's strongest performers in the year, he said.
As part of efforts to cut costs in the year, TM plans in 1991 to
reduce capital spending to less than $300 million and has set
stringent limits on acquisitions.

In the company's professional publishing group, Erburu said that
Matthew Bender and Jeppensen Sanderson finish 1990 with
double-digit gains in both revenues and operating profits. Bender's
18-volume Bender's Federal Tax Service has had strong growth in the
year. Richard D. Irwin was also expected to have finished the year
with double-digit revenue increases led by its basic accounting
texts. Mosby-Year Book and CRC Press are also having record years
with improved margins.

The professional publishing group expects to post total revenues in
1990 of about $750 million, an increase of about 15%, he said. The
outlook for this year is positive, with new introductions
supplementing selective price increases.

Professional publishing revenues for the first three quarters of
1990 were $541.6 million, up from $460.3 million in the like 1989
period. Consumer publishing posted revenues of $227.1 million, up
slightly from $224 million in the earlier period.

Banta Committed To Book Printing

Although commercial printing has overtaken book printing as the
largest segment for Banta Corp., the company remains committed to
both the general and education book markets, executives said at
PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference. Both chairman
Calvin Aurand and senior vice president Gerry Henseler reported
that books remain a significant contributor to Banta, and have
solid margins. In addition, Aurand told the analysts that Banta
would consider making an acquisition primarily in two
areas--hardcover books and soft cover manuals.

Banta's commitment notwithstanding, Aurand said growth in the
production of paperback books for education should be slower in
1991 than in `90. Aurand was hopeful, however, that business in the
general book area would remain strong and he was particularly
optimistic about the prospect for soft cover manuals. The growth of
the computer industry continues to feed the growth of the computer
manuals business, Aurand noted.

Aurand and Henseler were optimistic that Banta will hit its
targeted goals of a 9% growth in revenues and a 13% increase in
profits in 1990. Aurand said Banta was cautiously optimistic about
1991, noting that he is confident revenues will be there, but added
that margins are a concern.

The executives also said that the negotiations for the sale of
Banta Ventures, Banta's video production unit, are continuing with
the management of that operation. Banta said in October it was
planning to divest itself of the video segment to focus on its core
businesses of printing and graphics, a sentiment Aurand reiterated.
And while Aurand acknowledged this is not the easiest time for
management to get money, he said he was still confident a deal with
Banta Ventures management will be completed.

Scholastic's U.K. Unit To Acquire Deutsch Children's Books

Scholastic Inc.'s U.K. subsidiary, Scholastic Publications Ltd.,
has entered an agreement to acquire Andre Deutsch Children's Books,
the children's hardcover publishing unit of Andre Deutsch Ltd. The
acquisition is expected to be completed early in the new year.

The Deutsch unit, with estimated sales of about 1.3 million pounds,
publishes about 50 titles a year, including trade hardcovers and
paperbacks, and has a backlist of more than 500 titles. Acquiring
it will afford Scholastic a rapid expansion of its publishing
program. It would have taken us five years to build up Scholastic's
hardcover list, and this acquisition allows us to get there
immediately, said David Kewley, managing director. The acquisition
will significantly enable us to expand our hardcover and paperback
publishing from the substantial base of the Deutsch hardcover list
and our own Hippo paperback list.

Deutsch staff will join Scholastic on completion of the
acquisition, and its sales force and Gollancz, its distributor,
will continue to sell and distribute the children's list until
mid-year. At that time, Scholastic will move to new offices in
central London that will house all children's book publishing
staff, and its Hippo sales force will take over the Deutsch list.

Scholastic's Instructor Marks Its Centennial

celebrating 100 years of publishing with a special centennial issue
this month that provides a retrospective of 100 years of teaching
and chronicles landmark events in education during that period. The

Harcourt Brace World acquired it in 1968, and it was sold to Edgell
Communications in 1987 and acquired by Scholastic in mid-1989 (EM,
July 3, `89).

Separately, Scholastic has named David F. Rodriguez to the new post
of national sales director for the education marketing group. He
was formerly education marketing representative, a position being
filled by Nancy A. Farrell, previously account manager with The Ivy
League Network. Rodriguez will be responsible for developing sales
strategy, overseeing sales staff and new business development for
sponsored educational programs. Farrell will oversee development of
sponsored educational programs in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast
regions.
