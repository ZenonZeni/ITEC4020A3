Calif. operators push environmental plan

     Western States Petroleum Assn. has unveiled a
blueprint for California's Kern County that may enable
oil and gas producers, environmentalists, endangered
plants and animals, and county, state and federal
government officials to co-exist peacefully and
beneficially.
     The specifics of the plan are contained in a WSPA
"white paper" designed to be consistent with the
protection of endangered species outlined in a 1989
memorandum of understanding among Kern County,
the California Fish & Game Dept.'s oil, gas and
geothermal division and the federal Fish & Wildlife
Service and Bureau of Land Management.
     "It's a great first step," said WSPA's Mike
Emanuel, of the white paper's chances of leading
toward an agreement among the parties involved.
     Other principles guiding development of the paper
included meeting requirements of the federal and
California endangered species acts while allowing for
economic growth and development in Kern County;
providing a reliable process for landowners to
compensate for or mitigate impacts on sensitive
species; and distributing the conservation burden
broadly and fairly among public and private
landowners, based on the impact of their activities on
sensitive species.
     A look at the makeup of Kern County's
environment makes clear the need for some kind of
coordinating plan. Oil fields in the county account for
about 592,000 b/d, or two out of every three barrels
produced in California. Kern County blankets the
southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, which was
recently described in a guide book as follows: "No
national park, no recreation area, no wildlife refuge
anywhere in the contiguous 48 states has a wider
variety of rare and endangered birds, animals and plant
life than can be found in the southern San Joaquin
Valley."
     WSPA's paper calls for providing incentives for
preservation and development to occur in patterns that
preserve large, connected blocks of highly valued
habitat. The plan would divide the valley floor into four
zones, including three for which compensation for
development would be required and a fourth in which
no compensation would be required because of the
absence of valuable habitat.
     The latter area, a "gray zone," represents heavily
disturbed areas that do not fit into the overall
conservation strategy, such as oil fields with well
spacing of four acres or less.
     Compensation for other zones would be based on a
ratio no greater than 3-to-1, which would be used to
calculate the level of compensation required.
Compensation for development within the three zones
would be in the form of credits generated by the
permanent preservation of habitat, granting of
conservation easements or other specified measures.
     Red, green and white zones would be used to
determine the habitat value of any parcel within the
plan area in terms of habitat units (h.u.).
     Three habitat units per acre would be offered for a
red zone, the lands of highest value for conservation
purposes; two units for a green zone, land less
important than a red zone but still valuable for
conservation purposes, particularly to provide
connectivity across the reserve system; and one habitat
unit for a white zone, covering a large area with widely
varying, but typically low, biological values that could
not contribute significantly to long-term conservation
strategy.
     White zone lands generally would not be available
for compensation.
     A formula would be adopted for adjusting habitat
unit values based on consideration of connectivity with
other habitat. Landowners would receive transferable
habitat unit credits for granting land for preservation
purposes or taking other specified conservation
actions.
     A monitoring plan would be established, creating
the ability to adjust the valley floor habitat conservation
plan over time as necessary to meet conservation
goals.
     Landowners who preserve habitat would receive
credits based on the habitat unit value of the land
preserved, and owners who disturb habitat would
compensate based on the habitat unit value of the area
disturbed at the compensation ratio.
     If the ratio is 3-to-1, compensation for taking in
each of the three zones would be as follows:

     ** Red zone (worth 3 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 9 h.u./acre of impact, which could be done with
either 3 acres in the red zone or 4.5 acres in the green
zone.
     ** Green zone (worth 2 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 6 h.u./acre of impact, which could be either 2
acres in the red zone or 3 acres in the green zone.
     ** White zone (worth 1 h.u./acre) -- Compensate
with 3 h.u./acre of impact, which could be done with
either 1 acre in the red zone or 1.5 acres in the green
zone.

     While the approach doesn't place an absolute cap on
development in any one zone, it effectively would cap
the total loss of habitat value at 25%, because at a 3-to-
1 compensation ratio, 75% of the habitat value would
be protected from development.
     The approach based on habitat value would provide
a more meaningful conservation than one based on
acreage, according to WSPA, because the habitat value
measure provides strong incentives to compensate in
large, connected areas of highly valued habitat, as well
as strong disincentives to disturb those areas.
     The plan also recognizes habitat that is restored to
an established standard. If an oil field is restored to the
established standard after abandonment, thereby
undoing a habitat disturbance for which habitat credits
were previously provided as compensation, the
landowner could reuse those credits.
     Among conservation advantages claimed for the
approach are providing incentives that will result in a
very high percentage of habitat preserved in the most
sensitive areas, strong positive incentives to restore
land to native habitat after it has been put to a
temporary industrial use such as oil operations, and
strong incentives for habitat to be preserved in large,
connected configurations.
     Among economic advantages claimed for the plan
are providing both large and small landowners a timely
and predictable means of obtaining value for high-
value habitat on their property; a timely, predictable
and flexible means of compensating for habitat loss
with minimal costly survey requirements; a certain
equity among landowners with lands of different
habitat quality; and ways for landowners to minimize
their compensation requirements over time by doing a
good job of cleaning up after themselves by restoring
land to native habitat.

Enviros face united front in badlands battle

     An unlikely coalition of oil and gas producers,
ranchers, business people, politicians, and Indians have
joined forces in North Dakota to oppose a plan to turn
a huge chunk of the state's western badlands into a
wilderness preserve.
     At issue is a proposal by wildlife and
environmental groups spearheaded by the Sierra Club
that Congress declare 191,000 acres in the state as a
wilderness area. Eighty-two percent of that lies in the
Little Missouri National Grasslands area of the
badlands. The remaining acreage is in the Sheyenne
Grasslands near Lisbon, N.D., and the J. Clark Salyer
National Wildlife Refuge in McHenry and Bottineau
counties.
     The proposal, detailed in the environmental groups'
publication "Badlands on the Brink," would allow
hunting, hiking, camping and livestock grazing, but
would ban further oil and gas development. Motorized
vehicles would be banned except for ranchers making
repairs and improvements.
     More than 100 opponents of the plan got together
last week in Dickinson, N.D., to talk strategy. They are
worried that strict preservation will damage oil and
cattle businesses and eventually doom Dickinson and
other, smaller towns in that part of the state.
     The proposal was dealt a blow at the meeting when
the Three Affiliated Tribes, a Native American group
listed by the Sierra Club as a sponsor of the plan,
withdrew its support and said it will cancel its Sierra
Club membership.
     "It's going to take a lot of the economic
development away from the tribe, and oil development
and cattle ranching," said tribal Vice Chairman Ivan
Johnson. He said the tribe didn't know it was listed as
a sponsor for the wilderness proposal until tribal
officials started fielding calls from area ranchers.
     County, city and school boards in the western
section of North Dakota depend on taxes from oil and
gas revenues to fund their budgets. Five counties
would be affected by the wilderness plan. For the state,
oil tax revenues made up 10% of the 1989-91 general
fund budget.
     Mike Armstrong of Dickinson, an independent oil
producer, said at the meeting it's natural for oil and gas
operators and ranchers to join forces. "We need to
protect the resources they're trying to take from our
state. All this land is open to public use now, except
the private land."
     Those at the meeting decided to start a letter-writing
campaign to the state's congressional delegation and
advocated "arm twisting" North Dakota Gov. Ed
Schafer to join their cause.
     The group -- which still needs a name -- will form a
working association of ranchers, oil and gas producers,
businesses and government officials. They plan to
compile resolutions from groups opposed to the plan,
gather economic impact statistics and print a brochure
defending badlands development.
     Alice Benitiz, lands director for the Rocky
Mountain Oil & Gas Assn., attended the meeting and
told E&PE the Sierra Club's push to have the
grasslands designated as a wilderness area smacked of
"sour grapes."
     Benitiz said, "The badlands and other areas of
North Dakota have been studied for almost 20 years
by the U.S. Forest Service to determine their suitability
as wilderness areas." And each time, she said, the
agency had decided the region could not be managed
as wilderness because of the level of development and
importance of oil and gas production and ranching to
surrounding communities.
     "The environmental groups have failed through the
very public process in which they were involved to get
the Forest Service to halt oil and gas activity," she said.
"And this mechanism [legislation] is the only way they
have left."

NRC touts 'super' environmental agency

     The National Research Council has proposed in a
report due out later this summer that the U.S. make
sweeping and fundamental changes in the way it
handles environmental problems.
     Entitled Research to Protect, Restore and Manage
the Environment, the 241-page study takes dead aim at
the way the federal government conducts
environmental research. Existing programs are poorly
structured, uncoordinated and hampered by the lack of
clear leadership at the highest levels of government, the
NRC report said.
     NRC recommended establishment of a national
environmental council, chaired by the vice president,
composed of the heads of the federal environmental
agencies, and aided by advisory committees made up
of representatives from the scientific community, the
public, state government, and the private sector.
     The council would provide leadership and
coordination among federal agencies for environmental
research and oversee implementation of a national plan
to identify a research agenda and the responsibilities of
individual agencies.
     NRC also proposed the creation of an
environmental assessment center to convey policy
options to the national environmental council,
Congress and the involved parties. If the U.S. is to
make major improvements in the quality of its
environmental research and policy programs, NRC
said EPA has to be elevated to cabinet status with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin., the U.S.
Geological Survey and parts of NASA becoming part
of a Dept. of the Environment.
     Washington distributes about $5 billion annually to
more than 20 federal agencies for environmental
research. But, NRC points out, there "is no
comprehensive national environmental research plan to
coordinate the efforts" of the agencies.
     "Moreover, no agency has the mission to develop
such a plan, nor is any existing agency able to
coordinate and oversee a national environmental
research plan if one were designed," the report adds.
     Science and engineering "have the tools to address
environmental problems of enormous consequence to
our social and economic well being," the study said.
"But we aren't using those tools most effectively."
     Bridges between policy, management and science
are weak, the report said. And there is no organized
system to communicate assessments of environmental
problems to decision-makers and policy-setters.
     To order a copy of the report, contact the National
Academy Press at 800-624-6242.

Emissions-control process patented

     Radian Corp. and the Gas Research Institute have
completed work on an emissions-control process for
triethylene glycol dehydrators that maximizes
emissions recovery while retaining hydrocarbons for
resale.
     The process, know as Recovery-BTEX, or R- BTEX,
was developed by Radian as part of research on glycol
dehydrators sponsored by GRI. Radian's Phil Lowell
recently patented the process (U.S. Patent No.
5,209,762); the patent rights have been assigned to GRI.
     R-BTEX addresses the issue that all natural gas,
whether it's produced directly from the source
formation or from a storage reservoir, contains some
water that must be removed to prevent hydrate
formation and minimize corrosion during
transmission. Glycol dehydrators remove water from
the gas stream, but in the process also remove some
volatile organic compounds (VOCs); among them are
benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene, collectively
known as BTEX.
     When glycol is regenerated, absorbed water is
boiled off along with the volatile hydrocarbons,
including BTEX, and released into the atmosphere.
     In 1989, Louisiana's Environmental Quality Dept.
spearheaded an effort to quantify the amount of BTEX
and other VOCs released from glycol dehydrators. The
department surveyed more than 200 glycol
dehydrators processing at least 5 mmcf/day of natural
gas that were operated by producing, processing,
pipeline and storage companies.
     The study found that levels of BTEX and other
VOCs from glycol units were high enough to be a
concern for the industry. There are an estimated 30,000
glycol dehydrators in use in the U.S. The Clean Air
Act has potentially wide-ranging consequences for
glycol units because BTEX are included in the list of
189 air toxic pollutants and may be emitted at levels
that would cause many glycol units to be defined as
major sources.
     If so, the units would be required to use and
comply with the maximum achievable control
technology (MACT) standards. And while MACT
technologies are considered state-of-the-art and
efficient, industry contends they are not necessarily
designed to be cost-effective.
     Radian's process is based on the established
technologies of stripping, condensation and phase
separation. GRI says R-BTEX provides a cost-
effective alternative for controlling BTEX emissions.
R-BTEX is designed for new or retrofit applications.
     Since the water recovered from the gas is used as
the coolant, the process operates at condenser
temperatures below those reached using air cooling.
And in most cases, that makes possible a 95%
recovery of hydrocarbons as saleable liquids. R-BTEX
can control BTEX emissions by as much as 99.9% if
vented BTEX is controlled at the condenser vent and
flash tank.
     Researchers said the blowdown water from the R-
BTEX cooling tower has a very low concentration of
dissolved organics and can sometimes be directly
discharged without further treatment.
     Two tests were conducted last year using two gas-
processing scenarios to evaluate the effect of gas
pressure, BTEX concentration, glycol recirculation
rate, and reboiler temperature on process performance.
For each test, the production rate was 75 mcf/day of
gas.
     One test was conducted in a high-pressure field of
900 psi with gas containing 750 ppm BTEX. The
other was carried out in a lower pressure field of 400
psi with gas containing 300 BTEX.
     In the first case, researchers recovered 9.2 b/d of
BTEX with emissions of 0.78 lbs/day. In the second
test, 7.4 b/d were removed with emissions of 0.63
lbs/day of BTEX.

Indiana considers bird netting rules

     The Indiana Natural Resources Dept. is drawing up
regulations for mandatory covers on drilling and
production reserve pits.
     Sparking the movement is an incident that occurred
this spring north of Princeton, Ind., in Gibson County.
Two wood ducks were pulled from a pit by officials
from the department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. The ducks later died.
     Their deaths spurred a criminal inquiry and received
widespread publicity in the Illinois Basin. The incident
was also discussed at last month's meeting of the
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America in
Washington.
     Migratory birds and other wildlife are protected by
federal laws under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and
the Endangered Species Act. But Jim Slutz, head of
the department's Oil and Gas Division, said it is often
up to the individual state to enforce the oil industry's
compliance with regulations.
     He promised strong action in this and other reserve
pit events in Indiana, including steep fines and civil and
criminal charges. Federal violations also carry stiff
penalties and fines.
     To date, oilfield operations in the Midwest and
Appalachian states have dodged the bird netting
controversy. But state legislation requiring netting on
reserve pits is also being considered in Illinois and
Kentucky, said Craig Howard, president of the
Independent Oil Producers Assn., Tri-State.
     "A lot of attention is being given to the Endangered
Species Act and the necessity to prevent entry into
pits," he said. "It has become a serious issue, even
though the Gibson county incident is the only one to
receive publicity during the past 40 years."
     Department officials have begun to inspect more
reserve pits around the state, looking for violations.
Howard said some Illinois Basin producers have
begun to install bird netting, or are using storage tanks
to recycle drilling fluids or hold produced water to be
in compliance with federal laws or any state laws that
may be forthcoming.

ERCB calls for drilling waste management

     Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
has directed provincial oil and gas operators to submit
a waste disposal plan with well license applications
when hydrocarbon- or salt-based mud will be used or
produced during drilling.
     Re-entry situations that use an oil- or salt-base
drilling fluid system but don't need a well license
application require a waste disposal plan. Producers
will also have to retain the plan in their files because it
will be needed when they apply for a reclamation
certificate afterward.
     The plan must indicate the type of hydrocarbon or
salt used in the mud, estimated volume of drilling
waste to be generated, any additives, additional
treatment processes used such as incineration or reuse,
equipment used to reduce soil contamination and waste
volume and method of handling completion fluids.
     If an operator intends to use landfarming to dispose
of waste, the plan must provide a location and general
description of the site indicating:

     ** Estimated oil content is resulting soil mix (if oil-
        based).
     ** Present land use, topography, vegetation type,
        soil horizon used for disposal, topsoil depth, and size
        of disposal area.
     ** Measures used to contain surface and subsurface
        migration of contaminants.
     ** Procedures, timing and frequency of the
        landfarming operation and depth of initial
        incorporation into the soil.
     ** Schedule for any waste-soil mixture cultivation
        or tilling.
     ** Type of soil amendments which may be used to
        promote biodegradation.
     ** Analytical tests and sampling locations which
        will be used to determine initial soil-waste quality, and
        to monitor hydrocarbon degradation and salt levels.
     ** Time required to complete the landfarming
        procedure and the criteria used to determine when
        completion reached.
     ** Proximity to residents other than the landowner.
     ** Name and telephone number of person
        responsible for the disposal operation.

     If the well is to be located on public land, the waste
disposal plan will be reviewed by either the Agriculture
Dept.; Food, and Rural Development; or the
Environmental Protection Dept. The plan for wells
drilled on private land will be reviewed by ERCB's
Environment Protection Dept. The plan must be
approved before the operator can spud the well.
     According to ERCB, the purpose of the plan is to
make sure the operator "has considered the long-term
soil reclamation steps required when producing a
particular waste type," and to determine where and
how these treatments are being used in the province.

DOE seeks input to production strategy

     The Energy Dept. is asking for input from oil and
gas producers as it prepares a domestic oil and gas
initiative to create jobs and increase domestic
production while protecting the environment.
     Speaking at a recent oil and gas waste management
seminar sponsored by the Independent Oil & Gas
Assn. of Pennsylvania, Nancy Johnson, a DOE
program manager for environmental research and
analysis, urged operators to comment on the initiative.
     DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary announced the
project in April; the agency hopes to complete its draft
strategy for submission to President Clinton by Labor
Day.
     Johnson acknowledged oil and gas operators face
increasing environmental costs and liabilities
stemming from a constant flow of new and more
complex regulations. She stressed the importance of
basing policy analysis on cumulative regulatory
impact.
     For example, a DOE study determined the
industrial waste provisions proposed in a Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act bill last year would
have resulted in a 9% decrease in oil reserves, a 3%
decrease in gas reserves, the loss of 13,000 exploration
and production jobs, a $27 billion decrease in federal
and state tax revenues and would cost industry $40
billion initially plus $5 billion annually for compliance.
     Johnson said DOE wants to hear from industry
what it considers priority concerns, regional issues,
research needs, and innovative ideas for problem
solving through federal, state and industry co-
operation.
     Meanwhile, about three-quarters of DOE's
requested $101 million for natural gas programs is
aimed at utilizing fuel cells ($50 million), advanced
turbines ($24 million) and other uses ($5 million).
Also proposed is some $17 million for resource and
extraction programs, $3.4 million for delivery and
storage, and $2.9 million for environmental research
and analysis.
     The proposed $80 million petroleum budget targets
$70 million for oil recovery programs and $3.6 million
for environmental research and analysis.
     Comments for the domestic oil and gas strategy
should be directed to Len Coburn, Office of Oil and
Natural Gas Policy (EP-52); or Donald Juckett, Office
of Fossil Energy (FE-30), Dept. of Energy, 1000
Independence Ave. SW, Washington, D.C. 20585.

Twenty-five operators fined $130,800

     The Texas Railroad Commission racked up another
$130,800 in fines over the last two weeks as it charged
25 oil and gas operators with violations of commission
well plugging and pollution rules.
     So far in 1993, the commission has levied
$1,312,401.32 in fines, compared to only $543,666 in
such penalties assessed during the same period last
year.

SVE leads in EPA market survey

     An EPA report coming out soon projects the
volume of contaminated soil amenable to soil vapor
extraction at 2 1/2 times the amount that could be
subjected to in situ bioremediation.
     Soil vapor extraction has been used in 17% of
cleanup treatment remedies applied so far but is still
considered innovative because information on meeting
cleanup targets is hard to get. It's a lot easier to track
what's been removed than what's left behind.
     So said Walter Kovalick, head of EPA's 4-year-old
Technology Innovation Office in Superfund and an
acting deputy administrator for solid waste and
emergency response. He described the new report last
week at a conference in St. Paul, Minn. The report, 2
1/2 years in the making, projects market share in
volumes of soil to be treated by various innovative
technologies during the next five to eight years.
     For example, the soil vacuum extraction (SVE)
market was put at 3.2 million cubic yards, in situ
bioremediation at 1.2 million cubic yards, in situ soil
flushing at 980,000 cubic yards, and soil washing at
840,000 cubic yards. Kovalick said bioremediation has
been lagging, while soil flushing and soil washing
have been moving up.
     The market survey focuses on 550 sites at the
remedial design stage and 738 that are going through
the remedial investigation and feasibility study process.
     Contamination volumes were aggregated from sites
in various cleanup programs: Superfund, 1,600 to
2,000 sites (including 400 to 800 in the discovery or
listing part of the process); RCRA corrective action,
3,500; underground storage tanks, 295,000; Defense
Dept., 7,313; Energy Dept., 4,000; other federal
agencies, 350.
     Although no information was available on the
number of state sites, Kovalick said states had spent
$428 million and have cleanup fund balances of $2.2
billion.
accounted for 61% of thermal treatments.
     The report, Cleaning Up the Nation's Waste Sites:
Markets and Technical Trends, No. PB93-140762, will
be available from the National Technical Information
Service, 703-487-4650. T

OSPRA audits on schedule

     The Texas General Land Office says it has
completed about half its audits of coastal facilities that
have submitted oil spill contingency plans required by
the state's 1991 Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act
(OSPRA).
     GLO began the series of random audits in January
and to date its 22 inspectors have examined some 300
of the 600 oil-handling facilities scattered along the
Texas coastline from Louisiana to Mexico, including
production sites.
     Timothy McKinna, who is in charge of the land
office's spill division, said the random audits will likely
be completed by the end of August. He told E&PE
about 100 facilities have passed inspection and been
certified by the agency; the remainder are in the
process of making changes to their plans to bring them
into line.
     McKinna said companies' compliance with the
requirements of OSPRA has improved as the audits
have progressed. "When we began random on-site
audits in January, we discovered a variety of problems
that made plans that looked good on paper unworkable
in reality," he said. "Some of the plans were so
cumbersome that personnel would never have the
inclination to study them, much less understand them."
     If an operator doesn't have a workable contingency
plan in place, the way in which the land office conducts
the audits doesn't provide much opportunity to cobble
one together. GLO auditors normally give an operator
only about an hour's notice that they're coming to
conduct the inspection.

1992 saw record EPA fines

     The filing of criminal charges against
environmental polluters is the fastest growing
component of EPA's enforcement efforts, an agency
report says.
     EPA's just released Enforcement
Accomplishments Report for Fiscal Year 1992 says
the year saw record fines levied for both civil and
criminal environmental violations. The report credits
the growth of criminal enforcement to the new resident
agent offices opened in Houston, Los Angeles,
Buffalo, N.Y., St. Louis, and Miami.
     To order a copy of the report, call EPA's Public

Correction

     In the May 14 issue, E&PE incorrectly stated
Colorado surface owners were asking that the state Oil
and Gas Conservation Commission raise the surface
damage bond of Gerrity Oil & Gas Corp.       Instead,
the case involved wells being drilled by Elk
Exploration. Gerrity has no applications pending for a
surface damage bond increase before the commission.
     The case was heard in part at the commission's
April meeting and continued until its June hearing.
After more than 10 hours of hearings, the commission
recommended a bond in the amount of $15,250
(E&PE 6/11).
     Covering three wells, the per well bond amount is
$5,083, or $83 more than the standard $5,000 required
for a single well by the commission's rules.

Controversial well draws ire

     The comment period for a Bureau of Land
Management draft environmental impact statement
favorable to the drilling of a controversial proposed
exploratory well in South Florida has been extended 90
days to Aug. 18.
     Shell Oil wants to drill a 18,850-foot directional
wildcat on the Miccosukee Indian reservation under the
everglades in Broward County.
     The project has drawn the fire of environmentalists
and state and local officials because the Biscayne
aquifer, the region's main underground water supply,
begins within five miles of the proposed well. Shell
says the well will not affect the aquifer, but
environmentalists maintain it will.
     The Florida Legislature and South Florida Water
Management Board have passed resolutions calling on
both the BLM and Bureau of Indian Affairs, the two
federal agencies charged with reviewing and approving
the EIS, to kill the plan. In addition, Broward County
commissioners passed a resolution threatening a
lawsuit if the well is approved. If approved by both
agencies, the final EIS will probably be published next
February or March.
     Anticipation of a discovery of hydrocarbons by the
well is low. So far, only 14 of 202 exploratory wells in
South Florida have produced oil or gas, and the only
well drilled in Broward County was a duster.
     For a copy of the draft EIS, contact Robert Abbey,
District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, 411
Briarwood Dr., Suite 404, Jackson, Miss. 39206, or

Edwards signs oilfield bill

     Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards has signed into
law the Oilfield Restoration Act to clean up E&P sites
statewide.
     Heavily supported by oil and gas interests, the law
levies a fee of 1"/barrel on oil and a 0.2"/mcf of
natural gas produced in the state, with a $10/yr charge
for non-producing wells.
     Levied at the wellhead, the fees will be collected in
the same way as the state's severance tax, using
monthly producer payments. The money will go into
the Oilfield Site Restoration Trust Fund, and will
finance the reclamation of about 2,000 known
orphaned and abandoned sites in Louisiana.
Temporarily abandoned or saltwater disposal wells in
stripper fields are exempt.
     There is a $10 million ceiling and a $6 million floor
on the fund; it's expected to generate $4-5 million in its
first year. The fund will be administered by a
commission made up of the Natural Resources Dept.
secretary and six others who will be selected by Gov.
Edwards from industry and environmental
organizations.

Environmental patents

     M.M. Francis and T.R. Jack have patented a
process for biodegradation of oily waste in a passively
aerated bioreactor that contains a porous, substantially
oleophilic matrix, such as peat. The process may be
used to treat the types of oily wastes conventionally
disposed of in landfarming operations. The technique
provides the potential to reduce the loss of leachates
and to control the loss of volatiles (Canadian Patent
No. 2,032,610).
     F.D. Rowsell has patented a method for collecting
and recovering oil spills in water. The spills are treated
with amine-substituted water-swelling clays added to
the spill in amounts that herd oil into islands separated
by surfaces of water containing no oil. The clays can
also be added to oil spills in an amount that produces
quasi-solid, buoyant organoclay-oil flocculate clumps
that float in the water and can be collected from the
surface (U.S. Patent No. 5,176,831).
     J.B. Rodden of Shell Oil Co. has patented a system
for removal and disposal of minor amounts of
organics from contaminated water. The process uses a
pump to feed water from the body of contaminated
water to the system, where indirect heat exchange and
direct steam addition raises its temperature. A stripping
vessel uses gas to strip the heated water and remove
the volatile contaminants (U.S. Patent No. 5,176,798).

EPA to update regs

     EPA is proposing to update a portion of the outer
continental shelf air regulations for the OCS lying
offshore Southern California.
     Appearing in the June 18 issue of the Federal
Register (58 FR 33589), the notice says the portions of
the OCS air regs that are being updated relate to the
requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa
Barbara Air Pollution Control District, Ventura County
APCD and San Luis Obispo APCD are the
corresponding onshore areas. Deadline for comments
is July 19.
     The 1990 Clean Air Amendments require EPA to
periodically update the requirements applying to OCS
sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward
boundaries to keep them consistent with the
requirements of the corresponding onshore areas
(E&PE 9/4/92).
     Comments on the update should be mailed (in
duplicate if possible) to EPA Air Docket (A-5), Attn:
Docket No. A-93-16, Environmental Protection
Agency, Air and Toxics Division, Region 9, 75

Alberta mulls new well fee

     Alberta regulators are considering imposing a one-
time fee on first-time drillers in the province and
applying the proceeds to restoration of orphan
wellsites.
     The Energy Resources Conservation Board says
the C$10,000 fee would go into a fund to be used to
return orphan wells in Alberta to an environmentally
acceptable state. Operators with a history of drilling in
Alberta will not pay the fee, but any newly formed
company or any operating in the province for the first
time will be subject to the charge.
     Operators now pay a C$500 well licensing fee
along with an orphan well surcharge of C$40 for every
well suspended in 1992. For 1993, this surcharge was
increased to C$60/well.
     The ERCB has identified some 17 orphan wells to
date. Costs for each well vary, depending on the
amount of work needed to properly abandon and clean
up a site.
     The C$10,000 fee is still in the proposal stage, and
is not expected to become standard procedure prior to
this summer. However, while Alberta has some 700
oil and gas companies registered in the province, an
estimated 3,000 companies own all or part of various
Alberta wells.
     This leads to difficulty in tracking down some
owners, and officials believe this is exactly the kind of
problem the new orphan well fee could help alleviate.

EPA issues PM-10 rule

     EPA has issued the final rule revising the
maximum allowable increase for particulate matter
under the requirements for prevention of significant
deterioration (PSD) of air quality.
     Published in the June 3 issue of the Federal
Register (58 FR 31622), the revisions affect the
regulations in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 which specify
the increments for particulate matter with a diameter of
10 micrometers (PM-10) or less.
     The effective date for the rule varies. For the federal
PSD program, the implementation date is June 3,
1994. For EPA-approved state PSD programs, the
rule goes into effect on the date when the state's revised
program, containing the new increments, is approved
by EPA.

Expanded UIC regs opposed

     An expansion of the underground injection control
regulations proposed by EPA has drawn criticism by
independent operators.
     The Federal Advisory Committee is considering the
draft rule being prepared to cover construction
requirements for Class 2 wells under the Safe
Drinking Water Act.
     The rule seeks to expand the area of review
requirements to all wells, increase specific well
construction requirements, and would mandate
increased mechanical integrity testing.
     The expanded requirements were proposed as
safeguards to protect drinking water contamination
from injected oil and gas wastes. Trade groups like the
Independent Petroleum Assn. of America and
Pennsylvania's Independent Oil & Gas Assn. contend
the changes are unwarranted and would be particularly
burdensome to smaller producers.
     They say studies by the Government Accounting
Office and American Petroleum Institute found only
four cases of aquifer contamination from the nation's
170,000 active injection wells and 2.2 million
abandoned or inactive wells.
     The economic estimate provided in the draft rule
forecasts that up to 65% of the total $124 million
compliance costs for the first five years would fall
disproportionately on "small entities" such as stripper
operations concentrated in geographical areas like
Appalachia.
     The independents also point to a 1987 EPA report
to Congress that concluded strippers constitute a
special subcategory of the oil and gas industry that
should be considered independently and which
warrants special regulatory actions tailored to their
operation.
     Barry Russell, IPAA vice president and general
counsel, told E&PE industry has urged EPA to "go
back to the drawing board and recalculate the energy
and cost impacts of any UIC program changes."
