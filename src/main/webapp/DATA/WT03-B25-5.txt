<A NAME="HISTORY">
<CENTER><FONT color=brown SIZE=+1><B><P>A BRIEF HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA LITERATURE</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> The literary history of California begins with the oral traditions of the Native Californians and continues with the writing and printing of occasional pieces - such as religious works, Christmas<I> pastoreles</I> and anonymous poems - during the Spanish and Mexican periods. Perhaps as significant as these locally produced works were those of French, English and American visitors. Most important of these is <B>Richard Henry Dana's</B> "Two Years Before the Mast" (1840), the story of a sea voyage which ends in San Francisco and which attracted considerable attention to the region.

<P>However, not until the Gold Rush brought a large foreign population - mainly from the United States, did the written word flourish locally. The first journal to aim at something more than just printed reports was the "Golden Era," which attracted contributions from the then new state's first literary figures. Later, other journals such as "The Pioneer," "Hutchings' California Magazine" and the "Overland Monthly" sprang up. Together they would help launch the careers of <B>Bret Harte</B>, <B>Mark Twain</B>, <B>Fitz Hugh Ludlow</B>, <B>Joaquin Miller</B> and<B> Ina Coolbrith</B>. Beginning in the 1860's, each would go on to establish considerable reputations with their own books. Typical of the local color found in these works is Twain's "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" (1872).

<P>During the 1880's and 1890's a different set of authors established themselves as representitive of California. These included the short story writer <B>Ambrose Bierce</B>, pioneering science fiction writer<B> Robert Duncan Milne</B>, naturalist <B>John Muir</B>, historian <B>Hubert H. Bancroft</B> and the romantic novelist<B> Helen Hunt Jackson</B>.

<P>Social protest and progressive reform marked the efforts of early 20th century novelists.  <B>Frank Norris</B> - best known for "The Octopus" (1901);<B> Jack London</B> - author of "Sea Wolf" (1904), "The Iron Heel" (1907) and "Martin Eden" (1909); and <B>Gertrude Atherton</B> - whose "The Californians" (1898) and other works were considered daring for a woman of the time, all achieved prominence. <B>Mary Austin</B> - author of the classic "Land of Little Rain" (1903), was a founder of an artistic colony at Carmel early in the century. Other members would include the Bohemian poet <B>George Sterling</B>, and later, <B>Robinson Jeffers</B>. Jeffers - whose fame would eventually place him on the cover of "Time" magazine - made symbolic use of the California coast in long verse tragedies and intense lyrics during the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's.

<P>Naturalism and social realism also marked the fiction of muckraking novelist and Gubernatorial candidate<B> Upton Sinclair</B>, as well as <B>John Steinbeck</B>, whose "The Grapes of Wrath" (1939) and other works depicted the plight of migratory agricultural workers during the Depression. The works of Fresno-born<B> William Saroyan</B>, Los Angeles chronicler<B> John Fante</B> and later longtime Stanford professor <B>Wallace Stegner</B> similarly reflect a naturalism steeped in regionalism. Other notable fiction writers of mid-century and after include<B> Henry Miller</B> (who relocated to Big Sur in 1941), "hardboiled" detective fiction writers<B> Raymond Chandler</B>, <B>Dashiell Hammett</B> and<B> James M. Cain</B>, and <B> Wright Morris, Tillie Olsen,  Evan S. Conell, Richard Brautigan, Joan Didion</B> and Los Angeles icon <B>Charles Bukowski</B>.

<P>The post-War years witnessed the emergence of an alternative poetic tradition in Northern California. Spearheaded by established Bay Area poets <B>Kenneth Rexroth</B>, <B>Robert Duncan</B>, <B>Kenneth Patchen</B> and <B>William Everson</B> - the Beat poets of San Francisco, Berkeley, Bolinas and elsewhere opened-up poetic form and content. Their interactions with Los Angeles artists and New York writers formed the Beat movement. Among the leading proponents of the new American poetry are Northern Californians <B>Lawrence Ferlinghetti</B>,<B> Michael McClure</B> and <B>Gary Synder</B>. 

<P>The exploding immigrant population and growing multiculturalism of California has led to an ever changing literature. From the African - American, Hispanic, and Asian - American communities have emerged significant writers in all genres. Representitive of the African - American voice are Pulitzer-Prize winner <B>Alice Walker</B>, longtime San Francisco resident<B> Maya Angelou</B> and the novelist and poet<B> Ishmael Reed</B>. California's vital Hispanic community - instrinsically tied by language, culture and history to neighboring Mexico, has given readers the voices of <B>Gary Soto</B>, <B>Richard Rodriguez</B> and others. Similarly, California's numerous writers of Asian - American descent look not to Europe for inspiration but to the nations of the Pacific-rim. Representitive among them are <B>Maxine Hong Kingston, Amy Tan</B> and <B>Jessica Hagedorn</B>.
