<H2><center>De-stressing Before You Get Distressed</center></H2>
<p>
	As we all get back into the pace of another academic year, the inevitable "overwhelmed" feelings start creeping up on us.  Stress is inevitable.  And stress can be beneficial.  The trick to making stress work for us, instead of against us, is to recognize what stress is, what stressors we can control, and how we can better cope with the stressors.<p>
	Stress comes from four basic sources:
<ul>
<li><B>Environment</B> -- which controls weather, noise, traffic, pollution, etc.;
<li><B>Social stressors</B> -- which include deadlines, financial issues, employment issues, demands for our 	time and attention, and dealing with friends/loved ones;
<li><B>Physiological stressors</B> -- such as illness, physical changes with age, poor  nutrition, sleep 	disturbances, etc.; and
<li><B>Our thoughts</B> -- when our brains interpret a change as threatening to us, the brain puts us on 	"emergency response" and that is stressful.
</ul>
<p>
	We can deal with stress in a variety of ways.  For example, some people drink alcohol or take drugs to escape from stressors.  Other people look to food, relationships, movies, hobbies, and recreation to block the feelings of stress.  While there is no one perfect means of coping with stress, some methods are more helpful than others.  Recreational sports and exercise in moderation can help stabilize our "mind-set," provide a means for release of energy resulting from stress, and can trigger natural hormones that lend to a sense of well-being.<p>
	Stress can be cumulative.  Events from two year ago may still be affecting you now.

<H2><center>Busting Stress</center></H2>
<p>
	While there are numerous means of coping with stress, here are a few ideas that you could put into action right now to begin lowering your stress level:
<ul>
<li><B>Practice slow, deep breathing.</B>  Allow your lungs to fill to capacity and then slowly exhale.  Repeat this 3 or 4 times.  The increased oxygen helps clear toxins from your body and also helps you feel better.
<li><B>Dispute irrational thoughts.</B>  Irrational ideas are based on outright misperceptions or perfectionistic shoulds, oughts, and musts.  Anytime you catch yourself saying "I ought to...", "I must ...", or
"I should..." you can bet you're headed toward an irrational thought.  Step back from the situation and look specifically at the facts of the situation.  Don't overanalyze.  Look at each fact individually, what your self-talk about the fact/situation is, and what your emotions about the fact/situation are.
Apply the following rules to promote rational thinking:
<ul>
<li>It doesn't do anything to me. The situation doesn't make me anxious or afraid. I say things to myself that produce anxiety and fear.
<li>Everything is exactly the way it should be. To say that things should be different is to throw out causality.
<li>All humans are fallible creatures.
<li>It takes two to have a conflict.  Any party to a conflict is contributing at least 30% of the fuel to keep it going.
<li>The original cause is lost in antiquity.  It is a waste of time to try to discover who did what first.
<li>We feel the way we think.  Events don't cause emotions -- our interpretations of events cause emotions. </ul>
<li><B>Set goals to manage your time to reduce stress.</B>  Get a calendar and mark all of your important due-	dates in it.  Make a daily "to do"list and check off things are you accomplish them.  Reward 	yourself for staying on task and finishing projects.  Build in "down time" to ensure that you have 	time to relax and recoup from deadlines.  Learn to say "no" to things you don't want to do, or don't have time to do.
<li><B>Assert yourself.</B>  You have a right to put yourself first sometimes. You have a right to negotiate for change. You have a right to make mistakes.  You also have a right to own up to your mistakes.
<li><B>Know when to quit.</B>  If you are staying in an activity because you are expected to be there but you really don't like the activity, then quit. (This doesn't apply to academic courses!!)  You are just adding to your stress and frustration by staying in something that you don't appreciate.  Do yourself a favor and find something else you will find more productive.
</ul>
