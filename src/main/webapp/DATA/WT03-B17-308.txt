<PRE>
     When People ask me about the name The Invisible Gardener, I have a
hard  time explaining to them in short terms, a side from the fact that
I got the name from a customer of mine way back in 1972.  At which time
I  did  most  of my gardening at night during the light  of  the  moon.
Gardening  by  the  moon  is an experience in  itself  (that's  another
article)  which  teaches  one about cycles  and  energy  and  how  they
interact   with each other and living things as well: any way The  name
Invisible  Gardener  really  comes from a  deep  understanding  of  the
importance of the inner garden and the outer garden.

     In  my garden lies the secrets of the universe. In my garden  lies
my  beginning and my end. In my garden is truth, beauty and bliss. Such
is  the nature of the garden and not just limited to the garden but  to
all  of the earth and beyond!  The outer Reality is a reflection on the
inner Reality. Which is more real? Within a tree, within a rose, within
a  fish,  within a flower, within Suns, Moons and Stars  lies  the  one
source.

     A successful gardener learns to cultivate the relationship between
being human of the earth and a being of the cosmos.

     How  often have you heard the expression To Discover the  Universe
go within?

       Go  where?  Within yourself. Whether you go within  yourself  or
within a rose, you will find the same thing, the same truth lies there.

     To be in control over life is a very special gift usually reserved
for  the Gods themselves. What is this life that I talk about? The life
within the seed waiting to be released! You have the power to not  only
inject  life  into a seed but to effect its out come! Whether  it  will
live  or  die is now up to you! Whether it is healthy all its  life  or
whether  it  is  sick all of the time is up to you. When  you  come  to
understand  how important your input is to the process, you  will  take
it  more  seriously. Treat life with more respect. Not to  poison  life
with  pesticides, not to push it with fertilizers, not to destroy  life
with pollution of any kind.

     One  of the greatest joys any human being can have is to grow your
own  food, grow your own life! As you practice your art of growing, you
repeat the same patterns that farmers have been using for thousands  of
years.  It  is this process of learning to care for the earth,  of  how
everything is inter changed, intertwined: your very breath is a  plants
air which it in turns breaths in and provides life to it.

       It is very difficult to find the true meaning of life if all you
are  doing  is  killing everything, if all you are doing  is  polluting
everything.  It is no wonder that everywhere one looks one finds  death
and  pollution. This is because we have not remembered the old  fashion
way of growing, one that connects you to the earth not separating you.

     Inner  gardening  is  more  of a raising  of  consciousness  or  a
cultivation  of  consciousness  then  actually  growing  food  but  the
actualization is important as it provides for the physical needs.

     In other words you don't have to have a garden plot in order to do
inner  gardening. Simply put you develop this inner garden within  your
inner being, you cultivate the inner garden within us all.

     This  inner garden can have anything you want in it. You can  grow
inner roses, yes a rose garden within yourself, within your being, will
be  just as beautiful as the rose grown in the earth. Actually a  inner
rose  will  have  an extraordinary fragrance that will  be  capable  of
touching your inner soul.

       Anything  you  grow within this garden will be of that  ethereal
nature that is not found in any earthly garden.

     As  you  go  through life, as you live from day to  day,  you  can
cultivate  this  garden by developing an inner sight of  what  you  see
around you in "real life". I place quotes on real because what we think
is real is really the medium and not the message so to speak.

     What  is the message of the inner garden? That life promotes  life
and  death  promotes death. To kill off all insects and other creatures
of  the earth in the name of life is wrong. Life is not life if  it  is
not  connected to the energy that is all. Life is not life  if  it  not
connected  to  the source. We as human beings have developed  an  anti-
connection attitude. It is this very attitude that will be the  end  of
us  all. We are condemning are children, our children's children  to  a
life  of  pain  and  suffering. Make hay today and  don't  worry  about
tomorrow.   Make  the  big  bucks  now  and  don't  worry   about   the
consequences. This is a very bad attitude to take. Take a look at  what
we are doing to the trees of this planet.

     Where  once  forests were all over this planet, forests  from  one
continent  to  another, where once jungles, rain forests  out  numbered
deserts,  where the USA was covered with trees from end to  the  other,
where the earth was one massive forest, shall I go on?

      I will.

     We  have cut them down for our immediate needs, uncaring about the
effects  it may have on our home, the earth. The effects of  this  goes
beyond  immediate  effects felt during the  same  year  they  were  cut
(immediate effects to birds, insects, other trees, wind, erosion, etc.)
but  the  long term effects it will have upon the billions of lives  on
this  planet, trillions of insect lives, animal lives, sea life,  plant
life.  We may have just speeded up our exhibition. What took the  earth
hundreds of thousands of years to get it together, we have destroyed in
less  then  a  few  thousand years! With the  majority  of  the  damage
occurring  within the last hundred years (over 85% of the earth  forest
have been cut down within the last 50 years!)!

     The  effects of what this uncontrolled damage to the worlds  trees
may  never be measured. We cannot un due what has been done (replanting
is  a  start but will take a min. of  100 years (mother nature actually
would  prefer a few thousand years) before these re planted  tree  will
begin  to  have the same effect on the earth as had their predecessors,
but  we  can  understand what we are doing that's wrong  and  begin  to
redirect our energies in the right direction.

     My  teachings provide people with a foundation from which to  work
with. By following the 5 R's..

     1.....Reduce..2.....Re-use......2.......Recycle.....3.....Rethink......4.....Replant,
we  will make  a  difference,  we will give hope to our children  and  to  their
children     What  about  what  we are doing to ourselves by  ignoring  natures
laws?

     Take   Americans for example. Americans are the sickest people  in
the world!

     Here  are some figures from the Post, Times and USA Today for  the
year 1996:

     1 million Americans have Parkinson disease
     50 million       "            "     hyper tension
     12.4 million     "           "     asthma
     53 million        "           "     migraine headaches
     28 million        "           "     hearing loss
     18  million         "                  abuse alcohol or  drugs  or both
     40 million          "           "      arthritis
      2 million         "            "       brain damage
     25 million        "            "       osteoporosis
     5 million          "            "     elevated ocular pressure
     2 million to 3 million          glaucoma
     10   million                             temporomandibular   joint disorders
     16 million                            obesity
     20 million to 25 million who annually drink pesticide contaminated
water
 with another
   50  million  American  who eat pesticide, fertilizer  contaminated food
     3 million to 7 million  American suffer from food borne disease
     4 million                               Alzheimer's disease
     15 million                            type II diabetes
     59 million                            heart disease
     40 million                            impotence
     3 million                               cancer
     1 million                              chronic fatigue
     20 million                            neck to knee disease
     12 million                           restless leg syndrome
     50 million                           hay fever
     this is not counting
                                                 multiple sclerosis
                                                 lupus
                                                  cystic fibrosis
                                                  tubercul
                                                 measles
                                                 aids
                                                 rabies
                                                etc...
     That comes to at least 543 million disease ridden Americans, which
means  that in a country with only 266 million people( many  have  more
then one disease), Americans are the sickest people in the world!

    I wonder why?

     We  are  polluting  ourselves through many  different  means  from
pesticides to nuclear waste. In order to achieve our goal of being  the
riches  nation  in the world we have become the sickest nation  in  the
world.  Americans have hit upon the perfect death sentence.  They  have
developed this to an art. Dam the torpedoes full steam ahead!

     To  destroy  our environment while at the same time poisoning  our
food, water and earth, air, river, lake, oceans, mountains, etc.  is  a
perfect way to slowly kill off living things upon this planet. To  make
matters  worse,  the rest of the world is following in  America's  foot
steps(  by the way, I haven't even mentioned war , agriculture and  the
medical profession!

It is no wonder that we have so many illnesses in our society. Remember
the basic law of nature which says "As above so below"? What that means
pertaining to what I have just mentioned is that as you use toxins you
will become toxic! As you destroy the external world you also destroy
the internal world, that inner world that is so important. You cannot
have one without the other- you cannot affect one with affecting the
other.

I truly believe that every illness or disease previously mentioned is a
direct result of this self abuse of the inner world through the mis use
of the outer world. By poisoning ourselves with one chemical or
another, by poisoning ourselves with one chemical fertilizer or
another(yes fertilizers), by poisoning ourselves with herbicides,
fungicides, by poisoning ourselves with food additives, preservations,
coloring, stabilizers, etc., by poisoning our water with flurried,
chlorine, etc., by poisoning ourselves through improper heath
practices(drugs, alcohol, sexual abuse, mental abuse, spiritual abuse),
buy starving ourselves through food grown improperly and which have no
food value, by posioning ourselves through products that are supposed
to be safe for us to either intake, ingest, inject, some how apply to
our bodies, we are poisoning ourselves by surrounding ourselves with
electrical fields, poisonous gases(exhaust from auto, trucks,
industries, etc.), we are poisoning ourselves by living within toxic
structures that promote illness and diseases, structures that do not
follow nature laws and separate or dis connect us from the earth ( our
shoes are made to separate us from our earth connection( when was the
last time you walk on a filed bare footed?).

All of these things add to one very sick society of people no longer
with goals of life and happiness but of self destruction.
We are constantly producing new diseases at an alarming rate,
diseases never found on this planet several years ago.
Where does all this lead to? It doesn't paint a pretty picture.
But don't give up! There is hope! Knowledge is a very powerful weapon
against this. Knowledge will set you free. The simple art of reading
this makes you aware of the true problem. Your consciousness has just
been raised a little bit enough for you no longer to be the same person
you were before you started reading this.
Don't let others determine your happiness or your health. I am not
against progress but let us progress in the right direction. It is not
progress if you gain wealth but lose yourself!

My hands are blooming!
My Fingers are growing Roses!</H2></STRONG>

Happy Growing Internally Of course!
    Yours
