  This paper explains the interdisciplinary team concept blended with the 
family-centered approach in a psychiatric setting and applies the approach in a 
case study of a family with a child diagnosed with mental retardation, autism, 
and severe behavior problems.  Practical suggestions for implementing such a 
family-centered/interdisciplinary team approach are offered.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  This report documents the fifth year of follow-up of mentally retarded school 
completers in the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) area, begun with parents/ guardians 
of students who completed their special education programs in 1985-86 (N=73) 
and in 1986-87 (N=60), 1990 (N=102), and in 1991 continued with completers 
(N=95), when a preliminary follow-up study was done.  Findings for the first 
two groups are reported in terms of living arrangements, work situations, 
competitive employment, physical and emotional disabilities, expectations and 
outcomes (a retrospective), and the hard core idle.  The 1990 cohort is 
discussed in terms of living arrangements, work situations, competitive 
employment, training and placement, transition planning and outcomes, and 
comparison of work and living arrangements of three cohorts 1 year after 
completion.  Initial follow-up data for the 1991 school completers are 
presented for living arrangements, work situations, job placements, post-school 
training placements, transition planning, and comparison with the 1990 cohort.  
Conclusions on the oldest group include more movement into a variety of 
competitive and sheltered work situations, entrenched patterns of idleness by 
14 percent of the group, and no progress for those with multiple disabilities.  
Conclusions for the 1990 cohort include substantial similarities with 
experiences of the older group at the same stage.  Findings for the 1991 cohort 
included a higher proportion with no work placement.  (DB)<BR>

  The education of students with severe to profound mental handicaps (SPH) or 
multiple disabilities may be greatly limited in rural settings.  A survey 
investigating this issue in a southwestern state was completed by 136 of 346 
directors of special education, 67 of whom worked in rural special education 
cooperatives.  These cooperatives served 393 preschool, 851 elementary, and 828 
secondary students with SPH or multiple disabilities.  However, only 4 percent 
of teachers of these students possessed SPH certification, and only 26 percent 
possessed certification in mental retardation (MR).  Figures were similar for 
individual rural districts and urban areas.  The most common service delivery 
systems used by rural cooperatives were self-contained classrooms: (1) 32.5% of 
cooperatives for SPH elementary students; (2) 31% for MR elementary students; 
(3) 20% for SPH secondary students; and (4) 26% for MR secondary students.  
Developmentally-based program models were reported by 86 percent of rural 
cooperatives and ecologically-based programs by 29 percent.  The fact that few 
districts used transdisciplinary teaming may indicate a lack of understanding 
of this model rather than a conscious decision to use other models.  Survey 
results suggest that the quality of services available for SPH and multiply 
disabled students is limited by lack of qualified teachers, little use of 
ecological procedures, and a tendency to ignore functional and near-future 
needs.  (SV)<BR>

  This resource guide presents general information about disabilities and 
summaries of relevant federal laws.  A question-and-answer format is used to 
highlight key features of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act 
(Public Law 94-142, reauthorized in 1990 as the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Public Law 99-
457; and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Then individual sections provide 
information on vision impairments, hearing impairments, speech impairments, 
physical disabilities, mental retardation, learning disabilities, multiple 
disabilities, emotional disorders, autism, and other health impairments.  
Information provided typically includes the nature of the impairment, severity 
factors, associated problems, aids and appliances, therapeutic or remediation 
approaches, simulation activities, and resources (books for both children and 
adults as well as organizations).  Specifically discussed under physical 
disabilities and other health impairments are the following conditions: 
cerebral palsy, spina bifida, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy (Duchene 
type), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, brittle bone disease, 
and amputation.  The guide also presents lists of general print and 
organizational resources, guidelines for use of less stigmatizing terminology, 
and suggestions for interacting with individuals with disabilities.  (DB)<BR>

  This handbook for parents is part of a packet intended to aid educators, 
families, and adult service providers to facilitate the transition from school 
to adult life in the community for students with both cognitive disabilities 
and visual or dual sensory impairments.  Emphasis is on preparation of students 
for adult lifestyles through transition planning and community based 
instruction, including vocational experiences.  Introductory sections describe 
the handbook and identify goals.  The first major section examines the parent's 
role as children approach adulthood and covers sharing information and 
participating in goal selection, selection of learning experiences and skills 
to be developed, exploration of post-school options, and development of more 
appropriate options.  The transition process is explained next, which includes 
the transition planning team, Individualized Education Programs and Transition 
Plans, the transition planning meeting, areas for transition planning, and a 
transition planning form.  The last section identifies issues in planning for 
adulthood including: working with state agencies; vocational options; living 
arrangements; financial planning; travel; recreation and leisure; family 
support; legal services; and advocacy.  Appendices include three references and 
lists of locations of parent resource centers, state rehabilitation agencies 
and resource centers, and state protection and advocacy agencies.  Additional 
appendices list specific agencies in New York State.  (DB)<BR>
