<h3>8. Meeting with Aldous Huxley </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the mid-1950s, two books by Aldous Huxley
appeared, <i>The Doors of Perception </i>and <i>Heaven and Hell, </i>dealing
with inebriated states produced by hallucinogenic drugs. The
alterations of sensory perceptions and consciousness, which the
author experienced in a self-experiment with mescaline, are
skillfully described in these books. The mescaline experiment was
a visionary experience for Huxley. He saw objects in a new light;
they disclosed their inherent, deep, timeless existence, which
remains hidden from everyday sight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These two books contained fundamental observations
on the essence of visionary experience and about the significance
of this manner of comprehending the world&#151;in cultural
history, in the creation of myths, in the origin of religions,
and in the creative process out of which works of art arise.
Huxley saw the value of hallucinogenic drugs in that they give
people who lack the gift of spontaneous visionary perception
belonging to mystics, saints, and great artists, the potential to
experience this extraordinary state of consciousness, and thereby
to attain insight into the spiritual world of these great
creators. Hallucinogens could lead to a deepened understanding of
religious and mystical content, and to a new and fresh experience
of the great works of art. For Huxley these drugs were keys
capable of opening new doors of perception; chemical keys, in
addition to other proven but laborious &quot; door openers&quot;
to the visionary world like meditation, isolation, and fasting,
or like certain yoga practices. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the time I already knew the earlier work of this
great writer and thinker, books that meant much to me, like <i>Point
Counter Point, Brave New World, After Many a Summer, Eyeless in
Gaza,</i> and a few others. In <i>The Doors of Perception </i>and
<i>Heaven and Hell,</i> Huxley's newly-published works, I found a
meaningful exposition of the experience induced by hallucinogenic
drugs, and I thereby gained a deepened insight into my own LSD
experiments. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was therefore delighted when I received a
telephone call from Aldous Huxley in the laboratory one morning
in August 1961. He was passing through Zurich with his wife. He
invited me and my wife to lunch in the Hotel Sonnenberg. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A gentleman with a yellow freesia in his
buttonhole, a tall and noble appearance, who exuded
kindness&#151;this is the image I retained from this first
meeting with Aldous Huxley. The table conversation revolved
mainly around the problem of magic drugs. Both Huxley and his
wife, Laura Archera Huxley, had also experimented with LSD and
psilocybin. Huxley would have preferred not to designate these
two substances and mescaline as &quot;drugs,&quot; because in
English usage, as also by the way with <i>Droge</i> in German,
that word has a pejorative connotation, and because it was
important to differentiate the hallucinogens from the other
drugs, even linguistically. He believed in the great importance
of agents producing visionary experience in the modern phase of
human evolution. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He considered experiments under laboratory
conditions to be insignificant, since in the extraordinarily
intensified susceptibility and sensitivity to external
impressions, the surroundings are of decisive importance. He
recommended to my wife, when we spoke of her native place in the
mountains, that she take LSD in an alpine meadow and then look
into the blue cup of a gentian flower, to behold the wonder of
creation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As we parted, Aldous Huxley gave me, as a
remembrance of this meeting, a tape recording of his lecture
&quot;Visionary Experience,&quot; which he had delivered the week
before at an international congress on applied psychology in
Copenhagen. In this lecture, Aldous Huxley spoke about the
meaning and essence of visionary experience and compared this
type of world view to the verbal and intellectual comprehension
of reality as its essential complement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the following year, the newest and last book by
Aldous Huxley appeared, the novel <i>Island.</i> This story, set
on the utopian island Pala, is an attempt to blend the
achievements of natural science and technical civilization with
the wisdom of Eastern thought, to achieve a new culture in which
rationalism and mysticism are fruitfully united. The <i>moksha </i>medicine,
a magical drug prepared from a mushroom, plays a significant role
in the life of the population of Pala (moksha is Sanskrit for
&quot;release,&quot; &quot;liberation&quot;). The drug could be
used only in critical periods of life. The young men on Pala
received it in initiation rites, it is dispensed to the
protagonist of the novel during a life crisis, in the scope of a
psychotherapeutic dialogue with a spiritual friend, and it helps
the dying to relinquish the mortal body, in the transition to
another existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In our conversation in Zurich, I had already
learned from Aldous Huxley that he would again treat the problem
of psychedelic drugs in his forthcoming novel. Now he sent me a
copy of <i>Island,</i> inscribed &quot;To Dr. Albert Hofmann, the
original discoverer of the <i>moksha </i>medicine, from Aldous
Huxley.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hopes that Aldous Huxley placed in psychedelic
drugs as a means of evoking visionary experience, and the uses of
these substances in everyday life, are subjects of a letter of 29
February 1962, in which he wrote me: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . I have good hopes that this and similar work will
    result in the development of a real Natural History of
    visionary experience, in all its variations, determined by
    differences of physique, temperament and profession, and at
    the same time of a technique of Applied Mysticism&#151;a
    technique for helping individuals to get the most out of
    their transcendental experience and to make use of the
    insights from the &quot;Other World&quot; in the affairs of
    &quot;This World.&quot; Meister Eckhart wrote that &quot;what
    is taken in by contemplation must be given out in love.&quot;
    Essentially this is what must be developed&#151;the art of
    giving out in love and intelligence what is taken in from
    vision and the experience of self-transcendence and
    solidarity with the Universe.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aldous Huxley and I were together often at the
annual convention of the World Academy of Arts and Sciences
(WAAS) in Stockholm during late summer 1963. His suggestions and
contributions to discussions at the sessions of the academy,
through their form and importance, had a great influence on the
proceedings. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; WAAS had been established in order to allow the
most competent specialists to consider world problems in a forum
free of ideological and religious restrictions and from an
international viewpoint encompassing the whole world. The
results: proposals, and thoughts in the form of appropriate
publications, were to be placed at the disposal of the
responsible governments and executive organizations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 1963 meeting of WAAS had dealt with the
population explosion and the raw material reserves and food
resources of the earth. The corresponding studies and proposals
were collected in Volume II of WAAS under the title <i>The
Population Crisis and the Use of World Resources.</i> A decade
before birth control, environmental protection, and the energy
crisis became catchwords, these world problems were examined
there from the most serious point of view, and proposals for
their solution were made to governments and responsible
organizations. The catastrophic events since that time in the
aforementioned fields makes evident the tragic discrepancy
between recognition, desire, and feasibility. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aldous Huxley made the proposal, as a continuation
and complement of the theme &quot;World Resources&quot; at the
Stockholm convention, to address the problem &quot;Human
Resources,&quot; the exploration and application of capabilities
hidden in humans yet unused. A human race with more highly
developed spiritual capacities, with expanded consciousness of
the depth and the incomprehensible wonder of being, would also
have greater understanding of and better consideration for the
biological and material foundations of life on this earth. Above
all, for Western people with their hypertrophied rationality, the
development and expansion of a direct, emotional experience of
reality, unobstructed by words and concepts, would be of
evolutionary significance. Huxley considered psychedelic drugs to
be one means to achieve education in this direction. The
psychiatrist Dr. Humphry Osmond, likewise participating in the
congress, who had created the term <i>psychedelic </i>(mind-expanding),
assisted him with a report about significant possibilities of the
use of hallucinogens. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The convention in Stockholm in 1963 was my last
meeting with Aldous Huxley. His physical appearance was already
marked by a severe illness; his intellectual personage, however,
still bore the undiminished signs of a comprehensive knowledge of
the heights and depths of the inner and outer world of man, which
he had displayed with so much genius, love, goodness, and humor
in his literary work. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aldous Huxley died on 22 November of the same year,
on the same day President Kennedy was assassinated. From Laura
Huxley I obtained a copy of her letter to Julian and Juliette
Huxley, in which she reported to her brother- and sister-in-law
about her husband's last day. The doctors had prepared her for a
dramatic end, because the terminal phase of cancer of the throat,
from which Aldous Huxley suffered, is usually accompanied by
convulsions and choking fits. He died serenely and peacefully,
however. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the morning, when he was already so weak that he
could no longer speak, he had written on a sheet of paper:
&quot;LSD&#151;try it&#151;intramuscular&#151;100 mmg.&quot; Mrs.
Huxley understood what was meant by this, and ignoring the
misgivings of the attending physician, she gave him, with her own
hand, the desired injection-she let him have the moksha medicine.
