<TD><b><font COLOR="#000000">Learning a new sport or
a complex physical activity is a biomodifier.<hr></b></font>It results in more hard-wired
connections in the brain. Researchers at the University of Illinois compared
middle-aged rats who did routine exercises on a padded wheel every day
with middle-aged rats who ran through a complex obstacle-course a few times
every day. Rats who were more challenged established more brain connections.

<TD><b><font COLOR="#000000">Thinking sexually exciting thoughts
is a biomodifier. <hr></b></font>Next time you are worried about something, replace the
anxious thought with an exciting one, and your body will find it easier
to relax. According to Craig B. Mardus, Ph. D., author of &quot;How to
Make Worry Work For You,&quot; what you want to do is replace the fear
that is in the worried thought. When you replace it with excitment, you
will be able to relax quicker because relaxation is automatic after excitement,
but not after fear. </b>

<TD><b><font COLOR="#000000">Forgiving and forgetting is a
biomodifier.</b> </font>Holding grudges and seeking revenge can actually harm your
heart. A study published in the American Heart Association journal &quot;Circulation&quot;
in November 1995 expands on earlier findings that outbursts of anger double
your heart attack risk for two hours after the outburst. </font></font></b>

People who learn to be optimistic in the face of losses and failures promote
their own physical and mental health. People who respond with feelings
of helplessness may experience surges of stress hormones which can undermine
the heart and other internal organs, or they may undergo changes in their
immune systems which can lead to cancer and other diseases. </b>

is a biomodifier. </b></font>If you expect to be healthy, you will have a better
chance of staying healthy than if you expect to be sick. Those who expect
the worst, are sick more than the rest of us. </font></font></b>

<TD><b><font COLOR="#000000">Laughing is a biomodifier.</b></font> Laughter
decreases the amount of stress hormones present in your body. Lee Berk
and Stanley Tan at Loma Linda University Medical Center in California have
shown that laughter significantly decreases serum cortisol levels, which
increases during stressful situations. High Cortisol levels weaken the
immune system. </b>

Your brain burns more glucose in the left frontal area when you are feeling
happy. Psychologist Richard Davidson, at the University of Wisconsin, used
brain-imaging devices to show the increased glucose-burning activity during
this emotional state. </b>

<TD><b><font COLOR="#000000">Controlling your own life is
a biomodifier.</b></font> Researchers at Rutgers University have found even babies
experience more happiness when they control their environments. Psychologist
Michael Lewis found that when babies can pull on a string tied around their
own wrist and make a picture appear, they are happier than they are when
the pictures are taken away and have no control over their appearance or
disappearance. </b>
