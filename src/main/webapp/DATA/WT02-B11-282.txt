COMPUTER SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY ADVISORY BOARD <p>

RESOLUTION 93-5 <p>

September 1-2, 1993 <p>

Subsequent to the June 2-4, 1993 meeting of the CSSPAB, the Board
has held an additional 4 days of public hearings and has
collected additional public input. <p>

The clear message is that the preliminary concerns stated in
Resolution 1 of that date have been confirmed as serious concerns
which need to be resolved. <p>

Public input has heightened the concerns of the Board to the
following issues: <p>

-    A convincing statement of the problem that Clipper
          attempts to solve has not been provided. <p>

-    Export and import controls over cryptographic products
          must be reviewed.  Based upon data compiled from U.S.
          and international vendors, current controls are
          negatively impacting U.S. competitiveness in the world
          market and are not inhibiting the foreign production
          and use of cryptography (DES and RSA). <p>

-    The Clipper/Capstone proposal does not address the
          needs of the software industry, which is a critical and
          significant component of the National Information
          Infrastructure and the U.S. economy. <p>

-    Additional DES encryption alternatives and key
          management alternatives should be considered since
          there is a significant installed base. <p>

-    The individuals reviewing the Skipjack algorithm and
          key management system must be given an appropriate time
          period and environment in which to perform a thorough
          review.  This review must address the escrow protocol
          and chip implementation as well as the algorithm
          itself. <p>

-    Sufficient information must be provided on the proposed
          key escrow scheme to allow it to be fully understood by
          the general public. <p>

-    Further development and consideration of alternatives
          to the key escrow scheme need to be considered, e.g.,
          three "escrow" entities, one of which is a non-
          government agency, and a software based solution. <p>

-    The economic implications for the Clipper/Capstone
          proposal have not been examined.  These costs go beyond
          the vendor cost of the chip and include such factors as
          customer installation, maintenance, administration,
          chip replacement, integration and interfacing,
          government escrow system costs, etc. <p>

-    Legal issues raised by the proposal must be reviewed. <p>

-    Congress, as well as the Administration, should play a
          role in the conduct and approval of the results of the
          review. <p>

Moreover, the following are additional concerns of the Board: <p>

-    Implementation of the Clipper initiative may negatively
          impact the availability of cost-effective security
          products to the U.S. Government and the private sector; <p>

and <p>

-    Clipper products may not be marketable or usable
          worldwide. <p>

          Rand, Walker, Whitehurst, and Zeitler <p>

COMPUTER SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY ADVISORY BOARD <p>

RESOLUTION 93-6 <p>

SEPTEMBER 1-2, 1993 <p>

The Board believes that in deciding cryptographic policies and
standards in the U.S., there is a compelling need to consider and
evaluate the concerns listed below.  We, therefore, endorse the
process being pursued by the administration in the form of an
interagency review but believe the scope of that review needs to
include adequate industry input.  We reaffirm our recommendation
(of March 1992) that the issues surrounding this policy be
debated in a public forum.  In view of the worldwide significance
of these issues the Board believes that the Congress of the U.S.
must be involved in the establishment of cryptographic policy. <p>

The Board, furthermore, believes that there are a number of
issues that must be resolved before any new or additional
cryptographic solution is approved as a U.S. government standard: <p>

1.   The protection of law enforcement and national security
          interests; <p>

2.   The protection of U.S. computer and telecommunication
          interests in the international marketplace; and <p>

3.   The protection of U.S. persons' interests both
          domestically and internationally. <p>

FOR:      Castro, Gallagher, Gangemi, Lambert, Lipner, Kuyers,
          Philcox, Rand, Walker, Whitehurst, and Zeitler <p>

AGAINST:  none <p>

ABSTAIN:  none <p>
