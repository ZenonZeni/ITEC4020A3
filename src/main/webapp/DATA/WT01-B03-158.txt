<H2>Shattered and Lost Lives</H2>
<DL>
<DD><P>In terms of human suffering, the consequences of untreated depression are beyond measure. They include loss of 
self-esteem, "self-medication" with alcohol and drugs, family and career disruption, chronic disability and, in many cases, 
death. Suicide is now the second leading cause of death among children and adolescents. </P>
</DL>
<H2>It Costs Billions -- and Everybody Pays</H2>
<DL>
<DD><P>Estimates of the cost range from 15 to 35 billion dollars a year and encompass the loss of time and productivity,
personnel replacement, medical care, and loss of life. Not only affected individuals, but their families, friends, 
employers, colleagues, and the community-at-large share in these costs.</P>
</DL>
<H2>Urgent Attention Is Required</H2>
<DL>
<DD><P>Two brief mentions of Affective Disorders in a national newspaper column stimulated almost 100,000 requests for 
further information. A network television program depicting Depressive Illness brought in 200,000 letters.</P>
 
<P>Despite the severity, magnitude, and cost of this problem, expenditures on public information, professional education, 
and research are minuscule in comparison with the efforts made on behalf of other, oftentimes less prevalent, disorders.
