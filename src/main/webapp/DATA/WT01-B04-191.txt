<h4>General Suggestions</h4>

<br>
<!-- insert graphic re: scheduling depict a matrix with students names down
one column and time periods across top --><br>
<br>
<p>Many VE teachers have raised concerns about the way that students are
scheduled into their classes.  They feel that they have to work around the
demands of all other programs in the school.  A proactive approach is needed to
facilitate appropriate scheduling.  The following list provides a number of
suggestions that may assist the VE teacher in developing the classroom schedule
at the beginning of the school year.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Try not to remove ESE students from their homeroom time.  Wait until
announcements are finished.
<br>
<li>Allow time in the weekly or semester schedule for non-instructional duties,
such as paperwork, testing, conferencing with parents and teachers, and
planning.
<br>
<li>Be firm and assertive about scheduling for the time specified on the student's
IEP.
<br>
<li>If you must teach more than one subject at a time, make sure you have the
support you need.  For some students and subjects, an integrated and
interdisciplinary approach to instruction works very well.
<br>
<li>Make individual plans for students that could be used for a period of time.
Students could keep track of accomplishments and check off work as they
complete it.  Assignments may be posted on the bulletin board and students can
be responsible for tracking their completion.
<br>
<li>Stress day-by-day organization which is as critical as the weekly or yearly
plan.  Students need to know exactly what to do each day and the rules should
be consistently applied.
<br>
<li>Be aware of practices like Friday testing in the regular classroom.  Correlate
your activities as appropriate.
<br>
<li>Provide lesson plans for aides and volunteers so they will know what to do.
<br>
</ul><P>

<h4>
<A NAME = "Elementary Programs">Elementary Programs</A></h4>
<p>The following suggestions are intended to help teachers in elementary
schools whose ESE students regularly participate in mainstream programs.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Use the school's master schedule to identify times when all ESE students are
in mainstream programs, such as music, art, and physical education; include
lunch and other common times.
<br>
<li>Coordinate with the regular teacher's classroom schedule.  Where possible and
appropriate, the ESE student should remain in the regular classroom for classes
and activities in which they can experience success.
<br>
<li>Try to schedule students in the VE class for the subject or area identified on
the IEP at the same time their regular class has this scheduled.  Arrange the
VE schedule so that students can be grouped by academic or social needs, not
necessarily by grade level or by exceptionality.
<br>
<li>Sometimes, you may find that the all of the regular classes offer the targeted
subjects, like reading, at the same time of day.  The VE schedule becomes
overloaded at certain times during the day and very light at others.  The ESE
teacher may be able to negotiate with the regular teacher or the school
administrator to adjust the schedule or to accommodate the ESE students in the
regular class.
<br>
<li>If you have both part-time and full-time students in the class, try to
schedule students so that they can be grouped by functional level.
<br>

<h4>
<A NAME = "Secondary Programs">Secondary Programs</A>
</h4>
<p>The following suggestions are intended for teachers in middle and high
schools.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>ESE students should be hand-scheduled or scheduled first if a computer program
is used to ensure that appropriate courses and instructors are selected.  This
will help to avoid  placing students in inappropriate classes.
<br>
<li>Providing a consistent structure can assist students in meeting requirements
of many different teachers.  Daily reviews of expectations in each class will
promote improved behavior.
<br>
<li>Help students who are new to the school find their way around.  Older students
can be assigned to help new students for the first few weeks.

<h2>
<A NAME = "Grouping for Instruction">Grouping for Instruction</A></h2><br>

<br>
<p>After the schedule has been set for the VE class, the teacher must determine
how the students will be grouped for instruction.  The effective use of
grouping techniques can result in a classroom that functions as a real learning
community.  The following section provides descriptions of major types of
grouping techniques, with guidelines for determining the benefits of each type
of grouping, and recommendations and cautions for effective use of the grouping
technique.<br>
<br>
<i>Although each exceptional student has an Individual Education Plan and
should be provided individualized instruction and assessment, students can
benefit from participation in group instruction and group work.  </i><br>

<h3>
<A NAME = "Independent Learning">Independent Learning</A>
</h3><br>
<br>
<!-- insert graphic of independent learner--maybe with computer--><br>
<i>What does this accomplish?</i><br>
<br>
<p>Independent learning provides opportunities for students in VE classes
to practice needed skills, promote responsibility and individual effort, and
build time management skills and self-directed work habits. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Who benefits?</i><br>
<br>
<p>All students in VE classes can benefit from independent learning activities.
Even prekindergarten students in play activities are learning independently.
Older students requiring drill and practice for skill development and
reinforcement may use this method.  In self-guided learning activities,
students can work at their own pace. <br>
<br>
<i>How do you make this work?</i><br>
<br>
<b>Select the activities.</b> The types of activities used for
independent learning do not have to be limited to paper-and-pencil worksheets.
Activity centers can be created in which students can work on interesting
tasks.  Creative centers promote self-expression.  The computer is a natural
tool for an independent learning activity center.<br>
<br>
<b>Provide a management routine.</b> Students will need to be able to perform
the expected behaviors and outcomes of independent learning activities.
Students should be able to select, retrieve, and return all needed equipment
and materials.  The more you can rely on students to do things for themselves,
the more they will gain from the activities.<br>
<br>
<b>Provide feedback on performance.</b> Even though the activities are
independent, students will need direct feedback on their performance.  Many ESE
students benefit from clear evidence of their progress.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Any cautions?</i><br>
<br>
<b>Selection of activities.</b> Teachers in VE classes must provide the
structure for independent learning activities.  Activities should be carefully
selected so that they are appropriate for the students.  They should neither be
too difficult nor too easy.  Independent learning activities must be
sufficiently challenging and even more important, they must be interesting to
the students.<br>
<br>
<b>Arranging the learning environment.</b>The learning environment in the VE
class must be arranged so that students can easily locate the materials
themselves.  Students also should learn how to get help in ways that do not
disrupt the rest of the classroom activities.  Silent signals and learning
buddies are two methods that have worked in many classrooms.<br>

<h3>
<A NAME = "One-on-One Instruction">One-on-One Instruction</A>
</h3>
<P>
<!--insert graphic with one on one instruction--><br>
<br>
<i>What does this accomplish?</i><br>
<br>
<p>One-on-one instruction is used to provide the most intensive kind of
instruction.  Modeling, prompting, and feedback can be individualized to
anticipate and respond directly to the learner's needs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Who benefits?</i><br>
<br>
<p>Students requiring personal contact for information to be processed will
require one-on-one instruction.  All students in a VE class may require
one-on-one instruction from time to time.  Students who are most likely to need
this type of instruction include the following:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>New Students</b>--Students who do not know the classroom routine do not
know how to get help independently.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Students in Crisis</b>--Students who temporarily lack self-control need
much direct support and structure.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Students Learning a New Skill</b>--Students learning new skills require
careful attention to the modeling and feedback provided by the teacher.
Sometimes this is most efficiently delivered on a personalized basis.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Students with Sensory Impairments</b>--Students whose ability to receive
information is impaired may require personal contact.  Some dual sensory
impaired students need to have the sign language transmitted in their hand.<br>
<br>
</ul>
<i>How do you make this work?</i><br>
<br>
<p>The most successful use of one-on-one instruction necessitates careful
planning.  When the VE teacher anticipates the need for this approach, the
appropriate conditions can be arranged.  A classroom management program is
needed for the other students and could involve peer tutoring, independent task
completion routines, and use of assistants and volunteers.  One-on-one
instruction may require the classroom teacher for delivery, but it may also be
provided by teacher assistants or through computer-assisted instruction.  In
some cases, the teacher can get the process started, then move aside as other
support mechanisms take over.<br>
<br>
<i>Any cautions?</i><br>
<br>
<p>As in any ESE class, teachers need to keep the goal of independent learning at
the forefront. In VE classes, students often need a lot of one-on-one
instruction at first.  Plan to fade some of the direct assistance as the child
becomes acclimated to the classroom or more proficient in practicing the new
skill.  Where groups of students must be instructed together, shift back and
forth from whole group participation to individual instruction and response.
When students in VE classes are taught how to be independent learners, they can
become partners in the process.<br>

<h3>
<A NAME = "Large and Small Groups">Large and Small Groups</A>
</h3><P>
<i>What does this accomplish?</i><br>
<p>For students with similar learning needs, group instruction provides an
efficient method for demonstrations, information presentations, and modeling.
For students with more diverse learning needs, group instruction can be used to
provide shared experiences.  Many VE classrooms use cooperative learning groups
to accommodate the diversity of student learning needs.<br>
<br>
<i>Who benefits?</i><br>
<p>Students of all ages can benefit from group learning experiences.  Very
young students may require smaller groups and activities that are relatively
short.  Older students will need activities that are well paced and easy to
follow.  Students with disabilities may need to learn how to participate in
group activities.<br>
<br>
<i>How do you make this work?</i><br>
<b>Keep grouping flexible. </b> Planning for instruction in a VE class requires
the teacher to consider the needs of  all students in the class.  Students may
be grouped for specific skill learning or for concept development.  Because of
the diversity within a VE class, teachers often must group and regroup students
throughout the day.  Most students can adjust to this type of flexibility as
long as it is predictable.  Students can follow a task card, with symbols
representing where they are to be.  A timer in the classroom can help to signal
change in activities.  <br>
<br>
<b>Use media to enhance presentations. </b> When information must be presented
to a group of students, visual and auditory aids are particularly useful.
These aids can reinforce the key points.   Concrete examples are generally the
most effective presentation aids.<br>
<br>
<b>Keep students actively involved.  </b>Learning requires active involvement.
Listening is rarely sufficient for students in VE classes to gain the
information and understanding provided through verbal instruction.  Use a lot
of cues to focus the student's attention.  Students can also participate in
group instruction in a variety of ways.  Assign each student a different role
or expectation, then have them collaborate to complete a related task.<br>
<br>
<b>Combine a variety of activities.  </b>Many teachers find group instruction
successful when they combine several activities within a class period.  Begin
the lesson with an advanced organizer that "sets the stage" and provides an
overview of the lesson or a link to what was done in previous lessons.  The
lesson can easily combine whole-group, small-group, and individual activities.
Don't forget to end the lesson with a summary or post-organizer.<br>
<br>
<i>Any cautions?</i><br>
<p>Monitoring student response to group instruction is the key to its
effectiveness.  Students will be processing information at different rates and
varying in their participation.  The teacher must always check for
understanding.  Group feedback can be effective for some activities.  However,
individual feedback may also be required.<br><P>

<h3><A NAME = "Students in the Mainstream">Students in the Mainstream</A></h3>
<P>
<i>What does this accomplish?</i><br>
<br>
<p>To the extent appropriate, exceptional students should be provided education in
the least restrictive environment.  For the majority of ESE students, this
means participation in mainstream programs with their peers. <P>

<i>Who benefits?</i><br>

<p>ESE students can benefit from both the instructional and socialization
opportunities available through placement in regular classes.  For some,
accommodations may need to be provided  in terms of instructional methods,
communication modes, and assessment procedures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>How do you make this work?</i><br>
<br>
<p>A structured process has been widely used in Florida to promote the
successful integration of exceptional students in mainstream classes.
Cooperative Consultation (Riegel, 1988) provides a set of easy to use
checklists and forms through which exceptional education and mainstream
teachers can assess needs and plan realistic alternatives for students
encountering difficulty in the school setting.  The process facilitates open
communication among the professionals and with the students.  The result is a
shared responsibility for implementing alternatives and monitoring the outcomes
for the student.  The process requires the following steps:  <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Assess the ESE student's educational needs.<br>
<br>
<li>Assess the demands of the mainstream environment.<br>
<br>
<li>Determine any modifications or accommodations needed for the ESE
student.<br>
<br>
<li>Monitor the implementation of the modifications and the progress of the ESE
student.<br>
<br>
</ul>
<i>Any cautions?</i><br>
<br>
<p>Mainstreaming works well when the mainstream teacher, the ESE teacher,
and the ESE student have clearly communicated and agreed upon their
expectations and responsibilities.  When success is left to chance, results are
generally uneven.  <P>

<h3><A NAME = "Arranging the Furniture">Arranging the Furniture</A></h3>
<P>
Because of the wide variability in classroom size and location, no
single arrangement for desks and centers will work in all VE classrooms.  The
following arrangements are provided to represent the typical types of
classrooms and the advantages and disadvantages are listed to help teachers
decide which arrangement works best for them (adapted from <i>The Solution
Book</i>, SRA).<br>
<br>
<b>CLASSROOM STYLE</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<IMG align=center SRC="DOC71.gif"><br>
<br>
<u>Benefits</u><br>
<p>This arrangement has been the traditional arrangements in classrooms for
many years.  It places the teacher at the head of the classroom and faces all
students to the center of instruction.  It is an efficient use of space, and
may be used to keep individual desks away from learning centers, computers, or
other special features in the classroom.  When large group instruction and
presentation by the teacher is the most frequently used format, this style is
preferred.<br>
<br>
<u>Problems</u><br>
<p>When students are arranged in rows, the students at the back of the
classroom may have difficulty seeing the chalkboard or other visual aids in the
front of the room.  Students also may be too close together for independent
work, and behavior problems may result.  <br>
<b>CLUSTER STYLE</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<IMG align=center SRC="DOC72.gif"><br>
<u>Benefits</u><br>
<p>Grouping desks in clusters can be used in classes to support cooperative
learning activities, and team work.  In many VE classes, there are small groups
of students who are working on the same level, and this classroom arrangement
could facilitate their instruction.  Praise can be delivered to groups of
students as well as to individuals.  <br>
<br>
<u>Problems</u><br>
<p>This arrangement may require more classroom space and leave little room
for learning centers or other special classroom areas.  Because students are
facing each other, behavior problems sometimes occur during independent work
time.  Dividers may need to be used to partition the workspace.  When whole
group instruction is used, students may not all be facing the same direction.
<br>
<br>
<b>BOARDROOM STYLE</b><br>
<br>
<IMG align=center SRC="DOC73.gif"><br>
<br>
<u>Benefits</u><br>
<p>Grouping desks is sometimes necessary when classroom space is limited.
This works well when students are all working together on the same project or
when students can work well independently.<br>
<br>
<u>Problems</u><br>
<p>Like cluster style, the arrangement sometimes results in behavior
problems during independent work because students are facing each other.
Students may also have difficulty receiving individual help from the
teacher.<P>
