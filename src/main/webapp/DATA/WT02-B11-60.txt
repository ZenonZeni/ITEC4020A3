<hr><b>A vocational education and training course is a sandwich-type course in which theoretical and practical education at a vocational school alternates with practical training in a business enterprise. <br>

In Denmark, there are about 55 technical colleges and 55 business colleges. The school part of the vocational education and training courses takes place at these colleges and to a limited extent at the labour market training centres. There are moreover a number of small vocational schools offering social and health training programmes, agricultural courses etc.<br>
A typical technical vocational education and training course begins with the so-called 2nd school period, which is of 20 weeks’ duration. After the 2nd school period, there are 3-6 school periods alternating with practical training in a business enterprise</b>.<hr><br>

The commercial vocational education and training courses have a longer 2nd school period, whereas the subsequent school periods are shorter.<br>

There are approx. 85 vocational education and training courses, but as many of these courses have more than one specialisation, there are in fact a wide range of choices in the vocational education and training system.<br>

This structure guarantees multiskills with a high degree of flexibility and ability to adjust to labour market needs later on, for instance by adding new specialisations.<br>

The structure of the technical education and training courses differs from that of the commercial education and training courses. By far the longest period of technical education and training lies after the 2nd school period. This part of the course lasts between 2 and 4 years. It consists of 5-10 weeks of school-based training at a time alternating with on-the-job training periods of 6 months’ duration.
<br>
The principle behind the structure of the courses is that the students are given the same basic instruction at the beginning of the course. Subsequently, the degree of specialisation increases, the further they get in the course.
<p>
<b>Admission to Vocational Education and training</b><br>
There are normally no restrictions on admission to the vocational education and training courses. All applicants may commence on a vocational education and training course, but it is possible to restrict admission to the specialisations in those cases where the number of applicants is too great in comparison with the employment prospects. The screening will then take place at the intake to the 2nd school period.
<br>
There are several ways for students to enter a vocational education and training course. They may either start directly with the 2nd school period or with an introduction course of 5-40 weeks’ duration, the so-called 1st school period. It is also possible to start in a business enterprise with a short period of practical training followed by the 2nd school period. After the second school period, the students must go through a practical training period, which means that they have to enter into a training agreement with a business enterprise.
<p>
<b>The 1st School Period<br></b>
It is the overall aim of the first school period to make the students more confident in their choice of education, and they must therefore become familiarised with several different vocational areas during this course.
<br>
The 1st school period is voluntary. The length and the contents are flexible, which means that it may last from 5 to 40 weeks depending on the background and wishes of the students. In the technical vocational education and training area, the average duration of the 1st school period is 20 weeks.
<br>
The teaching focuses on practical tasks and workshop activities. Parallel with the teaching, the students are given a thorough orientation of the individual courses. They are informed of what is required from graduates in the individual trades and of the possibilities of further education and training within the area in question.<br>

Another advantage of the 1st school period - next to the orientation element - is that the students may start on a course, although they have not managed to get a training agreement with a business enterprise. Anyone desiring to embark on a vocational education and training course may to do so by starting with the first school period.
<br>
In the technical education and training area, there are many students over 18 years of age who are skipping the 1st school period, because they have acquired the necessary knowledge in other ways and therefore do not need the introductory school period.
<p>
<b>Practical Training<br></b>
When a student wishes to commence a course with a practical training period in a business enterprise, he must have a training agreement with the business enterprise in question. The training agreement must cover the entire course and not just the introductory practical training period.
<br>
The business enterprise commits itself contractually to train the student, and only when the contract is a reality, is it possible for the student to commence on the training course after the 2nd school period.<p>

<b>Labour Market Co-operation<br></b>
The contents and structure of vocational education and training are designed and developed in a close co-operation between the Ministry of Education and the social partners. This guarantees a dynamic development and tailoring of vocational education and training in step with the rapidly changing qualification needs of trade and industry.<br>

The co-operation is undertaken at three levels through a number of advisory bodies, on which the employers’ and employees’ organisations are equally represented.<br>

It is the task of the trade committees responsible for the individual courses to approve business enterprises as practical training places. The committees consist of an equal number of representatives from  the employers’ and employees’ organisations.<br>

In addition to being the approving bodies, the trade committees also act as advisers to business enterprises wishing to take on students for practical training. A committee may for instance find that a student employed in a highly specialised business enterprise must follow supplementary workshop training in order to obtain a broader scope in the training.<p>

<b>In-Company Training<br></b>
It is the students’ own responsibility to find a practical training place and enter into a training agreement with a business enterprise. The counselling and guidance services of the colleges do however assist the students with this.<br>

The student may carry through the whole of his practical training in one business enterprise. This has so far been the most common model in the Danish vocational education and training system. Or several companies may share one student/trainee. In that case, a combination agreement must be made from which it clearly appears which practical training periods and school periods the individual business enterprise is responsible for. This extends the possibilities of approving in particular very specialised businesses as practical training places. Young people who are unable to get a training agreement with a business enterprise get their practical training at the college. Thanks to the positive trend in the number of practical training places in trade and industry, this school-based practical training is only used by few students.<p>

<b>Assessment<br></b>
The work and performance of the students is subject to continuous assessment. The assessment may have the form of an examination or the teacher may give an assessment of the student’s performance in class. In both cases, the student is awarded a mark according to the 13-point marking scale or in some cases according to another approved marking scale.<br>

Most vocational education and training courses are completed with an examination. Dependent on the course followed, it may be in the form of a journeyman’s test, an examination or a combination of the two.<br>

The scope and contents of the examination are drawn up by the college in co-operation with the trade committees.<p>

<b>Optional Subjects<br></b>
It is the aim of the vocational education and training courses to give the students both vocational skills and general knowledge. The courses are meant to strengthen the personal development of the students and give them an understanding of the structure and development of society. Therefore, each college is committed to offer a broad range of optional subjects.<br>

It must be possible for the students to choose subjects for reasons of personal interest such as photography, but it should also be possible for them to choose subjects which prepare for an examination, i.e. subjects forming part of the leaving examinations of the Folkeskole or the upper secondary HF-examination. The optional subjects must correspond to a sixth of the total teaching time.<p>

<b>Administration<br></b>
The vocational education and training courses are administered by two sets of rules, of which one lays down the targets and framework applying to all vocational schools and all courses. These rules are defined in the Act on Vocational Education and Training, the Act on Vocational Schools and about a dozen ministerial orders which deal with the individual parts of the vocational education and training courses.<br>

The other set of rules deals with the principles of the individual courses. These rules are laid down in education orders.<br>

As a consequence of the administrative regulation of the courses, there is a free choice of college for the students and their masters. In other words, the students do not only choose the course and thereby their future job. They also have the possibility of choosing the type of teaching which suits them best.<p>

<b>Finance<br></b>
The vocational colleges receive grants from the state according to the so-called taximeter system, which means that grants are allocated on the basis of the number of students enrolled. This system implies that colleges with a great number of students enrolled will receive a big grant, whereas colleges with a dwindling number of students will receive a reduced grant.<br>

In principle, the teaching is free of charge for the students. The student receives a salary during the practical training period, and a student who commences the course with a practical training period, will receive a salary during the entire course. But students commencing the course with a school period must find other ways to cope during the first school periods. Students over 18 years of age may apply for a grant and loan from the State Education Grant and Loan Scheme. The student will receive a salary from the moment he or she commences the practical training period. <br>

Some colleges have special boarding facilities. They can be used by students who have more than 1 hour and 15 minutes’ transport from their home to the college. If there are not enough available places at these facilities, priority will be given to those students who have been admitted to courses and specialisations which do not exist in their own local area.<br>

Students pay a fixed amount for their stay at the boarding facilities. Students under 18 years of age and students with a family to support may be exempted from payment, if it is not possible for them to follow a course in their local area.<p>

<b>Related Courses<br></b>
An innovation in the Danish vocational education and training system is the system of basic social and health training programmes. The former courses for home care assistants, practical nurses, practical mental nurses, occupational counsellors and nursing home assistants have been merged into one course consisting of a basic course for health service helps and an advanced course which qualifies for positions as health service assistants.<br>

As examples of other courses offered under the auspices of the Ministry’s Department of Vocational Education and Training can be mentioned: the higher commercial examination course and the higher technical examination course which both qualify for employment as well as for admission to higher education. There are furthermore a wide range of advanced courses or diploma courses in technology, commerce and agriculture which constitute an offer for those students who wish to continue their studies on completion of the basic vocational education and training courses. <br>
