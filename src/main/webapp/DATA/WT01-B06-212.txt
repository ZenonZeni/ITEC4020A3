<P>

<P>

<P><B>While Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer proudly included on his
resume that he dug ditches when he was a teenager, the Boston-based jurist
could be more fairly characterized as a stuffed shirt.</B> <B>Justice Stephen
Breyer, appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1994 by President
Bill Clinton,</B> <B>certainly loves his shirts.  As the wealthiest justice,
worth a hefty $8.5 million, Justice Breyer can afford to</B> <B>buy nearly
anything he wants.  </B>

<P>

<P><B><I>The Washington Post </I>reported that Breyer spent $2,100 on 16
custom-made</B> <B>shirts from Ascot Chang, a Hong Kong shop that sends fitters
to you.  This is a staggering $131.25 each.</B> <B>Justice Breyer's pricey
shirts say two things about him:  he spends wildly, and more importantly,
despite his ditch-digging past, he doesn't give a damn about American blue-collar
workers.   </B>

<P>

<P><B>Justice Breyer lived in New England before his appointment to the nation's
highest court.  In nearby Waterville, Maine, the Hathaway</B> <B>Company
has been making excellent dress shirts for 159 years,  making it the oldest
shirt factory in the</B> <B>United States.  Threatened with extinction by
its owner, Hathaway could have used Justice Breyer's</B> <B>business.  (New
York-based conglomerate Warnaco, announced earlier this year that it was
closing Hathaway, but efforts are underway to keep the factory in business
under different ownership.)  Hathaway shirts sell for a mere $30 and up,
certainly within Justice Breyer's budget.</B>

<P>

<P><B>Apparently, the multimillionaire justice wanted his shirts custom-fit.
 The Custom Shirt Shop would have come to his chambers at the Supreme Court
to fit Breyer personally, carefully measuring him 13 different ways.  The
Custom Shirt Shop makes its shirts in Franklin, New Jersey, where its union
workers are paid far more than shirtmakers in Hong Kong.  Yet these American
custom-made shirts can be had for a mere $60 a pop, which would have saved
Stephen Breyer a cool $1,000.00.  The Custom Shirt Shop has several stores
in Washington, D.C. and some 70 throughout the country.</B>

<P>

<P><B>Stephen Breyer really knows how to spend a dollar, whether an American
dollar or a Hong Kong dollar.  He</B> <B>was severely criticized for approving
construction of the gold-plated $218 million courthouse in Boston. This "Taj
Mahal" on the Boston waterfront includes a $1.5 million pier and 33 kitchenettes
for the exclusive</B> <B>use of the federal judges who work in the
building.</B>

<P>

<P><B>But this article in not mainly about a free-spending Supreme Court
justice.  It is about a disloyal one.  One</B> <B>who cares more about his
shirts than his country.  One that doesn't care about the plight of American
workers</B> <B>who suffer an unemployment rate twice that found in Hong Kong.
and live on a take-home pay that hasn't</B> <B>increased in two decades.</B>

<P>

<P><B>Justice Breyer's loyalties may have been distorted by his foreign
investments and other foreign ties.  Breyer</B> <B>invested heavily in Lloyds
of London (a really bad investment) and owns real estate in London and on
the</B> <B>Caribbean isle of St. Kitts.  His wife is the daughter of a British
conservative leader.  Possibly, hobnobbing</B> <B>with the elite in Boston
and London blurred Breyer's allegiances and sensibilities.</B>

<P>

<P><B>This lack of loyalty is surprising for an Eagle Scout.  An Eagle Scout
is the highest achievement for a boy</B> <B>scout, achieved by a mere few
percent of scouts.  Most Eagle Scout's are highly loyal Americans,
including</B> <B>among their members many generals and politicians.   For
example, H. Ross Perot and Senator Sam Nunn</B> <B>were both Eagle Scouts.
 </B>

<P>

<P><B>All boy scouts take an oath of loyalty which reads: "A Scout is true
to his family, Scout leaders, friends,</B> <B>school, and nation."  Additionally,
the Scout's oath pledges the scout to "do the best to do my duty to . . .
my</B> <B>country."</B>

<P>

<P><B>I call upon Justice Breyer to unstuff his shirts, follow the scout
oath and the scout slogan to "do a good turn</B> <B>daily":  Next time you
buy shirts, or anything else, buy American.</B>
