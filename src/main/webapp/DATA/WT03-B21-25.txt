Dear Reader:<BR>
<P>
The Lockwood family has been part of the publishing industry since 1886, 
the year Henry Lockwood published the first issue of <I>Tobacco</I>.
Originally intended for the tobacco retailers in and around the Manhattan area,
<I>Tobacco</I> quickly expanded to reach the world-wide tobacco  industry.  
Continuing with that tradition, another Lockwood publication, <I>Smokeshop</I>, (which
is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary reaches tobacco retailers throughout
Northern America.

Through these two publications, we have become the respected source for thousands of cigar and tobacco retailers in America and around the world.  This year, Partegas celebrated their 150th anniversary.  We were there in our offices in pre-revolutionary Havana when they celebrated their 40th, and have been on the inside of the cigar scene ever since.
<P>
Now, in 1995, we have taken our expertise and commitment to the next logical step.  Drawing on our rich heritage of reporting on the industry, The sixth generation of the Lockwood family now brings you <B>SMOKE</B>.  This magazine not only contains intriguing, contemporary writing on cigars and pipes, but also revolves around the lifestyle of the young executives who partake in them.
<P>
We hope you will appreciate and enjoy our effort to bring the best part of the <B>SMOKE</B> world into the hands of those who most appreciate it.  You, the consumer.
