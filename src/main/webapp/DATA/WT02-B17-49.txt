<h2>Technology Demonstrations</h2>

<p>Demonstrations provide first-hand independently gathered performance data to
federal
decision-makers and support timely federal adoption of energy saving and
environmentally beneficial
technologies. Demonstrations are formalized through means such as cooperative
research and
development agreements, through which public and private collaborators share costs
and results for the
project. 

<p>A demonstration brings together a federal host site, a technology manufacturer,
a trade association, a
local utility, and a national laboratory. The federal site provides on-site support
for the technology
evaluation, hoping to reduce energy and operations and maintenance costs. The
manufacturer donates
the equipment for evaluation, hoping to establish a federal track record and
improve technologies
based on performance analysis. The local utility validates technology contributions
and helps its federal
customer offset increasing capacity requirements. Trade associations disseminate
results in order to
promote new technologies, emphasize technology transfer, and communicate technology
benefits to a
wide audience. The national laboratory provides technical staff to perform the
analysis and prepare the
technical report on the demonstration. 

<p>The Program recently finalized the results of two demonstrations: the York
Triathlon demonstration at <a href="ft_sam_houston.html"> Fort Sam Houston</a> and
the Gas-Fired Products Seahorse system at <a href="fort_stewart.html">Fort
Stewart</a>.
