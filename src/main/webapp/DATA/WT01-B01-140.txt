<B>LEGAL HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION</B><p>

Aside from murders and beatings, Russian journalists have had to contend with less dramatic  but still serious forms of intimidation, which are related to the Press Law passed under Yeltsin. Despite the media&#146;s progress in the last five years, they continue to operate in a climate where the government has the power to intervene in their work.<p>

In accordance with the Press Law, the State Inspectorate for Defense of Freedom of the Press and Mass Information (previously known as Glavlit, the state censorship agency) operates under the Russian federal government&#146;s Committee for the Press. The Inspectorate, which has branches in provincial cities, is empowered to give warnings to media outlets that allegedly violate the law. In addition, every regional administration (i.e., provincial government) in Russia has a Committee for the Media that can decide matters relevant to funding and news content. The Glasnost Defense Foundation has documented numerous incidents where inspectorates in the provinces violated procedure when attempting to enforce press regulations.<p>

<B>Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes: 
Government Enforcer of "Balance"</B><p>

In an ostensible effort to mediate the numerous conflicts that arise with the emergence of a free press, the Arbitration Information Court was formed in 1993. The "court"--an ad hoc, extrajudicial body of prominent legal scholars and media professionals--was given a mandate to "secure equal access to the mass media for all participants in the electoral process and to bring about functional solutions to disputes and conflicts arising in this regard," as one of its members, lawyer Viktor Monakhov, wrote in <CITE>Sreda</CITE> [Medium] in March 1996. At first, the "court" was viewed as a positive but temporary effort by the reform elements of the government to handle controversial questions like the granting of air time to political parties during the 1993 parliamentary elections. The organization was subsequently renamed the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes and placed under the administration of the Russian president. The Judicial Chamber was then given a permanent mandate to enforce "balanced" coverage of controversial issues and legal measures regarding inflammatory content. <p>

Some journalists and other independent observers soon began to express doubts about the increasing influence of the extra-judicial body on press issues. Writing in the <CITE>Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal</CITE> (vol. 13, no. 3, 1995), Jamey Gambrell commented: "While in theory it is an innovative and needed institution, and indeed served a fruitful purpose during the December [1993] elections, it has insufficient legal status to enforce its decisions, and its actual effect on journalistic practice is so far unclear."<p>

Several journalists writing on controversial issues have found that the Judicial Chamber plays a negative role:<p>

<ul><li><B>Svetlana Alexeyich</B>, a Belarus journalist noted for her critical coverage of the Afghanistan war and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, frequently contributes to <CITE>Izvestia</CITE> because she is often unable to publish in her own country. Alexeyich told CPJ on April 26, 1996, that she had been notified by the Judicial Chamber of the need to address a problem of "imbalance" that resulted from what was seen as her one-sided portrayal in <CITE>Izvestia</CITE> of the partisan movement in Belarus during World War II. Izvestia was then ordered to carry material with the partisan veterans&#146; point of view. A protest statement signed by the veterans was run in the May 5 issue of <CITE>Izvestia</CITE> with an editorial comment that the group had appealed to the Judicial Chamber and "had the right to its own truth."<p>

<li>In 1993, <B>Yaroslav Mogutin,</B> one of the country&#146;s few openly gay journalists, was arrested, held overnight in jail, and charged with "hooliganism" for using profane language in an interview with a prominent gay dancer that was published in <CITE>Novy Vzglyad</CITE>, a weekly nationalist newspaper distributed as a supplement to <CITE>Moskovskaya Pravda.</CITE> Charges were also filed against the weekly, even though the use of profane language had become quite common in many papers, including the high-circulation <CITE>Moskovsky Komsomolets</CITE>. The case was eventually dropped, but not before Mogutin and his partner were harassed by local policemen who would repeatedly come to their apartment in the middle of the night to extort money, threatening the couple with criminal prosecution if they did not comply. In 1995, after Mogutin published an article on the war in Chechnya in the January issue of <CITE>Novy Vzglyad</CITE>, the Judicial Chamber held two hearings on his writings and accused Mogutin of violating Article 74-1 of the Penal Code, which calls for a prison term of up to 7 years for "incitement of ethnic hatred, corruption of public morals and defamation of the Motherland." The Chamber recommended that the state shut down <CITE>Novy Vzglyad</CITE>, revoke its publishing license, and launch a criminal case against Mogutin. Based on this recommendation, the prosecutor&#146;s office opened an investigation against him in April 1995. As a result of the continuing harassment, Mogutin went to the United States to seek asylum.</ul><p>

Independent journalists pointed out in regard to the 1995 case involving Mogutin that although at least 50 openly fascist journalists are allowed to publish in Russia--some tied to armed extremist groups--the Judicial Chamber had not moved against them, nor had the Russian courts, with the exception of four cases in the last two years, two of which follow:<p>

<ul><li>In 1994, the Chamber had concluded that the virulently nationalist and anti-Semitic newspaper <CITE>Kolokol</CITE> [The Bell], which supports Zyuganov&#146;s candidacy, was inciting ethnic intolerance in violation of the constitution and the Press Law, although nothing came of its recommendations to local authorities to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. The central district court in Volgograd, where the paper is published, had earlier ruled in favor of the Union of the Russian People, the organization that publishes <CITE>Kolokol</CITE> and which sued another local paper, Gorodskiye Vesti, for slander when it carried criticism of the extremist group. The court ordered that <CITE>Gorodskiye Vesti</CITE> print a retraction and acknowledge that its characterization of the group was "incorrect." Editor in chief Anatoly Karman told Izvestia, "The very fact that the suit of the Black Hundreds was won can only be viewed as a form of insurance [by the local government]. What if [the nationalists] really come to power as they say they will ?"<p>

<li>In April 1996, prompted by complaints from the Russian Union of Journalists and the parliament&#146;s Committee on the Press, the Judicial Chamber decided to go after the notorious figure <B>Eduard Limonov</B>, publisher of <CITE>Limonka</CITE> (circ. 6,000-8,000). The Judicial Chamber charged him with violating "international and Russian law, and Article 4 of the Law on the Mass Media, which prohibits the propagandizing of mass terror and hatred, and the damaging of Russia&#146;s international reputation." They sent a recommendation to the Moscow city prosecutor&#146;s office, which will determine whether to prosecute Limonov for "incitement of ethnic hatred" under Article 74-1. On March 2, 1996, Novy Vzglyad reprinted material that Limonov had published in Limonka in 1995 which claimed that Stalin&#146;s brutal deportation in World War II of entire peoples, like the Chechens, were "actions of justified prevention" and that, regrettably, "he didn&#146;t finish the job." The Judicial Chamber did not accept Limonov&#146;s defense that he was reacting emotionally to the Chechen hostage-taking crisis in Budyonnovsk. In explaining their ruling, experts summoned to the hearing found that "the actions of individual criminals should not be ascribed to the entire nation." The Judicial Chamber recommended that The Russian Federation Committee for the Press, the government press regulation body, give Limonka an official warning. (After two such warnings the paper could lose its registration status, i.e., its license to publish.) Limonov is also being investigated by the prosecutor general&#146;s office in Ukraine for calling for a "violation of territorial integrity" by urging that the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol be annexed to Russia.</ul><p>

CPJ does not take a position on the content of these papers, but we note that we do not defend persons whose writings explicitly advocate violence. The point here is to illustrate the troublesome nature of the Chamber as an extrajudicial but extremely influential body that may not work in favor of press freedom in every instance. Provincial journalists, however, have welcomed the Chamber&#146;s extensive intervention in disputes between repressive local governments and struggling independent media. Still, the continued existence of this body is largely a function of the weakness of the unreformed judicial system and the complexities inevitably introduced by the government&#146;s attempts to enforce extensive, intrusive, and often ill-defined press laws.<p>

<B>Libel Suits</B><p>

As in many countries dealing with an emerging free press, libel suits are clogging the Russian courts. When public figures--many of them die-hard nationalists or Communists--are angered by the media&#146;s unfavorable portrayal of them, they appeal to the courts for defense of their "honor and dignity." Several leading newspapers are fighting slander suits on behalf of their correspondents, but they have not been very public about their struggles. Slander accusations and suits clearly bedevil many journalists and are so much a part of their working lives that they rarely bother to complain about them as any kind of "pressure" or "harassment." But it is clear that they are a significant drain on their time and resources, and ultimately these cases may have the effect of curbing journalists&#146; frank characterizations of odious figures. Even providing a forum for critical comments made by prominent figures, such as reform economist Yegor Gaidar or former Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, can land a newspaper or TV station in court on charges of slander. Both Gaidar and Kozyrev have lost libel suits and been compelled to publish retractions to their comments in newspaper articles and television interviews.<p>

Although in most instances journalists are forced to react to accusations of defamation from various political figures, ranging from Yeltsin to extremist Vladimir Zhironovsky, at least one editor attempted to turn the tables. 

<ul><li>Globus Syndicate reported in <CITE>V zashchitu Svobody Slova</CITE> (no. 9/96) that in September 1995, <B>Kronid Lubarsky</B>, deputy editor of the weekly magazine <CITE>Novoye Vremya</CITE>, sued the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, in defense of his "honor and dignity." The suit was brought in response to comments made by Stanislav Govorukhin, head of a parliamentary commission investigating the Chechen war. Govorukhin claimed that the mass media had "launched a colossal disinformation campaign" inspired by Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, who, Govorukhin alleged, had paid large sums of money to a number of journalists, including Lubarsky. To prove that his sole desire in bringing suit was to set the record straight, Lubarsky set the amount for damages at one ruble.<p>

Since the parliament as a body cannot be sued under Russian law, Lubarsky was then forced to sue Govorukhin personally in the district where the parliamentarian resides. The Gagarin District Court repeatedly postponed the hearing, most recently until June 17, the day after the Russian elections, apparently wishing to determine first how the political winds will blow. On the advice of his lawyer, Lubarsky also tried to sue the other members of the Govorukhin Commission for "inaction" in setting the record straight, but the Supreme Court ruled that while unlawful acts of the government can be appealed, "inaction" by such bodies could not be the subject of a suit. Lubarsky appealed to the chairman of the Supreme Court to review the handling of his complaint, but sadly, the journalist died in May of a heart attack at the age of 61 before his case could be heard.
