<b>Project Summary</b>

<p>The Vermont Gasifier project is part of a major U.S. Department 
of Energy (DOE) initiative to demonstrate gasification of 
renewable biomass for electricity production.  The Vermont Project 
has been undertaken to demonstrate the integration of the Battelle 
Columbus Laboratories (Battelle) "indirect" gasifier with a 
high-efficiency gas turbine.  The demonstration and validation of 
this gasification/gas turbine system is being undertaken at the 
existing 50 megawatt wood-fired McNeil Power Generating Station in 
Burlington, Vermont, thereby significantly reducing the time-scale 
for deployment and the necessary capital investment for DOE and the 
Vermont project partnership.  The development and 
commercialization of this technology is important for several 
reasons:

<p>1)  It does not require a hot-gas cleanup for gas turbine 
operation, thus removing this technical hurdle from the 
commercialization path;

<p>2) It is the only biomass gasification system in the world that 
has successfully powered a gas turbine, proving its near-term 
viability for commercial deployment; and

<p>3) It produces a higher BTU gas stream than other gasification 
systems, thus allowing the use of exising unmodified industrial 
gas turbines.

<p><b>FY 1996 Products</b>

<p>The project's detailed design will be completed and construction 
will be initiated on a 15 megawatt installation that will 
complement the existing 50 megawatt output of McNeil Station.

<p><b>Payoffs</b>

<p>Demonstration of this U.S. technology at a utility power 
station will significantly buy-down the perceived risk among 
domestic and international power project developers.  It will also 
provide significant market opportunities for advanced-cycle, 
high-efficiency biomass power generation systems for application 
in domestic and international markets.  Successful demonstration 
will provide substantial market pull for U.S. biomass gasification 
technologies, and provide a significant market edge over competing 
foreign technologies.

<p><b>Status</b>

<p>Currently, Zurn Nepco, an engineering company with extensive 
experience in the design and construction of biomass-fired power 
plants, is preparing the detailed engineering design and is 
completing the permitting process for the start of construction, 
which is scheduled for late 1995.  Operation and debugging of the 
gasifier component is forecast for 1996, and the addition of the 
gas turbine is forecast for 1997.

<p><b>Partners and Cost Share</b>

<p>The Vermont Project is a scale-up of an indirect gasifier 
concept developed by Battelle, which is based in Columbus, Ohio.  
The principal industrial partner, Future Energy Resources Company 
(FERCO), of Atlanta, Georgia, is cost-sharing 50% of the overall 
project costs with DOE.  Other project participants include the 
co-owners of the McNeil generating station located in Burlington, 
Vermont, which is operated by the Burlington Electric Department, 
and Zurn Nepco, of Portland, Maine.

<p><b>Related Programs</b>

<p>This project parallels the Hawaii Biomass Gasifier Facility 
project in many respects.  The Battelle indirect gasifier 
technology to be used in the Vermont project features several 
innovations that may offer advantages over air/oxygen blown 
gasification systems.  One advantage is that it generates a 
fuel-gas that is free of atmospheric nitrogen, which makes it 
capable of easy catalytic cleanup prior to either combustion or 
use in the chemical synthesis of methanol, a future automobile 
fuel.  The product gas has about half the heating value of natural 
gas, unlike other air-blown gasifiers that produce a biogas with a 
much lower heating value.  As a consequence, existing gas turbines 
can be used with this fuel-gas without modification.

<p>DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies operates the 
Biofuels Development Program that is developing liquid fuels from 
biomass through gasification technologies, with a strong emphasis 
on the use of biotechnology to produce ethanol from 
lignocellulosics (such as woody or grassy materials).  As such, 
the technology development and validation to be accomplished under 
this program directly benefits DOE's Biofuels Program as well.

<p><b>Vulnerabilities and Issues</b>

<p>The major vulnerability concerns the worldwide competition for 
biomass gasification technologies.  Currently, there are several 
biomass gasification commercialization activities underway in 
North America, Brazil, and Scandinavia.  Two promonent 
international developments (the World Bank's Global Environmental 
Facility Gasifier Project in Brazil, and the Varnarmo Bioflo 
project in Sweden) indicate the European biomass gasification 
technologies are  also close to commercial demonstration, which 
could provide direct international competition for this developing 
market.  It is critical that U.S. tehcnologies not lose out to 
foreign interests in this vast arena of market opportunity.  
Accordingly, further development, demonstration, and deployment of 
this technology could be jeopardized should funding for this 
Biomass Power project be reduced.
