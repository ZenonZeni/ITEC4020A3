<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>One key to antiaging may lie in shoring up your bodies supply of essential 
longevity hormones called melatonin and DHEA.</CENTER></H3>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Melatonin: 
<BR>Unlocking the Fountain of Youth in Your Forehead</CENTER></H2>

There's a new way of thinking about aging and illness, states Dr. Block, who directs
the Rhinebeck Medical Center in New York State. That's melatonin, a vitally important
hormone produced by the pineal gland deep in every human brain. The pineal gland is
&quot;the biological clock that controls aging&quot; and sets the rhythm for every aspect of
your body. Like other hormonal substances such as DHEA and Human Growth Hormone (also
discussed in this Digest), body supplies of melatonin, central to most body
functions, measurably decline as you age. This decline itself, says Dr. Block, may be
a cause of aging.

<P>Melatonin is one of the body's most powerful antioxidants, preventing age-related
cellular damage caused by free radicals. As you age and body production of melatonin
declines, you become more susceptible to all the illnesses associated with aging,
including cancer, heart disease, and immune dysfunction. In fact, &quot;many, if not most,
of such age-related health problems are caused by declining levels of melatonin,&quot; Dr.
Block claims.

<P>You can use melatonin as a natural sleeping pill; to ease PMS symptoms; to stimulate
the immune system; to prevent memory loss, hardening of the arteries, and stroke; and
to treat cancer and Alzheimer's, says Dr. Block. By resetting your body clock, which
runs on melatonin, you can begin to reverse the effects of aging. 

<P>How melatonin-friendly is your lifestyle? If you suffer from these symptoms, you may
have melatonin deprivation: chronic illness, difficulty concentrating, frequent colds
and viruses, memory or mood disturbances (depression, mood swings), feeling sleepy
during the day, awake at night, strange changes in sleep and activity cycles.

<UL>Here's how to get more antiaging melatonin into your life, according to Dr. Block:

<LI><B>Take melatonin supplements.</B> Start with a once-daily dosage of 2-3 mg, taken in the
evening but before you sleep. Build to higher doses gradually, as they may produce
drowsiness.
 
<LI><B>Boost your antioxidants intake.</B> Adequate levels of other antioxidants such as
vitamins E, C, beta-carotene, A, and selenium enhance the activity of melatonin.
 
<LI><B>Feed your immune system.</B> A strong immune system supports melatonin's ability to
disarm infections. Take extra amounts of vitamin B6, zinc, copper, tryptophan.
 
<LI><B>Adjust your diet and lifestyle.</B> Limit your calorie intake; eat regular meals;
don't overeat in the evening; avoid stimulants such as chocolate, coffee, sodas,
medications containing caffeine; don't smoke; take iron supplements sparingly; avoid
pollutants, radiation, electromagnetic field and chemical exposures; and get more
sunlight into your life.</UL>

<HR><A NAME="DHEA"> </A>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>DHEA:
The Mother of all Hormones </CENTER></H2>
DHEA is a natural hormone produced in the adrenal glands. In fact, it is the most
abundant hormone found in the human bloodstream-that is, until the normal course
of aging depletes it dramatically. 

<P>If you live to be 80, your body will probably have only 10-20% of the DHEA it had
when you were 20 years old. This can leave you vulnerable to breast, prostate, and
bladder cancer, atherosclerotic plaque, nerve degeneration, and other age-related
conditions. 

<P>On the positive side, if you shore up your system's dwindling reserves of DHEA,
medical research indicates that this can help prevent these conditions and improve
memory, treat lupus and osteoporosis in women, even prevent diabetes, Parkinson's,
and Alzheimer's.
<A NAME="estro"> </A>
<P>DHEA is called the &quot;mother of all hormones&quot; because not only does it have many
functions in the body pertaining to health and longevity, but it is the substance
from which other important hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, and
testosterone, are made. The important idea here is that the evidence (4000 medical
papers, so far) strongly suggests that DHEA hormone replacement therapy can work
wonders for your health as you age. 
<A NAME="WEIGHT"> </A>
<P>A landmark study in 1986 of 242 men, aged 50-79, based on 12 years of research,
stated that a small supplementation of DHEA (100 mcg/ml) corresponded to a 48%
reduction in death from heart disease and a 36% reduction in death from any cause,
other than accidents. A Temple University medical researcher reports that DHEA can
help you lose weight by blocking an enzyme known to produce fat tissue and promote
cancer cell growth. In one 28 day study, DHEA supplementation enabled men to lose 31%
of mean body fat with no change in body weight. 

<P>Another study involving 16 middle-aged to elderly men showed that taking DHEA for 1
year led to a 75% increase in their sense of overall well-being. The men said they
coped better with stress, felt more physically mobile, and slept better.

<P>Because laboratory studies in animals show that DHEA can increase life span by 50%,
scientists believe DHEA replacement therapy can have a life-extending effect on
humans. Other studies suggest that  DHEA enhances the activity of the immune system,
enabling it to better protect the body from viruses and bacteria, including HIV and
EBV (associated with chronic fatigue syndrome).

<BLOCKQUOTE>DHEA is naturally available in the Mexican Yam (also called Wild Yam or Dioscorea
villisa L.) Technically, this  vegetable contains the nutritional precursors from
which the body produces DHEA. You can also find DHEA in a prepared supplement called
Endogen<FONT SIZE=-2>[TM]</FONT>, which costs about $27 for a month's supply of 90 tablets. Actual dosages
will vary with the individual or according to a physician's prescription, but the
range is typically  50 mg to 3000 mg/day per person. For more information,

<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTION!</FONT> Some physicians, including cardiologist William Lee Cowden, M.D., caution that if you
take too much DHEA, it will suppress your body¹s natural ability to synthesize it.
Therefore, Dr. Cowden recommends taking DHEA every second day, alternating this with
sources of DHEA-precursors, such as wild yarn.
