<h2>VII. MARIJUANA USERS IN THE COURTS: 1930-1965</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having studied the evolution of legislative hostility to
marijuana from a regional phenomenon with racial overtones to a
nationwide paranoia, it is worthwhile to consider the fate of
marijuana users in the courts during this evolutionary period.
After the courts had summarily rejected the substantive
constitutional arguments, appeals in marijuana cases tended to
focus on three contentions particularly germane to drug
violations: procedural objections arising from interrelated
statutory schemes on the state and federal levels punishing
essentially the same conduct; objections to police conduct
intrinsic to victimless crimes; and objections to sufficiency of
evidence at trial. Like their legislative colleagues, state and
federal translated what they knew of the drug's mythical effects
into overt hostility. Coupled with the traditionally conservative
treatment afforded the rights of criminal defendants, especially
in state prosecutions, this judicial hostility produced
ever-lengthening sentences and few reversals. </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>A. Statutory Fantasies: The Complications of
Federal Legislation</b></font> </p>

<p><b>1. Quadruple &quot;Jeopardy&quot; and the &quot;Killer
Weed&quot;</b> </p>

<p>When Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937, marijuana
had already been included in the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and
every state had enacted some form of marijuana prohibition.1 In
addition to its ostensible revenue-raising function, the Act was
obviously designed both to deter further use of the drug 2 and to
facilitate enforcement of the state laws.3 The statute assured
the availability to state prosecutors of the order forms filed
with the IRS at the time of payment of the tax. 4 Congress had
thought that the order forms and registration requirements would
develop an &quot;adequate means of publicizing dealings in
marihuana in order to tax and control the traffic
effectively.&quot;5 </p>

<p>Thus, after 1937, possession of marijuana without filing the
transfer form and paying the federal tax constituted a violation
of both state and federal law;- yet filing the form and paying
the tax would probably not have eliminated the buyer's exposure
to prosecution under state law. Indeed, compliance would probably
have readily identified the buyer to state officials. To this
unfairness the courts paid no heed, noting that exposure to state
and federal prosecution for the same act did not constitute
double jeopardy7 and that the fifth amendment did not protect
defendants from prosecution for violation of state law.8 </p>

<p>After passage of the 1956 federal narcotic drug legislation9
possession of marijuana constituted at least one, and often two,
additional crimes. First, the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export
Act was amended10 in 1956 to punish directly illegal
importation11 of marijuana or other dealings in the drug with
knowledge that it had been illegally imported. Since mere
possession was sufficient evidence to convict under the Act, 12
possession without registration and order form now constituted
three crimes, and compliance with the filing and tax provisions
would have exposed the defendant to liability under state law and
under the importation provision if the original importation was
illegal. Again the courts saw no fifth amendment violation.13
Second, another provision of the 1956 package required every
person addicted to or using narcotics or convicted of a violation
of the narcotics or marijuana laws punishable by over one year's
imprisonment to register upon leaving the country. 14 Designed to
aid the Government in identifying potential smugglers. the
statute was upheld, as a strict liability offense, 15 against a
multitude of constitutional challenges. 16 Since penalties for
marijuana possession almost uniformly exceeded one year's
imprisonment during this period, a first offense possession
conviction by either sovereign triggered the registration
provision. </p>

<p><b>2. Statutory Presumptions</b> </p>

<p>Because the federal statutes punished sale and possession of
marijuana only indirectly, each had to bridge the gap between
those acts and the technical crimes-tax violations and
importation-related acts. As a bootstrap from the federal taxing
power to a federal police power, Congress chose presumptions.
Thus, under the Marihuana Tax Act, possession plus failure to
produce the required forms was presumptive evidence of the
criminal act-failure to pay the tax17 -and the courts had no
trouble upholding this provision. 18 In addition, under the
Import and Export Act possession of marijuana constituted
presumptive evidence of illegal importation and of defendant's
knowledge of such importation.19 </p>

<p>Against a rash of attacks on the rationality of this
presumption, the lower federal courts20 noted that the Supreme
Court had upheld the same statutory language in the original
Federal Import and Export Act with respect to opium 21 and that
there was sufficient general knowledge that most marijuana was
imported from Mexico to make the presumption rational. Although
the Ninth Circuit at one time indicated that a defendant could
rebut the presumption by showing that the marijuana in his
possession was manicured and therefore more likely to have been
domestically grown,22 that court later held that such proof was
insufficient and that the defendant must also show actual
domestic production. 23 </p>

<p><b>B. Attacks on State Legislation</b> </p>

<p>Most attacks on the state statutes focused on the vagueness of
statutory terms-marijuana, however spelled, or cannabis or Indian
Hemp24 -both as a scientific matter and in terms of common
experience.25 Predictably, however, few state courts were of a
mind to inhibit legislative proscription of the &quot;killer
weed.&quot; Due in part to greatly exaggerated conceptions about
the effects of the drug26 and in part to the ease with which the
mature plant is processed for the outlawed purposes,27 the courts
construed these statutory definitions as broadly as possible 28
despite the traditional rule of strict construction of criminal
statutes. </p>

<p>With the progressive increase in the severity of penalties
which accompanied adoption of the Uniform Act in the 1930's and
1940's and the surge of amendments in the 1950's in the wake of
the Boggs Act.29 Some problems of application arose.
Interestingly enough. some courts, applied the lesser penalty
where one of two penalties could be imposed.30 Similarly many
courts tended to impose minimum sentences until the late 1950's
when they , too, lost all sense of proportion.31 </p>

<p><b>C. Procedural Defenses and Entrapment</b> </p>

<p>Statutory attacks during this period tended to reflect the
complicated interrelation of state and federal law and the
scientific imprecision of legislative drafting. These attacks
were usually rebuffed, and defendants, caught in a squeeze of
judicial and legislative hostility, had few, if any, viable
defenses based on whether or not they had violated the regulatory
scheme. Both state and federal statutes merely required the
prosecution to prove that the particular defendant was found in
possession of a substance which when chemically tested was found
to be marijuana. There were few tricky problems of proof, and the
prosecution usually had a clear case. If these offenders were
caught dead to rights on the merits, the energetic attorney had
to look elsewhere for his defense. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the exigencies of police practice in the field of
narcotics law enforcement provided a defendant's attorney with a
new area of attack-procedural irregularities in the arrest and
apprehension of his client. The possession and sale of marijuana
epitomize the crime without a victim; neither seller nor buyer is
apt to complain of the transaction. In order to promote vigorous
law enforcement in this area, the police have had to use a series
of undercover agents, surprise raids and often questionable
search and arrest techniques. Because of the nature of the
conduct they are trying to stifle, the police must intrude into a
private social relationship where none of the parties wants it-
thus, the police have found it essential to employ highly
secretive and often patently deceitful practices. It is no
coincidence that the vast developments in the law of criminal
procedure-especially in the fourth amendment area-have been
outgrowths primarily of narcotics and marijuana cases. </p>

<p><b>1. Search and Seizure</b> </p>

<p>Today the major remedy for an illegal search is exclusion of
the seized items as evidence. Some states and the federal courts
have used this exclusionary rule since early in the twentieth
century. However, before the 1961 decision in Mapp v. 0hio32
required all states to adopt this remedy, many state courts did
not exclude illegally seized evidence. In jurisdictions without
the rule, it scarcely helped the victim of an illegal search to
raise the point. So, for example, in a 1945 Louisiana case, the
court permitted introduction of marijuana seized without a
warrant from defendant's room while he was out of town .33 </p>

<p>Because of the scope permitted the searching officer, things
were not much better in jurisdictions adhering to the
exclusionary rule. In states using the rule before Mapp, the
crucial issue when the lawfulness of a search was questioned was
whether or not the search was reasonable under the
circumstances.34 One might expect, in view of the judicial
hostility toward marijuana defendants, that the reasonableness
standard provided sufficient leeway for circumvention of the
exclusionary rule in more than a few cases.35 Other end runs
around the rule were developed in the federal system and in the
states purporting to apply the rule to evidence seized in an
illegal search. First, courts upheld searches if there was
arguably an untainted source for seizure of the evidence. For
example, a court might admit marijuana seized in a concededly
illegal search where a police officer saw the marijuana before
beginning the illegal search .36 Second, in order to have
standing to assert the inadmissibility of seized items, one had
to admit the narcotics in question belonged to hirn.37 Third,
courts often permitted searches pursuant to a warrant to extend
far beyond the items named in the warrant 38 under what came to
be known as the contraband theory. This theory reasoned that
certain items could never lawfully be possessed and belonged only
to the government; thus any seizure of these items was
permissible.39 </p>

<p><b>2. Entrapment</b> </p>

<p>In order for federal and state agents to detect narcotics
traffic and use, it is essential that they infiltrate the drug
culture. Obtaining this inside information may often involve
police use of special employees - informers-or may require that
the police become directly involved in the commission of the
criminal act .40 Many defendants in narcotics cases have claimed
that they were forced into sales or purchases of narcotics by the
police or their agents. These charges led to the affirmative
defense of entrapment, first recognized in federal courts by the
Supreme Court in Sorrels v. United States.41 Since that time, the
principles of the defense, as stated in that decision, were
reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Sherman v. United States .42
In Sherman, a government informer induced the defendant, who was
trying to quit his use of narcotics and was undergoing treatment
at a narcotics rehabilitation center, to resume his use and
supply the informer. The Court held that the conduct of the
police informer constituted entrapment. </p>

<p>The entrapment defense would seem the ideal defense tactic in
marijuana cases, because so often the defendant has been
apprehended due to some police informer or police trick .43
However, the theoretical and practical outlines of the defense
narrowly restrict its scope and make it rarely successful.
Moreover, because it may entail an admission that defendant
committed the act charged 44 it is usually the last resort. </p>

<p>From the beginning there have been two conflicting views of
the entrapment defense. The majority view has considered
entrapment an exception to the given criminal statute on the
ground that the legislature could not have intended entrapment to
fall within the statutory definitions of the crime. With this as
the theoretical justification of the defense, the inquiry focuses
on the innocence of the defendant but for the police conduct. The
practical question is whether the police merely supplied an
opportunity for a person with a preexisting prediliction to the
criminal act. In the majority view this question of fact is to be
resolved by the jury. 45 </p>

<p>Throughout the years a substantial minority position has
contended that the entrapment defense should be considered a
police control mechanism. Under this view, the focus is on the
police and their conduct rather than on the character of the
defendant. This rationale is premised on the court's supervisory
powers over tile administration of justice, and the question of
entrapment is one of law to be decided by the not by the jury.46 </p>

<p>The focus of the defense on the character of the defendant and
the use of usually unsympathetic juries to decide the issue have
greatly hindered the successfulness of the entrapment defense.
Since the defense must be raised affirmatively, the defendant
bears a heavy burden in proving that he would not have committed
the crime but for the police inducement. Thus, in Gilmore v.
United States47 the defendant was unable to carry the burden of
proving that he would not have otherwise committed the marijuana
offense. A government agent approached the defendant and
requested marijuana, but the jury found no entrapment and the
court could not declare that there was entrapment as a matter of
law. </p>

<p>With the entrapment defense, as with illegal searches, the
court has a known lawbreaker before it and for this reason is
reluctant to free him unless there is an overwhelming reason to
dismiss the charges, As a California court stated, It is not the
entrapment of a criminal upon which the law frowns . . . . &quot;
48 The focus upon the defendant and his mental state, rather than
a focus on the government enforcement practices and their
possible effect of creating a particular crime, places an
incredible burden on the defendant to try to convince the jury
that he is otherwise blameless. The use of informers and special
agents who become friendly with those suspected of dealing in
marijuana, and the use of this friendship to try to purchase
marijuana, often by supplying the cash,49 are bound to have a
detrimental effect on the lay enforcement officers as well as to
assure a slight increase in the supply of marijuana which would
otherwise not have entered the trade. Nevertheless, the defense
as presently structured remains virtually impossible for the
defendant to raise with any real hope of success.<br>
</p>

<p><b>D. The Pro Forma Trial<br>
</b></p>

<p>When the marijuana defendant had exhausted his motions for
dismissal or suppression of the evidence and was brought to
trial, he was usually in deep trouble, faced with judicial
hostility, lax methods of identification, and loose standards of
proof. Convictions were rarely reversed for any reason and
especially not for insufficient evidence. And penalties, no
matter how harsh, were never set aside. </p>

<p>The first line of defense in the marijuana trial often
involved the defendant's claim that the substance seized from him
was not really marijuana. In general, the state had no difficulty
proving the substance to be marijuana. In the important case,
expert evidence of chemical tests may have been introduced,50 but
more commonly courts permitted the testimony of police
officers,51 undercover agents and other lay witnesses52 to be
sufficient to create a question of fact for the jury to decide.
53 Thus, when chemical evidence was not introduced, juries were
strongly inclined to believe the policeman or a disinterested
prosecution witness as against the defendant.54 </p>

<p>This ease of identification combined with the uncritical
acceptance of uncorroborated testiniony,55 produced what amounted
in fact to a very low standard of proof. Thus, in a California
case, People v. Janisse,56 the conviction was upheld on the
testimony of teenage boys, though the defendant's co-workers
testified for an alibi. The evidence of rookie police officers
who later failed their civil service exams57 has been accepted
over the word of the defendant. Finally, even the testimony of
witnesses who stand to benefit only from the conviction of the
defendant has been accepted without corroboration, whether the
benefit was indirect58 or direct.59 The wisdom of allowing such
testimony by itself to be legally sufficient for a conviction is
doubtful. </p>

<p>Although in theory the state must prove the defendant's
possession was knowing,60 through the use of circumstantial
evidence the state usually encountered few problems in meeting
its burden of proof. The state was permitted to use
circumstantial evidence to link the defendant to a quantity of
marijuana, but where only circumstantial evidence existed there
must have been an instruction to the that all other reasonable
inferences of innocence had been overcome.61 For example,
behavior such as running away from police, if marijuana was found
along the path run, was sufficient to link the defendant to
possession 62 though mere proximity without other guilty behavior
was not enough to prove possession. 63 </p>

<p>Finally, judicial hostility to the &quot;morally
depraved&quot; marijuana user was so strong that often judges
condoned inflammatory statements by the prosecution to the jury
about the nature of the drug and its users. Indeed, some judges
themselves often participated in these highly emotional
statements. For example, one judge in instructing a jury
announced: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana is a vicious, demoralizing substance that robs a
    person of morality honor, integrity, decency, and all the
    virtues that are the foundation of good character and good
    citizenship. The Government is constantly engaged in an
    effort to stamp out traffic in this and in narcotic drugs.
    Officers of the Government are employed in this effort
    usually and are entitled to credit for their loyalty and
    integrity.64<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same way, direct aspersions toward a defendant's
character were tolerated .65 For instance, courts overlooked
prosecution comments that the defendant sold his drugs near a
'junior high school&quot; or that drug use among teenagers must
be stopped .66 </p>

<p>In sum, then, defendants in marijuana cases had great
difficulties at trial during this period. Easy identification
methods, jury acceptance of uncorroborated testimony, use of
circumstantial evidence to prove defendant's possession was
knowing, and the 'judicial participation in inflammatory
statements to the jury made defense success at trial a virtual
impossibility.<br>

<p>5 With minor exceptions, the Marihuana Tax Act requires all
transactions in marijuana to be carried out by written order
form. 26 U.S.C. §§ 4741-44 (1964). It is unlawful for a
transferor to transfer except by such form obtained by the
transferee, 26 U.S.C. S 4742 (1964), and for the transferee to
acquire, transport or conceal marijuana without filing the
transfer form, registering with the IRS and paying the applicable
transfer tax. 26 U.S.C. § 4744 (a) (1964). For heretofore
unregistered persons, that tax is $100 an ounce. 26 U.S.C. §
4741 (1964). Since marijuana was excised from the United States
Pharmacopoeia, there have been few legitimate transactions by
registered persons. THE PRESIDENTS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, REPORT: THE CHALLENGE OF CRIME IN
A FREE SOCIETY 214 (1967). Since .the tax is otherwise
prohibitive, the Act is in effect almost entirely a criminal law;
the crime is having anything to do with marijuana-possession,
sale, acquisition or importation-since proof of possession
coupled with failure, after reasonable notice and demand by the
Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, to produce the
transfer form is &quot;presumptive evidence&quot; of guilt. 26

<p>15 Application of the statute was particularly harsh. Even
though defendant, found guilty of a drug offense and sent to the
California Youth Authority for several months, had been told upon
release that his record was clean, the court held that he had
violated the statute by failing to register. Adams v. United
States, 299 F.2d 327 (9th Cir. 1962). </p>

States v. Eramdjian, 155 F. Supp. 914 (S.D. Cal. 1957). The
courts struggled mightily with arbitrariness, vagueness, right to
travel, self incrimination, and equal protection arguments, but
upheld the statute. But cf. Russell v. United States, 306 F.2d
402 (9th Cir. 1962) (gun registration requirement

importation was a rule of evidence, not of substantive law, the
court noted that imported marijuana was ordinarily composed of
mixed twigs and stems since the growers waited until maturity
before harvesting. In the United States, on the other hand,
growers avoided police detection by picking individual leaves
before the plant matured, Since appellant possessed mixed twigs
and stems, the court upheld application of the presumption; the
clear suggestion, however, was that the presumption would not be
applied to manicured marijuana. </p>

cert. denied, 376 U.S. 930 (1964). </p>

<p>24 Use of the Latin word &quot;cannabis&quot; was challenged
as an unconstitutionally vague definition of the prohibited
substance in People v. Oliver, 66 Cal. App. 2d 431, 152 P.2d 329
(Dist. Ct. App. 1944), on the basis of an early holding that the
use of Latin to define a sex crime was unconstitutionally vague,
Ex parte Lockett, 179 Cal. 581, 178 P. 134 (1919) (fellatio and
cunnilingus). -In rejecting the vagueness argument, the court
held that &quot;cannabis&quot; was later explained in the statute
by the use of the word &quot;marijuana&quot; and that the two
words were synonymous. See People v. Martinez, 117 Cal. App. 2d
701, 256 P.2d 1028 (Dist. Ct. App. 1953) (&quot;Indian Hemp&quot;
not unconstitutionally vague); cf. People v. Johnson, 147 Cal.
App. 2d 417, 305 P.2d 82 (Dist. Ct. App. 1957)
(&quot;lophophora&quot; not unconstitutionally vague reference to
peyote). </p>

<p>25A related issue was whether the charge of possession of
&quot;marijuana&quot; was specific enough where there were
statutory exceptions to protect the bird seed and hemp
industries. The general rule was that the state need not allege
that the parts possessed were not within the statutory
exceptions. E.g., Simpson v. State, 129 Fla. 1279 176 So. 515
(1937). Contra, People v. Sowrd, 370 111. 140, 18 N.E.2d 176
(1938'). </p>

<p>26See, e.g., Simpson v. State, 129 Fla. 127, 131, 176 So. 515,
517 (1937) (marijuana causes erotic hallucinations, loss of
sense, false conviction, loss of values, a general weakening of
powers, making it dangerous to mind and body). In Commonwealth v.
LaRosa, 42 Pa. D. &amp; C. 34, 36-37 (Fayette County Dist. Ct.
1941), the court stated: </p>

<p>The deleterious, even vicious, qualities of the plant which
render it highly dangerous to the mind and body, upon which it
operates to destroy the will, to produce imaginary delectable
situations, and gradually to weaken the physical powers, reside
in a sticky resin of great narcotic power that pervades the
entire plant .... 27 State v. Bonoa, 172 La. 955, 136 So. 15
(1931). </p>

<p>28 See State v. Hall, 41 Wash. 2d 446, 249 P.2d 769 (1952);
Commonwealth v. LaRosa, 42 Pa. D. &amp; C. 34 (Fayette County
Dist. Ct. 1941). LaRosa held that the statute, passed two years
earlier, created a duty to cut down marijuana plants before they
could seed and that defendant had no right to plant marijuana
even if he meant to cut the plants before maturity. Defendant's
conviction for possession of two thousand mature plants and one
hundred fifty thousand immature plants was accordingly affirmed. </p>

<p>29 See pp. 1074-75 supra. </p>

<p>30 E.g., State v. Economy, 61 Nev. 394, 130 P.2d 264 (1942). </p>

<p>31 This was particularly true in the Southwest, where use
cases were more numerous and appeals more frequent. Indicative of
this trend are the following Texas cases in chronological order:
Gonzales v. State, 108 Tex. Crim. 253, 299 S.W. 901 (1928) ($25
fine); Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 209, 58 S.W.2d 534 (1933)

<p>33 State v. Shotts, 207 La. 898, 22 So. 2d 209, cert. denied,
326 U.S. 730 (1945). </p>

<p>34 See, e.g., United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56 (1950).
The Court here upheld the search of a one-room office on the
grounds that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, and said
that the scope of such searches must turn on the reasonableness
of the search considering all the underlying circumstances. </p>

<p>35 Cf. Anderson v. State, 137 Tex. Crim. 461, 131 S.W.2d 961
(1939). See also Lea) v. State, 169 Tex. Crim. 222, 332 S.W.2d
729 (1959), holding it reasonable for a policeman to search
defendant's shorts where he suspected from an informer's tip that
the &quot;out of the ordinary bulge&quot; in defendant's pants
concealed marijuana. </p>

<p>36 Ramirez v. State, 135 Tex. Crim. 442, 125 SW.2d 597 (1938).
Eventually, courts began to allow the admission of illegally
seized evidence if there was any untainted source whatsoever.
Thus, where defendant testified that the police had found
marijuana in a dresser drawer in his house, the court permitted
the state to introduce the marijuana based on the untainted
source of defendant's own statements in court. Rao v. State, 160
Tex. Crim, 416, 271 S.W_2d 426 (1954). </p>

<p>37 See Connolly v. Medalie, 58 F.2d 629 (2d Cir. 1932). In
that case judge Learned Hand wrote: </p>

<p>Men just wince at admitting that they were the owners, or in
possession, of contraband property; may wish at once to secure
the remedies of a possessor, and avoid the perils of the part;
but equivocation will not serve. If they come as victims, they
must take on that role, with enough detail to cast them without
question. The petitioners at bar shrank from that predicament;
but they were obliged to choose one horn of the dilemma. </p>

<p>Id. at 630 </p>

<p>38 See King v. State, 169 Tex. Crim. 34, 335 SAV.2d 378
(1959). Here the Texas court held, with one dissent, that a
search warrant for the premises of the husband authorized a
search of the wife's bag in the house; her conviction for the
materials found in the bag was affirmed, </p>

<p>In the field of search incident to an arrest, courts went even
farther. Thus, a Texas court affirmed a conviction based upon the
arrest and search of a defendant, even though the police officer
admitted he had arrested the defendant solely for the purpose of
searching him. The officer ostensibly arrested the defendant for
a knife fight, but later admitted that he had arrested him
because he suspected him of possession of marijuana. The court
noted that the defendant was unable to give any authority for his
contention that the state should be bound by the officer's
statement as to the purpose of the arrest. Gonzales v. State, 160
Tex. Crim. 548, 272 S.W.2d 524 (1954). </p>

<p>39 It had been held that contraband may be seized in a search
incident to arrest although the items taken had no relationship
to the crime for which the arrest was made. Harris v. United
States, 331 U.S. 145 (1947). overruled, Chimel v. California, 395
U.S. 752 (1969). </p>

Davis 272 F.2d 149 (7th Cit. 1959). Davis was not strictly an
entrapment case; the government agents had arranged for the
transportation of a hag of marijuana front Texas to Chicago. The
defendant argued that the agents' activities were illegal, and
for that reason, the government was estopped from prosecuting him
and that the evidence was inadmissible. The trial court found
that the defendant had arranged for the deal and instructed the
jury to acquit if the agents had illegally caused the
importation. As in Gilmore, the jury was not willing to condemn
the police, </p>
