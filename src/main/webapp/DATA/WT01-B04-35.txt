<BR> <B> <b>TRADE AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF PRIVACY ON THE NET</b><p>
William C. Altreuter<p>
<BR> </B></B></B></P></FONT> <FONT  COLOR="#"> <TAB> Although little noticed by the trade community, an important trade policy debate has been raging between the Clinton Administration and the computer industry.  Because Government regulators are able to cite "law and order" and "national security" in support of a policy which treats software which incorporates meaningful privacy protection as the equivalent of a Claymore Mine, US software developers -- and the US computer industry as a whole -- are being 
denied an opportunity to compete in what may be the most meaningful segment of the coming Internet economy.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> Before meaningful commerce can occur in cyberspace, there must first be a method of insuring that transactions over the Internet are secure.  Encryption offers the only feasible method for protecting the privacy of such transactions.  US law, 
however, bars the exportation of "strong" encryption software, and in fact treats the exportation of such software in the same manner as munitions.  The reasoning behind this policy is, in essence, that strong encrypted communications would not be accessible to legitimate governmental surveillance, and might therefore be used to plan terrorist activities, or commit criminal acts such as money laundering.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> As a compromise, several proposals have been floated, most recently a plan to allow software makers to export encryption programs with up to 56-bit code keys in exchange for an industry commitment to develop a system which would provide law enforcement officials with the encryption key in appropriate circumstances.  A previous proposed policy, "key escrow", would have placed the encryption key under the control of either a governmental agency, or some designated private agent, which would turn the key over to law enforcement authorities on demand.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> The flaws with either policy should be immediately obvious and go beyond the fact that the Administration's proposal for exportation of 56-bit encryption is technologically outmoded (Netscape Communications, for example, distributed a 128-bit system to US users of the Internet in July but cannot market it overseas).  As is so often the case, this wrong-headed policy is best understood by considering what US reaction would be to such a policy were it to be implemented by another nation.  Obviously, the US would never stand for an international standard for encryption which placed the key to the code in anyone else's hands, and plainly the US's trading partners feel the same way.  As a purely practical matter, there is little difference between the current proposal and its predecessor.  The dilemma here is that this is simply not an area where US law will succeed in jamming US policy down the throats of the rest of the world.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> Because the Internet knows no international borders, powerful encryption programs are already widely available.  By artificially hobbling the ability of US software developers to compete in this area, US policy is effectively cutting off its own manufactures' ability to be competitive in a growth segment of the global economy.  Ironically, this is occurring because the most trade-friendly Administration the US has seen in years has adopted, on this issue, a police-state mentality that would earn outspoken condemnation from the same Administration were it to be enacted by any other government.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> Encryption policy is unlikely to be the sort of issue which will ever excite heated debate in the halls of Congress, since the specter of bomb-carrying terrorists using the Internet to undermine national security is easier to explain than is the importance of confidentiality in business communications.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> As a purely practical matter, however, the effect of this policy is to badly undermine the use of the Internet as a tool for international trade.  For example, current encryption standards seriously compromise the ability of lawyers and clients 
to communicate privately via E-mail, even though the lawyer-client principle is a bedrock concept in American jurisprudence.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> More importantly, the Administration's policy on encryption hamstrings the ability of US software developers to compete internationally by imposing an artificial constraint on a technological problem.  Assuredly, the vacuum that is created by 
this short-sighted thinking will be filled.  It is almost as certain that this vacuum will be filled to the detriment of a segment of the economy where the US has long held dominance.
<BR> 
<BR> <TAB> The Clinton Administration has demonstrated that it is both technologically savvy, and in favor of open trade.  This is clearly not an issue where Congress is likely to be helpful, since it is plainly complex, and susceptible to the sort of negative spin which legislators abhor.  We are not likely to attend any pancake breakfasts where our congressional representatives will boast of making the Internet secure, but it is a safe bet that a vote against strong encryption will be presented as a 
vote which gives terrorists and criminals a new tool to defeat law enforcement efforts.  Just because this is a patently absurd  argument doesn't make it any less likely to be used as a fear-mongering electoral gambit.  Altreuter & Habermehl  invites all interested readers of International Focus to E-mail a copy of this essay, along with your own thoughts to Vice President Gore at <I>agore@whitehouse.gov</I> in the hope that a demonstration of our concerns will compel a re-thinking of a policy which is antithetical to the principles of free trade, economic development, and privacy which are essential to the development of electronic commerce.</FONT>
