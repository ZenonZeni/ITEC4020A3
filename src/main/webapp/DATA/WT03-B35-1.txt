N.J. EXPANDS PSE&G STANDARD OFFER PLAN TO 150 MW FOR 1996-97, AT AVOIDED
COST

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has voted to continue Public
Service Electric & Gas' ``standard offer'' program, and has expanded the
offering for 1996-97 (Docket No. EE95090415).
   Under the plan, PSE&G makes blocks of capacity available for energy
savings and pays its avoided cost to demand-side management projects. The
program began in 1993, when the utility opened a 150-MW block through 1995,
and in its recent order, the BPU expanded that to 185 MW for projects
submitted by Jan. 2, 1996. For its 1996 DSM plan, PSE&G had proposed
opening a new one-year, 75-MW block (DSR, 12 Oct '95, 1), but the BPU
expanded that to 150 MW for 1996-97.
   The new 150-MW offer will be broken into three 50-MW blocks, which will
provide declining payments, since additional capacity will reduce the value
of savings to the company, and thereby, its avoided cost. That figure now
stands at $5.45/kW/month for capacity and about 2.6 cents/kWh for energy.
However, the first 50-MW block of the new standard offer will set prices
27% lower, while the second block will be priced 33% below Standard Offer
No. 1 and the third block will be set 38% below it.
   Although Standard Offer No. 2 is set at 150 MW, the BPU made allowance
for a fourth block with no defined MW size, at prices that would be 44%
lower than Standard Offer No. 1. In addition, there will be a 15-MW
residential ``carve-out,'' with at least half of that reserved for
low-income residences. For those projects, prices will be set 14% higher
than Standard Offer No. 1 for the first half of the contract period, and
33% lower for the second half.
   Further, PSE&G will accept up to 10 MW of fuel-switching projects, but
only at government-owned facilities. It will also accept up to 1 MW of
projects that displace electric air conditioning in summer with chillers
powered by waste heat from cogeneration plants. These must involve existing
cogeneration facilities that exceed 50% efficiency, and they must not
result in incremental fuel use or emissions.
   If New Jersey opens up retail competition, PSE&G will continue to make
standard offer payments to projects whose hosts choose an electric supplier
other than the utility. However, that pledge would only apply if PSE&G is
still allowed to recover its standard offer payments through some type of
system benefits charge. DSM advocates in many states are lobbying for such
charges on distribution services, to maintain efficiency programs in the
face of retail access.
   In the standard offer program, projects are accepted on a first-come,
first-served basis, though they must be qualified by PSE&G for technical
merit and savings potential. They may be installed by users themselves, or
by energy service companies. One ESCO that is active in the program is
PSE&G's own subsidiary, Public Service Conservation Resources Corp.
(PSCRC), which works with customers on standard offer projects and provides
financing.
   In pushing for the continuation of its standard offer program, PSE&G
argued that the market-based approach fits well in the rapidly deregulating
industry. It told the BPU that ``given the right information, price signals
and product and service options, consumers are in the best position to make
decisions about how they should use and conserve energy.''
   It added that the ``decentralized decision-making of a market economy''
would stimulate innovation and reduce costs.
   There is no set budget for the standard offer program, since it will
depend on how much savings PSE&G purchases. However, the BPU approved a
$33-million, two-year budget for the utility to continue some ``core''
programs, such as rebates for lighting and air conditioning retrofits.
   PSE&G's plan was applauded by DSM advocates, including the Mid-Atlantic
Energy Project and N.J. Public Interest Research Group, who also praised
the utility's willingness to work with them. ``PSE&G's DSM plan, and the
process by which it was developed, should serve as a model for other
utilities in New Jersey and around the country,'' stated Daniel Rosenblum,
director of the Mid-Atlantic Energy Project.

CALIF. RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL CALLS ON LAWMAKERS TO ENACT DSM SURCHARGE

   The California Public Utilities Commission called on the California
Legislature to enact a nonbypassable ``public goods'' surcharge on retail
electricity sales to fund energy efficiency and research and development
programs in a competitive electric industry.
   The PUC made the recommendation in its final restructuring order issued
December 20. The commission also recommended that the Legislature adopt a
separate universal surcharge to fund low-income weatherization programs
currently funded through utility demand-side management budgets.
   The commission gave the Legislature, Governor, stakeholders, and the
public 100 days to comment on its decision while the PUC establishes a
``road map'' for implementing restructuring in California. ``Given the
Legislature's role in creating these programs, we do not view it
appropriate to alter them significantly without Legislative guidance,'' the
PUC stated.
   The PUC plans to adopt a funding level, establish an independent
administrator for the DSM and R&D funds, and work out other details during
the implementation phase of restructuring. However, the PUC suggested that
the public goods surcharge should be equal to three percent of total
revenues from electricity sales in California.
   The PUC noted that while support for a nonbypassable surcharge to fund
energy efficiency and conservation programs remained strong, stakeholders
disagreed on the types of programs that should be funded and the
appropriate funding levels.
   The PUC specified that funding for energy efficiency programs should
focus on activities not provided by the competitive market that are in the
broad public interest and designed to transform the energy efficiency
market. The commission conceded that delineating between competitive and
other DSM activities will be difficult.
   ``We do not intend for the surcharge to collect funds to pursue energy
efficiency activities that the competitive market will provide on its
own,'' the PUC said. However, the commission observed that ``many programs
with a market transformation, information, or education focus are not
likely to be provided by the competitive market.''
   While acknowledging that there are various definitions of market
transformation activities, the commission concluded that it was appropriate
to use public funding to ensure that consumers have information about
managing their energy use. Residential and small business customers
generally have a greater need for these public programs than large
customers, which have greater resources available to manage their energy
use, the PUC noted. Moreover, financial incentives to develop the market
for energy efficient products and services, such as the Super-Efficient
Refrigerator Program and manufacturer rebates for fluorescent light-bulbs
and high-efficiency motors should continue, the PUC suggested. ``We expect
that public funding would be needed only for specified and limited periods
of time, to cause the market to be transformed,'' the PUC said.
   The PUC adopted a two-track approach to continuing DSM funding in a
competitive industry. In the short-term the commission plans to utilize the
utilities' expertise in administering DSM programs. However, after a short
transition period, the PUC plans to establish an independent, nonprofit
organization to collect the surcharge and allocate the funds competitively
to ensure equal opportunity for non-utility energy service companies.
   The PUC anticipates that by January 1, 1997 DSM costs will no longer be
embedded in electric rates but will be collected as part of the public
goods surcharge on retail electricity sales. Initially, the surcharge
should be a line item on utility bills corresponding to each utility's
authorized DSM funding in their service area. In time the PUC intends for
the same surcharge to be applied consistently throughout the state.
   The commission plans to hold workshops to provide guidance on
establishing the DSM programs that will be funded through the surcharge,
the details of the independent administrator and transition period, and how
utility expertise can be utilized.
   ``This guidance should be considered a starting point and not final,''
the PUC said. ``If the workshops flesh out the two tracks in more detail
and identify areas where public funding should be expanded or limited, we
will consider modifying our decision.''
   The PUC noted that the California Energy Commission is also
deliberating--through its Energy Services Working Group--how best to
promote energy efficiency in a competitive electric industry. The CEC
working group has recommended a surcharge to fund DSM and energy efficiency
R&D beginning January 1, 1996 while supporting more market-driven funding
approaches. The working group recommended that the PUC continue to oversee
utility DSM expenditures until 1998 while market structure details are
worked out.

MANY STATES REJECT EPACT STANDARDS ON DSM, IRP AND EFFICIENCY IN SUPPLY

   Many states have rejected the efficiency guidelines set down in the 1992
Energy Policy Act (EPACT), saying they conflict with existing state
regulations, according to a recent survey.
   St. Louis consulting firm Brubaker & Associates Inc. (BAI) polled state
commissions and found that almost twice as many states rejected the EPACT
standards as adopted them. However, most commissions took no action,
explaining that they were already in compliance with the standards before
EPACT was passed by Congress in 1992.
   In Section 111 of the act, Congress stated three efficiency standards
(7,8 and 9): integrated resource planning (IRP) should be employed by each
utility, and plans should be updated regularly, providing for public
participation; investments in conservation and demand-side management
should be at least as profitable as supply-side resources, giving
consideration to reduced sales, and should be monitored and evaluated;
energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply should be
encouraged by providing incentives for better maintenance and investments
in efficient generation, transmission and distribution.
   EPACT called for states to consider these guidelines and determine
whether adopting them would be consistent with state law. States were also
told to determine whether adopting the standards would advance conservation
and maintain equitable rates to electricity consumers. The act set a
deadline of Oct. 24, 1995 for these investigations.
   In its survey, Brubaker found that 12 states rejected the IRP standard,
seven adopted it and most others said they were already in compliance (some
had not yet ruled). Similarly, 12 states rejected the criterion for
investments in DSM, while 7 states adopted it and others either said they
were already in compliance or had not yet addressed the issue. On
efficiency in generation, 12 states rejected while only five adopted.
   States that rejected all three standards are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas,
Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia. Those that adopted all three standards
are: Florida, Idaho, Oklahoma and Wyoming. However, several others adopted
the IRP and DSM standards, while rejecting or reaching no decision the last
one, including Colorado, Connecticut and Indiana. Those states that said
they were already in compliance with all standards are: Georgia, Hawaii,
Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina and Vermont.

PS COLORADO OFFERS GAS DRYER REBATES

   Public Service Colorado has inaugurated a natural gas dryer rebate
program that provides $70 to first-time buyers or those replacing an
electric clothes dryer.
   The two-month program expiring Dec. 31, 1995 is part of the company's
demand-side management efforts to help customers use energy wisely.
   ``Customers can dry almost three loads of laundry in a natural gas dryer
for what it costs to dry one load in an electric dryer,'' said Kathy
Worthington, marketing program leader at PS Colorado. The offer is
available only to residential customers of the company.

PEPCO PROVIDES $250,000 TO NON-PROFITS

   Potomac Electric Power spent $250,000 in 1995 to help subsidize the
weatherization of homes belonging to low-income and senior customers. Over
the past 12 years, the utility has helped weatherize more than 20,000
homes, working in conjunction with charitable groups.
   Under its Community Conservation Program, the company awarded contracts
worth $250,000 in 1995 to non-profit, community-based organizations to do
the work. Matching funds from private organizations brought the total
budget up to about $1-million for the year.

N.Y. ALJ BACKS SYSTEM BENEFITS CHARGE TO FUND DSM AS COMPETITION OPENS UP

   An administrative law judge at the New York Public Service Commission
has recommended imposing a mechanism to fund demand-side management as the
state opens up competition. She also emphasized wholesale, rather than the
retail competition that DSM advocates fear would encourage cheap, dirty
power.
   ALJ Judith Lee issued her proposed decision in the PSC's Competitive
Opportunities case (No. 94-E-0952). In it, she stated that ``Retail
competition has the potential to benefit all customers by providing greater
choice among their electricity providers, as well as increased pricing and
reliability options. But retail access brings with it significant risks and
requires considerable caution, and should be provided only if it is in the
best interests of all consumers.''
   With that note of caution, she urged the PSC to establish wholesale
competition first, ``with an eye toward adding retail access as rapidly as
possible once a market is established and reliability is ensured.''
However, she offered no time frame for the transition, and retail wheeling
advocates--such as large industrials--bitterly condemned the decision,
saying it gives utilities veto power over moves toward retail access.
   In earlier comments in the case, DSM advocates joined the utilities in
endorsing a wholesale pool, rather than retail access (DSR, 9 Nov '95, 7).
They argued that deregulation ``must protect the long-term economic and
environmental health of the state, and not focus entirely on short-term
price considerations.'' With a wholesale pool, they said, regulators would
have more control over resource choices, and could insist that distribution
utilities acquire a certain amount of DSM and renewables. They could also
impose a ``system benefits charge'' on retail rates to fund DSM and
renewables.
   But even if retail competition were allowed, distribution utilities
would still deliver power from outside producers, and regulators could
impose the system benefits charge or ``wires charge'' on those deliveries,
the efficiency groups said. In her proposed decision, Judge Lee opened the
door for the option: ``Any restructuring model should include a mechanism
for recovering costs required to be spent on environmental and other public
policy considerations.''
   The ALJ ruling was praised by David Wooley, executive director of Pace
Energy Project, at the Pace University Center for Environmental Legal
Studies in White Plains, N.Y. He said Judge Lee was ``appropriately
cautionary'' about the transition to retail competition. Further, ``She has
clearly endorsed a system benefits charge, and that was one of our main
objectives,'' he told Demand-Side Report.
   Wooley foresees a system benefits charge of 1.5-2 mills/kWh, which he
said would have a minimal rate impact. The funds could be administered by a
non-profit entity, a ``quasi-governmental'' entity whose board would
contain representatives of all customer sectors. Wooley does not rule out
utilities overseeing DSM efforts, but he fears any link between the
distribution company and its generation affiliate, which might oppose DSM.
``It's not impossible to erect barriers, but we're concerned because the
generating company would see DSM as competition, just it would see other
generators as competition,'' he said.
   Wooley is skeptical of the argument--often advance by retail competition
advocates--that in an open market, energy service companies would
proliferate to replace utility DSM programs. ``It's not at all clear that
ESCOs would arise to take over the conservation efforts,'' he said.
``Especially during a transition period, you need mechanisms to jump-start
the market.''
   Eventually, the system benefits charge could shrink, Wooley said, but he
added, ``There will always be a place for this to bring new technologies to
the market.'' He said the 1.5-2 mills/kWh surcharge is a ``reasonable''
proposal that could benefit everyone if it is administered well.
   On that note, Wooley dismissed the notion put forth by large users that
they are non-participants in most of the programs. ``Anyone who buys
commercial lighting has benefited from DSM efforts,'' he said. ``The market
has advanced, and what is standard now is very different from what was
standard a few years ago.'' To continue that market transformation, DSM
funds could go to equipment manufacturers, as well as users, to subsidize
efficiency upgrades in their product lines, he said.

UTILITIES MUST SHIFT INDUSTRIAL DSM TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, REPORT ADVISES

   Although utilities are under pressure to cut costs in the competitive
market, they must view industrial demand-side management as a means of
retaining these customers in that same tough environment, according to a
recent report.
   However, DSM must be shifted from a ``resource procurement'' strategy to
a customer-service approach, says IRT Environment Inc.. The Basalt, Colo.,
information and consulting firm surveyed manufacturers and utilities and
found that they are far apart on what industrial DSM should include.
   The problem is urgent, IRT says, because industrials are utilities'
``least captive'' customers, with options for fuel switching, cogeneration,
and shifting loads to other regions. Most of them are unhappy paying for
DSM in the first place, and say they do not even get much for these rate
hikes. Many large manufacturers have been pursuing energy conservation for
years, IRT notes, and they condemn rate-based DSM as a subsidy for
others--including competing industrial firms that have not taken the same
initiative. ``Utilities have been regarded by many industrial customers as
vestiges of a socialist system, monopolies used to deliver not only
electricity but public policy,'' IRT says.
   Part of the problem is that utility DSM programs are often rigid,
providing audits and rebates for motors and lighting, but not improving
processes, the report notes. This type of work is much more difficult
because processes can differ greatly from industry to industry, and even
from company to company within an industry. Process improvements demand the
kind of customized services that utilities must provide in the more
competitive market, according to the report. These should transcend energy
efficiency, and also focus on productivity improvements and pollution
control, IRT advises. However, utilities are still likely to encounter
hostility. In interviewing industrials, IRT found that some doubt utilities
are capable of providing effective energy services, since they have no
entrepreneurial skills. They think utilities should just get out of the way
and stop hiking rates for programs that are unwanted. At best, utilities
can promote efficiency through information, cost-based rates and financing,
some firms said.
   To overcome industrial skepticism, some utilities are contracting with
existing energy service companies or even acquiring existing ESCOs. They
may offer energy services outside of rate base through unregulated
subsidiaries. Others are using consultants with expertise in particular
industries to help their customers.
   Another approach is taken by Niagara Mohawk Power in New York, which
allows industrials to opt out of DSM rebate programs and avoid the rate
impact. However, the utility will link these customers with private ESCOs,
and will help them line up financing for efficiency projects. Meanwhile,
Detroit Edison has made efficiency part of the long-term supply contracts
it has signed with the ``Big 3'' automakers. The utility will provide 38
on-site energy managers, and has already seen $1-million in savings at
several facilities in a limited test of the program.
   The report, ``Industrial Efficiency Programs: Building Strategic
Partnerships,'' is available for $100 from The Results Center, IRT
Environment Inc., P.O. Box 2239, Basalt, Colo. 81621; (970) 927-3155.

NRDC PUSHING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PLAN IN LONG ISLAND LIGHTING RESTRUCTURING

   The Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups are lobbying the
Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to emphasize energy efficiency in its
restructuring of Long Island Lighting.
   Concerned by the utility's high rates--averaging 15.3 cents/kWh--and
their impact on the economy, New York Gov. George Pataki has called for the
dismantling of the utility. He recently proposed a plan that calls for LIPA
to take over LILCO's distribution system, auction off its generating
plants, and shop around for the cheapest power in the wholesale market.
   However, NRDC, the Long Island Citizens Advisory Panel (CAP) and other
DSM proponents stress that the governor's plan only predicts 12% rate
reductions, which will not nearly bring rates in line with regional or
national averages. The only way to help businesses and residences is to cut
their bills by aggressively pursuing DSM, they argue (DSR, 7 Dec, 3).
   Presenting the breakup plan, neither Gov. Pataki nor LIPA chairman James
Gill mentioned energy efficiency. However, Ashok Gupta, senior energy
economist for New York-based NRDC, told Demand-Side Report that he has
gotten a good reception at LIPA and has further meetings planned for early
in the new year.
   In an outline of its Long Island Energy Efficiency Initiative, NRDC
notes that the State Energy Plan estimates the savings potential on Long
Island at $400-million per year, but ``without technical and financial
assistance, these economic investments appear difficult, risky and
expensive,'' it warns. Some subsidies are needed because ``High transaction
costs, scarcity and cost of capital, lack of expertise, split incentives
and other related hurdles stand in the way of private-sector investment in
energy efficiency.''
   To overcome those hurdles, NRDC has proposed a fund that would financed
through through a 0.2 cents/kWh rate surcharge. That would raise
$32-million per year over five years, or $160-million, which could be
administered by LIPA and the New York Power Authority (NYPA). However, all
energy services and products would be delivered by private energy service
companies.
   Incentives would serve as a marketing tool for ESCOs, and these would be
made available on a first-come, first-served basis, so that ``energy
service companies will in essence race to enroll new projects, generating a
quick market upsurge,'' NRDC predicts. LIPA, or whatever entity takes over
LILCO's distribution system, would let ESCOs collect payments from
consumers through their monthly electric bills.
   Part of the efficiency fund could be used to guarantee loans by private
lenders, to make capital more accessible and hold down interest rates,
according to the plan. The financial institutions could collect these loans
through electric bills, and payments could be timed so that users pay them
off through energy savings.
   In addition, LIPA could provide ``energy savings advances.'' Under this
scheme, when consumers sign contracts with ESCOs, they would be given
interest-free advances of 10% of their total investment, to be repaid
through future bills.
   The initiative would also provide coupons to cut the cost of purchases,
such as efficient lighting, refrigerators and other appliances. ``Though
purchases of such equipment often pay for themselves out of saved energy
costs, their higher up-front cost often deters consumers,'' NRDC notes.
Some coupons could be given to landlords, to encourage efficient purchases,
since renters usually have no say in their appliances, even though they pay
the bills. Other funds could be used to support design assistance for
architects and builders, and to accelerate the introduction of new
technologies.
   Overall, NRDC sees the initiative providing an additional 10% reduction
in energy bills, as well as stimulating private-sector investment worth
$1-billion, helping businesses become more competitive and creating jobs in
energy services and construction.

CONSULTANTS SEE NEED FOR UTILITIES TO RETHINK TRADITIONAL BUSINESS

   ``Electric utilities are dead,'' according to Mitch Diamond, vice
president, energy group, at Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., the New York
City-based consulting firm.
   In their stead are a number of distinct businesses that traditional
investor-owned utilities can choose to participate in or not as the
industry restructures, Diamond said. Whereas utilities now vertically
integrate generation, transmission, distribution and customer service,
these and other business functions will evolve into separate business
enterprises, in the form of power production companies, regional network
operators, bulk power traders, distribution system operators and retail
power marketers.
   Diamond made his remarks at the ``Competitive Analysis and Benchmarking
for Power Companies'' conference last month, sponsored by the Boston-based
Center for Business Intelligence in Washington D.C. The conference brought
together a number of consultants and utility executives to talk about the
integration of competitive intelligence techniques into the utility
industry as restructuring and deregulation progresses.
   Diamond said utilities should concentrate on organizing themselves to do
better in the future what they have already done in the past. To accomplish
this, a lot of analysis and hard thinking will be required, he said. He
suggested that executives decide which parts of the business they are best
at and concentrate on them, leaving the parts that they are weakest at to
other companies.
   He cautioned against a strategy pursued by several major utilities in
the industry: going overseas to build power plants in developing countries.
``Your business is not to go build plants in Argentina,'' he said, ``but to
be better in the business you're now in, here in the states.''
   To back up his claim, he presented data suggesting that the best
performers in different industries consistently outperform by wide margins
the average performance within those industries. In effect, he said,
pursuing international development opportunities may provide short-term
windfalls, but to the possible detriment of the work necessary to excel at
home.
   And to excel in the native market, he said, utilities must become more
customer-sensitive and willing to tailor their services to individual
customers' needs. In his company's analysis, he said it was discovered
that, across a variety of industries, customers switch providers as much,
if not more so, because of poor service as because of price differences. He
said the way to ensure the least amount of customer flight is to treat
customers as individuals, learn their individual needs and respond to them.
That way, when a new supplier woos them, the bond of loyalty and
recognition will be harder to break.
   Also speaking at the conference was Sanford Cohen, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch, who presented a regional analysis of how 50 utilities stand in terms
of their industrial power prices.
   In the mid-Atlantic region, Merrill Lynch found that Allegheny Power,
with ``among the lowest price and cost structures in the nation,'' was
strongest, with Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pennsylvania Power and & Light,
DQE and PECO Energy also strong. The analyst forecast that PECO Energy,
Public Service Enterprise Group and DQE would soon bring their current high
prices ``in-line with regional averages.'' Most at risk because of
competition in the region were General Public Utilities and Public Service
Electric & Gas.
   The Midwest, Merrill Lynch said, is ``another area that is primed for
competition.'' It noted Ohio Edison, Detroit Edison and DQE as expected
good performers. Most at risk is CMS Energy.
   In the Northeast, the analyst firm found no utilities in good
competitive positions. ``By national standards,'' it said, ``all of the
utilities in the Northeast have high prices. These price levels are not
going unnoticed by customers in the region. More than any other region, the
problems of the Northeast are homogeneous and it is in each utility's
interest to stall retail wheeling as long as possible.'' It picked
Northeast Utilities as the utility with the greatest chance to improve its
position.
   In the Southeast, Merrill Lynch picked Carolina Power & Light as most
likely to improve, although it is currently ``the weakest of regional
competitors. Improvements in nuclear performance coupled with large
reductions in O&M budgets over the next several years should help improve
the company's cost structure. Prices will also decline dramatically due to
the expiration of riders for nuclear investment recovery, as well as
expected discounting for industrial customers.'' It picked Southern Company
and Duke Power as presently best equipped to handle competition.
   In the region including Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the analyst found
that Entergy is showing the greatest improvement. It said its analysis in
this region was otherwise incomplete.
   And in the West, the analyst found that California utilities are highly
at risk because of power-purchase contracts and commitments to costly
nuclear facilities, a situation not likely to improve, despite ``heroic
efforts...to reduce price levels,'' because of the huge interconnected grid
in the West availing customers of cheaper supplies from Canada and Mexico
and elsewhere in the region.

COINCIDENT PEAK RATES HELP N.C. MUNI LOWER ITS WHOLESALE POWER COSTS

   The municipal utility in Greenville, N.C., said that
coincident-peak-based rates it charges all large industrial, commercial and
institutional customers has helped the muni realize significant savings in
its wholesale power costs, which are based in large part on Greenville's
peak demand each month.
   The Greenville Utilities Commission, as the muni is known, also said it
hopes to trim peak-period demand even more with a residential time-of-use
rate available beginning this month to 200 partipants in a pilot test.
   Roger Jones, general manager of the Greenville muni, said all muni
customers that demand 750 kW or more now pay one of three coincident peak
(CP) rates: An ``A'' rate for those whose energy use must be relatively
constant; a ``B'' rate for those with more flexibility; and a ``C'' rate
for those willing and able to make significant reductions in their energy
use during coincident peaks.
   Under each rate, the customer pays a basic monthly charge of $440, plus
a relatively high per/kW rate for its demand during the 60 minutes each
month when the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA)--the
muni's wholesale supplier--experiences its highest systemwide demand.
   The customer also pays a much smaller per/kW charge for difference
between that coincident-peak level and its highest demand for all that
month, plus energy charges.
   For instance, under the ``C'' rate, a 3-MW customer that reduces its
coincident-peak demand to 1 MW pays a $440 basic charge, plus demand
charges of $21.34/kW on the 1-MW coincident-peak demand and $2.86/kW on the
2 MW above that level. The customer also pays an energy charge of 3.323
cents/kWh.
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW and higher customers together account
for about one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use, and that the CP
rates have encouraged them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20%
from what it typically would have been without the CP rates.
   He noted that reduction translates directly into savings in the
wholesale power costs paid by Greenville to NCEMPA, which buys most of its
power from Carolina Power & Light.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varied widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%.
   One large industrial customer that typically demands about 8 MW reduces
its demand to between 1 and 1.5 MW during coincident peaks, Jones noted,
saving both the customer and the muni thousands of dollars in monthly power
costs.
   The residential time-of-use rate program Greenville is now pilot-testing
also is aimed at reducing peak-period demand and wholesale power costs.
   Jones said the pilot requires that participants sign up for the muni's
``Beat-the-Peak'' load-management program, under which load-control
switches are placed on customers' heat pumps, electric furnaces, central
air conditioners and electric water heaters, and those devices are remotely
switched off during peak periods.
   The TOU program sets on-peak and off-peak energy-use hours for three
different times of the year. On-peak hours are 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. during the
months of January, February, March, November and December; 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.
in May, June, July, August and September; and 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
to 7 p.m. in April and October.
   Participants pay a basic customer charge of $13.09/month, plus 6.449
cents/kWh for off-peak energy and 17.402 cents/kWh for on-peak energy. The
standard residential rate, in comparison, features a basic customer charge
of $8.09/month, plus energy charges of 9.473 cents for all kWh used from
July through October, and 8.257 cents for all kWh used the rest of the
year.
   Jones said he expects the residential TOU pilot to make at least a
slight contribution to lowering Greenville's peak-period demand, and
anticipates that after a year-long test and perhaps some adjustments, a
residential TOU rate is likely to be offered on a much wider scale in
1997.
   He added, however, that unlike the CP rate for large energy users, the
muni ``for the foreseeable future'' is likely to give residential customers
a choice between standard and a TOU rates.

SDG&E RETROFITS LIGHTS AT 175 SCHOOLS; SAVINGS ESTIMATED AT
$1.8-MILLION/YEAR

   San Diego Gas & Electric has completed an $11-million lighting retrofit
project at 175 schools in the San Diego Unified School District and
officials expect an annual savings of $1.8-million in energy bills.
   The utility said the project, largest of its type on the SDG&E system,
is expected to conserve 16.2 million kWh each year. Under SDG&E's
demand-side management incentive program, shareholders will receive about
$2-million more in earnings, the company said.
   The installations in each school included energy-efficient fluorescent
lamps, ballasts and fixtures in offices and classrooms. Also, occupancy
sensors in classrooms ensure lights are automatically turned off when not
in use. Exit signs also are saving energy with light-emitting diode kits.
   Gregg Lawless, SDG&E marketing account executive who served as team
leader for the lighting retrofit, said employees working on the project
used faster and better approaches.
   ``We broke some rules,'' Lawless said. ``The project's one-year time
line may seem long at first, but not when you recall that there are 175
schools. That's two days per school for the retrofits of all classrooms and
offices--to get done without disrupting classes.'' Lawless said, ``We
moved fast, took risks and emphasized a high level of teamwork, both
internally and with our contractors and the school district.''
   As an example, he said, SDG&E's procurement agents ``moved us through
the selection of contractors and bidding very quickly. It can be a
cumbersome process, but they did it in less than 60 days.'' Another key
factor in the project success, Lawless said, was excellent communication,
especially by SDG&E's team of energy consultants led by Kraig Akers.
   Lawless said, ``Akers and his team completed the audits for all 175
schools, they calculated the estimated energy savings and they determined
our incentives for the customer.'' On this project, he said, each energy
audit involved a representative of SDG&E, the school district and the
school district's energy consultant.
   ``The complexity of this approach,'' Lawless said, ``increased the need
for good communication. Throughout the project, we've made a point to keep
everyone up to date at all times, on all matters. It helps us to stay
focused.''
   Mike Lorch, principal of Kearny High School, said, ``There's a dramatic
change in the quality of light in classrooms and it's had a very positive
impact on morale at our school. Some teachers were so fired up, they went
out and bought supplies and painted classrooms on their own time.''

LOAD RESEARCH PROJECT SEEN MAXIMIZING DSM EFFORT FOR N.C. MUNICIPAL AGENCY

   North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1, which arranges power for 19
municipal utilities in western North Carolina, said a far-reaching
load-research project it is undertaking should help the agency maximize the
effectiveness of its extensive demand-side management effort.
   Mark Otersen, NCMPA-1's supervisor of demand-side operations, said the
$250,000 project will involve the installation by this spring of new,
modified metering equipment at the agency's largest wholesale power
delivery points, as well as equipment to monitor the loads of ``well over
50'' of its munis' largest retail customers.
   The delivery-point meters--combined with telecommunications and computer
equipment to transmit and compile the meter data--will enable NCMPA-1 to
measure the demand of its muni members on a real-time, minute-by-minute
basis, he said. The customer-load monitors, in turn, will let the agency
gather information on customer demand and chart customer load
``shapes''--or patterns of demand.
   That data, Otersen said, should help NCMPA-1 design a menu of
innovative, DSM-related rates for industries with common load shapes, and
help its member munis convince large energy users of the benefits of using
such rates.
   He noted that relatively few of the large retail customers served by
munis in western North Carolina currently participate in load-management
programs that provide incentives to those who agree to let their utility
curtail or interrupt power during peak periods, or who agree to run
peak-shaving standby generators.
   With the customer-load data and newly developed rates in hand, Otersen
said, NCMPA-1 and its members ``will be able to say to a large customer,
`Here is where you are now, and here is how much you might save if you
could shift this much demand.' ''
   Also the new delivery-point meters and customer monitors could be used
to give NCMPA-1 precise data on the impact individual elements of its
overall DSM effort have on demand. For instance, he said, a muni might
implement only its load control program for standby generation, or for
residential water heaters, and be able to measure the MW difference between
demand just before controls were implemented and just after.
   In the future, with that information in hand, Otersen added, it might be
possible for NCMPA-1 and its munis to determine on some days that they only
need to implement a portion of their overall DSM effort--perhaps only
residential air-conditioner load controls--to meet their load-reduction
goals.
   Otersen and Woody Adams, the agency's power-supply manager, noted that
optimizing NCMPA-1's DSM effort really is only a side benefit of the
$250,000 load-research project, which is being undertaken primarily to
enable the agency know with considerable accuracy how much surplus energy
it has available each hour for possible sale to others on the wholesale
market.
   That knowledge will become increasingly important through the late
1990s, when the agency expects to have increasing amounts of surplus energy
available as Duke Power buys back less and less of NCMPA-1's 850-MW
entitlement to Duke's 2,200-MW Catawba nuclear power station in Clover,
S.C.

PORTLAND GENERAL TO LIMIT LIGHTING REBATES; SETS `SITE-BASED' INCENTIVES

   Portland General Electric has proposed an ``Earth Smart'' program to
provide incentives for energy-efficient commercial design; the utility will
limit its lighting rebates; and it plans to initiate ``site-based''
incentives that provide different incentives based on the sized of a
customer's facility.
   The changes to its non-residential program are not as dramatic as
expected, given that PGE has said its demand-side management target would
drop significantly in 1996, according to Lynn Plamondon, an Oregon Public
Utility Commission staff member. The company said earlier it would
make the transition from a target of 20 MW to a ``threshold goal'' of 6 MW,
which means the threshold is only a bare minimum (DSR, 28 Sept '95, 8).
   Plamondon noted that PGE's least-cost plan, which includes the proposal
to lower DSM goals, has not yet been ``acknowledged'' by the Oregon PUC.
   ``The company's goals will be controversial. Their target is up to 6 MW.
I am not sure we will go for that. I have seen the higher targets push them
to do more. If they have target of 5 or 6 MW, I am not sure they will be
pushed to do that.''
   In it proposed changes to its nonresidential programs, PGE wants to
begin the Earth Smart commercial program. ``The goal of the program is to
encourage construction of commercial buildings with the highest level of
cost-effective energy efficiency and environmental sensitivity,'' says a
commission memo.
   Earth Smart is expected to save 1.2 average megawatts annually at a
total resource cost of 2.2 cents/kWh and a utility program cost of 1.4
cents/kWh. The cost-effectiveness limit is 3.1 cents/kWh, according to the
memo.
   It will be offered at two levels: one, the ``gold'' option applies to
buildings that produce energy savings at least 30% above the Oregon Energy
Code. The ``green'' option applies to buildings yielding savings at least
20% above the code.
   Customized financial incentives for architectural design assistance, an
integrated package of energy efficient building and equipment measures and
building commissioning will be included, according to the staff memo.
Customer incentives plus other program costs are limited to either 50% of
the project's incremental costs or 2 cents/kWh, whichever is lower.
   In addition, PGE wants to revise its lighting program rebates to reflect
changes in equipment costs, practices, equipment availability and new
energy efficiency lighting measures. Lighting rebates will only go to
commercial buildings and industrial facilities of less than 20,000 square
feet. Customized incentives for lighting and other energy efficiency
measures will be available to owners of facilities larger than 20,000
square feet based on the economics of the project, according to the staff
memo.
   PGE also wants to implement different incentives based on the size of
the facility. ``The purpose of the program is to allow PGE more flexibility
in delivering energy efficiency to different target markets,'' said the
staff memo.
   Owners of buildings that are 20,000 square feet or smaller will continue
to receive incentives of up to 25% of the incremental cost for measures not
available under other demand-side management options.
   But PGE proposes to increase the minimum simple payback period from 1 to
1.5 years for measures that qualify for incentives.
   Incentives for facilities larger than 20,000 square feet will be
customized based on the economics of the project, but will not exceed 2
cents/kWh saved. ``The focus of this incentive option is on the energy
efficiency of the overall facility for proposed new construction or
retrofit projects,'' said the staff memo.
   The site-based incentives program is expected to save up to 1.4 average
MW annually. The total resource cost will be 2.9 cents/kWh and the utility
program cost will be 1.1 cents/kWh.
   The proposals are expected to be approved by the commission and go into
effect Jan. 1, 1996.

PACIFICORP OFFERS FREE EFFICIENCY MEASURES FOR ORE. APARTMENT OWNERS

   PacifiCorp has offered to provide $2.5-million in free energy-saving
measures to 10,000 apartment owners in Oregon as part of the Environmental
Technology Leadership Challenge, a national program that will be launched
in Portland, Ore., where the utility is based.
   Under the program, businesses, government organizations and non-profit
groups issue challenges designed to improve environmental quality.
   The project is sponsored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Foundation and
funded by a number of businesses, said Curt Nichols, senior energy program
manager for the Portland Energy Office.
   The first 10,000 apartment owners who sign up will receive the free
energy-saving measures, said a spokeswoman for PacifiCorp.
   That is expected to save 2.5 MW in 1996. It is a follow-up of an earlier
program that provided free energy-saving measures to owners of multi-family
units, she said.
   In addition, PacifiCorp is working with the Portland Trail Blazers
basketball team to challenge facility managers to install state-of-the-art
energy technologies, said Nichols.
   And Philips Lighting in Portland asked public and private companies
using florescent lamps to switch to ``Econowatt'' florescent tubes that use
mercury technology.
   The lamp is said to be the first mercury florescent lamp with low
enough mercury levels to allow for non-toxic disposal.
   Similar programs will be launched in Chicago, Orlando, Fla., Chula
Vista, Calif. and Baltimore in a few weeks.

SESCO PETITIONS REGULATORS ON PG&E'S PLAN FOR OVER-COLLECTED DSM FUNDS

   SESCO Inc., the Lake Forest, N.J.-based energy service company, has
filed a protest with the California Public Utilities Commission over
Pacific Gas & Electric's proposal for distributing $23.4-million plus
interest of over-collected demand-side management funds from 1993 and
1994.
   PG&E has filed an ``advice letter'' (Document 1555-E) with the CPUC,
noting that it underspent its 1993 and 1994 electric DSM budgets by a total
of $106.9-million. The commission has already required that $83.5-million
be returned to ratepayers (Decision 94-12-047). The number was an estimate
and the CPUC directed the utility to notify it of any significant changes
in its 1994 year end balances. PG&E said it has closed out its accounts for
those years and has an additional $23.4-million in over-collected funds,
for a total of $106.9-million.
   The utility now proposes to retain the final $23.4-million and reserve
it for eventual payment to contractors participating in its ``integrated''
bidding solicitation. The pilot integrated resource bid effort is being
conducted by PG&E at the request of the CPUC to test how well supply-side
and demand-side resources can compete for the same block of capacity (DSR
13 April '95, 2; 19 Jan, 3).
   The utility maintains that if the integrated bidding contract payments
exceed the amount retained, any future unspent DSM funds would be reserved
to cover the spending. PG&E is currently engaged in contract negotiations
with 13 winning DSM bidders, representing 37 MW, at a cost of
$28.9-million, to be paid over the seven to 10 years of any completed
contracts.
   In its advice letter, PG&E said it had unsuccessfully asked the CPUC to
suspend integrated bidding because it was ``very concerned'' about entering
into long term, pay-for-performance DSM contracts at a time when the
California electric utility industry is restructuring. The utility said
that any agreement to pay for energy savings over a multi-year period could
result in an increase in stranded costs for PG&E.
   SESCO says that, while it supports the need to develop a way to deal
with the issue of long term DSM commitments under restructuring, ``we
definitely believe this advice letter is not the appropriate vehicle.'' It
notes that the utility should ``leave restructuring issues to the
restructuring docket,'' which the CPUC is considering.
   SESCO also believes that PG&E's proposal does increase rates. It also
says if a transfer of funds proceeds, the utility should provide for a
residential set aside.
   The unspent funds should be allotted at the same ratio as originally
intended, says SESCO. Residential customers provide about 35% of PG&E's
revenues, so should receive a similar portion of the unspent budget amounts
credited, says the firm. SESCO contends that the advice letter and
procedure will ``result in continuing damage to the interests of
residential customers.''
   SESCO says the 1993 and 1994 programs and budgets were approved by the
CPUC to meet needs of all ratepayers. It notes, ``instead of the transfer
of funding to an untested and unreviewed set of programs that largely
exclude residential customers, we propose that funding go to support
existing programs that have received full regulatory review and do not
discriminate against PG&E's residential customers.''

NIPSCO NEGOTIATING WITH UNNAMED PARTNER TO DEVELOP RESIDENTIAL ENERGY
SERVICES

   Northern Indiana Public Service is negotiating with an unidentified
company to develop and provide a variety of energy efficiency programs for
residential customers within its service territory.
   ``We want to give people the tools to help them manage their energy,''
said a NIPSCO spokeswoman. The Hammond-based utility has been criticized by
some consumer advocates for its less-than-enthusiastic support for
demand-side management.
   ``There's a reason for that,'' the spokeswoman told Demand-Side Report. 
``Traditional demand-side management programs, as we see them, have not
been effective.'' Consequently, if the current negotiations produce a
partnering agreement, ``we're calling it energy efficiency, not demand-side
management.''
   Whatever it is called, NIPSCO is looking to launch a pilot program in
its service territory later this year that would help residential customers
learn more about their energy usage in exchange for information about that
usage. The program would involve ``taking data you would get off a meter
and helping residential customers identify what their energy usage is,''
the spokeswoman said.
   The utility hopes to develop a ``pre-paid metering'' service it can
market to customers as well as a host of other programs, including
residential energy management. The spokeswoman declined to identify its
prospective partner except to say the company is not another utility or
utility vendor. ``We're talking about partnering with hardware and software
companies,'' she said.
   NIPSCO recently signed a five-year agreement to provide meter-reading
services to the city of Elkhart, Ind., following the completion of a
successful pilot program. Though not a DSM program, the program is an
example of how much emphasis NIPSCO is placing on meter reading, something
the utility believes it does very well.
   NIPSCO also is negotiating with other investor-owned electric utilities,
rural electric membership corporations, municipal electric systems and
water utilities to provide them with meter reading services also.

1994 SHAREHOLDER INCENTIVES APPROVED FOR SOCAL ED, PG&E, SDG&E AND SOCAL
GAS

   The California Public Utilities Commission December 20 approved
shareholder incentives for 1994 demand-side management programs of Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and
Southern California Gas. The 1995 annual earnings assessment proceeding
constitutes the first application of the PUC's new ex post protocols to
utility DSM earnings claims. Beginning with this proceeding, the PUC
implemented a more stringent framework for evaluating savings from utility
DSM prgrams, linking new comprehensive measurements to utility earnings
from DSM shareholder incentives.
   In accordance with the new rules, utility total earnings' claims will be
based on the prior program year's achievements, with per-unit savings
measured over a 7 to 10 year period after implementation of the programs.
Utilities may recover those claims in four equal installments in rates in
the first, second, fifth, and tenth years of the proceeding.
   The PUC authorized Edison to recover $7.2-million of total shareholder
earnings from its 1994 DSM programs in four equal installments over a
10-year measurement period, with recovery of 25% or $1.8-million in 1996.
Edison estimated that its 1994 DSM programs would yield $129-million of net
benefits before earnings for $99.2 million of related program
expenditures.
   Similarly, the PUC awarded PG&E $19,317,000 for its 1994 DSM shareholder
incentive earnings to be recovered in four installments over a 10-year
measurement period. The PUC authorized PG&E to recover $4,344,038 in 1996
for its electric programs and $485,213 for its gas programs. PG&E
forecasted $202.6-million of net benefits before earnings for
$158.2-million worth of DSM program expenditures in 1994.
   The PUC awarded SDG&E $8,966,100 for its 1994 DSM shareholder incentive
earnings. As with the other utilities, the PUC authorized San Diego to
recover the total amount in four installments over a 10-year measurement
period, with recovery in 1996 of $2,189,930 for its electric programs and
$183,228 for its gas programs. SDG&E forecast $64-million in net benefits
before earnings for $30.2 million of DSM program expenditures in 1994. The
PUC likewise authorized SoCalGas to recover $2,898,000 for its 1994 DSM
shareholder incentive earnings in four installments over a 10-year
measurement period, with recovery of $714,582 in 1996. SoCal Gas projected
that its 1994 DSM programs would yield $14.8-million of net benefits for
$42.8-million of program expenditures. The PUC also approved SoCal Gas'
request to recover $7,254,000 in 1996 revenue requirements due to changes
in federal and state corporate income tax liabilities as a result of 1993
federal tax reform legislation.
   The PUC directed the utilities when feasible to consider non-price
factors along with price factors in their resource procurement. To the
extent that non-price factors developed for supply-side resources in state
resource plans affect DSM programs utilities should include them in
cost-effective analyses. Non-price factors should be included in the Rate
Impact Measure test. The PUC also directed electric utilities to publish
information on transmission and distribution costs for the purpose of
quantifying avoided costs.
   Moreover, the utilities will be required to confer with the PUC's
Division of Ratepayer Advocates and other interested stakeholders to
determine the appropriate avoided costs in their annual forecasts.
   The PUC directed the utilities to utilize the avoided cost calculation
in their annual forecasts to determine benefits and related earnings for
each DSM program.
   In other action, as part of PG&E's general rate case the PUC authorized
PG&E to spend $129.42-million for DSM programs in 1996, including
$99-million for energy efficiency programs, one-third less than the
$150-million PG&E spent on conservation programs in 1994. PG&E spent an
average $155 million-a-year for conservation programs between 1990 and
1994, and an average $123-million-a-year between 1980 and 1994. The PUC
ordered PG&E to spend $5-million for programs designed to transform the
market for energy efficient residential appliances, industrial motors, and
commercial air conditioning. PG&E had opposed spending money on market
transformation programs, arguing that the benefits were difficult to
measure and noting that the PUC has not yet developed appropriate policy or
measurement protocols.
   The PUC denied the utility's plan to spend $6.5-million in expenses plus
$12-million in capital costs to install 40,000 time-of-use meters to enable
customers to take advantage of off-peak rates. The PUC determined that the
meters would likely be rendered obsolete by technological advances
following electric restructuring because they lacked the ability to provide
real-time information and cannot be read remotely.
