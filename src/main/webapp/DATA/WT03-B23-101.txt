    Didn't Know How:      14% 
    Threats:               3% </pre>
<B>In sum, most people do not report the mistreatment and of the cases where the mistreatment is reported, almost half choose to report the incident to a lawyer rather than to the police or Deputy Ombudsman. People do not report to the latter categories mainly due to fear and or because they are resigned to the belief that nothing will be achieved by formally complaining.</B>
