         <P><FONT SIZE=4>There's more to successful solid-waste
         disposal than "picking up the garbage." It has to be done in
         a manner that satisfies not only the individual customer,
         but also the community and the environment.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         At Albany-Lebanon Sanitation, our service includes regular
         garbage pick-up, recycling, and several types of specialized
         containers and services. We strive to employ the latest
         equipment and handling methods for safe, and efficient
         removal of solid waste.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         In the "perfect" waste-management system, there would be no
         waste; every article of refuse could be reclaimed, just as
         in nature. Albany Lebanon Sanitation will always aim for
         that level of efficiency, and we welcome your suggestions
         for improving our service.</FONT>
