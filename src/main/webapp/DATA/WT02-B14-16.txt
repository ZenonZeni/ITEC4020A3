<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">INS: Budget and Apprehensions Up</h2>
<tt>The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced February 8, 1996 that
much of the department's FY96 budget of $2.6 billion will be spent to prevent
illegal immigration.  The INS budget was $1.5 billion in FY93.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will hire 500 new Border Patrol agents for the San Diego sector,
augmenting the over 1,660 agents already stationed there.  The INS will also
link its fingerprint IDENT system to its case ENFORCE system to more quickly
identify aliens previously caught.  The INS has been fingerprinting all persons
apprehended in San Diego since October 1994, and now has 550,000 fingerprints
in its computers.</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1996, apprehensions along the US-Mexican border were up 66
percent from January 1995, to 169,500.  About 40 percent of the apprehensions
were in California, 25 percent in Arizona, and 33 percent in Texas.  The
largest increase occurred in Arizona--apprehensions more than doubled between
January 1995 and January 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>According to Mexicans attempting to illegally enter the US, the cost of
being smuggled to Los Angeles is about $500, up from $200 to $300 in 1994.
Many unauthorized Mexicans hope to earn about $1,000 per month in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will more than double the number of workplace inspectors, from 317
to 701, and target employers in garment, agriculture, and other industries
known to employ unauthorized aliens.  The program under which employers
voluntarily submit information on newly hired aliens to the INS will be
expanded from 200 to 1,000 employers in the Los Angeles area.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles has already seen a sharp increase in worksite inspections.  On
February 5, the INS arrested 23 suspected illegal aliens in two clothing
factories in eastern Los Angeles, then hit a popular gathering site for day
laborers in the city of Industry.  Some aliens were apprehended as they visited
a mobile county health clinic. </tt><p>
<tt>Some critics worry that more interior inspections will lead to
discrimination against Asians and Latinos.  INS Commissioner Doris Meissner
says that the INS is emphasizing border enforcement to prevent illegal aliens
from entering the US, and targeting only employers who hire illegal aliens.
Meissner has said that interior enforcement is a vital part of the illegal
immigration issue and is "critical and importantly linked to border
enforcement."</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican government met with top INS officials on February 21 to discuss
their concerns that increased border enforcement could lead to the use of
excessive force and abuses of the human rights of Mexicans apprehended in the
US.  </tt><p>
<tt>On February 13, 1996, President Clinton signed the executive order that
bars companies that have knowingly hired illegal aliens from receiving federal
contracts for one year.  Of the 1,029 employers fined by the INS in FY95, 576
committed paperwork violations, and 453 had knowingly hired illegal alien
workers--only the 453 employers would be affected by the new order.</tt><p>
<tt>Being fined does not automatically mean loss of a federal contract.
Instead, the INS notifies the federal agency involved with the contractor, and
the federal agency may--but does not have to-- take the INS violation into
account when it decides whether to renew a contract.</tt><p>
<tt>Many observers expect construction and food service firms working under
federal contracts to be most affected by the executive order.  On February 11,
20 illegal workers were arrested while helping to construct a new federal
office building across the street from the INS office in downtown
Atlanta.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that additional funds will be made available to handle
the one million applications from aliens who applied to become US citizens in
1995.  The INS launched a CITIZENSHIP USA initiative in cities with many of the
naturalization applications, including Los Angeles and New York.</tt><p>
<tt>A poll of 412 adult Latinos in California released by the Tomas Rivera
Center, found that one-third favored more restrictions on immigration, and 40
percent supported the issuance of a national ID card to deter illegal
immigration.  Most of those polled support tough measures to deal with crime,
yet many mistrust the police.</tt><p>
<tt>A Roper poll of 1978 adults in December 1995 found that 83 percent of
respondents wanted fewer immigrants--people were asked whether the estimated
1.1 million entries in 1994--800,000 legal and 300,000 illegal-- should be
reduced.  Some 54 percent said they wanted less than 100,000 immigrants per
year.  About 20 percent of those polled wanted to stop immigration, and two
percent favored more immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>The Christian Science Monitor ran an eight-part series in February about
life on the US-Mexican border.  The second article explored the impact of
increased border enforcement on residents in eastern San Diego County.  As the
INS pushes illegal immigrants toward the remote eastern San Diego County,
residents are becoming more passionate about stopping immigration at the
border.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Presidential
Candidates on
Immigration</a></h2>
<tt>The surprising strength of Pat Buchanan in recent primaries will ensure
that immigration remains a key issue in 1996 presidential politics.  The
immigration issue will likely increase in importance as the Republican
presidential candidates woo California voters in the March 26 winner-take-all
primary.</tt><p>
<tt>Buchanan won the Louisiana primary, came in second to Senator Bob Dole
(R-KS) in Iowa, won the New Hampshire primary, and came in second or third in
the next three primaries.  Buchanan, campaigning in Arizona in late February,
promised to "halt the invasion" over the southern border with a fence and
troops within six months of becoming president.  Arizona's population is 20
percent Hispanic.  </tt><p>
<tt>Buchanan also promised to push for a five-year moratorium on
immigration--only spouses and children of US citizens would be admitted.
Buchanan opposes any kind of financial assistance for illegal aliens, and wants
to make English the official language of the United States.</tt><p>
<tt>Pundits noted that immigration brings together three GOP issues--crime,
illegal behavior, and welfare, and that Buchanan's rhetoric encouraged other
candidates to speak out on immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Lamar Alexander in January 1996 in San Francisco proposed that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service be replaced with a new branch of the
armed forces to patrol America's borders.  In the same statement he said that
the federal government should pick up the tab for illegal immigrants in states
such as Florida and California. </tt><p>
<tt>Bob Dole has promised to increase the size of the US Border Patrol and
streamline deportation procedures.  Dole opposes welfare benefits for illegal
immigrants.  In an April 1995 interview, Dole said that he thought Prop. 187
was a message to Washington that the American people have reached the limits in
paying for illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Steve Forbes, would like to increase legal immigration, and opposes the
registry concept endorsed by the CIR to deal with illegal immigration.  In July
1987, Forbes asserted that "You cannot be a great power without a large
population."  Forbes in 1995 wrote that "Legal immigrants have consistently
provided the US with energetic workers and entrepreneurs."</tt><p>
<tt>In 1985, Forbes asserted that the "The American Southwest would suffer a
depression without them  [illegal aliens]."</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Agricultural
Guest
Workers</a></h2>
<tt>In February 1995, the National Council of Agricultural Employers released a
proposal for a supplementary foreign worker program to fill temporary or
seasonal US jobs.  One year later, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) unveiled the NCAE
proposal as the "Alternative Agricultural Temporary Worker Program" or
"Temporary Agricultural Worker Amendments of 1995."  Its purpose is "to provide
a less bureaucratic alternative for the admission of temporary agricultural
workers."</tt><p>
<tt>Gallegly's proposal, to be offered as an amendment on the House floor in
March 1996, would permit growers, labor contractors, or associations wanting to
employ foreign farm workers to file at least 25 days before the job was to
begin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with their state Employment Service
office.  The House Agricultural Committee is expected to endorse the Gallegly
proposal at a hearing on March 7, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Employer LCAs would have to promise to pay the higher of the local
prevailing wage or the minimum wage; spell out working conditions, housing and
transportation arrangements that do not adversely affect local workers; and
promise to give preference to US workers who apply for jobs until five days
before work begins.  Local ES offices would review these LCAs "only for
completeness and obvious inaccuracies."</tt><p>
<tt>Farmers, labor contractors, or employer associations could apply for
workers, and the workers who could be employed under the program could be in
the US or abroad.   If the workers were outside the US, growers would submit
their names to INS and consulates abroad, and these named workers would be
given H-2B visas to enter the US at the consulates or at a port of entry.
Growers could recruit foreign workers anywhere and in whatever manner they
wished.  Foreign workers would have to leave the US when their jobs end or be
subject to deportation, unless another employer promises to hire them within 14
days. </tt><p>
<tt>To encourage workers to leave the US, 25 percent of the foreign workers'
wages would be placed into a federal trust fund, which foreign workers could
reclaim with interest in their country of origin.  Program costs would be
financed by contributions equivalent to social security and unemployment
insurance taxes that would not be paid by growers.</tt><p>
<tt>No one knows how many foreign workers might be requested under the Gallegly
proposal.  There are, at most, two million workers employed some time during
the year for wages on the nation's crop farms, and perhaps one million of them
work six months or more.  If 25 percent of the current farm work force consists
of unauthorized workers, and there is a one-for-one substitution between new
H-2B and unauthorized workers, then there may be 250,000 to 500,000 foreign
workers admitted under the Gallegly H-2B program each year.</tt><p>
<tt>If H-2B workers averaged $1,000 per month, then 500,000 workers employed
for an average six months would generate $3 billion in wages, of which $750
million would be withheld.  The employers who hired these workers would
contribute about nine percent of their wages to pay for the administration of
the program, or about $270 million per year.</tt><p>
<tt>The NCAE proposal is remarkable for the enormous differences between it and
the current H-2A program.  The H-2A requires farm employers wishing to employ
H-2A temporary foreign workers to take a series of steps to prove that US
workers are not available, and then to offer US and foreign workers housing at
no cost, contracts that guarantee work for at least three-fourths of the period
that the employer asserts workers are needed, and other benefits and
protections.  </tt><p>
<tt>The NCAE proposal, by contrast, extends the procedure used to admit H-1B
temporary foreign professionals to agriculture.  Under the H-1B program,
employers "attest" that they are paying prevailing wages and satisfying other
conditions so as to have no adverse effects on similar US workers, and then the
US Department of Labor relies on complaints from US workers and other employers
to investigate charges that employers are violating their attestations.</tt><p>
<tt>In February 1996, the agricultural guest worker issue is about where it was
in early 1984.  At that time, Congress was considering the legislation that
eventually became IRCA, and the major sponsors of the Simpson-Mazzoli
legislation, as well as the Reagan administration, were opposed to a special
agricultural program.  </tt><p>
<tt>In June 1984, Congress nonetheless adopted the Panetta-Morrison amendment
that would have established a free agent guest worker program for
agriculture--what the New York Times termed one of the top ten political
stories of 1984.  Then-Senator Pete Wilson (R-CA) persuaded the Senate to
approve a similar free agent program in 1985.</tt><p>
<tt>Two of the key allies of the growers in 1984-85 still influence immigration
policy.  Leon Panetta, who led the fight for the growers in the House, is
President Clinton's chief of staff, and Clinton reportedly assured California
farmers in September 1995 that "they would be taken care of" if labor shortages
developed.</tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson, who led the growers' fight in the Senate,
in an August 1995 session with the California Farm Bureau, asserted that he had
not changed his position since the mid-1980s.  The Wilson program would have
allowed foreign farm workers to "float" from farm to farm in the US, and
encouraged them to return to Mexico by withholding, according to Wilson,
one-third of their wages. </tt><p>
<tt>Wilson said it has been difficult to sell such a guest worker program
because of the public tendency to link illegal immigrants and guest workers.
Wilson said that, if he were President, he would expand the US Border Patrol to
reduce illegal immigration, and push to have a guest worker program
instituted.</tt><p>
<tt>The rationale for guest workers is that the labor market is not responding
properly to market signals such as rising wages, or that government
intervention is needed to prevent market adjustments that would have negative
effects, such as rising food prices.  However, if a new guest worker program
begins before any of these adjustments can be observed, it will never be known
how easily the farm labor market can adjust to changes in its labor
supply.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration and the House Judiciary Committee oppose
Gallegly's proposal, arguing it would only lead to more illegal immigration.
Fourteen organizations, from the American Friends Service Committee to the
United Methodist Church sent a letter to House Speaker Gingrich on February 14,
1996 opposing the Gallegly's proposal, and the effort to include it in the
immigration bill without hearings on its features.</tt><p>
<tt>About 60 farm organizations, from the American Farm Bureau Federation to
the Wisconsin Christmas Tree Producers sent a letter to senators and
representatives on February 12 to urge the inclusion of the Gallegly proposal
in immigration reform legislation.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Congress</a>Moves on Immigration
Reform</a></h2>
<tt>Congress is scheduled to debate on major reforms to US immigration law in
March 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to take up Sen. Alan Simpson's
(R-WY) S. 1394  bill on February 29, and the full House is expected to debate
the Immigration in the National Interest Act HR 2022 of Rep Lamar Smith (R-TX)
the week of March 18.</tt><p>
<tt>The Simpson bill would reduce the number of immigrants admitted for
employer/economic reasons from 140,000 to 90,000, and require US companies
seeking immigrants to fill vacant jobs to pay foreign workers five percent more
than the prevailing wage.  In some cases, business would also have to pay the
government a fee of $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreigner's salary, which ever
is higher, to train Americans to fill the jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill also modifies the system under which US employers can have
admitted to the US non-immigrant foreign workers who temporarily fill US jobs.
The US Department of Labor says that US employer applications for H-1B workers
rose 82 percent between 1992 and 1994.  Non-immigrant foreign workers are
concentrated in California and Florida--an estimated 35 percent of the computer
programmers in Silicon Valley were born abroad.  Simpson's bill would cap the
number of foreign H-1B workers at 65,000. </tt><p>
<tt>In urging swift passage of his bill, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) asserted that
"one-quarter of all federal prisoners are foreign born; ... one- quarter of
legal immigrants are on welfare."  The bill has 120 co-sponsors.</tt><p>
<tt>The Smith bill would enact new penalties for alien smuggling, build a
triple fence along 14 miles of Mexican border, streamline asylum, and authorize
another increase in the Border Patrol.  The bill would eliminate immigration
slots for adult brothers and sisters and most adult children of US citizens,
while increasing the number of wives and minor children of legal immigrants
allowed in legally each year. Legal immigration would be capped at 595,000 by
2002, down from 800,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Businesses prefer the Smith version because it keeps the number of
immigrants admitted for employer/economic reasons at 135,000 a year, and does
not impose fees.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most observers expect Congress to approve legislation that, inter alia,
step up efforts to reduce illegal immigration by adding more Border Patrol
agents and at least experiment with a system under which employers would be
required to check whether newly-hired workers are eligible to work in the US.
The number of legal immigrants would be reduced through the elimination of
immigration slots for adult brothers and sisters of US citizens, offset in part
by more immigration slots for the immediate families of immigrants in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>Opponents of immigration reform will first attempt to split comprehensive
immigration bills into legal and illegal components, in the hope that separate
bills can be tough on illegal immigration, but not drastically change the legal
immigration system.  Senator Simpson and Representative Smith countered efforts
to split their bills by arguing that Americans want reductions in BOTH legal
and illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare.</u>  The Senate Immigration Subcommittee on February 6, 1996
held a hearing on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) usage by immigrants.  SSI
is a federal program that provides $25 billion annually in federal benefits
that average $325 monthly to six million poor persons who are disabled or
elderly.  Since most US residents have US work experience, they obtain benefits
from Social Security rather than SSI.</tt><p>
<tt>Under immigration law, immigrants coming to the US must prove that they
have sufficient assets, or a US resident sponsor, so that they will not become
a public charge in the US.  In many cases, the US relatives of immigrants sign
affidavits that assert that the US resident will provide support for the
immigrant so that the immigrant will not need welfare.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Elderly</u>.  However, the courts have held that these affidavits of
support are not legally binding, so that especially elderly immigrants with few
assets, and no ability to earn a US income, apply for SSI despite the
affidavits signed by their often adult children who promised to support
them.</tt><p>
<tt>In testimony February 6, 1996, a Social Security Administration official
testified that the number of noncitizens receiving SSI increased from 128,000
in 1982 to 738,000 in 1994.  In 1996, one million resident aliens are expected
to be receiving SSI payments totaling $5 billion, and they are expected to
obtain an additional $9 billion in Medicaid payments.</tt><p>
<tt>US immigration law declares that aliens who become "public charges" within
five years of entry are deportable unless the reason for their application for
welfare occurred after their arrival.  Many welfare programs have a waiting
period during which newly arrived legal immigrants are not eligible for
benefits--three years for SSI, five years for other programs.   </tt><p>
<tt>Many non-US citizens apply for benefits as soon as this waiting period is
up--25 percent of non-citizens receiving SSI applied in their fourth year in
the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's bill would extend the period in which legal immigrants could not
get SSI and other benefits from three to 10 years, which means sponsors of
immigrants would have to promise to support their relatives for 10 years after
their arrival in the US.  Immigrants who received welfare payments for 12
months or more in any 60-month period would be subject to deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants can become US citizens after five years, so some proposals in
Congress would make aliens ineligible for benefits even if they became
naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Census reported that, in an average month of 1992, about 34 million
US residents --13 percent--were receiving benefits under one or more of seven
programs--AFDC, General Assistance, SSI, Medicaid, Food Stamps, Federal or
state rental assistance, and public housing.  In calendar years 1991-92, the
median duration of participation in these assistance programs was eight months,
and the average recipient got $436 per month from AFDC/GA, SSI, and Food
Stamps.</tt><p>
<tt>Almost two-thirds of the welfare recipients--20 million US residents--got
assistance in each of the 24 months of 1991-92.  About half of these long-term
recipients got Food Stamps.</tt><p>
<tt>It was reported that the foreign born account for eight percent of
households on public assistance and, because they tend to have larger families,
they receive 14 percent of federal benefits.  In California, foreign born
account for 21 percent of the households and receive 40 percent of the
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The US Census reported that about 13 percent of the nation's 4.2 million
foreign-born mothers received Food Stamps in 1993, versus 15 percent of the
31.5 million US-born mothers.  About one-fourth of all Hispanic mothers
received Food Stamps, versus 13 percent of non-Hispanic mothers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, 43 percent of refugees in the US received public
assistance.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum.</u>  One provision of both the House and Senate immigration
reform bills would require foreigners to apply for asylum within 30 days of
their arrival in the US.  Currently, an estimated five percent of asylum
applicants apply within 30 days of their arrival by completing an eight-page
I-589 form.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration opposes the 30-day limit.  It argues that
reforms already undertaken--doubling the number of asylum officers who hear
claims to 325--cut the number of new asylum applications in half, to 53,000 in
1995, and 95 percent of the new claims filed are dealt with within six
months--asylum applicants must wait six months for work permits.</tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Randy Tate (R-WA) has offered a bill that would make it impossible for
any who has tried to illegally enter the US to enter as a legal immigrant.  HR
2898, the One-Strike-You're-Out Immigration Act of 1996, has been embraced by
FAIR, which says that it would give aliens a good reason not to try to enter
illegally or overstay their visa. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Unions
and
Immigrants</a></h2>
<tt>The AFL-CIO met in New York in late October, 1995, and selected John Sweeny
of the 1.1 million-member Service Employees International Union to head the 13
million member AFL-CIO.  The US had 16.4 million union members in 1995, and
union members were 15 percent of the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweeny has made union organizing a high priority.  About 35 percent of US
nonfarm workers were union members in 1955, 24 percent in 1979, and 16 percent
in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The AFL-CIO pledged to spend $100 million on union organizing in 1996-97,
and announced a program under which the AFL-CIO would provide $1 for every $4
that its 78-member unions spend on organizing.  The AFL-CIO also welcomed back
into the federation the 117,000 National Health and Human Service Employees
Union, one of the most aggressive organizers, with 15 full-time
organizers.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of strikes involving 1,000 or more workers fell to 32 in 1995,
the lowest number in 50 years, and far below the 400 per year of the early
1950s and late 1960s.  The average duration of strikes has risen to an all-time
high of 53 days.</tt><p>
<tt>Several cities and unions are spearheading the organizing campaign.
Sweeny's SEIU reportedly spends 30 percent of its budget on organizing, has
organizers who speak 14 languages, and publishes information in a number of
Latin America and Asian languages.  The SEIU's organizing drives among janitors
and health care aides at the end of the 20th century are sometimes compared to
the efforts of manufacturing unions to organize factory workers at the
beginning of the century.</tt><p>
<tt>The SEIU is targeting health care workers; in many US cities, hospitals are
the largest private employers, and the US health care industry employs nine
million workers, half as many as US factories.  In California, the SEIU is
trying to organize the 160,000 home health care aides who, as independent
contractors, assist about 190,000 persons who live at home.  </tt><p>
<tt>The home health care aides have work<b> </b>contracts with the disabled
person whom they assist--the disabled person is their supervisor who signs
their time sheet.  The aides are paid $4.25 per hour and receive no benefits or
labor law protections.  The SEIU has dues of $7.38 per month deducted from the
$300 to $400 that most home health care aides earn.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The unions that represent workers in sewing shops, who are often
immigrants, merged in the summer of 1995 in UNITE--Union of Needletrades,
Industrial, and Textile Employees, a 300,000-member union headed by Jay Mazur.
UNITE runs an immigration assistance center and provides language classes for
members.</tt><p>
<tt>In Texas, most of the small-town garment shops that employed primarily
part-time women to sew garments have closed, with owners and workers blaming
everything from free trade and NAFTA to the failure of the US Department of
Labor to stamp out urban garment sweatshops.  The number of apparel jobs in the
US fell to 846,000 in 1995, down more than 10 percent from 945,000 in 1994.
Half of the apparel sold in the US is imported.</tt><p>
<tt>However, many of the unions that immigrants are most likely to come in
contact with have been charged with corruption.  The Laborers International
Union of North America, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
International; the International Longshoremen's Association, and the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters have been charged with being
corrupt.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles leads the list of cities in which many unions see new
members--only about 16 percent of the Los Angeles labor force belongs to
unions, versus 27 percent in New York City, and 24 percent in Detroit.  Instead
of organizing workers company-by-company, unions hope to use community-based
organizing--work with churches and other trusted institutions to make immigrant
workers aware of unions.  Los Angeles is considered ripe because although it
depends heavily on immigrant workers, who despite former reluctance to join
unions, are now receptive to organized labor. </tt><p>
<tt>On February 20, the AFL-CIO unveiled its new $35-million Reclaim America
campaign to get out the vote and to spur voters' support for issues important
to organized labor.  Most of the funds will be collected through a special 15
cent per member assessment that is expected to be approved at a special union
convention scheduled for March 25.   </tt><p>
<tt>Unions are leading a drive to increase the minimum wage state by state.
The federal minimum wage was last raised in 1991, to $4.25 per hour, although
some states, including California raised their minimum wages earlier.  Today,
about 20 percent of the states have minimum wages higher than $4.25--New
Jersey, at $5.05 is the highest.  </tt><p>
<tt>Despite President Clinton's call for a $5.15 minimum wage, the Republican
controlled Congress is unlikely to act.  Thus, unions and other supporters of a
minimum wage hike are gathering signatures to put initiatives on the ballots in
seven states, including California and Washington, that would raise the minimum
wage.  The California initiative, for example, would raise the state's minimum
wage from $4.25 to $5 in March 1997, and $5.75 in March 1998.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canada
Cracks Down on Immigrant
Sponsors</a></h2>
<tt>The Canadian government on December 14, 1995 promised to crack down on
residents<b> </b>who, after sponsoring the immigration of their relatives to
Canada, fail to provide for them.  Canadian residents are allowed to sponsor a
spouse, fianc&eacute;, dependent children, parents and grandparents for
immigration to Canada.  </tt><p>
<tt>New rules prevent residents from sponsoring immigrants if the Canadian
resident has received social assistance in the previous 12 months, is in
prison, or is facing trial on charges that could lead to deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>The metropolitan Vancouver area, with 1.8 million residents, is home to
300,000 people of Asian origin.  In communities such as Richmond, Asians are 30
percent of the population.  Most of the Asian immigrants are from Hong Kong and
Taiwan, and have been attracted to Canada by an immigration policy that favors
wealthy immigrants with investment funds.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 50 percent of the 57,000 students in Vancouver's public schools list
English as their second language.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a recent survey by Statistics Canada, immigrants from Hong
Kong invested about $6.5 billion in Canada between 1987 and 1991.  British
Columbia benefited from a tripling of direct investments from Asian countries
and the Pacific Rim is now the major source of foreign investment over the US
and the European Union.</tt><p>
<tt>As 1997 approaches, more Hong Kong residents are expected to move to
Canada.  The number of immigrants settling in British Columbia quadrupled
between 1986 and 1994, and the percentage of Asians among these immigrants rose
from 37 percent to 68 percent. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Mexico</a>Steps Up Southern Border Enforcement</a></h2>
<tt>Mexico stepped up enforcement on its southern border with Guatemala,
arresting an average 300 Central Americans and Asians per day at immigration
checkpoints in late January, double the number in 1995.  Central Americans who
fail to make it across the border are reportedly turning Tecun Uman, a
Guatemalan city of 20,000, into a staging area with more than 20,000
transients, coyotes and guides.</tt><p>
<tt>Getting illegally into Mexico is a lot easier than getting into the
US--usually only a quick trip on a homemade raft across the Suchiate River.
But once inside Mexico, non-Mexicans headed for the US reportedly suffer abuse
at the hands of the police and criminal gangs.  According to one priest: "There
are more human-rights violations here [Mexico] in one day than there are in a
year in the United States."</tt><p>
<tt>According to a regional Mexican official, border apprehensions have jumped
from 150 a day in January, 1995 to 250 a day in January 1996.  The Mexican
government claims that any military build-up at the border is for national
defense.  </tt><p>
<tt>In mid-February, leaders of the so-called Zapatista rebellion who took over
government offices in Chiapas January 1, 1994 agreed to sign an accord with the
Mexican government that spells out the rights of the 10 million Indians in
Mexico.  The agreement recognizes the right of Indians to "autonomy," which
means, inter alia, that Indians can use traditional forms of government in
their communities, and run for office without being members of a formal
political party.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's economy shrank by almost seven percent in 1995, and most
forecasters expect two to three percent growth in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico is considering ending tortilla subsidies, which cost 8.5 billion
pesos ($1.2 billion) in 1995, as Conasupo paid farmers high prices for corn,
and sold the corn at lower prices than it paid to tortilla makers.  One
company, Maseca or Mission Foods in the US, reportedly receives most of these
subsidies.  It allegedly used its close ties to the government to force a
switch in the way tortillas are made.  Instead of boiling corn kernels in water
and lime, and then grinding the pulp into dough (nixtamal), Maseca supplies
tortilla makers with corn flour.</tt><p>
<tt>The tortilla subsidies benefit mostly urban Mexican residents who can buy
subsidized tortillas.  Mexico's rural poor usually do not buy ready-made
tortillas.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans returning home from the US for the holidays in December reported
many encounters with bandits who robbed them and stole their cars.  This,
despite a program that increased federal patrols along north-south highways
traveled by tourists.  For years, Mexicans have been victims of bandits, and
they claim they are getting no police assistance because of corruption.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Teamsters Union began running radio ads in January 1996 that urged the
US to maintain the ban on Mexican trucks delivering goods in border states.
Cross-border trucking was scheduled to go into effect under NAFTA on December
18, but was delayed indefinitely by the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico says it is prepared to permit US trucks into Mexico, as NAFTA
stipulates, but most US experts expect the trucking ban to remain in place
until after the November 1996 US election.  US companies have complained that
Mexico is not letting them invest in Mexican trucking companies, as NAFTA
stipulates.  Under NAFTA, US companies can own up to 49 percent of Mexican
trucking companies that specialize in international transport--domestic
cabotage, or movements of goods within Mexico, remains off limits to foreign
investment.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration reportedly considered not certifying Mexico as a
country making sufficient progress to stop drug smuggling.  The US Foreign
Assistance Act requires the president to announce by March 1 of each year which
nations will  be officially listed, or certified, as cooperating in the effort
to halt drug trafficking.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Argentina</a>Beefs Up Employer
Sanctions</a></h2>
<tt>The Argentine government proposed to increase fines to $100,000, and jail
terms of up to six years, for employers who hire illegal foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 800,000 to one million foreigners working illegally in Argentina.
Most are from neighboring countries, including perhaps 500,000 Bolivians, and
foreign workers are maids, construction, or agricultural workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Argentina has a 16 percent unemployment rate, and many experts believe that
the government is scapegoating immigrants.  Some note that only four percent of
the residents of greater Buenos Aires are foreigners, but 20 percent are
internal migrants desperate for jobs.  Many employers prefer to hire workers
who will work outside the social security system--up to one third of
Argentina's employment is outside the social security system. </tt><p>

Immigration</a></h2>
<tt>On January 31, 1996 the last 124 Cubans left the US base at Guantanamo for
the US.  After Cubans and Haitians set out for the US in the summer of 1994,
the US erected a tent city at Guantanamo, on the eastern tip of Cuba, to house
some 29,000 Cubans and 21,000 Haitians who were picked up by the US Coast Guard
at sea in Operation Sea Signal.  Most of the Haitians were sent home, and most
of the Cubans came to the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Guantanamo base maintains materials to house up to 10,000 people in
future emergencies.</tt><p>
<tt>The Cuban exodus was halted by a US-Cuban agreement that guaranteed Cubans
at least 20,000 immigration visas annually, provided Cubans applied in
Havana--although the US reported in February 1996 that 280 Cubans have been
intercepted since May 1995 attempting to flee the island on small boats, or to
enter the Guantanamo base.  The Haitian exodus halted after President Aristide
was returned to power, and the US stood firm on its policy of not admitting
Haitians to the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Under an agreement with Cuba, the Bahamas will return Cuban boat people and
Cuba will accept them.  More than 30,000 Cubans who are detained or living in
the Bahamas will be returned.  The conditions and a timeline for the returned
have not be released.  Some of the Haitians and Cubans in the Bahamas were
employed as low-wage farm workers while there.</tt><p>
<tt>Cuban President Fidel Castro agreed to lower, in some needy cases, the fee
Cubans are charged for migrating to the US.  Castro agreed to lower fees for
1,000 cases immediately and an additional 1,000 cases each year.  The fees will
be lowered from $600 to $300 dollars.  The migration fees have meant that it
costs up to $900, including airfare to emigrate to the US.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">EU:
 Schengen and
Asylum</a></h2>
<tt>A summit aimed at getting France to implement the Schengen agreement's open
borders clause scheduled for March 7, 1996 was postponed after a French-Dutch
dispute over drugs--the French opposed the Dutch policy of allowing up to 30
grams of marijuana to be sold in 300 coffee shops.  </tt><p>
<tt>In another blow to Schengen, Spain suspended its participation in the
extradition treaty after Belgium freed two alleged Basque terrorists.  The
Schengen agreement came into force among six EU nations in March 1995.
Currently, only Germany, Portugal, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are operating
a full open borders policy with other Schengen nations.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of requests for asylum in Europe in 1995 declined.  The decrease
has been gradual since 1992, when there was a record 674,000 requests, compared
to only 305,000 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain in the only country in Europe where the number of asylum
applications is still rising.  There were 44,000 asylum applications in Britain
in 1995, up 12,000 from 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>The EU in February 1996 postponed plans to make occupational pensions
portable, citing interference with member nations' pension programs.
Government-run pension programs are already coordinated, but not
employer-provided supplements, which often exceed government pensions.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is considered the major obstacle to EU-wide employer pensions.  To
promote loyalty to a firm, Germany "vests" or makes portable pension benefits
only after 10 years of employment.  This discourages worker mobility.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany argues that there is no need to reduce the vesting period to five
years because only two percent of the EU's workers are nationals of one country
employed in another.  Critics counter that it is precisely because of pension
rules such as Germany's that there are so few intra-EU migrant workers.</tt><p>

<tt>The interior ministers of Germany's 16 states met January 26, 1996 and
agreed to begin to return the 320,000 Bosnians in Germany to Bosnia on July 1,
1996.  Bosnians without families in Germany are expected to leave by June 30,
1997; other Bosnians are expected to be out of Germany by August 31, 1997.
Most of the 70,000 Croatians who fled to Germany have returned.</tt><p>
<tt>Under German law, the 16 interior ministers have considerable discretion in
arranging for the return of Bosnians.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 12,050 asylum applications in Germany in January 1996, including
2,400 each from the ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey.  Germany changed its asylum law
and procedures on July 1, 1993, and the number of foreigners applying for
asylum in Germany was about 127,000 in 1994 and 1995, down sharply from 322,
599 in 1993 and 430,191 in 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>The chairman of the opposition Social Democrat (SPD), Oskar Lafontaine, was
criticized by the ruling government parties for suggesting in the run-up to
state elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and
Schleswig-Holstein on March 26 that ethnic Germans were overburdening the
German job market and welfare system.  According to Lafontaine, "A million
people have come as job-seekers and it's about time to stop this influx,
otherwise we'll have 100,000 more unemployed at the end of the year."</tt><p>
<tt>About two million ethnic Germans have emigrated from the former East Bloc
to Germany since 1989, and four million ethnic Germans still live in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.  In 1995, some 217,898 ethnic Germans
arrived in Germany, down from 222,591 in 1994.  Some 100,000 Germans in eastern
Europe have valid  immigration documents that would permit them to move to
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The German Parliament on February 9 approved laws aimed at reducing the
number of foreign workers on German construction sites.  The new laws will
enforce minimum wage and social security payments for all employees effective
March 1, 1996.  Companies found violating the new law could be blacklisted from
public works contracts.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some construction supervisors predict that the new law will force thousands
of foreign construction workers into the black economy--one German employer
noted that the total costs of hiring an illegal foreign worker can be as little
as 5 DM per hour, versus 60 DM to 80 DM per hour for a German.  On February 14,
1996, German authorities inspected a major construction site in Berlin, taking
away some of the foreign workers for questioning, and promising more
raids.</tt><p>
<tt>At most construction sites, the foreman is German, the skilled workers are
British and Irish, the hod-carriers are Portuguese, and the laborers are Poles.
</tt><p>
<tt>European Union officials believe that there is enough support, despite
British opposition, to pass an EU law ensuring that EU workers seeking
employment in other EU nations receive the same pay and conditions as local
employees as of the first day they are employed abroad.  The four year old
proposal is getting a new look because of complaints of "social dumping" in
German construction.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the EU's freedom of services proviso, the company leasing the
low-cost workers is providing a cross-border service to the firm that actually
employs the worker.  France, the Benelux, and now Germany have national laws
that require such "seconded" workers to be paid at least the local minimum wage
from their first day of work--some EU countries want a one to three month
period during which workers from other EU nations can be paid less.</tt><p>
<tt>Under EU voting procedures, Britain must have the support of two other
large countries to veto the proposed regulations.</tt><p>
<tt>On January 30, 1996, Germany announced a 50-point plan to stimulate
investment and create jobs.  Germany in January 1996 had 35 million employed
and 4.2 million unemployed workers--10.8 percent of the labor force was
jobless, and one-fourth of those without jobs are 55 or older.  To persuade
long-term unemployed workers to accept jobs, assistance payments will be
reduced for each year of joblessness.</tt><p>
<tt>Many companies reportedly lay off older workers so that they can push the
cost of older workers onto the government--laying off a worker over 55 costs
the German unemployment/welfare systems an average $150,000, of which the
employer pays less than 10 percent.  German workers are eligible to draw state
pensions at age 58.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a great deal of debate over how to create jobs and reduce
joblessness.  One issue is termination.  In the US, a worker who is permanently
laid off when a plant shuts typically gets one week of severance pay for each
year of employment--in Germany, the ratio is one month's pay for each year of
employment, or four times more.</tt><p>
<tt>When a firm lays off 10 percent or more of its workers, the employer must
work out a social plan with the plant's workers' council-- a group of elected
workers--and an interest reconciliation, which means that a company closing a
plant must try to sell the plant to another buyer to preserve jobs, or give the
workers a chance to buy it.</tt><p>
<tt>According to some US companies operating in Germany, the cost of "bribing"
workers to agree to job cuts discourages US and other foreign investment in
Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many employers want Germany to permit five-year and other limited-term
contracts, which would enable employers to dismiss workers after a fixed period
without giving a reason or paying severance.  Under German law, employers and
workers can agree to one maximum 18 month contract--employers want 24 month
contracts that could be renewed.  About six percent of West Germany's workers,
and 12 percent of the East's workers, are on fixed time contracts.</tt><p>
<tt>Most Germans reject labor market deregulation that, they argue, might
create a class of so-called working poor residents in low-wage jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 226,000 foreigner-owned businesses in Germany in 1993, almost
double the number in 1988.  Half of these foreigner-owned businesses were
restaurants, and Turks owned about one in six foreign-owned businesses.</tt><p>
<tt>Some four million Germans are receiving social assistance--about one-third
of them are long-term unemployed.  Poverty in Germany is defined as an income
of less than half the average income of all households.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC14">Britain</a>More Safe
Countries</a></h2>
<tt>The controversial Asylum and Immigration Bill passed 280 to 250 on February
22, 1996 in the House of Commons.  The bill will now be considered by the House
of Lords.  Britain may add to its "white list" of nations deemed safe from
political persecution Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya--some 3,000 nationals of
these countries applied for asylum in the UK in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The current list of safe countries includes Bulgaria, Cyprus, India, Ghana,
Pakistan, Poland and Romania.  Nationals of safe countries can apply for asylum
in the UK, but the burden of proof is on them to show that, contrary to the
general absence of political persecution, in this case, the applicant was
persecuted.</tt><p>
<tt>New regulations went into effect on February 5, 1996 that require
applicants for asylum to apply at the port of  entry if they want to obtain
welfare benefits.  Applicants whose claims are rejected are not allowed to
collect benefits during the appeal. </tt><p>
<tt>However, posters in English, Turkish, French and Spanish warning refugees
at Heathrow Airport that they must immediately register or risk being deported
have been banned by the British Airports Authority as "too political."</tt><p>
<tt>A judge prevented the implementation of the welfare ban--there will now be
a trial on its legality.  Another court will decide in mid-February whether the
British government should be prevented from enforcing the regulations.  The
government argues that the burden of proof is on asylum applicants to prove
that they deserve refugee status and welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related ruling, a Court of Appeal ruled that the Westminster housing
authority is under a statutory duty to house nationals from other EU countries
who entered the UK lawfully to work, have not been told to leave, and who are
now unemployed and homeless.  The ruling is expected to be appealed to the
House of Lords. </tt><p>
<tt>Saudi dissident Mohammed al-Masari argued before an immigration appeals
court on February 23, 1996 that his life would be in greater risk in Dominica,
where the British government plans to deport him, than in Britain.  </tt><p>
<tt>The island nation of Dominica has acknowledged that it agreed to accept the
Saudi dissident in exchange for financial aid and a guaranteed market for its
bananas.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of British unions has fallen from about 500 in the mid-1970s to
250 in 1995, and the number of union members fell from a peak 13.5 million in
1979 to about nine million today.  Unions are strongest in Britain's public
sector--62 percent of public employees in the UK are union members, versus 23
percent of private employees.</tt><p>
<tt>The Conservatives, who have governed the UK since 1979, enacted laws that
e.g., required secret postal ballots before unions could call strikes, outlawed
secondary strikes in one company to put pressure on another company, and ended
closed shops, which required workers to be union members before working in
certain workplaces.  These laws are likely to remain in place if Labour comes
to power in the next election, but British unions hope that a new government,
plus EU labor legislation, will require employers to formally adopt workplace
representation plans.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Spain</a>'s Grand Bargain</a></h2>
<tt>Spain announced new measures on February 1 to crack down on illegal aliens
in the country, and to make it harder for non-EU visitors to get visas to enter
Spain.</tt><p>
<tt>At the same time, Spain announced a plan to permit aliens who have spent at
least six years in the country on temporary permits to become permanent
residents, a liberalization pushed by unions and immigrant rights
groups.</tt><p>
<tt>About one third of the 500,000 immigrants residing in Spain will be
eligible for permanent-resident status, which allows them to have their
children join them in Spain.</tt><p>
<tt>Spanish police announced on October 16 that they had broken up a network of
Chinese restaurant owners who illegally smuggled 100 Chinese immigrants into
the country over the past four years.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The immigrants were flown to Moscow, taken by train to Prague,
smuggled across the border from the Czech Republic into Germany, and then taken
to Spain.  The illegal Chinese immigrants would work in restaurants, garment
factories or in prostitution in conditions of semi-slavery.</tt><p>
<tt>Thousands of illegal immigrants arrive in Spain each year, paying up to
2,000 pounds for a trip from Africa to the southernmost point in Europe, the
beach of Tarifa in Spain.  Officials estimate the number of aliens arriving on
Spain's southern shores at about 50,000 in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>Once an illegal immigrant lands on Spanish soil, he cannot be sent them
back to Morocco, because that country refuses boat people who may have embarked
from there.  Many of the aliens live in tents or hostels, where they are free

<a name="RTFToC16">Italy</a>:
Immigration Decree Not Enough</a></h2>
<tt>The Interior minister who issued Italy's immigration decree that called for
the immediate expulsion of illegal immigrants in early February called the
decree inadequate.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the November 19, 1995 decree, illegal immigrants accused of a crime
can be deported immediately, while other illegal immigrants are served with
expulsion orders that give them 10 days to leave.  Immigrants allegedly use
these 10 days to disappear, or to begin endless appeals.</tt><p>
<tt>Since the new decree was issued, about 2,000 expulsion orders were issued,
but, according to the ex-minister, probably no aliens were expelled.  In 1995,
about 56,000 expulsion orders were issued, and 7,400 aliens were
expelled.</tt><p>
<tt>The Italian government can re-issue the decree, or the Parliament can enact
it into law.  The failure of the Parliament to act is the explanation offered
for why only 74,400 illegal aliens regularized their status since November 19,
1995, when aliens who made social security payments and got letters from their
employers could become legal immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>On February 3, between 10,000 to 30,000 immigrants demonstrated in Rome
against racism and called for the withdrawal of the November decree.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Czech
Republic Faces Labor
Shortages</a></h2>
<tt>A very low unemployment rate is slowing down the expansion of the free
market system in the Czech Republic.  Employees are constantly being wooed away
to higher-paying jobs, leading to high job turnover. </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently about 27,000 Ukrainians illegally employed in the Czech
Republic, Ukrainians rank second behind Slovaks.  Czech businesses have said
that once the Czech Republic completes its restructuring, it will turn to the
Ukraine for guest workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Republic and the Ukraine already have a guest worker agreement.
In addition to a 12-month pass, the Czech government will introduce three- and
six-month permits for seasonal workers, and project-specific permits for
employees of Ukrainian firms contracted for jobs in the Czech Republic.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Republic is considering a change in its citizenship law to remove
the requirement that applicants for naturalization have a clean criminal record
for five years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Europe and Helsinki Commission criticized Czech citizenship
law on February 21 for causing thousands of residents who previously held
Czechoslovak citizenship to become "aliens."  Slovakians are considered
foreigners in the new Czech Republic, and many Slovak Romanies living in the
Czech Republic are unable to acquire Czech citizenship because they have
criminal records.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Slovakians were labeled criminals by the Czech Republic because
they had a police file--though the Czech government admits that a police file
did not mean a person collaborated with the secret police.  The citizenship law
bans from public office everyone registered in the secret police files,
regardless of whether they worked for or cooperated with the secret police.
</tt><p>
<tt>An opinion poll by the state-funded Institute for Public Opinion Research
of 1,022 Czechs found that about one-third do not like other races,
particularly Gypsies, Germans, and Vietnamese.  More than one quarter of the
respondents thought that there should be stricter laws on foreigners visiting
and conducting business in the Czech Republic.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Thailand Proposes Guest Workers</a></h2>
<tt>Thailand's interior ministry has proposed a plan to permit employers in 35
of the country's 76 provinces to import foreign workers.  The provinces in
which foreign workers would be allowed include Bangkok, the border regions, and
coastal provinces.</tt><p>
<tt>If approved by the labor ministry and the cabinet, employers would register
their foreign workers by paying a Baht 5,000 ($200) deposit per worker, and a
Baht 1,000 per worker fee.  Foreign workers would have to be paid the Thai
minimum wage.  There are an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 mostly illegal foreign
workers in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>A pilot program involving deposits and fees failed because many foreign
workers disappeared, so their employers forfeited their deposits.</tt><p>
<tt>Some in the government proposed to allow illegal immigrants already in the
country to register for work with the Employment Division, but the Thai
employment department director countered that illegal foreign workers should be
allowed to work only in provinces with acute labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the recommended plan, illegal immigrants would report to the
immigration police, and then be registered by the labor ministry prior to legal
employment.  Work permits would be valid for two years, and could be extended.
</tt><p>
<tt>Employers must register each foreign worker with the employment department,
and pay a 5,000 baht guarantee.  Employers caught with illegal workers could
face up to three years in jail or a fine of not exceeding 60,000 baht or both.
Each employer will be allowed to have a maximum half of his work force consist
of registered foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai government estimates that there at least 330,000 Burmese, 100,000
Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi, 100,000 Chinese, and more than 10,000 Khmer
or Laotian workers in the country.  Brokers are paid between 3,000 to 5,000
baht for each migrant they bring to factories in Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>Several Thai labor councils have objected to the foreign workers plan
because it could mean fewer job opportunities for native workers.  One member
of Parliament suggested the foreign workers be restricted to industries that
Thais avoid, such as fisheries and pig and chicken farms. </tt><p>
<tt>The Labour and Social Welfare Ministry has agreed to expand from nine to 22
the provinces who will be allowed to recruit foreign workers for fishing.
Before trawler owners may legally hire foreign workers, the Fisheries
Department must amend the Fishing Rights Act.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Indonesian
Workers in Malaysia</a></h2>
<tt>Malaysia's "easy exit" for illegal aliens, which began February 3, 1996
during the Hari Raya festival week, attracted few takers.  In response, the
Malaysian government extended the program until the end of February. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government estimates that 40,000 Indonesians have overstayed
their visas.  Under Ops Check-Out, these Indonesians can pay a fine of RM 1,000
or $400 for entering the country illegally or staying without proper permits
(the normal penalty is RM 3,000); pay for the return trip home; and be
fingerprinted--they can then leave Malaysia legally.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government admitted that many Indonesians may not have signed up for
fear of being unable to return to Malaysia later due to the finger-printing
requirement. </tt><p>
<tt>In early February, police in Kuala Lumpur detained 1,600 foreigners
suspected of being illegally in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The government announced that a total of 608,000 foreigners were registered
with the Immigration Department in early 1996-- 249,185 Indonesian nationals,
79,688 Bangladeshis, 1,999 Pakistanis, 21,870 Thais, 26,049 Filipinos and
229,431 other nationals.  The three major sectors of legal foreigners
employment were plantations, with 180,688 foreigners, manufacturing 177,252,
and maids, 117,203.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Cabinet approved a fee structure for Indonesian maids.  Under
the new agreement with Indonesia, maids will pay RM 300 ($115) there for
"training" before their departure for Malaysia.  </tt><p>
<tt>If Indonesian recruiters attempt to pass this fee onto Malaysian households
that employ them, the government may expand the source counties of maids from
the current Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand to also include Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysian households already pay a fee of RM 1,870 to the Malaysian
government to receive permission to hire foreign maids, plus RM 500 to a
Malaysian recruitment agency to find them a foreign maid.  Indonesian maids
will have to pay RM 1,083 to recruitment agencies in Jakarta for placement fees
and services such as documentation, health examination, training, visa and
transportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Indonesian maids must be paid a minimum RM 350 ($135) per month in
Malaysia, or RM 450 if they have experience.  The Philippines requires Filipina
maids to be paid a minimum RM 500 ($190) per month.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government changed their policy of not granting work permits
to the spouses of foreign workers.  In granting work permits to spouses, the
government argued that the foreign spouses are already at home in Malaysia and
that it would be better than employing "strangers." </tt><p>
<tt>In an effort to eliminate the need for foreign workers at gas (petro)
stations, the first phase of installing 514 self service stations will be
completed in January, 1997.  The approximately 5,000 foreign workers now
employed as petrol kiosk attendants will lose their jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>A 1995 report by a non-governmental organization called Tenaganita
criticized the detention camps that hold illegal foreign workers as
"concentration camps."  The report detailed physical abuse, poor food and
sanitation and a lack of medical care.  The government admitted that 40 foreign
workers died in the camps in 1995.  Since the report, doctors visit the camps
weekly, and water is available all the time.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC21">Taiwan:
Foreign
Workers</a></h2>
<tt>Taiwan has approved the entry of 290,000 foreign workers, and at the end of
October, 1995, there were about 193,000 foreign workers in Taiwan, including
131,000 Thais and 55,000 Filipinos.  Taiwan's unemployment rate is expected to
rise to 2.5 percent in 1996, prompting the government to slow down the entry of
foreigners.</tt><p>
<tt>A union official asserted that, in the six years since Taiwan permitted the
entry of foreign workers, some 450,000 have arrived or received approval to
work in Taiwan.  Some of the foreign workers have already departed, as have
some of the 90,000 illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 18,000 foreign workers were reported to have abandoned their
contracts, and 6,600 were apprehended.  Between January and October 1995, 390
foreign workers were arrested by police on criminal charges.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council of Labor Affairs has decided to allow some legal foreign
workers who lose jobs because of plant shutdowns to change jobs; they will be
allowed to go to work for affiliated companies who have received permission to
hire foreign workers, but have not yet brought them to Taiwan.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Taipei city government is proposing stiffer penalties for employers who
hire illegal immigrants.  Officials estimate that nearly 11,800 legitimately
hired foreign workers have fled their jobs and overstayed their visas in
Taiwan.  There are an additional 18,000 foreign workers in Taiwan. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC22">Hong Kong</a> Emigration Drops</a></h2>
<tt>In February 1996, the number of days until the Chinese takeover of Hong
Kong became less than 500.  Unexpectedly, in 1995, emigration dropped to its
lowest level in six years.  In 1995, 43,000 people left the British colony,
compared to 62,000 in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some officials predict the emigration in 1996 will be only slightly higher
than in 1995.  Other experts predict that the number of people emigrating from
Hong Kong will reach 90,000 to 100,000 in 1996, and may reach 200,000 by July
1, 1997, versus 43,000 in 1995 and 62,000 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 10 percent of Hong Kong's 6.3 million residents could leave,
i.e., up to 600,000 have foreign passports.  Hong Kong's population rose by
160,000 in 1995, in part because of the immigration of 150 mainland Chinese
each day and more births than deaths.  An increase in foreign domestic helpers
and Hong Kong returnees also contributed to the rise.  </tt><p>
<tt>Pregnant mainland Chinese women come to Hong Kong to have their babies; in
1995, about 240 babies were born to "illegal mainlanders" each month. The
Chinese women hope that their children, by being born in Hong Kong, will have a
better chance of gaining residency there.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government has announced that it will no longer give permits to
pregnant women to enter Shenzhen's Shatoujiao restricted zone, from where most
of the women cross to Hong Kong.  The women wait until birth is imminent, cross
the border, and run to the nearby fire station.  The firemen are obligated to
take the women to the hospital.  </tt><p>
<tt>After birth, most of the women are repatriated to China, leaving their
newborns with their Hong Kong resident fathers.  Once in China, they can apply
for permits to return, but most must wait 10, 20 or 40 years to rejoin their
family.  Some mothers are allowed back into Hong Kong temporarily on visitors
visas. </tt><p>
<tt>One Hong Kong judge has said he will try to stop the incarceration of
pregnant illegal immigrants because he does not feel it is proper for the
babies to be kept in prison with their mothers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The head of the Illegal Immigrant Control Center in Hong Kong reports that
snakeheads, who have been smuggling CD-Roms, computer software and drugs
between Hong Kong and China, are now smuggling pregnant women into Hong
Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey by the Hong Kong Association for Continuing Education gives poor
marks to education courses designed to help mainland Chinese children integrate
into Hong Kong society.  The association surveyed 50 voluntary agencies that
provided newly-arrived mainland children with four to six week English courses.
</tt><p>
<tt>More than 90 percent of the 535 replies from parents, students and
teachers, said the courses did not offer age and ability-appropriate education.
Many children complained that it they had to search for a school that would
take them--some were rejected by up to 20 schools. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">Filippin</a>Recruitment</a></h2>
<tt>Under Philippine law, agencies that arrange for Filipinos to work abroad
cannot charge the workers more than 5,000 pesos ($200).  Most workers pay far
more for foreign jobs--the going rate for going to Hong Kong as a maid is
25,000 pesos, and 60,000 pesos for a job in Taiwan.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines is also considering exempting maids working abroad from
paying Philippine income taxes.  With workers in over 40 countries, many
Filipinos abroad learn that they must pay income taxes on their earnings both
to their host country and to the Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>After returning forcibly on February 14, 1996 at least one of 84 Vietnamese
from a camp that opened in 1978, the Philippines reversed course and announced
that the last of the 2,700 Vietnamese in the country who refused to return
could stay in the country.  There are still 36,000 Vietnamese in camps around
southeast Asia, and in January 1996, the Philippines agreed with Hong Kong,
Malaysia, and Thailand to return the remaining Vietnamese in 1996.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Migration in Africa</a></h2>
<tt>In 1972, Idi Amin expelled most of the 70,000 Asians--who ran 90 percent of
Uganda's businesses--from the country.  Uganda became an economic back
water--its 18 million people in 1995 had an annual per capita income of less
than $200.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, Asians were allowed to return or file claims for their lost
assets, and 7,000 have returned, investing perhaps $500 million of the $2
billion in foreign investment in Uganda over the past five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Kenya in November, 1995 swept hotels and other housing in Nairobi and
detained foreigners who allegedly were in the country illegally.  Kenya
announced that many illegal foreigners were involved in criminal
activities.</tt><p>
<tt>Men who migrate from interior areas of the sub-Sahara to coastal cities for
work are bringing AIDS home.  In many villages of Niger and Burkina Faso, where
up to 80 percent of the working age males migrate to Abidjan, Accra, Lome, and
Lagos, and polygamy is common, AIDS is believed to be spread from the coastal
cities to the interior by migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Zaire in February stepped up the pressure on Rwandans living in 40 camps in
Zaire to return to Rwanda.  The Kibumba camp, with 190,000 Rwandans, was closed
in mid-February when Zairian troops surrounded it to put economic pressure on
Rwandans to return.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hutu camps in Zaire were established 19 months ago, and have since
developed extraordinarily sophisticated markets, according to refugee
officials.  For example a 1995 survey of four camps in Goma found 82,000
businesses, including 2,300 bars and 450 restaurants, sometimes stocked with
war booty brought from Rwanda for what Hutu leaders thought might be a long
exile.  Zairian authorities have closed the Hutu businesses, on the grounds
that they do not pay local taxes. </tt><p>
<tt>At the request of Mozambique, the South African Cabinet on February 21,
1996 agreed to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants from Southern African
Development Community countries if they have been in South Africa for five
years.  Illegal aliens from Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia and the
island of Mauritius who have been in South Africa for five years, had a formal
or informal job, or a relationship with a South African spouse or child, could
receive permission to stay.</tt><p>
<tt>South Africa repatriated 72,000 people to Mozambique in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated three million illegal immigrants are in South Africa
and the government contends that they are creating a problem with cross-border
drug dealings. </tt><p>
<tt>South Africa and Botswana deported more than 24,000 Zimbabweans between
January and November, 1995.  According to South African police, most of the
illegal immigrants were searching for employment, while some were trying to
escape the police. </tt><p>

cut immigrant numbers if his coalition won the March 2 election.  Howard lost

limit would not apply to foreign employees in the government sector or to

<tt>This report says that some 800,000 Asian women leave their country of
nationality for foreign jobs each year, and that they stay abroad an average
two years, so that about 1.5 million mostly Indonesian, Filipina, Sri Lankan,
and Thai women are employed as maids and entertainers in Asia and the Middle
East.  In some labor-importing countries, half of the Asian women are working
illegally.</tt><p>
<tt>The report places much of the blame for the migration of women, and the
conditions in which they live and work, on labor contractors and brokers, who
are involved in the migration of 90 percent of all Asian women:  "Were it not
for illegal recruitment agencies...Asian labor migration would not have reach
such a massive scale."  The majority of women migrating for jobs from Indonesia
and Sri Lanka do so illegally.</tt><p>
<tt>However, sending countries can do little to police labor brokers--the
