PRPs to bid Waste Inc. dump cap 

     PRPs are expected to solicit bids this spring or summer for the 
construction of an $11.3 million capping and leachate collection project at 
the Waste Inc. NPL site in Michigan City, Ind.
     A group of 16 PRPs known as the Waste Inc. Remedial Action 
Organization Group (WIROG) agreed last week to comply with an EPA 
unilateral order to design and build the remedy. 
     The 1994 ROD calls for capping most of the 32-acre landfill with two to 
four feet of compacted clay and one foot of topsoil. The cap will be graded 
and vegetated. 
     A leachate collection trench also will be needed at the southwest end of 
the landfill. Groundwater, which has polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 
PCBs, will be monitored.
     Also, an on-site well will need to be abandoned, an underground fuel 
storage tank removed and a sewer system rerouted.
     Capital costs were estimated at $11.3 million under the ROD, with 
another $290,000 needed for annual operation and maintenance.
     Montgomery Watson's Addison, Ill., office is managing the site for the 
PRPs and will do the design. A design work plan is due Feb. 5. The 
consultant also is expected to handle the construction bid solicitations.
     The design is expected to be completed this spring or summer. Pre-
construction work could begin as early as April.

Bids near for CryoChem g.w. fix

     EPA is expected to solicit bids this spring for the construction of a 
groundwater treatment plant at the CryoChem Inc. NPL site in Worman, Pa.
     CH2M Hill Inc.'s Reston, Va., office is managing the fund-lead site as 
the agency's Alternative Remedial Contracts Strategy (ARCS) contractor. 
The design is at the 30% phase and is scheduled for completion in the 
spring. Construction is slated to begin this summer.
     Groundwater at the site will be extracted and treated with air stripping. 
Extraction and monitoring wells were installed last fall, and bids will be 
solicited for the construction of the on-site treatment building only. 
     Groundwater will be extracted at a maximum rate of 100 gallons per 
minute and discharged to an on-site creek.
     Groundwater samples taken between 1981 and 1985 at the 19-acre 
metal fabricating plant site revealed on-site and off-site contamination. The 
primary contaminants are TCA, DCA, TCE, DCE and PCE.

C&D Recycling pre-design starts

     PRPs have begun sampling as part of pre-design work for a $12 million 
soil and sediment cleanup at the C&D Recycling NPL site in Foster 
Township, Pa.
     ERM Northeast will design the remedy for AT&T, which is paying for 
the work under a unilateral administrative order. Other PRPs were identified 
by EPA but AT&T is the only one that complied with the order.
     Under the September 1992 ROD, about 30,000 cubic yards of soil and 
sediment will be excavated, stabilized and hauled off-site for disposal.
     The prime contaminants are heavy metals, primarily lead and copper.
     Design work is scheduled for completion in July 1997.
     The 45-acre site operated as metals reclamation plant from the 1960s 
until the early 1980s. Lead- and plastic-cased telephone cables were burned 
in pits to melt off the lead and reclaim the remaining copper wire. Plastic 
coverings were mechanically stripped prior to the burning and stored in 
piles at the site.
     The state found high concentrations of lead and copper in ash piles, the 
burn pit and drainage pathways.

AT&SF source removal eyed  

     EPA received a draft engineering evaluation/cost analysis (EE/CA) 
report Jan. 16 from PRPs at the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co. 
(AT&SF) NPL site in Albuquerque, N.M., where a source soil and sludge 
removal likely is needed.
     The EE/CA is part of an RI/FS by Radian Corp. of Houston. Radian is 
doing the work for AT&SF, the only PRP identified by EPA.
     Possible removal options include excavation with off-site treatment of 
sludge and excavation, storage and on-site treatment of sludge with the rest 
of the site's contaminated soil. Contaminated soil extends to depths of 
about 40 feet, and the contamination has reached the bedrock aquifer.
     Sludge extends to depths of 1.5 feet to two feet. Earlier studies 
estimated about 1,000 cubic yards of sludge had to be addressed.
     The New Mexico Environment Dept. has the oversight lead at the site, 
which is an abandoned wood-preserving plant in the South Valley area of 
Albuquerque. Except for a waste water impoundment and sump, the plant 
was dismantled in 1972.

California Gulch capping eyed

     As expected, Asarco Inc. last week submitted a feasibility study for the 
Apache tailings operable unit at the California Gulch NPL site in 
Leadville, Colo., where about 600,000 cubic yards of tailings likely will 
need to be capped.
     The tailings could be capped with either soil or an impermeable clay 
layer at an estimated cost of between $1 million and $2 million, depending 
on which material is selected. The nature of the cap will be delineated 
during design.
     Asarco has not decided whether it will keep on Golder Associates 
Ltd., which did the RI/FS, to do the design or bid out the work. A decision 
is expected once the ROD is signed this spring. Asarco hopes to complete 
the work this summer.
     Community protection measures, such as blood lead screening, are 
expected for the residential soils operable unit. An FS for the unit is 
expected by the end of next month.
     Other operable units at the site are being addressed by Resurrection 
Mining Co. and Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (Superfund Week 
1/12).

More studies near at Valleycrest

     PRPs have completed sampling under the first phase of an RI at the 
North Sanitary Landfill NPL site (also called the Valleycrest Landfill) in 
Dayton, Ohio. The results are due next month.
     Phase two RI work will begin soon thereafter. During the first phase of 
the RI, about 10 groundwater monitoring wells were installed, along with 18 
soil gas probes. Landfill gas and geophysical surveys also were taken. 
     The geophysical surveys detected off-site burial areas, and much of 
second round of studies will focus on delineating those areas.
     The prime contaminants are volatile organic compounds, metals and 
semi-volatiles.
     TreaTek-Conestoga Rovers & Associates is doing the RI for a group 
of PRPs that agreed to an RI/FS last spring (Superfund Week 4/14/95). 
Parties agreeing to the investigations include General Motors Corp., 
AT&T Global Information Solutions, Cargill Inc., Duriron Co., 
Standard Register, Dayton Walther Co. and Peerless Transportation 
Co. Another 38 PRPs have been identified but have so far refused to step 
forward.
     de maximis inc. of Livonia, Mich., is managing the cleanup for the 
PRPs.

Bloomington cleanup plans near

     EPA, the Indiana Dept. of Environmental Management and PRP 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. are expected to give a U.S. District Court a 
schedule next month for the cleanup of up to five PCB sites in 
Bloomington, Ind.
     Alternatives to incineration, which was selected for the sites in a 1985 
ROD, are expected to be proposed  at at least two of the five sites this year.
     The five sites are: Lemon Lane Landfill, Neal's Landfill, Neal's Dump, 
Bennett's Stone Quarry Dump and the Winston Thomas site. The Lemon 
Lane Landfill and Winston Thomas sites should be addressed in 1996. A 
review of each site's history, new studies and a draft cleanup schedule are 
due Feb. 13.
     The studies are being done in compliance with a state law requiring 
them before an on-site incineration permit can be issued. Westinghouse is 
about mid-way through the collection the data, which will supplement 
earlier RI/FS reports.
     The state hired PRC Environmental Management Co. to study 
solvent extraction, chemical dechlorination, biological remediation, quick 
lime treatment, low temperature thermal desorption, desorption with 
vaporization extraction and plasma torch technology.

North Bronson to get summer ROD

     EPA expects to sign a ROD in June for a soil and groundwater cleanup 
at the North Bronson Industrial Area NPL site in Bronson, Mich., where a 
less stringent cleanup than originally anticipated might be allowed because 
of changes in state cleanup level requirements.
     The state is reevaluating Montgomery Watson's fund-lead FS because 
the studies were conducted before changes in the state law with regard to 
cancer risks. Last summer the state changed its cancer risk level from 10 -6 
to 10 -5.
     A ROD originally was scheduled for last summer. Another factor in the 
delay is that an industrial sewer system, which  connected two wastewater 
lagoons, was not evaluated as part of the RI/FS. Additional investigations 
might be required to further delineate the definition of the site. If more 
investigations are needed, the state likely will use Montgomery Watson of 
Novine, Mich.
     Two former industrial waste lagoon areas constructed by the City of 
Bronson around 1940 need to be cleaned up, along with groundwater 
contaminated by the lagoons and at least one other source area (Superfund 
Week 9/1/95).

A.I.W. Frank g.w. talks delayed

     EPA is expected to begin negotiations this month for the design and 
construction of a portion of a $10.9 million soil and groundwater cleanup at 
the A.I.W. Frank/Mid-County Mustang NPL site in Exton, Pa. The talks 
were delayed by the recent federal furlough.
     Under the ROD signed in September, a groundwater pump-and-
treatment system with air stripping will be needed to treated solvents-
contaminated groundwater. 
     About a half-dozen wells will extract contaminated groundwater from a 
fractured bedrock aquifer. Treatment will continue for about 30 years.
     The only apparent discharge point for treated groundwater is a nearby 
river, but since the river is a trout stream EPA has left flexibility in 
the plan and is evaluating other options.
     Also, about 230 cubic yards of contaminated source soil needs to be 
excavated and disposed off-site. The soil is located at a former waste 
solvent tank storage area.
     A building demolition project and a small drum removal also is 
required.
     The entire cleanup will cost about $10.9 million, most of which (about 
$6 million) will be required for the groundwater cleanup. Design work is 
expected to begin in 1997.

Nature to clean up Chevron g.w.

     EPA proposed natural attenuation and monitoring for pesticide-
contaminated groundwater at the Chevron Chemical Co. site in Orlando, 
Fla., where a ROD should be signed this spring.
     The plan contains a contingency for a barrier wall and air sparging if 
contamination levels do not decrease quickly enough. Samples will be 
taken quarterly to see if levels of xylene and alpha-BHC are dropping by 
10% to 15%.
     If levels do not decrease, a permeable filter wall will be used with 
limited air sparging or a hydraulic containment system. Monitoring is 
expected to last eight to ten years.
     The proposed plan is expected to cost $247,700 if natural attenuation 
works. The contingency will cost about $1.3 million.
     Chevron completed two removal actions to address soil contamination 
at the site. In 1991, the company removed 18,000 tons of pesticide-
contaminated soil at the plant property, and in 1994 230 tons of soil were 
removed from an adjacent trailer park.
     A pesticide formation plant operated at the site between 1950 and 1976. 
The contaminants of concern were chlordane, DDT, parathion and 
petroleum hydrocarbons.

Bids near for $34M Vineland pump-treat

     EPA is expected to solicit bids this spring or summer for the 
construction of a groundwater pump-and-treatment system at the 
Vineland Chemical Co. Inc. NPL site in Vineland, N.J.
     Under the September 1989 ROD, about a dozen wells will be 
needed to extract contaminated groundwater at a rate of about two 
million gallons per day. Metals precipitation will be the primary 
treatment, and treated groundwater will be reinjected back into the 
aquifer as much as possible and/or discharged to a nearby river.  
     The cleanup is estimated at $34 million, including operation and 
maintenance costs.
     Arsenic is the primary contaminant of concern.
     The Army Corps of Engineers' Kansas City Dist. is handling the 
design for EPA and will solicit the construction bids. After a 
contract award, management of the cleanup will be deferred to the 
Corps' Philadelphia Dist. 
     Malcolm Pirnie Inc.'s White Plains, N.Y., office is designing 
the remedy under contract with the Corps. The design now stands at 
about 65% complete. Construction bids are scheduled to go out in 
May or June and will be advertised in the Commerce Business 
Daily, EPA said.

Soil cleanup takes back burner

     The cleanup of about 126,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil 
will be addressed after the groundwater cleanup, which EPA 
decided to make a priority to halt the off-site migration of arsenic.
     The ROD called for the ex-situ soil flushing of about 126,000 
cubic yards of arsenic-contaminated soil. But last spring design 
work for a soil washing cleanup was put on hold at about the 65% 
stage so other potentially more cost-effective technologies could be 
evaluated (Superfund Week 4/7/95).
     EPA treatability studies showed ex-situ soil washing will be 
more effective than soil flushing. Malcolm Pirnie did bench-scale 
column leaching tests on soil flushing and determined that due to 
chemical properties in the soil, flushing will not achieve the 
agency's surface cleanup goal of 20 parts per million (ppm) for 
arsenic in the top two feet of soil. The subsurface cleanup goal is 
120 ppm. 
     Therefore the plan was to excavate the soil and run it through a 
portable soil washing agitator, or hydroclone, to break the weak 
ferrous oxide bond of arsenic on soil particles and have the arsenic 
come off in the rinse water. But this would require much more 
money than the agency expected when the ROD was signed. The 
ROD estimated the soil and groundwater cleanups at $66 million.
     EPA will make a soil cleanup decision after the groundwater is 
addressed.
     The ROD also calls for the soil washing of contaminated river 
sediments. That cleanup also will take place after the groundwater 
is remediated.
     Arsenic salts were stored in open piles and in chicken coops at 
the 20-acre herbicide plant site at 1611 W. Wheat Rd. in 
Cumberland County. Untreated process wastes were discharged into 
lagoons. About 38 miles of watershed was contaminated with 
arsenic. The site made the NPL in September 1984.

Ottati & Goss g.w. bids eyed for summer

     EPA is expected to solicit bids this summer for the construction 
of a groundwater pump-and-treatment system at the Ottati & 
Goss/Great Lakes Container Corp. NPL site in Kingston, N.H., 
pending resolution of the Superfund budget.
     Another issue to be resolved before any bids are solicited is 
whether to pump-and-treat groundwater below a wetlands area at the 
site.
     Arthur D. Little Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., is designing the 
cleanup as EPA's Alternative Remedial Contracts Strategy (ARCS) 
contractor. The 90% design was reached in October 1995 but has 
since been stalled due to the budget and wetlands issues.
     The January 1987 ROD called for the installation of extraction 
wells in the wetlands area, but EPA's hopes a planned source soil 
cleanup will allow for the natural attenuation of groundwater there.
     Additional soil and sediment sampling was completed last 
month, and the agency expects to make a determination on the 
wetlands issue by mid-February. Contaminated wetlands sediments 
also need to be addressed, and EPA indicated it wants to 
synchronize a sediment cleanup with any installation of 
groundwater extraction wells to avoid having to disturb the wetlands 
more than once.
     In any case, wells will be needed in the plant site area. Design 
of the cleanup is scheduled to be completed late this spring. The 
ROD estimates the remedy at between $4 million and $6 million.
     The overburden aquifer is contaminated with volatile organic 
compounds and metals. The plume starts about 30 feet below the 
surface and stretches some 800 feet, flowing west to east. Although 
the plume has migrated off-site, contamination has diluted and the 
migration of contaminants has leveled off.
     After treatment, groundwater will be reinjected into the 
overburden aquifer via recharge trenching. A leach field similar to 
that of a septic system will be used.

Innovative soil technology still needed

     Between 10,000 and 15,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil 
need to be addressed. The ROD originally called for the incineration 
of all contaminated soil and sediment, but the burn was shelved last 
spring due to community opposition (Superfund Week 4/21/95). 
     At about that time EPA indicated it was open to any technology 
that treats PCBs and volatile organics in soil. No technology has 
been selected, however, and the agency said it is still open to 
proposals. Depending on the technology eventually chosen, 
treatability tests might be needed.
     EPA repeatedly has pulled back on incineration plans at 
Superfund sites around the nation, but generally appears willing to 
go with thermal desorption.

Buckeye cap, wetlands talks under way

     EPA has begun preliminary negotiations with PRPs for a cap, 
constructed wetlands and french drain cleanup at the Buckeye 
Reclamation NPL site in St. Clairsville, Ohio, where the PRPs want 
to make some changes to the design.
     Neither EPA or a PRP representative would elaborate on the 
potential changes. 
     Under the $48.6 million August 1991 ROD, a solid waste cap is 
needed to cover a 66-acre waste disposal area. The cap will need to 
have a permeability of no less than 10 -7 centimeters/second and 
will consist of topsoil, a drainage layer, two feet of clay and a 
grading layer. No liner will be needed.
     The wetlands will have curves to slow the flow of water through 
them. Cattails will be planted on a compost carpet and an 
underlying plastic liner to keep contaminated water from seeping 
below ground.
     Environmental Strategies Corp. of Pittsburgh and Baker & 
Associates of Corapolis, Pa., designed the remedy for about 15 
PRPs on the Buckeye Steering Committee. The steering committee 
is headed by Consol Inc., a Pittsburgh-based coal mining company. 
Most of the PRPs were hazardous waste generators, including a 
number of steel makers.
     Volatile organic compounds and heavy metals are the prime 
contaminants of concern.
     The design estimates the cleanup at only about $21 million, but 
EPA said the design did not address some aspects of the cleanup, 
such as groundwater monitoring.
     Construction of the remedy was scheduled to begin this spring or 
summer but EPA indicated the work is not likely to get under way 
this construction season.
     The site was used for the disposal of coal mine spoils. In 1971 
the Ohio Dept. of Health licensed the site as a sanitary landfill. 
Between 1976 and 1979, the site also received industrial wastes 
including sludges and liquids. Industrial and asbestos wastes were 
dumped in the waste disposal area, where high levels of volatiles 
and heavy metals have been detected. The site made the NPL in 
September 1983.

Raymark cap construction subs needed

     Design is under way for a cap, gas collection and non-aqueous 
phase liquid (NAPL) cleanup at the Raymark Industries Inc. NPL 
site in Stratford, Conn., where subcontractors will be needed as 
construction of the remedy nears this spring.
     Foster Wheeler Environmental Corp. is doing the design 
under a Total Environmental Restoration Contract (TERC) with the 
Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps is managing the $60 million 
cleanup for EPA.
     Foster Wheeler will construct the cap under the TERC, but 
subcontractors will be needed to install NAPL extraction wells and 
to provide capping materials and site stabilization.
     The cap will cover 33 acres at a capital cost of about $25 
million. The cover will consist of a one-foot sand layer with 
perforated piping to vent gas, a geosynthetic clay liner, a flexible 
membrane liner, a geonet drainage layer and some select fill. Gas 
will be treated on-site in two treatment buildings. Cap construction 
should be complete by September.
     Bids for six- to eight-inch extraction wells screened at various 
depths likely will be solicited in March. The NAPL will be 
collected in tanks and taken off-site for treatment. The number of 
NAPL extraction wells needed has yet to be determined.
     Also still to be determined is the stabilization technology for the 
landfill. The Corps is considering pilings, surcharging peat and deep 
dynamic compaction and is expected to make a determination by 
the end of this month. Stabilization work could cost up to $5 
million. 
     The cleanup was outlined in a July 1995 ROD.      
     The cleanup of 37 residential properties was completed in 
September, and the wastes were stored on-site. About 100,000 cubic 
yards of contaminated material from the residential cleanup needs 
to be treated to reduce moisture before it is placed under the cap 
(Superfund Week 7/21/95). 
     Foster Wheeler is about one-third done with the demolition of 
buildings at the 15-acre site. That work is scheduled for completion 
in March.
     Raymark Industries Inc. manufactured asbestos-based products at 
the site and used PCB- and heavy metals-laden waste as yard fill 
throughout the town.

American Creosote design underway

     EPA has begun design of a dense non-aqueous phase liquid 
(DNAPL) recovery system at the American Creosote Works 
(Pensacola Pit) NPL site in Pensacola, Fla. 
     The 1994 ROD called for enhanced DNAPL recovery via water 
injection, but preliminary groundwater design studies determined 
direct pumping was the most effective treatment. About 2 million 
gallons of DNAPL need to be addressed. The ROD estimated the 
remedy at $5.8 million.      
     The ROD also called for groundwater treatment via in-situ and 
ex-situ biological treatment, but EPA is expected to amend the 
ROD to allow scrapping biological treatment if the discharged 
groundwater meets alternative concentration limits. Groundwater 
will be surface discharged and monitored.      Bechtel 
Environmental is working on the fund-lead design, which is due 
late this spring. EPA does not yet have funds to do the work.
     For the source control operable unit, EPA is developing an 
amendment to a 1989 ROD, which selected biological treatment for 
100,000 cubic yards of surface soil and sediment.
     Treatability studies indicated biological treatment was not 
effective on PAHs, and EPA likely will propose thermal desorption 
as an alternative. Along with PAHs, the soil and sediment also have 
PCP and dioxin.
     A creosote plant operated at the 18-acre site from 1902 to 1981. 
Process wastewater was discharged into two unlined, on-surface 
impoundments. Under an emergency cleanup in 1983, EPA 
dewatered the two ponds, treated the water with coagulation and 
filtration and discharged treated water to the city sewer system.

Lexington cap to get summer bid

     Design is complete for a landfill cap at the Lexington County Landfill 
Area NPL site in Cayce, S.C., and the county is expected to solicit bids for 
construction of the remedy this summer.
     Lexington County agreed to pay for the cleanup, which is estimated at 
$3.5 million in capital costs. Bids will go out once the county completes its 
fiscal year 1997 (which begins in July) budget.
     The 20- to 30-acre cap will consist of 18 inches of cover material -- six 
inches of shredded tires and 12 inches of soil. Also, one portion of the 
landfill needs to be relocated and some garbage removal services will be 
needed.
     An existing gas recovery system not now in use might be converted to a 
passive methane gas collection system.
     The design was completed by G.N. Richardson of Raleigh, N.C.
     Two groundwater extraction wells have been installed at the site and 
will be used to treat about 25,000 gallons of water per day. Groundwater 
will be shipped to either a publicly owned treatment plant or used for 
irrigation.

EPA to bid Arrowhead soil removal

     CH2M Hill's Milwaukee office is expected to solicit bids next month 
from a pool of 16 pre-qualified contractors for the removal of lead-
contaminated soil at the Arrowhead Refinery NPL site near Duluth, Minn. 
     About 27,000 cubic yards of visually-contaminated soil,  sediment and 
buried refuse will be excavated and taken off-site for disposal.
     EPA had expected to bid out the work last year, but the project was 
stalled because of budget cuts (Superfund Week 8/25/95).
     In November 1995, EPA approved $3 million in fund money to clean up 
the site. Another $2.39 million left over from previous site cleanup work 
will be used for the project. 
     A contract will be awarded in April and the work should be completed 
this summer. The work originally was estimated at between $4 million and 
$8 million.
     The Arrowhead Remedial Action Group has nearly completed the 
cleanup of a sludge lagoon area. Demobilization is scheduled for February 
or March.

NL Industries cap, g.w. design due in spring

     EPA has gone ahead with the design of a capping and 
groundwater containment cleanup at the NL Industries/Taracorp 
NPL site in Granite City, Ill., as PRP negotiations continue.
     Woodward Clyde Consultants is designing the remedy for 
EPA. Design work should be completed this spring.
     The cleanup will include the installation of a series of on-site 
extraction wells to contain metals-contaminated groundwater. 
Groundwater will be treated, if necessary, and discharged to a local 
sewer system. 
     Additional monitoring wells would be installed downgradient 
from the existing wells, where high lead or cadmium levels have 
been found. Additional monitoring wells would be installed in the 
remote fill areas, also.
     The groundwater fix will cost about $3 million and take between 
two and four months to implement.
     EPA also considered installing a slurry wall on the perimeter of 
the main industrial area to prevent off-site groundwater migration, 
but that would cost more than $18 million.
     Groundwater monitoring to detect any off-site migration will also 
be required, along with long-term air monitoring.
     No groundwater contamination had been identified when the 
ROD was signed (Superfund Week 10/21/94). But additional 
sampling in late 1992 confirmed site groundwater to be 
contaminated with lead.
     The 1990 ROD also requires the excavation of a slag pile and 
combining it with the main Taracorp pile. Soil from the main 
industrial area with lead concentrations above 1,000 parts per 
million and any soil containing hard rubber battery casings will be 
excavated and added to the new lined section of the main Taracorp 
pile. 
     The slag will then be covered with a multi-layer cap. A three-
foot layer of compacted clay would be used as a liner for the cap. 
The excavated area will be backfilled and topped with sod or 
asphalt.
     The source removal will cost about $4.8 million and take nine to 
15 months to conduct.
     Under criticism from town residents and officials for proposing to 
dispose of contaminated materials on an existing slag pile near City 
Hall, EPA changed the ROD in 1993 and 1994.
     The agency also considered excavating the slag and sending it 
to an off-site hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal 
facility, but that would have cost more than $64 million. Also 
considered was building a landfill on-site to dispose of the slag, but 
that option would have cost about $29 million.
     Meanwhile, cleanups at remote fill residential areas have nearly 
been completed. Fill containing hard rubber battery casings is being 
excavated and segregated into hazardous and non-hazardous groups. 
Hazardous materials are being stabilized and disposed at an off-site 
landfill. Non-hazardous materials are being taken directly to an off-
site landfill. The excavated areas will be backfilled with soil or 
clean fill and capped. Contaminated fill in driveways or alleys is 
being capped with asphalt. 
     That work will end up costing between $1.3 and $1.4 million.

Escambia Wood resident relocation eyed 

     A second round of RI sampling is set to begin this month at the 
Escambia Wood Treating Co. NPL site in Pensacola, Fla., where 
EPA is considering permanently relocating nearby residents as part 
of an interim action.
     EPA is evaluating relocation options for 300 households with 
contaminated soil. The agency might propose a relocation plan this 
spring. Four areas are being targeted as part of a fast track 
relocation investigation. Permanent relocation of all the residents 
has been estimated at $23 million.
     However, EPA does not have funding for the relocation or any 
additional remedial action, so any cleanup work might be put on 
hold until fiscal year 1997.
     Meanwhile, a site-wide RI/FS, which began in November, is 
continuing to determine the nature and extent of soil and 
groundwater contamination. Thermal treatment and off-site disposal 
options will be considered.

Alternatives to soil burn needed

     Contaminants of concern include PCP, creosote, PAHs, dioxin 
and arsenic. 
     Also, a pile of 250,000 cubic yards of dioxin-contaminated soil, 
which was stockpiled during a removal in the early 1990s, needs to 
be investigated. The stockpile has the worst kind of dioxin (2,3,7,8-
TCDD) at levels as high as 12,000 parts per million. Creosote has 
been detected in the thousands of parts per million range. 
     The soil was excavated to stop leaching to groundwater, but no 
additional action was taken after residents objected to incineration 
of the stockpile in 1992 (Superfund Week 10/2/92). EPA estimated 
the cost of incineration at $40 million in 1994.
     Dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contamination is 
suspected in a quarter-mile plume that runs from the site to the 
downgradient Agrico NPL site.
     The RI/FS should be complete by February 1997. CDM Federal 
Programs Corp. is doing the studies as an EPA Region 4 
Alternative Remedial Contracts Strategy (ARCS) contractor 
(Superfund Week 1/27/95).
     The 26-acre site is located on the north edge of the Pensacola 
city limits and is the target of an environmental  justice initiative 
because a minority neighborhood is on the north side.

Bill would give Corps all fund-lead work

     Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., entered a bill in the House 
last month to give the Army Corps of Engineers contract oversight 
of all fund-financed Superfund cleanups.
     A staffer for Frelinghuysen said the bill has been referred to the 
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which is 
expected to take up the bill shortly after Congress returns on Jan. 22. 
Frelinghuysen is a member of the Appropriations energy and water 
development subcommittee, which has heavy oversight of the 
Corps. He is also a member of the VA-HUD and independent 
agencies subcommittee, under which CERCLA is funded.
     Once EPA selects a remedy at an NPL site, it tasks the Corps to 
manage the cleanup about 35% of the time. Frelinghuysen wants 
that percentage upped to 100%, saying giving the Corps 
management responsibility will "speed cleanups, reduce overhead, 
and provide better management of Superfund cleanups."

Focus is on Corps, EPA strengths

     "My bill would mandate that all contracting oversight of site 
cleanups under the Superfund program be managed by [the Corps]," 
Frelinghuysen said. He added it will "simply let EPA do what it 
does best, which is scientific analysis and site characterization. 
Once a remedy is selected, it then brings in [the Corps] to do what 
they do best, which is to manage large, complex construction 
projects."
     The House freshman, who served 13 years in the state 
legislature, represents New Jersey's 11th district, which has 13 
Superfund sites -- more than any other congressional district in the 
nation.
     H.R. 2801, the Site Clean-up Improvement and Acceleration Act 
of 1995, amends Section 104 of CERCLA.
     The bill says: "Except in the case of remedial actions carried 
out by a state or political subdivision ..., contract administration of 
awarded contracts for design and construction associated with fund-
lead remedial actions commenced ... after the date of enactment ... 
shall be performed by [the Corps.]"
     However, any such changes to the program have to make it 
through the House environment subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction over Superfund. Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, who chairs 
the subcommittee, previously has said he wants to minimize fund-
lead cleanup projects and the Corps' role in Superfund (Superfund 
Week 3/31/95).

EPA proposes Spokane stabilization, cap

     EPA proposed a $1.7 million to $2.3 million soil stabilization 
and capping project as part of a removal action at the Spokane 
Junkyard/Associated Properties NPL site in Spokane, Wash.
     Under the recommended alternative, all soil above residential 
cleanup levels (400 parts per million for lead, 1 ppm for PCBs) will 
be excavated and consolidated on the Spokane Metals property. 
     Soil above 5,000 ppm lead will be treated with chemical 
stabilization. The stabilized soil will be consolidated with soil with 
contamination levels between 400 and 5,000 ppm, which will not be 
treated, and capped with a geomembrane and soil cover.
     The 5,000 ppm standard will require that only about half as 
much material be stabilized as would be using the industrial lead 
level of 1,000 ppm.
     Other options EPA is considering include excavation and off-site 
disposal of all contaminated soil; off-site disposal of soil above 
industrial levels and capping of soil above residential levels; and 
capping of all soil above residential levels. The most expensive 
option, at between $6.8 million and $8.1 million, is off-site disposal 
of all soil above residential cleanup levels.
     Lead is found in surface soil on most of the site and PCBs are 
found sporadically in surface soil. The site has been zoned for 
residential use with the exception of the former Spokane Metals 
property. Between 8,000 and 15,000 cubic yards of contaminated 
soil will need to be addressed.
     EPA will make a decision on cleanup options after the comment 
period closes Feb. 16.
     The PRPs agreed to design the removal but another settlement 
will be needed for construction of the project.
     The PRPs at the site, Kaiser Aluminum, Washington Water 
Power, and Inland Power and Light submitted an EE/CA for the 
removal in December 1995 (Superfund Week 12/8/95). Alta 
Geosciences of Battelle, Wash., did the EE/CA.
     The 16-acre site is located in a light commercial and residential 
area. Asbestos and drums of hazardous wastes were removed and 
taken to an approved hazardous waste facility in 1987.

Wyckoff/Eagle Harbor to get near-shore fill

     EPA has signed a ROD amendment that calls for construction of 
a near-shore fill and solidification of soil and sediments at the 
Wyckoff/Eagle Harbor NPL site in Bainbridge Island, Wash.
     Under the amendment, hot spot sediments will be placed in a 
confined disposal facility (CDF) and capped with clean material 
and asphalt. The one-acre fill will be built adjacent to the former 
shipyard. EPA proposed the change in September (Superfund Week 
9/29/95).
     Under the 1992 ROD, heavy metal hot spot soil and sediments 
were to be disposed in a hazardous waste or municipal landfill. 
     The amendment came largely in response to community 
concerns that a private boatyard would be forced to leave the harbor 
under the original cleanup plan. The fill will create nearly one acre 
of additional land that the Washington State Dept. of 
Transportation  (WSDOT) has committed to lease for private 
water operations. 
     A drainage system will be needed to prevent surface and 
groundwater from leaching into the harbor. 
     Also, a habitat migration plan will be needed. The outer walls of 
the CDF will be enhanced with gravel to provided a favorable 
habitat for barnacles and mussels.
     The primary contaminants at the site are PAHs and mercury.
     Design efforts begun by PRPs PACCAR Inc. and WSDOT will 
resume now that EPA has agreed to the near-shore fill. Hart-
Crowser Inc. is designing the cleanup for the PRPs and has 
submitted the 35% design. A final design should be complete early 
this summer, at which time EPA will begin negotiations with the 
PRPs for construction of the cleanup. In addition to PACCAR and 
WSDOT, the Washington Dept. of Natural Resources and the 
U.S. Dept. of Defense are potentially liable parties. The cleanup 
will cost about $4 million.
     Also at the Wyckoff site, building demolition is expected to be 
completed early in the spring. EPA recently replaced the wells in a 
groundwater pump-and-treatment system that has been operating 
since 1990. The system uses physical separation of oil from the 
water, biological treatment and carbon adsorption to treat about 100 
gallons per minute.
     CH2M Hill is doing an RI/FS at the facility, which should be 
completed sometime this year.  
     The design of an interim groundwater barrier wall to prevent 
water from reaching the harbor, prescribed in a 1994 ROD, is 
awaiting funding in addition to the RI results.

Senate mulls liability deal

     Senate Republicans soon could take up a reauthorization proposal 
freeing PRPs at multi-party sites from the Superfund liability net.
     Sources say GOP staff members have recommended the measure as the 
one for which the most broad-based support could be garnered. The move 
comes light of the disastrous response to other recently proposed liability 
exemptions such as the retroactive liability discount (RLD) and tax credits 
for PRPs. Sources said neither of those provisions are likely to be in a 
reauthorization bill.
   Included in a House proposal issued last fall was a provision for liability 
shielding at municipal landfill NPL sites (Superfund Week 9/29/95), an idea 
that has drawn less fiery criticism and is viewed by many as the best 
compromise. 
     The move reportedly eliminates about 250 sites from the Superfund 
liability scheme.
     However, even if an agreement can be reached on the multi-party 
liability exemption, issues such as clearly defining "multi-party sites" and 
setting a cut-off date for the repeal will remain to be worked out. Sources 
said the Senate plan most likely will include municipal landfills and other 
sites at which there are dozens or hundreds of small contributors and have 
1981 as the cut-off date.
     House leaders are batting around similar liability exemptions 
(Superfund Week 1/5).

N.J. reps: restore CERCLA funding

     All thirteen New Jersey representatives have signed a letter asking 
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Livingston, R-La., to 
include Superfund in a targeted appropriations bill and restore Superfund to 
full 1995 funding.
     Under the continuing resolution, EPA is operating at 75% of its 1995 
budget, a level the letter calls "unacceptable." New Jersey has 114 
Superfund sites, more than any other state.
     The delegation calls for Superfund to be included in targeted 
appropriations bills that will fund selected programs for fiscal 1996 in the 
absence of a budget agreement.
     "The disarray that the Superfund program has been put through in recent 
weeks, as a direct result of the EPA's appropriations not having been 
enacted yet, threatens the program's underlying integrity and credibility," 
the letter stated.
     Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., leading the New Jersey move said: "The 
104th Congress must take prompt action to remedy the situation by 
approving legislation that President Clinton will sign into law that provides 
the EPA with the needed funds."
