<BODY><H1>DOE Proposes New Approach for Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Services</H1>

<HR>

OCRWM is developing an approach for the performance of its waste acceptance, storage, and transportation responsibilities as set forth in the 

<A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/resource/nwpa/nwpa.htm">Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), as amended</A>, and in the Standard Contract.  A presolicitation conference was held on July 9, 1996, to discuss technical and contractual issues related to the potential acquisition of transportation services.  At the presolicitation conference, OCRWM made available a 

draft Statement of Work and a 

draft Concept of Operations for the waste acceptance and transportation services acquisition.  The Department anticipates that a <A HREF="/waste/rfp/rfp-cp.htm">draft request for proposals (RFP)</A> should be issued for public review and comment in December 1996, followed by another presolicitation conference in the February/March time frame.  The draft RFP and the presolicitation conferences are preliminary steps taken to support the release of a final RFP in a timely manner.<P>

<P>

OCRWM is pursuing an acquisition process that is market driven, relying on private industry (contractors) to provide all necessary services and equipment required to fulfill OCRWM's mission at competitive, fixed prices and fixed rates.  The contractors would accept spent fuel from its owners and generators (Purchasers) and supply casks and equipment for transporting spent fuel to (and possibly storage at) a designated Federal facility.  Contractors would work with Purchasers to determine the best way to service a site and would recommend to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission preferred transportation routes to a Federal facility.  <P>

<P>

OCRWM may award up to four contracts, covering four regions of the United States.  The intent is to develop a market infrastructure to foster competition and innovative approaches to waste acceptance and transportation. The phased approach to contract implementation would allow flexibility and would include sequential development of business/servicing plans that would describe each contractor's general approach, how it might acquire casks and equipment, and its approach to transportation operations.</HTML></BODY>
