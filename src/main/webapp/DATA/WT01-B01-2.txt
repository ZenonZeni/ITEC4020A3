<img src="martract.gif" align="left" hspace=10 >The compost process combines the natural organic materials of sawdust with 

sludge, the bi-product of waste water treatment. Over a period of 30 days the 

mixture of organic materials is processed within a special reactor silo. Forced 

air enhances the work of normal bacteria to break down the wood and waste in a 

manner similar to leaves turning to soil on the forest floor. The process, 

completed under the controlled conditions of the reactor, is much faster. Once 

the mixtue is allowed to cure for another 20 days, it is then ready to use as a soil enhancer.

<p>

The sawdust is used with an equal mix of biosolids to make the compost. Sawdust is a bi-product of the lumber industry and, like sludge, was previously disposed of at a land fill. The sawdust, because of its fine texture, breaks down faster than other amendments such as wood chips, that may also be used in the composting process, Sawdust also provides a consistent compost which is very important to many users, especially golf courses, where it is used in the most demanding situations such as on their greens. Compost applied properly will enhance growth of grass, flowers, shrubs, etc. by improving the basic soils.</p>

<p>

Recycling is good for the environment and in many cases good business. Prior to making compost, the City of Geneva spent approximately $160,000 in land fill fees per year to dispose of the waste water treatment sludge. The operation of making compost costs approximately $90,000 per year and the final compost product is sold for nearly half that amount. In short, recycling netted a savings of approximately $110,000 per year over the previous manner of doing business.</BLOCKQUOTE>
