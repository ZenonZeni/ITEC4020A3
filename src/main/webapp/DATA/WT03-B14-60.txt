<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of Lead-Based Paint (LBP) poisoning is the Number 1 environmental cause of illness and death among pre-school children. The federal Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately one in six young children have elevated blood-lead levels associated with such adverse health problems as hemotologic and endocrinologic disorders, decreased intelligence and learning ability and behavioral distrubances.  As concerned parents, teachers, and owners of childcare centers and pre-schools, it is imperative to know if our homes, educational institutions, and recreational facilities pose potential Lead-Based Paint hazards to our children.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrors of Lead-Based Poisoning are common and all too real; the good news is Lead-Based Paint Poisoning IS entirely preventable.  There are two basic assessment techniques recognized by federal and state governments to determine Lead-Based Hazards.  The first is the Lead-Based Paint Risk Assessment which is designed to identify circumstances where children are at risk for Lead-Based Paint Poisoning generally in the forms of Lead contaminated dusts generated from renovations, soils and water.  The second is the Lead Inspection which is design to identify each structural component within the home or other facility which contains Lead-Based Paint.  Though banned in 1978, it is estimated that approximately fifty-seven million homes, excluding public housing contain Lead-Based paint.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentinel is committed to the elimination of childhood Lead poisoning; as a public service, we have designed the following Risk Assessment & Lead Inspections informational surveys.  These surveys are intended to alert parents and owners of facilities frequented by pre-school children of potential Lead-Based Paint dangers.  After completing the surveys, please proceed to the informational section entitled "Lead-Based Paint Poison Prevention" if your survey results indicate LBP risk factors are present.
