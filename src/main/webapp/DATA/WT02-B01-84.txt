<p>Introduction and Explanation </p>

<p><font size="2">We are talking about money, so let's be frank.
This library is free and open to the public without any charge
whatsoever, and it will remain so as long as I am able to manage
it. But it does take more than a fair amount of time, labor, and
money to make it happen. Cash contributions are always
appreciated and are a real help in getting the resources we need
to build the library.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have received small contributions from time
to time but they do not match my own personal out-of-pocket
expenses by any means, and probably never will. While I will
accept contributions from anyone who wishes to give, there is no
reasonable expectation that this effort will ever produce a
profit for me.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I now have more than 50,000 pages of material
to scan, type in, or otherwise add to the library, much of it
sent in by major researchers around the world. For the vast
majority of it, I will have to donate my own time to the cause,
or persuade my wife to do it, taking time away from efforts which
might have earned us a better income. Some of this information is
just as fascinating as the best of the pieces which are already
up there. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You can make a general contribution to the
library as a whole. In this case, we will use the money toward
the projects which we currently feel are the top priority. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You can make a specific contribution to a
particular project. You may select one of the works in progress
on the Specific Contributions page, our you may write in your own
ideas for what you would like to see done with the money. </font></p>

<h3>Where the Contributions Go</h3>

<p><font size="2">Contributions made through this screen are made
to Clifford A. and Yvonne Schaffer as individuals and are <u>not</u>
tax-deductible. There is no formal organization behind this
effort, either profit or non-profit. It is provided and
maintained by individuals only.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">How do you know that we will use the money for
the stated purpose? Well, the best answer is that we have been
doing this for several years without any contributions, and we
will continue to do it regardless of whether you or anyone else
contributes. You must have some faith that we, as individuals,
will use your contribution for the stated purpose. If you don't
have faith in that, based on past performance, don't make a
contribution. </font></p>

<h2>How to Contribute by 900 Number</h2>

<p>You can make a contribution by calling a 900 number and the
contribution will be billed to your phone bill. </p>
