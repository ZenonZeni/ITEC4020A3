<h3>3. Chemical Modifications of LSD </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When a new type of active compound is discovered in
pharmaceutical-chemical research, whether by isolation from a
plant drug or from animal organs, or through synthetic production
as in the case of LSD, then the chemist attempts, through
alterations in its molecular structure, to produce new compounds
with similar, perhaps improved activity, or with other valuable
active properties. We call this process a <i>chemical
modification </i>of this type of active substance. Of the
approximately 20,000 new substances that are produced annually in
the pharmaceutical-chemical research laboratories of the world,
the overwhelming majority are modification products of
proportionally few types of active compounds. The discovery of a
really new type of active substance&#151;new with regard to
chemical structure and pharmacological effect&#151;is a rare
stroke of luck. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after the discovery of the psychic effects of
LSD, two coworkers were assigned to join me in carrying out the
chemical modification of LSD on a broader basis and in further
investigations in the field of ergot alkaloids. The work on the
chemical structure of ergot alkaloids of the peptide type, to
which ergotamine and the alkaloids of the ergotoxine group
belong, continued with Dr. Theodor Petrzilka. Working with Dr.
Franz Troxler, I produced a great number of chemical
modifications of LSD, and we attempted to gain further insights
into the structure of lysergic acid, for which the American
researchers had already proposed a structural formula. In 1949 we
succeeded in correcting this formula and specifying the valid
structure of this common nucleus of all ergot alkaloids,
including of course LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The investigations of the peptide alkaloids of
ergot led to the complete structural formulas of these
substances, which we published in 1951. Their correctness was
confirmed through the total synthesis of ergotamine, which was
realized ten years later in collaboration with two younger
coworkers, Dr. Albert J. Frey and Dr. Hans Ott. Another coworker,
Dr. Paul A. Stadler, was largely responsible for the development
of this synthesis into a process practicable on an industrial
scale. The synthetic production of peptide ergot alkaloids using
lysergic acid obtained from special cultures of the ergot fungus
in tanks has great economic importance. This procedure is used to
produce the starting material for the medicaments Hydergine and
Dihydergot. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now we return to the chemical modifications of LSD.
Many LSD derivatives were produced, since 1945, in collaboration
with' Dr. Troxler, but none proved hallucinogenically more active
than LSD. Indeed, the very closest relatives proved themselves
essentially less active in this respect. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are four different possibilities of spatial
arrangement of atoms in the LSD molecule. They are differentiated
in technical language by the prefix <i>iso- </i>and the letters <i>D</i>
and <i>L</i>. Besides LSD, which is more precisely designated as
D-lysergic acid diethylamide, I have also produced and likewise
tested in self-experiments the three other spatially different
forms, namely D-isolysergic acid diethylamide (iso-LSD),
L-lysergic acid diethylamide (L-LSD), and L-isolysergic acid
diethylamide (L-iso-LSD). The last three forms of LSD showed no
psychic effects up to a dose of 0.5 mg, which corresponds to a
20-fold quantity of a still distinctly active LSD dose. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A substance very closely related to LSD, the
monoethylamide of lysergic acid (LAE-23), in which an ethyl group
is replaced by a hydrogen atom on the diethylamide residue of
LSD, proved to be some ten times less psychoactive than LSD. The
hallucinogenic effect of this substance is also qualitatively
different: it is characterized by a narcotic component. This
narcotic effect is yet more pronounced in lysergic acid amide
(LA-111), in which both ethyl groups of LSD are displaced by
hydrogen atoms. These effects, which I established in comparative
self-experiments with LA-111 and LAE-32, were corroborated by
subsequent clinical investigations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fifteen years later we encountered lysergic acid
amide, which had been produced synthetically for these
investigations, as a naturally occurring active principle of the
Mexican magic drug <i>ololiuqui.</i> In a later chapter I shall
deal more fully with this unexpected discovery. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Certain results of the chemical modification of LSD
proved valuable to medicinal research; LSD derivatives were found
that were only weakly or not at all hallucinogenic, but instead
exhibited other effects of LSD to an increased extent. Such an
effect of LSD is its blocking effect on the neurotransmitter
serotonin (referred to previously in the discussion of the
pharmacological properties of LSD). As serotonin plays a role in
allergic-inflammatory processes and also in the generation of
migraine, a specific serotonin-blocking substance was of great
significance to medicinal research. We therefore searched
systematically for LSD derivatives without hallucinogenic
effects, but with the highest possible activity as serotonin
blockers. The first such active substance was found in bromo-LSD,
which has become known in medicinal-biological research under the
designation BOL-148. In the course of our investigations on
serotonin antagonists, Dr. Troxler produced in the sequel yet
stronger and more specifically active compounds. The most active
entered the medicinal market as a medicament for the treatment of
migraine, under the trademark &quot;Deseril&quot; or, in
English-speaking countries, &quot;Sansert.&quot; </p>
