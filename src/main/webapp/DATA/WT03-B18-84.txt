<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>HOPE&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;MANKIND? YOU&nbsp;DECIDE.</H1>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="monkburn.gif" HEIGHT=300 WIDTH=300></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="http://www.fva.org/1095/monks.html">Venerable Thich
Quang Do</A> on June 11, 1963.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>This Buddhist monk burned himself alive to send a message into
our minds and hearts. The image of a burning monk seared itself onto the
world's conscience and sharpened focus on Vietnam's civil strife. How far
will YOU go for what YOU BELIEVE&nbsp;IN? Obviously you don't have to go
this far. &nbsp;It is just an example of how far some people will go for
what they believe in.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>My belief is this: Even though most of the actions of the world
bring us closer to our certain destruction, the future is not fixed. &nbsp;Meaning
if you went back in time 5 times you would get the same results each time
you went. &nbsp;But if you went into the future 5 times it could be different
each time. This is because man has Free Will and has the opportunity to
change his future. &nbsp;The future is not fixed. A small effort on the
part of each person could change our current heading and start to reverse
the horrid disasters of which most are man made.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>We are currently destroying our planet in the following ways
&amp; more.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>1. Fossil Fuel.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>2. Nuclear Energy.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>3. Deforestation of the Rain Forests.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>4. Pollution of the Air, Soil, Water table, Oceans, Magnettic
spectrums.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>5. Overpopulation.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>6. Manipulation and destruction of the Animal Kingdom's natural
evolution.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>7. Morally: The world is full of HATE &amp; Jealousy.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Why should YOU care? &nbsp;The New World Order or whoever THEY
may be are too powerful for me to stop? Well perhaps you're right, you
miss the destruction of the world and you die young, you'll never have
to come back to this planet to see what happened right! &quot;You only
live Once..&quot; as the saying goes. &nbsp;Let's hope then for YOUR sake
that the saying is true or it may just be YOU who has to come back to earth
to live in a toxic wasteland. What can you do? </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>The religious beliefs of man have been manipulated and mistranslated
through difffernt languages, most of the true meaning has been lost or
covered up in lessons of Fear. The Buddhist's are one of the only religions
who do not condem you for not belonging to their religious beliefs. &nbsp;You
should form your own opinion of God or whatever title you choose to give
the Grand Architect of the Universe. There is tremendous quantities of
truth in this world buried and uncovered, scattered under our noses most
of the time. But unless you look for it you will overlook it and be left
in the dark. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Yes it is difficult to be labled different, to go against the
flow. So either decide now, Go with the flow. &nbsp;Or &quot;OPEN&nbsp;UP&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;MIND&nbsp;AND&nbsp;GO&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;OWN&nbsp;WAY.&quot;
(C) <A HREF="sepul.html">SEPULTURA</A> . You can teach the young to believe
in more than what the textbooks barely teach them, show them some of the
facts you have learned here and give them your opinions. It is a difficult
task but a rewarding one. If one person out of ten expands his mind to
a new level it will have been worth your effort. With knowledge and effort
and communication between like minded people I believe that the fate of
the world is not limited to doom just yet. Thank's for your time. We hope
you have learned a few things. Or at least have opened up to speculation
of things that could actually be!</P></CENTER>

out how far one can go.&quot;</P></CENTER>
