<P><HR>

<B><A name="Q1.">Q1 </A>	Do I need to purchase the collision damage waiver
from the rental car agency?</B>
<P>
A1.	For the best overall protection, Yes.  However, if you have
other-than-collision (often referred to as comprehensive) and collision coverage
on at least one vehicle on your auto policy, then your policy will cover
your rental vehicle as though it were your own.  The deductible(s) on your
policy will apply to the rental car.  Your auto policy will not pay for any
extra charges the rental agency may apply, such as loss of use or administrative
fees.  In addition, there may be a difference of opinion between the rental
agency and your insurance company regarding the value of the rental car in
the event of a total loss.  Concerning any benefit you may gain from charging
the rental car with your "gold" credit card, the charge card only responds
as excess over any other available insurance.  Furthermore, the "gold" card
may not pay for loss of use of the rental car and administrative fees in
the event of a loss to the rental car.  You should always clarify coverage
with your agent and be sure you understand the rental agency's contract.

<B><A name="Q2.">Q2 </A>	Why does the driving record of members of my household
affect my rates if they do not drive my car?</B>
<P>
A2.	Auto policies are heavily regulated by the state you live in and most
situations require insurance to pay no matter who's driving your car.  If
the insurance company only had to pay for losses involving the listed drivers
then they would only be concerned with the driving records of the listed
drivers because all others would not be covered.

<HR>
<B><A name="Q3.">Q3 </A>	Should I buy collision coverage on my ten year old
car?</B>
<P>
A3.	The answer depends on many factors.  Compare how much your car is worth
versus the cost of collision coverage plus your deductible.  You can get
an estimate of how much your car is worth from the "blue book" or N.A.D.A.
which can be found at book stores and libraries.  If you have not transferred
the collision risk to an insurance company by buying collision coverage,
you are assuming the entire risk yourself.  Sometimes the collision coverage
may seem expensive, but it should be purchased if you could not afford to
absorb the total loss of the value of the car.  Remember collision coverage
responds to damage to your car only.  If it is the other party's fault their
policy will pay for damages to your car and there is no deductible.
<HR>
<B><A name="Q4.">Q4 </A>	If I drive someone else's car and wreck it, does
my policy pay for the damage?</B>
<P>
A4.	No.  Insurance follows the car not the driver.  The insurance covering
the car would respond to damages.  Your policy may respond but only as excess
over the primary insurance covering the car.
<HR>
<B><A name="Q5.">Q5 </A>	What can I do to keep my auto premiums down?</B>
<P>
A5.	Make sure you are getting all the discounts allows by your insurance
company such as:  Multi-Car, renewal, claim-free, good student, driver training,
defensive driver course, anti-lock brakes, air bags, anti-theft device, and
multi-policy discounts.  Households with drivers having no tickets or accidents
will be eligible for the best rates.  Ask us how much you can save by increasing
your deductibles.  Sports cars, four-wheel drive vehicles and expensive cars
will increase your premiums.
<HR>
<B><A><A name="Q6.">Q6</A>	How will an alcohol-related ticket (DUI or DWI)
affect my premium?</A></B>
<P>
A6.	If you already have a policy in effect, it is possible that nothing will
happen for some time.  Your current insurance company may not find out that
you have the ticket.  However, sometimes insurance companies randomly check
driving records.  Many companies would non-renew your policy at expiration
in such an instance.  If that were to happen, there are several non-standard,
commonly referred to as high-risk, companies that would take you.  It would
not be unusual for your premium to triple with a non-standard company.  If
you are currently getting your insurance from a preferred company, you should
sit tight and not make any waves.  Pay your bills on time and do not let
it cancel.  Also, do not change companies, as any company writing a new policy
will order your driving record and find out about the ticket.
