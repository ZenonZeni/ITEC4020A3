I am a PhD research student working at the 
<a href = "http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/"> Scott Polar Research 
Institute</a> (SPRI), Cambridge University. 
At University I am jointly supervised by Dr. M. Grae Worster of the 
<a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Applied Mathematics 
and Theoretical Physics</a> (DAMTP) and 
<a href="http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/people/wgr2/home.htm">Dr Gareth 
Rees</a> of SPRI. In addition, I am supervised by Dr. Howard Cattle of 
the <a href="http://www.meto.govt.uk/sec5/sec5pg1.html">Hadley 
Centre</a> for Climate Prediction and Research at the UK Meteoreological Office.

Sea ice is a thin, fragile, dynamic solid that forms under the thermodynamic conditions that prevail near the 
Earth’s poles. Sea ice acts as a barrier to the transfer of moisture, heat and momentum between the oceans 
and the atmosphere and plays an important role in the formation of deep water masses. Throughout the year, 
sea ice cover varies between about a twentieth to a thirtieth of the Earth’s surface but has a disproportionately 
large role in the climate system of the Earth.
<p>
Sea ice research on macroscopic scales is a well established, important and ongoing activity. Dr. Peter 
Wadhams, of SPRI, has pioneered much of this work. My research focuses on smaller scales and the 
fundamental physics involved, in the hope that this will lead to understanding and parameterisation of critical 
phenomena for use in climate models.
<p>
When seawater freezes, salt is expelled from the solid in a concentrated salt solution called brine. My research 
involves the use of analytical mathematical techniques to solve fluid dynamical problems to do with processes 
involving brine drainage and solidification. To date, I have used simple analytical models to investigate the 
qualitative effect that deformations of the sea ice cover have on brine drainage. Up to half of the volume of sea 
ice is in the form of ridges caused by deformation. Ridges are formed by sea ice movements induced by ocean, 
wind, and internal stresses. I have also investigated some models of the stability of the interface between heavy 
brine in sea ice and the less dense underlying ocean. I have investigated the effect of ocean shear on the 
underside of the sea ice on brine drainage within the ice. I am currently investigating the effect ocean shear 
has on the stability of the region of sea ice growth, the mushy layer. This extends previous work done on 
instabilities in mushy layers in the context of the solidification of binary alloys.
<p>
Amongst the most important analytical techniques I have been using are scaling analysis and exact and 
approximate (though still analytical) methods of solving partial differential equations such as similarity 
solutions, eigenfunction expansions, Green’s functions and asymptotic methods. I have been using these 
methods to obtain solutions to problems arising from the application of boundary conditions to systems of 
dynamical equations such as the Navier-Stokes equation and conservation equations for heat and solute.
<p>
The analytical nature of my work means that the solutions to the problems I have been tackling can in principle 
and practice be applied to problems of a seemingly unconnected nature. My latest work, for example, in 
addition to promising insights into how sea ice forms in typical polar conditions also has application to the 
solidification of alloy castings.
