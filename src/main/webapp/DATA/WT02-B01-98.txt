<p>By</p>

<p>Gordon E. Kenney, Ph.D. Licensed Psychologist The University
of Memphis Memphis, Tennessee, USA </p>

<p>The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), home of
the &quot;Drug Czar&quot; (or is it Tsar?), has been charged with
eradicating illicit drug use since 1982. The ONDCP's budget
increased over 600% between 1982 and 1992, and now well exceeds
$13 billion. </p>

<p>The attached graph compares arrests and lifetime substance use
and abuse (including dependence) rates pertaining to alcohol and
illict drugs in the United States in an effort to evaluate the
&quot;impact&quot; the ONDCP has had on illicit drug use and
abuse. The following information concerns 1985 data from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the American Psychiatric
Association, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The
year 1985 was chosen because it is the latest year for which
there are solid national estimates of drug and alcohol abuse. </p>

<p>The data indicate that many more Americans used alcohol than
illicit drugs in 1985. Among alcohol users, about 14% were
abusers (or were otherwise dependent on it), whereas illicit drug
abusers (or dependents) comprised about 17% of illicit drug
users. This illicit drug abuse rate may even be inflated, because
rates cited by the American Psychiatric Association were
aggregated for use in the graph below which did not account for
concurrent abuse of multiple drugs. About 1% of alcohol
users/abusers were arrested for drunkenness or DUI/DWI offenses,
whereas about 0.5% (i.e., one-half of 1%) of illicit drug
users/abusers were arrested for possession of illicit drugs. </p>
