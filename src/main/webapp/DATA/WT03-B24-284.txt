<P>Crooks 'n' Nooks Mystery Books & Collectibles is a small bookstore in historic Sutter Creek, California specializing in mysteries, children's books, and unique gifts and cards. 
Two cozy book-lined rooms,<I> including a real nook</I> are furnished with wingback chairs, reading lamps, and tables. The store stocks new and used mysteries, true crime, spy thrillers and children's books. Other bookcases contain old collectible books and mystery puzzles and games. The antique furniture and lace curtains at the windows add to the charm of this unusual store which resides in a 90-year-old farm house. Though a business (and one of two bookstores in town) - the building still retains the cozy feel of home, especially when rain strikes the tin roof. 

<P>Crooks 'n' Nooks was begun when owners Diane Christensen and Sharon Martin met singing in the church choir. Christensen had always been interested in books (with a particular passion for mysteries), and Martin had always wanted to open a gift shop. They combined their talents and cemented their partnership by attending the American Booksellers Association school for booksellers. Christensen and Martin opened Crooks 'n' Nooks in June, 1993. As both women work full-time, Christensen as a librarian in Sacramento County and Martin for the California Youth Authority, their husbands - both Steves - help tend shop during the week. 

<P>Martin describes Crooks 'n' Nooks inventory as an "eclectic mix." The store carries the range of mystery and detective fiction, "everyone from Tony Hillerman to Dick Francis." However, Crooks 'n' Nooks specializes in female mystery writers such as Marcia Muller, Elizabeth George and P.D. James. "There just happen to be so many wonderful female mystery writers - and Elizabeth George is our favorite," raved the bookseller. 

<P>The store also stocks gifts and collectables, some of them mystery related. Among the more unusual items available at Crooks 'n' Nooks are mystery jigsaw puzzles. Individuals have to complete the puzzle in order to solve the mystery. Another unusual gift item is a party game called "Pasta, Passion and Pistols." Intended to be acted out over dinner,  "the game even includes recipes," notes Martin.

<P>The store also carries fantasy and children's books - especially series such as the wildly popular <B>Goosebumps</B>,as well as the Boxcar Children, Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books. Combining store specialities is a series by the English writer Enid Blyton which are mysteries for children.

<P><IMG SRC="image/nooks.jpg" hspace=10 width=216 height=137 border=1 align=right ALT="storefront">

<P>One of Crooks 'n' Nooks distinguishing features is Bentley, a life-size wooden butler dressed according to season. Bently greets customers with his tray of "Mostly Murder" newsletters. Depending on the weather, Bently may be found on the front porch or inside the shop. And depending on the season, Bently has been known to sport a Halloween cape and mask, Christmas cap or even a springtime garland.

<P>Crooks 'n' Nooks prides itself on "the personal touch." The store provides customers with help in finding books, and it is not unusual for individuals to receive a phone call letting them know a book they might enjoy has arrived. The store hosts occassional author readings and signings. Other special events sponsored by the Crooks 'n' Nooks have included mystery weekends at a local bed & breakfast, and mystery dinners involving a local winery and theater group. Telephone for information on events or directions to the store, which is located just an hour from Sacramento.
