<H3>The Big Picture: A National Summary Of Disturbance </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The continental overview that we have assembled was made up of
two separate pictures.
<P>
For the ILZ, which is 39% of the continent, computer processing
of satellite data compiled a high resolution image of clearing.
<P>
For the ELZ, based on expert interpretation of satellite images,
the remaining 61% of the continent was allocated into three levels
of landcover disturbance resulting from grazing and, to a much
lesser extent, burning.
<P>
In this chapter, these two primary datasets are brought together
to provide a national overview, the big picture. These data are
presented according to a sequence of questions that might flow
from the generic one - what did we find?
