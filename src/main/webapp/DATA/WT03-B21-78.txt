<H3>1)  THE POWER INDEX</H3>

<P>
A very basic fact is that money always goes where it's treated
best!!! As interest rates climb, money starts to leave the stock
market, being pulled, just as a magnet pulls, into higher yielding
bonds and money market funds. And conversely, as interest rates
drop, the attraction of bonds and money market funds diminishes,
and money starts flowing back into the equity markets. This simple
truth cannot be emphasized too much.
<P>

The POWER INDEX is constructed by dividing the current month's
yield of a given short-term Treasury note by the yield of the
same note six months ago. When the current yield rises
above the six months past yield, giving us a reading of more than
1.00, a sell signal is flashed. Conversely, when the current yield
falls below the six months past yield, giving a reading below 1.00,
we get a buy signal.



<H3>2)  THE ADVANCE-DECLINE LINE</H3>

<P>
The Advance-Decline Line is constructed by taking each day's difference
between those stocks that advanced in price and those that declined.
The resulting line, generated by adding these differences every
day, is a far better method of determining the direction of the
market than the popular averages. This indicator typically hits
bottom at roughly the same time as the market and therefore is
of little help in anticipating a change in direction. But at market
tops, it's a different story. This indicator tends to level off
and move sideways several weeks or months in advance of the Dow
Industrial top. As long as the Advance-Decline Line continues
to make new highs every two or three months, the odds are strongly
in your favor. Generally, once the A-D Line fails to reach a new
high within a six-month period, the odds are against you. And
it becomes a time for extra caution. If too, the Dow moves ahead
to new highs but this indicator remains in its recent confines,
it's a danger signal that the Dow Industrials are painting a pretty
picture, but the internal market strength is fading fast. Lower
prices can be expected.
<H3>3)  THE CABOT TREND LINES</H3>

<P>
The Cabot Trend Lines are our unique way of determining the long-term
trend of the stock market. As long as both the Dow Industrials
and the Dow Transports fluctuate above their respective trend
lines, we consider the market to be bullish. If both Dow Averages
are below their trend lines, we are in a bear market. The Cabot
Trend Line for each Dow Average is a composite of two moving averages,
a 20-week and a 39-week moving average. We use only the lower
reading of the two moving averages in any week. The technique
of using two different time-length moving averages produces earlier
buy signals safely when a new bull market is getting under way
(the 20-week average) and it allows plenty of room for severe
corrections in bull markets without false sell signals being given
(the 39-week average). So using the trend principle, we can never
be on the wrong side of the market for very long. And once the
new trend forces us onto the correct side of the market, the probabilities
favor a continuation of the current market trend.
