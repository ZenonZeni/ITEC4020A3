<p><font SIZE=+1>Orinda, CA, October 1, 1996: Rosenberg Institutional Equity
Management has announced that it has expanded shareholder eligibility for
its U. S. Small Capitalization Fund and its Japan Fund to include retail
investors. Rosenberg has advised these funds since their inception in 1989,
but, to date, they have only been available to the institutional clients
of the Rosenberg group of companies. Rosenberg has also announced that
it will act as advisor to a newly formed International Small Capitalization
Fund, which is available to both retail and institutional clients. Furman
Selz LLC, New York, has been named administrator and distributor for the
funds. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The performance objective of each of the three funds is
to achieve a total return (capital appreciation and current income) greater
than that of its respective benchmark: the Russell 2000 Index for the U.S.
Small Capitalization Fund, the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) for the
Japan Fund and the Cazenove Rosenberg Global Smaller Companies Index excluding
U.S. companies (CRIEXUS) for the International Small Capitalization Fund.
The U.S. Small Capitalization Fund invests primarily in equity securities
of small companies based in the U.S., with total market capitalization
similar to the companies included in the Russell 2000 Index. The Japan
Fund invests primarily in common stocks of Japanese companies traded in
Japanese markets. The International Small Capitalization Fund will invest
primarily in equity securities of smaller companies that are traded principally
in securities markets outside the </font></p>

$15 million and $1 billion. The funds will maintain risk factors and industry
exposures similar to their benchmarks. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>For over 25 years, Barr Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg
Institutional Equity Management, has pioneered the application of quantitative
techniques to solving sophisticated investment problems. His research is
the basis for much of the investment technology used by money managers
today. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management, formed in 1985,
currently manages approximately $3.4 billion - including $683 million invested
outside the U.S. - in broadly diversified equity portfolios for pension
funds, endowments and foundations. The firm maintains its headquarters
in Orinda, California and has offices in London, Tokyo and Singapore. </font></p>
