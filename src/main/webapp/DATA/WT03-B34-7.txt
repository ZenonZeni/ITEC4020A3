MARKET DEVELOPMENT

   On other fronts, Southern Company Services was watching waiting, a
spokesperson said last week. In early December, an Alabama Power
spokesperson said that the utility would probably solicit for first quarter
coal supplies. Georgia Power has had bids in hand since mid-November for
all of its plants except Scherer. But last week, the SCS spokesperson said
fuels officials were evaluating the weather, the load and powerplant burns
before taking action for either utility. In addition, a spokesperson for
Mississippi Power said the utility still has not decided on a term coal
supplier for its Watson plant.
   Maple Creek Mining is continuing to make progress in the Pittsburgh
seam, said MCM's president Robert Murray last month. Last year, sales agent
American Coal Sales circulated sheets of specifications developed by former
owner U.S. Steel Mining but Murray said quality has been far better. The
mine has produced metallurgical and steam coals of 1.1-1.2 percent dry
sulfur, 5.5 percent dry ash and 4-5 percent moisture.
   The key to Maple Creek's high quality is it's management's decision to
concentrate on coal in the main bench of the Pittsburgh seam, Murray said.
Costs, too are lower than expected, largely because of the 2,900 feet of
continuous haulage MCM installed in the old mine. Murray said the mine's
productivity will soon improve again as it installs bridge continuous
haulage system for the mines continuous miners.
   ``It's a real complement to our workforce,'' who installed the mine's
longwall and haulage systems, cleaned up the mine and got into production
in 73 days, Murray said.
   While Murray has said that the target for Maple Creek's coal is the more
lucrative metallurgical market rather than the utlity market and the mine's
base contract is with USX Corp., the coal has appeared on the steam coal
market including a test cokntract with PSI Energy.

SAN ANTONIO SIGNS TERM DEAL; KENNECOTT WRAPS UP ALL PRB SUPPLIES

   The San Antonio City Public Service Board has signed a five-year,
roughly 2.6 million t/y coal supply agreement with Kennecott Energy to
cover the balance of the utility's 5 million t/y burn not covered under a
separate, pre-existing contract Kennecott inherited in its purchase of the
Cordero mine from Sun Coal.
   Although declining to discuss coal pricing beyond that which was
available at the formal bid opening (10-16-95 Coal Week), an official said
that the award was made as per the bid, which would mean that the Cordero
coal is priced at $3.45/t FOB the mine. The new contract does not include
price reopeners. Deliveries begin this month and continue through 2000.
   While the Cordero contracts seem to close the door to spot coal ventures
by San Antonio, there are provisions giving the utility some flexibility in
the event of delivery -- or other -- problems. Additionally, San Antonio
plans to continue its alternative coal testing program, which included the
delivery in December of 45,000 tons of coal from the Kennecott-managed
Colowyo mine in Colorado. The test coal resulted from a ``special
arrangement'' and was not a purchase off of the October bids, he said.
   Delivery of the Cordero coal is by Union Pacific.

BROWN STEPS DOWN AS CONSOL CEO; KARIS TAKES ON GENERAL OPERATIONS

   Twilight fell on an era in the U.S. coal industry Jan. 1 when B.R. Brown
stepped down as chief executive officer of CONSOL Inc. in favor of 
William G. Karis, CONSOL's president. Brown remains CONSOL's chairman,
focusing on ``selected strategic issues.''
   A year earlier, Karis moved up from a position as executive vice
president - administration to president. Karis has been gradually adding
functions over the past several years and by January 1995, he supervised
most functions except for marketing and planning, which Brown retained. As
CEO, Karis will be responsible for the general management of CONSOL Inc.
and its subsidiaries in the CONSOL Coal Group.
   Brown had been CONSOL's CEO since 1982. He presided over four contract
negotiations with the United Mine Workers of America, a number of major
acquisitions including Island Creek Coal Corp. and the installation of
high-productivity longwall mines.
   Brown's tenure also saw DuPont sell a 50 percent interest in CONSOL to
Rheinbraun A.G. of Germany. DuPont considers CONSOL to be a non-core
business and officials have said in the past that DuPont would entertain
offers for its remaining interest.
   CONSOL declined to elaborate on either Brown's or Karis' duties and said
neither man was available for interview.
   With Karis moving up, CONSOL Inc. announced Dec. 20 that it had named
Michael F. Nemser senior vice president-administration, over financial and
general administrative activities at the CONSOL companies. Nemser will be
effectively replaced by Karen L. Musial as vice president and treasurer of
CONSOL Inc.

TAX CREDITS PUT FIRE UNDER BRIQUETTES; COVOL TARGETS UTILITIES, STEEL
MILLS

   Armed with a favorable ruling by the Internal Revenue Service, COVOL
Technologies Inc. announced Dec. 19 that it had formed a partnership to
build a coal briquetting plant in Utah, designed to produce 250,000-1
million t/y of reprocessed coal fines.
   Spokesperson Alan Ayres said the partnership, Utah Synfuel #1, would be
the first of up to 20 such ventures scattered around the U.S. They will use
COVOL Technologies' patented briquetting system which features a special
binder that forms a chemical bond with coal particles, he said. Because the
binder bonds chemically with coal fines and changes their structure, the
COVOL's briquettes qualify as a synthetic fuel.
   Separately, COVOL has two projects to use its briquetting process to
combine iron-bearing mill wastes, and limestone with coal fines or coke
breeze -- coke fines not generally usable in steel making -- to produce a
feed stock for electric arc furnaces. One project is with Gulf States Steel
to recycle coke breeze and mill wastes. The other is located at Vineyard
UT.
   In September the IRS issued a letter ruling that, as a synfuel producer,
COVOL is eligible for Alternative Energy Production tax credits under
section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, briquettes produced
by Utah Synfuel #1 ``investors in the partnership will receive
approximately $25 of tax credits for every ton of coal briquettes produced
by the partnership,'' COVOL announced. COVOL has not yet decided on a site
for Utah Synfuels #1, Ayres said.
   However, in November, COVOL agreed to buy the Wellington Loadout in
Carbon County UT from Nevada Electric Investment Co. Wellington also was a
the site of a wash plant and COVOL announced at the time that the area
contained at least 5 million tons of coal fines which it planned to convert
to briquettes. Ayres said coal fines at the site are low in sulfur content
and would lend themselves easily to most utility uses.
   Utilities have shown themselves resistant to synthetic fuels outside of
the testing phase, but COVOL plans to market its all-coal briquettes
anyway. The firm may have found a better market for its briquetting process
in the steel industry, Ayres said.
   COVOL found that steel mills produce a large volume of waste materials
that now must be stockpiled or disposed of in landfills. COVOL developed
the idea of briquetting iron oxide materials to produce a material that can
be melted in an electric arc furnace with traditional ferric scrap.
Briquettes of coal fines or coke breeze mixed with limestone and iron
wastes can be used as a direct charge in blast furnaces, reducing the need
for coke, he said.
   COVOL first built a miniature electric arc furnace at its Price UT
research facility to prove out their iron-rich briquettes. Ayres said COVOL
iron-rich briquettes were the principle material in a commercial-scale melt
at a mill in the southeast. COVOL and Geneva Steel have built a briquetting
plant at Vineyard UT to produce the coal-iron briquette. COVOL also is
considering a commercial electric arc furnace mini-mill in Utah. COVOL and
a steel mill which has requested anonymity have agreed to build a coke
breeze briquetting plant at a southeastern mill. Gulf States Steel and
COVOL have a letter of intent for a briquetted iron reduction facility in
Alabama.

CURRENT STEAM COAL MARKER PRICES

Coal Week's contract and spot market price listings follow ``marker''
specifications determined on a combination of acknowledged transactions and
confidential state-of-trade discussions with buyers, sellers and coal
traders. These prices reflect only coals bought and sold for the purpose of
generating electricity. Metallurgical and industrial steam coals are
reflected elsewhere in Coal Week. Prices are updated as warranted and
exclude distress transactions. Some specifications may be changed
periodically.

Price ranges reflect differences in current conditions for similar coals
caused by quantity, term or transportation arrangements. Spot prices cover
transactions of 12 months or less. Contract prices reflect current quotes
for contracts of one year or more and include renegotiated prices based on
market price reopeners. Prices are listed in US dollars per short ton FOB
mine site, ``in the car'' or ``in the barge.'' Prices include severance,
Black Lung and other applicable taxes. Producing districts are as defined
in the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937.

Users of this table are reminded that coal prices vary for quality,
transportation and business considerations. Deviations from a marker coal's
specs for heat value, sulfur, ash and chemical content should be considered
when making comparisons to coals of personal interest.

Escalations. Here are some indices used in coal contract escalation
clauses. Other escalators may be used.
Producer Price Index. All commodities (1982 = 100) 6/95-125.3, 7/95-125.3,
8/95-125.0
PPI, Mining Equipment: 6/95-139.1, 7/95-139.1, 8/95-139.1.
PPI, All Coal Rail Transportation: (12/1984 = 100) 6/95-107.6, 7/95-107.0,
8/95-107.1.
PPI, Bituminous Coal Rail Transportation: (12/1984 = 100) 6/95-107.7,
7/95-107.1, 8/95-107.1.
PPI, Diesel Fuel: 6/95-58.9, 7/95-54.2, 8/95-56.0.
Labor (UMWA National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement): General wage
increases -- 12/15/95-$0.40.

PENALTY PROVISIONS
Sulfur penalties range from 25 cents - $1.00/t for each 0.1% deviation from
guarantee. Some contracts use SO2 allowances or EPA penalties to compute
penalties or downward adjustments.
Ash penalty provisions are quite prevalent with 30 cents/t or more for
each full 1% deviation over guarantee are not unheard of.
Contract penalty/premium provisions for Btu/lb. deviations generally are
based as shown below:
1) Deviation in Btu/lb. x FOB contract price per BTU/lb. = adjusted price.
2) As received Btu/lb./guaranteed Btu/lb. x contract price = adjusted
price.

MARKET PERSPECTIVE

   Activity in the coal markets at year's end was mainly the wrapping up of
1995. There were simply no solicitations to report east or west of the
Mississippi. Most purchases reported last week had been in the works for
some time and surprised few people. Prices were reported flat to weakening
despite what most observers believes is pretty good production discipline
in Appalachia.
   If December was slow, sources expect January to be slow as well, despite
cold weather that dipped down to south Florida. ``A lot of people are
trying to push inventories down,'' one sales executive said in
mid-December. While temperatures were cold through most of the East, there
has been no severe cold snap that would push burns way up. And, without
some sort of significant development, prices will not move much one way or
the other.
   By the same token, small stockpiles carry the threat of price
volatility. During the severe winter of 1994, utilities found that they had
to move quickly to keep their inventories in the safety range and prices
soared.
   Sources agreed that A.T. Massey has made major inroads into the market
for quality high-volatile metallurgical coal. The steel mills are being
squeezed between flat prices for their products and higher costs for
low-vol coals. Massey, which has improved its productivity and cut costs,
has been selling its high-quality met coals at $30-$30.50/t to meet the
mills' demands, the sources said.
   One development that could affect the eastern markets is the decision of
Italy's Enel electric utility to pick up options on more than 900,000 tons
of coal for delivery in early 1996 (see item below.) With plans to buy
another 2.7 million tons this year, Enel could have an effect on the
overall steam coal market.

TU ELECTRIC

   TU Electric will rely on three Powder River Basin producers to supply
its Monticello power plant in 1996 with some 500,000 tons of subbituminous
coal as a supplement to Texas lignite. Competing offers out of the San Juan
Basin had been called for (10-16-95 Coal Week) and at least one coal was
tested (10-23-95 Coal Week) at the three-unit station, located near Mt.
Pleasant in northeast Texas. Rail transportation contracts were still under
negotiation last week.
   The half-million tons will be purchased by TU Electric on a spot basis,
with the coal to be supplied from Kennecott Energy's Cordero mine, from
ARCO Coal's Black Thunder mine, and out of Cyprus Amax Minerals' Belle Ayr
mine. The Monticello plant uses about 11 million tons of fuel annually.

KENTUCKY UTILITIES

   As of late last week, Kentucky Utilities had not signed contracts aimed
at supplying its Ghent station with a million tons of coal annually over
the next three years; however, an official said the contracts have been
approved. Once the contracts are signed, Knott-Floyd Land will supply Ghent
with 300,000 t/y of coal from the Mott's Branch job in Knott County KY,
Ashland Coal will supply 400,000 t/y from its Dal-Tex operation, and Cyprus
Amax will supply 300,000 t/y of Kanawha County WV coal produced by
Cannelton Industries, the official said.

SOUTHERN ILLINOIS POWER COOPERATIVE

   Southern Illinois Power Cooperative has signed a two-year coal supply
contract with Jader Fuel and may sign a two-year agreement with Arch Coal
Sales, contracts which together could supply the utility with 500,000 tons
of truck-delivered coal in total.
   Jader already supplies the utility under an existing contract which
expires in May, 1996. The new two-year agreement will then kick in, with
Jader to supply 100,000 t/y out of its mine near Harrisburg IL.
   A 150,000 t/y agreement with Arch depends on successful test burns. The
coal is to be supplied out of the Captain mine.

PUBLIC SERVICE NEW HAMPSHIRE

   Public Service New Hampshire has split awards under Northeast Utilities'
November solicitation for the Schiller station evenly between domestic and
foreign suppliers, according to an NU official, who said last week that the
coal will be supplied out of Colombia South America and ``probably West
Virginia.'' Each unnamed source will be called on to supply ``at least
100,000 tons, plus or minus 20 percent each,'' he said. As reported
previously (11-20-95 Coal Week), NU expects to return to the spot market,
probably in the second quarter of 1996.

ORLANDO FL UTILITIES COMMISSION

   Based on a solicitation issued to its list of domestic suppliers by FAX
on Dec. 12, the Orlando FL Utilities Commission announced the purchase of
four unit train-loads of coal on the spot market from Blue Diamond Coal,
according to OUC spokesman Sheridan Becht. All of the coal is for burning
at OUC's 460 Mw Stanton No. 1 generating unit. Sealed bids from the
solicitation, which sought up to six unit train loads, or about 57,000
tons, were due Dec. 21. OUC received a total of 17 bids.
   Two train loads of coal will be delivered each month in January and
February 1996, on rail lines owned by CSX Transportation.
   The specs on the Blue Diamond coal, which will come from its Leatherwood
mine in eastern Kentucky, were 12,600 minimum Btu/lb., a maximum ash
content of 8.5 percent, 40 percent maximum fines, 8 percent maximum
moisture, and a maximum sulfur content of 1.3 percent.

NEW ENGLAND ELECTRIC POWER

   New England Electric Power has renegotiated coal supply contracts with
Mingo Logan Coal Co. and A.T. Massey Coal Co. and is very close to signing
final agreements on a 1-3 year, 200,000 t/y deal with Crown Coal & Coke.
Both the Mingo Logan and Massey renegotiations were for possible tonnages
of 160,000-400,000 t/y.
   The Mingo Logan renegotiation covers 18 months, while the Massey
renegotiation is for a two-year period. Massey will supply the coal from
its Sidney and Sprouse Creek operations.
   The Crown Coal & Coke deal resulted from offers received in early fall
(9-4-95 Coal Week) on 180,000-720,000 tons of coal for delivery in 1996.
The coal will originate on a Norfolk Southern rail line and be delivered
initially to Lamberts Point.
   The coal will be delivered aboard International Shipholding's Energy
Enterprise, formerly owned by Keystone Shipping under the name, Energy
Independence. It recently was sold to NEPCO and resold the same day to
International. The Energy Enterprise, no longer dedicated solely to NEPCO
needs, has been drydocked for routine maintenance and epairs.

ENEL, THE ITALIAN ELECTRIC UTILITY

   Enel, the Italian electric utility, has declared options on 850,000
metric tons (934,700 st) of coal from seven U.S. suppliers and is preparing
a solicitation for up to 2.5 million mt more for delivery in 1996. This is
in addition to 500,000 mt that Peabody and Drummond are each scheduled to
ship to Enel during 1996 under their long-term contracts.
   Enel is unusual for an international customer in that it holds
transportation contracts with U.S. railroads, primarily the Norfolk
Southern. Although it effectively buys coal at the mine, Enel evaluates it
on a loaded basis in ocean-going vessels. Enel also buys premium U.S. coal
of at least 12,500 Btu/lb. and pays well for the quality. The utility's
1995 ``spot'' contracts were for $41-$41.50/mt..
   Enel has exercised options with AMCI Coal Export for 170,000 mt at a
price of $41.05; with CONSOL on 70,000 mt at $41.25/mt; with Peabody on
170,000 mt at $41.35; with Franklin Coal Sales on 120,000 mt at $41.40/mt;
with A.T. Massey for 120,000 mt at $41.45/mt; with MAPCO Coal for 170,000
mt at $41.50/mt, and with Pittston for 30,000 mt at $41.55/mt. Enel's
original tender called for a combined base tonnage of 2.5 million mt.

CHILE'S COMERCIAL CATUMUTUN S.A.

   Chile's Comercial Catumutun S.A., which buys coal for Chilean industrial
and utility accounts, has arranged to buy two cargoes of test coals from
U.S. shippers, CCSA director Frederick J. Murrell said at year's end.
Murrell declined to name the suppliers, but he said one will ship a
handymax cargo of about 40,000 mt from a U.S. West Coast port and the other
will ship a 30,000-mt cargo from ``another U.S. port.''
   In June, CCSA tendered for four 35,000-mt cargoes to be delivered to the
firm's port at Las Ventanas beginning in November 1995 (CWI 6-26-95).
CCSA's tender specifications were 6,700 kcal/kg or 12,060 Btu/lb. GAR, 35
percent volatiles, 1 percent sulfur preferred (2 percent maximum), 14
percent ash and 12 percent moisture. CCSA's total 1995 sales will be about
600,000 mt of imported and domestic coal. In 1996, the firm said it expects
total sales of about 900,000 mt.

TMT COAL

   TMT Coal, the joint venture of Transmar Coal and Tomen America, will
supply Savannah Electric & Power with about 36,000 mt of South American
coal to test the new coal unloading pier at the utility's Kraft power
plant. A spokesperson for Southern Company Services Inc., which acts as
SE&P's coal supplier, confirmed the purchase last week.
   SCS tendered Oct. 11 for 30,000 mt of coal to test the new unloading
facility under construction at MP 20 on the Savannah River (10-24-95 Coal
Week). The plant has no unloading facilities, so the tender specified that
the coal be delivered by a belt self-unloader. The SCS spokesman confirmed
that the coal will have specifications of 12,300 Btu/lb., 1.1 percent
sulfur and 6 percent ash and will be loaded at the port of Palmerejo. The
coal will be a blend of Colombian and Venezuelan coals.

DOE SPONSORED CLEAN COAL PROGRAM FOR STEEL INDUSTRY MOVES TO TEST STAGE

   The U.S. Department of Energy's partial support of an innovative
technology that could sharply reduce future air pollutant emissions from
the nation's iron-making industry recently moved into full test operations,
approximately five years after DOE initially approved the project.
   The project is the 25th to begin operations in the DOE's Clean Coal
Technology Program, a joint government-industry program designed to
demonstrate environmentally clean ways to use the nation's coal reserves.
The 32-month testing program will be carried out at the Bethlehem Steel
Corp. Burns Harbor plant in Chesterton IN. Commissioning and start-up
testing was completed last November.
   The project involves retrofitting existing iron-making blast furnaces
with a technology that injects crushed coal directly into the furnace.
Conventional iron-making requires that coal first be converted into coke, a
process that can release significant emissions of airborne toxic impurities
along with nitrogen and sulfur based pollutants.
   Because the ``granulated coal injection system'' can replace up to 40
percent of the coke required in a blast furnace, it has the potential for
significantly lowering air emissions while enhancing blast furnace
production, according to a DOE description.
   To prepare for the test operations, Bethlehem Steel retrofitted two high
capacity blast furnaces at Burns Harbor with the new technology. Each unit
can produce 7,000 net tons per day of hot metal. Currently the plant is
processing more than 225 pounds of coal per each net ton of hot metal, an
amount which could be increased to as much as 400 pounds per ton during the
test program.
   Bituminous coals from West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kentucky
will be tested along with possibly a subbituminous coal from the western
U.S. The direct coal injection process allows the use of a wide range of
relatively inexpensive coals, in contrast with coke, which can be made only
from certain high-quality coals.
   Sulfur from the coal is removed by the limestone flux added to the blast
furnace, and is retained by the slag, which is a marketable by-product. In
addition to replacing the coke, the new technology can also improve
performance of the blast furnace. In conventional blast furnaces, natural
gas or oil is used as a fuel supplement. Because coal contains less
hydrogen than either gas or oil, it does not cause as severe a reduction in
temperatures in critically important zones inside the blast furnace. The
higher, more stable temperatures in the furnace improves the efficiency of
the iron-making process, noted DOE.

DOE agreement calls for technology sharing
   If successful, the granulated coal injection system can be applied to
essentially all U.S. blast furnaces. The technology should be applicable to
any type of coal commercially available in the United States with the
exception of various high moisture coals.
   As part of the agreement with the DOE's Morgantown WV Energy Technology
Center, which oversees the project for the federal government, Bethlehem
Steel will share the results of the project with other steel companies. The
Clean Coal program requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a
project be shared by the private sector, with the Energy Department
contributing the remainder. In this project, Bethlehem Steel is providing
more than 80 percent of the total cost of $191.7-million, with DOE
providing about $30-million.
   The project was first approved by DOE in December 1989. Design of the
retrofit technology was started in November 1990 when a cooperative
agreement was signed. Construction began in September 1993.

BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT

   The U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management has extended
until the year 2000 the designation of a nine country area in Oklahoma for
a Category-5 rating for federal coal royalty rate purposes. The region was
granted such a federal royalty rate reduction status in 1990, and BLM has
determined that the coal market in the region is essentially unchanged. As
a result, holders of federal coal leases in the region will pay reduced
federal royalty rates of two percent for underground coal and four percent
for surface mined coal. The notice was published in the Federal Register of
Dec. 4, 1995.

WEPCO NEAR SUPPLY DEALS WITH KENNECOTT, PEABODY, CONSOL, WRI

   Wisconsin Electric Power Co. is close to contracts on subbituminous and
bituminous coal supplies for its Oak Creek power plant.
   Meanwhile, for its Presque Isle plant, the utility has worked up a 1996,
300,000-ton supply contract with Peabody Western for coal from the Big Sky
mine in Montana. WEPCO also revised its contract with Westmoreland
Resources for coal from the Absaloka mine to run through 1997 at 300,000
t/y, said a utility official.
   The not-yet-finalized Oak Creek contracts include a likely 4-year,
600,000 t/y agreement with Kennecott Energy from the Antelope mine in the
Powder River Basin, which could increase to roughly 1 million t/y if WEPCO
is successful in burning a 50-50 blend of subbituminous and bituminous coal
at the plant.
   For bituminous supplies at Oak Creek, WEPCO and CONSOL are working
toward finalizing a one-year, 500,000-ton minimum agreement, under which
CONSOL would supply Pittsburgh No. 8 seam coal from the Bailey-Enlow Fork
complex, the official said. The still-pending agreement would supply all of
the utility's Oak Creek bituminous coal needs which exceed the 800,000 t/y
supplied by Pittsburg & Midway from its York Canyon complex.

BALTIMORE GAS SIGNS 7 CONTRACTS; DEALS COVER 4.5 MILLION TONS OVER 2 YEARS

   Baltimore Gas & Electric has signed seven coal supply contracts which
will supply its three coal-fired stations with 4.5 million tons of coal
over the next two years. Eight coal companies will furnish the coal from
eight mines under a series of two-year agreements.
   For its Brandon Shores plant, BG&E signed a 300,000 t/y contract with
Ashland Coal, which will fill the order with coal from its Hobet 21 and
Dal-Tex operations. Also for Brandon Shores, a partnership involving PBS
Coals Inc. and Southeast Fuels Inc. will supply 400,000 t/y from the Holden
22 mine.
   The Wagner station will receive 300,000 t/y of coal from the Juliana
mine under a contract with Anker Energy, while Coastal Coal Sales Inc. will
supply 200,000 t/y from the Brooks Run mine.
   The utility's Crane station will receive 300,000 t/y from the Sentinel
mine under a contract signed with a partnership involving Anker Energy
Corp. and Courtney Foos. Peabody COALSALES will supply Crane with 200,000
t/y under a contract to be filled from the Federal No. 2 mine, and CONSOL
will supply the station with 150,000 t/y from its Blacksville operation.

LANSING, GM INK 10-YEAR STEAM PACT; DEAL WILL BOOST MUNIS COAL BURNS

   The Lansing (MI) Board of Water & Light and General Motors have agreed
to a 10-year deal which will provide steam to three GM auto plants, in
addition to one already serviced by the utility. A two-mile, 20-inch steam
main, paid for by GM, should be completed by November 1996, connecting
Lansing's Eckert and Moores Park plants to the auto maker's steam
distribution system.
   Earlier (10-23-95 Coal Week), an official estimated that the Lansing/GM
arrangement then under study would increase the coal burn by some 70
percent at Moores Park, going from 50,000 t/y to 85,000 t/y. Lansing's
Moores Park coal contract with Costain Coal for coal from the Ramsey mine
runs through 1996.
   Lansing has been supplying steam to GM's Plant No. 1, near downtown
Lansing. The new deal will provide steam for heating and manufacturing
processes at GM's nearby body and fabrications plants, as well as the
Crafte Centre. Lansing's steam sales will be returned to levels not
required since the late 1960s, before the loss of downtown buildings,
before the construction of more energy efficient buildings, and before
recessions of the 1970s and the introduction of more efficient power
production technologies.
   For the first five years into the arrangement, GM will be paying less
than the rate it now pays for steam; after that, GM's payment for steam
will be structured from published indices.

EFC BUYS 90,000 TONS FOR JANUARY; DIAMOND MAY, CONSOL, RIVERWOOD WILL SHIP

   Electric Fuels Corp., which acts as the fuel-buying agent for Florida
Power Corp., announced the purchase of 90,000 tons of coal from three
vendors in four transactions on the spot market for delivery in January
under its monthly inventory true-up program.
   Transportation will be either direct to Crystal River by rail on lines
owned by CSX Transportation, or by river barge. Barge coal moves through
the river system down the Mississippi to EFC's International Marine
Terminals south of New Orleans, where it is transloaded on to oceangoing
vessels for the trip to Crystal River.
   Diamond May Coal Co. will provide 27,000 tons for Crystal River units
Nos. 1-2, which will be transported by rail from Yellow Creek. The specs
were 12,100 Btu/lb., 11 percent ash, a sulfur content of 0.9-1.2 percent,
and 8 percent moisture. Diamond May Coal Co. also will provide 30,000 tons
for Crystal River units Nos. 4-5, which will be transported by barge from
KMRD Dock on the Big Sandy River. The specs were 12,500 Btu/lb., 11 percent
ash, a sulfur content of 0.75 percent, and 8 percent.
   CONSOL Inc. received a contract for 27,000 tons of coal for Crystal

PACIFICORP IN TALKS WITH BIG RIVERS; WOULD OPERATE PLANTS FOR 25 YEARS

   PacifiCorp would assume responsibility for coal buying, power plant
operation and surplus power marketing for Big Rivers Electric Corp. under a
25-year contract it is negotiating with the co-op. Big Rivers confirmed
last week it is negotiating with PacifiCorp in an attempt to resolve
longstanding financial difficulties. The co-op is about $1.2 billion in
debt. The two companies said they hope to sign a letter of intent within
two to three weeks.
   Unlike several other offers for ``business arrangements'' received and
ultimately rejected by Big Rivers, PacifiCorp is proposing only a
management agreement. Big Rivers would remain locally owned and its
headquarters would stay in Henderson.
   PacifiCorp would take over Big Rivers' coal-buying activities. ``One of
the contingencies we have is we're either going to renegotiate or find new
coal contracts for those power plants'' so their fuel costs can become more
competitive,'' said PacifiCorp spokesperson Dave Kvamme. Big Rivers owns
D.B. Wilson, Green and Coleman plants and operates the Station Two plant
for the city of Henderson KY.
   Big Rivers' past coal-buying practices have been criticized by its major
customers, the Kentucky Public Service Commission and others. Thus far,
three individuals and a major coal supplier have been convicted in
connection with a bribery/kickback scheme to win lucrative coal contracts
from the co-op.

CONSOL BUYS RESERVES FROM PP&L; GREENE HILL BLOCKS UP AGAINST BAILEY

   Two CONSOL subsidiaries have acquired Greene Hill Coal Co., comprised of
about 31,000 acres of Pittsburgh seam coal and 4,000 acres of surface
property near Waynesburg PA from PP&L Resources for about $52 million.
   PP&L Resources, the parent of Pennsylvania Power & Light, has owned the
property since 1974. Earlier this year it decided that it would not use the
coal to generate its own power and asked for bids from interested parties,
a spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to comment on any
connection, but Pennsylvania state regulators have forced PP&L to divest
itself of its Pennsylvania Mines division.
   Industry sources said the Greene Hill reserves abut CONSOL's Bailey mine
reserves.

BIG RIVERS SEEKS TO CANCEL PACT; SAYS GREEN RIVER WON DEAL BY FRAUD

   Big Rivers Electric Corp. is redoubling efforts to cancel a
controversial long-term contract with Green River Coal Co. following the
recent conviction of Green River and its majority owner, Clyde Brown Jr.,
on charges they procured the high-priced agreement through fraud (12-18-95 
Coal Week).
   In late December, Big Rivers filed motions in U.S. District Court and
U.S. Bankruptcy Court to set aside the 1984 contract which runs through
2004. Green River, undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization, supplies about 1
million t/y of high-sulfur coal. The utility buys the coal for $31/t. Green
River, purchases the coal from Andalex Resources for $22/t.
   Big Rivers asserted that Green River ``is not an innocent party; it is a
convicted criminal ... equity should not permit Green River Coal to
continue to profit from a contract which a jury has determined was procured
by fraud and commercial bribery.''
   Big Rivers officials say the spot market price for comparable coal is
$18.41/t. Green River is paid about $780,000 per month in excess of the
Andalex price and nearly $1.1 million a month in excess of the spot market
price, according to the utility.
   Green River and Brown were found guilty of paying more than $200,000 in
bribes and kickbacks to former Big Rivers general manager William Thorpe to
win the lucrative contract. Thorpe, who faces similar charges, is expected
to stand trial next summer.
   Green River and Brown are expected to appeal their recent convictions.
They also are expected to oppose the latest Big Rivers' motions.
