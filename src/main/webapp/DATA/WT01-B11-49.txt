<H1> Graupner/OS Model Engine </H1>

<H2> 5 cc </H2>

<P> This engine was designed by Graupner in West Germany and
manufactured by OS in Japan.  As far as I know, it has been manufactured
continuously since 1971 or earlier, though it was some time later that
they could be imported into the US because a license needed to be
negotiated with Curtiss-Wright.

<P> Clarence Lee wrote in RC Modeler magazine at that time "to say I was
very surprised and impressed with the performance of the engine would be
an understatement. ...this one really hauls!" (RC Modeler Magazine).

<P> Rotor and housings are steel.

<P> Power is remarkable, evocative of engines in the range of .35 to
.45, which is good because it weighs more than the average .30.
Operation of the engine is very smooth.  The engine responds well to
muffling and is very quiet.  The engine starts more easily if it is
"quite wet", which make sense for sealing.  Fuel consumption seemed a
little on the high side, about 8 to 10 minutes on a six ounce tank.

<P> Ira Jersey reports that the engine will run well with a 10/6
propeller and recommends "20% synthetic caster blend 50/50/10% nitro,
especially S&#38;W".
