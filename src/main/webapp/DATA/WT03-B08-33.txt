Eichrom's Diphonix
Shows Specificity

The Diphonix ion-exchange resin produced by Eichrom Industries Inc.
(8205 S. Cass Ave., Suite 107, Darien, IL 60561; Tel: 708/963-0320,
Fax: 708/963-0381) has metal-ion specificity that enables it to
remove radionuclides and metals selectively from aqueous solutions.
This high-performance, gel-type cation resin displays exceptional
ionic selectivity, tremendous capacity, and a rapid rate of
complexation.  The selectivity, capacity, and exchange kinetics of
the Eichrom resin allows performance enhancements in an array of
applications where selective separation is important.

In contrast to other commercially available ion-exchange resins,
Eichrom's Diphonix resin is polyfunctional, with two distinct
functional groups.  Each of these groups contributes to the resin's
performance.  The Diphonix resin is constructed of a
polystyrene/divinylbenzene matrix in a spherical bead form (in a
tightly controlled size range).

Chemically bonded to the polymer matrix are diphosphonic and
sulfonic acid groups.  The primary exchange group is geminally
substituted diphosphonic acid (with a content of 1.2-1.6 mmol of
phosphorus per dry gram of resin).  These unique ligands form
extremely stable complexes with a number of metal ions and are
responsible the Diphonix resin's metal ion specificity.
Incorporated into the matrix at the time of polymerization, the
diphosphonic acid functional group is physically stable over a wide
range of thermal and chemical conditions.

Resin activity is exceptional in acidic solutions where the
Diphonix resin's contains complexed metals under conditions that
for most ion exchangers would effect the resin regeneration.  The
diphosphonic acid ligand retains metals effectively at pH values of
2 and under, conditions that many resins would see as regenerating.
The resin can remove trace metals from acid solutions used in the
semiconductor industry for product washing and etching, allowing
the reuse of the solutions.

The secondary exchange sites in the Diphonix resin are comprised of
sulfonic acid groups.  Contained with the polymer matrix, these
ligands make the resin very hydrophobic.  As a result, they enhance
metal ion accessibility into the polymer network and significantly
improve the ion-exchange kinetics of the Diphonix resins.

The Diphonix ion-exchange resin is ideally suited for
ultrapurification, metallurgical processing applications, treatment
of radioactive effluents, industrial wastewater treatment, and
environmental remediation.  In these applications, the resin
preferentially interacts with metal ions in liquid solutions,
providing a cost-effective way of removing metals from process or
waste solutions.  Metal selectivity is maintained even in the
presence of a high concentration of competing cations, such as
sodium, calcium, and magnesium.  The Diphonix resin reduces the
metal concentrations to the level required, while rejecting
unregulated ions (i.e., the competing cations).  Metals can be
extracted via ion exchange instead of by alkaline precipitation.

By utilizing a bed of Diphonix resin, a sidestream arrangement,
contaminant residuals in process streams can be controlled.
Diphonix resin shows exceptional selectivity for a number of
radionuclide species.  In nuclear power plants, contaminated
radwaste can be treated at a reduced cost compared to conventional
ion-exchange resins.  The Diphonix resin's capacity is not spent on
non-regulated species.  Additionally, in soil or water remediation,
the resin's high reactivity achieves removal to the lowest possible
concentration.

The resin's preference for metal ions makes the effective capacity
for metals higher than non-selective cation resins.  On a total
exchange basis, the capacity compares with non-selective resins of
similar crosslink percentage.  Capacity values for all resin forms
(determined by bead size and percent crosslinkage) are available
from Eichrom.  The firm offers the Diphonix resin in a variety of
bead sizes and crosslinkage percentages that suit a number of
laboratory and process applications.

The Diphonix resin is the result of breakthrough technologies
developed by Argonne National Laboratory and the University of
Tennessee, where Spiro D. Alexandratos determined that
bifunctionality and intra-ligand cooperation played important roles
in ensuring metal ion selectivity when phosphorus acid ligands were
covalently bonded to polystyrene beads.

Building upon this technological base, Eichrom has developed a
significant array of new products that stem from three innovative
core technologies:  Selective ion-exchange resins, extraction
chromatographic resins, and specific extractants.  Sectors in which
Eichrom is involved include the following:

Increased productivity, waste minimization, and cost reduction for
environmental laboratories;

Extraction chromatographic resins for the selective separation of
radium, cesium, and tritium;

Enhanced analysis and removal capabilities for actinides,
strontium, and technetium;

Separation of ultrapure isotopes for radiopharmaceutical
applications; and

Advanced separations products for industrial and environmental
applications, including ultrapure reagents, hydrometallurgy, and
radioactive wastes.

System Reuses 95% of
Copper Rinse Water

A water-recycling system from the Engineered Systems Division of
Kinetico Inc. (10845 Kinsman Road, Newbury, OH 44065; Tel: 800/633-
5530) will enable West Coast Circuits (Watsonville, CA) to recycle
more than 95% of the copper rinse waters used in its printed
circuit fabrication process.  The unique design of the 20- to 30-
gpm system will produce high-purity deionized water that will
improve product quality and reduce water and sewer costs.

Ion-exchange technology is used to recover heavy metals and
minimize waste at West Coast Circuits facility, thereby reducing
its cost of hauling the wastewater discharge off-site.  The
Kinetico water-recycling system features countercurrent process to
regenerate the ion-exchange resins used.  The process regenerates
the resin columns with acid for the metal cations and caustic for
the anions injected from the opposite flow direction. This process
design uses up to 50% fewer chemicals, produces less waste
regenerant, and utilizes resin capacity more effectively.

The Kinetico division has also sold a Waste Minimization System to
Motorola Semiconductors Hong Kong Ltd. (Taipo, Hong Kong), an
international semiconductor manufacturer.  The system, which
combines ion-exchange technology with electrowinning, will provide
Motorola with high-purity water recycling, metal recovery, and
waste minimization.

The two-part Kinetico system consists of a rinse-water recycling
system and a metal scavenging system.  The 60 gpm rinse-water
recycling system will recycle rinse water from four Technic Plater
lines.  It will also treat the dragout rinses after process steps
in the manufacturing of semiconductors.  This design will improve
environmental performance, reduce water and sewer bills, and lower
operating costs.

The 12 gpm metal-scavenging system selectively removes metals to
lower discharge limits; therefore, minimal water treatment is
needed before discharge.  The system is integrated with a 25-
square-foot electrolytic metal recovery system and waste-acid
recovery system to recover copper and tin/lead in metallic form
from the dragout and flowing rinses.  This minimizes wastewater
flows to the existing treatment system and reduces the amount of
sludge produced, thereby lowering the waste-effluent quality.

For more information on Kinetico systems and the firm's line of
deionization, ion-exchange, electrowinning, and membrane systems
for process and wastewater treatment, contact Teresa Saloka.
Standard and custom systems are available for water recycling,
metal recovery, and waste minimization.  These systems are ideal
for applications in the metal finishing, electronics, printed
circuit board, semiconductor, groundwater remediation, and a
variety of other industries.  Kinetico is an authorized OEM for
Rohm & Haas pollution-control resins and Koch Membrane Systems.

Metal Recovered
from Residues

A two-phase process from Cabot Corp. (157 Concord Road, Billerica,
MA 01821-7101; Tel: 508/663-3455) recovers metal and acid values
from a metallic fluorides-containing source material.  Invented by
Robert A. Hard and protected by U.S. Patent 5,437,848, the process
digests the source material in sulfuric acid.  This digestion forms
a slurry that separates into two phases:

A fluoride-containing solid phase; and

A metal-containing first-liquid phase.

Hard writes that subjecting the solid phase to pyrohydrolysis
allows the recovery of sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids.

The liquid phase is then processed, via solvent extraction or ion
exchange, to recover the metal values.  A water-immiscible organic
extractant, such as methylisobutyl ketone, extracts the tantalum
values, and water strips it from the first organic phase.  The
process includes the additional steps of heating the separated
solid phase from ambient to elevated temperatures, in the presence
of water vapor, to evolve sulfuric acid and render the gangue
chemically inert.

When the source material contains uranium, the digestion step
reduces the amount of gangue present in the radioactive source. The
process can include the additional steps of removing uranium from
the liquid phase, by either an ion-exchange resin or by solvent
extraction.  This removal process also uses a water-immiscible
organic extractant to yield a uranium-depleted aqueous phase that
can be treated with an aqueous solution of calcium oxide.  Sulfuric
acid and the organic extractant for extracting uranium can be
recycled if desired.

Method Purifies
Crude Proteins

David Naveh and John C. Tang of Schering Nederland B.V. (Van
Houten, Industriepark 1, NL-1381 MZ Weesp, The Netherlands; Tel:
0031-2940-62424, Fax: 0031-2940-18336) have invented an ion-
exchange chromatography technique that purifies proteins.  The
crude protein mixture contains one or more undesirable proteins of
unknown isoelectric points.  Naveh and Tang use either computer
simulation or isoelectric focusing gels to determine the
isoelectric points of proteins in the crude protein mixture.

The pH for the ion-exchange chromatography is adjusted to a point
between the ranges of isoelectric points of the protein fractions
to be separated.  Separation occurs when contact is made between
the ion-exchange resin and the crude protein mixture.  Since the
proteins in the first and second fractions are oppositely charged,
only one of the fractions binds to the ion-exchange resin.  U.S.
Patent 5,451,662, which protects the technique, also discloses
details on the purification of GM-CSF using a cation-exchange
resin.

Zero Emissions Close
with Nomex Delta

The hot-gas filtration industry has been seeking technology with
higher filtration efficiency and greater air-pollution control. One
goal of the industry is dry-particulate filtration media with
efficiencies that approach zero emissions.

That goal moved closer to the realm of possibility with the
introduction of Nomex Delta Micro by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and
Co. (1007 Market St., Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel: 302/774-1000). The
product combines high separation efficiency with low differential
pressure.  This combination results in significantly improved
surface filtration and reduced operating costs.

Based on the Du Pont's well-known Nomex fiber technology, Nomex
Delta Micro filters are composed of high-temperature-resistant
meta-aramid fibers.  The fibers measure only 0.78 dtex and have a
69% greater surface area than the 2.2 dtex aramid fibers used in
conventional aramid fibers.  These attributes enable users to
produce microporous needlefelts with more density and excellent
surface-filtration properties.

Most importantly, especially in filter cleaning and recovering
valuable production elements, the dense micropore filter surface
retains a greater proportion of dust particles than conventional
filters.  The microporous fleece structure of Nomex Delta Micro
filters causes the initial dust-cake phase to build up more
effectively.  Additionally, the structure prevents the dust-
particle penetration common to felts with larger, more open pores.

Launched worldwide, Nomex Delta Micro filters meet the new German
VDI Guideline 3926 that evaluates cleanable filter media.  Long-
term filtration behavior tests confirm that the dust-leakage values
of the new filters are significantly better than with standard
Nomex fibers or with other meta-aramid filter felts. The tests also
reveal that emission reductions with the Nomex Delta Micro filters
are comparable to (equivalent with) higher-priced laminated
filters.

Laboratory tests show that the new technology has a lower pressure-
drop value than standard filter felts.  DuPont reports that the
higher air-to-cloth capability of needlefelts composed of Nomex
Delta Micro filters allows more flue gas per square meter of felt
surface to be treated.  Therefore, the firm states that users need
to clean the filters less frequently. Another added benefit is that
the filters could make smaller, less expensive ventilation systems
feasible.  The lightweight capability of the ultrafine fibers could
potentially lead to reduced operating costs, without any loss any
filtration efficiency.

Du Pont  notes that the chemical resistance of filter felts
composed of the new fibers equals or excels that of standard (2.2
dtex) Nomex filter felts.  Both the standard and the new Nomex
filters perform well mechanically and demonstrate dimensional
stability at operating temperatures up to 200oC.  They provide an
extensive safety margin for temperature surges.

Information on Nomex Delta Micro may be obtained from Fleet Smith
(Tel: 302/999-3419), Nomex marketing manager for Du Pont.

Osmonics Holding
More of the Dirt

Increased dirt-holding capacity (DHC) or contaminant loading of
filters has been a continuous goal of filter manufacturers and a
continuous desire of filter users.  This is because increased DHC
results in more economical filtration.  However, it is difficult to
achieve higher DHC without compromising the efficiency of the
filter.

Most filter manufacturers have devised increasing DHC by improving
the filter media.  The amount any filter medium can hold is
directly proportional to the void volume or open area in the media.
Over the years, millions of dollars have been spent on developing
media that will hold more contaminant.  It is a difficult task
because in any given medium, if you increase the void volume, you
decrease contaminant-removal efficiency.

To increase DNC without compromising removal efficiency,
manufacturers have altered the structure of the media.  Despite
using finer fibers, greater loft, more entanglement, and multiple
layers, or by forming asymmetric pores and creating greater pore
density, filter media manufacturers have been able to achieve only
modest increases in DNC.

Spiraltek rolled-cartridge filters from Osmonics (5951 Clearwater
Drive, Minnetonka, MN  55343;  Tel: 612/933-2277,  Fax: 612/933-
0141) represent a new concept in filtration.  The filter was
developed using a knowledge of crossflow technology.  In crossflow
filtration, the media is continuously cleaned by the process fluid
that flows across the media surface.  The fluid flow is
mechanically restricted downstream, such that a portion of the flow
passes through the media, while the remainder passes beyond the
restriction. The portion that did not go through the media contains
a concentrated level of contaminant.

Spiraltek filters employ the basics of crossflow filtration, but
the downstream restriction is entirely closed.  The result is a
fluid flow that continuously cleans the media surface without a
secondary stream containing concentrated contaminant.  As
contaminant is pushed towards the sealed end of the filter, the
contaminant packs against itself in a non-porous section of the
filter.  Restriction to flow increases very slowly, and the filter
operates steadily for a longer period of time.  The end result is
less dependence on the void volume of the media for increased DNC
and a quantum increase in DNC based on the filter construction.

The new filters have been successfully applied in the field, and
subjected to unbiased, head-to-head comparison testing.  Test
results show that Spiraltek filters hold three to six times more
contaminant per square foot of filter media when compared to other
pleated filters.

ECC Merges North
American Units

As part of its strategy to become the leading supplier of
technology-based, value-added minerals and chemicals to the
industries it serves, English China Clays (1015 Arlington Business
Park, Theale, Reading RG7 4SA, England; Tel: 01734-304010, Fax:
01734-309500) has merged its North American paper business units.
The merged units will operate as ECC International Inc. AmPac Paper
Group.

The merger enables ECC, the world's leading supplier of pigments to
the paper industry, "through a single organization, to deliver
improved levels of service and products," says Andrew Teare, ECC's
executive director.  Teare notes that the merger furthers a
transition begun in the early 1990s from ECC's "being a minerals
and construction business into a specialty minerals and chemicals
company.  A major step in the strategy was the acquisition in 1993
of the specialty chemical company Calgon Corp."

Teare adds that "within Europe, it is expected that as Calgon
expands it services to the paper industry, a similar combined
minerals and specialty chemicals structure will also be an
effective means of serving the paper industry."

For more information on the merger, contact Harriet Bowen (Tel:
404/303-4396) at ECCI AmPac or Perry Colosimo (Tel: 412/494-8485)

Close-Out Sales
Affect Revenues

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Polymer
Systems Inc. John J. Meakam Jr. (3696 Haven Ave., Redwood City, CA
94063; Tel: 415/366-2626, Fax: 415/365-6490) cites large close-out
sales of an older version of its Take-Off product as a reason for
its 1995 third-quarter revenues ($3,057,000) being slightly lower
than its 1994 third-quarter revenues ($3,398,000). During the third
quarter of 1994, APS replaced its Take-Off make-up remover with an
updated version that incorporated its Microsponge systems.  Close-
out sales of the older version moved rapidly and created a slight
jump in 1994 third-quarter sales.

Meakam attributes the decrease in revenues to low sales of
unlicensed suncare products, which do not include Advanced
Polymer's delivery-system technology.  Licensing revenues for the
third quarter were down, primarily due to variations in the timing
of payments from Ortho Pharmaceuticals.  However, licensing
revenues were up for the first nine months of 1995 ($12,939,000)
compared to the same period in 1994 ($12,870,000).

Even though APS has experienced overall revenue decreases in the
1995 third quarter, Meakam adds that "it is important to note that
revenues from products that incorporate our delivery-systems
technology were up 36% for the quarter.  This growth was due to
increased sales of established products and the introduction of new
products.  Most notably, third-quarter 1995 sales of the Exact line
of acne products were up 94% compared with the same period in 1994,
due partly to the introduction of our four new Exact line
extensions."

Operating expenses for the quarter were down 7% overall to last
year.  Reduced spending for now-completed clinical studies of two
ethical pharmaceutical products decreased R&D expenses by $725,000.
At the same time, selling, marketing, advertising, and promotion
expenses for the quarter increased by $469,000 due to the
introduction of the Exact line extensions.

To gain operating cash without diluting its stock, APS completed
two financing arrangements, during the third quarter of 1995. The
firm switched from current to long-term debt and raised extra cash.
Certain assets and the operating cash flows of a subsidiary secure
these loans.

With its strong delivery system platforms and expanding technology
applications, Meacham feels that APS is in a position to focus on
opportunities that offer the greatest potential for increasing
shareholder value (its stocks decreased to $0.12 in the third
quarter 1995 from $0.17 in the same period of 1994).

The firm's objective is to use its technology base to form new
strategic alliances and licensing agreements that offer the
potential to increase its commercial opportunities significantly,
both in the near term and the long term.  Recent discussions with
prospective partners has increased APS' appreciation for the
breadth of its technologies and the potential that lies ahead.

Partial Resolution of
Enflurane with TOT

The preparative resolution (asymmetric synthesis) of current
inhalation anesthetics (i.e. enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane)
via inclusion complexes presents a challenge to researchers.  The
challenge lies in the how to produce inclusion complexes of the
anesthetics that consist of small, apolar molecules These molecules
lack the functional groups normally used for inclusion complexation
or for attachment of a chiral auxiliary. Producing chiral-inclusion
compounds with inhalation anesthetics could offer pharmaceutical
companies a means of obtaining large amounts of enantiomerically
pure (highly enriched) products.

Toward this end, a multinational research effort between Israeli
and German chemists, with funding coming from an Israeli-U.S.
foundation grant and from German industries, has been working on
cage-type clathrate-inclusion complexes.  The chemists believe that
enclathration may serve as a means of obtaining sufficient
quantities of pure enantiomers, especially of the two kinds needed
to conduct chiroptical and biological studies.  The availability of
such enantiomers could allow researchers to determine whether they
undergo a different metabolism, another problem that plagues
anesthesiology.

Israeli chemists involved in the effort include Jallal M. Gnaim
(The Institutes for Applied Research, Ben-Gurion University of the
Negev, P.O. Box 653, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel) and Bernard S. Green
(Dept. of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The School of Pharmacy, The
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, P.O. Box 12065, Jerusalem 91120,
Israel).  The two Germans, Volker Schurig and Heiko Grosenik, are
chemists at the Institut fr Organishe Chemie, Universitt
Tbingen, Auf der Morgenselle 18, D 7400, Tbingen 1, Germany).

The team's efforts have resulted in cage-type clathrate-inclusion
complexes of tri-o-thymotide (TOT) that yield partial preparative
resolution of enflurane.  The partial preparative resolution occurs
after a single crystallization step of TOT from solutions of
enflurane in 2,24-trimethylpentane.  Gas chromatography (a column
coated with polymeric chiral-phase Chirasil-Dex) reveals that the
single crystals contain 38% ee of enflurane.  Further
crystallization of TOT-enflurane clathrate crystals enhances the ee
level.  The chemists have found that, in some cases, the first
enantiomer eluted predominates, while, in other cases, the
enantiomer eluted last predominates.

To prepare the clathrates, the chemists obtained a solvent-free TOT
by synthesizing and crystallizing a TOT-ethanol complex, which was
warmed to 130oC at 0.2 mm/g for 24 hours and recrystallized.  They
dissolved 0.2 g of the TOT in 1.0 ml of boiling enflurane and added
9.0 ml of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (TMP).  Addition of the TMP
facilitated cage-type clathrate nucleation and lowered the
solution's density, in order to prevent the growing crystal from
floating on top of the solution.  The team then filtered and slow
cooled the complex, prior to filtering and washing the resultant
crystals with 1 ml of cold methanol.  This latter step yielded 0.08
g of large, colorless cubic crystals with a TOT:enflurane ratio of
2:1, with no TMP present.

In Tetrahedron: Asymmetry [6(7), 1499-1502, 1995], the research
team describes the TOT molecules as homochiral in each crystal;
therefore, enclathration produces an enantiomerically enriched
enflurane.  Measurement of the TOT optical rotation occurs prior to
full racemization and once again if the concentration is sufficient
to warrant it.

Activator Prepared
from Snake Venom

A method from Pentapharm AG (Buros: Engelgasse 109, Ch-4002, Basel,
Switzerland; Tel: 061-312-9680, Fax: 061-311-2049) prepares a
phospholipid-dependent prothrombin activator from the venom of
snakes belonging to the Elapidae family.  The venom is adsorbed on
a water-insoluble barium, magnesium, calcium or aluminum salt.  The
activator is eluted from the venom with an aqueous solution of
alkali-, ammonium-, or organic amine salts to form insoluble salts,
complexes or chelates with alkaline earth or aluminum ions.  The
eluted salts are removed, and the activator is recovered.

Developed by Douglas A. Triplett and Kurt Stocker and protected by
U.S. Patent 5,453,370, the activator increases plasma clotting
activity in the presence of phospholipids and calcium ions. In the
presence of Lupus Anticoagulant, the activator exhibits reduced
activity.  The activator facilitates clotting in a normal clotting
time in the presence of platelet-poor plasma. The plasma has normal
or decreased levels of factor V, VII, VIII, IX, or X and a major
band with a molecular weight of 40,000 to 60,000 daltons on an SDS
gel.

Suction-Type Filter
Neutralizes PVC Gases

Kenro Motoda of Motoda Electronics Co. Ltd. (17-11, Kamitakaido 1-
chome, Suginami-ku, Tokyo 168, Japan; Tel: 03-3303-8491, Fax: 03-
3329-5519) has discovered a means of removing chlorine from the
gases generated in the treatment of hydrogen and polyvinyl chloride
wastes.  The method utilizes a suction-type solution filter
container to neutralize and dissolve the chlorine gas. The filter
contains activated carbon or other materials with excellent
adsorbability to post treat residues of the wastes.

U.S. Patent 5,449,398 describes how the hydrogen and polyvinyl
chloride wastes are put in the sealed container and heated at 400oC
or less, without oxygen or with air-blocked condition. Heating
extracts the chlorine and hydrogen chloride gases from the wastes.
The extracted gases are then put into the suction-type solution
filter container.  The container also contains liquid filtration
agents through which the gases pass.  The chlorine is removed and
reduced in volume from the wastes in the sealed container.

VARA's Says Its
Record's Proven

For over 20 years, VARA International (1201 195th Place, Vero
Beach, FL 32960; Tel: 407/567-1320, Fax: 407/567-4108), a division
of Calgon Carbon Corp., has created, tested, and installed the most
technically advanced and successful pollution-abatement systems.
Based on proven carbon adsorption and distillation technology,
these systems meet the unique requirements of clients in many
different countries.

The VARA solvent-recovery system enables users to recycle and reuse
up to 99+% of their solvents.  The system consists of an activated
carbon-adsorption unit with a minimum of two adsorber vessels and,
if required, a liquid air-stripping or distillation unit.  Solvent-
laden air passes through the adsorber vessel where its solvent
vapors are adsorbed by specially selected activated carbons.  The
amount and depth of activated carbon in the adsorber vessel is
determined by the users' system requirements.

The sequencing of adsorption and regeneration cycles is alternated
to ensure that each carbon adsorber is on-line for an equivalent
period.  The result is a continuous and automatic processing of
solvent-laden air.

During the regeneration cycle of the VARA solvent recovery system,
low-pressure steam strips the solvent vapors from the carbon.
After the steam/solvent mixture is condensed and cooled, it passes
through a decanter where the solvents and water separate by
relative solubilities and specific gravities into a water phase and
a solvent phase.  Generally, water-insoluble solvents can be reused
directly.

If required, water-soluble solvents and complex solvent blends are
further separated, dehydrated and/or purified through liquid
distillation.  VARA offers complete extractive and azeotropic
multi-component distillation systems for the separation and
purification of solvent mixtures.  Depending upon customer and
process requirements, these systems can be designed for either
continuous or batch operations.

VARA's custom-designed units can handle solvent-laden air stream
flows from 500 to 1,000,000 cfm.  Packaged vertical or horizontal
solvent recovery units handle 1,000 to 20,000 cfm.

Selective Coated
Powders for PSA

Over the past 20 years, adsorptive gas separation, especially in
pressure-swing adsorption (PSA), has been the focus of considerable
research.  Many researchers believe that coated adsorbents would
expand the applicability of PSA to the separation of a wider range
of gas mixtures.  Based on the premise that coated absorbents
enhance selectivity, R. van der Vaart and his cohorts at the
University of Twente (Faculty of Chemical Technology, P.O. Box 217,
7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands) have taken a first step in the
development of coated adsorbents for PSA.

The scientists coated a dense cellulose acetate membrane on the
outer surface of a porous tablet of compressed activated-carbon
powder.  A powdered Norit Americas (RB1) activated carbon was
pressed to a diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, using
bentonite as a binder.  The tablet was pyrolyzed at 1073 K in a
nitrogen atmosphere, and it was then dipped on side with a 14%
cellulose acetate solution (from Eastman Kodak) in a DMF from
Merck.  The tablet's pores were blocked with a filler that
evaporated during the coating process.  The coated tablet was then
dried in a pure nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature.

Since permeability was found to be independent of pressure, the
investigators concluded that a defect-free membrane was prepared
and could be used in a limited test of their model.   They observed
uptake times that corresponded to cycle times of kinetic PSA
applications. Preliminary calculations indicated that the coated
adsorbents show promising viability in these applications. The
scientists are conducting an extensive experimental program to
substantiate their preliminary results.  The focus of that program
is highly permeable silicone rubber coatings rather than the low-
permeable cellulose acetate coatings.

Nonwovens Add
Mechanical Strength

Semipermeable membranes have no mechanical strength and need to be
supported during the filtration process.  Support can be provided
via perforated tubes or channelled plates (i.e. porous, non-
compressable support materials).  These types of support materials
come in the form of PVC or stainless steel tubes or plastic plates.
The high pressures (e.g. 1-140 bar) often necessitated by the
process mean that the distance between the holes or channels must
be relatively large to retain the mechanical strength of such
support materials. A porous, non-compressable supporting layer is
used between the semipermeable membrane and the supporting element
to provide a drainage layer.

Produced by Freudenberg Nonwovens L.P. (20 Industrial Ave.,
Chelmsford, MA 01824; Tel: 508/454-0461, Fax: 508/256-6214),
Viledon nonwovens add mechanical strength and provide custom-made
support and drainage layers for semipermeable membranes.  Viledon
Nonwovens meet the demands of industry by offering the following
advantages:

  high homogeneity and thus uniform porosity;
  smooth surfaces;
  no projecting fibers; and
  good processability during the demanding membrane-coating
process;

Used for reverse osmosis, microfiltration, and ultrafiltration,
Viledon nonwovens are usually coated directly with the membrane
solution.  When used in the various module systems, the nonwoven
provides direct support for the delicate membranes.  An equally
important factor is uniform distribution and drainage of the
permeate, for which the porous structure of the nonwoven is
advantageous.

Viledon nonwovens are successfully employed plate, spiral-wound,
and tubular configurations.  In the plate module, the permeate
passes through the membrane and is drained off in a drainage layer
or in drainage channels.  In the spiral-wound module, a nonwoven
sheet is laminated on one side with the membrane and sealed at the
edges to a second sheet, thereby forming a virtually continuous
"bag."

Especially for tubular modules, Viledon nonwovens meet high demands
with respect to rigidity and mechanical strength.  The nonwovens
are initially welded to form a tube and them laminated on the
inside with the membrane.  This tube is inserted into a perforated
metal or plastic pressure tube, which provides the support.

Marketing questions on Viledon nonwovens should be directed to
Shari Fowler-Hutchinson at Freudenberg's Chelmsford location.

Oxygen Selection on
Carbon Substrate

A method developed by Timothy Golden et al for Air Products and
Chemicals Inc. (7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195; Tel:
610/481-4911) makes an oxygen (O2)-selective adsorbent with a
porous substrate, such as carbon molecular sieve, activated carbon,
carbon black, coal, or petroleum coke.  The substrate is
impregnated with an acidic solution and then dried.  The oxygen
selective adsorbent, which is protected by U.S. Patent 5,447,557,
can be used in a pressure-swing adsorption process for the
separation of oxygen from nitrogen, for example, in air.

Another R&D effort at Air Products has resulted in U.S. Patent
5,451,385 for a process that controls exhaust emissions from
methane-fueled internal combustion engines.  Developed by James G.
Hansel et al, the process utilizes a crystalline zeolite to remove
nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide from the exhaust emissions.
The zeolite catalyst causes the carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,
and oxygen in the exhaust gas to react with methane.

The catalyst has a silicon-to-aluminum ratio of equal to or greater
than about 2.5.  It is prepared by ion exchange of a non-acid
sodium or ammonium form of crystalline zeolite with one or more
cations selected from cobalt, nickel, iron, chromium, and
manganese.  The zeolite is exchanged with from 0.1 to about 15 wt
% of the cation, based on the total weight of the exchanged
zeolite.  The metal-exchanged zeolite is impregnated with from 0.1
to 23 wt % alumina, based upon the total weight of the impregnated
metal-exchanged zeolite.

Material Combines
Ceramic and Fibers

With a goal of becoming the largest "full line" supplier of high-
temperature insulation products, the Carborundum Co. (Fibers Div.,
P.O. Box 808, Niagara Falls, NY 14302; Tel: 716/278-2203, Fax:
716/278-2440) is readying a panel version of its Excelfrax product
line.  Other Excelfrax product forms, including Excelblok rigid-
board insulation, are in the development stage.

The developmental products, as well as the firm's commmercialized
flexible blanket form called the Excelflex Composite Systems, are
based on Excelfrax's core high-temperature insulation material.
This material blends ceramic (alumina and silica) powders and
fibers to produce a microporous structure.  The structure decreases
radiant heat flow, thereby making Excelfrax materials extremely
efficient insulation materials.  The core material can be
manufactured into a variety of product forms, including composite
systems, molded shapes, and rigid boards.

The firm's Excelflex Composite Systems are composed of a high-
temperature (1800oF) core material that has been placed between two
layers of a high-temperature textile.  The standard textile is a
1200oF S-Glass.  However, various high-temperature textiles can be
used in the composite to provide protection from 500oF to 2,300oF.
The layers are compressed into a uniform thickness (ranging from
1/8-inch to 1/2-inch) and density (both standard and lightweight).
The layers are then quilted into a finished composite.  The
Excelflex's standard configuration is 36" x 36" pads that are lock-
stitched into one-inch squares.

Market manager of Carborundum's Fibers Division, Jim Olchawski
(Tel: 716/278-2008, Fax: 716/278-2440), calls Excelflex's extremely
good thermal conductivity its main advantage.  Because of this
excellent thermal performance, Excelflex will provide the maximum
amount of insulation within the smallest amount of weight and
space.  Stable at high temperatures, Excelflex has low thermal
diffusivity and excellent material strength characteristics. Also,
Excelflex's flexiblity and ease of fabrication are important
considerations for many applications.

Excelflex provides the best insulation (lowest thermal
conductivity) of all the insulating products currently provided by
Carborundum.  Olchawski recommends it as the material of choice
whenever high-temperature insulating materials are required and
space/weight savings are the primary consideration.  Excelflex
Composite Systems can reduce heat loss and reduce surface
temperatures in a variety of materials, including
aerospace/defense, industrial, and commercial markets.

Aerospace/defense applications for Excelflex include thermal
insulation/fire protection in aircraft engine struts, nacelles,
cowlings, and avionics.  Industrial applications can be found in
nuclear power plants, petrochemical facilities, and other
industrial areas (i.e. incinerators, heat-treatment furnaces,
insulation for kilns and furnaces, and other metal/glass processing
industries).  Commercial applications include commercial ovens,
night storage heaters, and many other appliance applications.

Olchawski explains that Excelfrax is a "natural," the direct result
of two principal factors: The company's technical capabilities,
developed over many years while working with Fiberfrax refractory
ceramic fibers in the same markets and the partnerships created
between the company's full-service applications engineering team
and Carborundum customers in developing critical design solutions
for any application.

Molecular Diffusion
in a Single Crystal

Both industry and the scientific community are paying attention to
zeolites as novel adsorbents and catalysts.  Significant attention
has been paid to the measurement of diffusivity in zeolites, but
there has been little attention paid to applications based on
differences in the rates of transport of molecules in zeolite
micropores.  However, microscopic methods that measure molecular
diffusion are beginning to surface.

One of these methods has been investigated by Orhan Tula, D.B.
Shah, and Shaozhuang Sun of Cleveland State University (Dept. of
Chemical Engineering, Cleveland, OH 44115).  Their method involves
modifying a single-crystal zeolite membrane.  The modification
consists of incorporating a high-sensitivity Mass Selective
Detector (MSD) into the membrane.  The MSD determines the
concentration of the diffusing species on the receiving side.  It
measures the small increase in concentration that occurs as a small
amount of substance diffuses through the crystal.

Tula et al report that the modification yields a more accurate
measurement.  Modifying the membrane with the MSD also enables the
research to use a setup that measures directional diffusivity, as
well as concurrent and countercurrent diffusion.  To test the
efficacy of its modification, the investigators measured the
intracrystalline diffusivities of normal alkanes through silicates.

The scientists results show a corresponding increase of the
diffusivities of the hydrocarbons as the carbon number rises, due
to critical diameters being almost the same.  However, the length
of the molecules affect diffusion.  Ethane with a length double
that of methane exhibits a significant decrease in diffusivity over
methane.  Therefore, the team asserts that with carbon numbers less
than six, the critical diameter is the major influence on the
diffusion process.  With numbers larger than six, the hydrocarbons
exhibit a more relative diffusion decrease.

Some difficulties need to be overcome before the full potential of
MSD modification can be realized. Problems with MSD calibration at
low concentration need to be solved.  The zeolite membranes need to
be made from larger crystals.  Researchers need a good embedding
method, one that can withstand high temperatures, in order to
measure diffusivities at elevated levels.

Solid/Solid Reaction
Prepares Redox V

E.M. El Malki and a host of researchers from the University of
Pierre and Marie Curie (Laboratoire de Reactivite de Surface,
Paris, France) have prepared redox molecular sieves by solid-solid
reactions, using a thermally pretreated vanadium (V)/beta-molecular
sieve mixture.  Measurement techniques indicate that thermal
pretreatment at intense temperatures (900oF) reduces only 6% of the
vanadium in the mixture.

Calcination causes the solid-solid reaction to disperse the
vanadium ions inside the zeolite channels.  Tests indicate that, in
dehydrated samples, superhyperfine interactions occur between the
unpaired electron of vanadyl cations and the aluminum nuclei. In
hydrated samples, though, evidence exists of intraporosity in
vanadium tetrahedral species, which are difficult to rehydrate. The
researchers surmise this evidence from the persistence of a band
260 nm at long hydration periods (about 8 days).

X-ray diffraction reveals the beta-molecular sieve to be unaltered
by the intraporosity vanadium species, even after pretreatment.  It
is cautioned that weakening of the zeolite framework could occur
since BET tests indicate a porosity decrease in the presence of the
vanadium species.  The researchers present their conclusions in the
Proceedings of the American Chemical Society, Division of Petroleum
Chemistry [40(1), 114-18, 1995].

Adsorption Isotherms
Determined, Modeled

Much research has gone into aluminophosphate molecular sieves,
particularly in the area of their water-adsorption characteristics.
Citing a lack of literature on the single and/or multicomponent
adsorption of permanent gases (i.e. nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and
methane) at room temperature by these adsorbates, a trio of
University of Ottawa (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, 161 Louis-
Pasteur, P.O. Box 450, Stn. 4, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada)
researchers headed by F.H. Tezel have conducted an investigation.

Their investigation has resulted in a determination of adsorption
isotherms for a number of the permanent gases.  The determination
comes from studying adsorption on three molecular sieves (AlPO4-11,
AlPO4-17, and AlPO4-18) at temperatures between 23oC and 40oC and
pressures up to 120 kPa.

A decrease in the slope of the AlPO4-11's isotherms as the
temperature rises indicates the lower adsorptive capacity of this
molecular sieve at high temperatures.  This adsorbate exhibits its
greatest capacity with methane and its lowest with nitrogen. Tezel
et al attribute this to the "equal access" offered by this medium-
pore molecular sieve to all gaseous adsorbates smaller than those
of its pore aperture (3.9 x 5.1 in pore dimensions).  Methane,
being the largest molecule (4.2 ), is easily trapped within the
3.9 x 5.1  of the AlPO4-11.  Nitrogen, being the smallest molecule
(3.0 x 4.1 ), easily leaves the adsorbed phase and is less easily
retained than the other gases.  The molecular sieve features
intermediate capacity values for carbon monoxide (3.7 x 4.2 ).

Tezel recognizes that AlPO4-11 adsorbs methane more readily than it
does nitrogen and carbon monoxide at 40oC.  He attributes this to
its larger molecular size and its energetic homogeneity and adds
that the nitrogen isotherm lies about the carbon monoxide isotherm.
He explains this latter condition as a result of neighboring
quadrupolar nitrogen molecules that repel each other to a lesser
extent than do neighboring polar carbon monoxide molecules.  The
smaller nitrogen molecules enter the molecular sieve pore openings
more easily than the larger carbon monoxide molecules.

For AlPO4-18, Tezel gives the following adsorptive capacity
decrease order at 40oC and 120 kPa: Carbon monoxide, methane, and
nitrogen.  He explains that the researchers noticed a slight S-
shape behavior for the carbon monoxide isotherm within the very low
pressure range.  The other isotherms of the other two gases exhibit
linear tendencies for the entire pressure range.

Based on their data, Tezel and his colleagues have been able to
model the adsorption isotherms, using Langmuir, Flory Huggins-
Vacancy Solution Theory, and Freundlich equations.  Tezel reports
that the team has  been able to predict binary adsorption
equilibria for the permanent gases and that stearic effects
regulate the adsorption mechanism in all three adsorbents.

Solid-Phase Extraction
Isolates and Purifies

Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is a powerful tool for chemical
isolation and purification.  From trace-level sample preparation to
industrial-scale chemical isolation, SPE plays an increasingly
important role in a broad range of applications, including
pharmaceutical, clinical, fine chemical, biomedical, food analyses,
organic synthesis, environmental, and many others.  SPE utilizes
the same analyte/sorbent interactions that are exploited in the
powerful separation technique of high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).

Varian Sample Preparation Products (24201 Frampton Ave., Harbor
City, CA 90710; Tel: 310/539-6490 or 800/421-2825, Fax: 310/539-
4270), formerly known as Analytichem International, pioneered
solid-phase extraction technology with the introduction of the Bond
Elut SPE extraction cartridge.  Normally, the cartridge is packed
in straight-walled syringe-barrel tubes of ultraclean medical-grade
polypropylene and polyethylene or stainless steel frits.  Packed
within each tube is a surface-modified bonded-silica sorbent.

The sorbent selectively retains specific classes of chemical
compounds within a given matrix.  As an example, the Bond Elut
strong cation exchanger (SCX) can be used to retain the cationic
drug, amphetamine, from urine.  The more specific the interaction
between the sorbent and the analyte, the cleaner the final extract.

Bonded silica sorbents are in many ways the ideal materials for
chromatographic isolation.  This attribute comes primarily from the
number of different functional groups that can be readily bonded to
the silica surface.  Bonded silicas are rigid supports that do not
shrink or swell and form a clean, non-leachable substrate upon
which the bonded functional groups are attached. They also are
stable in a wide range of aqueous and organic solvent conditions
and possess very large surface areas due to their porosity.

Solid-phase extraction works via three general extraction
mechanisms:  Non-polar, polar, and ion exchange.  Each sorbent
within a given extraction mechanism exhibits unique properties of
retention and selectivity that may be quite specific for a given
analyte.  So even in an extraction calls for a non-polar extraction
mechanism, it may be necessary to test several sorbents within a
given category to find the optimal balance between high recovery
and good clean-up.

Both C18 and C8 give acceptably high recoveries for non-polar
analytes from an aqueous matrix.  The slightly increased polarity
of C8 may allow many matrix contaminants to pass through the
cartridge unretained.  Otherwise, it would be retained on the more
non-polar C18 sorbent.  The end result would be a cleaner final
extract with the C8 sorbent.

Bond Elut cartridges come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 50 mg
to 10 g of sorbent.  Smaller cartridges are useful when a sample
size is very small or when the ability to elute the analyte in a
very small volume is needed for maximum concentration.  For sample
or rinse volumes greater than the volume of the standard Bond Elut
cartridge, Varian recommends its Bond Elut LRC configuration as an
alternative.

The flared shape of this cartridge allows users to pour up to 10 ml
in it, without having to use additional adapters or reservoirs.
The wide opening of the Bond Elut LRC also makes alignment and
sample introduction easy for automated sample-processing robots.
The cartridge's tubes have a sturdy, double-ridged lip that
provides a consistent seal for reliable performance when used with
these robotic work stations.

The Bondesil sorbents and sorbent-bed geometry of Bond Elut LRC
cartridges are the same as the standard straight-barreled Bond Elut
cartridges. This means that any method used on a standard cartridge
may be immediately transferred to a Bond Elut LRC with little or no
modification.

Maximum retention capacity for polar and non-polar sorbents is
approximately 5% of the sorbent mass (i.e. 5 mg for a 100 mg
sorbent bed).  However, this value must take into account
additional compounds present in the sample matrix that are also
retained by the sorbent.  Thus, for the compound users wish to
extract, the effective capacity may be much less.  Varian
recommends testing the cartridge capacity for each specific
application.

Larger sorbent amounts provide greater capacity (the amount of
compound that can be retained on the column).  Larger sorbent
masses also require more solvent to elute the compound from the
column.  Consequently, the analyte may be more dilute than if a
smaller sorbent bed was used.

Minimum elution volume for a cartridge is defined as two bed
volumes of elution solution.  Bed volume is 120 l per 100 mg of
sorbent.  In some cases, less than two bed volumes can be used.
Such extractions are often very sensitive to flow rates and other
variables and are not recommended because irreproducible results
may be generated.

Information on Varian's extensive sorbent cartridge line is
available from Nigel Simpson, their Product Manager.

Reduction of Food
Radiostrontium

Radiostrontium contaminates foods and, once digested, accumulates
in the skeleton, where it is difficult to withdraw.  Scientists are
seeking ways of preventing the consumption of radiostrontium in
foodstuffs via the use of various adsorbents (mainly zeolites and
mixed oxides of titanium, silica, or manganese). This isn't a large
problem in the U.S., but is in much of the former USSR.

Results obtained by A.M Puziy (Institute for Sorption and Problems
of Endoecology, Palladin prospect 32/34, 252142 Kiev, Ukraine), G.
Bengtsson [MATFORSK (Norwegian Food Research Institute), Osloveien
1, N-1430 s, Norway], and H.S. Hansen (Dept. of Animal Science,
Agricultural University of Norway, 1432 s, Norway), indicate that
the use of adsorptive materials may be regarded as promising for
reducing foodstuff radioactivity.  The results come after testing
of strontium binding by various sorbents in a number of different
water solutions.

The researchers have found that strontium adsorption from all
studied solutions depends upon pH, with a rise in pH resulting in
steady adsorption increases for the titanium-silicate and the
titanium-manganese sorbents, in particular.  Adsorption on zeolites
remains almost constant.  The existence of either weakly or
strongly acidic groups explain these phenomena. All of the
adsorbents exhibit high selectivities for tracer strontium in 0.1
M of sodium chloride above a pH level of 6. However, in an
artificial flood fluid (AFF), the zeolites (P and A4) exhibit
higher selectivities than the mixed oxides above a pH level of 3.

The research team have ascertained that the strontium binding in
AFF fits well to a model of non-ideal competitive adsorption of 1:1
stoichiometry.  The kinetics of AFF follow a biphasic manner with
a rapid initial phase for all adsorbents. The second slow phase
reveals a decrease for the zeolites and an increase for the mixed
oxides.

For reducing radiostrontium in liquid foodstuffs,  granular forms
(titanium-silicate bound to activated carbon or titanium-manganese)
for continuous flow through deep beds are recommended.  For batch
applications, they suggest powder forms of titanium-silicate or
zeolites.  They caution that the toxicity of these promising
strontium adsorbents warrants more detailed investigation,
especially in the area of the relatively high release of aluminum
and silicon in AFF.

Better Flow Rates
in Extraction Disks

The Empore Extraction Disks, a hybrid membrane technology from
Varian Preparation Products (24201 Frampton Ave., Harbor City, CA
90710; Tel: 310/539-6490, Fax: 310/539-4270), are designed to
provide high sample flow rates.  Better flow rates are valuable for
environmental liquid/solid extraction procedures that require
extraction of large sample volumes.  Formulated for maximum flow
through the membrane, the disks effectively adsorb organic analytes
form aqueous samples and avoid many of the drawbacks associated
with liquid/liquid extraction, such as emulsion formation, labor
intensiveness, delicate expensive glassware, and excessive solvent
usage.

Based on a combination of 3M's Teflon processing technology and
Varian SPP's sorbents, the Empore Disk cartridge consists of a
membrane that contains either embedded polymeric or silica-based
sorbent particles.  The particles are tightly bound in and
individually suspended in a web of inter-micro PTFE fibrils. This
leaves the surface of each particle free for maximum interaction
with the sample during separation.  The result is a very high
efficiency SPE device with superior purity and outstanding flow
characteristics.

Since the sorbent is held in place by the inert PTFE matrix, the
Empore disk is compatible with virtually all organic and inorganic
solvents.  The physical and chemical properties of the Empore
disks, with their silica-based Bondesil sorbents and a new expanded
range of HPLC-grade polymeric sorbents, present practically
unlimited possibilities for the separation scientists.

Empore disks are available in a number of bonded phases.  Disks are
available in three diameters: 25, 47, and 90 mm.  By increasing the
diameter of the disk used, the disk surface area available for
sample passage increases dramatically, resulting in better solvent
flow rates through the disk.

For more information on Empore Extraction disks, contact Nigel
Simpson, product manager, or customer service (Tel: 800/421-2825).

Thin-Film Zeolite
Readied for Market

Zeolite membranes can  separate nitrogen from natural gas deposits
and remove hydrogen from hydrocarbons, such as benzene or methane.
They have proven effective in removing noxious chemicals (i.e.
carbon tetrachloride) from pollution sources. Research, especially
on the academic level, is underway that could yield commercial
benefits.

Researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder (Boulder, CO
80309-0009; Tel: 303/492-6100, Fax: 303/492-5894) have developed a
thin-film zeolite membrane.  The new membrane can withstand high
temperatures and harsh (chemical) environments.

The technology for the membrane involves growing ultrathin layers
of zeolite crystals on the interior walls of small ceramic and
stainless steel tubes. Formation of the membranes occurs with
placement of a zeolite-forming gel inside the small tubes.  After
each end is capped, the gel is heated to a temperature until
crystals form around microscopic octagonal pores.

The resultant zeolite crystals contain very small uniform-sized
pores about the size of a small molecule. This uniformity and small
pore size allows smaller gas and vapor molecules to pass through
the zeolite membrane and rejects larger molecules.  The researchers
are extending their technology through a project for designing
zeolite membranes for use in environmental sensing devices that
will detect minute quantities of pollutants.

RO Separation with
Clay Investigated

Building upon the knowledge that pure clay membranes reject ionic
solutes and desiring to broaden the scope of membrane separation
technology beyond salt rejection, scientists from Japan and Canada
have investigated the solute separation characteristics of
montmorillonite membranes in reverse osmosis.  Investigators
include T. Matsuura (Dept. of Chemical Engineering), C. Detellier
(Dept. of Chemistry) of the Industrial Membrane Research Institute
(University of Ottawa, 161 Louis-Pasteur, P.O. Box 450, Ottawa, K1N
6N5, Ontario, Canada), and M. Ishiguro of the National Research
Institute of Agricultural Engineering (2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba,
Ibaraki 305, Japan).

In the Journal of Membrane Science (107, 87-92, 1995), the
scientists draw the following conclusions from their experimental
data:

  A montmorillonite layer works well as a reverse-osmosis membrane
in rejecting electrolyte solutions;
  The montmorillonite membranes exhibit similar characteristics to
charged membranes;
  The montmorillonite membranes exhibit lower separation of non-
ionized organic solutes than polymeric membranes; and
  The separation of amino acids with the montmorillonite membrane
depends upon the net charge of the amino acid.

The scientists base these conclusions on experiments with Smectites
that come in two-dimensional arrays of silicon-oxygen tetrahedra
and aluminum or magnesium oxygen-hydroxyl octahedral. The clay (in
the form of a paste) is coated on (until all of the paste is
transferred into the cell) and sandwiched between two millipore
filters of 0.1 m pore diameter.  The filters are placed on a
porous stainless steel surface.  The scientists advise placing a
filter paper between the millipore filter and the porous stainless
steel.  Doing so minimizes potential damage when applying high
pressures of various non-ionized organic solutes.
