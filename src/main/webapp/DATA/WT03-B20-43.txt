<H2>Chapter 6: Reinvent Environmental Protection</H2>
<HR><P>
Energy production and use pose significant environmental challenges. Policy approaches must align energy and environmental issues to ensure that economic growth and environmental protection are achieved together. The Administration is reinventing environmental protection, creating regulatory systems that are more flexible and accountable, emphasizing pollution prevention over "end-of-pipe" cleanup, and fostering the development of new energy-efficient technologies to meet both economic and environmental goals. <BR>

<P>

Over the past two decades, energy policy and environmental policy evolved along essentially separate tracks, but growing recognition of the links between energy use and environmental impact has prompted a convergence of energy and environmental policy in the past several years. For example, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have exerted a profound influence on electric utilities and transportation fuels, while the Energy Policy Act of 1992 emphasized the environmental benefits of increasing energy efficiency and expanding the use of renewable energy.<BR>

<P>

The Administration has accelerated this integration of energy and environmental policy because of the potential economic, environmental, and national security benefits that can flow from adopting a more systemic perspective. The ultimate goal is to create a 21st century America in which economic incentives, environmental objectives, and technological innovation are aligned so that economic growth improves-rather than diminishes-environmental quality.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="6.1">Environmental Protection: Challenges and Opportunities for Reform</H4></a>

Much of the present environmental protection system still relies on the command-and-control approach that has evolved over two decades. This approach has resulted in tremendous improvements in air and water quality, but at increasingly high costs as the era of "end-of-pipe" controls begins to yield diminishing economic returns for many key pollutants. This does not mean that such controls are unimportant or cannot be cost-effective. However, there is a recognition that additional environmental protection can often be obtained far more cheaply by examining pollution-creating processes and activities for abatement opportunities and by focusing on preventing pollution rather than on cleaning it up.<BR>

<P>

The current regulatory system sometimes undermines energy policy goals. For example, environmental regulations sometimes require technologies that increase operating energy demands while disregarding the environmental implications of the extra power generated to run the equipment. Or the regulations may simply shift pollution from one medium to another, necessitating additional cleanup. Efficient energy technologies are sometimes discriminated against under environmental regulations, even though they reduce energy use and waste.<BR>

<P>

New technologies offer the best prospects for simultaneous environmental and economic gains-but markets and regulatory systems need to encourage their development and adoption. The specificity and rigidity of many of our Nation's environmental statutes and regulations have blocked the adoption of more creative environmental solutions, have driven up compliance costs unnecessarily, and have stifled innovation in technologies and practices. The Administration recognizes the need to move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and to engage industry in deciding how to most efficiently and flexibly reach environmental goals.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="6.2">A New Approach to Environmental and Energy Policy</H4></a>

The Administration supports an innovative slate of policies to further environmental and energy goals, including reinventing the regulatory system, encouraging cost-effective pollution prevention, and fostering the development of new energy-efficient technologies. The principles at the heart of the Administration's approach to environmental protection are common sense, cost-effectiveness, and a firm commitment to strong environmental goals combined with flexibility in how we reach those goals. The three components of the Administration approach are the following:<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>Reinvent the regulatory system to increase flexibility and adopt performance-based approaches to augment or replace command-and-control measures. Additional flexibility can improve environmental performance and cut costs to industry. This must require new accountability mechanisms to ensure that goals are attained.

<BR>

<P>

<li>Encourage cost-effective pollution prevention through partnerships with industry that identify innovative methods for improving environmental performance and provide incentives for pursuing new approaches. An array of voluntary programs that encourage energy efficiency, renewable energy resources, emissions offsets, and other investments has gained enthusiastic industry support and is producing demonstrable benefits in cost-effective pollution reduction.<BR>

<P>

<li>Foster the development of technologies that will increase environmental protection as well as provide U.S. industry with new technologies for export into the global market. Because flexible approaches to pollution prevention tend to blur the traditional distinctions between environmental and energy technologies, Federal research and development programs and partnerships focus heavily on technologies that simultaneously increase productivity, reduce pollution or waste, and cut energy use.</ul>

<H4><a name="6.3">Reinventing Environmental Regulation</H4></a>

Administration policy increases the flexibility with which we achieve our environmental objectives, without sacrificing accountability or environmental quality. The Reinventing Environmental Regulation initiative announced by President Clinton in March 1995 outlined a new approach to regulatory action, one that recognizes that pollution is often a sign of economic waste and that focuses efforts on<a name="cospoll"></a>cost-effective pollution prevention. Regulations that provide flexibility-but require accountability-can provide greater protection at a lower cost. The initiative also emphasizes collaborative processes over adversarial ones for decisionmaking and compliance. <BR>

<P>

The initiative includes 25 high-priority actions directed both at improving the regulatory system and at generating the building blocks for the regulatory system of the future. These actions, which are being applied across many industries, will have a direct impact on energy production and use and will result in more competitive industries and lower energy costs.<BR>

<P>

Improvements in the Current System. The Administration is undertaking a number of initiatives to make the present regulatory system more flexible and effective. Efforts such as increased open-market air-emissions trading and one-stop emission reports can reduce industry costs while maintaining existing levels of environmental compliance.<BR>

<P>

Reexamining existing regulations to maximize environmental quality while eliminating excessive burdens on industry has led the Administration to refocus the implementation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act on high-risk wastes, to consolidate Federal air-quality rules, and to pursue regulatory negotiation and consensus-based rulemaking. In addition, priorities for enforcement of regulations will now be based on risk. <BR>

<P>

These actions will directly affect the energy-related industries by decreasing costs and making environmental compliance simpler through increased flexibility. At the same time, environmental quality will be ensured and efforts will be focused on the highest areas of risk.<BR>

<P>

Building Blocks for a New System. Setting performance standards and allowing the regulated community to find the best way to meet those standards can get results more cheaply, quickly, and cleanly than mandating design standards or specific technologies. This promotes both lower cost environmental protection and innovation in pollution prevention and control technology. Performance standards can also reward energy-efficiency investments that also reduce pollution. Accountability and responsibility must accompany this increased flexibility to ensure that our Nation's environmental goals are being met.<BR>

<P>

Where environmental and economic goals can be best reconciled by giving maximum flexibility to industry, the most flexible tool is the concept of performance agreements between business and regulators. The Environmental Protection Agency has developed a coordinated series of demonstration projects designed to provide facilities, industrial sectors, communities, and Federal agencies with opportunities to implement alternative management strategies.<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>Project XL. Through Project XL (Excellence and Leadership), the Federal Government, working in cooperation with States and selected firms, will test a new approach to environmental management. The goal of this initiative is to improve the environmental performance of U.S. industries by providing the option of following an alternative path to existing regulatory-driven compliance. The pilot program will require reductions in discharges below current regulatory standards in exchange for greater flexibility in achieving environmental objectives.</ul>

 

The key elements of this initiative are performance, flexibility, accountability, and partnerships. The components of the process are: (1) an environmental review of the facility; (2) development of an alternative strategy to achieve emissions reductions beyond current standards; (3) community involvement throughout the strategic planning and goal-setting process; (4) Environmental Protection Agency approval, whereupon the plan replaces many existing regulatory requirements; (5) establishment of alternative monitoring and reporting mechanisms to allow auditing and regular public reporting of the facility's environmental performance.<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>Alternative strategies for sectors. Through the use of industry covenants and other enforceable agreements, the Environmental Protection Agency and several industries will demonstrate how adjustments and modifications in environmental regulatory requirements can achieve more cost-effective environmental results. The industries involved in the Common Sense Initiative will provide the first opportunities to test this approach. Coordination with petroleum refiners through this initiative to reduce the cost of compliance and increase productivity assists the industry, ensures environmental quality, and helps keep energy prices affordable.</ul>

 

In addition to performance-based standards, the Administration is examining new tools for both government and industry to use in implementing new environmental management systems. Tools such as third-party audits for industry compliance and multimedia permitting will streamline compliance procedures.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="6.4">Encouraging Pollution Prevention in the Energy Sector</H4></a>

The Administration is exploring ways that the Federal Government can work with industry and market forces to encourage environmental improvement while stimulating markets. In some areas, market forces can simultaneously contribute to environmental protection, increased productivity, and continuous improvement in technologies and practices.<BR>

<P>

Cost-effective energy-efficiency investments, for example, can save money, reduce pollution, and reduce the need for expensive additional pollution controls. Likewise, some renewable energy sources can displace the need for fossil fuels that have greater environmental impact.<BR>

<P>

Unfortunately, markets often do not sufficiently encourage these investments, primarily because of two factors. First, the market price of energy does not always reflect the full costs of use, including environmental impacts, which leads to underuse of efficient technologies. Second, information on the latest technologies is not always readily available, preventing market participants from making the best decisions.<BR>

<P>

Where markets do not fully recognize the environmental benefits of increased energy efficiency, voluntary programs can help create incentives for technology development, stimulate energy-efficiency investments, and disseminate information. Voluntary programs have emerged as a key tool in addressing environmental problems without statutory mandates. For example, carbon dioxide is the dominant greenhouse gas, but is not currently subject to regulatory requirements. The Administration has pioneered a voluntary market approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. <BR>

<P>

Climate Change Action Plan.  Climate change raises complex environmental and energy issues. It also offers an opportunity for new approaches, because few Federal regulations limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Change Action Plan initiated a host of voluntary programs, including Climate Challenge and Climate Wise, that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost productivity and profits.<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>Climate Challenge. Under this voluntary program, which was developed jointly by the Department of Energy and the electric utility industry, utilities agree to reduce, avoid, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions using flexible individualized plans to achieve the reductions in the most cost-effective way. The program recognizes that utilities are in the best position to determine how to reduce emissions cost-effectively in their own systems. To date, 450 utilities have joined the Climate Challenge program, pledging to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. <BR>

<P>

<li>Climate Wise. Climate Wise, which is being carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, is designed to stimulate industrial emission reductions. Industrial companies representing almost 4 percent of U.S. industrial energy use have become partners in Climate Wise and have pledged to reduce emissions significantly over the next several years.</ul>

 

Information programs also play a key role in encouraging the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under the authority contained in Section 1605 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Department of Energy has issued guidelines for anyone, including participants in Climate Challenge, Climate Wise, and other voluntary programs, to record the results of emission-reduction actions. This mechanism allows industry partners to demonstrate that they have attained the performance goals to which they have agreed, and it provides a way for any business or organization to record the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and consider efforts to reduce emissions.<BR>

<P>

Environmental benefits are also realized through other Administration programs to enhance efficiency and increase productivity while reducing environmental impacts. Examples of voluntary programs established by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are the Motor Challenge and Green Lights programs <a href="ch3a.html">(see Chapter 3)</a>, which increase energy efficiency while decreasing the environmental impacts of excess energy use.<BR>

<P>

The Climate Change Action Plan was constructed to meet the U.S. goal of returning net greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, using economic growth, energy price, and Federal budget assumptions based on 1993 projections. Because these projections have shifted, and since the Plan relies heavily on the performance of voluntary programs whose outcomes are subject to market uncertainty, the Administration will conduct an assessment of the Plan's progress in the fall of 1995.<BR>

<P>

Clean Cities Program. An example of partnerships at the community level is the Clean Cities program. This program leverages the Federal purchase of alternative-fuel vehicles into a coordinated effort to overcome infrastructure barriers for alternative-fuel vehicles while assisting local governments with environmental mandates. In this voluntary program, cities that are not in compliance with the Clean Air Act are encouraged to partner with the Federal Government to establish fleets of alternative-fuel vehicles. While this program was designed to provide the market pull for private-sector infrastructure investment in alternative fuels <a href=ch3a.html>(see Chapter 3)</a>, it is targeted to assist cities that are working to comply with Federal air pollution standards. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="6.5">Fostering Technology Development</H4></a>

The Administration supports research and development on energy technologies that improve environmental performance, and assists in commercializing these technologies to help industry increase competitiveness and decrease pollution. An environmental technology strategy that helps industry shift from waste management toward pollution prevention, more efficient resource use, and industrial ecology models will increase long-term economic growth and improve and sustain the environment. The Administration's environmental technology strategy helps companies become more competitive by lowering their energy and resource needs while reducing or eliminating their waste cleanup or disposal costs. Nationally, the strategy will spur economic growth by capturing the rapidly growing market for clean technologies and shifting money from consumption of resources to investment in new plants and equipment. Globally, it will help developing countries to use sustainable technologies in many industrial and service sectors more rapidly.<BR>

<P>

As energy and environmental policies converge, technology is one clear bridge between the two. A wide array of technologies can improve environmental performance, not just conventional pollution-abatement technology. Technologies that increase the efficiency of energy use or minimize waste in energy production invariably reduce the environmental impacts associated with those activities. These include technologies that increase energy efficiency, reduce materials consumption, improve product quality and durability, and provide substitutes for energy-intensive products and processes. Where market forces are slow to stimulate these developments, the Administration has embarked upon a <a name="nets"></a>National Environmental Technology Strategy to accelerate the adoption of environmentally superior technology. <BR>

<P>

The National Environmental Technology Strategy outlined in Bridge to a Sustainable Future is a set of policies and programs that will establish a new course for the development and use of environmental technologies into the next century. The strategy expands the environmental tool kit, replacing those instruments that are no longer effective with a new set of tools designed to meet today's challenges and tomorrow's needs.</BODY><HR>
