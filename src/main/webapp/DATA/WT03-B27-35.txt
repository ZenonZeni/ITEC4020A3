The adventure begins as we head for Elgin by way of hill (one very long and big hill) and very few dales. Our first stop is Spout Springs, a skiing wonderland in winter and mountain bike haven in summer. On the way UP to this scenic spot, take a moment a look around (it's much too easy to keep your focus down when you're traveling skyward) and especially back towards Athena. The transition from rolling wheat country to the Blue Mountains is truly spectacular. At the top, the reward is two-fold: a delicious lunch followed by a wonderful downhill cruise to Elgin.
<p>
Elgin, named after the song, "Lost on the Lady Elgin" is a thriving community of 1,775 surrounded by nature at its finest. With the Wallowa Mountains to the east and the Blue Mountains to the west, the town site was once the location of the Central Indian Camp for the Nez Perce tribe, the former location of Fort Baker and a trading area since the 1880s. It's fortunate the days mileage is short, for the community is long on entertainment. You'll be treated to everything from a cowboy ballet and western dancing to a tuba band and three-act play.
