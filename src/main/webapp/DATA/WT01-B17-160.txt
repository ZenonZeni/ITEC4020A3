<i><b>Examining a live sample of your blood can reveal whether you're prone to a heart attack—and show you how to prevent it from ever happening.<br></b></i>
     <b>By James R. Privitera, M.D.</b>
<p>

Suppose you think you’re prone to a heart attack or have health factors suggesting the possibility of one, there is a simple, inexpensive way to “ask” your body if conditions exist to make a heart attack possible. Even better, once you know your level of risk, it’s easy to take preventive steps, using nutrition, to keep it from ever happening.<p>
    The simple, inexpensive technique is called darkfield live blood microscopy. We draw a drop of your blood from your fingertip and place it on a microscope slide. Then a special lens inside the microscope projects an intimate view of your living blood onto a television or computer screen by way of a video camera. A Polaroid camera is hooked up to the device enabling us to take photographs of a patient’s blood condition before and after treatment. The result is a living picture of the cellular you.<p>

<b>WHAT SILENT CLOTS CAN DO WITHOUT WARNING </b><p>
The advantage of using a darkfield microscope instead of the more conventional brightfield is that we can see much more detail, such as the contours and shapes of red blood cells and platelets. In a cubic centimeter of blood from a healthy individual, there are usually close to 300,000 platelets, which are disc-shaped elements essential for blood clotting. <p>
In most cases, clotting is good because it stops uncontrolled bleeding; but if excess clotting happens in a blood vessel, it can cause a heart attack. When platelets start aggregating and sticking together in the blood, they form a clot, which can block the flow of blood through that vessel. Then, if the platelet aggregation is 3-4 times larger than a red blood cell (which is often the case), it will block the movement of the red blood cells through a capillary (which is a tiny, tributary blood vessel) and block them from releasing oxygen to the tissues. This means you will have a lower oxygen concentration in your blood, a clinical condition called ischemia (iss-KEY-mee-uh). <p>
The biggest problem about blood clotting inside your blood vessels is that you probably will have no idea it’s happening. When patients come to the office with chest pains (a strong indication of risk), I immediately have a look at their blood. But about 80% of heart attacks are painless, which means the ischemia due to blood clotting produces no pain or gasping and therefore gives you no warning. <p>
You may be driving the car and suddenly slump over the wheel with a silent heart attack. This frightening event may be prevented through a darkfield examination of your blood, followed by a precise nutritional prescription to reduce platelet aggregation. In the darkfield blood pictures [see left], the platelet cluster looks like a blob of oatmeal poured onto a black surface. This is what blood clotting looks like, and it’s also the face of a condition that could produce a heart attack. <p>

<b>HOW CARLON AVOIDED A TRIPLE BYPASS SURGERY</b><p>
Carlon, aged 62, came to me with high blood pressure (170/70), chest pains, and a 5-year history of serious heart problems, including a moderate heart attack. He had undergone numerous mainstream treatments, which hadn’t helped him, and now his conventional physician was urging him to have triple-bypass surgery. <p>
“A total of 14 doctors of the highest degree told me I couldn’t live without this surgery, that it was imperative,” Carlon reported. “They all agreed that this was the “only” way they had to keep me alive.” They told him if he didn’t have the surgery in 2 weeks or less, he would probably die.<p>
Carlon didn’t buy this pessimistic forecast and refused the surgery. He came to me for help. “I believe God built a cage over my heart for a reason. It doesn’t need to be messed up with a knife,” said Carlon.<p>
I performed a comprehensive mineral analysis from a sample of Carlon’s hair, and a darkfield examination of his blood. He was seriously low in selenium, magnesium, zinc, chromium, and manganese, and he had some large clots which, incidentally, are associated with a magnesium deficiency. My treatment program for Carlon had 2 major aspects: chelation therapy and a nutritional prescription.<p>
First, Carlon started having intravenous chelation twice weekly to improve his circulation and remove heavy metals from his system. Chelation therapy is a clinically proven method of binding up (“chelating”) and draining toxins and metabolic wastes from the body while at the same time increasing blood flow and removing arterial plaque. In chelation, a nontoxic substance called EDTA is intravenously infused over a 3-1/2 hour period; usually 20-30 treatments are recommended at the rate of 1-3 sessions per week.<p>
Second, I developed a nutritional supplementation formula for Carlon to help thin his blood and dissolve the clots. Although the nutrients and dosages must be adjusted to the conditions of individual patients, the list [see table] will give the reader a practical idea of how a nutrient program can help prevent heart attacks.<p>
It only took Carlon only 3 months of chelation and supplementation for his chest pains to disappear. Even better, at that point he was able to ride his bicycle 25 miles a day with no discomfort. That was 5 years ago. He bypassed the bypass and is doing well. <p>
Carlon follows a reduced dosage maintenance plan for supplements and has chelation about once monthly. “I have skipped the scalpel 5 times in my life,” Carlon told me recently. “I thank God I was stubborn enough to choose my own doctors.” <p>
