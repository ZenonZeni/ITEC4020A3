<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEA Herbicide Under Fire From
Hawaii Residents</b></font><b><br>
Locals Complain Of Nausea, Other Ailments Due To Spraying</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 17, 1996, Hawaii Island, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp;
Residents of Hawaii's Big Island are complaining of nausea,
headaches, and fatigue and some are pointing fingers at the
federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For nearly a decade, Drug Enforcement Agency-coordinated
marijuana eradication efforts have targeted Hawaii Island, often
spraying a glyphosate-based herbicide from low-flying helicopters over
suspected marijuana patches.&nbsp; Recently, however, some
residents are claiming that the pesticide, a chemical weed-killer
similar to &quot;Round Up,&quot; is killing wildlife and making
some citizens sick. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;You can actually taste it in your mouth,&quot; said Roger
Christie of the Hawaii Hemp Council, who alleges that diesel fuel
is occasionally mixed with the pesticide.&nbsp; Christie claims
that gusts of wind disperse the pesticide to outlying
communities, where it collects in rainwater catchments.&nbsp;
Rooftop catchments are a common source of residents' drinking
water. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In the last two weeks, hundreds of people have come to me
with their complaints and said that's why I'm feeling this way
too,&quot; said Ka'u resident Susan Smith in an interview with KGMB-TV
earlier this month.&nbsp; &quot;[Law enforcement] are flying over
my house every other day.&nbsp; ... It's like a war zone out
here.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to our
bio-diversity,&quot; said Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLaw
Institute Inc., an Oklahoma organization that works to strengthen
environmental laws.&nbsp; Berry cited a 1995 <i>Journal of
Pesticide Reform</i> report that said glyphosate exposure was the third
most commonly reported pesticide illness among agricultural
workers in California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DEA spokesman Sidney Hayakawa acknowledged the residents' concern
and noted that the spraying procedure is currently under
evaluation.&nbsp; He told KGMB-TV that the agency will issue an updated
Environmental Impact Statement next year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lenny Terlip of the state Department of Land and Natural
Resources (DLNR) told <b>NORML</b> that claims of glyphosate
harming the environment and endangering the health of residents
were &quot;erroneous.&quot;&nbsp; He denied reports that the
herbicide was mixed with any additives and said that the sprayings
were not being conducted near houses or residential areas.&nbsp;
The helicopter-mounted spray-guns have &quot;pin-point
accuracy,&quot; he added. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For now, however, the battle rages on and many residents remain
unconvinced.&nbsp; This is an example of &quot;law enforcement
run amuck,&quot; claimed environmental activist and resident
Jerry Rothstein, who recently attended a town meeting where
numerous residents complained of health complications such as eye
irritation, itchy throats, and bronchial problems due to
spraying.&nbsp; Photographs on display at the meeting documented
orange-sprayed foliage in forests and yards as well as dead bird
carcasses.&nbsp; &quot;From the response of the Ka'u community,
th[ese] latest aerial herbicide attack[s] appear to be among the
worst yet,&quot; noted Rothstein. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Why do we have to wait [until] five years from now [for an
answer?]&quot; asked Smith.&nbsp; &quot;Why do we have to wait
... till they tell us, okay, it's toxic and now it's
outlawed?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, only one other state, South Dakota, engages in aerial
herbicide spraying. <br>

the Hawaii Hemp Council @ (808) 961-0488 or Jerry Rothstein @

<p align="center"><b>Drug Tax Ruled Unconstitutional By Texas
Appeals Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 16, 1996, Austin, TX:</b>&nbsp; A
state law meant to penalize drug dealers by making them pay taxes
on confiscated drugs violates constitutional guarantees against
double jeopardy, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled
Wednesday.&nbsp; The decision is similar to a 1995 Arizona ruling
that prohibited an individual who possessed marijuana from
criminal prosecution &quot;because the tax imposed prior to the
prosecution served a punitive purpose.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lawyers involved in the case said the 5-4 decision means the
state can either impose a drug tax or prosecute an individual for
illegal activity; it can't do both.&nbsp; &quot;This [ruling]
means the state only gets one chance to punish you,&quot; said
Tom Moran, a Houston attorney representing the defendant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision could lead to the review of nearly 1,000 of drug
cases in which both criminal penalties and taxes were
assessed.&nbsp; In cases which all or some of the state drug tax
has been paid, this ruling could be &quot;a pretty good
get-out-of-jail-free card,&quot; said Dan McCrory, an assistant district
attorney for Harris County.&nbsp; A spokesman for the state
comptroller's office told the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> that
counties had referred over 9,000 cases to their offices for
collection of the drug tax. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the recent decision, the court found that Texas' $98 tax on an
ounce of marijuana and $200 per gram of controlled substance was
so high as to conclude, &quot;it ... is a penalty for criminal conduct.&quot;&nbsp;
Therefore, the court ruled that because the defendant had already
been punished by &quot;imposition and partial collection of a
tax,&quot; further prosecution would violate his Fifth Amendment protections
against double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The case had initially been denied by Texas courts, but the U.S.
Supreme Court ordered the state courts to reconsider based upon a
1994 Supreme Court ruling on double jeopardy.&nbsp; In that case, <i>Department
of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that to
collect a tax on the possession of drugs from defendants who had
already been charged, convicted, and sentenced on criminal
charges involving the same drugs was the functional equivalent of
a successive criminal prosecution. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Enforcement Administration Attacks
California Medical Marijuana Measure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Drug Enforcement Administration has come out against a
California ballot initiative (Proposition 215) to prevent the
state prosecution of patients who use marijuana for a documented
medical need. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a press release issued by Thomas Constantine, chief
administrator, the agency states that it is &quot;firmly
opposed&quot; to the proposal.&nbsp; The agency cites rising
adolescent drug use and an alleged lack of evidence regarding
marijuana's therapeutic value as reasons for holding its
position. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;How can we tell American children to refuse to use illegal
drugs when medical practitioners are prescribing marijuana as
casually as they prescribe penicillin or cough syrup?&quot; he
asked.&nbsp; &quot;The children of America deserve to live a
drug-free life, safe from the effects of drugs, and safe from the
crime and degradation that drug-taking breeds.&nbsp; Proposition
215 sends the unequivocal message that we have surrendered to the
legalizers and have relinquished our principles.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This initiative is not about sending messages to kids, it's
about reality,&quot; said Dave Fratello of Californians for
Medical Rights.&nbsp; &quot;The reality is that marijuana is
helpful as a medicine.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Marijuana has a 5,000 year medical history and was declared
to be 'one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
to man' in 1988 by the DEA's own Chief Administrative Law
Judge,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana's medical utility has been endorsed
by such well respected organizations as the American Public
Health Association, National Academy of Sciences, and Federation
of American Scientists.&nbsp; For the DEA to claim otherwise is
fallacious.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 215 is currently endorsed by the San Francisco
Academy of Family Physicians, San Francisco Medical Society,
California Nurses Association, and others.&nbsp; It continues to
have strong voter support and leads by 33 percent, according to
an October 15 Field Poll. <br>

Californians for Medical Rights @ (310) 451-2522 or Allen St.
