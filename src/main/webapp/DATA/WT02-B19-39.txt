<BLOCKQUOTE>The Lindora Lean For Life program is helping people just like you achieve healthier lives through responsible weight management.<P>
Our program is far more than a "diet." Lindora offers a comprehensive medical solution to weight control.  Our program is created to address your individual physiological and psychological needs through a unique, three-phase approach.<p>
<B>Weight Loss-</B> During this phase, one-on-one daily visits provide you with counseling and medically-based solutions to make dietary compliance more comfortable. You will lose fat by employing your body's natural ketogenic energy system, which allows you to tolerate a low calorie diet while burning stored fat for energy.  You lose weight safely while protecting esssential lean muscle tissue.<p>

<b>Metabolic Adjustment-</B> At Lindora, we understand that losing the weight is only the first step.  For lasting success, you must learn to keep it off.  Upon reaching your lean weight goal, or after any weight loss phase, it's essential to carefully and gradually increase your food intake.  This metabolic adjustment phase is structured to help you reset your "appestat" so you retain the results you've achieved during the weight loss phase.<p>

<B>Long Term Maintenance- </B>Having achieved your "Lean for Life" goal, this lifetime phase of the program is essential to your lasting success.  During long term maintenance, you will experience a physiological change when you reset your appestat center.  We emphasize the importance of low-fat food choices, exercise, relaxation, and other stress control techniques and coping strategies which empower patients to stop using food as a "tranquilizer."
