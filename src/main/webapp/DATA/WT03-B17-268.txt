<PRE>
 <B> For Immediate Relief:</B>
 If you are having a severe flea problem
indoors you must first do a through cleanup
of the immediate area(s). The key thing to do here is to vacuum
thoroughly any rugs, send them to the cleaners if you can't do this,
then have a company come and steam clean them.

     You can dust with pure pyrthrium flowers. Use only 100%
      pyrethrium dust. You can alternatively use a mixture of
      DE and Pyrethrium. I suggest that you buy a pound of garden
      grade DE and a 8oz of Pure Pyrethrium dust, blend the
      two together. Handle  with care since it is a dust and you
      should avoid breathing ANY kind of dust. This mixture is safe
      and will not harm you or your animals as they should be dusted
      also before and after you clean your rug.
 Pyrethrium can be purchased from Arbico
