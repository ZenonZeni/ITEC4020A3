<p><b>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding</b> </p>

<p><b>The Technical Papers of the First Report of the National
Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse<br>
March, 1972</b> </p>

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congress created the Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse to
separate fact from fiction, reality from myth, and to achieve a
balanced judgment on the marihuana issue. The first report of the
Commission is an attempt to clarify the essential issues and
concerns of our society regarding marihuana and to extrapolate
our findings and conclusions into a reasonable societal response.
</p>

<p>In an effort to present these complex issues with a maximum of
clarity, comprehension, and readability, the Commission Report
does not include references. This Appendix, however, fully
documents the methodological and substantive, issues presented in
the Report. In addition to the technical data, the Appendix also
contains the historical and philosophical matrix of the Report. </p>

<p>The papers of the Appendix are divided into six major parts.
Part One deals with the biosocial aspects which relate to
marihuana's effect on individuals as well as to the larger
society. </p>

<p>It includes an historical survey of two types of marihuana
use, medicinal and intoxicant, which constitutes a review of
marihuana use in many parts of the world. An analysis of the
accepted sociocultural parameters helps to put the American
marihuana, user into perspective. </p>

<p>Part One also presents detailed and current reviews of the
botanical, psychopharmacologic, physiologic, and behavioral
effects of marihuana on man. </p>

<p>Part Two, the social aspects of marihuana use, discusses
patterns of the individual user as well as the relationship of
marihuana use to violent and non-violent crime. </p>

<p>One of the most controversial issues in the study of marihuana
is its relationship to other drugs. The second chapter of Part
Two deals specifically with this issue and explores, in depth and
with careful consideration, the hypothesis that marihuana use
leads to other drugs, especially heroin. </p>

<p>Part Three is concerned with the legal aspects of the
marihuana controversy. In order to place marihuana, a
psychoactive drug, in proper perspective, a history of the
control of marihuana, alcohol and tobacco is presented. </p>

<p>This section of the Appendix also reviews the current
marihuana laws at the international, federal and state levels
including statutes that require physicians to report drug
addiction. The section concludes with a description of
trafficking and distribution patterns of the drug. </p>

<p>Part Four, the response of the criminal justice system,
analyzes law enforcement behavior with respect to marihuana use.
The relationship between the opinions held by officials in the
criminal justice system and their behavior toward marihuana
offenders is also discussed. </p>

<p>Part Five presents the findings of the Commission-sponsored
National Survey of public attitudes and behavior toward
marihuana, other drug use and related social issues. </p>

<p>Part Six discusses the marihuana issue with respect to
sociolegal policy practices and decisions. Included in the
section is a discussion of the constitutional dimensions which
form the basis for alternative models for the control of
marihuana. A nationwide study of marihuana education presents
policies and programs on a state-by-state basis and includes
descriptions of ongoing marihuana education programs. <br>
</p>

<p>The Appendix concludes with a presentation of future research
recommendations as suggested guidelines for various agencies,
institutions and individuals engaged in research on marihuana. </p>

<p>Each of the papers contained herein represents the composite
effort of the Commission members and staff, consultants,
contractors and youth consultants. </p>

<p>Of necessity, space limitations precluded the publication in
full of many excellent papers; many works are presented either in
abridged form or integrated into the Commission's own
presentation. </p>

<p>A list of all papers submitted to the Commission is presented
at the conclusion of the Appendix. Should any reader wish to
obtain a copy of a particular work, the request should be sent
directly to the author and not to the Commission.<br>
