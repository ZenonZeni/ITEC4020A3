At the turn of the century, West Garfield was a thriving
community on Chicago's West Side, offering jobs, easy
transportation, and a regional park. But today the
median household income of its declining population is
only $15,102, and 40 percent of the neighborhood lots
are vacant.<P>

Things are improving, though. Garfield Park is being 
refurbished, a regional library has opened, and the Lake
Street El Coalition stopped the Chicago Transit
Authority from shutting down the elevated train line
that serves the neighborhood. In 1993, the coalition
advanced an ambitious plan, assembled by the
<STRONG>Center for Neighborhood Technology</STRONG>
(CNT), to use Pulaski Station on the Green Line as the
centerpiece of a pedestrian-friendly, transit-based
redevelopment model designed to boost ridership by
increasing density and encouraging sustainable economic
development.<P>

Specifics of the plan include on-site policing, child
care, retail stores, and business offices at Pulaski
Station, which would become an intermodal hub with a
shuttle to the nearby commercial strip, and with bicycle
lockers, traffic calming, and a pedestrian-oriented
shopping strip. In-filling would provide greater housing
variety, while technical and financial assistance would
help retain manufacturing jobs. Lake Street would be
designated a "green industrial area" to recruit
environmental businesses.<P>

The project should save more than 1,500 vehicle miles
traveled per day. Because the Lake Michigan area has not
attained national air quality standards, the project
qualified for a $4  million capital grant through the
federal transportation act. Because this project will
help clean the air, CNT was able to secure demonstration
funds for similar plans at four other inner-city Green
Line stations.<P>
