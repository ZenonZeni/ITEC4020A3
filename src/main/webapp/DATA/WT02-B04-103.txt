Dear Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy:

We write to express our support for the principles embodied in the Medical
Records Confidentiality Act (S.1360), as revised April 10, 1996.  We 
believe S.1360, in its current form, will provide strong, enforceable privacy
protections for peoples' medical records, while also fostering improved 
quality of care and efficiency in the health care environment.

We appreciate your commitment to this critical issue, as well as your 
willingness to address the need to modify S.1360 since its introduction.

We look forward to continuing to work with you to strengthen and clarify 
the Medical Records Confidentiality Act as it is considered further by 
the Congress.

Sincerely,
