<h2>EDITORIAL -- Vote Yes on Prop. 215 For Medical Marijuana </h2>

<p><font SIZE=+0>ILLEGAL RECREATIONAL marijuana use has been much in the
news lately; especially the widely publicized studies indicating that teenage
pot smoking is up all over the country and is at an all-time high in California.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>We deplore kids using illegal drugs, and urge them to
stay clean. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>But Proposition 215 is not about playing with drugs. It
is a humane and commonsensical measure that would amend state law to allow
sick people and caregivers to grow or possess marijuana only for medical
use and only when recommended by their doctors. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>It would also prevent physicians from being punished for
recommending pot for medical purposes, just as they use other medicines,
including such powerful and useful drugs as morphine, codeine, Valium,
Librium and nitrous oxide, also known as ``laughing gas.'' </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>By any sensible standard, marijuana should be a welcome
addition to the pharmacopoeia of drugs used by California physicians, who
are trusted with all kinds of narcotics, sedatives and psychoactives that
can also be dangerous if improperly used. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Many doctors and patients say smoking marijuana is helpful
in the treatment of such ailments as AIDS, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine
headaches, multiple sclerosis and spasticity. It also relieves the pain
of cancer and nausea associated with chemotherapy, alleviates chronic pain
and helps ward off asthma attacks, according to patients who have used
it. This is not to say that pot is a risk-free substance. Like many medicines,
marijuana has side effects, including the danger of lung disease from inhaling
hot smoke loaded with impurities and chronic impairment of cognitive skills
in heavy pot users. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>However, doctors and their patients would certainly be
capable of weighing the risks against the benefits and decide for themselves
if pot would be appropriate for the ailment to be treated. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>It is a sad commentary on our fatuous drug laws that,
as a practical matter, the only people unable to obtain marijuana are housebound
patients without an illegal drug connection and law-abiding citizens who
prefer to bear the pain and ravages of their illnesses rather than violate
the law. During two of the past three years, the state Legislature has
passed bills that would have allowed sick people to use marijuana as medicine.
But in a victory of puritanical politics over humane medicine, Governor
Wilson vetoed the bills each time. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>If marijuana eases the symptoms of disease and provides
solace to the severely sick -- as so many patients and their doctors insist
-- it should be legal to use as medicine. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Vote yes on Proposition 215. It is a simple matter of
compassion and common sense. </font></p>
