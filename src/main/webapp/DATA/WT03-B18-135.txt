<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PC-Based Robotic Simulation Smashes Price/Performance
Barrier</H1>
<P><B> Fort Myers , FL</B> (November 10, 1995):  A new, sophisticated robotic
simulation software system that runs on a personal computer (PC) has demolished
the barrier that separated simulation economy and performance.</P>
<P>WORKSPACE&#174;, offered by Florida-based Robotic Workspace Technologies
(RWT), Inc., is the world's first PC-based program that creates real-time
simulation of robotic workcells with its own 3D CAD system.  It also provides
effective off-line programming and on-line calibration of individual robots
using seamless software on a single PC or notebook. There are over 700 systems
installed worldwide.</P>
<P>WORKSPACE costs a small fraction - less than 1/3 - of engineering
workstation systems in use today.  A few of the features and cost savings are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>complete 3D simulation of entire workcells on a PC, including notebooks;
</LI>
<LI>direct CAD input (DXF, IGES):</LI>
<LI>off-line programming in the robot's native language without interrupting
robot operation;</LI>
<LI>on-line robot and workcell calibration;</LI>
<LI>new-program development time reduced;</LI>
<LI>design-before-you-build allows costly errors to be corrected before they
become hardware;</LI>
<LI>on-line robot program editing and verification </LI>
</UL>
<P>WORKSPACE saves time, delivers greater accuracy, and is easier to use than
mainframe and engineering workstation systems.  The system's purchase price is
under $28,000.  WORKSPACE may also be rented or leased, an ideal route to
improved productivity today when the budget says wait.</P>
<P> WORKSPACE was developed for the PC platform in the late 1980's by Robot
Simulations, Ltd. (United Kingdom) and is now offered exclusively by Robotic
Workspace Technologies, Inc., 17105 San Carlos Boulevard, Suite A6151, Fort
Myers Beach, Florida, 33931; (941) 466-0488; FAX (941) 466-7270.</P>
