<strong>Completion of IDEA Reauthorization Becomes Problematic <br>
Due to Time Constraints</strong><P>

With each passing day, it is more and more unlikely that reauthorization will be
completed this year.  As this update was completed, the Congress had just recessed
for its annual month-long August break, so nothing more will happen until after Labor
Day.  The Senate failed to give final approval to its version of IDEA reauthorization prior
to this recess.<P>

The Senate is scheduled to reconvene on September 3, and the House a day later. 
With only a few short weeks from Labor Day until the anticipated adjournment of the
104th Congress,  the prospects for completion of the reauthorization of IDEA this year
look grim indeed.<P>

The bill is still being held from Senate floor action by three Senators - Mr. Gorton
(R-WA), Mr. Gregg (R-NH), and Mr. Ashcroft (R-MO).  These members have asked that
a time-limited debate occur on the Senate floor to address their remaining issues which
include:  discipline, attorneys fees, and cost.  The Democrats have rejected the plan to
have a time-limited debate on the Senate floor.  It is generally believed that any such
debate would not result in any improvements to the existing bill. <P>

Regardless, Senate committee and subcommittee staff and members are still
attempting to move the bill along.  In mid-July, Senator Frist (R-TN), chairman of the
Subcommittee on Disability Policy, and Senator Harkin (D-IA), Ranking Democrat on
the subcommittee, asked members of the consensus group that developed the House
IDEA compromise measure to meet to develop a few amendments that could be added
to the current Senate bill that might result in agreement from all sides.  The consensus
group, with representatives from the disability, special education and general education
communities, met several times but no progress was made. <P>

In addition, Senators Frist and Harkin recently have been attempting to negotiate a
"manager's package" to address the remaining areas of disagreement.  No details on
the pieces of this package have been available to the community, which is a cause for
concern at this point.  If agreement is reached by committee members, this package
would be inserted into the bill prior to the floor vote.  The "manager's package" does
offer an opportunity to negotiate remaining issues while avoiding a potentially long and
bitter debate on IDEA on the Senate floor. <P>

As you know, the House bill, H.R. 3268, passed the full House on June 10, 1996.  If
and when  S. 1578 passes the Senate, the conference committee faces a difficult task
of resolving the differences in the two bills to create a final bill that can pass both
houses of Congress before the October 4 projected adjournment.<P>

<strong>Welfare Reform Legislation</strong><P>

In mid-July both houses of Congress passed welfare reform bills that will end this
country's 61-year history of promising support to the impoverished.  President Clinton
signed the compromise bill, saying that it was a good first step, but need some
refinement.  It is estimated that the bill will save $55 billion over six years over the
estimated cost under the current system.   CEC did not support passage of the bill
because of its likely impact upon children and especially upon children of immigrants. 
While giving states wide discretion to develop their own programs, the legislation
requires states to:<P>

<ul><li>limit lifetime welfare to five years<br>
<li>require able adults to work after two years (up to 20% may be exempted)<br>
<li>end food stamps and financial assistance to convicted drug offenders (their families
would still be eligible)<br>
<li>allow Medicaid to be given to families on welfare and for one year after work is
resumed<br>
<li>limit food stamps for childless adults (18-50) to three months every three years
(unless they are working)<br>
<li>prohibit food stamps and Supplemental Security Income to most legal immigrants
who have not become citizens</ul><P>
    
Along with CEC, many groups (i.e., Child Welfare League, Children's Defense Fund,
and Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities) believe this bill will be very detrimental for
children.<P>
  
<ul><li>Many children with serious disabilities will lose Supplemental Security Income
due to changes in eligibility<li>
<li>Children older than 13 who have disabilities and are cut from SSI will lose their
Medicaid support<br>
<li>Most children whose parents lose their welfare will also lose their assistance<br>
<li>An estimated 1.1 million more children will become impoverished as a result of
decreased or lost federal support than under current law. </ul><P>

A House amendment that would have provided vouchers for basic services to children
whose parents had lost their eligibility was defeated. Although he has promised to sign
the bill, the President said that it will push too many children into poverty.  He vowed to
write legislation next year that will provide more protection for both children and legal
immigrants.<P>
 
A House provision that would have required nonprofit organizations (but not for-profits)
to print disclaimers on all advocacy efforts was taken out of the final bill.  This provision
had nothing to do with welfare.  It was once a separate bill that could not pass on its
own and was subsequently attached to this bill.  Its major result would have been an
increase in paperwork and paper use for nonprofit organizations like CEC.<P>

<strong>Health Care Reform</strong><P>

The bill designed to make it easier for people to keep their health insurance when they
switch jobs or lose their job passed both houses of Congress in early August and
President Clinton promised to sign the bill into law.  The general goals and provisions of
the bill received widespread support, but negotiations were very careful on two key
issues:<P>
<ul><li>Medical Savings Accounts (the size and scope of a test of these accounts is
unresolved)<br>
<li>Mental Health Parity (most, if not all, protections in this area were
removed)</ul><P>

The primary goal of this bill is to increase the availability of insurance to people who
lose their jobs, switch jobs, or who have prior medical conditions.  CEC strongly
supported efforts to improve mental health parity for children and adults.  Due to the
recency of final passage of this bill, we have not yet received the final version.  We will
update you further in upcoming postings.<P>

<strong>FY  97 Appropriations</strong><P>

The House passed a fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education on July 11 by a 216-211 vote.  The House bill would authorize
$27.4 billion in education spending, down from $30.3 billion allocated in 1996.  The bill
would authorize level-funding of part B of IDEA, which would neither account for
increased numbers of students nor inflation.  Discretionary programs under IDEA and
the Javits Act would also be level-funded (with the exception of a much-needed
$900,000 increase in Media and Captioning Services).<P>

The Senate subcommittee responsible for education appropriations is not expected to
meet until September, after Congress returns from its summer recess.  The proposed
Senate bill currently authorizes $850 million less for education than the House-passed
bill.  It is possible that this number could be increased from $1.3 billion in budget
authority that Majority Leader Lott set aside for later distribution.<P>
