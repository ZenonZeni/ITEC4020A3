<HR>As I write these words, I have just finished the Sibley School Annual
Report for my second year as Director. It has been an exciting and productive
year, and I would like to share with you some impressions. Perhaps the most
striking statistic of the School is the continued growth in undergraduate
enrollments and degrees awarded. The figure below shows the history of bachelor
of science degrees in mechanical engineering awarded annually for each of
the last twenty-one years - roughly my tenure at Cornell, having come as
a visiting assistant professor in the fall of 1974. The growth is remarkable
- a virtual doubling of ME graduates to a total of 173 this past year, during
a period when the total number of bachelors degrees awarded by the College
of Engineering at Cornell has remained almost constant. (The plot compares
the number of mechanical engineering graduates each year with 1/8 of the
total number of graduates in engineering, since the Sibley School faculty
constitutes approximately 1/8 of the total college faculty; thus the plot
also informs us that the 'productivity' of the Sibley School faculty - at
least in terms of undergraduate engineering degrees - has grown to more
than twice the average for the college.) <BR>

<P><HR>What are the forces driving this continued interest in mechanical
engineering? I have no quantitative data on which to base an answer to this
question, but there are several, rather obvious, factors that may be responsible.
First, the trend is consistent with those at other engineering colleges
throughout the country, so there must be national forces at work. I believe
these include the 'durability' of a mechanical engineering degree based,
at least in part, on the breadth of a mechanical engineering education and
the recognition of the importance of manufacturing to the health of the
national economy. And, of course, manufacturing is an inherently mechanical
engineering activity. Second, I believe the trend also is influenced by
factors local to Cornell. As can be seen from a number of items in this,
and other, editions of Sibley School Newsletters, there is a great deal
of project activity in the School. These projects provide students with
hands-on experience in design and the construction of engineering prototypes,
help to develop communication skills and encourage teamwork, and motivate
the students to further study in a variety of technical areas. In addition,
the enthusiasm of the students for this project activity is an extremely
effective advertisement for mechanical engineering as seen by freshmen and
sophomores.<BR>
<BR>
The quality of the faculty and the curriculum also must be factors, but
my perception is that these are uniformly excellent across the engineering
fields at Cornell, so cannot be responsible for large differences in growth
rates between the various undergraduate programs. We were pleased to see
that, in this spring's U. S. News and World Report rankings of graduate
programs in engineering, Cornell's ranking improved to sixth in the nation
among research-intensive universities. Also, we were very pleased with the
results of a review of the Sibley School by an External Review Committee
this past February. The review committee, consisting of distinguished academics
and engineers from industry, and chaired by Dr. Richard Aubrecht ('66, MS
'68, Ph.D. '70), Chairman of the Board of Moog, Inc., found the School and
its programs to be of substantially higher quality than had been perceived
by most of the committee members before their visit. They concluded their
report to Dean John Hopcroft with the words, &quot;This is a very good department.
Don't mess with it too much!&quot; But a more complete discussion of that
review, including our plans for the future, will have to wait for the next
issue!<BR>
