<P>
Ethiolist Services is run on a commercial network and there is a cost associated
to these services. The cost is paid by the Ethiolist Managing Team. In order to
cover the cost of maintenance and usage of resources, Ethiolist accepts
financial support from subscribers. We feel contributions in the amount of
$25/year (U.S.) -a little over two dollars a month - would help us maintain the
existing systems and also help us to add more features which we have not been
able to bring due to limitations of resources.
