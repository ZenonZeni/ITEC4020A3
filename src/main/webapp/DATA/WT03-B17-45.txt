<h3><center>Get the facts:  How alcohol affects your body</center></H3>
Alcohol (Ethyl Alcohol, Ethanol, CH3 CH2 OH) is a powerful drug.  In small quantities (one half of one ounce) it acts as a stimulant and improves functioning in most people.  More than that causes a depressant effect in your body and impairs functioning.<p>
Even low doses of alcohol reduce sensitivity to taste and odor.  Alcohol dulls sensitivity to pain.  High doses of alcohol decrease your ability to discriminate between lights of different intensities and narrow your visual field.  This latter effect may be particularly dangerous in automobile driving.  Sensitivity to certain colors, especially red, appears to decrease.<p>
The direct action of alcohol on your body, coupled with its ability to relax feelings of self-criticism and inhibition,  produce the "high" associated with alcohol use.  Some studies show that alcohol tends to decrease fear and increase likelihood that an individual will accept risks.  For example, when a group of bus drivers were given drinks, they were more likely to try to drive their buses through spaces that were too narrow -- and seemingly more willing to risk failure -- than when they were sober.  The judgement and skill impairment was not predictable on the basis of amount consumed:  some drivers were more affected by two whiskeys than others were by six.<p>
Reaction time is measured by the rapidity with which you make a simple movement, such as pressing a button in response to a sound or visual signal.  Below a blood alcohol level of 0.07 percent, reaction times slow measurably.  Higher levels consistently produce larger performance failures.  A much greater effect of alcohol on reaction time is found when attention is divided, as when you are at the same time engaged in another task.<p>
Other tests measuring both speed and accuracy suggest that alcohol has a greater effect on accuracy and consistency than it does on speed.  A person who has had several drinks tends to "breeze through" a complex test but makes more errors than she or he normally would and is more erratic in her/his response.  Many people, however, feel their performance has improved and refuse to believe otherwise, even when shown the poor results.<p>
The effects of alcohol on sleep are known to anyone who has gone to bed after having too much to drink, only to toss and turn and waken the next day feeling headachy and fatigued.  Taking several drinks before bedtime has been found to decrease the amount of REM (rapid eye movement) or dreaming sleep.  The consequences of being deprived of REM sleep are impaired concentration and memory, as well as anxiety, tiredness, and irritability.<p>
Here are the facts.  Make your decisions wisely!
<p><p>
<H3><center>Sipping Tips</center></H3>
<ul>
<li>Pace yourself -- no more than one drink per hour.
<li>One drink is one ounce of alcohol -- that's one beer, one glass of wine, one mixed drink.
<li>Set a limit on how much you will drink in the entire evening -- stick to your limit.
<li>Eat before and while you drink.
<li>Never drink and drive; never ride with someone who has been drinking.</ul>

<H3><center>The White Elephant</center></H3>
<p>
If you are the child of an alcohol abuser, you may be under pressure to be the family "rescuer" or "hero."  You may also abuse alcohol yourself.  Children of alcohol abusers often become successes or failure largely in reaction to the financial and emotional insecurity, social embarrassment and other painful alcohol-related experiences they had at home.  Even as adults, many children of alcohol abusers have a difficult time breaking free from the beliefs, behavior and feelings they learned as youngsters.<p>
A national survey comparing children of people who have drinking problems to children of people who do not found that children of alcohol abusers are:
<ul>
<li>four times more likely to become alcoholics
<li>more likely to abuse other drugs
<li>more likely to develop other patterns of compulsive behavior such as overeating and other eating disorders.
<li>twice as likely to marry alcoholics
<li>more apt to attempt and commit suicide
</ul><p>
These children also are apt to develop:  persistent feelings of anxiety, abandonment, anger, depression, guilt, and shame; an extreme need for control; an inability to trust others; and low self-esteem.  Many of these feelings go back to the small child's mistaken belief that if she or he could find the right way to behave, their unpredictable, alcohol-abusing parent would behave better, or at least more consistently.<p>
Other members of the family also frequently have their own mistaken beliefs about how to cope with the alcohol abuser.  For a variety of reasons, the entire family may start habitually denying that the problem exists.  "Family members can't believe alcohol abuse is going on and don't want to believe it's going on," says one expert in the field.  "It's like having this big white elephant in the middle of the living room and everyone is walking around it."<p>
If you think there is a big white elephant in the middle of your living room, you are better off dealing with it than not.  College offers you the opportunity to get a better perspective.  Take this opportunity now; use the college environment to help yourself.<p>
