<p>The following graph (Source: MJSPRD) shows at a-glance the
effect of the Moscone Act on marijuana arrests. Felony marijuana
arrests fell by about 80,000, from nearly 100,000 in 1974 to less
than 20,000 in 1976. Misdemeanor marijuana arrests were not
recorded between 1972 and 1977, but leaped tenfold from about
3,500 in 1972 to 35,424 in 1978. By 1984, total marijuana arrests
were leveling off at below 64,000 a year, so the cumulative
effect of the Moscone Act was to reduce total marijuana arrests
by at least 36,000 a year. </p>

<p><img src="mjfm6084.gif" width="374" height="370"> </p>

<h2>EFFECT OF THE MOSCONE ACT ON MARIJUANA ARRESTS</h2>

<p>In 1974 felony marijuana arrests peaked at nearly 100,000
(99,597), representing about one-fourth (24.75 percent) of the
felony arrests in the state (Table 7) and over two-thirds (69.21
percent) of the state's felony drug arrests (line 41 MJSPRD).
This was the situation the Moscone Act was designed to alleviate.
</p>

<p>The Moscone Act had an effect even before it officially went
into effect on January 1, 1976. Its immediate effect upon passage
in July 1975 was to reduce the number of felony marijuana arrests
by 13,840 from their 1974 level, and by another whopping 66,473
arrests in 1976. In two years felony marijuana arrests dropped
from nearly 100,000 to fewer than 20,000 (Table 7). </p>

<p>This caused 1976 statewide felony arrests to fall
precipitously by about 75,OOO from their 1974 level (Table 7). </p>

<p>That is, felony marijuana arrests fell from 25 percent of
statewide felony arrests in 1974 to a mere 6 percent in 1976
(line 43 MJSPRD), and from 7.22 percent of total
felony-misdemeanor arrests in 1974 to only 1.41 percent in 1976
(Table 7). </p>

<p>The reduction of felony marijuana arrests was permanent and
remains the most important effect of the Moscone Act. Felony
marijuana arrests crept past 20,000 in 19809 and have leveled off
at about 21,000 a year since then (Table 7). </p>

<p>This loss of about 80,000 felony marijuana ay-rests each year
from 1976 to 1984 represents a considerable savings to the
taxpayer. Cumulatively, it means that about 720,000 felony
arrests and dispositions did not have to be paid for during the
nine-year period. </p>

<p>135) The other major effect of the Moscone Act was to increase
the number of misdemeanor marijuana arrests, though the exact
amount of the increase cannot be ascertained because misdemeanor
marijuana arrests were not recorded in the base year period
(1972-77). It is also difficult to know precisely what
misdemeanor marijuana arrests were recorded from 1978 onwards,
because the Moscone Act allows the issuance of a citation for
possession offenses and the offender need not appear at the
police station or in court where the arrest would be recorded
(see Chapter III). </p>

<p>However, with the available information it can be stated that
the overall effect of the Moscone Act was to reduce total
marijuana arrests by at least 36,000 a year. This is based on the
fact that in 1974 there were about 100,000 felony marijuana
arrests, plus an unknown number of misdemeanor arrests, while in
1984 there were 21,350 felony marijuana arrests, plus 42,219
misdemeanor marijuana arrests, for a total of 63,569 marijuana
arrests (Table 7). 100,000 felony arrests minus 63,500 total
arrests indicates a reduction of at least 36,413 arrests each
year. </p>

<p>Table 8 below summarizes the ARRCOST file appended to this
report. The A. Alan Post method (see Chapter II) was used to
calculate actual marijuana arrest expenditures, and the State and
Local Government implicit Price Deflator (see INFLATE appendix)
was used to adjust for inflation. </p>

<p>For the years immediately surrounding the Moscone Act
(1973-77), including the base year 1974, misdemeanor marijuana
arrest statistics are not available and the cost of making felony
marijuana arrests is shown in Table 8 for those years. If
misdemeanor arrests were included, the total arrests and total
expenditures would be higher for those years, but the cost per
arrest would probably be lower. </p>

<p>Between 1972 and 1984, actual expenditures for marijuana
arrests rose 131 percent, from $13.2 million in 1972 to $30.5
million in 1984 (Table B). Let's look at that in two periods, the
short-term effect through 1979 and the long-term effect through
1984. </p>

<p>The immediate effect of the Moscone Act was to reduce total
marijuana arrests (felony and misdemeanor combined) from over
100,000 in 1974 to about 52,000 in 1979. As a result, actual
marijuana arrest expenditures were held to approximately $14.8
million in fiscal 1978/79, a bit lower than their fiscal 1972/73
levels (Table 8). </p>

<p>The 1979 cost of $284.05 per marijuana arrest compares with
1974's $184.55 figure. However, in 1974 dollars the 1979 cost per
arrest was only $190.89. Thus, when adjusted for inflation, a
major result of the Moscone Act was a mere $6.34 increase in the
cost per arrest (Table 8). </p>

<p>This means that during a time when statewide law enforcement
costs in general were rising sharply due to inflation increasing
arrest volume, and other factors, the Moscone Act held the line
on marijuana arrest costs. To be precise, it was the best
cost-containment measure passed by the Legislature in the 1970s:
the same containment of actual and inflation adjusted
expenditures cannot be discerned for any other type of crime. </p>

<p>The 1984 cost per marijuana arrest was $480.24, compared with
$172.68 in 1972 and $184.55 in 1974. This is a 178 percent rise
in expenditures per marijuana arrest since 19729 caused by
reducing the number of marijuana arrests while law enforcement
costs in general continued to rise (Table 8). </p>

<p>However, when adjusted for inflation and expressed in 1974
dollars, the cost of marijuana arrests in 1984 was $13,979,105
(line 13) or $219.90 per arrest. This is only slightly higher
than the $13,220,270 spent on marijuana arrests in 1972, and is
24 percent lower than the $18,380,911 spent in the base fiscal
year 1973/74. </p>

<p>Thus the net effect of the Moscone Act was to reduce inflation
adjusted marijuana arrest expenditures by 24 percent from 1974 to
1984, and to contain marijuana arrest costs at just above their
1972 level. Again, there is no other crime in the state for which
this can be said. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, actual expenditures for marijuana arrests have
been rising steadily in the Eighties, from about $20 million in
1980 to over $30 million in 1984. Total marijuana arrests seem to
have leveled off at about 639000 a year, but expenditures keep
rising due to inflation and generally increased law enforcement
costs. </p>

<p>In sum, it costs the taxpayers an average of about $500 every
time someone is arrested for marijuana in California, regardless
of whether that is a felony or misdemeanor arrest. This figure
includes only the cost of making an arrest, not the cost of
processing the offender later. This cost per marijuana arrest can
be expected to continue to rise. </p>
