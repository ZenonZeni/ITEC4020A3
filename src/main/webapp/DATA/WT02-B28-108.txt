<STRONG>Life Insurance Protection For You and Your Family</STRONG><BR>
New York Life, in cooperation with thousands of employers across the country, offers a
program that assists employees in providing protection and
financial security
for themselves and their families. This program allows employees of participating companies
to
purchase individual universal
life insurance
coverage through voluntary payroll deduction<STRONG><SUP>1</SUP></STRONG>.  Here are just a
few of the important
features offered:

<P>
<STRONG><SUP>1</SUP></STRONG> Participation in the payroll
deduction life
insurance program
is completely voluntary. Since this program is not intended to be subject to the
Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), participating employers cannot contribute to or endorse
any policy offered
under this program.

<P>
<STRONG>Competitive Rates</STRONG> - This policy is available to employees of participating
companies.
Through payroll deduction, we are able to offer rates that are competitive.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG> - With universal life employees can adapt their plan to
accommodate their
changing needs
throughout the years. For instance,
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Premiums can be adjusted to satisfy an employee's changing needs and/or new budget.
<LI>The policy provides an increasing cash value, which may be used for
emergencies, retirement,
college education, or other financial needs.
<LI>Employees also have the option to increase or decrease the policy death benefit or
cash accumulation
value without purchasing an additional policy.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Easy Participation</STRONG> - Completion of a short, simple application is
usually all
that's needed. Physical
exams are usually not necessary.<P>
<STRONG>Control &amp; Portability</STRONG> - Individual employees own their policy, so they
can
tailor it to
meet their own
needs. Should employees leave
their present employer for any reason, they can continue their policy without any
change in premiums or
 benefits.<P>
<STRONG>Convenient Payments</STRONG> - There are no checks for employees to write, and
nothing for
them to mail. Premiums
are deducted from their paychecks before they receive them. <P>
<STRONG>Optional Family Coverage</STRONG> - An employee's spouse, children, and even
grandchildren
may be able to obtain high
quality insurance protection - even if the employee doesn't participate.<P>

<STRONG>Common Questions</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Who is Eligible for a Policy?</STRONG><BR>
All full-time employees (30+ hrs/wk) of participating companies, ages 16-65, who have been
working
at least
six months may
apply for coverage.
<P>
<STRONG>Does This Replace Other Employer-Provided Group Life
Insurance?</STRONG><BR>
No, this individual life insurance supplements any existing insurance that employees may
have. Unlike many
group life insurance programs, it isn't reduced or eliminated when employees retire or
leave the company.
<P>
<STRONG>When Does the Insurance Begin?</STRONG><BR>
Immediately. Once an employee signs the application and the Payroll Deduction Authorization
form, insurance is
provided, under a temporary coverage agreement, until a permanent policy is
issued.
<P>
<STRONG>What Happens if an Employee Leaves the Company?</STRONG><BR>
An employee who leaves the company is billed directly, in the manner that is most convenient
for him
or her. New York Life
provides him or her
with the flexibility to be billed on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. The
amount of 
premium changes to reflect the billing option chosen.<P>
<STRONG>How Does the Cash Value of the Policy Grow?</STRONG><BR>
Cash values earn a competitive interest rate, which is credited and compounded
monthly. The cash
accumulation values grow income tax deferred and the interest rate credited is
guaranteed never to fall
below 4.5%.
<P>
<STRONG>Can  Additional Insurance be Purchased at a Later Date?</STRONG><BR>
Universal life insurance offers  the flexibility to adjust the insurance
coverage (within policy limits) to
accommodate changing needs.
<P>
<STRONG>How Does an Employee Know What Program is Best for Them?</STRONG><BR>
A New York Life agent  provides individualized counseling to help employees decide
what coverage
satisfies their needs and objectives.<P>
New York Life offers quality products, fast and efficient service, and an
outstanding track record of
proven success. New York Life has a long tradition of providing personal,
confidential service to people
across the country.
