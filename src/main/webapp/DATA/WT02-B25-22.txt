Netfortress is a hardware-based approach to intranet security.  As a
standalone unit or with a firewall, it offers point-to-point encrypted
transmissions between the computer or LAN it protects and an outside
network.  NetFortress encrypts the entire application layer and the
transport-layer headers.  This type of network-layer encryption leaves
no information exposed, thus preventing any manipulation of communications
packets' content.
<p>
NetFortress automatically authenticates communications at both ends of
the transmission, eliminating user intervention in the verification
process.  A public-based 512-bit dual key exchange, with keys changing
every 24 hours, ensures that only users with NetFortress boxes are allowed
to access encrypted information.  "User names, priorities and passwords
should be used as additional security because NetFortress binds to the
desktop unit", said Dr. Aharon Friedman, founder, chairman and chief
technology officer of DSN Technology.
<p>
Installed by plugging in two cables, NetFortress automatically finds
and locks onto the host or server's IP/ethernet address.  A plug-and-play
box roughly the size of a VCR, NetFortress is compatible with all hardware
platforms and operating systems.  It also eliminates the maintenance and
monitoring required by firewall products. "It is not a firewall, but the
NetFortress box can serve in tandem with one for increased security", said
Clark Frederick, chief applications officer with IBS Interactive, a high-end
Internet-service provider in Madison, NJ.
<p>
NetFortress, operating at T1-line speeds, can encrypt and secure communications
for companies that now prefer Internet tunneling to leased lines.
It costs $4,995 for a single host and $8,995 for a LAN.
