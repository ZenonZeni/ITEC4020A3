IBM ATTEMPTING TO SECURE CYBERSPACE FOR DEVELOPERS

       IBM Corp. is working to help protect copyright and licensing
rights of content developers heading for cyberspace. 
       To do that, IBM this spring plans to launch its cryptolope
technology which will protect copyrighted content from being pilfered
by cybersurfers who have not paid for the content.
       The issue is a huge concern for developers, who want to protect
their copyrighted material and ensure that they are compensated when
their content is downloaded from the Net.
       The technology will be available for use through IBM's new
Internet information service, infoMarket, which will provide
comprehensive financial and industry-specific information.
       "Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for buyers and
sellers to get together" in a secure environment, IBM spokesperson
Matthew Van Ryn told New Media Week.  "Right now...there's nothing to
prevent someone from dropping [copyrighted material] in e-mail and
sending it to 1,000 of their closest friends."
       Ultimately, the technology will give developers control over the
pricing and rights to a piece of copyrighted information.
       IBM plans to take 10 to 20 percent "or whatever it's going to
be," of what the content provider charges the user, said Van Ryn. That
percentage will be fixed and the company has no plans to charge
subscription or online fees.
       Industry analysts believe that the technology may even help to
encourage the proliferation of online content developers who have,
thus far, been weary of unauthorized mass-distribution of their work
over the Internet.
       In theory, online developers have instant access to consumers at
little or no transaction costs.  
       "The difficulty is that [their content] has been freely
forwardable to everybody else," said Dean Gloster, a partner in the
Multimedia group of San Francisco law firm Farella, Braun & Martel.
"Copyright infringement is a hobby on the Internet," he added.
Reaping Benefits
       It's not only IBM that stands to profit from the new technology.
             Developers will benefit in two ways:  they will not have
to convert their databases for online use, and they will have control
over how the content looks and how much subscribers pay for it, said
Van Ryn.
       The technology holds so much promise for increased security, not
to mention greater contact with customers, that such content providers
as American Business Information Inc. (ABI) have already signd on as
one of IBM's pre-eminent content providers.
       ABI provides Yellow Pages information for every U.S. community.
       IBM measured up to ABI's criteria for choosing an online vehicle
for its content.
       "What we do is look at the firewalls that [an Internet service]
can demonstrate to us," said Bill Kerrey, ABI's senior vice president
of business development.

CAMBRIX, TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX CROSS-PROMOTE AVIATION PRODUCTS

       Piggybacking on the marketing strength of major film studios,
new media companies like Cambrix Publishing are discovering that
cross-promoting their titles with hit movies is a sure-fire way to
boost unit sales.
       Last week, the company launched a marketing campaign with
Twentieth Century Fox to promote Cambrix's Wild Blue Yonder aviation
CD-ROM set and Fox's Broken Arrow feature film about futuristic B-3
bomber pilots.  
       Integral to the strategy is a rebate offer that aviation fans
may find hard to resist.  With any purchase of the CD-ROM set between
January 1 and April 15, Cambrix will rebate the full price of a movie
ticket (up to $7.50) to see Fox's Broken Arrow.
       "We [plan] to use the resources of the studios whenever
possible," said Cambrix Vice President Richard Hart.  
       One of the best ways to promote a title is tie it or complement
a movie.  "Then you piggyback on someone else's promotion," and
benefit from the association, said Hart.
       "The [airplane] technology you see in Broken Arrow...is very
integral to the [movie's] plot," he said.  "Because of that...people
will want to know more about what these fighters are all about."
       Hence, Cambrix's CD-ROMs that detail the history of aviation and
the technology "deepens people's appreciation for the movie," said
Hart.

Traditional Vs. Non-traditional

       Lauded as the first time a film studio and CD-ROM publisher have
cross-promoted somewhat unrelated products, the strategy is a mix of
traditional and non-traditional marketing strategies.
       The rebate offer requires the consumer to mail the CD-ROM
receipt and movie ticket stub into Cambrix for full refund on the cost
of the movie.
       With a suggested retail price of $19.99, Cambrix claims this is
one of the most significant rebate offers undertaken to date.  But
it's not the only movie rebate offer ever undertaken.
       Walt Disney last year recruited the 2,600 movie theaters
planning to show its animated film Toy Story to offer movie-goers a $5
Toy Story videogame rebate coupon at ticket windows.  Consumers had to
then bring their ticket stub to Toys "R" Us for their discount.

Marketing Beyond Rebates

       In addition to the rebate offer, Fox provided Cambrix access to
the movie, printed materials, movie posters that include the CD-ROM
advertisement and several pages within its Web site devoted to the
Wild Blue Yonder/Broken Arrow promotion. (The site will launch today
at www.brokenarrow.com.)  Fox also will further promote the Web site
heavily in print, poster and television advertising of the film.
       Within the site is an factual area on today's B-2 bombers and
related material of Cambrix's title.  "There's very nice synergy...and
also some real "meat" to the site itself," said Hart.  Users can pull
up aviation information as well as download clips from the site.  
       In return, Fox generates interest within the computer
marketplace.  "And because of the demographics and the technical base
of the movie...it ties in nicely," said Hart.  "For Fox, they reach a
market they didn't have access to."
       What's particularly unique about this campaign is that the
products are not directly related to one another.  They do, however,
share a common theme: Broken Arrow stars John Travolta and Christian
Slater as stealth bomber pilots engaged in an unimaginable conflict;
Wild Blue Yonder is a two CD-ROM disc interactive exploration of the
triumphs and tragedies of aviation.
       Finally, the marketing strategy also will include a sweepstakes
offering prizes including a trip for two to Hollywood and a visit to
Twentieth Century Fox lot.
       Fans can enter via the Broken Arrow Web site or through America
Online's Cinema POV Area, which also is highlighting the promotion and
enabling cybersurfers to enter the contest.

Exception or the Norm

       Several multimedia developers told New Media Week this size
marketing blitz is becoming more than norm than the exception.
       "If you look at the amount of money being put into developing
[titles], it's no wonder the cost of marketing them is going up,"
added Ken Christie, vice president of marketing for the Interactive
Multimedia Association.  "They have to get some kind of a return on
their investment."
       Cambrix, however, seems to be getting the best of both worlds: 
it's successfully sells its product to movie-goers on a national basis
while only chipping in $100,000 of its own marketing dollars.  
       And compared to Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Walt Disney
and Acclaim Entertainment's multi-million dollar marketing campaigns,
Cambridge's budget is just a drop in the bucket.

Security on the Horizon

IBM's upcoming cryptolope technology promises to offer security to
content developers considering online distribution of their material.
       Here's how it works: users who want to purchase any content
offered through IBM's infoMarket Service will receive the material in
a sealed cryptolope container (short for "encrypted envelope") along
with a key to unlock the package.
       Users can purchase whole or partial material. After the content
is downloaded, printed or read, the cryptolope reseals to prevent
subsequent copying or transmitting of the material, thereby ensuring
that the user pays for it each time.

EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TARGET SCHOOLS TO HELP BOOST SAGGING
RETAIL SALES

       With the top selling educational software titles scoring a
fraction of the sales of their entertainment counterparts, educational
software publishers must also begin tapping the school market to
generate additional revenue.
       Although Pixel Genius Entertainment's first title Pocahontas was
successful in the retail market-it ranked among educational top
sellers at 5,000 copies per month for its first five months-the
company has discovered that it can boost its profits by selling to
educational institutions.
       "There's a much more limited market segment for educational
titles [than entertainment titles], and this is no exception," said
Paul Janavs, co-president of Pixel. "Entertainment products are aimed
at a much larger target market. But the [education] market is growing
very rapidly and it still has a whole other side of distribution,
which is the school market."
       Pixel is banking on increasing its profits by 75 percent by
jumping into this virtually untapped market. 
       On Feb. 1 it will introduce the teacher's version of Pocahontas,
a reading-oriented title. Unlike the retail version, this one will be
packed with cross-curriculum activities, touching not only on language
arts, but on math and science as well.  
       The company declined to disclose sales figures or projections on
the upcoming version.

A Retail Supplement

Jack Bocock, marketing director of Boxer Inc., another educational
software developer, agrees that the industry can count on schools for
heavy sales.  His company targets only that segment of the market.  
       "Real education titles are natural for a school environment,"
Bocock said.  "The [retail] channel is a tough channel for all of us. 
There are few who make money in that channel, even entertainment
software.  For real educational titles, [the retail market] is not
feasible."
       But some industry analysts disagree.  Peter Rogers, an analyst
with Bear Stearns & Co. , said focusing solely on the school market is
rare.  
       Targeting consumers first has worked best for such major
educational software companies as The Learning Co. , Davidson &
Associates and Broderbund .
       "Sometimes they've supplemented their efforts by going  directly
to schools, but it's consumers that drive the business," he said.

Tackling Distribution

       Pixel, however, is not deterred.  To reach the education market,
the company first found a target market less crowded with competitors. 
             Pocahontas is one of the few educational titles that
targets an older age group, Janavs said. It's aimed at 5- to
10-year-olds instead of 3- to 6-year-olds, like most reading titles.
       On the distribution front, the company is signing up with
special wholesalers who distribute exclusively to education buyers.  
       Pixel also has contacted mail-order catalogs that cater to
teachers. 
       The company is even tailoring its packaging for the education
market by offering the teacher's version in bulk packs of 30 and
additional 5-pack for student computer laboratories.  
       By focusing its marketing strategy on this niche, Pixel is
betting it can earn profits totaling three-quarters of what it earns
in its retail market.  

Differentiating Itself 

       With competition fierce, Pixel implemented several strategies to
ensure the success of its Pocahontas school edition.
       Unique to this Pocahontas version are activities designed for
the Internet.  
       "We haven't seen [internet activities on educational software]
done, but we know schools are very excited about the Internet," said
Pixel's Janavs.
       "We're trying to provide [educators] with Internet activities
related to the Pocahontas story book so students will learn to use the
internet as a research tool by gathering information about the history
of Pocahontas."
       The teacher's version also includes a teacher's manual that
provides tear-out pages for worksheets and extension activities for
students.  

Future Plans

       Pixel also is taking great care with the versions of products it
hopes to distribute to nationwide classrooms.             
       Most importantly, the company learned from educators that
building a child's confidence in the title is more effective than
speaking down to them. "You don't need to oversimplify things for
children," he said.
       Upcoming company plans include expanding its Reading Success for
Kids series with Jack and the Beanstalk, due out this month, and an
Aladdin title, which will hit store shelves March 1.

NEW MEDIA NEWS IN BRIEF

Competition Heating Up
     U.S.-based multimedia developers soon will face even more
competition in light of the growing trend of distributing foreign
multimedia titles in the United States. 
     Case in point:  National distributor Navarre Corp.'s Digital
Entertainment subsidiary has entered into an exclusive U.S.
distribution agreement with OmniMedia, the U.K.'s first dedicated
multimedia producer and publisher.
     Digital Entertainment will begin distributing OmniMedia's CD-ROM
catalogue in late April, featuring such titles as The Ultimate Video
JukeBox: Volume 1 and The Greatest Toy Shop on Earth.
     Founded in 1993, London-based OmniMedia owns a best-selling
catalog with 12 titles, movies, general interest titles and children's
CD-ROM titles.  
     Digital Entertainment develops, licenses, publishes and
distributes interactive CD titles focusing on music and entertainment. 
It also merchandises, markets and distributes computer software titles
to traditional and non-traditional retail outlets.  (Tech Solutions
for Navarre, 212/696-2000)

Pulitzer Embraces the Web
     Signaling that big industry multimedia developers still believe
the Internet is a good place to leverage their content, Pulitzer
Publishing Co. has introduced the information service POSTnet to the
Web.
     POSTnet--the interactive supplement to the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch--includes news, sports, entertainment, directories,
community forums, chats and other material. Pulitzer also will be an
Internet access provider for people in the St. Louis metropolitan
area.
     Large segments of POSTnet content are available at no charge to
all Internet users, while use of full newswires, Post-Dispatch
archives, and POSTnet newsgroups are limited to POSTnet subscribers.
(Connie Hoffman, 314/865-8500).


Interactive Marketing Grows
     Multimedia developers aspiring to market their services
interactively take note: Interactive Media Works and Phoneworks have
teamed to form Phonivation, a new venture dedicated to developing and
managing interactive programs for major interactive marketing
campaigns.
     The alliance will market such proprietary products and services
as IMW's SampleNET CARD and Phoneworks' Electronic Green Stamps. 
     St. Petersburg-based Phoneworks specializes in using interactive
technologies for advertising, marketing and promotions, and works with
packaged goods, entertainment, cable, broadcast and Madison Avenue
companies to design marketing and implementation plans.
     Overland, Kansas-based Interactive Media Works specializes in
direct response and strategic marketing applications of interactive
media and other new technologies.  (Interactive Media Works
913/385-0055)

Crowded  Arena Developing
     Edutainment developers step aside for new competition.  Harber
Brother Productions has launched its new KinderActive children's
CD-ROM publishing arm.  In so doing, the company will produce and
market CD-ROMs and enhanced CDs that combine children's music,
characters and stories with digital graphics. 
     Leading the charge will be Nicole Silver, director of production. 
Silver is a producer at Lancit Media, a leading children's television
production firm that produces Puzzle Place, Reading Rainbow and
Backyard Safari.   
     Under the KinderActive line will be the KinderActive Musicals and
KinderActive Minds labels.  KinderActive Musicals is a new genre of
entertainment products for kids age three to eight that feature songs,
characters and stories on CD-ROM and enhanced CD formats.  (Tech
Solutions for Harber Bros., 212/696-2000)

Airview Appoints Maners VP
     The Network Connection Inc. last week named a new vice president
of marketing for its in-flight entertainment product called Airview. 
Del Maners, formerly vice president of sales for Burnes
Aerospace-West, joins TNCI's Aerospace division in that capacity.      
     Airview is among the first to deliver full-motion entertainment
screens mounted in seatbacks on passenger planes.  
     The Airview entertainment system consists of in-flight on-demand
movies, music videos, interactive computer games, destination travel
videos, city entertainment videos, faxing and Internet access for Web
site viewing.  (The Network Connection, 800/327-4853)

NBC Snags Boles 
     NBC Super Channel named Nicholas Boles head of new media,
responsible for the introduction of new revenue generating activities
in the areas of data broadcasting, interactive services, online
services, multimedia and specialized business broadcasting.
     Boles joins NBC from the consultant firm Media Strategy
Innovation.  Prior to Media Strategy, he held senior management
positions with EMI Music, Strategy Research Associates, Mirror Group
Television, British Satellite Broadcasting and BBC Subscription
Television.  (NBC Super Channel, 44 181 600 6600)

In Development: 
The "pornography police" will have a field day when they stumble upon
racks of "erotic" multimedia products displayed in plain view.
     Mature Multimedia, which is creating a merchandising program
aimed at snatching up prime retail real estate for its erotic
products, is planning to do just that.
     Wow!, the 60,000-square-foot multimedia superstore co-owned by
Tower Records and The Good Guys!, will be Mature Multimedia's partner
in crime, serving as the initial site for the pilot that will test
consumer acceptance of the program.
     Ten publishers of PG-13, NC-17 and R-Rated CD-ROM jewel-cased
titles will be involved in the market research study that combines a
low-tech retail merchandising display rack with high-tech multimedia
and the Internet.
     But those concerned about "negatively influencing" their
loved-ones' minds, beware.
     The CD-ROM sampler will use a 3D graphical interactive television
interface that will enable CD-ROM browsers to preview the products
sold.  (A Web address also (www.intermaginary.com) provides links to
all participating publishers' Web sites in the program.) 
     Until now, Mature Multimedia products have been classified and
displayed with graphic XXX adult products.  As a result, sales of
"softer erotic content" have suffered, said the company.  
     Hence, the pilot program opens a new channel to retail so
consumers can browse through the "in-between titles"-  those that may
not be suitable for young, hardcore gamers, but don't classify as
X-rated material.  

***
     Although maintaining a less-than-admirable track record as a
conduit for gameplay, at least three more multimedia industry giants
are betting that the Internet will, no doubt, be a great place for
synchronized PC gaming.
     The Total Entertainment Network, Catapult Entertainment and Mpath
Interactive are preparing Web-based services designed to enable
multiple players to battle it out over the Internet.
     But what about the never-ending complaints that the Internet is
simply too slow and unresponsive to attract hardcore gamers?  
"No problem," say each of the developers.   
     Overcoming this problem (believed to exist because of so much
incompatible software processing PC commands at different speeds) can
be overcome by writing their own proprietary software for synchronized
game play over the network.  Or so they say.
     

***
     It's kind of scary when chess software can beat the game's
leading human grandmasters--everytime. 
     Notably, in the Fifth Harvard Cup Human Versus Computer Intel
Chess Challenge, eight of the top chess programs on the market took on
six of the leading human grandmasters, and at the end of the contest,
WChess beat them all.
     Sierra On-Line, which has inked a deal to produce and sell the
software, will launch it in the form of a game called PowerChes in
November on CD-ROM for Windows 95.
     WChess A1, the engine behind the software, is the result of more
than ten years of development work by the programming team of
Intelligent Heuristic Programming Inc. (Sierra On-Line, Michael
Brochu, 206/649-9800)

***
     Targeting the choosy, hard-to-please or compulsive consumer,
Integrated Communications and Entertainment Inc. (ICE) is teaming with
WAVE Interactive Network (WIN) to allow consumers to taste-test
content before plunking down the big bucks.
     Mirroring furniture depots and office hardware suppliers across
the country, consumers will be able to buy diverse CD-ROMs on a
pay-per-use basis, rent-to-own, try-before-you-buy or by an outright
purchase through the new venture.
     In addition, consumers will be able to purchase or rent this
content via CD-ROMs, data broadcast, cable connections and through the
Net.  
     How?  WIN consumers will receive an enormous bundle of enabling
PC hardware, the WaveMeter, the WIN merchandising engine and 20 to 30
CD-ROM titles.
