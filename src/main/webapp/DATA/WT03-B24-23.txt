<H2>MISSION of JIIS</H2>
The mission of the <EM>Journal of Intelligent Information Systems</EM> (JIIS)
is to foster and present research and development results focused on the
integration of artificial intelligence and database technologies to create
next generation information systems -- Intelligent Information Systems.
<BR>
<BR>
These new information systems embody knowledge that allows them to exhibit
intelligent behavior, cooperate with users and other systems in problem
solving, discovery, access, retrieval and manipulation of a wide variety
of multimedia data and knowledge, and reason under uncertainty. Increasingly,
knowledge-directed inference processes are being used to: 
<UL>
  <LI>discover knowledge from large data collections, 
  <LI>provide cooperative support to users in complex query formulation
and refinement,
  <LI>access, retrieve, store and manage large collections of multimedia
data and knowledge, 
  <LI>integrate information from multiple heterogeneous data and knowledge
sources, and
  <LI>reason about information under uncertain conditions. 
</UL>
Multimedia and hypermedia information systems now operate on a global scale
over the Internet, and new tools and techniques are needed to manage these
dynamic and evolving information spaces.<BR>
<BR>
JIIS provides a forum wherein academics, researchers and practitioners may
publish high-quality, original and state-of-the-art papers describing theoretical
aspects, systems architectures, analysis and design tools and techniques,
and implementation experiences in Intelligent Information Systems. The categories
of papers published by JIIS include: research papers, invited papers, meeting
, workshop and conference announcements and reports, survey and tutorial
articles, and book reviews. Short articles describing open problems or their
solutions are also welcome. <BR>
<HR>
<H2>Scope of JIIS</H2>
Topics of interest to JIIS include, but are not limited to the following:
<UL>
  <LI>Foundations and principles of data, information, and knowledge models,
  <LI>Methodologies for IIS analysis, design, implementation, validation,
maintenance and evolution, 
  <LI>User Models, intelligent and cooperative query languages and interfaces,
  <LI>Knowledge representation, integration, fusion, interchange and evolution,
  <LI>Intelligent databases, object-oriented, extended-relational, logic-based,
active databases, and constraint management, 
  <LI>Intelligent information retrieval, digital libraries, and networked
information retrieval, 
  <LI>Distributed multimedia and hypermedia information space design, implementation
and navigation, 
  <LI>Visual interfaces, visual query languages, and visual expressiveness
of IIS, 
  <LI>Machine Learning, knowledge discovery, and data mining, 
  <LI>Uncertainty Management and reasoning under uncertainty, 
  <LI>Applications and Case Studies in novel applications, e.g., global
change, scientific databases, human genome project, Earth Observing System,
manufacturing, telemedicine, education, etc.) 
</UL>
We seek papers that improve on the best academic research or the best industrial
practice. Submitted papers should be motivated by the problems they address
with compelling examples from real or potential applications. Systems papers
must contain interpreted experimentation results either on real systems
or simulations based on representative traces from real systems. Papers
from industrial organizations that discuss implementation of systems and
their use in practice are welcome. Proposals for special issues, especially
on emerging topics, are welcome. <BR>
