Australia's Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on

December 13, 1996 promised a "a planned and balanced migration program" that

would admit 74,000 immigrants per year.  The new government abolished the

Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Bureau of Immigration and Population

Research.<p>

The fallout over a September 10, 1996 speech by a newly elected member of

Parliament, Pauline Hanson, who said that Australia was "in danger of being

swamped by Asians" continued.  Despite a joint parliamentary resolution that

reaffirmed a nondiscriminatory immigration policy, a poll by the Far Eastern

Economic Review found that most senior Asian executives see Australia as less

attractive for investment because of the speech and they believe Prime Minister

John Howard's government has mishandled reactions to it.<p>

According to one poll, 48 percent of Australians agree that there are too

many Asian immigrants arriving.  About five percent of Australia's residents

are "visible minorities."<p>

The Economist summarized one view of changing Australia.  The old Australia

was based on five ideas: a "white Australia", trade protection, centralized

wage arbitration intended to ensure a decent standard of living for all, state

paternalism and the link to the British empire.  Since 1975, the new Australia

has embraced multiculturalism, the dismantling of tariffs, tentative moves away

from centralized wage bargaining, a loss of faith in government and "national

maturity."<p>

According to the World Bank, Australia remains the richest country in the

world, when unexploited natural resources are taken into account.<p>

Australia's Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs maintains a

web site at http://www.immi.gov.au/<p>

In New Zealand, two economists argued that the government's tightening of

business migration laws has reduced the number of Asian investors.  Immigration

requirements imposed in 1996 include tougher English language standards and

place value on business experience.  Of 997 immigrant approvals in October

1996, 14 were for business investors.<p>
