<p>The goal is to develop an Intelligent Underwater Vehicle that
is capable of understanding its surroundings and can organize and
update its internal representation of the real world. </p>

<h4>Underwater Environment:</h4>

<dir>
    <li>positioning represents an outstanding problem: inertial
        and acoustic positioning systems cannot determine the <i>precise</i>
        position of an underwater vehicle; however, in a
        well-known environment, fine positioning (localization) can
        be computed on the basis of the vehicle's relationship
        with its surroundings. </li>
    <li>vision-based environment sensing might be unattractive
        due to murky water, poor visibility and the need for lighting.
        In these conditions, acoustic monitoring methods perform
        better but their sampling frequency is lower. For this
        reason, we have chosen a high-frequency (1.25 Mhz) pencil
        beam profiling sonar, Tritech ST-1000. <h4>Research
        topics:</h4>

        cross-evaluation of the kinematic state of an intelligent
        system and its internal geometric representation of the
        environment.</h4>
        <p>The case under examination involves: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>stationary environment </li>
            <li>planar motion (2-D) </li>
            <li>well-known vehicle heading </li>
            <li>constant linear speed </li>
            <li>underwater environment: relationship between
                robot and real world is measured by a pencil beam profiling
                sonar: range and bearing information. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="local"></a>Localization</h4>
        <p>Assuming perfect &#147;a priori&#148; knowledge of the
        operating environment, the problem of underwater vehicle localization
        using sonar returns from known features can be addressed
        using a suitable potential function whose gradient
        provides a measure of vehicle position error. The
        estimated position is recursively updated on the basis of
        the gradient of the potential function and vehicle
        dynamics by either a simple Least Mean Squares algorithm or
        a Kalman Filter for faster convergence. A fast
        convergence estimation algorithm has been designed for
        the case of marginal speed and position errors (Sliding
        Mode Observer).</p>
        <h4><a name="mapping"></a>Map Reconstruction</h4>
        <p>Drawing on Gibson&#146;s psycophysical observations
        about perception of geometric space, Albus stated that sensor
        data mainly describe the external physical world in terms
        of surfaces. Results obtained from tests using the
        Tritech ST-1000 indicate that sonar data describe the
        external environment primarily in terms of reflecting surfaces
        and their intersections (edges) [Leonard,Moran]. This
        suggests that their projections on the motion plane
        should be considered as the basic entities of the
        environment model. Since linear approximation of reflecting
        surfaces is adopted, segments and vertices are regarded
        as being the fundamental elements for representing space
        in the proposed geometric environment model.<br>
        Each basic entity is described by a set of geometric
        parameters and its likelihood, which measures the probability
        of a basic entity existing on the basis of the sensor
        data acquired until that moment. A segment's geometric
        parameters are position, orientation, length (coordinates
        of the extremes) and their uncertainties. A segment is a
        rigid body described by its center of mass and inertia
        matrix, which specifies its orientation and position/orientation
        uncertainty. It is the line that best fits a set of sonar
        pings which belong to the same reflecting surface in the
        sense of the Least Mean Squares.<br>
        Our map reconstruction algorithm is based on the
        classical Prediction-Comparison-Updating scheme. </p>
