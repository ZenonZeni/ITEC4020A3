Now is a very busy time for CONCAWE. It is not only the large number of
initiatives underway but also their complexity. These days, many more issues
need to be addressed across the boundaries of the different scientific,
technical and economic fields that CONCAWE represents. <BR>

<B>AIR QUALITY </B></center><BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE's work on the EU's Air Quality Framework Directive involves even
more than the five List 1 pollutants mentioned in the article on page 6.
From List 2, there are also benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide
and nickel on which CONCAWE has substantial contributions to develop.<BR>
<BR>
The work for the European Auto/Oil Programme is at last nearing completion.
The results, in the form of European Commission draft proposals for EU legislation,
are due out at any moment. <BR>

<B>MOTOR FUELS AND EMISSIONS </B></center><BR>
<BR>
A major new study commenced by CONCAWE relates to the particulate matter
in car exhaust emissions, focusing on the very fine particles that are emitted
from gasoline as well as from diesel cars. The objective is to quantify
these emissions in terms of particle size and distribution. As a first step,
a literature review of particle size measurement techniques has been completed.
A special effort has started to redefine how best in future to publish the
auto emissions regulations and fuel specifications data in view of its rapidly
growing bulk. <BR>

<B>WATER QUALITY, SOIL &amp; WASTE MANAGEMENT</B> </center><BR>
<BR>
The EU is developing a coordinated range of policies and legislative instruments
to cover all aspects of water management. These include water supply, groundwater
protection, quality of the aquatic environment, discharges to water and
other aspects. These will also relate to the Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control Directive (IPPC). To be in a position to respond to these developments,
CONCAWE has an active task force on a risk assessment approach to soil and
groundwater clean-up targets which is making good progress. A new task force
to look at aspects of Best Available Technology (BAT) and its relationship
to the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) approach is in the process of
being formed.<BR>
<BR>
The two task forces on waste legislation and refinery waste have completed
and reported their work and have been wound up.

<B>REFINING PLANNING</B></center> <BR>
<BR>
The 1994 Planning Cycle supply/demand basis for the years 2000 and 2010
(CONCAWE Document 95/02) has served well for evaluation of the refining
implications of the road fuels in the Auto/Oil Programme (see page 10).
Now, a new Planning Cycle has been started which will update and extend
the timescale of the plans to 2020. Discussions with the European Commission's
DG-XVII (Energy Directorate) have been held to initiate the work. <BR>

<B>OIL PIPELINES</B> </center><BR>
<BR>
The 1994 results of the annual spillage performance survey are briefly summarized
in the article on page 22. These regular surveys (recorded in publications
dating back to 1973) are now proving their value as the EU has commenced
a study into major hazards aspects of pipelines. CONCAWE is participating
in this study and the performance reports provide a unique record demonstrating
the safety of well-managed pipelines as a means to transport oil products.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE will also participate and is assisting with the organization of
a workshop on pipelines which will be held under the auspices of the OECD
in Oslo in June. <BR>

<B>SAFETY MANAGEMENT</B> </center><BR>
<BR>
The first report on the frequency of accidents in the European Oil Industry
will be produced shortly and is summarized in the article on page 20. A
new task force on the vetting of barges used for transporting oil and petrochemical
products has attracted wide support from member companies. The aim is to
ensure that these barges are 'fit for purpose' but, at the same time, to
minimize the number of inspections by the sharing of information. <BR>

<B>HEALTH AND PRODUCT SAFETY </b></center><BR>
<P>Benzene was on the first priority list for risk assessment under the
EU's Existing Substances Regulation. The German rapporteur required that
industry produces the draft risk characterization, and CONCAWE has collaborated
with CEFIC's Aromatic Producers Association Sector and EUROPIA on this project.
Documentation has been provided to the rapporteur who is required to produce
the definitive risk assessment together with any recommendations for risk
management.<BR>
<BR>
The environmental hazard classification of petroleum substances according
to Dangerous Substances Directive criteria is being addressed by the Technical
Progress Committee working party of DG-XI (Environment Directorate). CONCAWE
is working with the European Chemicals Bureau and with representatives from
some Member States to develop proposals for petroleum substances groups,
based both on experimental data and hydrocarbon composition. It is expected
that DG-XI will make decisions on many of the classifications before the
end of this year.<BR>
