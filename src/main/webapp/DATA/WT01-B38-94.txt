<p> <b>20 YEARS OF MEASURING CRIME SHOWS FEWER OFFENSES OVERALL
BUT INCREASED VIOLENCE AGAINST MINORITIES AND THE YOUNG </b> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- After 20 years of asking Americans what
their actual experiences with crime have been, the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) today identified
several long-term trends: </p>

<p> --Overall, the number of criminal victimizations dropped 6
percent since the annual National Crime Victimization Survey
began in 1973. </p>

<p> --The steepest declines are in household burglary and theft.
--Blacks are substantially more likely to be violent crime
victims than are whites. </p>

<p> --Young minority males in central cities are violent crime
victims at the highest rates the survey ever recorded. The data
are from the survey's 20th anniversary report, which noted that
more than 4.4 million interviews were conducted from 1973 through
last year. &quot;While the overall trends are positive, some
groups of Americans are disproportionately the victims of
increasing crime,&quot; observed Lawrence A. Greenfeld, the
acting BJS director. &quot;For example, last year blacks
experienced the highest per capita rates of violent crime in the
survey's history.&quot; &quot;The survey also documented the
growing ratio of violent crime,&quot; Greenfeld pointed out.
&quot;In 1973 about 15 percent of all crimes were violent
compared to 20 percent in 1992. Moreover, about a third of all
victims of violence report an injury.&quot; During the last two
decades an estimated 37 million victims were injured, and more
than one-third of those injured had no health insurance or were
not eligible for public health benefits. Among other report
highlights: </p>

<p> --Handguns are used in about 10 percent of all violent
crimes. Handgun crime rates are above the 1986 low but have not
returned to the highest rate reached in 1982. </p>

<p> --During 1991 an estimated $19.1 billion were lost directly
from personal and household crimes. </p>

<p> --Males are much more likely to be victims of violence
inflicted by strangers than by family members or other close
associates, whereas females are as likely to be hurt by family
members and close associates as by strangers. </p>

<p> --About 30 percent of all violent crimes and 25 percent of
home burglaries occur when the victim or victims are away from
home on a leisure activity. </p>

<p> --In approximately half of all female rapes the victim knew
the offender. Strangers used some type of weapon in 29 percent of
the offenses, compared to 17 percent by non-stranger rapists. </p>

<p> --In robberies during which the offender threatened the
victim before the attack, those victims who defended themselves
in some way were less likely to lose property but were more
likely to be injured than were victims who took no action. When
the offender had a handgun, the victim was seriously injured in 1
percent of the incidents in which self- protective measures were
not taken, compared to 7 percent when such action was taken. </p>

<p> --Households earning more than $30,000 annually are generally
more likely than are households in most other income categories
to experience theft of a motor vehicle, but as household income
rises, burglary rates fall. </p>

<p> --Black male teenagers (that is boys and young men from 12
through 19 years old) are more likely to be violent crime victims
than any other group of people. Their average annual rate is 113
victimizations per 1,000 residents--or almost one in nine black
teenagers. For white male teenagers the rate was 90 per 1,000--or
about one in 11. </p>

<p> --For adult black males (35 through 64 years) the violent
victimization rate was 35 per 1,000. For adult white males, 18
per 1,000; adult white females, 15; adult black females 13;
elderly (65 years or more) black males 12; elderly black females,
10; elderly white males, 6 and elderly white females, 3 per
1,000. The rate of criminal victimizations for all U.S. residents
compared to other life experiences is as follows: </p>

<p> Occurrences Yearly rate per 1,000 adults </p>

<p> Accidental injury, all circumstances 220 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at home 66 </p>

<p> Personal theft 61 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at work 47 </p>

<p> Violent victimization 31 </p>

<p> Assault (aggravated and simple) 25 </p>

<p> Motor vehicle accident injury 22 </p>

<p> Death, all causes 11 </p>

<p> Victimization with injury 11 </p>

<p> Aggravated assault 8 </p>

<p> Robbery 6 </p>

<p> Death from heart disease 5 </p>

<p> Death from cancer 3 </p>

<p> Rape (women only) 1 </p>

<p> Accidental death, all circumstances 0.4 </p>

<p> Death from pneumonia or influenza 0.4 </p>

<p> Death in motor vehicle accident 0.2 </p>

<p> Suicide 0.2 </p>

<p> Death from HIV infection 0.1 </p>

<p> Homicide and capital punishment executions 0.1 </p>

<p> The survey measures rape, robbery, assault, burglary,
personal and household larceny and motor vehicle theft. It does
not measure murder, kidnapping or commercial crimes. </p>

<p> Last year 39 percent of all these crimes were reported to
police--the highest since 1973, when it was 32 percent. The
increased reporting rate was consistent with the fact that
violent crime and motor vehicle theft have made up an increasing
proportion of total crime during the last two decades. The
highest reporting rate last year was for completed motor vehicle
theft--92 percent. The lowest was for personal larceny without
contact--15 percent. </p>
