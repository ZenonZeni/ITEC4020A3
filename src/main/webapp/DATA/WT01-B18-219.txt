On Sept. 29, 1993, the Big Three automakers committed to
developing a triple-efficiency "clean car" prototype
within a decade. A really efficient car, however, can't
be made by pursuing incremental refinements to a
fundamentally obsolete concept of the automobile. A
leapfrog is needed, is now feasible, and can far surpass
the 1993 goal. Striking technological innovations have
been made that, artfully integrated, can yield safe,
affordable and otherwise superior cars getting hundreds
of miles per gallon.
<P>
Accelerating today's heavy steel cars requires engines
so large that their efficiency is halved: only 15-20
percent of the gasoline's energy is available to move
the car, and only 1 percent available to move the
driver. Almost all of the lost power heats the tires and
road, the brakes, and the air pushed aside by the car.
<P>
The key to the super-efficient "hypercar" is first to
make it ultralight. Advanced composite materials can cut
total weight three- to four-fold while improving safety.
Sleeker streamlining can cut aerodynamic drag while
better tires and lowered weight will reduce tire and
road loss. Once this ultralight strategy has largely
eliminated unrecoverable energy losses, the remaining
loss of wheelpower is braking. But if the wheels are
driven by special electric motors, those motors can act
as electronic brakes that convert motion back into
useful electricity. 
<P>
A long driving range can then be achieved by burning any
liquid or gaseous fuel, in a tiny onboard engine or
other powerplant, to make electricity to run the
wheel-motors. 
A few batteries can temporarily store and reuse
recovered braking energy. This "hybrid" technology
combines the best of gasoline and electric cars.
<P>
Combining these approaches yields extraordinary
synergies. Adding hybrid-electric drive to an ordinary
production car increases its efficiency by one-third to
one-half. Making an ordinary car ultralight doubles its
efficiency. But doing both together can boost a car's
efficiency by about tenfold.
