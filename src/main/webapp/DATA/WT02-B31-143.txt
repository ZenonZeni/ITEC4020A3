<STRONG>What it Can Do for You</STRONG><BR>


Let's face it - you work hard for your money, and that's why you need your money to
work hard
for you. 
Of course, income tax is a fact of life - and it's not something you have a great
deal of
control over. 
However, there is a way to accumulate money without having to pay taxes on it - at
least not
until you
use it.  It's called tax deferral, and several types of insurance and financial
products
offer it.
<P>
<STRONG>What is Tax Deferral?</STRONG><BR>
With tax-deferred products, you don't pay taxes on accumulated funds, interest or
dividends
until you
actually withdraw the money. Since the gain in a tax-deferred product isn't taxed
until it's
withdrawn, it
usually accumulates at a faster rate.  For this reason, tax-deferred accumulation
can provide
a powerful
financial edge.
<P>
If you participate in a 401(k) plan offered by your employer or if you own an
Individual
Retirement
Account (IRA), you're already enjoying the benefits of tax-deferred accumulation. 
Many
insurance and
annuity products also offer this advantage.  Even the interest and dividends
generated by
these
products generally avoid current income taxes!
<P>
<STRONG>The Power of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
The following chart shows the tremendous difference tax deferral can make in the
rate at
which your
money grows.  If we assume that a single sum of $50,000 will be invested for 30
years at a
hypothetical
interest rate of 8%, we see that the tax-deferred vehicle provides better long-term
accumulation.  If you
are in the 31% tax bracket, you may be able to accumulate about $250,620 in a
taxable
account. 
However, if you used a tax-deferred account for the same investment, you may
accumulate over
$503,100.  (Please note that a 10% IRS tax penalty may be imposed on withdrawals
from
annuities,
some insurance products, IRAs, or 401(k) plans, when these withdrawals are made
before the
purchaser has reached age 59 1/2.)

<P>



<STRONG>Let it Accumulate</STRONG><BR>
Tax-deferred products offer you control over your financial situation.  Not only
does your
money
accumulate but, if you are selective in your withdrawals and plan them accordingly,
you can
avoid
getting "hit" with too many tax consequences when you do withdraw the money. 
Here's why:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Tax deferral strategies work best for long-term planning, usually retirement
planning.
The idea is to
leave the money where it is for a long time - to let it go and let it grow. Sure
you'll be
taxed on the money
you start to withdraw after you've retired - but you may be in a lower tax bracket
by then,
which would
serve to soften the tax blow.

<LI>You can be selective in your withdrawals and plan them so that you do not
suffer
unnecessary tax
consequences. The tax system has "thresholds" (tax brackets) that will help you
determine how
much
of these funds you can withdraw during a given year. If you are prudent with your
withdrawals
- and you
don't break into a higher tax threshold - then the effect of these withdrawals on
your taxes
will be
minimal. Remember, you're only taxed on what you withdraw.
</OL>
<P>
<STRONG>Tax-Deferred Insurance Products</STRONG><BR>
The cash values in life insurance and annuities accumulate tax deferred.  An
annuity offers
you
protection so you don't outlive your savings.  It does this by generating a steady
stream of
income that
will be taxed as you receive it - a little at a time. As for whole life insurance,
the main
feature is the death
benefit protection it provides, but it also offers the additional benefit of cash
accumulation.  (Note:
Another major tax advantage of life insurance is that, in most instances, the
payout to your
beneficiaries
is income tax free!)  
<P>

For people who want to combine tax deferral with the potential growth from a
diversified portfolio, there are variable universal life insurance and variable
annuity
plans. Both of these
offer the opportunity to participate in investment accounts - and the associated
higher level
of risk.
However, like all tax-deferred products, they accumulate gradually over time. That
is why
insurance and
annuity products - like most tax-deferred vehicles -  may work best as long-term
funding
vehicles.
<P>
Only you can determine what your financial needs are - right now and later in 
your life. But it's important to remember that sooner or later, many of us can
benefit from tax-deferred products. Talk to your New York Life insurance agent or
your NYLIFE Securities registered representative, and examine your needs -- not
just your immediate goals but your long-term goals. You'll see whether tax-deferred
products could be right for you.<P>
