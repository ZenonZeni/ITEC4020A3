<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Reform Efforts in Teaching Mathematics</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#CS">Corinne Schaeffer</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
Here you will find an attempt to highlight the nature of the changes occurring in mathematics classrooms at all levels (elementary, secondary, and post-secondary) across the country.  Although not all attempts at reform are identical in nature, the following describes the basic principles on which most reforms are at least partly, if not completely, based.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Changes in Student Involvement</H4>

For many years, students have been expected to learn a set of procedures for solving specific problems in mathematics without necessarily being expected to understand the concepts underlying these procedures.  As stated in <I>Everybody Counts</I>, "there is no place in a proper curriculum for mindless mimicry mathematics" (p. 44).  Instead, mathematics educators are being challenged to prepare students for today's world by helping students attain <i>mathematical power</i> which is defined as the "abilities to explore, conjecture, and reason logically, as well as the ability to use a variety of mathematical methods effectively to solve nonroutine problems" (NCTM, 1989, p. 5).<BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, students are exposed to fundamental concepts and procedures before introducing any applications.  An underlying principle of the <I>Standards</I> reverses this order.  Students are now being asked to become engaged in purposeful problem solving activities in which they must make decisions, use <A HREF="MathTech">technology</A> when appropriate, and communicate their results either verbally or in writing or both.  It is then expected that the mathematical knowledge will be uncovered as a result of the activity.  The following is a list of five general goals for students established by NCTM:<BR> 
<OL>
<LI>Learning to value mathematics.<BR>
<LI>Becoming confident in one's own ability. <BR>
<LI>Becoming a mathematical problem solver. <BR>
<LI>Learning to communicate mathematically. <BR>
<LI>Learning to reason mathematically.  (NCTM, 1989, p. 5)<BR> 
</OL>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Changes in Pedagogy</H4>

Clearly the role of the teacher in this new approach to teaching and learning must also change.  Instead of planning a well versed explanation of a topic, complete with examples to illustrate typical exercises to be encountered by students, the teacher is now responsible for devising <A HREF=" http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/math/ma300.htm">meaningful activities</A> for students to investigate.  In addition to creating (or finding and modifying) such activities, the teacher must provide assistance and opportunities for student reflection.  The main goal here is to structure the classroom to promote <B>active</B> learning on the part of the students.     

Teachers may be involved in direct instruction on occasion, but this is no longer the predominant mode of teaching since it typically promotes relatively passive learning on the part of the student.  According to the NCTM, "the image of mathematics teaching needed includes elementary and secondary teachers who are more proficient in --<BR>
<UL>
<LI>selecting mathematical tasks to engage students' interests and intellect;
<LI>providing opportunities to deepen their understanding of the mathematics being studied and its applications;
<LI>orchestrating classroom discourse in ways that promote the investigation and growth of mathematical ideas;
<LI>using, and helping students use, <A HREF="MathTech">technology</A> and other tools to pursue mathematical investigations;
<LI>seeking, and helping students seek, connections to previous and developing knowledge;
<LI>guiding individual, <A HREF="../Coop/Coop.home">small-group, and whole-class work</A>.  (NCTM, 1991, p. 1)
