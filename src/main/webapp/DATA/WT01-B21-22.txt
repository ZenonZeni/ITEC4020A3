<h1>Marijuana as Antiemetic Medicine: </h1>

<p><b>A Survey of Oncologists' Experiences and Attitudes</b> </p>

<p><b>by Richard Doblin and Mark A. R. Kleiman</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><b>Abstract: </b>A random-sample anonymous survey of the
members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was
conducted in the spring of 1990 measuring the attitudes and
experiences of American oncologists concerning the antiemetic use
of marijuana in cancer chemotherapy patients. The survey was
mailed to about one-third (N = 2430) of all U.S.-based ASCO
members and yielded a response rate of 43% (1035). More than 44%
of the respondents report recommending the (illegal) use of
marijuana for the control of emesis to at least one cancer
chemotherapy patient. Almost half (48%) would prescribe marijuana
to some of their patients if it were legal. As a group,
respondents considered (smoked) marijuana to be somewhat more
effective than the legally available (oral) synthetic THC
(Marinol) and roughly as safe. Of the respondents who expressed
an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be
available by prescription. </p>

<p>These results bear on the question of whether marijuana has a
&quot;currently accepted medical use,&quot; an issue in an
ongoing administrative and legal dispute concerning whether
marijuana in smoked form should be available by prescription
along with synthetic THC in oral form. This survey demonstrates
that oncologists' experience with the medical use of marijuana is
more extensive, and their opinions of it more favorable, than the
regulatory authorities appear to have believed. </p>
