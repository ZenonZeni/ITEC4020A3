</H1><P>











<P><B>The homeless are everywhere and nowhere. In a nation that prides itself
on keeping statistics about every conceivable economic activity, it is remarkable





















that there is no reliable data on the extent of homelessness.  </B>












<P><B>	Everyone agrees that homelessness started a dramatic increase in the
1970s and 1980s. Republican Jack Kemp, former chairman of the Interagency
Council on the Homeless said, "Today's homelessness started to become a highly





















visible and recognized problem in many cities in the late 1970s and early
1980s."  In the 1950s and 1960s seeing a homeless person was indeed a rarity.
Now it seems you trip over them even in the best of neighborhoods.</B>












<P><B>	Who are the homeless?  Three-quarters of the homeless are single men.





















Nearly half of them are veterans. Most of these vets were once productive





















blue-collar workers who were laid off either by "downsizing" or because of
the relocation of plants overseas.</B>












<P><B>	Homelessness is next to joblessness and both are caused by our massive





















trade deficits.  In the early 1970s we did not have a trade deficit--our
exports and imports were nearly equal.  We also did not have a massive





















homelessness problem.  And then the floodgates opened.  Until 1973 we did
not trade with China at all.  We had a small trade deficit with Japan then
as the first waves of Toyotas, Hondas and Datsuns were invading our shores
in small battalions.</B>












<P><B>	The vast rise in our trade deficit is mirrored by an alarming rise
in the homeless population. Now families are joining shelters where only
males used to flee. It used to be that an American with a high school degree





















could get a decent  job with a predictable future and buy a decent home.
 Now, alarmingly, home ownership is declining for the first time in American





















history. Many of us are only one paycheck away from poverty and from losing
our homes or apartments.  Ten thousand Americans are losing their homes to





















foreclosure every month and many times that number are thrown out onto the





















streets by court-ordered evictions.</B>












<P><B>	Homelessness is one of the hidden costs of the trade wars. When American





















consumers buy cheap Chinese shoes, Malaysian clothing and Taiwanese electronics





















we are also buying unemployment and homelessness in America.  Besides losing
jobs and homes, we lose tax revenues and drain our unemployment funds.  Why
do you think that we have had federal budget deficits for the last two decades?





















 Because we are losing our tax base.  Incomes have not increased in twenty
years, they have actually declined.  We are the only major nation to suffer
this fate, so I do not blame international trade alone.  I blame the American





















government and the trade negotiators for getting us bad trade agreements
and by failing to enforce our own trade and tariff laws.</B>












<P><B>	For example, federal law provides that imported trucks are subject
to a 25% duty.  Cars are subject to a duty of only 2.5%.  The Japan lobby
has succeeded in having Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and Izusu trucks and minivans





















classified as cars for duty purposes, but as trucks for safety and other





















purposes.  The British-made Range Rover pulled the Shetland wool over somebody's





















eyes when it convinced the feds that its $60,000 off-road vehicles were trucks
in order to escape the luxury tax, but were cars to escape the truck duty.
 It should be the other way around--Rovers are certainly luxury vehicles
and should be taxed as such, and they are trucks for duty purposes.  Each
Rover should bring the federal government $10,000 or more in revenues but
brings in only about $1,000.  When Range Rovers cost a mere $40,000, Murphy
Brown said it more sense to buy a Ford Explorer and strap $20,000 in cash
to the hood--you would get the same effect.</B>












<P><B>	By circumventing import duties these imported trucks not only cost





















American jobs they cost the U.S. treasury $1.2 billion dollars annually.
 I estimate that we could build 30,000 homes for the homeless (at $40,000
each) with these revenues.  This in turn would create tens of thousands of
jobs for plumbers, carpenters, masons and others.</B>












<P><B>	Foreign corporations have found countless ways for dodging American
taxes.  Japanese and European corporations set up importing subsidiaries
in this country: Toyota of America, Mercedes Benz of North America and so
forth.  Most of these foreign corporations pay little or no income tax in
the United States.  They do this slight-of-hand trick by claiming that they
make no income here by overcharging their own subsidiaries.  Their accountants





















miraculously transfer profits back to Tokyo or Munich or London.  The Internal





















Revenue Service has tried unsuccessfully to go after these companies because
many Japanese parent corporations refuse to turn over documents to the U.S.





















government.  President Clinton promised to close this gaping loophole, but
has not done so thus far.  This loophole costs American taxpayers tens of





















billions of dollars every year, strengthens our trade opponents and makes





















balancing the U.S. budget that much harder.   </B>












<P><B>	Without changing our laws, just by enforcing existing laws, we can
turn the trade war around.  The symptoms of our trade deficits are everywhere
to be found.  Next time you see a homeless person, let him inspire you to
write your congressman or the president and strengthen your desire to buy
only American products. Most homeless people are casualties of our trade
wars and should be constant reminders that we are in a battle for economic





















survival.</B>
