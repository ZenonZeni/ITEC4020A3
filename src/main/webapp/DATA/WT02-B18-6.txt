<H2>Tagua Initiative&#174  Fact Sheet</H2>
</CENTER> 

<P>
In concert with the Foundation for Research and Capacity Building for Socio-Environmental Development (CIDESA), an Ecuadoran nonprofit institution, CI has linked rural harvesters of the ivory-like nut of the tagua palm with button,  jewelry, and carving manufacturers around the world. 
<P>
The Tagua Initiative is designed to help protect the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, one of the world's most diverse rain forest "<A HREF="../../fieldact/hotspots/hotspots.htm">hot spots,</A>" while demonstrating the viability of a new model for conservation. In this model, international businesses form partnerships with local producer groups. In doing so, they create the incentives that local people need to save forests, rather than cutting them down.

<H3>Accomplishments of the Tagua Initiative</H3>
</CENTER> 

<LI>Creation of a local enterprise in Comuna Rio Santiago Cayapas, Ecuador, to sell tagua nuts directly to Ecuadorian factories that process them into button blanks and jewelry components for export around the world. 
<BR>

<LI>Training of 20 community members in accounting, management, and product sales to run this local enterprise. Participation of 350 local families - over 1,300 people in the Initiative in Ecuador. 
<BR>

<LI>Sales of more than 2,000 tons of tagua nuts to Ecuadoran factories.  The amount of tagua sold in 1994 increased by 50% over 1993.
<BR>

<LI>Creation of a cottage industry to produce hand-carved buttons.  This community enterprise has sold over 45,000 hand-carved buttons internationally, and forecasts its production for this year to produce and sell 20,000 additional units in the U.S. and Japan.
<BR>

<LI><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/CED/Handnut.jpg" ALT="Handnut.jpg - 8.2 K" WIDTH=207 HEIGHT=136 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>Sales of over 36 million buttons by 4 TI-licensed international button distributors.  In the past year, button sales totaled more than 10 million units. <BR>

<LI>Expansion of the Tagua Initiative from one product (buttons) in one country (Ecuador) in October 1990 to more than 20 products in 8 countries today.  Over the next year, the TI will be formalizing several new marketing partnerships with wholesalers and retailers in Japan and Europe.
<BR>

<LI>Creation of strategic alliances between the TI and the Keidanren and JAIDO of Japan.  This unique partnership has been crucial in laying the groundwork for solid expansion and advancement of the TI. 
<BR> 

<LI>Design and implementation of scientific and socio-economic studies to monitor the effect and success of the Initiative in terms of biodiversity protection and local benefit.
<BR>

<LI>Development of environmental education programs for local communities.
<BR>
</UL>

Over the past year, the TI has received special recognition for its unique work: 

<UL>
<LI>Partnerships for Change: An international conference hosted by the government of England, as a follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, highlighted the TI as a premier example of sustainable development. A key publicity event which gave the TI international recognition, the conference was attended by over 350 participants from over 80 countries. The TI was one of eight case studies chosen to promote successful experiences in sustainable development. 

<LI>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):  UNEP  launched a major initiative for worldwide publication of sustainability case studies. The paper was distributed at the UNEP conference in June of 1994, and the resulting publication was sent to over 7,000 individuals and groups worldwide. 
</UL>

<P>
During the last six months, special emphasis has been placed on building facilities to increase local processing capacity, and therefore added value locally.  The community enterprise workers have built five production centers that will allow them to process more nuts, which will lead to increased revenues locally. 
<P>
The Tagua Initiative has had great success in the marketing of its message. At present, TI tagua buttons are used by over 30 well-known garment manufacturers.  Tagua jewelry and carvings are available internationally by <A HREF="../../../CED/PRODUCTS/Markfram.htm">retail and mail order</A>.  Furthermore, the project has benefited greatly from coverage by <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I>, <I>National Geographic</I>, <I>ABC News</I>, <I>CNN</I>, <I>BBC,</I> and <I>Radio France</I>, as well as dozens of other media outlets.
