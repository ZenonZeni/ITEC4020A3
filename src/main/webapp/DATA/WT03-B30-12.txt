Poc Contact Carla Pickering, Purchasing Agent, (801) 524-3555, 
Technical Contact, Bob Norman (970) 248-0634 This procurement is a 
attempt to sole source to Lotek Engineering Inc. Lotek Engineering has 
developed a digitally encoded radio system that has the design features 
unavailable from other manufacturers. The encoding system use a pulse 
coded design that allows up to 100 tags to be used simultaneously per 
frequency. Under this system, qualification of codes by pulse width is 
no longer necessary, thus enhancing the ability to accurately identify 
each individual fish. The power savings inherent in this design is used 
for: higher peak outputs (thereby increasing range) and producing a 
smaller size tag with longer operational life. Using the smallest tag 
available (with maximum range of tag life) is essential when implanting 
these tags in endangered fish. Another advantage of this encoding 
design is the use of different pulse codes under one frequency 
eliminates sequential scanning of different frequencies; therefore, 
increasing accuracy by eliminating delays in scan time. The pulse coded 
radio system has features critical to the application at Redlands Fish 
Ladder. Lotek Engineering Inc., is the only manufacturer of this type 
of equipment. ITEM NO. 1. SRX_400*, Configuration #3C Telemetry

is reached (i.e., this acceleration is expected to be 20 seconds). The 
bottom fin on the missile will be placed in an evaporator up 
configuration requiring the the working fluid to wick up against 
gravity. Little maneuvering is anticipated until the final few seconds 
of flight.  There must be an axial hole 0.0159 m diameter, though the 
heat pipe for an actuation rod. Operating temperature: 800-900K, wall 
material: 304 stainless steel, working fluid: sodium, configuration 
shape: NACA 0015 (C = 0.1143m), wall thickness: 0.0023m, evaporator 
length: 0.050m, input power: 3,186 W@ Te = 850K, total fin lenght:  
0.254m, acceleration field: short duration 3g, evaporator location:
