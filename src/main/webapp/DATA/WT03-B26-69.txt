<H4>2. APPLICATIONS DEMANDING ATTENTION</H4>
Applications using images which have wide scan angles or are captured when
the sun and observer positions are such that these angular variations are
significant must take them into account or correct the images for them in
some way. Examples are: 
<UL>
<LI>Single scenes where classification and other image processing is predicated
on consistent values from similar target land or water types; 
<LI>Mosaics of images which are intended to produce a consistent composite
image on which spectral (location independent) image processing can be done;
and 
<LI>Multiple images, such as time series where the data must be compared
for change in the surface that must be detectable over changes due to image
brightness differences within and/or between images. 
</UL>
In a sense, the objective is to ensure a spatial and temporal 'stationarity'
in which a given target with given unchanging reflectance will be the same
at all locations and in all images over the time series. Obviously, the
degree to which this needs to be accomplished depends on the application,
and the value of spending time and effort on image correction depends on
the value put on the final product by the client.<BR>
<BR>
From the economic perspective, there will always be 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. project planning and management costs;<BR>
2. image and ancillary data acquisition costs;<BR>
3. data base processing costs;<BR>
4. value adding costs;<BR>
5. data integration costs; and<BR>
6. product presentation costs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The total cost must reflect the value of the product to the end user. If
the emphasis is on low costs the effort justified by correcting for, or
using, effects like image brightness variations may be small. On the other
hand, if the accuracy of the product is crucial and the value of the information
is high then extra effort in correcting for image brightness may be fully
justified. In the face of this, there are a range of approaches and methods
that can be used to model or correct the type of brightness variations described
above. Which among them is 'best' will depend on the application and value
of the data.<BR>
