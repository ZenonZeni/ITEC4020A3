Most <i>good</i> natural resources funds actually beat the TSE Gold index, possibly due to some oil related investments, or to some smart trading. Funds like <i>BGR Precious Metals</i> took smaller losses than some funds and are actually seeing a price recovery. One fund that took substantial losses was <i>Global Strategy Divers. Gold</i>, which lost about 25% in the last six weeks. However, since the start of 1996, both BGR and Global Strategy are <i>still ahead</i> by between 45 and 50%. Investing is a tough game, even if you win big (and 50% return in six months is winning BIG)!. Somehow, we always count the drop from the all-time high as money lost, but we don't count capital losses to our portfolio unless we actually sell our investments. It's a funny world.<p><b>Charts on the TSE Gold, Paper and Forest and the TSE Resources 100 Index all show an</b> <b>intermediate term bottom and an (oversold) rally developing.</b> <b>This fits in</b> <b>with a similar pattern forming in the TSE 300.</b> However, the TSE Oil and Gas indices are still near the top of their trading range. Also, the long term channel that has enclosed the trading action on the TSE Mines/Metals index looks to be teetering on the edge of a breakdown. The Mines chart may recover, if the rest of the markets pick up momentum. We'll have to wait and see on that one.<p>My chart showing the spread ratio between London Gold and the TSE Gold Index shows that the ratio has dropped from an overpriced 35:1 ratio down to about 28:1. This means that some of the excess pricing in gold stocks has been blown out. A ratio of 28:1 isn't great, because in the past six years, the ratio has been as low as 15:1. However, there is a built-in inflation factor at work, or more accurately-an investor inflation expectation. The growth in the Bullion vs TSE Gold ratio compares similarly with the growth in price action of the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index, our consumer inflation indicator. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/goldvbul.gif">TSE Gold Bullion<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold Index<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metals<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>40</center></body></html>
