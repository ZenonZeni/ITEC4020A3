The field of gifted education has been, for many years, a laboratory for the development of creative educational enrichment activities.  Critical thinking, problem-finding, and problem-solving activites, for example, were originated by professionals working in gifted education.  Recently these creative activities have been used successfully in heterogeneous classrooms, and teachers have found that the activities are highly stimulating for general education populations.  The abstracts included here are typical examples of activities that were designed for gifted students, and may also be useful for general education populations.  In addition, the AskERIC Virtual Library provides a <a href=gopher://ericir.syr.edu/11/Lesson>searchable database</a> of lesson plans that were designed for gifted students and may also be appropriate for all students.<P>

  Too often, gifted programs offer standard, all-purpose enrichment without 
regard to special talents.  Talents are not usually fully developed in 
youngsters.  Teachers can help develop children's talent by becoming talent 
scouts, structuring appropriate learning activities, praising talented 
behavior, helping kids set learning goals, locating helpful resources, and 
enlisting parents' support.  (10 references) (MLH)<BR>

  A differentiated curriculum can provide the basis for discovering, serving, 
and nurturing academic talent across California's diverse student population.  
Differentiation provides tools to vary the curriculum or instruction so that 
students who have already mastered given material continue to progress and 
students who have a particular interest in an area can pursue it in greater 
depth or in a personalized way.  Although aimed at gifted and talented 
youngsters, four principles of differentiation can be used to meet the needs of 
all students.  These include acceleration, complexity, depth, and novelty.  The 
responsibility for differentiation is one which all educators must share, at 
the classroom level and the school level.  Educators must develop a new vision 
of excellence that depends on a fresh understanding of how the core curriculum 
can be differentiated to provide advanced learning opportunities.  The 
education of the most able students, as with all students, is best developed in 
challenging contexts which shift the emphasis from the structure of the program 
to the quality of the curriculum.  The core curriculum currently embodied in 
California's curriculum frameworks is often described as a "thinking 
curriculum" because it tries to engage students at all times in the search for 
meaning.  In addition to differentiation at the classroom level, successful 
differentiation at the school level involves new service models, new roles for 
educators, shared resources, improved assessment practices, and ongoing staff 
development.  (JDD)<BR>

  This presentation summarizes effective strategies and programs for nurturing 
students who are gifted in science.  A smorgasbord of educationally 
accelerative opportunities is recommended, to enhance students' potential for 
future development in science.  These opportunities may include field trips, 
advanced placement courses, and science summer camps.  Experiences that promote 
science achievement are described, such as simultaneous teaching of separate 
science subjects.  Models for encouraging scientific development, such as early 
entrance to college and contests/competitions, are cited.  Recommendations are 
offered for nurturing talent in science and technology.  Recommendations relate 
to the topics of identification, science curriculum, and teachers/mentors.

  The paper describes a curriculum model developed for gifted and talented 
students in an integrated middle school program, as a cooperative effort 
between the College of Education at the University of Houston and a Houston 
middle school.  The program includes identification procedures, curriculum 
practices, and evaluation techniques.  The curriculum is intended to be both 
differentiated and interdisciplinary.  The curriculum consists of subject 
matter in eight areas: math, science, social studies, language arts, music, 
art, computer technology, and Spanish.  Teachers become teachers/advisors in 
the program and assist students in individual and group activities according to 
student interest and subject area proficiency.  Results of the initial 5-year 
pilot phase and a refined pilot phase indicated that students developed 
independent study skills and decision-making strategies.  Teaching teams 
developed 3-week study guides for each subject area and for interdisciplinary 
areas.  These brief guides identify topics, subtopics, essential curriculum 
elements, a selection of activities, an evaluation process, and suggested 
references.  Seven study guides are attached.  (DB)<BR>
