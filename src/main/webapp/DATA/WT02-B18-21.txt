<TR><TD valign=top width=50%><H2>New Primate Species<BR>
Discovered in Brazil
</H2>

 
Washington, D.C.: The Amazonian rain forest has revealed 
a new biological treasure: The newest marmoset species, Callithrix saterei, a squirrel-sized primate, was discovered in the Brazilian Amazon in 1993. Named for an indigenous group living near the site of the discovery, the Satere marmoset is distinguished from its close relatives by such features as unpigmented skin on its face and ears, and burnt-orange color fur on its body. 
	<P>"Finding a new beetle in the rain forest may not be surprising, but a new primate species is extraordinary," said Russell A. Mittermeier, CI President and Chairman of the Primate Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC). "This discovery attests to the vast diversity of life on earth that remains unknown to us and shows how ignorant we still are of our fellow species -- even a well-studied group such as primates."
	<P>The Satere marmoset is the sixth new monkey species found in Brazil since 1990, raising the count of Brazil’s primate species to 75 -- more than double the number found in Indonesia, Madagascar, or Zaire. These four nations account for 66 percent of the 275 nonhuman primate species found in 92 countries worldwide. Brazil alone accounts for 27 percent of the total.
	<P>"As scientists continue to explore undisturbed tracts of Amazonian forest, I wouldn’t be surprised if we found another five monkeys by the year 2000," said Dr. Mittermeier.
	<P>The scientifc description of the marmoset, supported by CI, appeared in the Brazilian journal Goeldiana.

<H3>CD Players in the Rain Forest</H3>
<P>
Washington, DC: The late Ted Parker attained legendary stature among birders for his ability to identify the calls of more than 4,000 species of birds. As part of the ornithological surveys he conducted in his years of Neotropical research, Parker would pre-record tapes -- and then play back the calls to attract individual birds in his vicinity. Using this technique, he was able to census the majority of bird species inhabiting a targeted geographic range.
	

<P>To make these resources available to field biologists, CI and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology’s Library of Natural Sounds are collaborating on a compact-disc set of 300 recorded bird calls from the lowland region of southeastern Peru. Over half the recordings were made by Parker, whose collection of nearly 10,000 bird calls 
is housed at Cornell.
	
<P>"This tool is still in the testing stage, but we hope it will dramatically speed up the process of cataloging the world’s uncharted bird diversity," said Tom Schulenberg, leader of CI’s Rapid Assessment Program and ornithologist with the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.  "The CD will place the hard-won knowledge of brilliant ornithologists like Parker at the fingertips of the new generation of field scientists."




<A NAME="water"></A><H3>Water Pipeline Poses New Threat <BR>to Okavango Delta</H3>
Maun, Botswana: Namibia is in the grip of a severe drought, threatening the country’s water supply. To avert a water crisis in the capital city of Windhoek, the Namibian govern-ment is proposing to run a pipeline from the Okavango River, as soon as funding can be secured from international donors. Conservationists say that large-scale extractions via this pipeline will upset the delicate water cycle of Botswana’s Okavango Delta, which is already at its 
lowest level in decades.
	

<P>"Water development schemes -- in Namibia, Angola, and Botswana -- pose one of the greatest threats to the future of the Okavango Delta," said Lee Hannah, CI’s Director for Africa. Over the past ten months, conservationists have confronted several new threats to the delta, including a series of veterinary fences erected to prevent the spread of a contagious disease among cattle, and Namibia’s proposal for water withdrawal, which is being planned at a greatly accelerated rate. 
	
<P>"Any shift in the region’s water-use patterns will have an impact on the delta’s fragile ecology," said Karen Ross, Director of CI’s Okavango Delta Program. "It’s critical for the nations of the region to agree to significant limits on water withdrawal from the Okavango River to ensure the natural functioning of the delta ecosystem."
	
<P>The Okavango Delta, one of Africa’s greatest wetlands regions, is replenished each year by the food tide of the Okavango River. This food peak sustains the flora and fauna of the Okavango wetlands, and ultimately provides a livelihood to indigenous peoples.
	

<P>But the foods have been small for the past five years. This year, they have yet to reach the town of Maun, whose river has been dry for ten months.
 	

<P>"CI’s chief concern is to ensure the integrity of the Okavango Delta at the same time that its benefts are equitably shared," said Hannah.  Hannah suggested that Namibia could explore options such as intensifed water recycling, water desalinization, and use of underground water. 
	 

<P>Botswana, Namibia, and Angola took a major step toward coordinated planning of the Okavango with the signing of the Okavango River Basin Water Commission Agreement 
in September 1994. The trinational commission (OKACOM) created by this agreement will recommend developments and investigate the impacts of surface and subsurface water development of the greater Okavango watershed.


<P>"The problem with Namibia’s new proposal is that it preempts the work of OKACOM," said Ross. "Not until OKACOM conducts a thorough river basin management study can the three countries agree on how to regulate water use."

<TD valign=top><H2>Pulsar Pledges $10 Million To<BR>Selva Lacandona Conservation</H2>

Monterrey, Mexico: Pulsar Internacional, S.A. de C.V., one of Mexico’s largest companies, has committed $10 million to CI for conservation activities in the Selva Lacandona region over the next five years. The pledge made by Alfonso Romo, Pulsar’s chairman and CI board member, is the largest private gift ever for conservation efforts in Latin America.
	

<P>The Selva Lacandona --one of the last remaining 
North American rain forests and Mexico’s highest conservation priority -- is under siege. The region has become the scene of intense disputes over access to land, where vying indigenous communities have already come to blows over dwindling resources.
	

<P>With increased competition for land, farmers are rapidly clear-cutting forests for crops and cattle-ranching. According to a study by the Mexican university ECOSUR, there will be no forest left in the state of Chiapas in 
48 years if deforestation continues at its current rate. The combined effects of economic pressures, ecological destruction, and population growth could threaten the stability of the entire region.
	

<P>Through Romo’s grant, CI, Pulsar, and local communities have formed a partnership to defuse the situation. A team of Pulsar engineers and scientists and CI staff will spear-head a new initiative to address the ecological and economic problems confronting the region and develop forest-friendly alternative activities in the Selva Lacandona.
	

<P>Pulsar’s research and development 
institution, the Center for Agricultural Studies, will establish experimental stations to identify improved agricultural techniques for local farmers. In the buffer zone surrounding the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, farmers will learn 
to cultivate new, marketable crops. 
And the grant will reinforce CI’s current projects through environmental education, construction of biological stations, policy initiatives, and microenterprise development. 
	
<P>"At Pulsar, we feel that the conservation of Mexico’s natural resources is of the utmost importance, and we continually seek opportunities to improve our environment as well as our country’s prosperity," said Romo.
	

<P>Pulsar provides literacy and training programs for workers at its Chiapas operations, reflecting the company’s commitment to cultivating the region’s social, economic, and environmental resources. Pulsar’s program will help to stabilize the region and relieve 
the pressures on the already strained ecosystems of the Selva Lacandona. 


<A NAME="tech"></A><H3>Biosphere Reserves Forge Links Through Internet <BR>
and Powerful New Technologies</H3>
<P>	
Chiapas, Mexico: The first Biosphere Reserve Training Workshop in Central America was sponsored by CI, Intel Corporation and the United Nations Educational, Scientifc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in July 1996. The three-week workshop equipped institutions in six biosphere reserves with Internet access, computers, and CI’s conser-vation planning software, and provided intensive training to 13 experts in the use of these systems. The participating reserves included La Amistad in Panama, La Amistad 
in Costa Rica, Maya in Guatemala, Sierra del Rosario in Cuba, and Alto Golfo and Montes Azules in Mexico.
	

<P>The program will allow park managers and researchers to exchange information 
on the Internet and integrate conservation activities with partners on the local, regional, and global levels. "With these technologies, researchers can collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world," said Intel Chairman Gordon Moore. CI will also continue to provide technical support 
to the biosphere reserve network.
	
<P>
The CI-Intel-UNESCO partnership will sponsor a series of biosphere reserve work-shops in Latin America, Asia, and Africa over the next year, including one in South America in September. The world’s 334 biosphere reserves, coordinated by UNESCO since 1976, are protected areas surrounded by buffer zones where scientific research and sustainable development activities are promoted.

<H3>Peru Declares National Park<BR>
in Tambopata Heath Region</H3>

<P>Lima, Peru: The government of Peru established the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes in July 1996, granting permanent protection to some of the most biologically important territory on the planet. The 802,750 acre park includes the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary and a part of Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a tract of Amazonian rain forest harboring extremely high species diversity.
	

The declaration follows over a half-decade of intense work in the region. In 1990, CI’s Rapid Assessment Program documented the rich habitats of Tambopata and identified the area as a top global conservation priority. Since then, CI-Peru has helped bring together local communities, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations on an array of socioeconomic studies and sustainable enterprise projects -- including a successful Brazil nut industry -- to gain their commitment to a protected area.

<P>	
"We see the park as the focus for a social contract between the local people who support this park, conservationists, and the government," said Avecita Chicchón, director of CI’s Peru Program. When CI first began work-ing in this region, local conservationists gained community support for the park proposal in exchange for economic alternatives to destructive land-use practices. 
	

<P>There is still much work to be done. "Creating Bahuaja-Sonene National Park is an important first step 
in setting aside the entire Tambopata Candamo area," said Rod Mast, CI Vice President for the Andes Region. "We are committed to continuing efforts to ensure that 
the entire 5,600 square-mile area eventually achieves national park status."

<A NAME="chall"></A><H3>CI Meets Challenge Grant Goal</H3>

<P>
Washington, DC: CI raised 
$1 million in just three months to complete a challenge grant launched by actor Harrison Ford and Intel Chairman Gordon Moore, both CI board members. 
In March, Ford and Moore pledged to match dollar-for-dollar all unrestricted contributions made to CI by June 30. A total of 1,767 individuals and 30 organizations contributed $1,085,000.

<P>"This exceptional display of commitment to the CI family 
will be instrumental in forging conservation partnerships across the globe," said CI Vice President of Development and Communications Karen Ziffer. "We would like to offer our sincerest thanks to Harrison, Gordon, and everyone who joined in this challenge."

<H3>Conservation Leader Joins CI Papua <BR>
New Guinea Staff</H3>

<P>
Port Moresby, PNG: Gai Kula, one of the foremost conservationists in Papua New Guinea, has become CI’s new program director based in that country. Since 1992, Kula has been First Assistant Secretary for Nature Conservation in PNG’s Department of Environment and Conservation, where he was responsible for all govern-ment biodiversity programs. "Gai is a visionary," said CI President Russell A. Mittermeier. "He was one of the first officials in PNG to recognize biodiversity conservation as an essential ingredient in his country’s overall development strategy."

<P>
With more than 21 years in PNG’s wildlife management program, Kula has become one of the chief architects of the region’s biodiversity policy. In the last few years, he has led IUCN’s Regional Council for the Pacific and chaired the Global Environment Facility Consultative Working Group.

<P>PNG is the most biologically diverse country in the Pacific region and one of the world’s top 15 megadiversity countries, housing some of the world’s greatest expanses of tropical rain forest and coral reefs. These riches are being squandered as logging activ-ities spread: Between 1980 and 1993 annual wood exports from PNG quadrupled from 642,000 cubic meters of logs to 2.7 million cubic meters -- equal to about three million trees.
