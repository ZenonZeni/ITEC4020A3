<p><b>What Treatment is Available for Anorexia Nervosa?</b> </p>
<p>Our inpatient facility <a href="Unitdata.htm">provides treatment</a> for women from ages 16 through 45 who meet 
<a href="diagAnor.htm">diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa</a>. The average length of stay is three to four 
months. Treatment is multi-disciplinary and consists of nutritional management, group and 
individual psychotherapy, and behavioral interventions geared towards normalizing eating 
behavior and weight. Patients are placed on a well-balanced diet and their weight is 
gradually restored to a normal range (90% of <a href="metropol.htm">expected body weight</a> and above). 
Psychotherapy is used to treat emotional problems associated with the eating disorder as 
well as to help restructure distorted thoughts about eating and weight. </p>
<p>Treatment is offered at <strong>no cost</strong> in exchange for participation in ongoing research studies. 
Currently this entails participating in a seven week trial of fluoxetine, a widely used 
antidepressant medication, during the inpatient stay. Upon discharge, patients who 
received treatment on the inpatient unit may be eligible to receive up to one year of free 
outpatient psychotherapy as part of our investigation of relapse prevention in the treatment 
of anorexia nervosa. </p>
