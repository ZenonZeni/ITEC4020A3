SLANTS & TRENDS
***************


EMERGING MARKETS: Although political and economic
instability continues to plague many Central and Eastern
European countries, interest in the environmental goods and
services markets there continues. Initially off to a
somewhat rocky start, many states, especially such Eastern
European countries as the Czech and Slovak Republics,
Hungary and Poland, are adopting Western-style environmental
regulations. Further, privatization of state-held industries
has put environmental concerns in the hands of individuals
rather than often unaccountable bureaucracies. Still,
creating a sustainable development ethic is difficult amid
hard economic times, analysts say. And without adequate
state funding or enforcement of existing environmental laws
and regulations, the pace of remediation and pollution
abatement programs has been slow.

     This issue of WER looks at several facets of
environmental protection in Central and Eastern Europe,
particularly the problems faced by Russia and its nuclear
power industry. Because of the inherent safety problems
posed by radioactive materials, this sector requires
specialized environmental engineers and relatively high
costs, often beyond the reach of the former Second World's
developing economies.

* * *

CHINA TARGETED: While the West focuses much attention on
Central and Eastern Europe, funds also are flowing to
Communist China, where rapid industrialization and
population growth continues to plague the environment. The
European Investment Bank just issued its first loan to China
for environmentally friendly development of clean-burning
natural gas reserves. The project will help the environment
through the distribution of natural gas in Pudong, a
satellite city of Shanghai, which will reduce the air
pollution caused  by the present use of coal and town gas.
The EIB is providing roughly $73 million for the development
of the Ping Hu offshore field. The $1 billion project is
being co-financed by the Asian Development Bank, the Exim
Bank of Japan and France.


Central/Eastern European News Briefs

     Events creating possibilities for sales of
environmental goods and services in Central and Eastern Eu-
rope are routine occurrences. The following is a snapshot of
environmental news stories that occurred just before or
after the New Year.

Russia Having Trouble With CFCs

     Russia is asking for more time to cut ozone-threatening
substances. At a major international conference of
government representatives convened in Vienna to review the
1987 Montreal Protocol on ozone protection, Russian
Federation Environment Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said
Russia needs more time and a larger pool of investment aid
in order to develop substitutes to ozone-harming substances
such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Under the Montreal
Protocol, signed by 150 countries, such industrialized
countries as Russia are to stop producing CFCs by 1996 and
the rest of the signatories by 2010.

     Minister Danilov-Danilyan said the Russian Federation
is now producing only half the ozone-threatening chemicals
it was in 1987, but he added that the drop was a by-product
of the fall in industrial output. The minister was quick to
point out that he and his government would have preferred to
be able to meet the deadline, as other governments are
doing, but that the economic conditions prevailing within
his country are making it impossible for the principal
factories from even paying their workers, let alone their
taxes and electric bills. It will be impossible for the
Russian government to force such enterprises, even if they
are state-owned (and many are not) to comply with the
protocol when the ministry has no financial capacity to
support the enterprise's change-over to non-CFC production
or usage.

German, Swiss, Finnish Waste

     Germany and Switzerland have decided not to send spent
nuclear fuel to Krasnoyarsk-26 for processing, Krasnoyarsk
Krai Deputy Governor Sergei Arinchin was quoted as saying.
The waste would have been processed at the RT-2 plant -
still under construction - in the formerly secret nuclear
center in Siberia. The Russian authorities had hoped to
finance the project by accepting foreign waste, enabling
them to process their own stocks. The Swiss and German
pullout will deal a major blow to the project. The decision
is likely to be hailed by environmental groups, which have
strongly opposed the importation of nuclear materials,
arguing that Russia's waste storage sites are already
overflowing.

     Meanwhile, a trainload of spent nuclear fuel from a
Finnish nuclear power plant reportedly has arrived in Russia
for processing at the Mayak plant in Chelyabinsk-65. An
English translation of the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper
says it is not yet clear whether the nuclear residue remain-
ing after processing will be shipped back to Finland or kept
inside the Russian Federation.

Nuclear Safety Threatened

     Nuclear safety may be threatened by workers at Russia's
nuclear power plants, who say they may shut down the
facilities unless they receive overdue wage payments.
Officials say they have scheduled warning protests, but it
is not clear what form they will take. Energy consumers owe
nuclear power plants about 2.5 trillion rubles (US$555
million), and on average workers have not been paid for
three months, according to the deputy head of Rosenergoatom
in Moscow.

Assistance from Germany

     A German company has signed a contract with Russia's
Kursk nuclear power plant to construct a nuclear waste
storage facility and to provide 240 containers to store the
plant's radioactive waste. The German Company for Nuclear
Containers, a Nukem subsidiary, will control production
quality, train specialists and provide the know-how for
production. According to Gosatomnadzor, Russia's nuclear
safety agency, the solid waste storage facilities at the
Kursk plant are full.

Kazakhstan Troubled

     The amount of radioactive waste accumulating at uranium
mining and processing plants in Kazakhstan reportedly is
reaching alarming proportions. Since this large, very poor
Central Asian country became independent in 1991, the
quantity of radioactive waste stored in Kazakhstan has grown
to 219 million metric tons. The republic's Ministry of
Ecology and Biological Resources claims the aggregate
radioactivity from the waste comes to 250,000 curies, which
is "many times more than the accepted norm." Kazakhstan does
not have the means to deal with the waste because under the
Soviet Union's regime disposal was a national responsibility
carried out by the government in Moscow. Today, there are
neither any Kazakh laws nor bilateral agreements with Russia
which adequately address this type of nuclear waste disposal
dilemma.

ARTHUR D. LITTLE IS AWARDED $7.6 MILLION
TO HELP BELARUS TACKLE DEFENSE WASTE


     The international consulting firm Arthur D. Little has
been awarded a $7.6 million contract to help the former
Soviet republic of Belarus solve environmental problems
related to its former Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) bases.

     The two-and-a-half-year contract from the Defense
Nuclear Agency (DNA) is part of the Cooperative Threat
Reduction (CTR) Program developed under the l991 Nunn-Lugar
legislation intended to assist the countries of the former
Soviet Union in the elimination, and to prevent the
proliferation, of weapons of mass destruction.

     Arthur D. Little experts will help Belarus personnel to
assess the radiation and conventional environmental damage
at sites where intercontinental ballistic missiles were
based, transported, operated, or maintained, and help the
country restore them for other purposes. In Belarus alone,
at the height of the arms race, there were more than 80 SS-
25 missiles. Belarus has since declared itself a non-nuclear
state and wishes to return the facilities to civilian use.

     Arthur D. Little consultants will integrate a number of
different technical resources within the program to provide
training and technical assistance to the Belarus officials
and experts. The consultants will work with the Belarus
personnel to analyze the environmental problems at one
missile site and devise a restoration plan, then oversee the
Belarus technicians as they do environmental restoration
work at a second site. The ultimate goal is to transfer
enough knowledge to Belarus so that they can complete the
environmental restoration work at the remaining sites.

     Potential environmental problems include heavy metal
and low-level radioactive contaminants, spilled petroleum,
spilled liquid rocket fuel, and some minefields around the
sites' perimeters which have unexploded ordnances.

     As part of the effort to transfer expertise in the
environmental restoration field, Arthur D. Little will
conduct international conferences co-sponsored by DNA and
the Belarus Ministry of Defense. Experts from around the
world will be invited to Belarus to discuss a variety of
environmental restoration experiences, technologies, and
management issues.

     As part of the CTR program, an agreement was signed in
l993 between the United States and the Republic of Belarus
to assist in development of the Environmental Restoration
Project. Other CTR projects in Belarus under Nunn-Lugar
include assistance in defense conversion, export control
systems and training, government-to-government
communications links, and emergency response equipment and
training.

     Belarus, located between Poland and Russia, has an
especially high water table and active groundwater movement,
which can exacerbate groundwater pollution.

     Other organizations involved with Arthur D. Little on
the Environmental Restoration Project include the Army Corps
of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Los Alamos
Technical Associates, Technology Management Company, the
Environmental Chemical Corp., the Environmental Hazards
Specialists International, Environmental Careers
Organizations, the World Environment Center, and Clean
Sites, Inc.

     Arthur D. Little, which conducted the largest
environmental impact assessment ever conducted in the Former
Soviet Union by a Western company, has handled more than
3,000 environmental audits and assessments in 30 countries
throughout Europe and the United States. Headquartered in
Cambridge, MA., Arthur D. Little has offices around the
world. It provides consulting in three areas: environmental,
health, and safety consulting; management consulting; and
technology and product development.

     RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SAFETY: Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's
minister of nuclear energy, announced Jan. 2 that nuclear
smuggling should be the top item on the agenda for the April
G-7 summit in Moscow. Mikhailov said the summit, devoted to
nuclear safety issues, should draft "common procedures" for
dealing with nuclear smuggling and tightening control over
nuclear materials. He also announced his ministry made $1.65
billion from exports in 1995, a significant contribution to
Russia's $63 billion in total exports, and not much less
than the $2.5 billion Russia earned by exporting arms.
However, many of the countries that want to purchase Russian
civilian nuclear technology, such as Iran and Cuba, have a
questionable ability to pay for it, casting doubt on
Mikhailov's prediction that nuclear exports can be boosted
to $2 billion by 1998.

RUSSIAN ENVIRONMENT MARKET
TO BE SUBJECT OF NEW STUDY


     Arthur D. Little has undertaken a study of the Russian
market for environmental equipment and services to help U.S.
companies determine export potential as that area of the
world rebuilds its economy.

     The study, requested by the U.S. Department of Commerce
and the American Embassy in Moscow, will determine the
potential for U.S. environmental goods and services in
Russia, indicate current and future trends, and highlight
the dominant driving forces and pressing environmental
concerns in the Russian market.

     The information will be used to help U.S. companies
decide whether and how to compete in the Russian
environmental services market, and help lay the groundwork
for U.S. government-sponsored trade promotion events.

Many Subjects Targeted

     Special areas Arthur D. Little consultants will explore
include the most pressing environmental needs in air, water,
and solid waste pollution control and prevention, and the
barriers that could restrict access to the Russian market by
U.S. environmental services firms.

     U.S. firms have indicated a growing interest in the
potential for environmental goods and services sales in
Russia as more public and private money is invested in
rebuilding the economy.

Services being assessed include:

     l Solid and hazardous waste management;
     l Waste site cleanup or construction;
     l Pollution abatement in such areas as asbestos, lead,
and radon; and
     l Environmental consulting and engineering in hazardous
waste, air and water quality, pollution prevention, and
environmental management.
     Equipment markets include:
     l Air, water, and solid waste pollution controls;
     l Environmental monitoring systems;
     l Waste containment, disposal and treatment tech-
nologies;
     l Thermal technologies;
     l Bulk liquid removal; and
     l Groundwater collection.

     Anthony Montrone, vice president in charge of Arthur D.
Little's environmental business strategy practice, and David
Webb, director of the firm's Moscow office, said Arthur D.
Little was chosen because of its long history of helping
companies enter international environmental products and
services markets, and its experience addressing
environmental issues in Russia.

UKRAINE RESEARCH FACILITY BOASTS
ADVANCED REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGY


     Ukraine has recently produced two technologies that may
significantly facilitate remediation of industrial waste
waters as well as the recycling of used oil and such
composite wastes as grinding swarf and certain sludges.

     Marketing of the technologies is being handled through
the Struten Institute, which promotes access to these and
other technology-transfer opportunities.

     One Ukrainian research institute has developed methods
to produce a semipermeable membrane made of synthetic
diamond, the Struten Institute says. The material may be
placed on a variety of substrates, including ceramics.

     The result is a semipermeable membrane that is
simultaneously resistant to heat, abrasion and pressure.

     In a separate yet linked development, another Ukrainian
institute has perfected a method for "scrubbing" the surface
of semipermeable membranes. From a physical chemistry stand-
point, it is now possible to continually and economically
stir-up otherwise sedate layers.

     The method has so far been applied to polymeric
membranes, speeding reverse osmosis pressures as low as 2-5
atmospheres, the Student Institute says.

     The Struten Institute is a nonprofit organization based
in the United States and geared toward bringing technically
trained individuals from Ukraine in contact with Western
companies.

     "This business level, technical contact, mediated
through the Struten Institute, is a dividend some businesses
will realize from the fall of communism," the institute said
in a statement.

     Differentiating between Ukraine and the Russian
Federation, the Struten Institute says it is keen to help
companies economically secure research and development
partners and tap Ukraine's emerging market of 52 million
people.

EUROPEAN UNION MOVES TO TIGHTEN
ENVIRONMENTAL RULES ON PROJECTS


     European Union environment ministers have reached a
political agreement to extend the range of development
projects requiring environmental impact assessments (EIAs)
before final approval is granted. Meeting in Brussels in
late December, the ministers endorsed proposal COM(93)575,
which expands the EIA requirements under directive
85/337/EEC.

     The move, termed a decade too late, was hailed by many
in the environment industry for opening the door to new
goods and services sales. The revised rules will come into
effect in January 1998, but only after parliamentary
approval.

     Spanish Transport and Public Works Minister Jose
Borrell, who chaired the meeting as EU environment
president, said the union now has a complete series of rules
on which investment projects require EIAs. In recent years,
EIAs largely have been conducted on an ad hoc basis, have at
times been poor in quality, and recommendations from
stakeholders sometimes have not been followed, EU sources
say.

     Under the new regime, the EIAs will more accurately
identify potential environmental problems associated with
proposed development projects and give stakeholders,
including developers, authorities and the public, ample
opportunity to discuss them, the ministers said in a
concluding statement. Projects plagued by poor EIA
implementation include Britain's Twyford Down transportation
project and Greece's plan to divert the Acheloos River.

     The new rules extend mandatory EIAs to such sectors as
road-widening, nonhazardous waste storage facilities, water
wells and management, oil and gas drilling, petroleum
pipelines, dams, intensive hog and poultry farming, pulp and
paper factories, open mines and  quarries, overhead power
lines, and chemical storage facilities exceeding 200,000
metric tons. EIAs may also be required, but will not be
mandatory, for forestry, mineral extraction, energy, metal
and chemical processing, food, textiles and  tourism
projects.

JAMAICA SEEKS UN FUNDING
FOR SEABED PROTECTION


     Kingston asked the United Nations Dec. 26 to restore
funds for the International Seabed Authority, a group that
would oversee economic activities in international waters.
One of the authority's main responsibilities will be to
supervise seabed mining. The move follows a U.N. decision to
cut 1996 funding from $2.6 million to $770,000. The ruling
also would eliminate several of the 17 proposed posts.

     Although the authority boasts 170 member countries,
participants have not been able to decide on who should sit
on the council or who should serve as the secretary general.
The authority will meet next in Kingston in March. Jamaica,

Utama (SAU) with aquaculture products and technical services
to support the company's shrimp hatchery and farm operations
in South Sulawesi.

     The contract calls on Epicore to help address the many
environmental problems that have plagued the Indonesian
facility. Environmental and other problems are said to
seriously threaten the $7 billion international aquaculture
industry. "This contract, with a major Indonesian aqua-
culture company, confirms the effectiveness of Epicore's
"solutions" based strategy," said Chief Executive Officer
Ian Fraser.

     Epicore uses natural microbes and enzymes that are

COMPANIES, REGULATORS AGREE
ON STRATEGY FOR NEW TESTS


     Multinational companies concerned about the cost of
assessing the environmental and health hazards posed by
their operations may benefit from a new set of toxicology
test strategies drafted last month. The new methods are
designed to save time and money, better predict health
effects of drugs, chemicals, radiation and other substances
and reduce, refine or replace animal use.

     The Interagency Coordination Committee on the
Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) has issued a
report viewed as important to the international environment
community because it should enhance global efforts to
harmonize toxicity testing methods. Countries are trying to
harmonize methods so health regulators around the world can
share data and make comparable risk assessments.
Corporations support the effort which would make it easier
to conduct tests accepted throughout the global economy.

     More than 150 people discussed a draft report by the
ICCVAM at a National Toxicology Program workshop held in
mid-December. ICCVAM represents 15 U.S. federal agencies
including National Institutes of Health, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Centers for
Disease Control, the Department of Energy, the Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Department of
Transportation.

     ICCVAM designed its report to apply to all proposed
toxicological testing methods for health and ecological
effects. New tests could supplement or be alternatives to
the traditional two-year rodent bioassay used in risk
assessments and regulatory decisionmaking. New tests could
involve transgenic animals, mathematical and computer
models, and in vitro methods, such as test tube or petri
dish experiments with tissue samples. The new methodologies
should help agencies better protect human health and safety,
said ICCVAM co-chair William Stokes.

     The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel-
opment (OECD), which represents 25 nations, approves
guidelines for new test methods. OECD-member nations must
accept data generated by tests that followed approved guide-
lines, said OECD representative Herman Koeter. OECD experts
will review ICCVAM's report Jan. 22-24 at a workshop on
alternative test methods.

     ICCVAM's report describes eight criteria agencies would
use to assess a proposed test method's validity. For
example, researchers or manufacturers should test the new
procedure on agents similar to the substances to which the
method would be applied. The researchers also should give
agencies a detailed protocol describing the method,
materials needed, criteria by which data will be evaluated
and the procedure's limitations. The protocol should be
reviewed by an independent scientific panel.

     Agencies should consider more than a dozen criteria in
determining whether they should accept a new test method,
ICCVAM said. For example, the new procedure should: be
approved by the scientific community; adequately predict the
endpoint of interest; be readily transferred among
laboratories; and generate data that is as good or better
for hazard identification and/or dose-response assessment
than the test for which it is proposed to be a substitute.

     "The report is excellent," said David Brusick, echoing
comments expressed by many participants. Brusick, Corning
Hazleton's scientific director, co-chaired one of three
panels making recommendations for the report. He suggested
ICCVAM define a formal validation process and highlight it
and other key recommendations in tables and flow charts.

     Companies, agency scientists and other stakeholders
should be involved early on and throughout the process of
validating and accepting new methods, said Patricia
Williams, vice president of Glycomed, a biopharmaceutical
company. Risk assessors also must be involved to help ensure
data will meet their needs.

     Lawmakers and/or private industry should fund ICCVAM or
a similar committee to educate regulators about new test
methods, coordinate agencies' actions, and work with the
international community, several speakers said. Since
industry will benefit if these tests are accepted, companies
should consider funding, through a user fee, efforts to
approve the tests, said Steve Niemi, vice president of the
Genzyme Transgenics Corp.

Harmonizing testing methods may save firms millions of
dollars annually, Senior Scientist David Neuman, of the Ilsi
Risk Science Institute later said. Currently, to satisfy
divergent requirements, companies may conduct several
expensive tests that vary in only minor details. Duplicating
tests does little to help researchers or regulators
understand the substance being studied, he said. ICCVAM
expects to issue a final report this summer. Contact: Alma
Britton, +1-919-541-0530.

UNEP VOICES SUPPORT FOR METHODS
THAT ENSURE GREATER DIVERSITY


     Local, regional and global initiatives to preserve
biodiversity were lauded Dec. 29 by world leaders
celebrating the International Day for Biological Diversity.

     In addition to touting the virtues of biodiversity,
leaders said companies looking to market their pollution
abatement and remediation goods and services will benefit
from helping improve public awareness of environmental
problems.

     Summarizing the day's theme was a statement by the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), which said
biological diversity constitutes the resource upon which
families, communities, nations and future generations
depend.

     (The Convention on Biological Diversity went into
effect Dec. 29, 1993. The document was signed by 167
countries plus the European Union on June 5 1992 and has to
date been ratified by 136 states.)

     Describing all living creatures as having its place and
function, the UNEP believes that through thoughtless action,
mankind is eroding the Earth's biological capital at an
alarming rate.

     "The world is being impoverished by the loss of its
richest resources - of forests, wetlands and seas and
depletion of its most fundamental stock - its species, its
ecosystems and its habitats," said UNEP Executive Director
Elizabeth Dowdeswell. Further, the loss of every gene,
species or ecosystem means a loss of an available adaptive
option.

     Although many countries and industry sectors take for
granted the Earth's natural bounty and resilience, the
ability of natural systems to bounce back after disruption
is declining. "If the environment is reaching the limits of
its endurance, what can each one of us do to conserve our
planet's biological capital?" the statement asks.

     An active and well-informed public is the best defence
for the environment, UNEP says. "An education that empowers
and enables people to seek collectively ways to overcome
current destructive trends is a critical component of any
successful strategy for achieving a sustainable future.

     Toward this ends, UNEP is eager to enlist the support
of indigenous conservation groups, whose indigenous
knowledge and wisdom about the environment may well provide
the resilience to adapt to the future environmental changes.
And, experience has shown that wherever local people have
been given greater responsibility for managing their own
resources, they have shown both a capacity and a willingness
to conserve.

     Sectors that should become more actively involved in
preserving biodiversity include the pharmaceutical industry,
agriculture, tourism, fisheries and industries requiring raw
materials.

     The United Nations Environment Program today works to
support the Convention on Biological Diversity by
strengthening the national and global base of knowledge on
biodiversity.

Industry Reaches Out

     The Paris-based Association Valentin Hauy has
translated the Convention on Biological Diversity into
braille and an initial print run of 1,000 English and 1,000
French copies were released Dec. 29. The version will be
distributed free of charge to organizations for blind and
partially sighted people around the world.

     The Spanish National Organization of the Blind (ONCE)
based in Madrid released 200 copies of the Spanish braille
version plus 200 copies on cassette. The event represents
the first time industry has joined forces with the

News Briefs

     l AIR POLLUTION - EUROPEAN UNION: The European
Commission plans to introduce two environmental initiatives
and to focus on member states' implementation of existing
environmental laws in 1996. The new initiatives will take on
industrial emissions of VOCs and the waste problems posed by
scrapped vehicles. Proposals to increase compliance with ex-
isting rules will include revisions to Directive 70/220 to
cut air pollution from "not privately owned" motor vehicles
and amendments to Directive 88/77 on pollution from diesel
emissions. Also pending are two initiatives for eco-labeling
of packaging and packaging waste.

     l CLIMATE - FINLAND: Pekka Kauppi of the Finnish Forest
Research Institute has concluded that the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change's goal of stabilizing
greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels is an "unattainable"
goal. His warning follows a conclusion by international
scientists that humans are at least partially responsible
for climate change.

     l ENERGY - AUSTRALIA: Australian Energy Minister Tony
McGrady has announced 49 megawatts of electricity from
burning the sugar industry by-product bagasse will join the
Queensland power grid by Jan. 1, 1998. Mills in Invicta,
Kalamia, Inkerman, South Johnstone and Maryborough are
participating. The environmentally friendly technology may
be transferred to the thousands of sugar mills throughout
the world.

corporate competitiveness through environmental management.
The seminar, A Mine From Hell: A Business Approach to
Environmental Management Issues, will be held Jan. 30 at the
Ottawa Public Library. The gathering will discuss the Crown
Butte Mines Inc.'s New World Mine in Montana. The Canadian
company Noranda Inc. owns controlling interest in the New
World Mine. Neither condemning or endorsing the mine, the
seminar will present a set of circumstances that will allow
participants to appraise and discuss a business management

     l MARKETING - INTERNET: Companies looking for marketing
opportunities in the Eastern and Central Europe may be
interested in a new World Wide Web site established by the
Sacred Earth Network, a networking service among Western and
Eurasian Environmental nongovernmental organizations. The
site is located at http://www.igc.apc.org/sen/.
"Nongovernmental environmental organizations in the former
Soviet Union play an important role at home and abroad," the
organization said in announcing the site. "Their dedicated
professional and volunteer members strive to provide
reliable information about current conditions and the
effectiveness of remedial or conservation techniques. As
international collaboration grows, electronic mail has
become vital to the efficient development and implementation
of environmental programs." The site includes a directory of
e-mail users.

     l MEDICAL WASTE - AUSTRALIA: Too much waste is
considered infectious, drinking up hospital waste disposal
costs, according to the Australian Medical Association
(AMA). The contention was voiced during the Medwaste '95
conference sponsored by Griffith University. The AMA said
surveys show that 60 percent of what is put in hospital
infectious waste containers, including packaging and
flowers, is not infectious. With disposal of infectious
waste costing three times as much as general waste, the AMA
is concerned there is an over-zealous attitude toward
infectious waste. The AMA wants doctors to take the lead in
differentiating truly infectious from ordinary trash. In
Australia, hospitals only generated 0.5 kg of waste per
patient per day 15 years ago and now generate 15 kg. All
hospitals together produce  an  estimated  600,000 kg of
solid

waste daily. The buildup is partially due to the
introduction of single-use items, including medication cups
and oxygen masks.

     l POPULATION - WORLD: Because population growth and its
demand on natural resources is one of the leading causes of
environmental degradation, countries and international
institutions are looking for ways to integrate family
planning into long-range sustainable development goals. The
Population Institute revealed Dec. 28 that 4.7 billion of
the world's 5.7 billion residents, or 80 percent, live
outside the industrialized world. The population in
nonindustrialized countries will double in between 32 and 36
years, compared with 430 years for developed countries,
according to the institute's most recent report. In
aggregate, the world's population will double in 40 years.
This means that the vast majority of the 100 million new
mouths that will enter the world in 1996 will be found in
countries least able to meet the demand. As a result, the
fragile environment in these countries will suffer greatly,
the institute says. Particular problems include excess use
of firewood and overfarming of eroding lands.

     l PRODUCTS - INTERNET: Magnet Inc. of Seattle, Wash.,
has established a World Wide Web site, Better World, to
promote environmentally friendly products and information
for individuals and industry. The site, located at
http://www.betterworld.com, includes a wide range of
environmental information, including recycling and waste
minimization. Companies also can post online storefronts for
direct sales, product information, public relations
materials, and any other information they wish to convey to
potential customers. Contact: MagNet Inc. on the World Wide
Web at http://www.magnets.com or Barry Harrington
Associates, +1-510-376-4109; e-mail: barry.harrington@magnets.com.

     l RADIOACTIVE WASTE - ITALY: Italy will receive at
least 7,000 cubic meters of its own radioactive waste,
according to the National Agency for the Environment (ANPA).
The country had sent it for containment in England in the
late 1960's. Italy is way behind schedule in constructing
storage containers for the waste, said ANPA spokesperson
Renata Montesanti. Further, waste in England is the tip of
the iceberg, says the report, which recommends a creation of
a central government body and national standards to
coordinate radioactive waste management.

     l SOLAR ENERGY - ISRAEL: A plan to build a large solar
power facility in Israel is expected to draw a proposal from
Amoco-Enron Solar Power Development Co., in cooperation with
Israeli partners. A report from Israel said Amoco-Enron is
working with the Israeli companies Solel and Ormat Engines
on a proposal for a 100-megawatt solar facility for the
Israel Electric Corp. (IEC), but an official of the Houston-
based company declined to identify the firms involved. Rick
Barsky, senior vice president for development at Amoco-Enron
Solar Power Development, said he expects a request for
proposals for an 80-MW facility to be issued in the first
half of 1996. "We intend to look at that RFP and potentially
to respond to it," he said.

     l WASTE - GERMANY: There are at least 240,000 waste
sites suspected of polluting the German environment,
according to the International Trade Fair for Waste and
Waste Water Disposal. The Federal Environment Ministry said
earlier federal and state governments could provide DM24
billion to DM30 billion for clean-up in eastern lands by
2002. The German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin
said western Germany needs between 60 billion and DM100
billion for cleanups through 2005.

     l WATER POLLUTION - GERMANY: A treaty between the
German Chemical Manufacturers Association (VCI) and
Rotterdam in The Netherlands aims at reducing industrial
pollution of the Rhine River. The agreement affects about 50
VCI companies with sites along the Rhine. By 2000, they
promise to cut 1986 levels of zinc by 78 percent, mercury 77
percent, chromium 87 percent, copper 69 percent, nickel 64
percent, cadmium 58 percent, lead 57 percent and arsenic 2
percent. In return, Rotterdam, situated where the Rhine
enters the North Sea, will renounce until 2000 any damage
claims against VCI member companies for arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, mercury and nickel. The Port of Rotterdam is
sensitive to pollution of silt, which it must dredge con-
tinually.
