<P><CENTER><B>BUDGET ANNOUNCEMENT ON SPACE PROGRAM<BR>
</B><HR></CENTER>
<P>The 1996/97 Commonwealth Budget incorporated an exciting development
for Australian space science. <BR>
<BR>
The Minister for Science, the Hon Peter McGauran MP, has called upon CSIRO
to become the Australian space agency. CSIRO's new role, to be managed by
COSSA, will include responsibility for arranging international and national
cooperation in space projects. <BR>
<BR>
The most exciting news, however, is the announcement of a new program to
develop, launch and operate scientific microsatellites, the first by 2001.
<BR>
<BR>
This effort will be managed by COSSA, with support from the Australian Space
Research Institute Ltd and other groups. COSSA, with ASRI, will prepare
over the next few months a proposal for a Co-operative Research Centre in
Microsatellite Applications. This is expected to provide $10 m in new funding,
over 5 years.<BR>
<BR>
CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Malcolm McIntosh has expressed strong support for
this new charter for CSIRO, and COSSA. <BR>
<BR>
I have guaranteed COSSA's full commitment to this task, which will not decrease
our commitment to the Earth Observation Centre. <BR>
<BR>
