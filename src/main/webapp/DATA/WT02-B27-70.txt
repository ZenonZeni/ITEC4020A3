<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Overview of Cognitive Apprenticeship<BR>
Models of Teaching</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#SG">Sue Gerber<BR>

<HR></A></FONT>Learning occurs in many settings and as the result of many
types of interactions. It has been noted that learning within and outside
of school is quite different (<A HREF="cogref#Shuell">Shuell, 1996</A>).
Outside of the school context, apprenticeship is one of the most prevalent
methods of learning. In fact, learning from watching and to some extent
copying others may be one of the most natural and, at least initially,
most efficient, ways in which people learn.<BR>
<BR>
Under this assumption, the main criticism of traditional teaching in schools
is that it is often a decontextualized presentation of facts and concepts,
without any ties to real world problems and/or situations. There is a concern,
therefore that students are not learning the type of knowledge and skills
that are valued by our society. Theoretically, cognitive apprenticeships
circumvent this shortcoming in part by focusing on real world applications.<BR>
<BR>
Traditional apprenticeships have three dimensions or aspects: (a) observing,
(b) coaching, and (c) practice. Collins, Brown, and Newman list analogous
dimensions applying to cognitive apprenticeships: </P>

<P>During the modeling phase, the teacher takes on much of the cognitive
load and demonstrates the process that the students are to learn. It is
important to note that although the students are not overtly active during
this phase (i.e., they are not using concrete manipulatives or engaging
in dialogue) they are constructing a conceptual model of the &quot;big
picture,&quot; or ultimate goal, of the process. This provides the students
with something tangible to which they may refer when learning and practicing
the sub-processes of task. They are, for instance, able to understand the
purpose behind each piece of the larger whole.<BR>
<BR>
The coaching phase refers to the stage of learning during which the teacher
organizes learning opportunities to facilitate the learners' mastery of
the educational objectives. The teacher also provides hints and reminders
of the techniques (s)he previously modeled.<BR>
<BR>
The teacher continues to help or provide scaffolding in this way, as the
student gradually builds his/her knowledge base and skills in the given
area. When appropriate, the teacher reduces his or her overt presence and
support, fading away, and leaving the learner to think and do on his/her
own.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, not only does the cognitive apprenticeship model incorporate our
current knowledge about the ways in which people learn, but it also attends
to one of the fundamental issues in reform movements today -- a focus on
real world and practical applications. <BR>
<BR>
This must not, however, be done to the exclusion of attention to the more
abstract, generalizeable, type of knowledge traditionally valued in school
learning. In other words, there must be a balance between training (or
preparation for life), and what is considered &quot; traditional, classic
education&quot; (<A HREF="cogref#Shuell">Shuell, 1996</A>). Teachers must
be aware of this potential trap, and design their instructional episodes
so as to include attention to the abstraction of general principles. Collins
and his associates seem to address this issue by including three additional
teaching methods in their discussion: (a) articulating, (b) reflecting,
and (c) exploring.<BR>
