During 1994, there were developments that will ensure the department's continuing strength during a time of change. The NIMH-supported Child Psychiatry Clinical Research Center and the Research Training Grant were successfully renewed for a further five years. Initiatives were started to obtain funding for an endowed chair in Child Psychopharmacology. Several talented research trainees obtained new Career Development Awards and other support that will extend the department's funded research activities in measurement, developmental psychopathology, and biological psychology. The Child Training and Clinical Program adapted to the changing clinical climate by providing clinics and training in shorter and more focused forms of psychotherapy. The Clinical Department further developed its programs for the increasing number of children whose families are affected by HIV infection.

<B>New Research Activities</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The NIMH-supported Clinical Research Center and Research Training Program in Child Psychiatry were each renewed for a further five years.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
NIMH support was received by David Shaffer, Prudence Fisher, and Christopher Lucas to develop the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children for epidemiological use and as a diagnostic aid in a clinic setting. Jennifer Havens and Claude Mellins received a grant from the SAMHSA to develop a demonstration service for the mental health needs of families affected by HIV.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
NIMH Scientist Development Awards were received by Christopher Lucas, M.D., for a research program on measurement in child psychopathology and by Cheryl Slomkowski, Ph.D., to study sibling influences on antisocial behavior.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Contracts were received from NIMH and NICHD by Christina Hoven and Hector Bird (Choices for Children in Need of Mental Health Services) and Gail Wasserman (Norming and Validating the Early-Adolescent HOME Scale).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Awards from private foundations included an Aaron Diamond Foundation Award to Claude Mellins to study the impact of HIV on families; from the Klingenstein Third Generation Family Foundation to David Shaffer to implement suicide screening projects in local high schools; from the Carmel Hill Fund to David Shaffer and Christopher Lucas to study suicide screening at Boystown of America; and from the American Suicide Foundation to Susan Wolk to study serotonin measures in adults with childhood-onset major depression. Lawrence Greenhill, M.D. was supported by Richwood Pharmaceuticals to investigate the effects of Adderall and methylphenidate in children with ADHD.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Child Psychiatry has several sources for funding internal grants. During the past year the following awards were made: from the Viola Bernard Endowment Fund to Richard Gaines, Ph.D.; from the American Suicide Foundation to Susan Wolk, M.D., John Piacentini, Ph.D., Daniel Pine, M.D., and David Castro-Blanco, Ph.D.; from the CRC Pilot Fund to Janet Fairbanks, M.D., Richard Gaines, Ph.D., Madelyn Gould, Ph.D., Arthur Green, M.D., Noreen Hernandez, Ph.D., Ronan VanRossem, Ph.D., Laura Whitman, M.D., Susan Wolk, M.D., and Jonathan Slater, M.D.; from the PIRSG Fund to Jorge Armenteros, M.D., Judith Feldman, Ph.D., and Arturo Sanchez-Lacay, M.D.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department was supported by the Roddy D. Brickell Foundation to provide a broad program of support for research and services relating to child and adolescent suicide and by the American Suicide Foundation to fund small suicide-related research projects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department was responsible for sponsoring a joint Italian-American Research Conference at the Italian Academy of Columbia University for Child Psychiatrists from the mainland of Italy.

<B>Research Findings</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Gail Wasserman, Ph.D. and Daniel Pine, M.D., in the Lowenstein Center for the Study of Disruptive Disorders, have noted significant relationships between aggressive behavior and cardiovascular function and Body Mass Index. Center scientists have also identified significant short-term predictors of persistence and desistance of aggressive behavior in young children.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Laurie Miller and Rachel Klein, in the Jonas Center for the Prevention of Disruptive Disorders, are undertaking an intensive prevention study with an emphasis on parent training. Preliminary data from a small number of subjects show positive effects that could have implications in larger studies for prevention of antisocial behavior.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Shaffer has developed a screen that can be used in large samples of adolescents to identify teens at risk for suicide. This research has been well received and has led to grants from the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation to implement the strategies and techniques in a public school setting at low cost.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Bird and Hoven have developed measures of impairment that have been tested in several large samples. These techniques differentiate purely symptomatic but well-functioning individuals from those who would be more properly classed as patients. This work is important in the field of epidemiology for the task of defining "caseness." Dr. Madelyn Gould, Ph.D., undertaking a large study of suicide clusters, has suggestive evidence that children who die in a cluster are less disturbed and commit suicide more impulsively than those who die in non-epidemic circumstances. This finding points to the importance of social psychological factors in facilitating suicide in young people.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, developed by David Shaffer, M.D. and his colleagues Prudence Fisher, M.S. and Christopher Lucas, M.D., is being revised under NIMH contract to achieve compatibility with DSM-IV and ICD-10. The interview has achieved broad currency and is now being translated into several languages and is being used in a large number of research projects. In a study in Boystown of America Institutions, it has been found to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of initial screening and triage leading to diagnosis based quality control at low cost.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Pediatric Psychiatry Division at Presbyterian Hospital, under the direction of Drs. Richard Gaines, Ph.D. and Jennifer Havens, M.D., is the major provider of psychiatric services to children and adolescents in northern Manhattan. In 1994, the outpatient service at Babies and Children's Hospital, the Neurological Institute, the Family Center (child abuse intervention program), and the On-Site School Program recorded 26,421 visits, a 5% increase over 1993. Major increments occurred in the Family Center (12% increase), which provides psychiatric services to HIV-infected and/or drug-exposed children. The Special Needs Clinic, founded in 1991, has continued to draw the attention of both private foundations and government agencies. Within the last year, major awards included Ryan White I funds, a contract from SAMSHA, New York State Office of Mental Health Family Support Funds, and the Child Welfare Fund.

<B>Training Programs</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Child and Adolescent Residency Training Program under the direction of Drs. Clarice J. Kestenbaum and lan A. Canino provides training for graduate psychiatrists wishing to pursue a career in administrative, clinical, academic, research, or hospital-based child psychiatry. The program provides training in the most important and useful methods of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment, ensures familiarity with a range of clinical problems, provides trainees with an introduction to research methods and strategies and imparts a sense of competence in clinical teaching and administration. A three-year course in General Residency Training in Child Psychiatry is under the Directorship of Dr. Owen Lewis. Medical School Education in Child Psychiatry is under the Directorship of Dr. Donna Moreau. Dr. Steven Rosenheck directs training in Family Therapy and Dr. Ken Gorfinkel directs training in Cognitive Behavior Therapy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The residency is divided into discrete rotations in different clinical settings including one of the three state facilities with which we are affiliated: Manhattan Children's Psychiatric Center, Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center, and Queens Children's Psychiatric Center. The program of Manhattan Children's Psychiatric Center will be closing in 1995.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are six to eight openings for child fellowship training each year. Two are designated for a five-year track that integrates child, adolescent, and general psychiatry training. A special track has been established to study culturally sensitive approaches for inner city minority children. An NIMH grant (Principal Investigator: Ian Canino, M.D.) helps support two minority residents.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1988, the CARING at Columbia fund was established to integrate some unusual programs in our residency training. These included a program to expose residents to group dynamics and social skill development of inner city children within a creative arts program (Museo del Barrio) and workshops provided by the Poets in Public Service.
