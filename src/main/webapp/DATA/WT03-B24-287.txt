<P><CENTER><B><font color=green>PLANS SET FOR NATIONAL POETRY MONTH</font></B></CENTER>

<P><IMG SRC="image/poster.gif" align=left hspace=10 width=191 height=261 ALT="national poetry month">

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> The <B>Academy of American Poets</B> has announced plans for the second annual National Poetry Month, to take place in April of this year. Among the scheduled events is a Tax Day celebration of T.S. Eliot's <B> <I>The Waste Land</I></B> ("April is the cruelest month . . . ."). The Acedemy will join with publisher <B>Harcourt Brace</B> to commemorate the poem's 75th anniversary by distributing thousands of free copies of a special edition of the poem at post offices all over the country. 

<P>The Academy will also work with the <B>American Booksellers Association</B>, the <B>American Library Association</B>, and other institutions to mount an ambitious program that will include a poetry website, readings at more than 30 major public libraries across the country, a special Poets Laureate reading at the <B>Library of Congress</B>, and the distribution of 180,000 posters to bookstores, libraries and schools. Among the featured items at the website (<B><a href="http://www.poets.org">http://www.poets.org</a></B>) will be a chat room, a listing of prominent poetry awards and winners and links to related sites.

<P>National Poetry Month made its debut in 1996, when organizers say more than 4,000 schools, libraries, bookstores and community centers participated with readings, contests, projects and displays. The month was officially recognized by President Clinton, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other officials across the nation.

<P><CENTER><B><font color=green>BAY AREA LOVES INDEPENDENTS</font></B></CENTER>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> An informal survey of book consumers conducted at the <B>San Francisco Bay Area Book Festival</B> underscores the vitality of independent bookselling in Northern California. The survey asked, in part, where consumers bought books (independent bookstores or national chains) and what they liked best about buying from their preferred store.

<P>Independents were the primary source for 85% of the respondents, while 13% favored chains and 2% chose both options. Additionally, 60% of the consumers who preferred independents said that their bookstore has recommended a book to them, while the chain store recommended percentage was less than 10%. Most of those who completed the survey had special ordered a book and were pleased with the service provided. 

<P>When asked what they liked best about their preferred store, respondents who favored chain stores answered selection - 29%, price - 22% and convenient location - 12%. Respondents who favored independent bookstores answered selection - 45%, knowledge of books - 15%, support of local businesses - 13%, service - 12%, ambience/atmosphere - 12%, staff - 10%, and friendly people - 10%.

<P><CENTER><B><font color=green>GRAHAM SWIFT WINS BOOKER PRIZE</font></B></CENTER>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> <B>Graham Swift</B> won the 1996 Booker Prize for his comic novel, <B><I>Last Orders</I></B>. The prize was established in 1968 and honors the best novel written in English in Britian or one of its Commonwealth nations. The author, a 47-year old Londoner, collected a check for $32,000 at a ceremony to honor the winner.

<P><B><I>Last Orders</I></B> tells the story of four people who meet to carry out the dying wish of their friend, who asked that his ashes be scattered into the sea off the county of Kent.  The chairman of the Booker judges noted that "Choosing the winner was torture, but we finally settled on <B><I>Last Orders,</I></B> a wonderful book that will give great pleasure to thousands of people."

<P><IMG hspace=10 align=right width=100 height=179 SRC="image/nobel.gif" ALT="by Anna Baranczak">

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Polish poet <B>Wislawa Szymborska</B>, described as ``the Mozart of poetry,'' won the 1996 Nobel Prize in literature.  Szymborska, 73, lives in the Polish city of Krakow. Her work has appeared frequently in the<I> New Yorker</I>, and she was the inspiration for the movie ``Red.''

<P>Critics have described her as being both deeply political and witty at the same time. Her verse is marked by high seriousness, delightful inventiveness, a prodigal imagination, and enormous technical skill. Szymborska is regarded as one of the best representitives of Polish poetry since the second World War. 

<P>The Nobel citation describes her as ``the Mozart of poetry, not without justice in view of her wealth of inspiration and the veritable ease with which her words seem to fall into place.'' Her most recent book is 1993's ``The End and the Beginning,'' not yet translated into English. Works available in English include ``View With a Grain of Sand'' (Harcourt, Brace) ``People on a Bridge'' (Dufour) and ``Sounds, Feelings, Thoughts: Seventy Poems'' (Princeton).  For further information, please refer to the <B><a href="http://www.nobel.se/announcement-96/presseng96.html">Press Release </a></B> from the Nobel Prize Foundation.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> The Northern California Independent Booksellers Association - in association with <B>Heydey Books</B> - has published a guide to independent bookstores across Northern California. <B>First & Foremost: A Guide to Northern California's Independent Bookstores</B>, authored by local writer Charlene Akers, highlights more than 300 stores.

<P><CENTER><B><font color=green>WEB SITE OFFERS INDEPENDENT RECOMMENDATIONS</font></B></CENTER>

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> Former bookseller <B>Joan Call</B> has launched <B><a href=" http://www.independentreader.com">The Independent Reader</a></B>, a World Wide Web site offering book recommendations from 13 independent bookstores around the country. Each of the participating stores submits a recomendation in five different categories: new fiction, new non-fiction, softcover fiction, softcover non-fiction, and mysteries. The site then gathers the listings from each bookstore while adding extra information from publishers and building links to related internet sites. A sixth listing for a wildcard selection can also be found at The Independent Reader. Web surfers can view the recommended titles by store or by category, as well as print out a combined list of all recommended books.

<P>The site also includes a miniature home page for each bookstore detailing the store's philosophy, community involvement and current and past recommendations. Participating NCIBA stores are <B>Cody's Books</B> in Berkeley and <B>A Clean Well-Lighted Place for Books</B> in San Francisco. Other independent stores from around the country who are also featured on the site are Powell's Books in Portland, Oregon; Elliott Bay Books in Seattle; Tattered Cover in Denver; Prairie Lights in Iowa City; Women & Children First in Chicago; Hungry Mind in St. Paul; That Bookstore in Blytheville, Arkansas; Talking Leaves Books in Buffalo, New York;  Partners & Crime in New York City; Bunch of Grapes Bookstore in Martha's Vineyard; and Harvard Book Store in Cambridge.

<P><img width=21 height=13 src="image/book.gif"> The<B> Federal Trade Commission</B> has dropped its eight-year investigation into allegations that major publishing companies discriminated against independent booksellers by giving discounts to major bookstore chains. The FTC said the industry has changed so dramatically since 1988 - in part to private settlements between independents and publishing companies - that the investigation was no longer worth the time and expense.
