<p align="center"><b>USDA Issues &quot;White&quot; Paper On
Industrial Hemp: Report Concedes That American Hemp Cultivation
Isn't Likely Any Time Soon</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A recently released USDA &quot;white&quot; paper
indicates that the federal agency is currently exploring the
possibility of domestic hemp cultivation.&nbsp; The report notes
that a number of U.S. states reliant on the revenue raised
through tobacco farming have shown an interest in the possibility
of cultivating hemp as a way to compensate for slumping tobacco
sales.&nbsp; However, the report's conclusions demonstrate that
in spite of worldwide trends and renewed domestic interest in
hemp production, large-scale hemp cultivation will not begin in
the United States any time soon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the report, the USDA insists that, &quot;Production
and processing trials [are] needed to establish the economic
viability of industrial hemp production [within the United
States.]&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the report further notes that
neither can be permitted because &quot;legal issues currently preclude
[this] research&quot; from taking place.&nbsp; In sum the USDA
maintains that they cannot endorse the domestic production of
industrial hemp until field tests are conducted while
simultaneously noting that the DEA refuses to allow any actual
tests to take place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the report states that the DEA remains &quot;opposed to
any consideration of hemp as a legitimate fiber or pulp
product.&quot;&nbsp; The DEA justifies this position, not on the
basis of any agricultural or economic evidence, but on &quot;the
perception that industrial hemp advocates have a hidden agenda of
favoring the legalization of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; The report
further notes that current policy dictates &quot;that the White
House Drug Enforcement Office should be contact[ed] before USDA
staff attend meetings on industrial hemp or get involved with
research programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In essence, the federal government is allowing our nation's
policy toward an agricultural endeavor be determined -- not by an
agricultural agency -- but rather, by an anti-narcotics agency that
bases its reasoning upon the preconceived notion that any
advocacy of industrial hemp is also an endorsement of the
legalization of marijuana,&quot; states <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;For the American farmers
and businessmen who could potentially benefit from this growing
worldwide industry, the U.S. government's bias is unsupported and
truly shameful.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>An in depth look at the USDA report will be featured in the
forthcoming issue of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>'s Ongoing
Briefing.&nbsp; Copies of the 7 page report entitled
&quot;Industrial Hemp and other Alternative Crops for small-scale
Tobacco Producers,&quot; are presently available from </i><a

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Colorado Senator Set To
Introduce Legislation Allowing For Hemp Cultivation In Colorado</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A Colorado bill that would allow for the
regulated cultivation of industrial hemp by Colorado farmers is
expected to be submitted to the state legislature in 1996.&nbsp;
The bill, sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
permits the planting of no more than forty acres of industrial
hemp in Colorado for agricultural, commercial, and scientific
research. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A similar bill was introduced by Sen. Casey in 1995 but was
defeated.&nbsp; (A complete story of the hearings surrounding
Casey's previous hemp bill appeared in the Spring 1995 issue of <b>NORML</b>'s
Active Resistance.) <br>
