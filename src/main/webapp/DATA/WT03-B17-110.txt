<H1>AMAZON RIVER BASINS</H1>
<DL><DD><IMG Align=left SRC="abezel.gif" ALT="Compass Graphic">
How many divers have ever explored Nature's most diverse ecosystem? Of course, we are referring to the Amazon rainforest and the rivers that flow through it. Mad Dog Expeditions is breaking new ground by offering underwater expeditions to the Amazon. There are a few unique places where rainforest streams and small rivers have crystal-clear water. These amazing places represent windows through which the diver or snorkeler can be given a view of the underwater world of the Amazon. This expedition up the Rio Negro will present <IMG Align=right SRC="beachf.gif" ALT="Photo of Beachfront">participants with a rare opportunity not only to see incredible fishes and other aquatic animals, but also to explore rainforests, ramble through orchid communities, interact with local peoples, and explore one of the world's greatest rivers. All of this can be done without being attacked by mosquitoes, which are often the scourge of other Amazonian rivers. The Rio Negro supports few biting insects, thus the traveler is free to enjoy star-filled evenings or walk along moonlit beaches without giving up any blood.</DL>
<UL><BR><B>Observation:</B>
<UL>The <A href="destinf.html">main diving destination</A> is located several days upriver of Manaus. There are many wonderful things to see and explore, however, on the way upriver. <A href="itineraryf.html">Daily stops</A> to explore the rainforest will serve not only as an educational experience but also provide acclimatization  and conditioning in preparation for the long dives ahead.</UL>
<BR><B>Accomodations:</B>
<UL>The expedition will use two boats. The main boat is equipped with seven cabins, each of which has two beds and a private bathroom. The aft of the upper deck boasts a very comfortable open-air sitting and observation area complete with a well-equipped bar. The excellent cuisine draws from international and regional dishes.  A second boat will be used for diving equipment and guides.  Motorized canoes are used to travel up small tributaries and streams.</UL>
<BR><B>Exploring the Flooded Forests:</B>
<UL>The flooded forests of the Amazon are one of the great wonders of the tropics. When the floods come every year, an area about the size of Florida is <IMG  Align=left SRC="onriver.gif" ALT="Photo of Canoe">inundated. At this time of year, it is possible to canoe through the rainforest  making your way between giant trees. At the peak of the floods, river level has risen sufficiently that, seated in a canoe, you become perched in the rainforest canopy. This is a unique experience that could only be matched in upland forest by building miles of high scaffolding. Diving down you will see that the submerged understory of the flooded forest is alive and healthy.</UL>
<BR><B>In the Wild with Beautiful Aquarium Fish:</B>
<UL>The Rio Negro and its tributaries probably have the richest freshwater fish fauna in the world. There are probably more fish species in the Rio Negro <IMG Align=right SRC="fish.gif" ALT="Photo of Fish">basin than in all of North America. The Rio Negro is the most famous river in the Amazon for aquarium fishes. For reasons that are still not understood, blackwaters of the Amazon have led to the evolution of fishes with amazing color patterns. The neon cardinal is the most striking example, but there are also hatchetfishes, pencilfishes, and a myriad of brightly colored cichlids.</UL>
<BR><B>Details:</B>
<UL>September 30- October 14, including 2 days to and from Manaus in Brazil.
<UL><LI>$6,500 per person 12 nights double occupancy, all inclusive.</UL>
<UL><LI>$8,500 per person 12 nights single occupancy, all inclusive.<BR>
Unlimited diving while in clear water tributaries.</DL>
