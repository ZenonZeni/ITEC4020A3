<TITLE>Hi Perf, Lo Temp Bat</title>
<H3>High Performance, Low Temperature Batteries</h3><p>
<H5>Points of Contact:  S. Surampudi, Chen-Kuo Huang, and M. Smart</h5><p>
The major goal of this program is to develop advanced batteries for future Mars Exploration Missions.  Mars Exploratory Missions can be broadly classified into four types:  orbiters, landers, rovers and penetraters.  These missions have some common performance requirements, such as high specific energy and energy density due to mass and volume limitations.  However, each of these missions have some unique promary performance drivers, such as, long cycle capability (orbiters) and ability to operate at low temperatures (landers, rovers and penetraters).  The orbiters require a cycle life greater than 10000 cycles at 20-30% depth of discharge with a specific energy > 100 Wh/kg.  The landers and rovers require batteries that can provide > 120 Wh/kg and operate at ttemperatures -20 to 30oC, whereas, the cycle life requirement is < 500 cycles (50-70% DOD).  Penetraters require batteries that can operate at temperatures lower than -60oC and withstand high shock levels.<p>

The SOA Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries are quite heavy and bulky and cannot meet mass and volume requirements of future Mars missions.  Furthermore, they have very poor low temperature performance capability as they use aqueous electrolytes.  Rechargeable lithium batteries offer significant weight, volume and cost advantages compared to SOA Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries and are especially attractive for future Mars Missions.  The performance advantages include:  higher specific energy (2 to 3 times greater than Ni-Cd and Ni-H2), energy density (3-4 times greater than Ni-Cd and Ni-H2), higher cell voltage, coulombic and energy efficiency, low self-discharge rate, and lower battery costs compared to the SOA Ni-Cd and Ni-H2 batteries.  These advantages translate into several benefits for Mars Missions including: reduced weight and volume of the energy storage subsystem, improved reliability, extended mission life, and lower power system life cycle costs.<p>

the overall technical goal of this task is to develop advanced rechargeable lithium ion cells with improved cycle life and wide temperature performance capabilities for future Mars Exploratory Missions such as orbiters, landers, rovers, and penetraters.  The specific objectives of this task are: 1) Improve the cycle life performance of Lithium-ion cells and demonstrate the ability to meet life requirements of the Mars orbiters, 2) Improve the low temperature performance of lithium-ion cells and demonstrate their applicability to lander, rover and penetrater missions, 3) Design and fabricate higher capacity cells (> 10 Ah) with uniform capacity and predictable performance in association with US battery manufacturers, and 4) Establish effective charge methodology and reconditioning methods for on-board battery management.<p>

The proposed technical approach consists of three well defined subtasks:  1) chemistry and materials, 2) cell development, 3) testing and evaluation.  The prime objective of the chemistry and materials subtask is to develop advanced electrode materials and electrolytes that are capable of providing long cycle life and improved low temperature performance.  The objectives of the cell development subtask are:  a) develop methods for the fabrication of electrodes with uniform loading (to achieve cell matching and predictable performance), b) optimize cell design for improved cycle life and low temperature performance and c) fabricate higher capacity cells (5-20 Ah) for technology demonstration.  The objectives of the cell testing subtasks are: a) establish charge methods for effective battery management and b) determine the performance of cells at various mission operating and accelerated test conditions and demonstrate technological viability for various missions.  Assistance of an industrial patner will be sought for the fabrication of cell hardware.<p>
