<p><strong>Cleveland</strong> - The election of Dennis Kucinich in Ohio's
10th 
Congressional District was a ground-breaking event 
demonstrating the powerful political potential of a mass, 
grassroots coalition led by labor.</p>

<p>Trade unionists and seniors provided the largest numbers of 
some 5,000 volunteers but many others came from Hispanic, 
environmental, peace and other organizations. Some were 
unemployed workers or shoppers at the outdoor mall where the 
headquarters was located who just walked in and offered to 
help. On any day after early September there were probably 
100 people working for some period of time in the 
headquarters, a beehive of activity and camaraderie, where 
anyone could find plenty of baked goods, bagels and cream 
cheese and other snacks brought in by the volunteers.</p>

<p>According to the campaign staff, the volunteers canvassed at 
least 600 of the district's 750 precincts, some as many as 
four times. They turned the western half of Cuyahoga County 
and especially the west side of Cleveland into a sea of 
15,000 bright yellow yard signs reading "Light Up Congress! 
Elect Dennis Kucinich" - a reminder of the historic fight 
Kucinich had waged as Cleveland mayor when he refused to 
sell the city-owned power plant to a private electric 
company.</p>

<p>The staff estimated that the volunteers made 100,000 phone 
calls and mailed out one million pieces of literature. Many 
organizations issued their own literature and did their own 
mailings including the AFL-CIO's Labor '96, the UAW CAP 
Council, the Sierra Club, Peace Voter '96, gay rights and 
senior groups. The United Auto Workers and the Steelworkers 
did plantgate distributions. The Ohio Council of Senior 
Citizens distributed 12,000 pieces with the positions of 
Kucinich and his opponent, incumbent Martin Hoke, on senior 
issues to senior buildings, nutrition sites and bingo games. 
This was after the National Council of Senior Citizens and 
the Cleveland AFL-CIO Retiree Council mailed voter 
registration and absentee ballot forms to 16,000 union 
retirees.</p>

<p>The coalition embraced many political viewpoints: Democrats, 
independents, Greens, socialists, Communists, members of the 
Labor Party, even some disgruntled Republicans. Democratic 
Party figures, including First Lady Hillary Clinton, 
Congressmen Louis Stokes, Joseph Kennedy and Barney Franks 
visited Cleveland to help in the effort. Especially 
significant were visits by Congresspersons Luis Gutierrez 
and Nydia Velazquez who spoke to large meetings and rallies 
and on the radio mobilizing an unprecedented vote in the 
Hispanic community.</p>

<p>But it was the grassroots, labor-community coalition that 
Kucinich had in mind on election night when he gave his 
impassioned victory speech with jubilant leaders of 
organized labor standing behind him, their right fists held 
high, chanting, "We are the party of the people! We are the 
party of the people!" The coalition was inspired by both 
Kucinich's personality and his program. </p>

<p>Respected as a champion of the underdog and working people, 
Kucinich was the son of a truck driver, who grew up in 
extreme poverty even living for a time out of the family 
car. As mayor, he had battled the power structure, the 
utilities, the banks, the mass media and, although his 
efforts saved the city light plant, he had waged the fight 
alone with no organized base and was ruthlessly crushed 
after the banks retaliated, forcing the city into default.</p>

<p>Despite years of ostracism and ridicule in the media, 
Kucinich staged a dramatic comeback in 1994, when he was 
elected to the state senate, one of the only Democrats in 
the country to unseat an incumbent Republican in the year of 
the Gingrich "revolution." At a time when other candidates 
of his party believed they should move to the right and fell 
like flies, Kucinich declared himself to be a Roosevelt 
Democrat and championed the views of an emerging left-
center, labor-community coalition.</p>

<p>In the state legislature he spoke out on behalf of this 
growing coalition, leading fights against privatization, the 
locating of a nuclear waste dump in Ohio, and the cutting of 
badly needed services to seniors and Hispanics. With the 
AFL-CIO mobilizing to defeat the Gingrich gang in Congress, 
it was only natural that Kucinich's campaign would become a 
national rallying point.</p>

<p>Unlike many other Democrats whom labor supported as "lesser 
evils," Kucinich raised the stakes. He issued a bill of 
rights for working people stating his belief that people 
have a right to a job, a right to a safe workplace, to 
decent wages and benefits, to strike, to participate freely 
in the political process. Issued on glossy paper with a 
bright yellow background, the program was distributed 
throughout the labor movement and posted on union bulletin 
boards everywhere.</p>

<p>The Republicans reacted with fury to this open challenge to 
their decades of labor-baiting bully tactics. Kucinich's 
program, Republican county chairman Jim Trakas announced, is 
"very similar to the Communist Manifesto" and is "what Lenin 
stood for." Kucinich blasted this reversion to 
"McCarthyism."</p>

<p>Martin Hoke, a loutish multi-millionaire, had been lucky to 
face seriously wounded opponents in his two previous races. 
He had unseated Mary Rose Oakar in 1992 when the longtime 
Congresswoman was embroiled in the House banking and post 
office "scandals." In 1994 he faced County Treasurer Francis 
Gaul, the focus of blame for the collapse of a key bond 
fund. Hoke, as Kucinich was fond of saying, was a man who 
woke up one day on third base and thought he had hit a 
triple.</p>

<p>After the 1994 elections, Hoke jumped on the Gingrich 
bandwagon with a vengeance, championing the Contract on 
America, denouncing labor, federal social programs and 
efforts to raise the minimum wage while skipping important 
votes for photo opportunities with the House Speaker.</p>

<p>At first Hoke adopted an upbeat, positive posture, with TV 
ads showing him fraternizing with workers and playing the 
piano for senior citizens. But as an AFL-CIO television 
campaign exposed his ultra-right voting record and 
positions, he found himself trailing by eight to ten points. 
The mask was then removed and the phony smile replaced with 
the snarl of labor-baiting and character assassination. 
Voicing his class hatred, Hoke assailed "Washington labor 
bosses" who, he said, were "stealing their members' dues" to 
"run a campaign of lies and smears" against him.</p>

<p>In fact, It was Hoke's campaign that degenerated into lies 
and smears as he saturated TV with ads slandering Kucinich's 
role as mayor and wildly charging that his health care 
proposals would bankrupt the country. When Rep. Barney Frank 
appeared for a Kucinich fundraiser, Hoke falsely charged 
that Kucinich advocated homosexual marriage and scurrilous, 
unsigned leaflets were distributed at churches, charging 
that Kucinich's supporters favored sex with children and 
animals.</p>

<p>The smears were endlessly propagated by a right-wing talk 
show host who made it his mission three hours every morning 
to stop Kucinich. The poisonous attacks, aimed at 
suppressing voter turnout, caused the race to tighten 
considerably. In the final week before the election the 
focus of the Hoke campaign shifted to virulent red-baiting 
directed at this writer.</p>

<p>In what was probably a first since the beginning of the Cold 
War, Kucinich refused to knuckle under, calmly stating that 
I was one of 5,000 volunteers and declaring, "It's Halloween 
and Hoke is dressing up as Joe McCarthy. Karl Marx is not 
running my campaign but apparently Harpo Marx is running 
his." </p>

<p>On Nov. 5 Hoke was defeated by a vote of 108,000 to 
102,000 with 10,000 going to a candidate of the Natural Law 
Party. It was a stunning rebuke to Hoke's shameful attempt 
to whip up hatred and hysteria. Although he spent a million 
dollars - over twice as much as Kucinich - he could not 
shake the solid majority of voters who showed outstanding 
maturity.</p>

<p>Unable to accept defeat gracefully, he never actually 
conceded and the next day denounced what he claimed was a 
"war that John Sweeney and the AFL-CIO declared on the 
people of America." The "war," he whined, will continue 
because the Republicans, although seriously weakened, retain 
control of Congress. While the war was hardly declared by 
labor, it is certain that labor and its allies will continue 
their efforts to reverse the nearly two decades of assault 
on unions and all that is decent in this country, and they 
will be able to count on the staunch, heart-felt support of 
Congressman Dennis Kucinich.</p>
