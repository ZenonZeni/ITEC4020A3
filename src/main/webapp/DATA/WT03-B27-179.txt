<H2>Customer Q&A: <BR>
Dun & Bradstreet FAQs
</h2>

This month we took your most "frequently asked questions" about the Dun & Bradstreet Gateway to Jean Fitzgerald, D&B Representative.  Jean provided the following answers.<P>

<i><b>Q.  When I access a D&B report, I am asked to enter an endorsement.  What should I enter?<P></i></b>
<b>A. </b>The endorsement field is a convenience for the user.  It is a way to identify the report for future reference.  Simply enter your name, department, or the person who is requesting the report.<P>

<i><b>Q. What do the suffixes next to the D-U-N-S  Number mean?</i></b><P>
<B>A. </B>When the list of company names matching your search criteria is displayed, one of the following suffixes may be appended to a D-U-N-S Number. The suffixes identify the type of report you retrieved.<BR>
B --  Branch location<BR>
T --  The company name you see is a trade style.  The report will print under the company's legal name.<BR>
D -- A D-U-N-S Number has been assigned to this company but Dun & Bradstreet has not conducted a full investigation on it.  Therefore, the report is not available.<BR>
Z, I --  The report for this company contains information that is too old and is therefore unavailable.<BR>
<P>
<B><I>Q. If a Business Information Report is not available, does that mean the Payment Analysis Report is not available also?<P></b></i>
<B>A. </b>No.  The information on these reports comes from a third party source.  It is possible to have payment information and/or family tree information about a company and not have a current Business Information Report.
<P>
<B><I>Q. If a foreign company has locations in the United States, will I be able to retrieve those U.S. locations?</i></b><P>
<B>A. </b>Yes.  Because of Dun & Bradstreet's unique D-U-N-S Numbering system, each corporate family member has its own D-U-N-S Number.  This means each member has its own unique report.  If they are located in the U.S., they are in the U.S. database and therefore available.
<P>
<b><i>Q. If I order the combination of both the Business Information Report and the Payment Analysis Report (BP), will they come out separately or together?<P></b></i>
<B>A. </b>Two separate reports will come out in response to one command. That is, when you select number 3, BP, you will access both reports; the BIR followed by the PAR.
