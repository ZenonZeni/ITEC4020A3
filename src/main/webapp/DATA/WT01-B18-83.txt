INTRODUCTION TO REPORT





NOTE: This is the actual introduction to the report



This report contains information on the latest treatments and on related 

current findings for Renal Cell Carcinoma, particularly (but not 

exclusively) recurred RCC.  It was gathered from a number of computer 

databases.  It is divided into sections as described below.







SECTION 1a. Outline of  Renal Cell Carcinoma



This section is a strait-forward summary of Renal Cell Carcinoma in lay 

person language.  It includes a general introduction that will help you 

understand your condition as well as information on staging , and 

prognosis.  This section  is from the National Cancer Institute’s 

Physician’s Data Query (PDQ) database.







SECTION 1b. Technical Outline of  Renal Cell Carcinoma



This section, also from PDQ, is a more technical and more detailed 

summary of Renal Cell Carcinoma.  It is designed for physicians and 

other medical professionals.  While non-physicians will probably not be 

able to understand this section in its entirety, much of the information 

can be understood by a lay person prepared to read it carefully.  A good 

medical dictionary might be helpful for this section and for most of the 

following sections.







SECTION 2. Current and Recent Clinical Trials



This section contains specific details on current clinical trials for 

Renal Cell Carcinoma.  



There are well over 1000 clinical trials taking place in the United 

States at any given time.  Reputable clinical trials take place in other 

nation's throughout the world as well.  In this and in virtually all 

other nations, a new treatment must be extensively tested and evaluated 

in laboratories and then on animals, before it is used for humans.  



This sections begins with a brief explanation of clinical trials.







SECTION 3. Latest Findings from Cancerlit, Renal Cell Carcinoma



This section contains references and summary information from recent 

studies involving Renal Cell Carcinoma.  This information can be useful 

to:



a. examine the reported effectiveness of clinical trials (such as those 

found in section II. of this report)



b. evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment or treatments that your 

doctor is proposing.  For example, it is one thing to be told by your 

doctor that your chances for complete remission are pretty good with 

treatment XYZ but another to read that a in recent study of 50 people 

with Renal Cell Carcinoma who were treated with XYZ, 75% achieved 

complete remission at 6 months.



c. compare effectiveness and risk of one treatment option to another.  

This is useful in deciding whether the treatment that your doctor is 

proposing is more or less effective than other standard treatments or 

treatments in clinical trial that may be available.



Note that the final line on each summary (starting with AD) indicates 

the institution where that particular report came from.  Cancerlit 

includes information from the USA and the entire world.







SECTION 4. Information on Alternative and Non-Traditional Medicine in 

Regards to Renal Cell Carcinoma.



This section, from the Cancerlit Database, includes  research findings  

available specifically for non-traditional treatments and related 

reports dealing with Renal Cell Carcinoma or related cancers.  The 

following types of medicine were searched (by National Library of 

Medicine Medical Subject Headings and text word where no MESH heading 

was available).





Alternative Medicine			Medicine, Herbal

Medicine, African Traditional		Medicine, Oriental Traditional

Medicine, Arabic			Medicine, Ayurvedic

Homeopathy				drugs, Chinese Herbal

Chiropractic				antineoplaston (S Burzynski)

bovine cartilage			shark cartilage



Note that only items specifically indexed under one of these heading 

will be retrieved as part of this section.   Also, we do not limit our 

search to human treatment and clinical experimentation here as we do in 

the previous sections because people often want to know about early 

stage (pre-human trial) alternative medicine experimentation.  Other 

treatment reports that fall under the domain of alternative or non-

traditional may be included in one of the previous sections.







SECTION 5. Information from National Organization of Rare Disorders 

(NORD)



NORD is a non-profit organization dedicated to identifying, controlling, 

and curing rare or Orphan Diseases.  The information it offers includes 

overviews, new treatments, and sources of further information for many 

rare (and some not-so-rare) cancers.  The organization is largely 

supported by pharmaceutical companies so not surprisingly, most of the 

treatments are drug based.  



If we found Renal Cell Carcinoma in the NORD database, their information 

is included in this section.







SECTION 6. Medical Libraries In Your Area



There are many medical libraries and general libraries with medical 

sections.  Some of these libraries in your area and their addresses  are 

listed in this section.



Medical libraries are designed more for medical professionals than for 

patients.  Their policies on use by the public vary so it is worth 

checking before taking a long trip only to be denied access.  



Medical libraries are the best place to search for the full text of 

articles that are included in this report in summary (abstract) fashion.  

The libraries listed here work with the National Library of Medicine’s 

system of sharing resources.  This means that any one of them should be 

able to track down any journal referenced by the NLM (Cancerlit section 

of this report).  Whether they will use their sharing capabilities for 

you depends on the libraries policies.







.c2.  THE BEST DOCTOR



People with cancer often ask, "Who is the best doctor for my illness?"  

Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to this question.  However, it is 

fair to reason that a doctor whose name comes up several times in this 

report is well versed and up to date on Renal Cell Carcinoma.  That is, 

if Dr. John Doe is participating in several clinical trials (section 2 

and/or has published several articles on this illness (section 3 or 4), 

Dr. Doe is very likely to be an expert on the treatment of Renal Cell 

Carcinoma.  The clinical trials listings include the names, addresses, 

and phone numbers for listed participants.







.c2.If The President Had Cancer...



If The President Had Cancer  is a step by step guide for patients who 

want to make sure they get the best care available and who want to take 

more control of their care.  It includes information on finding 

information, getting a second opinion from top specialists in your type 

of cancer, questions to ask your doctor, and more.  For further 

information, see the enclosed brochure.

 







1a. OUTLINE OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA 



  

                      DESCRIPTION

-- What is renal cell cancer? --



Renal cell cancer (also called cancer of the kidney or renal 

adenocarcinoma) is

a disease in which cancer (malignant) cells are found in certain tissues 

of the

kidney.  Renal cell cancer is one of the less common kinds of cancer.  

It

occurs more often in men than in women....



In an actual report, thisoverview continues for several pages.  







1b. TECHNICAL OUTLINE OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA



 DIAGNOSIS #1 OF 1                      10/19/95 12:0                       

                               RENAL CELL CANCER

                                   PROGNOSIS

Renal cell cancer, also called renal adenocarcinoma, or hypernephroma, 

can often be cured if it is diagnosed and treated when still localized 

to the kidney and to immediately surrounding tissue.  The probability of 

cure is directly related to the stage or degree of tumor dissemination.  

Even when regional lymphatics or blood vessels are involved with tumor, 

a significant number of patients can achieve prolonged survival and 

probable cure.....  



In an actual report, this technical overview continues for several 

pages.  







.c.2a. CURRENT CLINICAL TRIALS (from PDQ) 

 



.c2.  HOW CLINICAL TRIALS WORK



Virtually all U.S. clinical trials are performed only with the approval 

of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and according to strict FDA 

guidelines.  Also, most clinical trials must first be approved by an 

Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the institution where the trial is 

to take place.  The IRB, which is composed of physicians, scientists, 

and others reviews the study to assure that it is well designed and that 

it includes appropriate safeguards for the patients, and that the 

potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Clinical trials are 

carefully reviewed for medical ethics, patient safety, and scientific 

merit by the organization that is sponsoring the research.  As with the 

practice of medicine in general, a key ethical tenant must be observed: 

nothing shall be done to a patient that will knowingly do any harm that 

is not outweighed by a greater benefit.



A clinical trial must have a clear and potentially helpful purpose with 

clear evaluation criteria and clear steps in its administration.  In 

many instances effectiveness in destroying or abating cancer relative to 

standard therapies is being tested.  In some cases effectiveness of two 

or more drugs has been proven to be similar but relative toxicities need 

to be evaluated.



While the heavy scrutiny that a clinical trial receives does not 

guarantee that every trial is absolutely safe, it is at least very 

significant protection against carelessness and undue risk under the 

circumstances.  In all cases you will receive information about the 

potential benefits and hazards and you will not be admitted to a 

clinical trial until and unless you consent in writing to be part of 

that trial.  Even with your written consent, you can leave the clinical 

trial at any time and for any reason or for no reason at all.







CLINICAL TRIAL PHASES



Trials in cancer research in this country are designed in 4 phases with 

each phase building upon what was learned in the previous phase.  Not 

all trials make it through all 4 phases if the value is called into 

question by early data.  Also, some clinical trials are allowed to 

forego phases 3 if earlier results are particularly promising.  Each 

clinical trial listed in this report lists which phase it is currently 

in.  The phases are outlined as follows:



Phase I



In this phase a new drug is first administered to humans.  Because the 

drug is new to humans, risks are highest here.  Part of the researchers 

job is to determine the best way to administer the drug, appropriate 

dosage, and of course to carefully monitor side effects.  Only people 

with advanced disease who could not be helped by other known treatment 

are typically allowed to participate in this potentially perilous phase.



Phase II



In this phase, access is opened up to more patients.  Patients with 

related forms of cancer may be admitted into trials that have 

successfully passed through phase I without undue side effects.



Phase III



The key to this phase is comparison of the new treatment with other 

treatments.  The group getting the new treatment is called the treatment 

group and the group getting the standard treatment is called the control 

group.  Where there is no existing treatment, some patients get the 

treatment and the control group gets no treatment at all.  This is 

typically done through randomization  meaning patients are randomly 

assigned to the treatment or control group. While this is good science 

it unfortunately means some patients get a treatment that may not be as 

good as other patients are getting.  For this reason, the FDA sometimes 

permits this phase to be skipped if there is clear evidence that the 

investigational treatment is better than the existing alternatives (or 

lack thereof).



Phase IV



A treatment that makes it into phase IV has pretty much proven its 

value.  Although the FDA continues to monitor its benefits and toxicity,  

it becomes a standard treatment option until and unless new data 

uncovers unforeseen problems.  Sometimes it is used in conjunction with 

other proven drugs, and sometimes it is initially approved for use if 

established treatments have not been effective with a particular 

patient.



Before a drug is approved by the FDA as a standard treatment, that 

agency  reviews all the clinical trial data.  This is a lengthy process 

taking at least a year and sometimes much more.  In fact, it can easily 

take 5 to 10 years from the point where an investigational drug is first 

administered to a patient to the time it is fully approved by the FDA.







NCI GROUP C TREATMENT PROTOCOLS



Group C treatments are drugs provided to physicians by the NCI for 

treatment of individual patients.  Drugs in this category have been FDA 

approved for treatment of specific cancers.  They have passed through 

extensive clinical trials (at lease through phase II.) and show 

considerable promise.  If all goes according to expectation, these drugs 

will soon be approved for commercialization.







INFORMATION ON EACH TRIAL



Each trial description contains the following information:



-name of institution(s) where trial is taking place

-name of at least one researcher (participant) involved in the study

-address of participant(s)  and institution including the lead 

organization in all cases.  Also, the names and addresses of 

participants in your state and nearby states are included in a separate 

list following the first listing.

-entry criteria (physical characteristics such as age, condition, 

gender, etc. for eligibility to participate as a patient)

-status- all clinical trials listed here are active

-Objectives- The medical objectives are detailed in each summary 

contained in the report.  Note that these are the objectives from a 

research point-of-view, not for your point of view as a person with 

cancer.  Your objective is clearer and simpler-- to either fully or 

partially cure your illness.  Don’t be put off by the cold scientific 

language of the description of the objective.  The improvement of 

quality of life for the patient is understood as the human objective and 

does not need stating in the scientific summary of objectives.



-Summary-  Finally, each trial listed has a summary that describes the 

trial itself in a few paragraphs.  Again, this is written for medical 

professionals but it will give you an idea of what you will go through 

if you enter any of the trials listed. 





FOREIGN CLINICAL TRIALS



It is possible that one or more current clinical trials are not included 

in the PDQ database and therefore are not listed in this section.  This 

is especially likely for clinical trials taking place outside the U.S, 

even though a number of foreign trials are included. 







GETTING MORE INFORMATION ON CLINICAL TRIALS



Don’t hesitate to ask your doctor to  call or write one of the 

researchers (listed as participants in each description) for further 

information about the trial and about your own eligibility for 

participating.  If your doctor is hesitant, by all means contact the 

researchers yourself.



Section III.  (Latest Findings From Cancerlit) of this report contains 

information on recent studies involving Renal Cell Carcinoma.  Some of 

that information may include results of the clinical trials mentioned in 

the PDQ list of trials.





If the President Had Cancer (available through Schine On-line Services) 

contains more details on clinical trials.



note: This listing contains clinical trials taking place worldwide.  

Following this listing, those clinical trials from this complete list 

that are available in your state and nearby states are listed separately 

with the names of local participants.







2b. CLINICAL TRIALS LISTING



NOTE:    There were a total of 53 clinical trials listed in this 

particular report (for a person age 48 with recurred Renal Cell 

Carcinoma ).  One is included here as an example.



NOTE: This listing includes trials which may be available to persons age 

48 with recurred Renal Cell Carcinoma.



NOTE: Details regarding dosages are not included.  Note that the same 

trials may use different dosages in different combinations.  Information 

on dosages for any trials will be forwarded at no additional charge, 

upon your request.

3. Latest Findings From Cancerlit/Medline



Note: This section contains very recent studies and reports on the 

treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma.  This important information can help 

you evaluate different  treatment options and make treatment choices 

based upon hard scientific  information (i.e. which treatment seems to 

offer a higher possibility of full  cure, which has the lowest risk of 

adverse effects, etc.).  Also, if there have been recent breakthroughs 

in the treatment of your illness, this section  is likely to contain 

that late-breaking information.  It is not easy for a lay person to 

understand this information, but it can increase your chances of long  

term survival.  We advise clients to read through the studies and circle 

those that look promising.  With the appropriate items circled, take the 

report to your doctor for help in determining which of the items are 

worth following up on.  One of fifty-five treatment reports is included 

in this sample.  This information is not available through Cancernet, 

Oncolink or any other free on-line services.

two as NC and four as PD. One out of two patients with estrogen receptor 

(ER)-positive tumors and three out of four patients with ER-negative 

tumors responded favorably to this treatment.  Side effects observed 

during treatment included nausea and vomiting (Grade I in three patients 

and Grade II in five), leukopenia (Grade II in four patients and Grade 

III in two), Grade II liver dysfunction in two patients, and slight 

pigmentation in two patients.  This treatment can be considered 

efficacious for renal cell carcinoma.

4. Information on Alternative and Non-Traditional Medicine in Regards to 

Renal Cell Carcinoma



Note that only items specifically indexed under one of the headings 

noted in the introduction for section 4, will be retrieved as part of 

this section.  Also, we do not limit our search to human treatment and 

clinical experimentation here as we do in the previous sections because 

people often want to know about early stage (pre-human trial) 

alternative medicine experimentation.  Other treatment reports that fall 

under the domain of alternative or non-traditional may be included in 

one of the previous sections.

      carcinoma.

SO  - Cancer Biother; 9(2):153-61 1994

AB  - Tumors are known to produce factors suppressing immune functions.  

We previously showed that a murine renal cell carcinoma (Renca) 

suppressed macrophage function in vitro and that this suppression was 

abolished by co-incubation with extracts of two Chinese medicinal herbs.  

We now report that these phytochemicals are capable of inhibiting growth 

of Renca in vivo.  BALB/c mice were transplanted intraperitoneally (IP) 

with 1-2 x 10(5) Renca cells.  One day after tumor transplant, mice were 

randomized into two groups.  One group was treated IP, daily for 10 

days, with 100 microliters of phytochemicals containing 500 micrograms 

each of Astragalus membranaceus and Ligustrum lucidum, while the other 

group received saline as controls.  A cure rate of 57% was obtained with 

these phytochemicals when the initial tumor load was 2 x 10(5), and 100% 

when the initial tumor load was 1 x 10(5).  Additional experiments were 

performed to investigate the mechanisms involved in this protection.  

Splenic macrophages from tumor-bearing mice were shown to have depressed 

chemiluminescent oxidative burst activity, and this depression was 

restored with phytochemical treatment.  Splenocytes from mice 

transplanted with Renca responded less favorably to interleukin-2 (IL-2) 

in generating lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells; again this 

depression was restored with phytochemical treatment.  Our data suggest 

that these phytochemicals may have exerted their antitumor effects via 

augmentation of phagocyte and LAK cell activities.
