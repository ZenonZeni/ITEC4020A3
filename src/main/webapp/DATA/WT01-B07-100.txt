<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of deliberate modification of electrode surfaces has been well established [1]. The use of ionomers in electrode modification, introduced by Anson and Oyama [2], provides an elegantly simple approach. With ionomer coated
electrodes, one can immobilize a wide range of ionic electroactive compounds. The 
ionomeric systems used include poly(vinyl pyridine) [2], quarternized poly(vinyl pyridine) [3], poly(vinyl sulfate) [3], and Nafion(R) [4]. Of these, Nafion(R) system has been used extensively.<P>
Much recent attention has been given to new materials for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, and this has led to the development of an inexpensive ionomer system using sulfonated Kraton G1650  (styrene/ ethylene butylene/ styrene block copolymer)[5].The rich array of microphase separated morphologies of block copolymers provides one with an opportunity to link good ionic conductivity through water swellable microdomains with low material cost and desirable mechanical properties. We have found that redox-active cations are easily exchanged into the sulfonated block copolymer films. This preprint describes some preliminary results obtained from studies using this material as a coating for applications involving chemically modified
electrodes.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>EXPERIMENTAL</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="products.htm"><B>Sulfonated Kraton 
G1650</B></A> in alcohol solution form was a gift from the DAIS corporation. Ferrocenyl methyl trimethyl ammonium iodide was obtained from Strem Chemicals. Methyl viologen dichloride was obtained from Aldrich. The cyclic voltammetric studies were carried out with the aid of an EG&G PARC Model 173 potentiostat/galvanostat coupled with the EG&G PARC 175 Universal Programmer  and 
EG&G PARC 179 coulometer. The initial experiments were carried out on platinum electrodes (Bioanalytical Systems). There was some problem with adhesion of the polymer film to the electrode upon swelling in water. Hence thereafter modification of glassy carbon electrodes (GCE from Bioanalytical Systems) was carried out.<P>
The general procedure used in the voltammetric experiments was as follows. The electrode was polished with alumina powder and rinsed with distilled water. The electrode was then cleaned ultrasonically. The polymer, in the sulfonic acid form, was cast on the electrode from a 5wt% alcohol solution.  The polymer film was neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and then electroactive cations were exchanged into the ionomeric coating on the electrode.  Loading of the cations was followed amperometrically.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>RESULTS &amp DISCUSSION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kinds of electroactive species were used to investigate the behavior of the ionomer-modified electrodes, ferrocenylmethyl trimethyl ammonium ion and methyl viologen. <a name=fig1><A HREF="p1fig1.htm"> Figure 1</A> shows the loading curve for the ferrocenylmethyl trim ethyl ammonium ion, wherein the magnitude of the peak current correlates to the amount present in the polymer film. It can be inferred that saturation occurs in
about 4 hours.<P>
<a name=fig2><A HREF="p1fig2.htm"> Figure 2</A> is the cyclic voltammogram obtained when ferrocenylmethyl trimethyl ammonium ion is immobilized in the ionomer. The peak separation observed is 63 mV, which is very close to the expected value of 59 mV for a reversible system. <a  name=fig3><A HREF="p1fig3.htm"> Figure 3</A> shows the dependence of peak current on the scan rate with which the potential is ramped. The linearity of the plot implies that the charge transport inside the ionomeric film is diffusion controlled.<P> 
<a name=fig4><A HREF="p1fig4.htm"> Figures 4</A> shows the voltammetric behavior of a methyl viologen-loaded film, one at a lower scan rate (20 mV/s) and the other at a higher scan rate (200 mV/s). As can be seen from these figures, the width of the first oxidation peak depends on the scan rate. <a name=fig5><A HREF="p1fig5.htm"> Figure 5</A> shows the time dependence of broadening at a scan rate of 200 mV/s. We propose that the time and scan rate dependent broadening of the first oxidation peak may be the result of the much greater hydrophobicity of the two-electron reduction product, which may diffuse into the hydrophobic domains of the block polymer provided that sufficient time is given. The neutral species thus transported might have a different formal potential than one residing in
the sulfonated, hydrophilic domain. It is worth noting that not all neutral species will diffuse at the same rate. Thus, the electrode would "see" a mixture of species with different formal potentials and hence the broadening of the peak. The time dependence of the reduction in broadening is under investigation.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3><P> 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feasibility of the use of sulfonated poly hydrocarbon ionomer has been
demonstrated. The electrochemical kinetics of the redox-active species within
the ionomer depends strongly on the type of the electroactive species. The redox 
behavior of methyl viologen may shed light on the internal domains of our ionomeric
system. Further experiments, which are in progress in our lab, will offer 
details about the charge and mass transport within the ionomer.</FONT>
