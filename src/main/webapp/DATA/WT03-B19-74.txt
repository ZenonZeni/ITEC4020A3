<h3>Scream to the Supremes:<br>
 I Want to Live!</h3>
<p>
Will Dr. Kevorkian & Company be the Ghost of Christmases to Come?
<p>
God help us, one and all.
<p> We may get a sign, however, on Wednesday, January 8, when the
U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments on two laws banning doctors
from killing patients, euphemistically known as assisted suicide.
<p>
While the suits, skirts and black robes conduct their formal ritual
inside, thousands of people with disabilities and our supporters --
including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop -- will be
rallying on the steps outside. The message:
<p>
<b><i>WE WANT TO LIVE!</i></b>
<p>
Organized by Not Dead Yet, and fast growing grassroots protest
movement against laws and attitudes that will snuff out the lives
of people with disabilities, this protest on the Court steps is one
of SUPREME IMPORTANCE. This is your life -- love it or lose it.
<p>
Get involved. Write personal letters to the nine Supremes
themselves. Tell them <b>you want to live</b> -- independent, well
and free.
