<p><font size="4">Has the Drug War Created an Officer Liars'
Club?</font><font size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph D. McNamara</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Los Angeles Times - February 11, 1996</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Are the nation's police officers a bunch of
congenital liars?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Not many people took defense attorney Alan M.
Dershowitz seriously when he charged that Los Angeles cops are
taught to lie at the birth of their careers at the Police
Academy. But as someone who spent 35 years wearing a police
uniform, I've come to believe that hundreds of thousands of
law-enforcement officers commit felony perjury every year
testifying about drug arrests.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These are not cops who take bribes or commit
other crimes. Other than routinely lying, they are law-abiding
and dedicated. They don't feel lying under oath is wrong because
politicians tell them they are engaged in a &quot;holy war&quot;
fighting evil. Then, too, the &quot;enemy&quot; these mostly
white cops are testifying against are poor blacks and Latinos.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The federal government reports that more than
1.3 million drug arrests were made in 1994, 480,000 of which
involved marijuana. About 1 million of the total drug arrests
were for possession, not selling. Despite government drug-war
propaganda that big-time dealers are its targets, only 24% of the
total drug arrests were for selling. Almost all those arrested
for selling are small-timers, in large part, supporting their own
drug use. Often they are inveigled by undercover police to up the
ante. Many of the arrests for selling are made without search
warrants and almost all the possession arrests are without
warrants.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In other words, hundreds of thousands of police
officers swear under oath that the drugs were in plain view or
that the defendant gave consent to a search. This may happen
occasionally but it defies belief that so many drug users are
careless enough to leave illegal drugs where the police can see
them or so dumb as to give cops consent to search them when they
possess drugs. But without this kind of police testimony. the
evidence would be excluded under a 1961 U.S. Supreme Court
decision, Mapp vs. Ohio.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I became a New York City policeman five years
before the Mapp decision. We were trained to search people who
appeared suspicious. I questioned the apparent contradiction
posed by the 4th Amendment, which guaranteed that people would be
secure in their person and house from a search without a warrant.
The instructor said not to worry. A suspect could sue in a civil
action but no jury would find against a cop trying to stop dope
from being sold. He went on to say that if the courts really
meant it, they wouldn't allow such evidence into a criminal
trial. In its Mapp decision, the Supreme Court cited this police
attitude and the routine violations of the 4th Amendment as
reasons enough to establish a national rule to exclude illegally
obtained evidence. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Gradually, as police professionalization
increased, police testimony became more honest. But the trend
reversed in 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon declared a war
against drugs and promised the nation that drug abuse would soon
vanish. Succeeding presidents and Congresses repeated this false
pledge despite evidence that drug use, drug profits, and drug
violence increased regardless of expanded enforcement and harsher
penalties. Because the political rhetoric described a holy war in
which evil had to be defeated, questioning police tactics was
equivalent to supporting drug abuse. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Leaders of the drug war dehumanize their
&quot;enemy&quot;-not just foreign drug traffickers but also
American users. This mentality pushes the police into making ever
more arrests. Arrests that can only survive in court because of
perjured police testimony. The fact that enforcement falls most
heavily on people of color also encourages illegal police
tactics.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Non-whites are arrested at four to five times
the rates whites are arrested for drug crimes, regardless of the
fact that 80% of drug crimes are committed by whites. The
&quot;war&quot; dehumanizes the cops as well as those they
pursue.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The eroding integrity of law-enforcement
officers and the resulting decrease in public credibility are
costs of the drug war yet to be acknowledged. Within the last few
years, police departments in Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans,
San Francisco, Denver, New York and in other large cities have
suffered scandals involving police personnel lying under oath
about drug evidence. Some officers in the New York City police
and New York State police departments were convicted of
falsifying drug evidence. Yet, President Bill Clinton appointed
the heads of those agencies to be drug czar and chief of the Drug
Enforcement Agency, respectively, and they were confirmed in the
Senate. The message that politicians seem to be sending to the
nation's police chiefs is that we understand that police perjury
is a part of the drug war.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But recently a number of police leaders have
conceded that racially disparate arrest rates and illegal police
searches and testimony are a problem. Last year, for example, New
York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton warned his officers
not to lie about how they obtained evidence, saying that he would
rather they lose the case than commit perjury. Last month,
Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier ordered his cops
to stop arresting drug users and to concentrate on criminals
committing gun crimes and other violence.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The vast majority of police forces are still
being pushed into waging a war against drugs by politicians who
ignore history and mislead the public into believing such a war
can be won. Consequently, hundreds of thousands of illegal police
searches take place and are lied about in court while drug-war
hawks pontificate about the immorality of people putting certain
kinds of chemicals into their bloodstream.<br>
