Energy Conservation
on the Internet

If you aren't a netsurfer yet, it may be time to try out the
Information Superhighway. According to Jon Schupp, co-author of the
just-published Energy Guide to the Internet (UDI/McGraw-Hill), a
growing number of energy companies, trade associations,
professional societies, research centers, academic institutions,
and regulatory agencies have gone "online" in hopes of capitalizing
on the Internet's tremendous potential.

Through their own Internet "home pages" on the World Wide Web,
these forward-thinking companies and organizations are giving
potential customers easy access to information about their products
and services.  Companies use the Web to educate current and
prospective investors by providing copies of annual reports, press
releases and financial data on their corporate home pages.

Other organizations are using the Web to provide fast and
inexpensive access to databases, technical papers, trade journals,
policy directives, program descriptions, and more to network users.


Here is a sampling, from Mr. Schupp's "Guide," of currently
available online energy information resources:

Corporate Home Pages. Utilities like PECO, Illinois Power, ConEd,
Northern States, and others use their new electronic "storefronts"
to attract and educate customers with detailed descriptions of
their products and services.  These storefronts almost always
showcase energy conservation programs, making them a terrific place
to learn about a utility's residential, industrial and commercial
DSM strategies.  Southern California Edison's "HomeLink" Web page
is a good example.

Dozens of manufacturers ranging from GE Power Systems and Honeywell
Industrial Automation and Control to Thermomax USA have also gotten
into the act on the Internet.  Visitors to these companies' home
pages will discover a wealth of product specification and
performance information available online.  Looking for an energy
efficiency consultant?  You can save time assembling a short-list
of candidates by starting your search on the Web, where you'll find
background information on Proctor Engineering Group, EnerAction
Inc., and TGK Consulting, to name just a few.

Professional Organizations. Energy industry professional
organizations typically include membership information, electronic
newsletters, directories, and publications catalogs as well as
announcements of upcoming industry trade shows, conferences and
training seminars on their World Wide Web home pages.  The
Association of Energy Service Professionals, the International
District Energy Assn., the Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration
Institute, and the Combined Heat and Power Assn. are just a few
examples of professional organizations that are using the Internet
in this manner.

The Internet also facilitates interactive discussions among
individual energy industry professionals located around the world.
For example, the misc.industry.utilities.electric USENET newsgroup
serves as an electronic meeting place where participants can
exchange news, information and opinions on a wide range of business
and technical issues of interest to the electric power industry.

Internet mailing lists such as Plant-Engineer-Forum, ENCON-L (an
energy conservation mailing list), and EV (the electric vehicle
discussion group) afford participants the means of keeping up with
the latest technical advances in these and other specialized areas
of interest, as well as giving them a chance to "network."

Research Centers. The Energy & Environmental Research Center at the
University of North Dakota Web site and the home pages of the
University of Florida's Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center and
the Thermal Storage Applications Research Center at University of
Wisconsin, among others, offer visitors access to a wealth of
information pertaining to ongoing research and related activities.
Not-for-profit research organizations such as the Institute of Gas
Technology and EPRI also make a great deal of information available
on the Internet, although access to at least some of the material
on their home pages is often limited to registered members.

Government. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Dept.
of Energy (DOE) each operate large Web sites. The DOE site has
links to dozens of home pages maintained by individual DOE Offices,
agency programs like the Biofuels Information Network, and  the
National Labs. More than a dozen state public utility commissions
now make hearing agendas and minutes, rulings, press releases, and
policy papers available on their Internet home pages.

1995 Is Warmest
Year on Record

According to preliminary data from the Climate Research Unit of the
University of East Anglia, the average surface temperature of the
Earth rose to a record high of 58.72(F in 1995. This development,
along with the recently released Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) reports on global warming, is likely to generate new
interest in "energy efficiency" initiatives.

Jim Woolf, writing in The Salt Lake Tribune, quotes Stephen R.
Connors, director of the Electric Utility Program at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, as saying, "There's a high possibility
that CO2 emissions will be regulated sometime around the year 2000.
We have no idea what those regulations will look like. They may be
negligible and they may be serious, but managers are beginning to
ask how they can prepare for them."

Those preparations will undoubtedly include more energy-efficiency
measures. For example, in IPCC's report, Second Assessment Report,
Summary for Policymakers: Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation
Options, they recommend energy efficiency as one measure to reduce
global CO2 emissions. "Numerous studies indicate that 10-30% energy
efficiency gains above present levels are feasible at little or no
net cost in many parts of the world through technical conservation
measures and improved management practices over the next 2 to 3
decades."

Even greater efficiency gains of 50-60% are technically feasible.
In the transportation sector, the report says greater technical
efficiencies and other measures could cut global annual CO2
emissions from transportation by roughly 40% by 2025. The IPCC says
such higher energy efficiencies are crucial if CO2 emissions are to
be sharply reduced and if the overall costs of new energy systems
are to be kept relatively low.

According to a review of the IPCC report by the Center for Global
Change (1347 Massachusetts Ave. SE, Washington, DC 20003-1540; Tel:
202/547-0850), large CO2 reductions can be achieved at relatively
low costs by implementing appropriate policies, deploying better
technologies and shifting towards a less carbon-intensive mix of
fuels (away from coal and toward natural gas, nuclear or renewable
energy).

The report emphasizes that exploiting the opportunities to limit
emissions at relatively low costs will require "initiatives to
counter lack of information and overcome cultural, institutional,
legal, financial and economic barriers which can hinder diffusion
of technology or behavioral changes." Furthermore, the costs of the
needed technologies could not be reduced and their performance
could not be improved sufficiently without "intensified research
and development by governments and the private-sector."

This call for a greater investment in research, development and
demonstration of energy efficiency and renewable energy
technologies comes at a time when the Congress is planning major
funding cuts, and private sector investment is unlikely to fill the
breach. At a Washington, DC, press conference where the IPCC report
was released, Working Group II chairman Robert Watson said that the
Congress was "moving in the wrong direction" with its budget
proposals. Watson, who also is associate director for the
environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy, said that at the Congressionally proposed spending levels
it would be "difficult if not impossible" to achieve large US
emissions reductions at the rates and relatively low costs
suggested by the IPCC report.

Analyzing Repeal
of Speed Limit

The recent repeal of the federal speed limit is projected to
significantly increase average speed on the nation's highways and,
therefore, motor vehicle fuel consumption. According to Mark Fulmer
of the Tellus Institute (11 Arlington St., Boston, MA 02116-3411;
Tel: 617/266-5400; email: mfulmer@tellus.com), at highway speeds,
aerodynamic drag is the dominant loss factor.

Since drag increases with the square of the velocity, even a 5 mph
increase in speed leads to significant increases in fuel
consumption. For example, increasing speed from 60 to 70 mph--what
one might expect with the less stringent speed limits--increases in
fuel use by about 15%. Increasing speed from the 1973 level of 55
mph to 70 mph may increase fuel use by as much as 25%." Fulmer also
noted that, "these highway speed increases will significantly
increase carbon dioxide emissions."

According to Fulmer, "Considering that over 400 billion vehicle
miles are traveled each year on rural interstates and other major
rural highways, the energy impacts become very substantial.
Increasing average speeds on these rural freeways by 10 mph (60-70
mpg) increases highway energy use by over 100 million barrels of
oil a year, an increase of 4.5% in our oil imports.  This is enough
gasoline to run over 7 million average American cars for one year
(500 gallons per car per year)."

Tellus used data from primary sources including Highway Statistics
(Federal Highway Administration) and the Transportation Energy Data
Book:  Edition 15 (Oak Ridge National Lab) in their analysis.

Free Marketing for
Efficient Equipment

Producers of energy-efficient equipment may benefit from
registering with the Environmental Technology Network for Asia
(ETNA). This free, government-sponsored service helps link
businesses with export opportunities in Asia.

Here's how it works: US-AEP representatives based in ten Asian
cities - Bangkok, Bombay, Colombo, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala
Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei - gather leads about
specific opportunities for environmental technologies both for
pollution prevention and amelioration, and energy efficiency. ETNA
electronically matches these leads to appropriate U.S.
environmental companies registered within its database.

Companies whose services match a requirement in Asia are alerted by
fax - within 48 hrs. of the entry of the lead - to facilitate a
quick response. ETNA recently expanded its coverage to Latin
America. Through an agreement with the U.N., ETNA now collects  and
disseminates trade leads from eleven Latin American countries:
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

To register with ETNA, point your Web browser to:
http://www.conet.com/etna/. The online registration form is split
into several pages. The first page asks for all the necessary
contact information so that the trade leads are correctly sent. The
next few pages cover the 484 technology codes split into two media-
specific sections (Pollution Control, Treatment and Disposal, and
Clean Technologies) and one non-media specific section
(Environmental Management). You are allowed to register for a
maximum of 18 technology codes.

For more information, contact the ETNA office at: US-AEP ETNA, CTIS

Panel Urges More
Vehicle Efficiency

A little over a year ago, President Clinton assembled a
presidential advisory committee and charged them with the task of
developing policies to cost-effectively return greenhouse gas
emissions from cars and light trucks to their 1990 level by the
year 2005. Committee members included state and local government
officials, corporate executives, and public interest group
representatives.

The committee's report (Majority Report to the President by the
Policy Dialogue Advisory Committee to Recommend Options for
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Personal Motor Vehicles),
has just been released. It recommends policies that would meet the
president's goal in 2005 and overachieve in 2015 and 2025.

The package for returning U.S. car and light truck CO2 emissions to
their 1990 level includes policies in three areas:

    fuel economy (including feebates for low rolling resistance
tires and mandatory efficiency standards);
    reduction of vehicle miles traveled through increased taxes;
    and use of alternative fuels.

The most important policy for reducing emissions to the 1990 level
is a 6% annual increase in fuel economy standards over 10 years,
starting in 1998. Other key recommended policies include an
equitable shift of state and local road subsidies to cost-of-
driving fees, land use changes away from auto dependency, workplace
parking subsidy reform, and incentives for liquid biofuels and
electric and natural gas vehicles.

The near-term outlook for improvements in transportation sector
efficiency has dimmed due to the repeal of the Federal speed limit.
Congress has also included in the Dept. of Transportation
Appropriations for 1996 a "rider" authored by Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX)
prohibiting the DOT from engaging in a rulemaking to increase fuel
economy standards.

That provision freezes for a year the DOT's already-underway
process to raise gas mileage standards for light trucks, as well as
prevents any increase in car standards that the Administration
might consider. Finally, Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) has introduced a
bill, H.R.2200, that would take away the executive branch's
authority to raise car gas mileage standards administratively; that
bill currently has over 100 cosponsors.

University to Slash
Energy Consumption

A performance contracting project spearheaded by the State of
Hawaii Dept. of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism's
Energy Div. will allow the University of Hawaii at Hilo to cut its
annual energy bill by $500,000 and trim its annual energy
consumption by 1.4 million kWh, saving taxpayers approximately $5
million over the next ten years.

Johnson Controls (5757 N. Green Bay Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53209-4408;
Tel: 414/228-1200) was selected through an open competition which
sought qualified proposals. Under this contract, Johnson Controls
will finance, design, install, and maintain a turnkey energy-
efficiency project that includes campus-wide lighting retrofits,
air conditioning modifications, an energy management system, and
cogeneration for the main campus.

The future savings from the retrofit will be used to pay for the
project. The project allows businesses and government agencies to
implement various energy-saving measures with no up-front capital
costs. Energy devices and technologies can be installed at a time
convenient to the facility with little disruption to day-to-day
operations. The contractor bears the risk for equipment performance
and there is a strong incentive for ongoing preventive maintenance.

Portland Saves
When Wind Blows

A creative power purchase contract between the City of Portland and
Portland General Electric (PGE, 121 S.W. Salmon St., Portland, OR
97204-2977; Tel: 503/464-8000) will save the city about $175,000 in
the first year and as much as $850,000 over the next five years.
PGE has agreed to purchase or generate approximately 11 million kWh
of wind generated electricity during the term of the five-year
agreement. Enough wind power is generated to run City Hall ,
Multnomah Arts Center and ten fire stations.

This innovative arrangement, which is the first of its kind in the
nation, was suggested to the city by PGE as a way to accomplish two
city energy goals: reduce city government energy bills and promote
renewable energy resources. Under a new experimental pricing
schedule, annual power purchases of about $2 million will be tied
to the wholesale cost of electricity. The savings will appear on
the bills of industrial-type facilities such as wastewater
treatment plants at Columbia Boulevard and Tryon Creek, water pump
stations at Washington Park, and the city's flagship office
facility, the Portland Building.

PGE also agreed that it will purchase or generate wind power in an
amount equal to 5% of the energy purchased under the new tariff.
The city's renewable wind purchase will be over 2 million kWh of
electricity each year, an amount equal the output of about 2.5 wind
turbines.

Why Russian Buildings
Use More Energy

According to work performed by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel:
617/253-1000) researchers, on a climate-adjusted basis, the
Russians use about twice as much energy to heat their buildings as
the Swedish, and a third more than Americans.  To find out why, MIT
faculty, led by professor Leslie Norford, have worked with Russian
energy experts for six years to better quantify energy use in
Russian residential buildings and pinpoint the sources of wasted
energy.

They compared annual heating-energy consumption as predicted from
building-construction data and as measured. Data were collected for
both a single, carefully studied multifamily building in Moscow
and, with less detail, for the aggregate housing stock in Moscow.

In both cases, it was found that buildings are using about 60% more
energy than would be expected from engineering estimates. For the
multifamily building, the source of about two-thirds of the wasted
energy was overheating in spring and fall, caused by inadequate
control of the district-heating system.

The next phase of the work is to collaborate with the Russians to
draft new-building energy codes that will establish requirements
for building design and operation, based on technological potential
for conservation and the institutional mechanisms needed to achieve
savings. This work is being funded by the NSF, the Toda Corp., and
the EPA.

Honeywell Upgrades
District Heating

Honeywell (Honeywell Plaza, Minneapolis, MN 55408; Tel: 612/951-
1000) announced in December that it has received its first district
heating contract in China, a project that builds on Honeywell's
extensive district heating work in Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States. (To-date, Honeywell has contracts with 136
heating districts in 15 countries in Europe, Eastern Europe and the
CIS; that's up 36% from the number of contracts two years ago.)

The contract, valued at $2.4 million and extending over two years,
is with the Beijing District Heating Co., a state-owned supplier of
heat that serves more than 20% of all residences and commercial
buildings in the city of Beijing. Under the agreement, Honeywell
will provide monitoring and control systems to help the district
improve productivity, save energy, reduce air pollution and provide
better temperature control for its residents.

The agreement, which comes after three years of discussions, opens
a new Asia-Pacific market segment with vast potential as cities
seek to improve their infrastructures with more modern controls.
The World Bank is funding the project as one means to help improve
the living environment and conserve energy around the world.

While most urban residents in China get their heat from coal-
burning furnaces in individual homes and apartments, the trend in
cities is to convert to centrally operated district heating, which
distributes heat to homes and buildings via a network of pipes. In
fact, the government has mandated that buildings be district heated
in cities in which the average daily temperature falls below 41(F
for more than 90 days a year. Nearly 100 million Chinese live in
cities with these temperature conditions. Many of these cities face
the need to build new or upgrade existing plants to comply with the
mandate and to reduce pollution and lower energy costs.

While district heating may represent an improvement over the
inefficiencies and environmental impact of millions of small coal-
burning furnaces, it, too, is wasteful without proper controls. And
many district systems do lack controls--at the point of generation,
distribution or heat consumption--resulting in overheating in some
areas and insufficient heating in others. Unoccupied buildings may
be heated needlessly at night. District heating customers may
have no controls with which to regulate heat in their homes,
apartments, factories or offices.

Under the contract, Honeywell will install a SCAN 3000 system to
provide supervisory control and data acquisition at the heating
district's central operations. This microprocessor-based system
will provide single-point, central monitoring and supervision of
the overall heating network, including substations. Additional
Honeywell products will be installed to create an integrated system
that permits operators to automatically manage and monitor heat
production. The Honeywell system also will enable heating company
managers to forecast heat demand accurately and take appropriate
actions to improve burner efficiency and energy management and to
reduce operational costs.

Honeywell expects to begin installing the systems in early 1996,
with completion slated for October 1997. The resulting energy
savings could be significant. District heating systems in Eastern
Europe and the CIS, some of which consume 2.5 times or more energy
than comparable systems in Western Europe, have typically realized
savings from 20-30% when Honeywell controls were installed. Because
European heating districts typically burn coal, improving the
efficiency of such systems reduces pollution as well.

NedWind to Sell 110
Wind Machines

According to Tom Gray of the American Wind Energy Assn. (122 C St.
NW, Fourth Floor, Washington, DC 20001; Tel: 202/383-2500), Dutch
wind turbine manufacturer NedWind Rhenen BV has signed contracts to
supply more than 110 machines for use in power projects in China
and India.

The company has established a joint venture with Weizmann, Ltd., in
India called Windia Power Limited which will build a 33-MW windfarm
in the southern part of India near Kayathar, in the state of Tamil

Onsite Announces $5
Million Contract

Onsite Energy Corp. (701 Palomar Airport Rd., Suite 200, Carlsbad,
CA 92009; Tel: 619/931-2400) announced that it has received
purchase orders from a major aerospace manufacturing company in the
Southern California Edison (SCE, 2244 Walnut Grove Ave., Rosemead,
CA 91770; Tel: 818/302-1212) service territory to provide energy-
efficiency equipment and services including audits, lighting
equipment installation, (ballasts, reflectors and lamps) and
construction/project management.

Onsite will also provide post-installation measurement and
verification and operation and maintenance services over a three-
year period following the anticipated completion of the project in
mid-1996.  Gross revenues to Onsite under this contract will be
approximately $5 million.

The project for the manufacturing company will incorporate a
substantial payment to Onsite from SCE over the three years
following completion of the project, pursuant to the DSM Agreements
between Onsite and SCE.  The project for the manufacturing company
is expected to provide up to 30 million kWh in energy savings
during the first year of operation.  Payments from SCE are based on
actual project performance and delivery of actual energy savings.

According to Richard T. Sperberg, president of Onsite, "The
contract with this major manufacturing company will make a
significant contribution toward fulfilling our commitment to SCE
pursuant to the SCE Agreements."  The SCE Agreements are a result
of competitive bids submitted in 1993 and subsequent approval by
the California Public Utility Commission for Onsite to provide up
to approximately 60 million kWh in energy savings through
installation of energy-efficiency services projects in host
customer facilities within SCE's service territory.

Sensors Used in
BOF Steelmaking

Sensor technologies originally developed to monitor coal combustion
and welding in the laboratory are being applied to improve the
efficiency of steelmaking. The technology employs a laser-based
sensor that can track the conversion of iron and carbon into steel.


Underway since 1993, this is part of a four-year project managed by
the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI, 1101 17th St. NW,
Washington, DC 20036-4700; Tel: 202/452-7100) under the
Congressionally-mandated Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and
Technology Competitiveness Act of 1988, the so-called "Metals
Initiative."

Fifteen AISI members fund 30% of the $3.5 million project. The
remainder is funded by the Dept. of Energy's (DOE) Office of
Industrial Technology. Bethlehem Steel Corp. (1170 8th Ave.,
Bethlehem, PA 18016-7600; Tel: 215/694-2424) is the sponsoring
steel company and hosts plant trials. Insitec Measurement Systems
(2110 Omega Rd., Suite D, San Ramon, CA 94583; Tel: 510/837-1330)
and Berry Metal Co. (2408 Evans City Rd., Berry Bldg., Harmony, PA
16037-9110; Tel: 412/452-8040) are the other partners, responsible
for commercialization of the Sandia-developed sensors.

The research focuses on improving the energy and process efficiency
of the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which is used to make 60% of the
country's steel. Upstream of the BOF, iron is produced by reducing
iron ore with limestone and coke in a blast furnace. The molten
iron is converted to steel in the BOF by burning off carbon.

By implementing fast, real-time sensors in the BOF process, both
the time for each 'heat' and oxygen consumption can be reduced
while improving the efficiency and reliability of the process from
heat to heat. The Sandia team is testing several infrared laser
methods to measure the temperature, water content, ratio of carbon
dioxide to carbon monoxide, and the presence of particles above the
melt. The carbon dioxide-to-carbon monoxide ratio is useful in
determining how much carbon remains; this content is normally
analyzed before final metallurgy adjustments.

Beth Fuchs and three other Sandians have worked with Insitec, Berry
Metal Co. (the principal manufacturer of oxygen lances for the
steel industry), and Bethlehem Steel to design and package the
sensor. Timken Steel's (1835 Dueber Ave. SW, Canton, OH 44706-2728;
Tel: 216/438-3000) Faircrest Plant hosted field trials. The sensor
package has two miniature video cameras, filters for controlling
both the wavelength and the intensity of the light reaching the
cameras, laser diodes, coherent fiber optics for guiding images,
single fiber optics for guiding laser light, and circuitry for
controlling the filters. These components are inserted into a
compact package near the tip of the lance.

The sensors monitor temperature at the combustion zone, the bath
surface where a blast of oxygen pushes aside thick, foamy slag. The
first direct images of this "hot spot" were taken during field
trials in May. Temperature at this spot can indicate final carbon
content. At the end of an oxygen blow, the device also detects
radiance from the bath, indicating melt temperature. The lance
instrument package also collects real-time information on the bath
height. After the melt is poured, the instruments may also reveal
any wear and tear or slag build-up on the ceramic lining.

The steel industry's vision for the mill of the future is to move
from steelmaking to near-net-shape casting to finishing in one
fast, continuous process. To do this requires development,
validation and commercialization of fast sensor systems throughout
the process. Success of the Sandia project will lead to the
availability of validated prototype sensors that can then be
quickly commercialized and implemented throughout the U.S. steel
industry.

Kaiser Saves with
Fuel from Tires

Commencing November 29, 1995, Kaiser Cement (3000 Busch Rd.,
Pleasanton, CA 94566-8403; Tel: 510/846-8800) began a 90-day test
of a tire-derived fuel which has saved energy and reduced pollution
emissions at cement plants around the country. The test is being
overseen by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
at the cement plant near Cupertino, CA.  Kaiser Cement embarked on
the test after studying successful results using tire-derived fuel
at 4 other California cement plants and 23 across the nation.

"Using tire chips for fuel appears to be a win-win situation,"
explained Earl Bouse, VP of manufacturing services. "If our test
confirms the results seen elsewhere, we will show air-quality
improvements and be able to save energy."

During the test, the tire chips would replace up to 15% of the
current fuel, primarily coal, used in the cement plant's kiln. No
black smoke or odors associated with open-air tire fires occur when
tire chips are used at cement plants because the enclosed kiln
operates at such intense heat (2,800( F) that the fuel is totally
consumed.

A major attraction of using tire chips is energy savings. Though
Kaiser Cement has energy-efficient plants, fuel is still their
single largest operating expense. According to Bouse, "as tire
chips contain more heat value than coal, the cost to us--including
transportation--is much less." In other locations, tire-derived
fuel has been shown to successfully reduce emissions from cement
kilns. Kaiser Cement already has achieved a low level of NOx
emission for cement production.

While additional reductions are expected by using tire chip fuel,
the extent must be confirmed through the test. The test also will
establish if any other contaminants are affected by using TDF.
Kaiser Cement currently is below the risk level that requires
public notification under the California air toxics program
administered by the BAAQMD. The company will not use TDF if the
test shows an increase in health effects.

Regulators, including the federal EPA, California Integrated Waste
Management Board and other agencies consider burning TDF in cement
plants to be an ideal solution to tire disposal problems. In
addition to air improvements, there is no waste product as the
cement process consumes all parts of the tire--even the steel belts
become part of the product.

CFC Substitute Forane
408A Superior to R-502

According to Elf Atochem (2000 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19103-
3231; Tel: 215/419-7027), the findings of a recent refrigerant
performance test show that their CFC substitute Forane 408A is
superior to R-502 in energy-efficiency for medium and low
temperature refrigeration systems. In a laboratory test performed
by VACOM Technologies and ASW Engineering for Energy Services Inc.,
Forane 408A was found to be, on average, 5-8% more energy-efficient
than R-502 in a simulated supermarket environment containing a
typical freezer display case fixture.

Forane 408A is intended as a drop-in replacement for retrofitting
existing equipment currently using R-502, such as food display and
storage cases, cold storage rooms, ice machines, transportation and
process refrigeration.  It has been available for the past 18
months and has found a broad market acceptance in its retrofit
applications. One of the largest expenses for the supermarket
industry is cost of electricity to run the refrigeration systems.

According to an Atochem spokesperson, "the results of these tests
are  very positive news for the supermarket industry, as well as
any industry that utilizes R-502 in medium to low temperature
refrigeration systems.  By retrofitting their equipment now with
Forane 408A, they will potentially realize a cost savings through
energy efficiencies, while becoming CFC-free at the same time."

Japanese Condos
Cut Energy Bills

According to wire reports from the Kyodo News Service, condominiums
equipped with energy efficiency and rainwater collection systems
are selling well in Japan. Housing complexes utilizing clean energy
sources are currently on sale at three locations across the nation,
two in the Tokyo area and another in Kitakyushu on Japan's main
southern island of Kyushu. In all cases, each building has solar
equipment on its roof to help residents save on gas and electricity
bills and is equipped with an underground tank to store rainwater
to supply water to greenery and vegetable gardens.

These condominiums have been contracted for sale even though they
are more expensive due to higher construction costs. Construction
Ministry officials said construction of ''environmentally
friendly'' condominiums is now under way or planned at 86 places
across the nation. The officials said the ministry offers subsidies
for construction of such energy-efficient housing while the
governmental Housing Loan Corp. provides preferential loans for
builders.

U.S., Canada Report
Data from 1993

The Energy Dept. recently released the results of its 1993
Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS).  That's right--1993.
But some of the data is interesting.

It is the ninth such survey performed since 1978. According to data
presented in volume II (Household Energy Consumption and
Expenditures, 1993), new homes (built between 1988 and 1993 were
intentionally oversampled to learn more about their energy
efficiency) use, on average, only 82% of the energy used by homes
built before 1980. Most of this gain comes from improvements in
space heating equipment and thermal integrity.

According to the survey, more than half of the electricity used in
homes operates appliances - lighting, TV, clothes dryers, freezers,
ranges, ovens, and others. For the first time, the RECS survey
provides separate estimates for the average annual per household
kWh consumption for lighting (940 kWh), cooking (458 kWh), clothes
drying (875 kWh), and dishwashing (299 kWh).

The report notes that, despite efficiency gains (particularly for
refrigerators), the consumption of electricity for appliances is
increasing, likely as the result of absolute growth in the numbers
of appliances. For example, in 1980 only 14% of households used
microwave ovens, but in 1993 84% of households used one. Personal
computers have also become more common; in 1990, 16% of households
had personal computers, a percentage that grew to 23% in 1993.

To obtain a copy of the RECS survey report, contact the National
Energy Information Center, Tel: 202/586-8800.

Meanwhile, in Canada, NRCan is also playing catch up. It released
the 1993 Survey of Household Energy Use, which is the first
comprehensive national survey of energy use in Canadian housing.
The report provides extensive data on thermal envelopes, heating
and hot water systems, appliances, lighting, and air conditioning
by house type and age. The survey was undertaken as part of the
development of a National Energy Use Database, which NRCan hopes to
update every four years.

Survey results highlight some potential retrofit opportunities.
Perhaps most striking is that in this current age of "super
windows," one third of all windows are either single-glazed or
single-glazed with a storm. Also, in spite of the many conservation
programs in the past, the majority of homes have not had their
insulation upgraded.

A large number of heating systems and appliances are old and will
need replacement soon. Air-leakage problems at windows and doors
are reported by one-third and one-half of households, respectively.
Window airtightness has not been improved in 59% of homes and door
airtightness has not been improved in 48%. Thirty-two percent of
windows are single-glazed (with or without a storm); 64% of homes
have not had any windows replaced.

Thirty-two percent of basement walls remain uninsulated; 62% of
households have not upgraded their attic insulation. Furnaces and
boilers are more than 15 years old in 60% of oil-heated homes and
33% of gas-heated homes. With regard to appliances, 44% of ranges,
38% of dryers, 37% of refrigerators, 32% of clothes washers and 25%
of dishwashers are more than 10 years old. In the area of lighting,
incandescent bulbs still outnumber fluorescent ones by 10:1.

The survey did find, though, that some energy-efficient
technologies have succeeded in substantially penetrating the
market. Ten percent of Canadian homes are reported to have air
exchangers, and more than half of these are used all year-round.

Water-saving showerheads are found in 40% of homes with hot water
heaters. Programmable thermostats are found in 18%. Surprisingly,
almost 10% reported having basement floors which are fully or
partially insulated.

From the perspective of possible moisture problems, some
questionable practices and deficiencies were also uncovered. More
than a third of households do not heat all or part of their
basement, and more than half do not have any bathroom exhaust fans.

Geothermal Well
Comes in Hot

Pacific GeoPower, the joint venture formed between Canadian Crew
Energy Corp. and Guy F. Atkinson Holdings Ltd. to develop the South
Meager Geothermal Project, has now completed the drilling and
initial testing of a deep well into the geothermal resource north
of Pemberton, B.C. Well temperatures exceeded 250(C, and geo-
chemical analyses of the fluids sampled support the existence of a
deep, higher temperature reservoir, in addition to the known
shallower reservoir.

While this particular well did not penetrate a fluid conduit that
would provide commercial production, additional drilling will be
required to locate permeability within the resource to fully
determine the capability of the reservoir. Interpretation of the
resource data provided from the drilling program has encouraged the
joint venture partners to proceed with further exploration of the
South Meager geothermal resource.

Ford's Concept Car
Pushes Limits

A new Ford (American Rd., Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel: 313/322-3000)
hybrid electric vehicle concept car, Synergy 2010, built on an all-
aluminum unibody and incorporating highly advanced technologies
could theoretically triple the fuel efficiency of a typical family
sedan. Ford unveiled the car at the company's year-end news
conference and it will be on display at the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit from Jan. 6-15.

According to the company, a key purpose of this concept car is to
explore how highly fuel efficient technologies could be packaged in
a well styled car of the future. Loaded with advanced technology
features such as voice-activated controls, an advanced navigation
system, heads-up displays and solar-powered cooling, the car is
one-third lighter and 40% more aerodynamic than today's sleekest
Ford, yet still roomy enough for a family of six.

In the Synergy 2010, a small, 1.0-liter direct-injection,
compression-ignited engine mounted in the rear would power a
generator that produces electricity for motors located in each
wheel.  Up front, a flywheel would collect excess engine and
braking energy, which in turn would be released to augment the
engine when, for example, the car needed to accelerate quickly or
climb hills.

In a direct-injection, compression-ignited engine, high pressure or
heat is used instead of spark plugs to ignite the fuel, resulting
in higher efficiency.  Theoretically, the Synergy 2010's
performance with this smaller engine would be comparable to today's
typical mid-sized family sedan because of its decreased weight,
improved aerodynamics and lower rolling resistance.

California May
Scuttle EV Quotas

Several important EV developments were announced during December.
First, the California Air Resources Board staff presented a
proposal to scuttle the 1998 2% Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV)
requirement. The year 2003 requirement for 10% would stand. This
proposal, presented in outline form and subject to revision until
March of 1996, calls for a demonstration project in Sacramento and
Los Angeles. This would require only 3,750 ZEVs available between
1998 and 2000 versus 60,000 under the original proposal.

In another EV development, Green Car Media, an independent
alternative fuel research organization, released a study which
concludes that if automakers treated electric vehicles the same way
they do their conventional cars and trucks, then electric vehicles
could be priced competitively with their gasoline-powered
counterparts. "Current EV cost and price estimates from the major
automakers are arbitrarily high," said Ron Cogan, one of the
report's authors.  He added that EVs could be treated like other
industry programs, for example, Chrysler's Viper, where substantial
development costs were both absorbed under corporate programs and
shared with outside suppliers.

The study, Pricing For Success: Using Auto Industry Models to
Review Electric Vehicle Costing and Pricing, reviewed historic
vehicle costing and pricing practices long used by the auto
industry both for vehicles and individual components such as
airbags, catalytic converters and emissions control equipment.

The study found that market and marketing considerations have led
auto companies in the past to absorb high vehicle research and
development costs, while keeping vehicle retail prices competitive.
Examples cited were the development of General Motors' Saturn,
Chrysler's Viper, and Ford's just-introduced 1996 Taurus/Sable. In
each case, the true development costs were not amortized in the
vehicle's initial price.  Other less tangible considerations, such
as corporate image and positioning, also were shown to be a factor
in the automakers' pricing decisions.

Finally, according to a survey of participants at the World
Electric Vehicle Assn.'s November conference, 62% of those
responding to the survey believe that Europe is ahead of the U.S.
in promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs), but 48% percent
expect the U.S. to catch up. Forty-two percent of the respondents
also said the U.S. market has the most growth potential. In
addition, 78% indicated that fleets were the best way to bring EVs
into widespread usage. Respondents said EV development in Europe is
a result of higher gasoline costs and the urgency of pollution in
European cities.

Forecasting Cuts
Costs by 5%

A method of load forecasting based on a recursive maximum
likelihood estimation adaptive forecasting technique has
demonstrated savings of 5% in production costs for electric
generating and district heating plants in Europe.  Already proved
in use at plants throughout Scandinavia, the "Power Load
Forecasting Service," sold by Vitec AB (Box 1465, S-90124, Umea,
Sweden; Tel: 46(0)90-15-49-00) has been shown to provide plant
operators with significant cost savings through increased operating
efficiency.

For example, while in use at the combined electricity generation
and district heating plant at Umea in northern Sweden over the last
three years, the Vitec service reduced the plant's production costs
by no less than 5%, providing a financial savings of $500,000 to
$700,000 per year. By achieving these cost savings at Umea and
elsewhere, the service has been frequently proved to repay its
annual subscription costs in just its first day of operation - even
in its first hour.

Once installed at a plant, the Vitec system is accessed via an IBM-
compatible PC which is connected to the plant's existing process
control computers via a serial link or LAN. It also connects via
modem to Vitec's control center, for example, allowing the center
to upload process data and download forecasting data for the
specific plant location.

Because it is adaptive, the forecasting technique constantly
adjusts its current forecasts to take into account the accuracy
achieved by previous forecasts. This self-correcting capability is
reinforced by constant quality assurance, with the Vitec control
center verifying accurate operation daily and taking additional
corrective measures if the forecast load differs from the actual
load by more than 2% in any 24-hour period.

Inverter Improves
Motor Efficiency

Electric vehicles, adjustable-speed motors, heat pumps, fans and
compressors may benefit from a new electric power inverter
developed by researchers at the Dept. of Energy's (DOE) Oak Ridge
National Lab (ORNL). The Resonant Snubber Inverter (RSI), invented
by engineers in the Digital and Power Electronics Group, improves
efficiency and reliability, is smaller, lighter, greatly reduces
electromagnetic interference (EMI) and potentially lowers the cost
of electric power inverters. Inverters, used with many electric
devices and motors, convert available power to the type needed--
such as direct current to alternating current.

The RSI is about 80%t efficient at low speeds and 98% efficient at
high speeds. Conventional inverters are about 60-70% efficient at
low speeds and 94%t efficient at high speeds. Inverter efficiency
gains of that magnitude--especially at the lower speeds typical of
its use in a car--could help electric vehicles become a viable
option, researchers say.

To perform their function, inverters employ a series of switches
and electronic components. A conventional electric power inverter
consists of six power semiconductor switches that turn on or off
about 20,000 times per second in different combinations to provide
the desired output.

The inverter switch turns on and off at full voltage and current,
generating a huge, wasteful power spike. This type of "hard
switching" is an effective way of obtaining a specific current;
however, this circuit design causes many problems. In addition to
EMI caused by hard switching, conventional inverters put
considerable stress on silicon devices and other parts within the
inverter, causing reliability problems.

While the conventional inverter uses six switches to achieve a
desired output, the RSI adds three small auxiliary switches that
temporarily--and very briefly--divert current, then route it back
to one of the six main switches. This diversion, which lasts only
a couple of microseconds, produces a zero voltage across the switch
and helps reduce damaging power spikes. It also enables the RSI's
soft switching to increase efficiency from 4-15 percentage points
compared to a conventional inverter.

The efficiency gain is dependent on the speed of the motor
connected to the inverter. Greatest efficiency gains occur when the
motor is run at less than full speed, typical of an inverter's
function in an electric vehicle. While gains in efficiency are
important, ORNL also claims that the RSI virtually eliminates EMI.

Tests using an oscilloscope show EMI is greatly reduced compared to
conventional hard switching inverters and previously developed soft
switching inverters. EMI can interfere with functions of
appliances, telephones, electronic instruments, television
reception and other electronic equipment, such as computer
controlled ignition in automobiles.

Another benefit of the RSI is that it reduces voltage and current
stress to inverter components. This improves the reliability and
allows lower-cost power devices to be used. Because the RSI
smoothly changes the voltage and current during device switching,
it can also help reduce the possibility of motor failure caused by
insulation breakdown and bearing overheating. Soft switching also
reduces the inverter's operating temperature, reducing the need for
large, heavy heat sinks, which are devices to dissipate heat.
Instead, the RSI can use smaller, lighter, less expensive heat
sinks. Excessive heat degrades electronic equipment and causes
failures.

In a related project, the RSI is being incorporated into an
advanced air conditioner to be installed on electric buses,
including one in Chattanooga in 1997. The unit is the product of
ORNL's work in advanced electric motor technology and a cooperative
research and development agreement partner's new air conditioner
technology. Installation of the unit is expected to eliminate the
need for an auxiliary power unit required for the bus's air
conditioner. These auxiliary units are currently powered by
propane, which results in emissions, noise, added weight and cost.

Desulfurization Process
Could Boost Oil Supply

Energy BioSystems Corp. (4200 Research Forest Dr., The Woodlands,
TX 77381-4257; Tel: 713/364-6132) is commercializing biotechnology-
based processes for the petroleum refining and production
industries.  The company's focus to-date has been on developing
biocatalytic desulfurization (BDS), a proprietary process involving
the use of bacteria to remove sulfur from petroleum.

This process is expected to help refiners worldwide meet
environmental regulations in a more cost-effective manner and has
the potential to greatly improve the value of high-sulfur crude oil
reserves. In December, the company announced a major advance in the
performance of the biocatalyst which drives the BDS system.

Application of recent discoveries has led to a six- to eightfold
increase in the specific activity of intermediate reactions
critical to BDS economics.  "In the last few months we have applied
the discoveries reported in September," said Dr. Daniel J.
Monticello, VP of R&D at Energy BioSystems. "The resulting
improvement exceeds our expectation of a three- to fivefold
increase.  We are now significantly closer to the performance level
needed for commercialization of BDS, but additional development is
required on a final reaction to produce the prototype biocatalyst
necessary for pilot plant demonstration runs," he continued.

Further improvements are expected in early 1996 which should lead
to the biocatalyst performance required for commercial
demonstration of BDS technology.

In December, Energy BioSystems also announced that the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office has issued two new process patents to the
company. The first patent (U.S. 5,472,875) claims a new reactor
design involving the introduction of air or oxygen-enriched gas
into the oil prior to treatment with the biocatalyst.  The second
patent (U.S. 5,468,626) claims a method by which a biosorption
agent preferentially adsorbs sulfur-containing compounds from
petroleum.  Such a process design could reduce the size of the
bioreactor by concentrating on those compounds requiring
desulfurization, thus reducing capital equipment costs.

More Orders for
New Compressor

DynEco Corp. (564 International Pl., Rockledge, FL 32955; Tel:
407/639-0333) has received a new order for eight demonstration
Orbital Vane mobile air conditioning compressors from Trans/Air
Manufacturing Corp. (P.O. Box 70, Dallastown, PA 17313; Tel:
717/246-2627).  Trans/Air is a leading supplier of custom-designed
air conditioning systems for fossil-fueled and electric-powered
commercial and mass-transit vehicles. This is the second order that
DynEco has received recently from leaders in the private and
commercial vehicle A/C markets.

The patented Orbital Vane compressor represents an engineering
breakthrough due to its unique anti-friction (non-contact) design.
In an independent test report prepared by the Dept. of Energy
(DOE), it was reported that, "this new compressor is compact,
lightweight, and more efficient than conventional automobile air
conditioning compressors."  It operates with a wide range of gases,
including ozone-safe refrigerant HFC-134a.  DynEco Corp. expects
its array of innovative compressors to be highly price-competitive
due to their simplicity and ease of manufacture.

Previously, 30 demonstration compressors were ordered by
SCS/Frigette (1200 West Risinger Rd., Fort Worth, TX 76134; Tel:
817/293-5313). SCS/Frigette is a producer of aftermarket and
replacement automotive air conditioning systems and other
automotive accessories.

Trans/Air will conduct extensive testing of DynEco's Orbital Vane
compressors in anticipation of integrating them into their high-
efficiency mass transit air conditioning systems.  The company
believes that this purchase could lead to a significant market for
hundreds of compressors, which would further accelerate growth of
the Rockledge, FL-based company.

Big Investment in
Halogen Bulb Plant

In December, GE Lighting (3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, CT
06432-1041; Tel: 203/373-2211) announced that it will invest more
than $100 million over four years in new production lines to expand
capacity at a GE plant in Mattoon, IL. A major part of the
investment will be used to expand manufacturing capacity for GE's
exclusive Halogen-IR light bulbs--which are the most energy-
efficient halogen light bulbs available in the world.

This GE high-technology involves a special infrared coating and
unique application process applied to the inner filament tube which
captures wasted infrared energy and turns it into more visible,
useful light.  In addition to providing significant energy savings,
Halogen-IR--a global product--produces crisp white light and
excellent color rendering.

The inner tubes will be manufactured and coated at Mattoon Lamp
Plant, then shipped to other GE plants for final assembly.  Typical
applications are retail display lighting and residential and
commercial floodlighting.  Other types of high efficiency halogen
light bulb production will also be added at the plant.

German Windpower
Report Available

According to Paul Gipe (Paul Gipe & Assoc., 208 S. Green St., No.
5; Tehachapi, CA 93561; Tel: 805/822-9150), one of Germany's major
solar energy research institutes recently issued a detailed report
on German wind development. According to Mr. Gipe, "this report is
one of the most detailed documents yet on the makeup of the German
wind program. Germany is in a frenzy of wind development not seen
since the great California 'wind rush' of the mid 1980s."

By the end of 1995, Germany will have installed a total of 1,000 MW
of wind-generating capacity." At the current rate, Germany's
installed capacity will exceed that in California sometime in mid-
1997 and will exceed that in all of North America by the end of
1997. Wind turbines currently generate 4% of the electricity in the
northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein and are expected to
deliver nearly 10% by the year 2000.

Two organizations follow German wind development, the German Wind
Energy Institut (Deutsches Windenergie Institut) at Wilhelmshaven
and the Institut fur Solare Energieversorgungstehnik or ISET in
Kassel. Both are excellent sources of information on the technical
side of wind development in Germany. ISET is specifically charged
with tracking the performance of Germany's "250 MW" incentive
program. Under the 250 MW program, Germany pays 6 pfennigs
($0.035)/kWh of generation from selected wind turbines. Between
1989 and 1991 this program spurred development of the Germany wind
industry. In 1991, Germany implemented the Electricity Feed Law
that has further spurred rapid development of wind energy in the
country.

The report, "WMEP 250 MW Wind Jahresauswertung 1994" (1994 Annual
Report of the 250 MW Wind Program) is in German with English
summaries.

The report can be purchased from ISET for DM 30 (about $20) plus
shipping and handling. Contact: ISET, Koenigstor 59 D34119 Kassel,
