The weakest is the Dow Jones World Average which over the past month, has sunk into the bottom quartile of my domestic and international indices' list. The EAFE has done somewhat better but is still in the bottom third of the rankings. I'd not buy broadly-based international funds for the time being and would wait for a new rally phase. As for liquidating investment positions, the daily charts of several prominent Canadian international funds seem to be in sound condition. Top performer Trimark Fund is a little weaker than the others, but it's still a little too soon to start panicking. I'd rather give the markets the benefit of the doubt by looking for a rally, rather than try a quick out/in trade.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/e.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>UROPE. I think that I've had the European sector on my buy list almost every month for nearly two years. The past month ended up being the worst performance to date, with the Morgan Stanley Europe Index falling about 3%. Again, I'd stick with the investment for the time being, at least. Having checked the daily price charts of some of the more successful European funds, you can see that for the past month these funds have held up well in absolute terms. They have also done better than mutual funds invested in most other world regions.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/a.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>SIA. Yet again; for the umpteenth consecutive month,  Japanese equity investments are held in check by the 21,000 to 22,000 point price ceiling on the Nikkei. I recommended selling Japanese funds in the New Year at 21,000 points after buying a few months before at 15,000. A great trade-if a weakening Yen hadn't devalued the profits. Instead of a 50% profit over three months, the net profit was more like 12%. Some funds employ currency hedging. Some funds also get the hedge wrong-it's one more investment decision than can go astray. I think that the Japanese markets are falling now because the US Dollar is weakening against the Yen and the Mark. Higher currency rates make for more expensive exports and lower profits. Hong Kong is still going sideways in the context of an uptrend.More patience is needed.<p><font size=-1 face=Arial><img src="../letters/l.gif" align=left vspace=1 hspace=1>ATIN AMERICA. Most Latin American markets have done badly during the last month. I was premature in putting a buy on these markets but as with last month's opinion, if you are in, stay in. Just don't add to your position at this point.<p>Finally, even Emerging Markets get their share of crooks. Last Saturday, the Jakarta Post advised readers that a string of "criminal hypnotists" had cheated thousands of Indonesian investors by persuading them to give up their valuables (send Allen your money). Some investors (buy Allen a car) were even persuaded to empty bank accounts and give the money to the (don't forget Allen) thieves. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/morgstan.gif">E.
