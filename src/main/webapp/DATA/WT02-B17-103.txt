<B>Hydrogen Storage in Engineered Microspheres;<br>
Glenn Rambach, Principal Investigator,<br>
<a href="http://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory</B></a>

<P>
The goal of this work is to develop a storage method that will permit 
large 
amounts of hydrogen to be stored and transported safely, effectively, and 

economically.  New, high-strength glass microspheres (essentially, tiny 
bubbles) can 
be filled with high-pressure hydrogen for convenient bulk storage and 
transport.  The 
walls of these microspheres, which can be 25 to 500 microns in diameter, 
are about 
1 micron thick.  We can fill them with hydrogen by first immersing them 
in a high-
pressure bath of hydrogen and then raising the temperature of the glass 
to 200-
400 C.  At this elevated temperature, the glass becomes highly permeable 
to 
hydrogen and the spheres fill up.  Cooling the microspheres to room 
temperature 
traps the hydrogen in them.  The glass microspheres then become safe, 
cost-effective carriers for the hydrogen.  Heating the microspheres again 
releases the 
hydrogen in them.
<P>
Commercially produced microspheres for hydrogen storage were first 
studied in the late 
1970s.  These microspheres usually had defects that limited the hoop 
stress at failure to 50,000 psi.  Researchers at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory developed a method for 
producing much stronger, defect-free microspheres.  These engineered 
microspheres have a 
hoop stress at failure of about 150,000 psi, permitting a threefold 
increase in the pressure limit for the engineered microspheres.  
Engineered microspheres could make the storage and 
transport of large amounts of hydrogen much more efficient.  An analysis 
indicates that hydrogen in glass microspheres that is transported by rail 
can be economically competitive with liquid hydrogen.

<b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b>
<p>The design for the pressurized, heated test system is complete.

 Hydrogen will be provided at pressures up to 8500 psi into a

temperature-controlled chamber.  Temperatures can be controlled

from 20&#176;C to 350&#176;C.  Hydrogen will be provided from

a prepressurized cylinder rated for 30,000 psi operation.  A preheater

volume and valve will permit the sequential process of heating

the spheres in the absence of high-pressure hydrogen, and then

exposing them to the preheated high-pressure hydrogen.  This will,

for the first time, permit an accurate measurement of the hydrogen

uptake rates by the spheres for a given temperature.

<P>

Microsphere bed loading will be accomplished by exposing heated

microspheres to heated hydrogen.  The increased permeability of

the glass permits rapid loading of the spheres to the external

pressure.  When the temperature is reduced to room temperature,

the permeability decrease &quot;traps&quot; the hydrogen in the

spheres.
