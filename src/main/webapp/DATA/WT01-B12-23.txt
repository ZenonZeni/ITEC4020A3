 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA </H2>

<P>  VITA-SAURUS is a naturally flavored, good tasting, chewable, multiple-type supplement for children of all ages. Older adults and individuals that have difficulty swallowing tablets can take it, too. A great deal of work and experience has gone into developing it.  It was developed  by  a  panel  including  pediatricians, biochemists and a pharmacist with years of experience in this field. They saw a need for a totally comprehensive multiple for children and VITA-SAURUS was designed and developed for that reason.</P>
<P>  We have challenged people to look in any drug store or health food store and try to find one that even comes close to VITA-SAURUS. None can be found. All other children's multiples contains Vitamins A, C, D and a small amount of B-Complex. For all practical purposes, most all other chewable products available are made in a base of regular table sugar and flavored with synthetic substances so they will taste like candy.  They are all loaded with different synthetic food coloring agents. (Studies have been done in several public school systems proving that the various food additives, including coloring agents, cause hyperkinetic children). These so called "nutritional products" usually gain their appeal by widespread intensive TV advertising, not because of their nutritional value.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NATURAL FLAVOR</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is flavored with a blend of natural extracts from citrus, pineapple, grape and cherry.  It is sweetened with fructose, a natural fruit sugar that does not stimulate the insulin response by the pancreas like regular table sugar. VITA-SAURUS does not contain any artificial coloring, flavoring agents or preservatives.</P>
<P>  Natural Beta-Carotene, which is totally safe even in large amounts, is used as the source of vitamin A. As in all  Life  Plus  products,  the  Vitamin  D  found  in VITA-SAURUS is natural Vitamin D-3 from fish liver oil. Also included are oil soluble Vitamins E and Vitamin K. Very few children's supplements contain Vitamin E and we know of none that contain Vitamin K.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MINERALS AND TRACE ELEMENTS</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is the only children's product that contains all of the trace minerals, Manganese, Copper, Zinc, Iodine, Selenium, Molybdenum, Chromium and Vanadium, in addition to the two standard important minerals, Calcium and Magnesium.</P>
<P>  Trace minerals are every bit as important in nutrition  as vitamins.  Chromium supports the pancreas in its production of insulin, which controls carbohydrate metabolism. Since children have a tendency to eat far too much sugar and other refined carbohydrates, Chromium is an important ingredient in any children's supplement.</P>
<P>  Selenium,  Molybdenum  and  Vanadium  are antioxidants that help fight the free radicals formed because of various pollutants, such as food preservatives in the diet and radiation from TV sets.   These free radicals can actually stimulate the formation of cancer. It is interesting to note that next to accidents, cancer is the leading cause of death today in children under the age of 19.</P>
<P>  In  addition  to  the  vitamins  and  minerals, VITA-SAURUS contains many additional associated nutrients.   The Citrus  Bioflavonoids,  Rutin and Hesperidin, that are synergistic with Vitamin C, are included.  VITA-SAURUS contains a full array of the B-Complex vitamins, plus Biotin and the valuable nutrients, PABA, Choline and Inositol.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IRON FREE</H2>
<P>  Iron is intentionally left out of VITA-SAURUS as the newest research shows that only slightly elevated amounts of it can cause the production of harmful free radicals in the body.</P>
 <P> VITA-SAURUS  is  the  most  rational  and comprehensive general nutritional product for children on the market today. There is nothing like it anywhere.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  VITA-SAURUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE VITA-SAURUS</H2>
<P>  It is recommended that one tablet be chewed twice a day, morning and evening, for children under 4 years of age. Children from 4 to 12 should take 2 tablets twice a day.   During periods of stress, such as colds, flu, infections, injuries, etc., double   the   dosage recommended. Older children and teenagers should begin taking <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A> instead.</P>
