The Department of Therapeutics is composed of four interactive divisions that have continued in their endeavors to evaluate, define and treat mood, anxiety and related disorders. As director of the department, Dr. Donald Klein provides scientific and administrative guidance on methodology, critical evaluation, and future directions of research.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A mutual exchange of ideas and techniques among the researchers has provided for growth within each division as well as for collaborations within the department and with other departments in the Institute. Below, each clinic describes its research projects of the past year.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Anxiety Disorders Clinic</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Anxiety Disorders Clinic has continued its work to advance an understanding of the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Efforts have been particularly concentrated on panic disorder and agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive-<BR>
compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety, hypochondriasis, post-traumatic stress disorder, and new areas of research activity involving the neuropsychiatric sequelae of Lyme disease, mixed anxiety and depression, and cross-cultural studies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Hispanic Anxiety Disorders Clinic, which provides services to monolingual Spanish-speaking patients, was first opened for services in August 1990 as part of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. In September 1991, we received NIMH funding in the form of an administrative supplement to a Program Project Grant (PPG). The Hispanic Clinic has now become one of the components of the PPG, and has received funding to study the phenomena of ataques de nervios in our Hispanic population. Pilot studies of ataque de nervios completed in our clinic in this area have revealed unique findings.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our satellite clinic established for research and clinical activities in Staten Island continues to complement Freedom From Fear's presence in Staten Island. In July 1993, Dr. Brian Fallon added to our family of satellites by opening a clinic, in collaboration with the Family Medicine Center of the St. Joseph Medical Center, located in Stamford, Connecticut.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A number of specific areas of study within the Anxiety Disorders CIinic have been quite active.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Panic Disorder</B>  An open trial of the 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron was completed in the earlier part of the year, under the direction of Dr. Michael Liebowitz. Results from this pilot were so favorable that a multi-center, industry supported, double-blind efficacy trial was initiated, which confirmed our findings. A full Phase-III development program is now under way in which we are participating. Ondansetron may work faster and be better tolerated than existing anti-panic medication treatments. A multi-center trial of sertraline in panic disorder has also begun in our clinic.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Franklin Schneier is directing an NIMH-funded study of the efficacy of another serotonergic medication, fluoxetine, in the treatment of panic disorder. This study, which compares fluoxetine to placebo and a standard medication, imipramine, is now in progress. Fluoxetine has become a commonly used medication for panic disorder even though controlled data are lacking. Related studies are examining the effects of long-term treatment and discontinuation of treatment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have also completed a study of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in panic disorder. The study was designed to test the CO2 hypersensitivity model of panic disorder by chemically raising brain CO2 to see if patients accommodate over time with decreased panic attacks. Preliminary results with acetazolamide appear to be modest.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Social Phobia</B>  Dr. Franklin Schneier completed an NIMH-funded double-blind study of moclobemide in social phobia. Moclobemide is an investigational MAO-A selective reversible MAO inhibitor which can be taken without dietary restrictions and has fewer adverse effects than standard MAOIs. However, in contrast to earlier findings, moclobemide in our study did not show potent effects in social phobia. A multi-center industry supported placebo-controlled trial also found results similar to ours.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We and other investigators have already shown that the nonselective MAOI phenelzine is effective in social phobia. We are now testing the efficacy of the selective MAO-B inhibitor L-deprenyl in social phobia. Efficacy in the MAO-B selective range would support dopaminergic involvement in social phobia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To follow-up on their collaboration which demonstrated the efficacy of both phenelzine and cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) in social phobia, Dr. Liebowitz and Dr. Richard Heimberg of SUNY at Albany were recently funded to study the acute efficacy of combined phenelzine and CBGT in comparison to single component treatments and placebo. In the earlier study, phenelzine had a faster rate of onset and somewhat greater acute efficacy than CBGT, while CBGT effect appeared more durable following treatment discontinuation. It is hoped that the combined treatment would maximize the benefits of both individual therapies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Schneier is continuing to study the effect of anxiety disorders on functioning and the impact of treatment, important clinical issues with implications for third party reimbursement. We also have pioneered the study of social phobia in subjects whose symptoms are secondary to medical disabilities such as familial intention tremor, stuttering, etc. A diagnostic classification and assessment study of secondary social phobia is now being developed. A recent study of social phobia symptoms among stutterers suggests that social phobia is a problem for a sizeable subgroup and that much of the functional impairment experienced by stutterers may be attributable to the severity of social phobia symptoms.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</B>  Dr. Randall D. Marshall is currently conducting an open trial of paroxetine for post-traumatic stress disorder. He is developing a psychotherapy research program for PTSD, and is also collaborating on a feasibility study of long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at Columbia. He is also investigating the incidence and relevance of childhood trauma in persons with anxiety disorder, a study which was made possible through a grant from the Sara Chait Foundation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Additionally, Dr. Marshall has received funding, in the form of a Basic Science Research Grant (BRSG) to assess the therapeutic alliance and personality in panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder in patients receiving medication and psychotherapy treatments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</B>  In collaboration with Dr. Edna Foa of the Medical College of Pennsylvania, we are nearing completion of an NIMH-supported double-blind, placebo-controlled study of clomipramine and behavioral therapy, a very important study for the field as a whole.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Fallon and Dr. Liebowitz completed their double-blind, placebo-controlled study of intravenous clomipramine (CMI) for patients with refractory OCD. The data indicate that the administration of CMI intravenously is safe and significantly more effective than IV placebo in these oral CMI refractory OCD patients. The improvement increased during the four-week non-blind evaluation period after the last infusion. These data suggest that IV CMI is an effective treatment for oral CMI refractory patients.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Liebowitz and colleagues in adult and child psychiatry have received funding from the Eli Lilly Company to complete an NIMH-funded comparison of fluoxetine and placebo in child and adolescent OCD.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Somatoform Disorders  </B>Dr. Fallon, Director of the Somatic Disorders Program, continues to conduct a placebo-controlled study of fluoxetine for patients with hypochondriasis. Redefined as having "Heightened Illness Concern," hypochondriacs are being recruited in New York, Staten Island, and at the St. Joseph Hospital Family Medicine Center. Dr. Fallon also received a grant to expand his somatoform studies to include a study of subthreshold somatization disorder, using hypnotic suggestion and imipramine vs. placebo. These somatoform studies are supported by grants to Dr. Fallon from the NIMH and a Psychiatric Institute Research Scientist Grant (PIRSG).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Lyme Disease  </B>Studies of the neuropsychiatric aspects of Lyme disease have continued under the direction of Dr. Fallon. In collaboration with the Department of Child Psychiatry, studies are being conducted assessing psychopathology among children with neurologic late Lyme disease. Studies of psychopathology among adults with Lyme are also in progress. In collaboration with Dr. Prohovnik and Dr. Mann of the Department of Neuroscience, studies of adults with Lyme encephalopathy are being conducted with neuropsychological assessments and brain imaging both before and after repeated antibiotic treatment. The results from these studies will have a significant impact upon the treatment of this illness. These studies are supported by grants to Dr. Fallon from the Lyme Research Foundation, the Marvel Platoff Foundation, the American Suicide Foundation, and a PIRSG.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Ataque de Nervios</B>  We have completed several studies of ataque de nervios, a label applied by Hispanics to a variety of emotional states involving loss of emotional control. We have found that in a clinical sample with anxiety and depression, ataque de nervios is often applied to what we would diagnose as panic attacks. CO2 challenge studies are planned to verify this. In addition, ataque symptoms seem to differ in patients with different psychiatric comorbidity, suggesting that ataque self-labeling may reflect features of coexisting psychiatric illness.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Staten Island Research Clinic</B>  The Staten Island Research Clinic located at Freedom From Fear in Staten Island continues to conduct research in the areas of depression, anxiety, and child psychiatric disorder. Sharon Davies, R.N. is our on-site clinic coordinator.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>St. Joseph Medical Center</B>  In July 1993, Dr. Fallon established a collaboration with the Family Medicine Center of the St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, Connecticut. Dr. Robert Feinstein, director of the Behavioral Medicine Program there, and Dr. Joseph Connelly, director of the Family Medicine Center, consider this collaboration an opportunity to conduct state-of-the-art research on hypochondriasis and somatization in the primary care setting. Donna Vermes, R.N. is our on-site clinic coordinator.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Depression Evaluation Service</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Depression Evaluation Service (DES) is a research clinic whose major goal is the identification of different subtypes of depressive disorders and of specific psychopharmacological treatment for these subtypes. We continue to study "atypical" depression, further refining the criteria. We are continuing the study comparing fluoxetine, imipramine, and placebo in atypical depressives. We anticipate that SSRIs will be as effective in this disorder as MAOIs. We have studied 120 patients and are at the halfway mark of this study.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During 1994, the DES completed a study of alcoholics with primary depression who were randomized to either imipramine or placebo treatment. The results are being prepared for publication and show that depression in alcoholics is treatable and when it responds, it is associated with decreases in drinking behavior. We then began a follow-up study with a similar design using fluoxetine (Prozac). Twenty patients have completed the study so far and Prozac is showing evidence of good safety and tolerability. The number of patients studied is too small to draw any conclusions about benefits as yet. This study is funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A pilot study was conducted randomly assigning non-depressed alcoholics to naltrexone (Trexan) or placebo. Nineteen patients have completed this study which shows excellent benefits for the active drug. This confirms two control studies in the literature in other populations of alcoholic patients.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A pilot study of measurement of receptors on platelet membranes in depressed patients was also begun. Preliminary data have been collected on a sample of normal control subjects as well as a sample of patients entering depression studies. The hope of this study is to confirm previous observations that platelet markers are abnormal in depressed patients and to explore whether this abnormality predicts treatment outcome. If this proves to be predictive, this would be the basis for submitting a grant application.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the past year, we have received NIH funding to assess the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy in HIV+ men with late stage illness. The clinical syndrome included loss of sexual desire with or without sexual dysfunction, often accompanied by low mood, low energy, low appetite, weight loss, and sometimes wasting. The study consists of 12 weeks of open treatment followed by a six-week double blind placebo controlled discontinuation trial. To date, of the first 81 men whose data have been analyzed, 85% <BR>
of study completers were clear-cut responders in terms of androgenic effect. Of the 44 study completers who had mood problems at baseline, 64% were rated as much improved. Another study, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Lange's Virology Lab at Roosevelt/<BR>
St. Luke's Hospital, is assessing the in vitro effects of testosterone cypionate on viral activity. This study is ongoing, and some pilot work is planned regarding possible extension to women with AIDS and clinical symptomatology.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We are in the third year of a five-year study of the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in treatment of Axis I depressive disorders in HIV+ men and women. To date, we are getting an excellent response to both active and placebo medication.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We completed studies of the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in methadone maintenance patients in collaboration with two community methadone clinics, Bridge Plaza Treatment Center (Ronald Brady, Clinic Director and Co-Investigator, and Long Island Jewish/Hillside Hospital).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Activities of 1994 include the following accomplishments:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Detailed data analysis on the imipramine versus placebo trial in depressed methadone patients, completed in the previous year, shows a robust antidepressant effect on mood outcome, and more modest effects on drug use.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A study of the power of the locally developed SCID-Substance Abuse Comorbidity version to predict remission of depression during methadone induction was completed and data analysis is underway.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The NIDA awarded funding on an RO1 for four years for a placebo-controlled trial of sertraline in depressed methadone patients (Dr. Nunes, Principal Investigator).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The NIDA awarded funding on a Center grant for medications development (Dr. Herbert Kleber, Principal Investigator) on which Dr. Nunes is Principal Investigator of Project 3, which involves a series of pharmacotherapy clinical trials for cocaine abuse.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Biological Studies Unit</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Biological Studies Unit (BSU) serves as a centralized research laboratory at Psychiatric Institute. The BSU provides well-maintained, state-of-the-art equipment and highly skilled technicians to investigators throughout the Institute and the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Since 1984, the BSU has also been part of the Mental Health Clinical Research Center (MHCRC). In addition to providing facilities, equipment, and staff to investigators funded by federal and private agencies, the BSU, as one of the arms of the MHCRC, runs its own research program with the main focus on the psychobiology of anxiety disorders.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The BSU maintains a sophisticated pulmonary laboratory capable of recording and analyzing on-line respiratory rate, tidal volume, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, oxygen consumption CO2 production on a breath-by-breath basis. Monitoring of respiration in ambulatory patients is also available. Aided by several ongoing RO1 grants, a series of respiratory challenges such as CO2 inhalation, hyperventilation, and breathing against increased airway resistance have been developed and perfected over the past several years. Respiratory challenges have also been conducted under "tryptophan depletion" condition and during varying "cognitive" environment. These methodologies led to an increasingly accurate description of the prominent respiratory abnormalities seen in panic disorder patients. As one of the four sites for the largest NIMH-sponsored treatment study of panic disorder, the BSU has made it possible to monitor the respiratory status of hundreds of panic disorder patients before and after medication and psychotherapy. Preliminary results indicate significant medication but not psychotherapy effects. The respiratory laboratory has also been utilized to assess the pulmonary physiology of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and depression. The established safety of these respiratory procedures prompted investigators to test children and adolescents with anxiety disorders as well. The inclusion of the elderly with anxiety disorders is the subject of a recently submitted RO1 grant from the BSU. <BR>
The longitudinal approach of examining the physiology of anxiety disorders through the lifespan is a major strength of this program.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to conducting studies in anxiety disorders, the BSU continues to accommodate research in depression, seasonal affective disorder, schizophrenia, HIV neuropsychiatry, drug abuse, and eating disorders. Newly proposed projects are reviewed for scientific merit and approved protocols are done. One of the greatest strengths of the BSU is that it allows investigators to conduct projects without having to invest in expensive technologies or in training new technical staff.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1994, after 10 years of directing the BSU, Dr. Jack Gorman became Deputy Director of Psychiatric Institute. Dr. Laszlo Papp, formerly Assistant Director of the BSU, was promoted to Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Director. Dr. Jeremy Coplan was named Assistant Director. Drs. Papp and Coplan are both supported by Scientist Development Awards from NIMH.
