Hospital Hits Cardiac Care Mortality Rate With
Heart Risk Assessment Program


The risk assessment program includes EKG, cholesterol
screening and blood pressure measurement. Patients receive a
coronary risk report on disk, which offers suggestions for avoiding
heart attack.

To reach more patients and intervene in the early stage of heart
disease - thus boosting performance and outcomes - Sarasota
Memorial Hospital implemented the Heart C.A.R.E. program, a cardiac
assessment and risk evaluation initiative.
Sarasota, Florida's second largest hospital, realized last year
that it was caring for only 5% of the patients in its service area
who were at risk for heart disease.
Announced less than a month ago, Heart C.A.R.E. has received
overwhelming response. The hospital has booked patients for
screening through May.
"It took off like lightening," says April Mason, director of
cardiovascular diagnostic service at Sarasota.
Heart C.A.R.E. accomplishes two goals: screening and educating
patients.
The 35-minute screening requires that a patient fast for 12 hours.
Evaluators get a detailed family and personal history from the
patient, such as eating and exercise habits. The patient receives
an electrocardiogram (EKG) and cholesterol test. Blood pressure
measurements, both in the arm and ankle, determine presence of
peripheral heart disease. Measurement of hip-to-waist ratio
determines level of obesity.
The hospital places this information on a computer disk, which the
patient receives as a coronary risk report. The seven-page report
details coronary risk overview, fitness profile and cardiovascular
fitness recommendations.
A learning guide tells the patient ways to prevent heart attacks
and heart disease and reduce risk factors.
The patient's doctor receives a copy of the coronary risk report.
But in many cases, patients don't have a doctor, so the hospital
refers them to an internist or  cardiologist.
Sarasota hopes to measure program outcomes in a year. In an
evaluation, the hospital will look at several interrelated factors
of success, such as acuity, intervention and morbidity rates.
But hospital officials have already recognized some kinks in the
system.
For instance, because "snowbirds" make up much of Sarasota's
population, follow-up becomes difficult. The hospital wants to
target the older, more permanent residents of the Sarasota area
through churches and businesses.
The hospital has targeted people 40 years and older and have paid
special attention to women, who don't realize they are at risk and
have lesser chances than men for surviving a heart attack. Sarasota
wants to lower the mortality rate for that group.
Currently, 94% of patients that Sarasota sees has acute heart
disease. The hospital wants to lower that rate. "It's outrageously
high," Mason says. "Some patients come straight from the airport to
the hospital complaining of chest pains."
Finally, the hospital hopes to raise from 5% to 45% the percentage
of Sarasota residents it treats who are at risk of heart disease.

Utah Targets Health Plans, Providers In Mandated,
Statewide Report Card Effort


The state could begin with patient satisfaction and
cost comparisons before tackling the more expensive and difficult
comparison of clinical outcomes.

Utah lawmakers could bring a statewide quality report card
initiative a step closer to reality this week, just days after
yielding to providers' demands that an outside vendor evaluate the
state's data collection process.
State Sen. John Holmgren (R), who introduced the Health Care
Quality bill (SB 171) Jan. 31, says the Senate should vote on the
measure this week. The bill strengthens the role of the Utah Health
Data Committee and calls for the committee to publish "comparative
analyses" of provider performance.
"I think a year from now you'll see [the report card system] up and
running," Holmgren says, noting the need for heightened
accountability in a state of under  2 million people where health
care is a major $4.5 billion industry.
The Utah Assn. of HealthCare Providers "insisted" that comparative
quality data collection and analysis be validated by an outside
vendor, says Rick Kinnersley, president of the association of 53
hospitals and eight health care systems.
Kinnersley says hospitals were "uncomfortable" with the Health Data
Committee's earlier validation of hospital discharge data. He
expects the state to begin with patient satisfaction and cost
comparisons before tackling the more expensive and difficult
comparison of clinical outcomes.
Under the Utah Health Data Authorization Act of 1990, the committee
may collect data on cost, quality of care, and access from any
provider. Hospitals were the first priority; the committee has
collected four years (1992-95) of hospital discharge all-payer
data.
Denise Love, committee executive secretary, says the group has
collected some financial data on hospital performance as well.
But other efforts were put on hold for a report card initiative
that provides better consumer information at the health plan level.
The Utah Health Data Committee's advisory committee is hashing out
the details of the report card to recommend to the full committee.
The advisory committee is talking to the provider community about
what data are now collected by plans, and looking at enrollee
satisfaction survey instrument models.
Discussions have not begun on specific data measures. Love notes
the committee is considering public dissemination of comparative
health plan data, perhaps at an aggregate level, while reserving
more detailed information for health plans' internal quality
improvement efforts.
The committee's future priorities may include comparative
performance reports on health systems, networks, or individual
providers, adds Love, who is also director of the Utah Department
of Health Office of Health Data Analysis.

Committee Outlines Criteria For HEDIS 3.0 Measures


The National Committee for Quality Assurance Committee on
Performance Measurement approved criteria for HEDIS 3.0 measures,
set for release this month. Attributes fall in three categories and
include:

o        Relevance.
  x  Meaningful. Decisionmakers should be able
to use the measures to understand clinical or economic differences
among plans; this will be enhanced if benchmarks or targets are
available.
  x  Health importance. The measure should
capture as much of the plan's activities relating to quality as
possible, including type of measure, prevalence and seriousness of
the related medical condition.
  x  Financial importance.
  x  Strategically important. The measure
should encourage plans to devote resources to activities that most
effectively maximize the health of members.
  x  Controllability. Health plans should be
able to take actions that improve their performance.
  x  Variance among plans. There should be
potentially wide variations across plans.
  x  Potential for improvement. There should be
substantial room for improvement on the measure.
o        Scientific validity.
  x  Reproducible. The measure should produce
the same results when repeated with the same population and in the
same setting.
  x  Accurate.
  x  Valid. It should make sense logically,
clinically and, where appropriate, financially. It should correlate
with other related measures.
  x  Risk adjustable. Factors outside the
plan's control should be adjusted for whenever possible and/or
stratified to account for differences in populations.
  x  Comparability of data sources. The above
dimensions of scientific validity should not be greatly affected if
plans use different data sources.
o        Feasibility.
  x  Precisely specified. The measure should
have clear methods for data collection and reporting.
  x  Reasonable cost. The measure should not
impose an inappropriate burden on plans.
  x  Confidential. Collecting data for the
measure should not involve any violation of member
confidentiality.
  x  Logistically feasible. The data required
for the measure should be available in the time period allowed for
collection and should not be subject to cultural or other barriers,
such as a satisfaction survey in English for Spanish-speaking
members.

The committee would not expect all measures to meet all attributes.

Quality Boils Down to Cost In Blue Cross Hospital Program


Hospitals seeking "Partnerships for Quality" status had to
meet some baseline quality standards, but the first year of the
program focuses on reimbursement, not performance.

Blue Cross of California is touting its recent placement of 85% of
participating hospitals within its statewide network as preferred
"Tier I" facilities and the rest as "Tier II," but officials
acknowledge the designation boils down to reimbursement rates, not
quality.
Hospitals within both "Partnerships for Quality" tiers have passed
a quality threshold that must be met in order to discuss
contracting and rates with Blue Cross affiliate CaliforniaCare
Health Plans, explains Dr. Jeffrey Rideout, vice president and
medical director of quality management for Woodland Hills,
Calif.-based Blue Cross of California.
Indeed, Rideout says the quality threshold is fairly low in order
to keep most of the network intact. "We didn't want to eliminate
many [participating hospitals], but we wanted to take the first
step to build the logic of quality performance into the contract,"
he says.
He says Blue Cross plans to become more discriminating over the
next few years as data are validated.

Tier I Hospitals Receive Preferred Status

Under the program, Tier I hospitals receive preferred status within
the network, prominent mention in marketing materials, and access
to electronic interfacing, quality and outcome support, and
utilization management from the company.
In contrast, patients face higher copayments at Tier II hospitals.
Contracting hospitals responding to a Blue Cross request for
proposal on "Partnerships for Quality" provided information on
quality and reimbursement rates, then received scores based on
comparisons within six peer categories.
The company expects to finalize designations for remaining
hospitals by the end of March.
Rideout notes Blue Cross runs programs parallel to the affiliated
hospital quality performance program: (1) a quality monitoring
program for medical groups and IPAs now in its fourth year; and (2)
an ongoing member survey on service and access.
Last year the medical group program used eight quality indicators,
including administrative and grievance rates; voluntary transfer
from one medical group to another for quality or access reasons;
and preventive measures.
Rideout says Blue Cross hopes to use its size and clout to initiate
statewide quality processes that smaller health plans cannot
negotiate.
The hospital program uses 10 quality indicators, including five
institution-specific measures on C-section rates; coronary artery
bypass graft (CABG) surgery rates; myocardial infarction with and
without catheterization; and perinatal mortality.
The indicators are supplemented by self-reported quality data
including JCAHO accreditation and any existing patient satisfaction
surveys and clinical pathways. Data are risk-adjusted, Rideout
says, but much of it is "very old" and some is controversial.
Contact Rideout at (510) 927-6111.

Outcomes Focus Helps Network Hike Survival Rate Above
Norm


An adult liver transplant calls for at least: 25
transplants per year; a program in exist- ence two years; a
transplanter with two years' post-fellowship experience who has
performed 50 cases as primary surgeon; an 80% survival rate at one
year; and a re-transplantation rate lower than 15% within the first
year.

A Minneapolis-based transplant network that focuses on outcomes
measurement and management achieved a 92% one-year survival rate
for liver transplant patients, topping the 77% national average
reported by the United Network of Organ Sharing.
United Resource Networks' 86% two-year survival rate was 14% above
a national average.
United HealthCare Corp. of Minneapolis founded United Resource
Networks in 1989 to manage the catastrophic costs of
transplantation: an end-stage disease management therapy. The
company sought out quality transplant facilities in areas with
United HealthCare HMOs, and packaged services - everything from
hospital and physician costs to organ procurement and  follow-up
expenses - in one contract.
United Resource Networks manages transplant outcomes measurement,
case management and pricing structures for 285 clients, covering
about 20 million lives. Most are HMOs, but clients also include
commercial insurers, the state of Colorado, and a couple of large,
self-funded employers.
Kirk Stapleton, president and founder, credits United Resource
Networks' work in facilitating access to quality care while
creating cost-control strategies - along with technological
advances - with improved patient outcomes and reduced costs over
the past several years.
Stapleton also cites estimated cost savings of 25%-30% per
transplant procedure. "Because we move a lot of volume, we bulk
purchase competitive packages for clients," he says. For example,
the company on average pays $178,198 on a $267,234 average bill for
a liver transplant at network facilities - an average savings of
33% per procedure.

Highlights of United Resource Networks' program include:
o        Using 38 registered nurses as
account managers to help clients manage benefits. The company
sometimes case manages individual patients.
o        Tracking outcomes at six months and
one-year for every patient "to quickly identify survival issues."
o        Recredentialing transplant sites
yearly. After the company started contracting for services, it
began looking beyond meeting price to tracking outcomes, using
guidelines from the American Society of Transplant Surgeons. 

Unlike HCFA, which reviews facilities for compliance only one time,
United returns every year to recredential sites. Stapleton notes
transplant surgeons change facilities, which can result in
different patient outcomes at a given site.
"We drop three to four programs a year on resurvey, looking at
specific organ outcomes," he says. Using 28 participating
facilities in the United States and two facilities in Canada,
United managed about 1,400 transplants in 1995.
The combined United/Specialty Care Institutes annual caseload
stands at 2,900. United plans to complete the acquisition of
competitor Specialty Care Institutes on July 1.
United's outcomes criteria, based on American College of Transplant
Surgeons guidelines, is reviewed by the company's medical
directors, all practicing transplant surgeons. 
Criteria are divided between adult and pediatric categories. An
adult liver transplant, for example, calls for at least: 25
transplants per year; a program in existence two years; a
transplanter with two years' post- fellowship experience who has
performed 50 cases as primary surgeon; an 80% survival rate at one
year; and a re-transplantation rate lower than 15% within the first
year.
"We won't contract with any program unless it meets our outcomes
criteria," Stapleton says. "We're religious about it."

MDs Develop QA Program For Managed Kidney Care


A medical group incorporates a patient advocate's care
model to develop a treatment path for dialysis patients covered by
managed care plans.

Southern California Permanente Medical Group and the American Assn.
of Kidney Patients will jointly develop a quality assurance program
for patients with severe kidney conditions.
Few dialysis patients are in managed care programs. In fact,
managed care plans cannot by law recruit dialysis patients, but do
care for members who develop end-stage renal disease, says Ramon
Hannah, assistant to the associate medical director and physician
manager of operations.
But that soon may change as capitated plans target dialysis care.
Worried about what this could mean for kidney patients, the
American Assn. of Kidney Patients developed a patient care model
that lays out rights and benefits for dialysis patients. The model
demands quality care and education about the disease.
The medical group, affiliated with the Southern California region
of Kaiser Permanente, persuaded the kidney group to look at the
medical group's award-winning program.
The Kaiser program sets several high standards for quality of care
and assigns nurse monitors to determine whether these standards are
met.
Indicators, such as the amount of dialysis a patient receives, tell
whether patient care is good.
The medical group will use the association's patient care model to
make improvements in its program. The improved plan is set for
implementation this spring.
Additional goal: prove the medical group is the best place for
patients who need renal disease care and results in the best
patient outcomes.
In measuring whether the program meets these goals, the group will
look at four factors: morbidity, mortality, rehospitalization and
rehabilitation rates.
The 450 patients enrolled in the group's internal program already
have better outcomes when compared to patients in other local
networks. The goal is to assure the similar rates for the group's
1,200 patients who use contract dialysis services, Hannah says.
"From a quality assurance perspective, it's a classic example of
success of quality assurance," Hannah says. "If you define
indicators and push providers to improve, good outcomes result. And
good outcomes does lower costs."

Risk Assessment Draws Fire; Regulators Say HMO Form OK


An HMO using a health risk appraisal tool finds that 60%
of members completing the survey reported behavioral changes to
improve health status.

A major Colorado HMO, stung by bad publicity over a clinical
quality tool that launched a state inquiry, now emphasizes to
members the survey is  voluntary and, as confidential medical
record information, can't be released without member authorization.
Kaiser's "Confidential Health Profile" form is a clinical tool that
serves as the "cornerstone" of the HMO's prevention program, "and
we have proof that it makes a difference," says Dr. Ned Calonge,
chairman of preventive medicine. The HMO's experience highlights
the troubles plans can have in collecting data for performance
improvement.
The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado at a December 1995
media briefing announced the ongoing dissemination of a
questionnaire seeking medical and lifestyle information on the
321,000-member HMO's adult members.
But the Colorado Division of Insurance launched an inquiry when the
media asked whether the HMO could penalize members by requiring
members supply the information in order to stay in the plan or to
receive treatment, or whether health profile information, such as
acknowledging HIV risk factors, could be used by other insurers to
deny coverage.
State regulators, after review and clarification from Kaiser,
concluded that no regulatory concerns exist and that the HMO is
taking appropriate action to ensure information remains
confidential.
The state also found no violation of a state insurance regulation
that prohibits the development of sexual orientation questions with
subsequent use of the information for underwriting purposes. The
HMO's questionnaire lists several risk factors for HIV infection or
AIDS, including "male homosexual or bisexual contacts," and asks
whether factors in the aggregate apply to the member.
Although the state required no action, Kaiser officials say the
HMO's cover letter accompanying the health profile now states the
survey is voluntary. And the HMO modified its medical record
release form to include members' approval or denial of release of
survey information.
The questionnaire consists of 40 questions for men and 51 questions
for women on such topics as smoking, exercise, dietary habits and
sexual activity. Members get a computer-generated personal health
risk profile suggesting ways to reduce risks and quantifying risks
through a pie chart that shows the number of years a change in each
unhealthy habit would add to life expectancy.
A multidisciplinary team of the HMO's physicians and nurses, along
with a consultant, in 1991 began  developing the survey based on
a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) health
risk appraisal form. Calonge says it evolved into the "shortest,
easiest form possible" through HMO physicians' input and member
focus groups' recommendations.

Survey Helps Create Whole-Life Algorithm

The CDC looked at predicted mortality for a person over a 10-year
period; Calonge says this underestimates risk. The HMO created a
whole-life algorithm summarizing risk over a lifetime.
Kaiser piloted the form in 1994, then reworded some questions and
added a query on depression.
Calonge says the health profile will continue to evolve. The HMO
may, for example, add questions on family history to determine
genetic predisposition to certain cancers, and fine-tune the pie
chart based on additional epidemiological information.
"The concept was to quantify risk factors in a way to motivate
behavioral changes," Calonge explains, noting the HMO expects
behavioral changes among members and greater utilization of
resource programs thanks to the questionnaire. In the pilot study,
more than 60% of members completing the health risk appraisal
reported behavioral changes or intended behavioral changes, vs. 30%
in the group not using the form.
Kaiser expects 70% of adult members will complete the health
profile, up from 40%. The HMO plans to use another mailing in the
second year, plus handouts in physician offices, to reach the
target. A 70% level "could really show a programmatic impact," he
says.
While confidentiality has not been an issue, Calonge says some
members object to the form's questions on birth control, sexually
transmitted diseases, and HIV risk factors. But he says such
queries are important to a comprehensive health risk appraisal.

REPORTS & SURVEYS


       With continuous changes in the
quantity and types of health care personnel providing services,
health plans and providers will increasingly need to monitor and
understand the various aspects of patient satisfaction, according
to "Tracking the System: American Health Care 1996." The report,
the fifth from the National Committee for Quality Healthcare, says
current patient satisfaction measurement tools "collect information
of questionable rigor." For a copy, call (202) 347-5731. Cost: $15.

       A Kaiser Permanente physician
completed a study on the effectiveness of fecal occult blood test
in detecting colorectal cancers and large polyps. Dr. James
Allison, in a study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, documents for the first time that fecal occult blood
tests can detect 1.5 to two times as many cancers and polyps as the
most-used test, Hemoccult II. Clinicians and health planners can
use the study data to recommend tests. Contact Kaiser at (510)
987-3900.

       In a study of nearly 2,000 seriously
ill hospital patients, only about one quarter said they didn't want
CPR used to save their lives - many fewer than researchers
expected, given the poor prognosis of the study group and the
likely outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of
cardiac arrest. After adjusting for demographics, severity of
illness and functional status, the Beth Israel Hospital researchers
found that a patient's diagnosis, his or her understanding of the
prognosis, and the institution where a patient was hospitalized
were some of the factors influencing decisions about whether to
forgo CPR. A patient's decision not to have CPR was associated with
a decrease in the intensity, not the quality, of patient care. It
also did not result in differences in hospital mortality rate. The
study was published in The American Journal of Medicine.

       Get a look at four methods for
conducting an internal quality assessment based on the
healthcare-specific Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award pilot
criteria. A new handbook, "Quality,  Assessment for Healthcare,"

implementation stages covering management workshops, focus groups,
surveys and an assessment based on comprehensive criteria. To order

Barber, call (800) 247-8519. Cost: $29.95, paperback.

       "The search for `best practices' to
benchmark the rates of surgery leads to those practices that have
adopted shared decision-making, because learning which rate is
right requires the active participation of the patient in the
decision process," say the authors of the "Dartmouth Atlas of
Health Care." For a copy, call (800) 242-2626.

       Hospitals in cities with high levels
of managed care report significantly lower costs, reduced length of
stay and decreased mortality rates, according to a national study
of 11.7 million patients at 3,700 acute care hospitals. The KPMG
Peat Marwick study, "The Impact of Managed Care on U.S. Markets,"
also finds the presence of managed care has not resulted in higher
mortality rates or complication rates. The risk-adjusted mortality
rates in high managed care markets were 5.25% below the national
average. For a copy of the study, call (800) 243-1397.

QUALITY BRIEFS


       The National Committee for Quality
Assurance next week will release information that will enable
people to compare information from hundreds of health plans. NCQA's
effort is culled from its national database for HEDIS and
accreditation information. For more information, contact Barry
Scholl of NCQA at (202) 955-3500.

       Watch for HCFA to announce this
month a Medicare "centers of excellence" program for cardiac and/or
orthopedic care, according to HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck. The
program currently bundles payments to designated coronary artery
bypass graft and cataract surgery facilities and gives seniors who
choose such facilities a rebate.

       Prudential HealthCare Group formed
a special unit, Health Management Programs, to build expert
guidelines, collect outcomes data, enhance patient and physician
education, provide case management and measure results - all aimed
at managing chronic illness. The plan will build on experience
garnered in its three-city asthma management pilot program in
January 1995. Other programs under consideration: diabetes,
depression and hypertension. Contact Prudential at (201) 802-4884.

       Humana Medical Plan Inc. of South
Florida won full accreditation from the National Committee for
Quality Assurance. NCQA denied the plan accreditation during its
first review of the HMO in 1993.

       HEDIS 3.0 should be used to measure
the quality of care a population is receiving and to assess whether
plan efforts are helping to improve public health, for example by
reducing tobacco use, according to members of the NCQA Committee on
Performance Measurement. At its last meeting, committee members
expressed interest in both medical care and other interventions,
such as weight loss programs, that the plan implements to improve
the health of its members. Contact NCQA at (202) 955-3500.

       The Colorado legislature shelved a
bill to implement a mandatory maternity stay after state insurers
and managed care plans agree to comply voluntarily with the bill's
provisions. The bill would have required plans to cover 48 hours of
hospital care following a normal delivery and 96 hours after a
C-section. Instead, plans agree to allow 48-hour stays without
reauthorization and to apply guidelines issued by the American
College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy of
Pediatrics when conducting utilization reviews and considering
authorization requests.
