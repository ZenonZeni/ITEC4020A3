<a name="RTFToC2">Clinton
Changes US Policy on Haitian Refugees</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On May 9, President Bill Clinton announced major changes in US policy
toward Haiti, reflecting increasing impatience with the failure of Haiti's
military leadership to restore democracy.  The president announced that the INS
would conduct asylum hearings for Haitian refugees intercepted at sea,
reversing the policy of returning Haitians and instructing them to submit their
applications for asylum in Haiti.  Clinton also announced the appointment of a
Haitian special envoy--William Gray, the head of the United Negro College Fund
and a former House majority whip.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Despite the change in policy, the INS has continued to return Haitians
leaving the country in small boats--over 1,300 boat people were returned to
Haiti in May after the change in policy was announced, while 2,000 Cubans and
Haitians have landed in Florida.  As in the past, the Cubans are released, and
the Haitians are sent to a detention center where they are screened.  Some
Florida politicians are calling for the INS to deputize local police so that,
in an immigration emergency, they could help to deal with a mass arrival of
Cubans or Haitians.<u></u></tt><p>
<tt><u></u></tt><p>
<tt><u></u>The US is discussing with nearby countries, including the Bahamas
and Belize, the possibility of setting up a temporary shelter for fleeing
Haitians.  The US does not want to house Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay in
Cuba, and it fears that cruise ships rented to house Haitian asylum seekers
while their cases are heard will soon be full.  <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton said on May 19 that the possibility of a "massive
outflow" of Haitians is the most important of the six reasons why the US may
use force to restore democratically-elected president Aristide to power 32
months after his ouster by military forces.  On May 21, tough new UN economic
sanctions were imposed on Haiti.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
and Campaign 94 in California</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration continues to be a headline issue in California.  Governor Pete
Wilson, running for re-election, unveiled a television ad that shows Mexicans
running en masse through the San Diego port of entry.  Wilson accuses his major
Democratic rival of saying that illegal immigration is not a problem, while he
reminds viewers that he is suing the federal government for the costs incurred
by California to provide services to illegal aliens.  Ron Unz, who is
challenging Wilson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, has adopted a
pro-immigrant and anti-welfare state position.  He argues that "anti-immigrant"
Blacks, union members, and environmentalists are Democratic party stalwarts,
and that Republicans should embrace immigration but reject bilingual education
and affirmative action.  The primary election--in which political parties
select their candidates--is June 7th. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The "Save Our State" initiative collected about 600,000 signatures--far
more than the 387,974 registered voters required-- to qualify an initiative for
the November 8th ballot.  If passed, the initiative would attempt to deny
public education, non-emergency public health care services and most other
social services to illegal aliens, and require state agencies to report any
illegal aliens they detect to the attorney general (some of these services must
be provided to illegal aliens according to federal laws or court orders).  A
Los Angeles Times poll of  1,471 registered voters questioned between May 21
and 25 found that respondents approve the initiative 59 percent to 32 percent.
A majority of Hispanics and Blacks polled oppose the measure, but whites favor
it 64 percent to 26 percent.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt> On May 28, Latinos throughout California rallied against the
"anti-immigrant hysteria" in this year's California election.  The protests
ranged from a march through of 8,000 or more in Los Angeles to picketing
Governor Wilson's reelection headquarters in Sacramento. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California state legislators have decided to put off until after the
November election a possibly contentious debate about problems along the
California-Mexican border, especially the issue of providing free public
education to US citizen children who live in Mexico.  The issue was raised by a
videotape, made by the staff of freshman Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith, which
showed children crossing into the US from Mexico and boarding a bus for a US
school--the schools are eager to enroll these children, since they receive
payments for each pupil.  A bi-partisan task force will hold public hearings
after the November election on residency and border issues, including problems
with low-income housing and poverty in San Diego County.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The state's $55 billion budget, currently moving through the
Democratic-controlled Legislature for the 1994-95 fiscal year that begins on
July 1, includes $3 billion that the state is requesting the federal government
to reimburse for services provided to illegal aliens.  Even though there is
little hope that California will get (fully) reimbursed, and despite some
discomfort with Wilson's attacks on illegal immigration, Democratic legislators
have kept the hoped-for reimbursement in the budget so as "not to undercut the
Governor's request."</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt><u>Los Angeles Times</u> editorial writer Jack Miles reviewed Mexican
academic Jorge Castaneda's argument that California is becoming less democratic
because it includes an ever-increasing number of aliens ineligible to vote.
Castaneda argued, in an article published last year in <u>The California-Mexico
Collection</u>, that California should follow the example of the Scandinavian
countries and extend at least local voting rights to non-citizens.  Miles then
reviewed the Border Patrol's success in holding the line on the US-Mexican
border in West Texas--by moving Border Patrol agents from the interior to the
border, apprehensions of illegal aliens fell from 800 to 1,000 daily to 150.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Miles advances the proposal to link effective border control with another
legalization program in a repeat of the 1986 IRCA, which linked sanctions and
amnesty.  He considers this unlikely Grand Bargain better than the status quo.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A poll conducted last month by the Hospital Council of San Diego and
Imperial Counties found that two-thirds of the respondents thought that
hospitals should deny emergency care to illegal aliens.  Under current law,
hospitals are required to treat all emergency patients regardless of their
ability to pay or immigration status.  According to the Hospital Council,
border county hospitals get from $36 to $50 million in Medi-Cal payments to
cover the unreimbursed costs for emergency care for illegal immigrants. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Incomplete
Amnesty</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 included two distinct
legalization programs:  one based on residence in the US before January 1, 1982
(LAW), and the other based on having done at least 90 days of farmwork in
1985-86 (SAW).  To the surprise of many observers, the number of SAWS was 1.1
million, or equivalent to two-thirds of the 1.7 million LAWS, even though it
was widely asserted that only 10 to 20 percent of all illegal aliens worked in
agriculture.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The SAW program was the last-minute compromise that enabled IRCA to be
enacted, but it has proven to have major flaws.  First, there was enormous
fraud in the SAW program--the best estimates are that as many as two out of
three people who were granted legal status did not in fact qualify, but
eligibility rules were written in a manner that required the US government to
prove that the alien was lying, rather than requiring the alien to convince the
government of his eligibility.  Second, the fraud in the SAW program encouraged
the expansion of the fraudulent documents industry, and farmers began to hire
more of their workers through labor contractors. Thus, enforcing labor and
immigration laws in a labor market that hires 1.5 to 2 million seasonal workers
each year--two-thirds of whom are immigrants--became more difficult.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>SAW left a third human dilemma--only workers were legalized, in the false
hope that they would leave their families in Mexico and commute legally to
seasonal US farm jobs.  Instead, many brought their families to the US,
producing mixed families, such as a family with a legal immigrant father (most
SAWS are young men), an illegal alien mother and several illegal children, a US
citizen baby, and perhaps a child protected by a "family fairness" provision
enacted in the 1990 IMMACT to prevent the breakup of families.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Illegal aliens who want the protection of "family fairness" must have
arrived illegally in the US before May 1988 and apply for protection from
deportation to the INS.  As of March 30, 1993, only 66,198 illegal aliens
applied for "family fairness" protection, and 56,495 received it.  However,
there are an increasing number of stories of children threatened with
deportation because they cannot satisfy the requirements to be protected under
"family fairness."  In a typical profile, a five year-old--born after May
1988--is threatened with deportation after her mother sneaked her into the US
because she cannot qualify for "family fairness."  Activists estimate that
there are 100,000 children in California who are illegal aliens and cannot
satisfy family fairness criteria to stay legally, prompting California
Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-LA) to introduce a resolution that
would ask the federal government to grant a Temporary Protected Status to all
of the illegal alien children in mixed families. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Asian
Immigrant Poverty</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>More than 30 percent of the Southeast Asians in the US--versus eight
percent of all American residents-- are on welfare, the highest rate of welfare
participation of any ethnic group.  The seven million Asians in the US are
three percent of the US population.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In a study released by the Asian Pacific American Public Policy Institute,
Paul Ong of UCLA concluded that the economic status of Asian-Americans has a
barbell or hourglass shape--for every family with an income over $75,000, there
is another Asian-American family with an income of less than $10,000.  Over
one-third of all Asian-Americans 25 and older have a college degree or more,
while almost one-fourth do not have a high-school diploma.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About 300,000 of the one million Southeast Asians in the US are on welfare;
they comprise about two percent of the US Aid to Families and Dependent
Children population of 15 million.  The first wave of Southeast Asian
refugees--urban and educated Vietnamese who arrived between 1975 and
1978--integrated fairly easily and successfully.  Later waves of Southeast
Asian refugees included more rural peasants--three-fourths of the adult
Southeast Asians on welfare in California have less than a high school
education.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Focus groups that ask people about health care reforms find that by
margins of 2-1 to 3-1, participants oppose providing tax-supported health care
benefits to non-US citizens.  A House Republican proposal to reform welfare
begins with "The Problem: Too Much Welfare For Too Many Immigrants," asserting
that 11 percent of all welfare recipients, and 20 percent of elderly on
welfare, are not US citizens.  The latest version of the Clinton welfare plan
would raise $3.3 billion of its $9.5 billion additional cost over five years by
reducing federal aid to non-US citizens.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Texas,
Arizona Sue Federal Government</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Texas announced on May 26 that it plans to sue the federal government for
the costs it incurs to provide services to the estimated 550,000 illegal aliens
in the state.  Texas has not yet decided how much federal reimbursement to
request, but in the fall of 1993, it was estimated that the cost of state and
local services was nearly $500 million, some of which was offset by sales and
other taxes and fees--other sources say that Texas will request $1
billion.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Unlike the California lawsuit filed last month, Texas Governor Ann Richards
went out of her way to describe the suit as a federal-state dispute over
unfunded federal mandates, not as an attack on illegal immigrants.  Richards
supports Operation Hold-the-Line, which has been able to reduce illegal entries
into El Paso by concentrating INS agents on the border.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Arizona joined the list of states suing the federal government by filing
suit in early May for the $121 million the state allegedly spends to imprison
illegal aliens.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>States view the requirement that they must provide services to illegal
aliens as unfunded federal mandates:  the federal government fails to stop
illegal aliens, but requires cities and states to provide services to them.  In
California, 40 percent of the babies born on Medicaid are born to illegal alien
mothers, and 17 percent of the state's prisoners are illegal aliens. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most observers believe that these state suits will fail; California failed
to win the reimbursement it sought to care for illegal aliens in 1989-90.  A
major constitutional problem is that state suits to force the federal
government to pay certain costs in particular states run afoul of Congress's
prerogative to decide on federal spending.  A political problem is that over 80
percent of the immigrants are in just six states and, even within these state
Congressional delegations, there is disagreement over whether additional
federal funds should go to more enforcement or to reimburse state governments
for service costs.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canadian
Immigration Targets for 1994</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Despite a 1993 poll that found that 47 percent of Canadians believe that
the country is accepting too many immigrants, and pressure from the Reform
Party to reduce immigration, Canada in February 1994 announced that it would
maintain the previous government's target of 250,000 immigrants and refugees in
1994.  Some 111,000 of these immigrants are in the family category, whose
sponsors must promise to support them for 10 years.  Another 86,700
non-sponsored immigrants are expected; they are selected on the basis of a
point system that gives preference to younger professionals.  Canada will also
admit up to  24,000 investor immigrants.  Canada announced that it was prepared
to admit 28,300 refugees in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Reform Party wanted immigration reduced to 150,000 because of
persisting high unemployment.  The unemployment rate was 11 percent in April,
1994.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of persons applying for refugee status at Canadian borders fell
from 37,720 in 1992 to 20,492 in 1993, a decline attributed in part to a
February 1993 law that requires refugee applicants to be fingerprinted and to
pay a $360 fee.  Canada now stations immigration officers at airports overseas
who prevent aliens likely to request asylum in Canada from boarding planes that
would fly them there.  Airlines and shipping companies must pay a fine of
C$5000 for each illegal alien they bring into Canada.  Some provinces are
tightening refugee access to social services:  Ontario is ending health
services for refugees on June 1, 1994, expecting the federal government to
provide for them.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi has said his office will tighten
controls on entrepreneurial visas which give landed or permanent immigrant
status to aliens who invest at least US$181,000 in a Canadian business and
create one or more jobs for Canadians. Thousands of Hong Kong residents have
used entrepreneurial visas to emigrate to Canada.  The immigration minister
claims that many do not keep their part of the bargain by investing and
creating jobs.  In the first nine months of 1993, 28,217 immigrants arrived
from Hong Kong, about one-fifth of them with entrepreneurial visas. </tt><p>

Revises Asylum Policies</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On March 29, 1994, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner
Doris Meissner announced a grant-refer system to more quickly grant asylum when
warranted, and refer claims in doubt to immigration judges.  In order to double
the number of asylum officers from 150 to 334, the INS will charge a fee of
$130 to those who can afford to pay--the INS puts the average cost of
adjudicating each asylum application at $615.  Asylum applicants will not be
eligible to apply for employment authorization until at least 150 days after
their </tt><p>
<tt>filing date.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of immigrants expected to arrive in California is projected to
drop by almost 50 percent, from 300,000 in 1993 to 207,500 in 1994, according
to Nancy Bolton of the UCLA</tt><p>
<tt>Business Forecasting Project.  Some 200,000 more Californians are expected
to leave than arrive from other states in 1994, 10 percent as an aftereffect of
the January 17 Northridge earthquake.  This means that the state will have
practically no increase in population due to immigration for one of the few
years since 1940.  The immigrants are arriving from Mexico, Vietnam, the
Philippines; Californians are migrating to Washington, Arizona, and Nevada.

<a name="RTFToC13">European-American
Immigration Convergence?</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Will similarities in the nature of the twin problems of controlling
unwanted immigration and absorbing newcomers lead to a convergence of European
and American immigration and integration policies?  A conference of 70 leading
American and European researchers and policy makers in Charleston, South
Carolina on May 13-14 sponsored by the European Communities Studies Association
discussed the gap between immigration goals and realities on both sides of the
Atlantic, and worried about whether current steps taken to promote integration
will be successful.  They reached apparent consensus on three points: 1)
immigration pressures in Europe and the US are rising and are unlikely to soon
abate; 2) there is no compelling economic or demographic case for opening
borders now to mass migration; and 3) there are no clear historical or
contemporary models that provide beacons to guide integration policies.</tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>European Concerns</tt><p>
<tt>The 12-nation European Union in 1992 had a population of 347 million.  By
2025, the population of the EU-12 is projected to fall to 340 million.  There
were 14.2 million legally-present foreigners in EU countries in 1990, and 4.9
million or one-third of them were citizens of one EU nation living in another,
i.e. there are 9.3 million so-called third-country nationals in the EU, and
they represent less than three percent of the population. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>These data suggest that foreigners and immigration should not be major
concerns in Europe, yet immigration is a top political issue from the UK to
Italy.  There are several reasons.  First, many foreigners who reside in the EU
do not show up in these immigration data--those excluded include the one
million asylum seekers who arrived in EU nations since 1990, ethnic Germans
moving from Russia to Germany, and illegal aliens, estimated to number 2.5
million in 1990.  Even though massive east-to-west migration did not occur, as
some expected, the entry of one to two million newcomers annually forced the
member nations of the EU to take restrictive actions.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>European participants expressed conflicting opinions about whether there is
an immigration problem and what should be done about it.  For example, one
noted that the annual rate of immigration varies from over one percent in
Germany--one million newcomers arrived in 1992 in a country with a population
of 81 million--to 0.5 to 0.6 in the Benelux and Scandinavian countries, to 0.1
to 0.3 in southern Europe.  However, it was noted that concern about
immigration was not two to five times greater in Germany than elsewhere,
suggesting to a European observer that rates of immigration were about what
European countries wanted them to be.  Furthermore, it was argued that European
governments prefer that immigrants remain illegal--most European illegal aliens
arrive as legal tourists-- so that they fill seasonal and low wage jobs but are
less likely to become residents since they cannot easily gain access to public
housing or social services.  European governments, in this view, can try to
further tighten controls or tackle the root causes of emigration and integrate
those immigrants who do settle until emigration pressures diminish.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Other Europeans took the view that the perception of out-of-control
migration was dangerous because it allowed generally conservative parties to
appeal to voters with open or subtle anti-foreigner appeals.  In France,
Germany, and the UK, it was argued, conservative political parties played the
anti-immigrant card to gain votes, although when the political elite from all
parties agreed that immigration had gotten too hot to handle, they developed
compromises to "take immigration out of politics," as Germany reportedly did
with its asylum compromise in the fall of 1992.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Explaining the Gap</tt><p>
<tt>Several participants developed theories to explain why there is a gap
between generally restictionist immigration policy goals in Western Europe and
the US and the immigration reality of larger-than-anticipated
immigration--there is, it was said, nothing more practical than a good theory.
Most theories of why immigration control is difficult to achieve deal at least
in part with the liberal paradox--the notion that industrial democracies push
nations to embrace free trade and investment, and warn them that their failure
to open their borders to free trade will result in slower economic growth and
less World Bank and IMF funds.  On the other hand, industrial nations complain
that now open-developing economies are sending workers over industrial-country
borders. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The most interesting theory of why there is a gap between immigration
policy goals and outcomes was based on the behavior of three "actors" in
industrial countries:  individual voters, organized interest groups, and
government officials.  According to this theory, individual voters are
rationally ignorant about the true nature of the benefits and costs of a
phenomenon as complex as mass or unskilled immigration--labor migration,
whether legal or illegal, tends to produce immediate and fairly concentrated
benefits, while its costs are deferred and hard to measure.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In such a situation, effective immigration control is akin to a public good
that has no effective advocate.  Organized groups that benefit from mass
immigration, and the government actors who regulate immigration, can ignore
restrictionist public opinion, especially when the economy is booming.  This
gives immigration in the industrial democracies an expansionist flavor, since
it takes a long time to mobilize restrictionist public opinion.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This theory suggests that immigration will typically be higher than public
opinion would support, especially since elites in the traditional immigration
countries such as the US and Canada are pro-immigrant.  Furthermore, so long as
organized interest groups are able to re-label their immigration programs,
turning, for example, guestworker programs into seasonal and contract worker
programs, they can continue to have large numbers of immigrant workers
admitted.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Integration</tt><p>
<tt>There are many models of immigrant integration, and they have in common a
nostalgic sense that they worked in the past, but doubts that these same
integration models will work in the future.  The French "Republican" model,
which stressed public conformity to national values while tolerating private
expressions of religious and culture differences, American models from
"Americanization" to melting pot to salad bowl metaphors, and Scandinavian and
Dutch models of subsidizing and celebrating ethnic differences represent very
distinct integration models.  There was a great deal  of speculation about how
well these models are likely to work with the current wave of newcomers, but no
one seemed willing to assert that a particular model is "best" for any
particular EU country or for the US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cooperation and Convergence?</tt><p>
<tt>There are clearly new forces impinging on immigration policy making.  In
Europe, there is tension between the various EU bodies and national
governments, although its was stressed repeatedly that immigration remains the
domain of national governments, and talk of burden sharing is confined to
discussions of what to do about asylum seekers.  EU officials seem to embrace
the notion that cooperation in dealing with asylum applicants should also be
extended to other migration-related issues, from how to deal with the smuggling
of illegal aliens to providing aid that addresses the root causes of migration.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Rising migration pressure at a time when states' borders are becoming more
porous and public opinion in aging societies that are experiencing high
unemployment makes immigration a potentially explosive issue in industrial
democracies.  This conference provided a great deal of information on why it is
so hard to develop and implement effective immigration controls, but it
generated much less guidance for policymakers struggling to incrementally
adjust the doors so that the foreigners they want can easily enter, and the
foreigners they do not want are excluded. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Increased
Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric in the Netherlands</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The recession, immigration and unemployment have begun to erode the
Netherlands tolerance for immigrants.  In March 1994  elections, the extreme
right Central Democrats won three seats, while the extreme left Socialist Party
gained two seats in the 150-member Lower House of Parliament.  The Liberals,
who propose barring the children of illegal immigrants from school, gained nine
seats, and now hold 31, while the D66 party, which preaches ethnic and
religious tolerance, doubled their seats to 24. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The increased number of asylum seekers in the Netherlands and an increase
in racial violence reportedly helped the anti-immigrant Central Democrats and
the Center Party to gain seats in the March election.  The Central Democrats
have promised to repatriate all asylum seekers unless they face the death
penalty or life imprisonment in their homeland. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One Central Democrat member boasted during a television broadcast that he
set fire to immigrant hostels in the 1970s.  He was arrested for arson and
expelled from the party. Another Central Democrat local council member made
anti-Semitic remarks about migrant workers, prompting other council members to
call for prosecution for hate crimes.  A Dutch court found another far-right
member of Parliament guilty of making racist statements in 1989 and 1990 in
political party broadcasts and fined him $3,240.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Netherlands has tightened its border controls.  Immigration officials
are now stationed at the airports to identify those suspected of entering the
country and then illegally overstaying their tourist visas.  They are now
expelled immediately.  Airplanes take aerial photographs of suspected illegal
entrants crossing Dutch borders so that the Netherlands can prove that an
asylum seeker entered from Belgium or Germany and should be returned there to
apply for asylum.  Beginning June 1, the Dutch police will be able check the
identification papers of anyone . </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, there were 35,400 asylum seekers in the Netherlands, double the
1992 figure of 17,450, and requiring the expenditure of $500 million--about
$14,000 per applicant.  About half of the asylum applicants were granted safe
haven.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Dutch asylum procedures have been streamlined so that most cases can be
handled within 24 hours, and difficult cases can be decided in six months
instead of the seven years it previously took.  Beginning July 1, 1994, two
central registers will be created in the Netherlands to which all asylum
seekers, except those landing at Schiphol Airport, will have to submit their
asylum applications.  Since April 27, 1994, the Dutch government has been
detaining rejected asylum seekers until their deportation, and it estimates
that 4,000 asylum seekers will be detained this year.  The Dutch government is
preparing a list of "safe countries"--asylum applicants from these countries
have the burden of proving that they face persecution--that must include at
least all of the countries on Germany's list.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">British
Immigration: Rules Changed, Numbers Up</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The British Home Office presented to the Parliament new immigration rules
which will go into effect October 1, 1994.  The new rules eliminate references
to gender in immigration categories, creates a entrepreneurial business
category, tighten rules on private students and hospital patients to eliminate
abuse, and set up a new clearance system for vacationing youth from throughout
the Commonwealth who work in the UK to support themselves.  The new
"entrepreneurial investor" status will allow wealthy foreigners to live in the
UK for one year if they demonstrate that they have at least L1million (US $1.5
million) and agree to invest L750,000 (US$1.13 million) in UK government bonds,
stocks, or corporate bonds.  Investors must make Britain their main home and,
if they can maintain themselves without employment, their stay can be extended
for three years. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A Home Office report noted that in 1993, 55,000 people were granted
residence in the UK, up from 2,900 in 1992.  Over half of the immigrants were
from India, the Caribbean and former British colonies in Africa.  Nearly 44
percent were from non-Commonwealth countries and the remainder were from
Australia, New Zealand and Canada. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were 22,400 asylum seekers in Britain (excluding dependent relatives
and children), five times the number who applied six years ago, but a drop of
2,200 from 1992.  Under public pressure, the British Home Office has decided to
end the use of Pentonville Prison to detain asylum seekers.  Asylum seekers at
the Campfield House near Oxford held a hunger strike in March to protest the
use of the prison to house asylum seekers.  A detention center run by the
Immigration Service will house asylum seekers in a wing of Rochester Prison in
Kent.  There are 637 asylum seekers being held in detention centers in Britain.

<tt>The anti-immigrant British National Party (BNP) lost its only sitting city

<a name="RTFToC16">Asylum
in Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>From Sweden to Spain, European governments fearing that a wave of asylum
seekers threatens prosperity and social cohesion have tightened access to and
eligibility for asylum.  Critics of the crackdown on asylum complain that it
may result in genuine refugees being returned to face persecution, and that
closing the asylum door encourages illegal alien smuggling.  The number of
illegal aliens in Western Europe has been estimated to be 2.5 million, but that
may be too low--an airplane crash into an apartment building in Amsterdam in
October 1992 revealed that many of the victims were illegal aliens.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On April 12, the parliamentary committee of the Council of Europe in
Strasbourg urged the creation of a European Refugee Commission to coordinate
the asylum procedures of the member states, the appointment of a European High
Commissioner for Refugees to work with the UN Commissioner for Refugees, and
the establishment of a fund to assist countries with  large numbers of
refugees.  The Council also asked European countries to accept more refugees.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A European Union representative  requested that EU development funds be
appropriated to Albania, Bosnia and Croatia to help stem illegal immigration.
The proposal is supported by Greece and Germany--both have large numbers of
illegal immigrants fleeing from the poverty in Albania and the war in Croatia.
The issue was raised at an informal meeting of EU ministers May 6-7 in Greece.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Europeans, the southern European nations of Greece, Italy,
Portugal, and Spain have already closed their doors to legal immigrants and
asylum seekers because illegal immigration is considered to be out of
control--the number of asylum seekers in these four countries fell from 89,278
in 1992--95 percent in Spain--to 41,675--90 percent in Spain.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>
<IMG SRC="MN June 1994.rft 1.gif"></tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in the 16 western European nations was 494,784
in 1991, 671,510 in 1992, and 543,658 in 1993.  The number of asylum seekers
fell by 26 percent in Germany between 1992 and 1993, but rose 75 percent in the

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Asylum Seekers and Illegal Immigration<i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>In April, a total of 12,164 people applied for asylum in Germany,
bringing the total to 47,986 for the first four months of 1994.<b>  </b>Over
14,000 were from Serbia and Montenegro, 6,500 from Turkey, 4,400 from Romania
and 2,800 from Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The German border police report that they
have stopped the recent increase in illegal entrants who arrive by air.  The
number of ethnic Germans<b> </b>arriving in Germany was 65,234, up slightly
from the first four months of 1993--they are considered German citizens upon
their arrival and are not counted in German immigration statistics.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stricter border controls have been in force since April 1st to prevent
asylum seekers from entering Germany by ferry.  The ferry companies in Norway,
Sweden and Finland must now check whether passengers have valid immigration
documents --the companies are liable for fines between DM 2,100 and DM 31,900
if they transport passengers without the proper permits.  In Hamburg, local
officials have been accused of selling residence permits for DM1,000 to DM3,000
each.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The German government signed an agreement on April 25 with Croatia which
outlines a two-step process for the "repatriation" of Croatian war refugees
starting May 1, 1994.  The state of Bavaria plans to gradually "repatriate"
90,000 civil war refugees from Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germans Invest in Polish Factories Near Border</tt><p>
<tt>German employers are investing in factories just inside the Polish border
to take advantage of wages that are one-seventh those of the former East
Germany.  One garment manufacturer reported that Polish hourly wages of DM3
($1.80) are just one-eight of Berlin wages of D25.  Poland has the fastest
growth rate among the former Eastern Block nations but, according to one
German, the German-Polish wage gap is twice the US-Mexican gap.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Hate Crimes</tt><p>
<tt>In Magdeburg in the former east Germany, German youth drinking on Ascension
Day (May 12) beat up five Africans on a downtown street and then followed them
into the Turkish-owned cafe where they took refuge.  Several Turkish customers
stabbed four of the German youth, and for hours afterward Germans and
non-Germans attacked each other on the streets, leading Commissioner for Alien
Affairs Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen to assert that anti-foreigner violence had
hit a new "high point."  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In response, the German Government introduced new laws against
racially-motivated crimes. They would increase jail sentences, utilize
preventative detention and punish those who deny the Nazi atrocities of World
War II. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Nationality</tt><p>
<tt>Less than five percent of the major groups of foreigners in
Germany--including Turks, Croats, and Italians--become naturalized German
citizens.  Under current law, most foreigners must live in Germany for 15
years, and then renounce their allegiance to their native country, e.g. Turkish
citizenship to become a naturalized German citizen.  Commissioner for Alien
Affairs Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen in February 1994 introduced a package of
measures that would have made naturalization easier by permitting dual
citizenship and reduced from 15 to eight years the required period of residence
in Germany, but the Kohl government in March 1994 rejected her proposals.
Under current law, a Turk born in Germany must at age 16 apply for a work
permit.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Bundestag on April 28 rejected two bills that would have facilitated
naturalization and dual citizenship.  Commissioner for Alien Affairs Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen discussed the possibility of resigning in frustration.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC23">South
Korean Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>South Korea has experienced one of the world's fastest migration
transitions:  in 1982, over 200,000 Korean workers emigrated, and in 1994, the
South Korean government is debating how to deal with the 20,000 foreign
"trainees" and 50,000 to 100,000 illegal aliens who arrived with tourist or
student visas.  Officials routinely announce that the country will need 100,000
foreign workers to overcome the labor shortages arising from rapid economic
growth (an average real 8.5 percent per year rate between 1985 and 1992),
affluence ($6,800 GNP per capita in 1992), and a slow growing population (the
44 million population increases by one percent annually).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Under a plan scheduled to go into effect on June 1, 1994, South Korea will
crack down on illegal alien workers and permit the Korean Federation for Small
Business to import up to 20,000 foreign trainees for 4,200 small businesses.
They will be housed, fed, and paid $260 per month.  Initial quotas allocate
8,000 slots to China and 3,000 to the Philippines.  </tt><p>
<tt> </tt><p>
<tt>Alternatives</tt><p>
<tt>In a talk delivered to the Korean Federation for Small Business April 19,
1994, Roger Bohning of the International Labour Office argued that "undesired
jobs" are at the bottom of all firm, industry, and societal labor markets, and
that rapid economic and job growth and slow labor force growth gives rise to a
widening scissors labor shortage, as the demand for workers to fill undesired
jobs increases, while the supply of domestic workers willing to fill them
shrinks.  In Korea, Bohning notes, wages rise with the size of the firm in
manufacturing, and the wages of skilled workers are rising relative to
unskilled workers, leading to an acute labor shortage for small firms.  This
makes Korea different from Western Europe, where large firms experienced labor
shortages that were filled by guestworkers in the 1960s.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Bohning concludes that the current policy of admitting trainees and
tolerating illegal aliens is not sustainable--in part because the monthly wage
paid to trainees is less than usual illegal earnings.  He recommends that the
trainee system be abolished, that the employment of illegal aliens be deterred
by fining the employers who hire them, and that a legal guestworker system be
established after consultations with employer and worker representatives
(p21).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Defector Bonuses </tt><p>
<tt>South Korea has changed its policy of offering cash to defectors from North
Korea because of an expected flight of refugees escaping the worsening North
Korean economy. Previously, defectors received $19,000 to $31,000 for
resettlement and a reward of gold for information or equipment from North
Korea.  Since the start of the program, about 100 North Koreans have defected
south.  One defector reportedly received $630,000 in government support in
1987. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>An ad-hoc committee will  examine possible ways to help the defectors
adjust to South Korea and live on their own.  Recent defectors have said food
shortages are forceing the North Korean government to loosen movement
restrictions to search for food and, as a result, some North Koreans are using
the opportunity to escape into neighboring China and South Korea.  Experts say
that 2,000 North Koreans are hiding in China, but that 80 percent of those who
flee there are returned to North Korea.  Thousands of North Koreans are working
in Siberia as contract loggers.  Analysts predict that conflict or a collapse
of the economy could force as many as two million North Koreans to seek refuge
in other countries </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>If North Korea's economy collapsed, analysts predict that 4.5 million
people would flee south, and that the cost of unification would exceed $1.2
trillion.  North Korea, with 23 million people, is about half as populous as
South Korea, with 44 million, but the North's GNP is believed to be less than
10 percent as large as South Korea's $300 billion GNP.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC24">China
Loosens Internal Migration Controls</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China is planning to change its decades-old rules that restrict internal
migration.  The government will, as soon as June 1, 1994, relax rules which
currently prevent farmers from settling in cites.  No rural-urban influx is
expected: at most, it is predicted, several million peasants will apply for
permanent residence in the cities.  The reform of the registration system
(registration in an area is necessary to obtain housing and coupons for
rationed goods) will also regularize the status of the 20 to 30 million
peasants "illegally" living in cities. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 100 million internal migrants in China, a number
equivalent to the worldwide population of persons living outside their
countries of citizenship.  The Chinese registration system was coming under
strain because of the uneven economic boom in the country--the economy has been
grew in real terms by six percent annually between 1985 and 1992, but much of
the job growth was in the urban areas of southeastern China.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Internal Chinese migrants send remittances to their villages of origin:  50
billion yuan, or US$5.7 billion, by one estimate.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Under the revised registration system, internal migrant workers must carry
their ID card, work permit and single status or family planning certificate.
Many Chinese states have formal procedures through which migrant workers must
find jobs, including signing up with the local labor service office.  Through
this mechanism, Beijing feels it has effectively managed migration throughout
the country. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In October 1993, the Chinese Ministry of Labor published an urban and rural
employment coordination plan which called for organizing the rural labor exodus
through legitimate channels, for regional governments to formulate necessary
labor market rules and management systems to handle migrant workers, and to
improve services to migrant workers during their trans-regional travel.  The
Ministry hopes that the implementation of these measures will ensure an orderly
flow of labor throughout the country by 1996.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Internal Chinese migrants may look to emigrate.  Russia, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Spain, Japan, Indonesia, among others, have expressed concern that
deteriorating conditions and internal migration within China could lead to a
mass exodus.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China's Labor Ministry reported that it found jobs for only 1.2 million o f
the 5.4 million urban workers who were laid off in 1993. There are reportedly
100 million underemployed Chinese peasants. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The 47,000 foreign-funded firms operating in China are to have unions to
cover their six million Chinese workers within two years.  There have been
disputes over foreign "exploitation" of Chinese workers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Effects
of 1997 Vary</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>With China preparing for its takeover of Hong Kong in 1997, there is a
debate about whether the increased availability of low-wage mainlanders will
depress wages and displace higher-paid Hong Kong residents.  The popularity of
the recent program to bring 1,000 mainland Chinese professionals into Hong Kong
as management trainees has been cited as an example of how Hong Kong workers
might be replaced by Chinese mainlanders.  The 100,000 Filipino maids in Hong
Kong have expressed fears that they will be replaced with lower-paid Chinese
domestics after 1997, echoing similar concerns of other unskilled foreign
workers now in Hong Kong.  There are already 23,000 mainland Chinese working in
Hong Kong on temporary permits and over 10,000 employees of Chinese-owned firms
have special visas. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of Hong Kong residents leaving the protectorate prior to 1997
dropped 20 percent to 53,000, in 1993.  The recession in Western countries and
reduced immigration quotas are believed to have caused the decline.  In 1991,
60,000 residents left the country, and 66,000 in 1992.  Most go to Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the United States. </tt><p>

Changes its Foreign Worker Program--Again</a>
</a></h2>

<tt>The Taiwan Council of Labor Affairs announced that foreign workers should
have the same benefits as native staff in businesses with more than 50
employees.  The council recommended that businesses collect 0.5 percent from
the wages from the foreign workers to place in an employee welfare pool.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to the Taiwan Interior Ministry, approximately 207,500 foreigners
were living in the country at the end of March 1994,  including 21,012 illegal
aliens.  The ministry approved employer applications to bring 169,417 foreign
workers to Taiwan in 1993, and 83,701 foreign workers were in Taiwan as of late
March, 1994.  But the Council of Labor Affairs imposed stricter rules on
foreign employment, limiting alien workers to 30 percent of the work force in
any firm.  Employers also will not be allowed to increase the number of foreign
workers they employ; they can only replace vacancies created by foreign workers
who leave.  Currently, each employer has a set number of jobs which can be
filled by foreign workers--each of whom can remain for two years--under the new
guideline the period of stay will be extended to three years. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Malaysia:
Mixed Signals on Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia stopped the recruitment of unskilled and semi-skilled foreign
workers on January 7, 1994 in order to give the government time to reassert
control over illegal immigration--there are believed to be 500,000 to 1.5
million illegal aliens in Malaysia, meaning that illegals outnumber legal
foreign workers by 5 or 6 to 1.  However, in March 1994, the government
permitted a labor-short factory to bring "skilled" factory operatives into the
country, even though these "skilled" workers were paid unskilled worker wages.
In May 1994, the government permitted federal agencies that operate plantations
to import unskilled foreign workers legally despite the recruitment ban.
Private employers immediately wanted to know why they too could not recruit
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>To add to the policy confusion, the Deputy Home Minister of Malaysia
asserted that 100,000 more Indonesians were needed to supplement Malaysia's
plantation work force, which includes workers from Bangladesh, Pakistan, India
and the Philippines.  Under an agreement with Indonesia, a consortium of labor
supply agents will be established to improve coordination and monitoring of
foreign workers by ensuring that all workers sent legally to Malaysia meet at
least minimum health, security and experience requirements.  Only recruitment
agents who join the consortium will be recognized by Malaysia's Home Ministry.
According to Malaysian authorities, ninety percent of the 500,000 foreign
workers in Malaysia are Indonesian (other estimates put the number of foreign
workers at one to two million).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>During the first meeting of the Joint Committee for Border Cooperation held
in early May, Malaysia and the Philippines agreed to tighten border controls in
Sabah, where an estimated 500,000 Filipinos are 40 percent of the population.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Minister of Science, Technology and Environment unveiled a
new plan to bring foreign scientists and engineers to the country.  He
predicted that by the year 2000, 56,000 engineers will be needed in the
country, versus the current 20,000.  The ministry plans to visit developing
countries to recruit engineers to work in Malaysia. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in Malaysia will be offered personal accident insurance
coverage by the Malaysia National Insurance Company.  The insurance will be
offered to workers on an individual basis, and in late summer, group policies
will be available to recruitment agencies.  The group policy will pay benefits
in the event of accidental death, permanent and total disablement, funeral
expenses, and costs associated with returning the worker home.  The company
hopes to sign up one million foreign workers in the first year. </tt><p>

Quota Increased in Australia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Australia will be increasing its number of immigrants in 1994-95 by 10,000
to 86,000, including 13,000 refugees.  Most of the additional immigration slots
are reserved for Chinese students who came to Australia after the Tiananmen
Square massacre.  The business migration program will also be expanded--the
hope is to attract and keep wealthy Hong Kong business migrants in Australia
instead of losing them to Canada.  Over the next year, 73,000 immigrants will
be admitted under family reunion, skilled, business and investment criteria, an
additional 13,000 will enter on humanitarian grounds, and 750 as other
refugees.  The number of skilled migrants will rise from 17,000 last year to
25,000 in 1994-95, and those under the family reunification program will
increase by 2,000 to 47,000. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The redesigned business skills category will require applicants to invest
at least Australian $750,000 (US$535,500) in government securities for three
years, demonstrate a record of business or investment achievement, and have
English-language proficiency.  The new rules include allowing temporary
residents who have established successful businesses to remain permanently in
Australia, instead of leaving Australia to apply for immigrant status from
abroad. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants to Australia may find life difficult.  Unemployment has hovered
at 10 percent over the past two years, and over one-third of the 949,200
unemployed have been jobless for one year or more.  A new study by the
Australian Bureau of Immigration and Population Research found that some
migrants cannot find employment because of the recession and changing attitudes
towards newcomers. The study-- based on immigrants in Adelaide--recommends new
programs to educate Australians to accept immigrants--especially about their
contributions to society.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Another study by the Bureau of Immigration Research explored the status of
the nearly 120,000 Vietnamese immigrants in Australia.  Their unemployment rate
is about three times the rate of the general population, and double that for
all migrants from non-English speaking countries, and their median annual
income is $8,300, nearly $5,900 less than for those born in Australia.  Nearly
all the Vietnamese live in large cities, with 75 percent in Melbourne or
Sydney. </tt><p>

Setting the record Straight</u>.  Available for $10 from the Urban Institute,
2100 M St NW, Wash DC, 20037.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This well-written monograph explains that US immigration policy seeks to
admit legal immigrants and refugees and keep out illegal aliens in order to
achieve the social goal of family unification, the economic goal of growth, the
cultural goal of promoting diversity, the moral goal of providing safe haven,
and the security goal of preventing illegal immigration.  Annual immigration is
estimated to be 1.1 million but, because 400,000 immigrants die or emigrate
every year, net immigration is 700,000 per year.  These mostly Asian and Latin
American immigrants are concentrated in eight cities in six states.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Two substantive chapters review data on the labor market and public finance
impacts of recent immigrants.  The best indicator of economic success in the US
is years of education.  If US-born persons are ranked by their years of
education, the result is a diamond-shape--in 1990, 23 percent of those 25 and
older had less than a high-school education, 57 percent had a high school
diploma, and 20 percent had at least a college degree.  If recent immigrants
are similarly arrayed, the distribution has an hourglass shape--41 percent of
those 25 and older had less than a high-school education, 35 percent had a high
school diploma, and 24 percent had at least a college degree.  Making a
distribution for subgroups of immigrants indicates that Mexicans and Central
Americans have a pyramid shape--75 percent lack a high-school diploma, while
only five percent have a college degree.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The federal government makes and enforces immigration laws, while state and
local governments provide most of the public assistance to integrate
immigrants, from education for immigrant children to welfare.  The Urban
Institute is currently reviewing various studies of the costs and benefits of
immigrants to federal, state, and local governments, and it concludes that, on
balance, immigrants pay more in taxes than they use in benefits, but the taxes
they pay are primarily Social Security taxes paid to the federal government,
while the education, justice, and health services they use are provided and
paid for by state and local governments.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This 111-page report was prepared by Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, Germany's
Commission for Alien Affairs.  As a result of the law that changed Germany's
asylum procedures on July 1, 1993, there will be an annual report of foreigners
in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were about 6.8 million foreigners living in Germany at the end of
1993, making them 8.5 percent of the population.  About three-fourths are from
non-EU countries, including 28 percent from Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners in Germany rose by two million since 1989,
excluding ethnic Germans who become German citizens upon their arrival from the
former Soviet Union.  Nonetheless, most foreigners in Germany have been in
Germany 10 or more years, and three-fourths of the foreign children in Germany
were born there.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are signs of convergence and divergence.  Foreign children are a much
larger fraction of those in the 16-19 age group that can be apprentices than
they are of the apprentices in training, and the unemployment rate for foreign
workers is about 1.5 times that of Germans.  Foreigners remain concentrated in
older apartments abandoned by Germans, and they often suffer discrimination in
the housing market.  As a result of the Maastricht Treaty, EU foreigners living
in Germany will gain the right to vote in local and European Parliament
elections, but non-EU foreigners will not. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The report ends with a call for a policy to regulate immigration, and a
policy to promote the integration of foreigners.</tt><p>

Paper presented at the World Bank's Annual Bank Conference on Development
Economics.  April 28-29.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This paper concludes that European governments were able to initiate
demand-pull labor migration during the 1960s, but have been less successful
controlling supply-push and network migration since the 1970s.  According to
Zimmermann's analysis, migration from Yugoslavia and Turkey was always
dominated by supply-push factors, while migration from southern European
nations such as Spain and Portugal shifted from demand-pull to supply-push
after 1973.  Asylum seekers, according to Zimmermann, are influenced by
economic variables in choosing a country to seek asylum--instead of a
house-on-fire metaphor, a follow-friends-and-relatives-to-opportunity metaphor
may be more appropriate.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As in the US, more recent cohorts of immigrants, especially those who are
ethnically or culturally different, seem to be having a harder time catching up
to similar natives in earnings.  Although the studies reach contradictory
conclusions, even based on the same data, one study by Zimmermann found that in
Germany, a one percent increase in the share of foreigners in the workforce
reduces average hourly earnings by 4.1 percent, or by DM 0.70 ($.42) from an
average DM17.70 ($10.72).  However, the wages of more numerous blue-collar
workers fall 5.9 percent, and the wages of white collar workers rise 3.5
percent.(p31).</tt><p>

<tt>Stark, Oded.  1994.  <u>Frontier Issues in International Migration</u>.
Paper presented at the World Bank's Annual Bank Conference on Development
Economics.  April 28-29.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This paper extends the author's thinking from the relationship between
migrants and their families at home to migrants and their employers abroad.
Three questions are posed:  why do some migrants return even though wage gaps
remain, why do those who settle abroad continue to send remittances, and why do
migrants seem to catch up and surpass similar natives in earnings?  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stark asserts that employers who have incomplete information on migrants
hire all of them initially at a low wage but, after they are on the job, the
better migrants obtain higher wages and the lesser-skilled migrants return (the
so-called return of failure).  High-skilled migrants who settle allegedly remit
some of their savings for selfish reasons--to keep low-skilled migrants from
joining them abroad and perhaps lowering their wages.  Third, in a lengthy
description of migrants and nonmigrants, and cooperative and noncooperative
agents who provide information about opportunities abroad, Stark finds that
migrants with cooperative agents who go abroad will do better than nonmigrants
who stay at home. </tt><p>

<tt>The <u>Social Contract's</u> Spring 1994 issue includes six immigration
articles.  Editor John Tanton's "End of the Migration Epoch" argues that the
medical revolution of the 17th century allowed the world's population to grow;
that the industrial revolution made rural-urban and later overseas migration
necessary, while the transportation revolution made long-distance travel easier
and cheaper; and that the communications revolution made potential migrants
aware of opportunities elsewhere.  Kingsley Davis noted that during the
1820-1920 migration epoch, historical patterns were reversed, as migrants moved
from more to less densely settled areas rather than from rural to urban areas.

in 1991-92 in San Diego county.  Of the 587 women interviewed, 12 percent (75)
said they crossed the border specifically for prenatal care or to deliver their
baby; 78 percent (459) lived in the US or crossed the border, but not
specifically to have their babies, and 9 percent (53) did not report why they
crossed.  The "crossers"--women who came specifically to the US to deliver
their baby--went to the US because: 1) they wanted a baby born in US (65
percent), 2) the medical attention is better in US (59 percent) and 3) medical
personnel are friendly and receptive (37 percent).  Almost all of the
"noncrossers" were born in Mexico--83 percent--indicating that they had in fact
crossed the border, but for reasons other than having a baby in the US.</tt><p>
<tt><u></u></tt><p>
<tt><u></u>Overall, only 14 percent of the women had health insurance; 70
percent had access to Medi-Cal.  This lack of health insurance was a
significant barrier in getting prenatal care.  A considerable proportion of the
border crossing women were high risk and required specialized medical care.
The report recommends joint planning on both sides of border to develop
strategies to provide adequate care for the women, such as using public nurses
to provide follow-up care for high-risk pregnancies on both sides of the
border. </tt><p>

also wrote a </tt><p>
<tt>112-page <u>Report of Infant Mortality Study San Diego County</u> (Third
Party Publishing Company, Oakland, CA. 1994) that examined infant mortality in
San Diego County.  The report explores the major causes of infant death and
recommends that the community establish a system for prenatal care to reduce
the mortality rate.  During the 1980s, San Diego County experienced a plateau
in the infant, neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates--in 1985 there were
8.8 deaths per 1000 live births, and in 1990 there were 7.2 deaths.  During
this period, the number of live births increased, as did the percentage of
minority mothers and babies requiring maternal and infant care increased.
