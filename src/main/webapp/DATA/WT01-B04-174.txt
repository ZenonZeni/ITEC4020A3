<H2><CENTER>POSITION STATEMENT ON DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT</CENTER>
</H2>
<STRONG>Introduction:</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Drug treatment is an effective means of recovering from drug use and maintaining
a drug-free lifestyle for those who are addicted to alcohol and other drugs.
Programs must be accountable and able to demonstrate drug-free outcomes.
Drug treatment can be cost effective in that it reduces other related health
care costs and costs associated with the criminal justice system such as
courts, legal prosecution and defense, and incarcerations. Drug treatment
should be made available, accessible, and accountable to those addicted
to alcohol and other drugs. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Background:</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Substance abuse is the number one health problem in America. More deaths,
illness, and disabilities derive directly from substance use than from any
other preventable health condition. The financial costs of substance abuse,
according to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
approach $400 billion annually. This does not include all the personal life
tragedies incurred by the individuals addicted and the sufferings borne
by their families, children, and friends. Almost 30% of all prisoners were
under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense. Furthermore,
in a sample of 23 American cities, 70% of all female arrestees tested positive
for drugs, and 30% to 78% of male arrestees likewise tested positive for
drugs. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Rationale:</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Drug treatment has multiple goals: maintaining a drug-free lifestyle; reducing
the demand for illegal drugs; reducing street crime; changing users' personal
values; developing educational and vocational capabilities; improving the
user's overall health; reducing fetal exposure to drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Different modalities of treatment have been demonstrated to be effective
to varying degrees in achieving, to some degree, the aforementioned treatment
goals. Furthermore, significant savings, in terms of court costs and imprisonment,
are achieved as a result of participating in drug treatment. Health care
costs are likewise reduced as a function of drug treatment. For every $1.00
expended in drug treatment, there is a cost offset of up to $4.00 saved
in related health care expenditures. <BR>
<BR>
By making treatment more available, making it a priority within the health
care delivery system, and insisting on it whenever possible, the costs of
criminal justice and health care systems that are mushrooming out of control
can be reduced. More importantly, an addicted person can have the opportunity
to engage in a life of recovery and make a positive contribution to his
or her community. An appropriate criticism of the current treatment framework
involving criminal addicts is the &quot;revolving door&quot; phenomenon.
Criminal addicts often receive treatment as an afterthought, but then cycle
through the criminal justice system with repeated relapses. <BR>
<BR>
A possible alternative to currently available treatment of criminal addicts
could include intensively supervised extended treatment, which also involves
an intensive overhaul of the addict's social and personal factors, while
integrating treatment into the criminal justice system. Thus, criminal addicts
could not use treatment as a means to reduce their sentences. Rather, sentences
would be spent in a treatment environment, and addicts would risk going
to criminal prison or remaining incarcerated if they continue to use drugs.
<BR>
<BR>
When it is said that treatment works, this doesn't mean that it works in
each and every instance. There are few medical interventions that work all
the time. For some, treatment is a framework for life that will never be
acceptable or applicable. For others, treatment is embraced and is a successful
way of life. Relapse occurs in many of those who finish treatment, but may
often be handled by short relapse focused refreshers. A great emphasis is
now placed on the eventuality of relapse and how to prevent it. <BR>
<BR>
Some treatment programs are more effective than others. Treatment is a continuum
of processes which on one hand may include only self help measures, and
at the other extreme may be extensive long term institutional processes.
It is also important to recognize coexistent conditions which reduce the
potential long term effectiveness of treatment. Effective programs must
incorporate the entire family system, relapse prevention, and aftercare
subsequent to the primary treatment program. The effectiveness of treatment
should be documented by drug testing and outcomes monitoring. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge to treatment professionals, then, is to identify those differences
in order to establish more effective and cost efficient treatment for society.
Every treatment program should also be able to demonstrate its effectiveness
and cost effectiveness to both the public and private payers. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Conclusion:</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Drug use and addiction is a complex human and societal problem. It must
be addressed from at least a threefold perspective: interdiction, prevention
and treatment. None of these interventions is by itself sufficient, but
in combination they are effective. They do reduce the amount of drugs that
are available, they do prevent initial use, and they do result in addicts
becoming drug free. <BR>
