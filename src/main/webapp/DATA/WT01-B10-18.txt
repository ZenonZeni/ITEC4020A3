<P>
&quot;I've had abnormal and painful periods ever since I went
through puberty, &quot;Carrie Y. told the support group. &quot;To
stop bleeding all of the time, I had to go on the Pill when I
was fifteen. The doctor told my mother that I wasn't ovulating
and might never conceive.
<P>
&quot;I lost my virginity on the operating table. I can't even
remember how many D&amp;Cs I had before I was twenty-five.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Did you cramp a lot?&quot; one member asked.
<P>
&quot;Yes, but I thought everyone cramped and that having pain
with your periods was normal. The pain eventually got so bad that
when I was in my early twenties, I had to stay home during the
first two days of my period. I learned later that discomfort from
normal periods shouldn't interfere with your daily routines. But
since I never knew any differently, all of those years I didn't
question it.&quot; She paused. &quot;Not until that awful day.
My husband and I had decided to try to have a baby. I'd been taking
clomiphene for several months, to get me to ovulate, and my period was a week late. That
wasn't anything unusual, since my periods were frequently forty
to fifty days apart. But I'd been regular since I'd been on clomiphene.
When my basal body temperature stayed up that week, we both became
pretty excited. After two years of trying, I was sure I was pregnant.
<P>
&quot;But that morning at work I had terrible cramps, like I needed
to have a bowel movement. The pain in my side was so bad that
I had to go home. Later that afternoon I did go to the bathroom
and the pain stopped. But not for long. It became so severe that
I thought I was going to pass out. I called the doctor. I cried
all the way to the hospital.
<P>
&quot;After running some tests, he told me that I had either appendicitis
or a tubal pregnancy. I'd begun to spot, so I was afraid I was
losing a baby. He had me stay at the hospital overnight.
<P>
&quot;The next morning I was weak but I felt better. Since they'd
found some blood in my urine, the doctor thought I was passing
a kidney stone. And he sent me home.
<P>
&quot;The pain continued and the bleeding got worse, so I went
back to the hospital and had a D&amp;C. The doctor didn't think
I was pregnant because he couldn't find any tissue in the material
he removed.
<P>
&quot;When I returned home, the pain in my right side was gone,
but I was bleeding like a leaky faucet. I knew it wasn't right.
I was a D&amp;C expert by then. Another thing that puzzled me
was that my breasts were still swollen and tender. But when I
called the doctor, he didn't seem very concerned. He just said,
'You can expect some bleeding after a D&amp;C.'
<P>
&quot;Even though the bleeding continued, I returned to work.
In the middle of the morning, searing pain doubled me over. My
secretary rushed me to the hospital. I had an ectopic pregnancy
and had lost a quart of blood. That wasn't all I could have lost.
I nearly lost my right tube and ovary.&quot;
<P>
The group was quiet.
<P>
&quot;What caused it?&quot; a voice asked from the back row.
<P>
&quot;When they did my laparoscopy, they found out that I have
<A HREF="endohtml.html">endometriosis</A>. That's probably why my periods were screwed up.
<IMG align="right" SRC="adhes.gif" >The doctor said that my adhesions were so thick he could hardly
find my tubes.&quot;
<P>
&quot;What did you do?&quot; a woman asked.
<P>
&quot;First of all, I changed doctors. After all I'd been through,
I'd lost faith in him. My new doctor is performing a <a href="laprscpy.html">laparoscopy</a> next week. He believes he can clean out the adhesions and endometriosis
and possibly restore my tubes to normal.  We'll know more after the surgery.&quot;
<P>
<h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
Tubal problems are the leading cause of female fertility problems.
With the tremendous increase in PID and sexually transmitted infections,
and with the increased incidence of endometriosis, tubal problems
account for half of female infertility.
<P>
<B>What Causes Tubal Problems?</B>
<P>
A number of different problems can impair fallopian tube function:
<UL>
<LI>Abdominal adhesions and scar tissue that immobilize fallopian
tubes
<LI>Adhesions and scar tissue that prevent the egg from entering
the tube and traveling toward the uterus
<LI>Damage from an ectopic pregnancy or sterilization surgery
</UL>

<P>

<P>
These problems can be caused by a variety of events:
<UL>
<LI>Ruptured appendix
<LI>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
<LI>Gynecologic surgery
<LI>Postpartum infection
<LI>In utero DES exposure
<LI>Salpingitis isthmica nodosa
<LI>Endometriosis
<LI>Cesarean section
<LI>Bowel surgery
<LI>Ectopic pregnancy
<LI>Tuberculosis (genital)
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<img align="left" src="hydro.gif">When infection and disease attack delicate tubal structures, the
tubes may become deformed and cease to function. Trapped in adhesions
and scar tissue, they can no longer retrieve the egg and coax
it toward the uterus. Infection and damage from ectopic pregnancy
may strip the vital ciliated lining from the inner walls. When
this happens, <I>sperm cannot meet egg</I>, and fertilization
cannot occur. If the tubes are obstructed only partially, sperm
may be able to meet egg, but the developing embryo can become
trapped inside the tube and cause a painful and even life-threatening
ectopic pregnancy.                          
<P>
The PID epidemic alone is claiming the fertility of hundreds of
thousands of women each year. Up to 60% of women who have antibodies to chlamydia are unaware that they ever had an infection will this stealthy invader that can destroy your fallopian tubes and rob your fertility without the slightest hint. Fortunately microsurgery, laser
surgery, and in vitro fertilization techniques can restore fertility
to many of those victims.
<P>

<B>Diagnosing and Evaluating Tubal Problems</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>Normal Tubal Function</B>
<P>
<img align="right" src="stigma.jpg">The fallopian tube is an active, muscular organ that retrieves
the egg from the ovary and coaxes it toward the oncoming sperm.
If adhesions restrict the tube's mobility or if infection has
stripped the tiny cilia from the tubal lining the tube cannot
perform its vital job. The various tests I use will help me determine
if:
<UL>
<LI>The tubes are open (patent)
<LI>The fimbria are open and free to grasp the ovary
<LI>The tubes are free from adhesions so they can move
<LI>The inner lining of tiny hairs (cilia) is intact
</UL>

<P>

<P><a name="HSG">
I can evaluate tubal performance by tubal X ray (hysterosalpingogram), sonohysterosgraphy (an ultrasound test), 
laparoscopy (telescopic look into the abdomen), and tuboscopy
(telescopic look inside the tubes).</a>
<P>
<B>The Tubal X Ray: Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)</B>
<P>
<img align="right" src="hsgnl.gif">
<I><B>When to Perform an HSG</B></I>
<P>
When the woman's complaints or history indicates the possibility
of tubal problems, the HSG will give me an excellent first look
at the problem. I will order an HSG if she:
<UL>
<LI>Has a history of repeated vaginal infections
<LI>Suffered from one or more episodes of PID or postpartum infection
<LI>Has unexplained infertility
<LI>Has a history of abdominal surgery or ruptured appendix
<LI>Has had one or more ectopic pregnancies
<LI>If she has not conceived after <a href="tublrev.html">sterilization reversal</a> surgery
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I><B>Purpose of the HSG</B></I>
<P>
By squirting an opaque dye into your reproductive tract and taking
X rays, we can see an outline of the inside of your uterus and
tubes. The picture will reveal uterine abnormalities as well as
tubal problems such as blockage and dilation (hydrosalpinx). If
I'm planning a sterilization reversal, I can also see where the
tubes are blocked and how much normal tube remains attached to the uterus. The X-ray study will not only help me plan
the laparoscopy and possible surgery but also help corroborate
my other findings.
<P>
<I><B>Performing the HSG</B></I>
<P>
To ensure that an early pregnancy is not exposed to potentially
harmful X-ray dosage, your doctor will perform the HSG a few days
after your period stops. Before you have the X ray, you may be
premedicated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as: Aleve, Ultram or Motrin,
for example, or given a local anesthetic. Your doctor will insert
a small tube through the cervical opening. By forcing a syruplike
X-ray dye into your uterus, the X ray can take a picture of the
outline of your uterine cavity. As the dye travels into your fallopian
tubes, it outlines the tiny passages and spills into your abdominal cavity. This lets us know that your tubes are open.
<P>
<I><B>Interpreting HSG Findings</B></I>
<P>
If the tubes are not blocked by adhesions or scar tissue, the
dye will pour into the abdominal cavity. Demonstrating tubal patency
is one good sign; however, it does not guarantee that the tubes
will function normally.
<P>
The X-ray pictures also give us a rough estimate of the <I>quality</I>
of the tubal structure and the status of the tubal lining. If
the tube bulges, for example, we suspect a hydrosalpinx. And if
we do not see the folds inside the tube, we know there may be serious
abnormalities of the internal tubal architecture.
<P>
     
<P>
We can also see <a href="http://www.ivf.com/cme/hyst/img0025.gif">endometrial polyps,</a> <a href="http://www.ivf.com/cme/hyst/img0077.gif">submucus fibroids</a>, <a href="http://www.ivf.com/cme/hyst/img0019.gif">intrauterine
adhesions</a> (Asherman's Syndrome, synechia), <a href="bicorn.gif">congenital uterine cavity abnormalities</a> (ie.,uterine septum & bicornuate uterus), or the after-effects
of genital tuberculosis. <p>Proximal tubal obstruction is a condition where the tubes appear blocked where they join the uterus. In some patients this may be due to tubal spasm and will not be seen on a repeat HSG. For other women, proximal tubal obstruction indicates severe damage to the portion of the fallopian tube where it crosses the uterine wall or merely debris clogging the tubal opening. I can often correct this problem by performing a <a href="recanal.html">recanalization procedure</a> This involves passing a tiny wire through the uterine cavity, and into the fallopian tube thereby dislodging the offending debris. This procedure successfully restores tubal patency in at least one fallopian tube for up to 85% of patients. While up to one third of patients undergoing this procedure will conceive, it is of little or no benefit if the ends of the tube are also damaged.<p>

Approximately 4 percent of infertile
patients will have an abnormal HSG indicating salpingitis isthmica
nodosa, a little-understood condition that responds very poorly
to surgery. These couples could benefit most from in vitro procedures.
The X-ray study may or may not detect pelvic adhesions, mild hydrosalpinx,
endometriosis, tubal phimosis (clubbing of the fimbria at the
end of the tube), or immobility of the tube.
<P>
<I><B>Therapeutic Effects from the HSG</B></I>
<P>
Although the primary purpose for ordering the HSG is not therapeutic,
sometimes forcing the dye through the tubes will dislodge material
blocking the tube. Without further treatment a number of women
have become pregnant following the HSG.
<P>
<I><B>Potential Complications from the HSG Procedure</B></I>
<P>
Although complications from an HSG are infrequent, there is always
the possibility for bleeding, infection, cramping, and the termination
of an exposed pregnancy.
<P>
<B>Sonohysterography</B><p>
Advances in ultrasound have provided significant improvements in our ability to evaluate the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Sonohysterography placing a small amount of liquid into the uterus to better visualize the uterine cavity.<p>
The use of specialized protein solutions and color-flow doppler ultrasound allows us to visualize the liquid as it travels through the fallopian tubes and disperses in the abdomen. While this technique avoids X-Ray exposure, the cost of the dye and color-flow doppler ultrasound equipment limits use of this technique.  
<P>
<B><a name="lap">Laparoscopy</a></B>
<P>
<I><B>When to Perform a Laparoscopy</B></I>
<P>
Since the laparoscopy is a surgical procedure done under general
anesthesia, I attempt to rule out all other male and female fertility
factors before performing it.
<P>
Depending on the woman's age and history and the findings from
the workup, however, I may choose a more aggressive diagnostic
approach for a particular couple. I'm more likely to use the laparoscopy
sooner if the woman is in her thirties and/or if I find pelvic
pain.
<P>
Normally I will perform a laparoscopy for the following reasons:
<UL>
<LI>Suspected endometriosis
<li>Blocked fallopian tubes
<li>Ovarian cysts
<li>Unexplained pelvic pain
<li>Uterine fibroids that are in the outer layer of the uterus. 
<LI>Abnormal hysterosalpingogram findings
<LI>History of pelvic infection or surgery
<LI>Pre- and postoperative evaluation of tubal surgery
<LI>Failure to conceive after ovulation induction therapy
<LI>Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I><B>Purpose of the Laparoscopy</B></I>
<P>
The laparoscopy lets me visually inspect your reproductive organs.
I can see if the tubes are deformed, swollen, or trapped in adhesions;
I can see if the ends of the tubes are open and the fimbria functional;
and if adhesions are preventing the egg from migrating from the
ovary to the tubes. I can also detect the presence of endometriosis
and perform a number of surgical procedures to correct various
abnormalities. I will usually combine the the laparoscopic procedure with a diagnostic hysteroscopy to evaluate the inside of the uterine cavity. 
<P>
<I><B>Micro-Laparoscopy</B></I>
<P>
Recent advances in the development of surgical equipment allows us to visualize the abdominal cavity with instruments less than 3mm in diameter. Because the laparoscopic telescope is so small, it can be passed through a needle without making an incision in your abdomen. This requires a minimal amount of local anesthesia and sedation through an intravenous line. Most women who undergo this procedure are back to normal in a few hours.

Unfortunately, structures inside your abdomen such as the fallopian tubes, small bowel and ovaries can be very sensitive to manipulation, this technique is best for insuring that things are normal. In most cases if a significant abnormality is found, you will be put to sleep and a standard laparoscopy can be performed to correct the problem.
<P>
<I><B>Performing the Laparoscopy</B></I>
<P>
<P>
Since the period of greatest fertility immediately follows the
first surgery, I may recommend delaying surgery until a time when
I have optimized all other fertility factors and the couple is
ready to conceive.<p>
If I suspect you have endometriosis, I will perform the laparoscopy
shortly after your period stops. Excising the endometrial implants
at this time results in less bleeding and may reduce the likelihood of adhesion formation. (See also chapter
17, which discusses endometriosis in detail.)
<P>
A <a href="laprscpy.html">laparoscopy</a> can be performed on an outpatient basis. First,
you are given a general anesthesia. Then your doctor will slip
the laparoscope through a small incision in your belly button.
Through a second puncture just above your pubic bone, your doctor
will slip in a small probe to manipulate your organs. Pressurized
carbon dioxide gas forces your abdominal wall up and away from
the organs so your doctor can get a clear view. After you awake
from the anesthesia, you can return home. You may, however, wish
to take a day or two off from work following the surgery.
<P>
As with the HSG, your doctor will force a dye through your uterus
and tubes to demonstrate tubal patency (chromoputerbation). Many
times, however, the dye will flow through only one tube (preferential
flow) because that tube provides the least resistance. This does
not mean that the other tube is blocked; on the other hand, it
does not rule out that possibility either.
<P>
                 
<P>
Many corrective procedures can be performed during a laparoscopy,
thus saving the need for major surgery. Bipolar electrosurgery and laser
surgery offer the surgeon safe and effective tools for performing
these repairs. 

Many different types of laser equipment can be used for laparoscopic surgery (carbon dioxide, KTP, argon, and YAG). The laser uses light energy to cut, vaporize or cauterize tissue. Each laser system has advantages and disadvantages. Often the cost when a laser is used can be as much as $2000 more.<P>
Newer energy sources such as bipolar electrosurgery and the harmonic scalpel may be cheaper. Healing, adhesion formation, and pregnancy rates do not seem to depend on which method is used. Therefore, although most physicians prefer one or another surgical instrument, s/he will likely decide which instrument based on cost-effectiveness and the type of surgery planned.<p>
<P>
<B>Procedures Used During Laparoscopy</B>
<P>
The two most common surgical procedures performed with the laparoscope
are the cutting and removal (lysis) of thin pelvic adhesions surrounding
the ovaries, tubes, and uterus, and the  surgical removal of endometriosis implants. Sometimes I will sever nerves
to the uterus to relieve the pain associated with endometriosis, open a blocked fallopian tube or remove a large ovarian cyst. At present most, but not all tubal repairs can be performed with the laparoscope.
<p>
<P>
<I><B>Lysis of Adhesions</B></I>
<P>
In this procedure the surgeon removes adhesions (scar tissue)
with a laparscopic scissors, bipolar electrocautery instruments, harmonic scalpel, or laser. Best results are obtained if the band of scar tissue is removed and not just cut. Results appear to be better after laparoscopy than laparotomy. The adhesiolysis (cutting adhesions) is more effective preventing new adhesions from forming than they are after an operation to treat existent adhesions. <p>
<I><B>Salpingostomy/Fimbrioplasty (opening the fimbria and repairing
the tube)</B></I>
<P>
Sometimes infection, endometriosis or surgical trauma cause the &quot;petals&quot;
of the fimbria to close in on themselves much as a tulip might
close at night. Pressure from fluid building up inside the tube
causes the tube to dilate (hydrosalpinx). When this happens, it
is unlikely that the ciliated inner lining will be intact and
functional. I can use a laser or microscopic cautery needle to
carve an X-shaped incision at the end of the tube to allow the
&quot;petals&quot; to separate and fold back into their normal
position. If the fimbria are not restored by this procedure, I
can open the tube, but without fimbria the tube has little chance
of retrieving the egg. Women with severely damaged or atrophied fimbria
have less than a 10 percent chance of achieving pregnancy. In vitro fertilization may
offer the best chance for success. (See <a href="ch21mb.html">chapter 21</a> for a description
of in vitro fertilization.)
<P>
<I><B>Salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube)</B></I>
<P>
Occasionally a tube is in such poor condition that it must be
removed or sealed to give preference to the better tube. In vitro fertilization may be more successful if a large, dilated fallopian tube is removed prior to treatment. Bleeding
from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy may require that I tie off the blood
supply to the tube or remove the tube. Provided the woman has
one good tube, I may remove a diseased tube if it is damaged beyond repair and causing pain.
If both tubes are not functional or must be removed, I turn my
attention to freeing up the ovaries for in vitro egg retrieval
procedures.
<P>
<I><B>Removing an Ectopic Pregnancy</B></I>
<P>
While most ectopic pregnancies occur in women with no risk factors, often I will suspect ectopic pregnancy in women who have had surgical treatment of tubal abnormalities, previous ectopic pregnancies or an hCG titre that demonstrates a suboptimal rise. The hCG level should rise a minimum of 60% in 48hrs. After the level is above ~1800 miu/ml, I can usually see the pregnancy inside the uterus with transvaginal ultrasound. If the rise is repeated less than 60% or the pregnancy is not seen by a certain point, I will suspect either a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Oftentimes I will locate a gestational sac in the fallopian tube on ultrasound. If the diagnosis is made early enough when the pregnancy is small, the drug methtrexate can be used to dissolve the pregnancy and avoid surgery in up to 85% of those treated. If I have any doubt that an ectopic pregnancy exists, I may still choose to treat with methotrexate to avoid later complications and more expensive surgical treatments. <p>For those patients unwilling to receive methotrexate therapy, I will perform a laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. 
Sometimes the pregnancy is small enough that I can simply slit
open the tube lengthwise and carefully suction out the material.
It is not necessary to repair the tubal incision. The tube will heal
normally without being stitched. 
<P>
When a more advanced pregnancy ruptures the tube, I will snip
out the distorted portion of the tube to remove the pregnancy.
Because the tube has a greater tendency to bleed during pregnancy,
I will not reconnect the two ends at that time. If within a year
the woman does not conceive with the other tube, I may consider
further surgery to reconnect the tube.
<P>
<I><B>Removing the Ovary</B></I>
<P>
If at all possible, I try to conserve an ovary. If an ectopic
pregnancy implants on the ovary, however, destruction of the ovarian
tissue and excessive bleeding may require its removal. The ovary
may also have to be removed when it has been entirely replaced with endometriosis
(see &quot;<a href="endo1.jpg">Chocolate Cyst&quot;</a> in <a href="ch17mb.html">chapter 17</a>), when it becomes
tumorous or when it is painful. Sometimes ovarian enlargement
caused by a tumor or cyst may cause the ovary to twist and cut
off its blood supply. When this happens, I must remove the ovary.
As long as one ovary is intact, however, fertility should not
be compromised.    
<P>
<I><B>Therapeutic Results from the Laparoscopy</B></I>
<P>
About half of the time no evidence of a fertility problem is found.
(Oddly enough, of those with no abnormal findings, one-third will
get pregnant following the procedure.) Where a problem is identified,
about three-fourths of the time it is endometriosis and one-fourth
of the time adhesions. If repairs must be made to the fallopian
tubes and/or if microsurgery is needed, I will usually perform
abdominal surgery. (See the discussion of laparotomy below.)
<P>
Once a problem has been corrected (during the laparoscopy or during
subsequent abdominal surgery), you will have a 50-65 percent chance
of getting pregnant. Repeat attempts to correct fallopian tube abnormalities are less successful. <p>When pregnancy is achieved an ultrasound examination is recommended soon after the pregnancy is confirmed to determination its location. After tubal surgery, the pregnancy can implant in the fallopian tube in 10-15% of patients. <P>
<I><B>Potential Complications from the Laparoscopy</B></I>
<P>
Although complications are rare, the risks of the procedure include
injury to abdominal structures, infection in the bladder or incisions,
bleeding, allergies to medications, complications from general
anesthesia, and pelvic infections. Should damage occur to other
organs during the procedure, abdominal surgery may be required
to correct it.
<P>
<B>Falloposcopy</B>
<P>
Falloposcopy is an experimental technique that allows us to place
a scope directly inside the fallopian tube to examine the quality
of the mucosal lining. If I find bare patches, I know that the
woman is at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy and that reconstructive
tubal surgery will be less likely to restore her fertility.
<P>
Unfortunately, at present the procedure requires laparoscopy to gain access to the fimbriated end of the tube. New equipment will soon allow this procedure to be performed by passing tiny catheters through the cervix and uterus into the fallopian tube. While falloposcopy promises to be a valuable tool for predicting the success of
tubal repairs, it has not yet been proven cost effective in the management of tubal infertility. 
<P>

<CENTER>
<B>Tubal Surgery: the Laparotomy</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>When to Perform a Laparotomy</B>
<P>
I will recommend abdominal surgery (laparotomy) to restore fertility
if with the HSG and laparoscopy I discover:
<UL>
<LI>Removal of large uterine leimyoma (fibroids) deep within the uterine muscle
<LI>Fallopian tube reanastomosis after tubal sterilization
<LI>Extensive and/or large endometrial implants of the bowel that cannot be
treated laparoscopically</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>Purpose of the Laparotomy</B>
<P>
Abdominal surgery affords me the access I need to perform delicate microscopic surgical procedures such as tubal reanastomosis with greater
success. While many cases of endometriosis of the bowel may be handled by endoscopic resection, laparotomy may be necessary to handle the difficult case. Laparoscopic suturing techniques have been developed that allow us to sew without opening the abdomen. Yet, I believe that for the those patients with multiple fibroid tumors or those with fibroid deep within the wall of the uterus, a laparotomy will provide a better repair.<P>
<B>Procedures Used During Laparotomy</B>
<P>
After you're anesthetized (either by going to sleep or with an epidural block), the surgeon will usually make a small bikini
cut (side to side above your pubic bone) through your abdominal
wall to expose your pelvic organs for inspection and repair. Depending
on your fertility problem, a number of corrective procedures may
be performed:
<P>
<I><B>Tubocornual Anastomosis (removing tubal blockage and reconnecting
the tube to the uterus)</B></I>
<P>
When the tubal blockage occurs near the uterus, I can cut out
the bad portion of the tube and reconnect the good end to the
uterus, with the aid of an operating microscope. I shave away
the layers of the uterus over the tubal opening, align the opening
with the tube, and suture the end of the tube to the uterus. At present, in vitro fertilization would appear to provide better pregnancy rates at lower cost in most cases.
<P>
<I><B>Tubotubal Anastomosis (removing a diseased portion of the
tube and reconnecting the ends; sterilization reversal)</B></I>
<P>
Sometimes repeated infection will block the fluid-filled tube.
Removing the blocked portion may restore function to the tube.
If it hasn't been stretched too far out of shape, I can remove
a section of the tube and reconnect the ends to form a functional
passage. The best results occur when the two ends of the tube
are similar in size and when the remaining portion exceeds three
inches in length. This procedure will restore fertility to half
of the women treated. 
<P>
Sterilization reversals are far more successful than corrective
surgery for damage from infection: 60 percent or more will become
pregnant after the surgery. This indicates to me that infection
often impairs the tubal lining to the point that restoring patency
does not restore tubal function. The best success with this procedure
has been achieved by skilled microsurgeons using operating microscopes. While laparoscopic techniques are being tested to replace this procedure, as yet they have not duplicated the results of laparotomy tubal reanastomosis.          
<P>
<B>Recovery From the Laparotomy</B>
<P>
When an epidural anesthetic and IV sedation are used along with local anesthesia at the incision sites, post operative discomfort can be minimized. While most women choose to remain in the hospital overnight or two to three days, many patients have returned home on the day of surgery. Recovery should require three to five days of rest at home or in the hospital and three to
four weeks of restricted activity:
<UL>
<LI>No driving for two weeks
<LI>No intercourse for two to four weeks
<LI>No heavy activity or lifting for four to six weeks
<LI>Absence from work for two to four weeks
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>Potential Complications from the Laparotomy</B>
<P>
As with any surgical procedure there is always a slight chance
for adverse reactions to the anesthesia and medications; and for
postoperative infection.
<P>
<B>The Key to Successful Fertility Surgery: Preventing Adhesions
from Re-forming</B>
<P>
The key to successful fertility surgery is minimizing the damage
from infection, from the organs drying out, and from bleeding.
Microsurgical techniques cause the least amount of damage, since
the specially coated instruments are small and delicate. By using
microsurgery we can control bleeding and blood clotting, which
may start the formation of new adhesions. We can also use fine bipolarcautery
needles to selectively excise small areas of tissue-endometrial
implants, for example-and to stop the bleeding from
very tiny blood vessels. Special solutions are used during surgery
to keep the organs from drying out. 

Before completing the surgical procedure, the raw surfaces are often covered with a adhesion barrier membrane to prevent the re-formation of adhesions (Interceed, Goretex). Alternatively, some physicians will place fluid inside the abdomen to float the internal organs and prevent raw surfaces from sticking together.

<B>Second-Look Laparoscopy</B>
<P>
Some physicians will perform a second-look procedure one to six weeks after the
surgery. If filmy adhesions
are re-formed, the physician can clean them out at that time. As microlaparoscopy under local anesthesia is far less costly than standart laparoscopy, second-look procedures may be more frequently performed as equipment becomes available.<P>

I often perform an HSG six weeks to six months after the surgery to demonstrate
tubal patency. Depending on the nature of the surgery and the
woman's age, I may recommend in vitro fertilization if pregnancy has
not occurred within six months to one year.<HR>

<P>
<I><B>Repeat Tubal Surgery</B></I>
<P>
Tubal surgery costs between $7,000 and $13,000, exposes you to
the pain and risks of major abdominal surgery, and may cause you
to miss up to six weeks of work. In addition, it may be up to
two years before you know if tubal surgery is a success or failure.
Experience shows that success rates for repeat tubal surgery are
fairly poor. A repeat salpingostomy, for example, has a poorer
success rate (less than 10 percent) than in vitro fertilization.
The primary difficulty you may have with choosing between tubal
surgery and in vitro is that your insurance will pay for tubal
surgery, whereas it often won't pay
for in vitro procedures, which cost up to $8-10,000 per cycle.
<P>
Although in vitro procedures may require traveling to distant
clinics and more doctor visits, they expose you to fewer risks
than repeat surgery and have a greater chance of success. In addition,
within a short time you will know if in vitro will work, whereas
with surgery it may take up to two years to find out. While the risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher after tubal surgery, multiple pregnancies are higher after in vitro fertilization.<P>
<B>Margaret B.'s Story</B>
<P>
Margaret B. suffered a ruptured appendix when she was eighteen
years old. She was in the hospital for three weeks and nearly
died. At twenty-four she had a PID infection which did not require
hospitalization. She'd always been concerned that these infections
(peritonitis) could have affected her fertility, but her doctors
would never confirm her suspicion.
<P>
&quot;At thirty I went off the Pill, and my periods resumed in
three months. After six months of trying to get pregnant we became
concerned and consulted Dr. Perloe&quot; Margaret said.
<P>
<img align="right" src="adhes2.gif">&quot;When he did my laparoscopy, he found I had adhesions so
thick that he could barely see anything else. During my surgery he found that my right tube was blocked
and the fimbria had deteriorated. Although he attempted to repair
the tube, he was doubtful that it would work. My left tube, however,
was in good shape once he removed the pelvic adhesions from around
it. After the surgery he told me I had a fifty-fifty chance of
getting pregnant.
<P>
&quot;I returned home within hours of my surgery. Dr. Perloe
told me to stay home; and not to vacuum, pick up grocery sacks,
or do any heavy work. After a week or two, he said, I could return
to work.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Three months after my surgery Dr. Perloe repeated my tubal
X ray. That's when we got the bad news: both of my tubes had blocked
up with adhesions. My husband and I didn't want to go through
another laparotomy, so we decided to try in vitro.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I'm happy to report that our second in vitro try was successful!
Jon was born last month.&quot;
