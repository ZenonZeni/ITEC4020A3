                       Recommendation No. R (95) 13<br>
<p>
               of the Committee of Ministers to Member States<br>
<p>
                Concerning Problems of Criminal Procedure Law<br>
                    Connected with Information Technology<br>
<p>
       (Adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 September 1995<br>
                at the 543 meeting of the Ministers' Deputies)<br>
<p>
        The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 15.b of the<br>
Statute of the Council of Europe.<br>
<p>
        Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a<br>
greater unity between its members;<br>
<p>
        Having regard to the unprecedented development of information<br>
technology and its application in all sectors of modern society;<br>
<p>
        Realizing that the development of electronic information systems<br>
will speed up the transformation of traditional society into an<br>
information society by creating a new space for all types of<br>
communications and relations;<br>
<p>
        Aware of the impact of information technology on the manner in<br>
which society is organised and on how individuals communications and<br>
interrelate;<br>
<p>
        Conscious that an increasing part of economic and social relations<br>
will take place through or by use of electronic information systems;<br>
<p>
        Concerned at the risk that electronic information systems and<br>
electronic information may also be used for committing criminal offenses;<br>
<p>
        Considering that evidence of criminal offenses may be stored and<br>
transferred by these systems;<br>
<p>
        Noting that criminal procedure laws of members states often do not<br>
yet provide for appropriate powers to search and collect evidence in these<br>
systems in the course of criminal investigations;<br>
<p>
        Recalling that the lack of appropriate special powers may impair<br>
investigating authorities in the proper fufilment of their tasks in the<br>
face of the ongoing development of information technology;<br>
<p>
        Recognising the need to adopt the legitimate tools which<br>
investigating authorities are afforded under criminal procedure laws the<br>
the specific nature of investigations in electronic information systems;<br>
<p>
        Concerned by the potential risk that member states may not be able<br>
to render mutual legal assistance in an appropriate way when requested to<br>
collect electronic evidence within their territory from electronic<br>
information systems;<br>
<p>
        Convinced of the necessity of strengthening internation<br>
co-operation and achieving a greater compatibility of criminal procedural<br>
laws in this field;<br>
<p>
        Recalling Recommendation No. R (81) 20 of the Committee of<br>
Ministers on the harmonisation of laws relating to the requirement of<br>
written proof and to the admissibility of reproductions of documents and<br>
recordings on computers, Recommendation No. R. (85) 10 on letters rogatory<br>
for the interception of telecommunications, Recommendations No. R (87) 15<br>
regulating the use of personal data in the police state and<br>
Recommendations No. R (89) 9 on computer-relating crime,<br>
<p>
        Recommends the governments of member states:<br>
<p>
i.      when reviewing their internal legislation and practice, to be<br>
guided by the principles appended to this recommendation; and<br>
<p>
ii.     to ensure publicity for these principles among those investigating<br>
authorities and other professional bodies, in particular in the field of<br>
information technology, which may have an interest in their application.<br>
<p>
<p>
                Appendix to Recommendation No R. (95) 13<br>
<p>
               concerning problems of criminal procedure law<br>
                   connected with information technology<br>
<p>
I. Search and seizure<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<p>
1. The legal distinction between searching computers systems and siezing<br>
data stored therein and intercepting data in the course of transmission<br>
should be clearly delineated and applied.<br>
<p>
2. Criminal procedure laws should permit investigating authorities to<br>
search computer systems and seize data under similar conditions as under<br>
traditional powers of search and seizure. The person in charge of the<br>
system should be informed that the system has been searched and of the<br>
kind of data that has been siezed. The legal remedies that are provided<br>
for in general against search and seizure should be equally applicable in<br>
case of search in computer systems and in case of seizure of data therein.<br>
<p>
3. During execution of a search, investigating authorities should have the<br>
power, subject to appropriate safeguards, to extend the search of other<br>
computer systems within their jurisdiction which are connected by menas of<br>
a network and seize the data therein, provided immediate action is<br>
required.<br>
<p>
4. Where automatically processed data is functionally equivalent to a<br>
traditional document, provisions in the criminal procedure law relating to<br>
search and seizure of documents should apply equally to it.<br>
<p>
II. Technical Surveillance<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
5. in view of the convergance of information technology and<br>
telecommunications, law pertaining to technical surveillance for the<br>
purpose of criminal investigations, such as interception of<br>
telecommunications, should be reviewed and amended, where necessary, to<br>
ensure their applicability.<br>
<p>
6. The law should permit investigating authorities to avail themselves of<br>
all necessary technical measures that enable the collection of traffic<br>
data in the investigation of crimes.<br>
<p>
7. When collected in the course of a criminal investigation and in<br>
particular when obtained by means of intercepting telecommunications, data<br>
which is the object of legal protection and processed by a compuer system<br>
should be secured in an appropriate manner.<br>
<p>
8. Criminal procedure laws should be reviewed with a view to making<br>
possible the interception of telecommunications and the collection of<br>
traffic data in the investigation of serious offenses against the<br>
confidentiality, integrity and availability of telecommunications or<br>
computer systems.<br>
<p>
<p>
III. Obligations to co-operate with the investigating authorities<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
9. Subject to legal privileges or protection, most legal systems permit<br>
investigating authorities to order persons to hand over objects under<br>
their control that are required to serve as evidence. In a parallel<br>
fashion, provisions should be made for the power to order persons to<br>
submit any specified data under their control in a computer system in the<br>
form required by the investigating authority.<br>
<p>
10. Subject to legal privileges or protection, investigating authorities<br>
should have the power to order persons who have data in a computer system<br>
under their control to provide all necessary information to enable access<br>
to a computer system and the data theirin. Criminal procedure law should<br>
ensure that a similar order can be given to other persons who have<br>
knowledge about the functioning of the computer system or measures applied<br>
to secure the data therein.<br>
<p>
11. Specific obligations should be imposed on operators of public and<br>
private networks that offer telecommunications services to the public to<br>
avail themselves of all necessary technical measures that enable the<br>
interception of telecommunications by the investigating authorities.<br>
<p>
12. Specific obligations should be imposed on service providers who offer<br>
telecommunications services to the public, either through public or<br>
private networks, to provide information to identify the user, when so<br>
ordered by the compentant investigating authority.<br>
<p>
<p>
IV. Electronic Evidence<br>
------------------------<br>
<p>
13. The common need to collect, preserve, and present electronic evidence<br>
in ways that best ensure and reflect their integrity and irrefutable<br>
authenticity, both for the purposes of domestic prosecution and<br>
international co-operation, should be recognized. Therefore, procedures<br>
and technical methods for handling electronic evidence should be further<br>
developed, and particularly in such a way as to ensure their compatability<br>
between states. Criminal procedural law provisions on evidence relating to<br>
tradition documents should similarly apply to data stored in a computer<br>
system.<br>
<p>
<p>
V. Use of Encryption<br>
---------------------<br>
<p>
14. Measures should be considered to minimise the negative effects of the<br>
use of cryptography on the investigation of criminal offenses, without<br>
affecting its legitimate use more than is strictly necessary.<br>
<p>
<p>
VI. Research, statistics and training<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<p>
15. The risks involved in the development and application of information<br>
technology with regard to the commission of criminal offenses should be<br>
assured continuously. In order to enable the competent authorities to keep<br>
abrest of new phenomena in the field of computer related offenses and to<br>
develop appropriate counter-measures, the collection and analysis of data<br>
on these offenses, including modus operandi and technical apsects, should<br>
be furthered.<br>
<p>
16. The establishment of specialised units for the investigation of<br>
offenses, the combating of which requires special expertise in information<br>
technology, should be considered. Training programmes enabling criminal<br>
justice personnel to avail themselves of expertise in this field should be<br>
furthered.<br>
<p>
<p>
VII. International Cooperation<br>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
17. The power to extend a search to other computer systems should also be<br>
applicable when the system is located in a foreign jurisdiction, provided<br>
that immediate action is required. In order to avoid possible violations<br>
of state sovereignity or international law, an unambigious legal basis for<br>
such extended search and seizure should be established. Therefore, there<br>
is an urgent need for negotiating international agreements as to how, when<br>
and to what extent such search and seizure should be permitted.<br>
<p>
18. Expedited and adequate procedures as well as a system of liason should<br>
be available according to which the investigating authorities may request<br>
the foreign authorities to promptly collect evidence.  For that purpose<br>
the requested authorities should be authorized to search a computer system<br>
and seize data with a view to its subsequent transfer.  The requested<br>
authorities should also be authorized to provide trafficking data rtelated<br>
to a specific telecommunication, intercept a specific telecommunication or<br>
identify its source. For that purpose, the existing mutual legal<br>
assistance instruments need to be supplemented.<br>
