<h2 align=center><i> (Serophene, Clomid) </i></h2>
Clomiphene is often referred to as the "fertility pill".  It is used to treat infertile women who have an ovulation problem.  It works by helping your pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain) improve the stimulation of developing follicles (eggs) in the ovaries.  Clomiphene may not help a woman become more fertile if she is already ovulating normally.  For that reason, clomiphene is most often prescribed to those patients who have been found to have an abnormality with their cycle.<p>
Clomiphene is usually prescribed for five days each cycle, usually beginning on day three and continuing through day seven.  The usual initial dose is one tablet daily.  The number of tablets can be increased to as many as four daily if a lesser dosage does not result in ovulation, but rarely are more than two tablets required.  Clomiphene only works for the cycle in which it is taken.  Clomiphene should be repeated each cycle until pregnancy occurs, or your doctor discontinues it. <p>
Of all women treated with clomiphene 60% to 80% will ovulate normally.  However, only half of those patients who ovulate will become pregnant.  It is not known why only half of the women who apparently ovulate with clomiphene therapy become pregnant.  It is suspected that factors other than inadequate ovulation may be contributing to the fertility problem.  Therefore, if you are not pregnant after three or four cycles, additional testing such as a post-coital test, endometrial biopsy or hysterosalpingogram may be necessary.  If tests reveal normal ovulation, a total of four to six cycles of clomiphene therapy is recommended. <p>
Some 10% to 20% of women taking clomiphene will experience side effects.  By far, most of these are minor and temporary in nature. They include such things as hot flashes, blurred vision, nausea, bloating sensation, and headache.  Serious side effects are rarely seen with clomiphene therapy.  There are two side effects associated with clomiphene therapy that warrant specific discussion.  The first is the possibility of multiple pregnancy. The frequency of twins occurring in women who conceive while taking clomiphene has been reported to be as high as 10%.  Triplets may occur as frequently as 1 in 400 births, and quadruplets in 1 in 800 births. Clomiphene is not the "fertility drug" you may have heard in the news bulletins often associated with large numbers of infants, such as quintuplets. Newer studies suggest that long-term use of clomiphene for more than 12 cycles may place you at an increased risk of developing <a href="ovca.html">ovarian cancer</a>.<p>
Clomiphene has also been associated with the occasional development of ovarian cysts.  These  cysts are not true growths of the ovary and within a few weeks will resolve without treatment.  However, on an extremely rare occasion, these cysts have been known to cause internal bleeding or twist, requiring surgery and removal of the involved ovary.  I must again emphasize, however, that such a complication is extremely rare. <p>
Clomiphene stimulated cycles are not unlike normal cycles in that there is only a 20-25% chance of conception occurring each cycle, even if the medication is working properly.  This means that at least four to six cycles of treatment are necessary before one has given clomiphene an adequate trial. <p>
Recent studies indicate that if a pregnancy occurs as a result of the clomiphene treatment, there is no clinically significant increased risk of miscarriage or congenital birth defects when compared to other infertile couples who conceived without clomiphene treatment. <P>
<h2>CLOMIPHENE PROTOCOL at ARHC </h2> 
At the onset of menstrual flow, before day three, you need to be seen for a "clomiphene check".  A clomiphene check will be required each month prior to prescribing the medication.  The clomiphene check allows us to review your previous treatment cycle and a pelvic exam or ultrasound ensures that the clomiphene has not stimulated the development of an enlarged ovarian cyst. <p>
If your exam is normal and the clomiphene is working properly, it will again be prescribed to start on day  three of your cycle. If either you or your physician feel that you might be pregnant, do not take clomiphene as there may be a possibility of increased risk of congenital defects.<i>  IF YOU THINK YOU MAY BE PREGNANT, DO NOT TAKE CLOMIPHENE.  NOTIFY YOUR PHYSICIAN</i>!  <p>
You will begin by taking a single clomiphene 50mg tablet daily from the third through the seventh day. Two or three days later I will do a bloodtest to check both LH and FSH levels.  If the LH is three times the FSH level, then you most likely have sever polycystic ovarian disease and clomiphene is unlikely to work for you. <p>
On cycle day 11 or 12 you will begin daily urine testing to detect an LH surge, the signal that ovulation will occur within 24-36 hours.  When the surge occurs on the 11th or 12th cycle day, an ultrasound is done to confirm that you have developed a normal follicle and that the uterine lining is ready.  If you do not have a surge by the 16-18th cycle day an ultrasound is done to check for follicular development and measure the thickness of the uterine lining.  If things are ready (follicle>19mm and endometrium>7mm) an hCG injection is given to trigger release of egg(s).  If things are almost ready, you can continue checking your urine and give hCG in 1-2 days.  If follicular development is good but the uterine lining has not yet developed, an estrogen level will be checked.  If follicular development is poor, the cycle will be canceled and next month a larger dose will be administered.<p>
More than half the clomiphene pregnancies occur during the first three cycles and more than 3/4 occur at the 50mg. dose.  Rarely, will pregnancy occur when more than 100mg/day (two tablets) are necessary.  If you have not conceived after three cycles, intrauterine insemination will be recommended to improve your chances of conceiving.  If you have not conceived after four to six cycles, either combined clomiphene/metrodin/insemination or <a HREF="sproviui.html">Pergonal/Humegon/Metrodin/Insemination</a> will be recommended.<p>
