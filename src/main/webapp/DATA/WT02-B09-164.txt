<h1 align=center>Proposition 215 Gaining
<br>in Latest Statewide <i>L.A. Times</i> Poll</h1>

<h2 align=center>Support Increases Five Percent in Month</h2>

<p>F<b>rom the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> -- October 25, 1996</b></p>

<p>Unlike Proposition 209, Proposition 215--the medical use of marijuana
initiative-is enjoying increasing support as the election draws near. Currently,
when given the ballot description, 58% of likely voters support Proposition
215 while 32% oppose it. In September, 53% of likely voters supported the
measure and 31% opposed it. </p>

<p>The medical use of marijuana initiative enjoys electoral support that
is both wide and deep. Substantial majorities of almost all electoral groups
in the poll support the measure. Even California's oldest voters (65 years
and older) and Republican voters support the measure by slim pluralities,
while conservatives are evenly split over the initiative: 45% in favor
and 46% opposed. </p>

<p>This measure is also the most well-known of the propositions included
in the poll, with only 22% of voters saying they had not heard enough about
the initiative to express an initial opinion. </p>

<p>The survey was conducted October 17th through 21st among 1,551 adult
respondents throughout the state, including 1,290 registered voters from
which 1,038 likely voters were determined. The survey was conducted October
