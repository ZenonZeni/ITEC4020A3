<TITLE> Marijuana Has No Medical Use </TITLE>
<CENTER>
<H3>MARIJUANA HAS NO CURRENTLY ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE
</H3></CENTER>

Relying on the same scientific standards used to judge all other drugs, FDA
experts repeatedly rejected marijuana for medicinal use.  
<P>
Is marijuana good medicine for illnesses we all fear?  The answer might seem obvious based simply on common sense.  Smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases. Americans take their medications in many different forms, but never by smoking.  No medicine prescribed for us today is smoked.
<P>
<DL>
<DT>*  Marijuana's chemistry is neither fully known, nor reproducible.
<DT>*  Adequate safety studies have not been done.
<DT>*  There are no adequate, well-controlled scientific studies proving
marijuana is effective for anything.
<DT>*  Marijuana is not accepted for medical use in treatment by even a
respectable minority.
<DT>*  The published scientific evidence is not adequate to permit experts to
fairly and responsibly conclude that marijuana is safe and effective for use in humans.
</DL>
<P>
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the claims that marijuana is medicine are false
and dangerous.  It is a cruel hoax to offer false hope to desperately ill
people.  Sick people can be fooled by false claims and waste precious time
experimenting with marijuana while neglecting approved medications for their specific illness.
<P>
Not one American health association accepts marijuana as a medicine.
<DL>
<DT>*  Not the American Medical Association
<DT>*  Not the National Multiple Sclerosis Society
<DT>*  Not the American Glaucoma Society
<DT>*  Not the American Academy of Ophthalmology
<DT>*  Not the American Cancer Society

</DL>
There are over 10,000 documented scientific research papers on file at the
University of Mississippi, and not one gives marijuana a clean bill of
health.  By any modern standard, marijuana is no medicine.
<P>
Using lay testimonials, impressions of physicians, isolated case studies,
random clinical experience, reports so lacking in details they cannot be
scientifically evaluated, anecdotal proof, and statistically flawed studies,
pro drug legalization advocates have sought to establish credibility through
the medical marijuana issue.
<P>
Unfortunately, many who have limited or no medical background and politicians with little time to learn the issue have been influenced by the drug culture statements presented by the media.  In many cases, the media has ignored contrary data in thousands of research papers and opinions of highly respected medical researchers.  The result, if not the intent, of this type of irresponsible reporting is that society is being misled with an untrue and very dangerous message.
