<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>ALLERGIES</CENTER></H3>

The 38 year old man in this case was a walking allergic disaster. He had peptic ulcers,
chronic constipation and flatulence; he was hyperactive as a child but lethargic as an
adult; and he had excessive exposure to toxic chemicals and had taken a great deal of
antibiotics. His body itched all over from eczema. Allergy shots only made him feel
worse. He was easily irritated, shouted a lot, and felt little self-confidence.

<P>It took 2 different remedies to help him. First his homeopath gave him Lycopodium, which
is made from Club Moss, and this improved his energy, digestion, and moods for  several
months. Then he had several doses of Theridion, made from the venom of the orange spider,
and this cleared up nearly all his symptoms.


<P>This relatively fast improvement is remarkable considering how many layers of physical
and emotional illness this man was living with.

<P><A NAME="GINGKO"> </A>
<HR><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>ALZHEIMER'S</CENTER></H3>


<P>The popular herb Gingko biloba can help keep mental abilities intact in the early stages
of Alzheimer's.  Patients who had been diagnosed as having senile dementia took 80 mg of
Gingko biloba extract 3 times daily for 3 months; they showed marked improvements in
memory and attention, as  well as mind and body coordination.


<P>Ginkgo is gaining a reputation for success in the early stages of senile dementia as a
way of slowing down its development and improving the quality of life among the afflicted
elderly.  Not only is Gingko now proven to be useful in slowing down the development of
Alzheimer's but it is generally recognized as a brain power-building herb that can
enhance mental abilities in healthy adults. In some people, a high dosage can produce
brief headaches or dizziness; if this happens, start lower at 120 mg daily then climb to
240 mg daily over a period of 6-8 weeks.

<P><A NAME="ANXIETY"> </A>
<HR><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>ANXIETY</CENTER></H3>


<P>Valerian root, used in combination with either lemon balm or passion flower, is a safe
and effective  way to reduce general anxiety or to withdraw from anti-anxiety
medications. One study, based on measuring brain wave activity, showed that a combination
of valerian root (100 mg) and passion flower (45 mg) taken 6 times daily lowered the
brain waves of patients into a more relaxed zone (called alpha and theta) in only 2 weeks
compared to the conventional medications that took 6 weeks.


<P>Used on its own, valerian is one of the best nervine herbs for treating problems with the
nervous system, stress conditions, pain, and childhood behavioral disorders. A study of
120 children who exhibited a wide range of behavioral problems showed that after taking
valerian for only 3 weeks, 75% showed a marked improvement. Recommended dosage for
extract  is 10-20 drops mixed with water, taken 3 times daily. For children, ages 7-14,
use half this amount.

<P><HR><A NAME="MUSIC"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>ATHSMA</CENTER></H3>


<P>Playing and listening to music may be the newest way to successfully treat asthma. A man,
age 33, had been suffering from bronchial asthma for seven years. He had frequent
asthmatic attacks, especially when he was exposed to cold weather, and it would take him
months to recover. He had tried all sorts of therapies, including antibiotics, massage,
diet, aromatherapy baths, but nothing helped him. Finally he turned to  music therapy as
practiced in anthroposophic therapy.


<P>For 30 minutes once a week, he worked with a music therapist, alternating between
listening to music and playing it. His therapist played live music for him, using wind 
or string instruments and percussion-but she played it to his back while he listened
attentively. The idea is that the live flow of pure musical sounds worked therapeutically
on his chest and back and thus on his breathing. He also learned to play a copper flute
which demanded a special breathing technique. Both approaches improved his breathing and
reduced stress.


<P>After only a few sessions, he felt more relaxed, his breathing had eased up, and his
sense of well-being increased. After 6 months he told his therapist that music therapy
was the only approach that had given him good results.  During the 18 months of music
therapy, he didn't have a single asthma attack, nor did he have any in the years
following.

<P><A NAME="ATHLETES"> </A>
<HR><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>ATHLETE'S FOOT</CENTER></H3>


<P>Mark, age 22, had lived with athlete's foot for about 3 years when he met up with an
aromatherapist.


<P>This was the prescription: do footbaths twice daily with 8-10 drops of tea tree oil in a
large basin of water; put a tea tree oil compress on the most afflicted toes at night;
apply an aqueous cream  made of 15 drops of tea tree oil to 50 g of body cream; wear only
cotton socks and change them every day; put 6-8 drops of tea tree oil in your bath water
every night; and wash hands regularly in a basin of water to which 3 drops of tea  tree
oil have been added. It worked.


<P>Within 1 week,  the infection on one foot was nearly cleared up and the other foot showed
great progress. Within a month, or after Mark's fourth aromatherapy session, his
athlete's foot condition was history.

<P><A NAME="CANC"> </A>
<HR><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>CANCER</CENTER></H3>


<P>Ever since 1920, European M.D.s have been using mistletoe to successfuly extend the lives
of cancer patients. Originally conceived by Austrian scientist Rudolf Steiner, the
therapeutic success of mistletoe-better known by its trademarked name, Iscador-has now
been reported in over 4600 case studies.  Iscador (which is injected as a serum) both
inhibits the growth of malignant cancer cells and often actually destroys them. If
anything, it is the fabled &quot;magic bullet&quot; so passionately sought after by conventional
medicine.


<P>After more than 70 years of continuous use,  the effectiveness of Iscador in cancer
treatment is generally considered well proven in Europe. Even so, it's still not licensed
by the FDA for use in the U.S.


<P>There is no argument that Iscador definitely gives the cancer patient more months, even
years, of life, ranging from 4 to 44 months depending on the type of cancer.


<P>With breast cancer, one study showed that more of 319 patients treated with Iscador were
alive after 10 years than 228 patients who had no Iscador. Those with cervical cancer who
had a combination of surgery, Iscador, and radiation therapy showed an 83% survival rate
after 5 years compared to a 69% survival rate for those who had radiation alone.


<P>Iscador seems to block the development of bladder papillomas into malignant tumors.
Normally 50% of these become malignant in 3 years, but  with Iscador, only 3 out of 14
did.


<P>Of patients with bronchial cancer, 75% of those under Iscador treatment were still alive
after 4 years compared to only 35% of those without Iscador. With skin cancer, the
survival rate after 3 years for those on Iscador was 80% compared to 65% for those
without it. Iscador gets its best results with solid tumors that do not respond well to
chemotherapy or radiation, but it does not do well against leukemia or acute lymph node
cancers.


<P>Mistletoe, or Iscador, is available in the U.S. for use by qualified health care
practitioners in the form of Viscum Compositum (as liquid for oral use) from BHI, Inc.,

<HR><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>MENSTRUATION</CENTER></H3>


<P>Here's how to  reduce your discomfort during PMS and menstruation, according to Ayurvedic
physicians Nancy Lonsdorf, M.D., and Veronica Butler, M.D.


<P>First day, have a liquid diet (blended soups, juices) to aid digestion. Avoid eggs and
fermented, spicy, or sour  foods. Budget time for resting. Reduce your exercise schedule.
Spend some time turning inward. Eat foods that are warm and easy to digest. Avoid
carbonated  beverages and cold drinks. Eat less than usual, especially in the evening.
Avoid cheese, yogurt, red meat, fried foods, chocolate. If you crave salt, satisfy the
desire minimally, but try to resist the sugar craving or find natural substitutes such as
whipped cream with honey rather than ice cream. Take a hot shower rather than bath.

<HR><H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>WEIGHT LOSS</CENTER></H3>


<P>A combination of 3 herbs from classical Indian, or Ayurvedic, herbalism can produce good 
results in a weight loss program.


<P>In one study, 48 obese people used 1 of 3 Ayurvedic herbal mixtures, including Triphala
guggul, Gokshuradi guggul, or Sinhanad guggul, taking them 3 times daily for 3 months.
Their average weight loss was 8 kg compared to only 2 kg in a group taking a placebo.
They experienced no loss of appetite or changes in blood pressure (although 20%
experienced some diarrhea), and many saw a lowering of their blood cholesterol levels.
