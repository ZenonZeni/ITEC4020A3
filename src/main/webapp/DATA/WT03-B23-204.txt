<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What you say CAN hurt you. &nbsp;This is what we advise
our clients to say when confronted by a police officer.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=-1>"Officer, please understand I refuse to talk
with you
until I consult with my attorney. I also refuse to consent to any search
of these premises or any other premises under my control, or in which I have
a possessory, proprietary, or privacy interest, including my car, my body,
or effects. I hereby demand to <B>immediately </B> be allowed the reasonable
opportunity to obtain the advice of my attorney by telephone.</FONT></FONT>
<P> I desire to exercise all my rights guaranteed by the Constitution of
the United States and the State of Washington, to be free from your interference
with my person or affairs.
<P> If you attempt to question me, I want my lawyer present. I refuse to
participate in any line-up or to perform any physical acts, or to speak or
display my person or property at your direction, without first conferring
with my lawyer.
<P> If I am under arrest, I wish to invoke and exercise my <B>Miranda</B>
  rights. If you ignore my exercise of these rights and attempt to procure
a waiver, I want to confer with my lawyer prior to any conversations with
you.
<P> If I am to be taken into custody, removed from my present location, or
separated from my property, I request a reasonable opportunity to make
arrangements to secure my own property. I do not consent to any impoundment
or inventory of my property. I do, hereby, waive any claim of liability for
loss, theft or damage against you, your superiors, or any other authority,
and agree to hold all harmless therefrom, if I am afforded the reasonable
opportunity to arrange for the safekeeping of my own property. If this reasonable
opportunity is denied or is unavailable, I demand that only such intrusion
occur as is minimally necessary to secure such property, hereby waiving any
claim of liability for your failure to scrutinize the property or its contents
prior to it being secured.
<P> If I am not under arrest, I want to leave. If I am free to leave, please
tell me immediately so that I may go about my business."<BR><BR>We have this
information printed on the back of our business cards for clients to carry
with them and read to any officer who stops them or otherwise interferes
with their activities. <HR NOSHADE>
