<H2><CENTER>Marijuana absent in 1993 scientific review of glaucoma treatment
</CENTER>
</H2>
G!aucoma treatment was thoroughly reviewed in the New England Journal of
Medicine, Vol. 328, p. 1103, 1993, by Quigley. Marijuana was not mentioned
in the review of effective medications for treatment of this disorder. For
precise control of the intraocular pressure usually associated with this
disease, frequent monitoring of patients receiving a drug that delivers
uniform doses is necessary. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> Except in rare instances glaucoma is a symptomless
disease until loss of eyesight begins. Most, but not all patients afflicted
with glaucoma, experience increased intraocular pressure which, if left
untreated, will lead to blindness. Since there are many effective medications,
and since doses of marijuana by smoking cannot be controlled, using smoked
marijuana to treat glaucoma is potentially dangerous. <BR>
<BR>
Because the baseline (normal) pressure varies from individual to individual,
this disease and its treatment must be carefully monitored and tailored
to each patient. Though marijuana, like alcohol, can reduce intraocular
pressure, the dose cannot be controlled and risk of damage due to either
excessive or inadequate lowering of pressure could lead to blindness. Further,
the side effects associated with marijuana use, such as impairment of motor
skills, are not present with currently available approved therapies. To
assure the best outcome for this disease, frequent monitoring of patients
receiving a drug that delivers uniform doses is necessary. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Suppository form of Delta 9 THC better than oral form for treating
appetite loss</CENTER>
</H2>
Struwe et al, in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy, vol. 27, pp. 827-831, 1993,
reported a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial with
two 5-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week washout period. Patients
received dronabinol (Marina) 5 mg twice daily before meals, or a placebo.
Twelve HlV-infected patients who had lost at least five pounds participated
in the study. Only five patients were able to complete the protocol because
of various side effects of delta 9 THC. In the subjects who completed the
study, there was no statistically significant weight gain, increased serum
proteins, or improved appetite. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> Smoking marijuana has been alleged to be good
for the loss of appetite seen in AIDS patients. Because inhallation of irritants
(which potentially could be contaminated with fungi) poses a needless and
serious endangerment to the already compromised immune systems of AIDS patients,
this practice would appear risky. <BR>
<BR>
Oral delta 9 THC, the synthetic form of the most active cannabinoid in marijuana,
would seem to be a better choice, but recent research on its efficacy was
disappointing. Thus, in a selected group of HIV infected patients, a controlled
study failed to support any effect of delta 9 THC to increase appetite.
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the recent report by Mattes and associates, in the journal, Pharmacology,
Biochemistry, and Behavior, vol. 44, pp. 745-747, 1993, of a rectal form
of THC which was well-tolerated, would be of benefit. This drug produced
higher and more sustained plasma levels which should enhance its efficacy
as an anti-vomiting drug in chemotherapy and, perhaps, as an appetite stimulant.
This would completely avoid the necessity to have a smoked form of the drug
in which a variable amount of active drug is delivered with each cigarette
and further compromises damaged immune systems. <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana carries serious risk for those under treatment for
mental illness </CENTER>
</H2>
Tardive dyskinesia is a condition in which abnormal involuntary movements
develop, producing serious necrologic disability. Some patients treated
for schizophrenia with drugs such as chlorpromazine, develop this serious
condition as a side effect of therapy. New research published by Zaretsky
in the journal, Schizophrenia Research, Vol. 11, pp. 3-8, 1993, shows that
a major risk factor for development of this complication of neuroleptic
therapy is current or past use of cannabis. A study of 51 chronic neuroleptictreated
outpatients with diagnoses of schizophrenia showed that current use of cannibis
far outdistanced any other risk factor such as cigarette smoking, caffeine,
or alcohol use. The authors concluded that even &quot;recreational&quot;
use of marijuana or hashish in patients treated with these drugs was dangerous
. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> This study adds to the current literature confirming
that up to 60% of schizophrenic patients use non-prescription psychoactive
drugs. O <BR>
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana components damage the ability of human immune cells
to function. </CENTER>
</H2>
Recent work by Watzl et al, Drugs of Abuse Immunity and Immunodeficiency,
1991, and Djeu et al, published in the same journal, showed that the major
psychoactive component of marijuana, delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
is able to interfere with the function of white blood cells taken from humans.
Both neutrophils, which fight bacterial infection, and mononuclear cells
of the immune system, which fight viruses, were suppressed by various concentrations
of THC. <BR>
<BR>
Schwartz, in the Journal of Hospital and Community Psychiatry, Vol. 38,
p. 531, May 1987, pointed out that marijuana use is a factor in preparing
the ground for HIV infection and that in the list of risk-reducing behaviors
for patients with HIV, a significant preventative step might be to discourage
the use of marijuana among those at risk. <BR>
<BR>
It is of interest, as pointed out by Pillia, in the Archives of Toxicology,
Vol. 65, pp. 609-617, 1991, that drugs of abuse, as well as alcohol, have
immunotoxic properties which include marked changes in the cellular, humoral,
and other components of the immune defense mechanism. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary: </STRONG>Applying this work to human beings would suggest
that marijuana smoke would depress those immune cells which protect the
body from viral or bacterial infections. This would be particularly dangerous
in patients with already compromised immune systems, such as those with
AIDS. <BR>
<BR>
Thus, since a large majority of people with AIDS have a well-established
history of drug and alcohol abuse, Such a compromise of the immune system
can render the body more susceptible to the development of AIDS after HIV
infection. <BR>
