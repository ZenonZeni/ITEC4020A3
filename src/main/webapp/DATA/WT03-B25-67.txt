</CENTER><P>With the move away from solvent cleaners and the growing use  of 
aqueous cleaners, many companies have encountered problems with cleaner 
chemistries not operating at desired performance levels. Often, much time 
and money are spent determining the chemistry, temperature, cycle time, pH 
and additives for the cleaner bath, all to ensure proper parts cleaning. These 
are important considerations, yet without proper filtration, agitation and 
oil removal, attention to these details will not adequately maintain 
cleaner solutions.
<P>A fresh cleaner bath operating at the proper temperature, with all 
other conditions perfect, will do an excellent job on the first batch of 
work. However, as more parts are cleaned, they deposit particulates and 
organic matter that render the cleaning solution less effective. As the solution 
becomes loaded with contaminants, no adjustment in chemistry, 
temperature, cycle time, pH or additives will adequately maintain cleaner 
performance. The most efficient and effective way to maintain the cleaner solution is 
to remove dirt and oils when they are introduced. 
<P>The first maintenance method is filtration. There are a variety of 
filtration technologies available, including bag, disc, cartridge and automatic 
filtration. Important factors that influence the type of filtration selected 
typically are cost and floor space available. 
<P>For light dirt-loading applications, bag and disc filtration may be 
adequate. Bag and disc filtration are surface loading and therefore the 
volume of the filter chamber is relatively large, so equipment will take up more 
floor space than a depth-cartridge unit of the same capacity. 
<P>Automatic filtration systems, such as indexing fabric filters or 
permanent-media backwash systems, are also available for cleaner solutions. 
Automatic systems typically require a higher initial expenditure and more floor 
space, yet payback is achieved more quickly because less labor is required 
to maintain the equipment. 

<P>Bag, disc and automatic backwash filters may be more economical 
downstream on plating or final process solutions, since the amount of dirt 
removed should be less than in a cleaner bath. Spent media from cleaners 
is typically non-hazardous. Trapping most of the dirt in the 
non-hazardous area minimizes dirt going downstream to potentially more hazardous 
solutions where disposal of the spent media could be a major concern. 
<P>Often, the most economical and effective means of cleaner filtration is 
a depth filter cartridge. The depth filter cartridge consists of a rigid 
one-inch ID core (typically polypropylene) with fiber string continuously 
wound around the core. The result is a diamond pattern &quot;crisscross&quot; media 
with larger holes or pores on the outer diameter becoming increasingly 
smaller toward the inner diameter or core. The amount of fiber wrapped on the 
core and the tension of the winding determine the cartridge's micron rating. 
<P>Lower micron cartridges are wound tighter, use more fiber, have 
smaller pore sizes and usually cost more than coarse cartridge media. In 
addition, finer micron cartridges do not hold as much dirt, fill with particulate 
more quickly and require more frequent changing. Higher micron or coarse 
cartridges use less fiber, are less tightly wound and cost less. A coarse filter cartridge 
with larger pores will initially pass larger particles. However, as the pore loads 
with particulates, the particulates serve as media, 
lowering the pore size and allowing filtration of smaller and smaller particles. 
<P>Cleaner baths often contain a range of particle sizes and a large amount 
of particulates. The advantage to using coarse cartridge media on cleaners 
is that their greater dirt-holding capacity makes them more appropriate for 
the range of particulate sizes found in dirt-laden cleaner solutions. As 
larger particulates load the filter's pores, the pores become smaller and trap 
particulates finer than the filter's micron rating. 
<P>To maintain solution at a certain level of clarity, cartridges as low as 
15, 20 or 30 micron are often specified. However, a 100 micron cartridge 
provides three times the dirt-holding capacity of a 15 micron cartridge. At 
a high solution turnover rate, the cartridge will load with particulates that 
will serve as media. This way the cartridge will filter at lower than the 100 
micron level with minimal reduction in flow. This method provides longer 
high-flow operation between cartridge changeout and higher levels of dirt 
removed on a continuous basis. This translates into reduced maintenance 
costs and fewer, less expensive cartridges used, doubling savings on a vital part 
of the manufacturing process. Since organic matter/oils typically attach 
to fiber and particulate matter, the more particulate matter removed, the 
more residual oil is removed from the solution. 
<P>The cartridge-type filtration system is normally less expensive and 
will require less floor space than other filtration systems of equal and often 
less capacity. Cartridge-type filtration with coarse media provides the 
highest possible dirt-holding capacity in the smallest, most economical 
package when used on cleaner baths. A quality 100 micron, 10-inch cartridge 
holds up to 16 oz of particulate matter. Therefore, a filtration system with 60 
10-inch depth-type filter cartridges of 100 micron porosity will hold up to 60 lbs 
of particulate matter. 
<P>To properly size a cartridge-filtration system, consider flow rate, 
filter surface area and micron retention. First, solution recirculation rates 
should be at least five to 10 turnovers per hr. Higher dirt-loading applications 
will require higher turnover and vice versa for lower dirt loading applications. 
<P>To determine surface area, a common rule of thumb is to provide at 
least three and a half to seven sq ft of surface area capacity per 50 gal of 
solution. One 10-inch filter cartridge will provide three and a half sq ft of filter 
area. One 10-inch cartridge per 50 gal for light dirt loading and a minimum of 
two 10-inch cartridges per 50 gal for higher dirt loading are recommended. As 
an example, a 400 gal cleaner requires a filtration rate of 2,000 to 4,000 gph 
and a filter capacity of 28 to 56 sq ft (eight to 16 10-inch cartridges). 
More surface area means more dirt removed per cartridge changeout and 
less frequent changing. Coarse filter cartridges up to 100 micron are 
recommended for maximum dirt-holding capacity. 
<P>The second important method for ensuring a cleaner solution's 
longevity and effectiveness is proper agitation. Filtration systems will, at a 
minimum, double the life of a cleaner bath. While removing bulk particulates, 
the filtration system will provide some agitation. More aggressive agitation 
will assist the cleaning process by mechanically removing solids from parts. 
To provide a means of aggressive agitation, select a method that will not 
lower the temperature or introduce dirt or oils into the solution. Air agitation 
from a compressor or blower increases solution heating costs because the air is 
at ambient temperature, often lower than the bath's operating 
temperature. This will cause solution temperature to drop and require added heat 
to maintain proper temperature. Air agitation can also introduce oil and 
particulates to the solution from the compressor's lubrication system, and 
agitation from a blower will introduce airborne contaminants from the 
surrounding atmosphere. In addition, air bubbling up through the solution 
will increase emissions from the tank into the surrounding environment. 
For these reasons, air agitation is not recommended for cleaner tanks; nor is 
it recommended for many plating tanks. 
<P>Liquid agitation nozzles that vigorously circulate a properly filtered 
cleaner bath are recommended for agitation. Eductor nozzles are strategically 
attached to sparger piping and cleaner solution is driven through by a 
dedicated pump. Using the clean, filtered solution for agitation instead of 
air does not introduce additional oil and dirt. More uniform tank 
temperatures and reduced heat stratification reduce the amount of energy required 
by heaters. Increased mechanical agitation also minimizes the necessity 
to maintain the higher temperature otherwise required for optimizing 
cleaner performance. Evaporation and emissions associated with air agitation 
are also eliminated. As eductor nozzles sweep solution across the tank 
floor, particulates cannot settle on the tank bottom. Particulates held in 
suspension are more readily removed by the filtration system and deposited in the 
filter media. 
<P>If, after properly sized filtration and agitation equipment are installed 
and operating, residual surface oil still causes problems, oil removal 
equipment should be employed. Often, coalescers or ultrafilters are installed to 
remove surface oil on an unfiltered bath. Without the adequate bulk 
particulate removal, ultrafiltration and coalescing systems are plagued by 
constant plugging problems and greatly reduced flow. 
<P>For a relatively small investment, a coalescing system connected to 
an overflow weir or skimmer assembly on a properly agitated and filtered 
160F cleaner solution will effectively remove non-emulsified surface tramp 
oils. Coalescing systems can be run during production time or during off 
hours when the solution is cooler and coalescing efficiency is improved. 
Contact your chemical supplier for non-emulsifying cleaners to take advantage 
of coalescing technology. If an emulsifying cleaner must be used, 
ultrafiltration will effectively remove emulsified oils. 
<P>Always check the compatibility of construction materials for the 
proposed filtration, agitation and oil removal equipment with the cleaner 
chemistry. Cleaners run at 160 to 200F may require CPVC, yet some new 
high-alkaline cleaners tend to embrittle CPVC compounds. In these cases, 
polypropylene is recommended, but only up to 160F. Provide chemical manufacturers' 
MSD sheets to your equipment manufacturer for evaluation and 
recommendation. Immersion testing samples may be required if compatibility data is 
inconclusive. Reputable equipment manufacturers will provide material samples 
for test purposes. 
<P>By using this three-tiered approach (filtration, agitation, oil 
removal) substantial benefits and cost savings can be expected. First is the 
improvement in the consistency of final surface coating quality, which is 
directly related to minimization or elimination of scrap/rework. Next, a reduction 
of labor costs for tank maintenance can be expected. Continuously 
filtered solutions will not require decant, sludge scraping, retransfer and reheat 
of solutions. By extending cleaner life, reduction in expenditures for 
cleaning chemistry will be realized, and associated hauling costs or waste 
treatment problems will be greatly minimized. A properly filtered cleaner will 
also reduce oil/particulate dragin to plating tanks or other downstream 
process solutions. The savings these benefits provide quickly pay for 
equipment. Today's technology provides all the necessary equipment to 
achieve your liquid handling goals.
