</B>The third solar thermal technology, parabolic-dish generating systems, 
achieve the highest performance of the three solar thermal designs in 
terms of annually collected energy and absorption of peak sunlight.<a href="#353" name="r353"> [ 353 ] </a>
During the past 15 years, about eight systems ranging in size from a few 
kilowatts to 50 kilowatts have been built and operated in the United 
States, although recent development has largely been confined to industry 
and government cost-shared research and development. The DOE is investing 
in a utility-scale joint venture to develop a 25-kilowatt system that 
utilizes advanced Stirling engines at the concentrator focal point. The 
DOE hopes to spark commercialization of dish/Stirling systems, and expects 
the systems eventually to achieve capital costs of $1,500 per 
kilowatt-hour (for systems augmented by fossil fuels) and a levelized 
energy cost of 6 cents per kilowatt-hour.<a href="#354" name="r354"> [ 354 ] </a><P>

Generation (CPG) is a subsidiary of <A NAME="CumminsEngineCo.">Cummins Engine Co.</a> of Columbus, 
Indiana. CPG is America's foremost producer of dish/Stirling systems. CPG 
is developing two systems - a <BR>
7-kilowatt and a 25-kilowatt system -  both of which were selected by 
the U.S. DOE's Joint Venture Program for commercial demonstration. Under 
both contracts, CPG's systems will employ a free-piston Stirling engine 
driven directly by high heater head temperatures of 675&#176; Celsius. The 
entire structure of parabolic dishes will track the sun as it moves.<BR>

<P><A NAME="353"  HREF="#r353">353.</a> Parabolic dish generating systems consist of parabolic-shaped 
point-focus concentrators that reflect solar energy onto a receiver 
mounted at the focal point. Parabolic dishes typically use dozens of 
curved reflective panels made of glass or laminated films, mounted on a 
structure that tracks the sun. When the concentrated sunlight hits the 
receiver, it is either directly utilized by a heat engine, or used to heat 
a fluid that is transmitted to a central engine. <I>Id., </I>p. 457.<BR>
