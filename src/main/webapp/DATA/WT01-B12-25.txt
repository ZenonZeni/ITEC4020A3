<H1>SYNERGY PAK: Foundational Nutritional Program</H1>
<BR>
<HR>



<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT </H2>

<P>The four Life Plus products contained in the SYNERGY PAK work together synergistically to help you start your nutritional support program. Many of us want to begin a nutritional program but we do not know how or where to begin.  SYNERGY PAK contains the four basic nutritional products to help get you started.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TVM-49</H2>
<P><A HREF="mtvm.htm"> TVM-49</A> is one of Life Plus' most complete and comprehensive supplement ever formulated. It is an important component of the SYNERGY PAK as it contains all the vitamins, minerals, trace and ultra trace elements that have been classified as essential. The herbs and associated synergistic nutrients it contains helps ensure a broad spectrum nutritional base. TVM-49 contains at least 200% of the RDA's of all  vitamins  that  are  classified. TVM-49  is manufactured by strictly controlled cold processing methods and contains many "super foods" such as Lecithin, Bee Pollen, Kelp and bioflavonoids. These "super foods" contain many nutritional factors. It is presently formulated to not contain iron as recent research shows that even slightly elevated iron levels can stimulate the production of damaging free-radicals in the body leading to disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROTX II</H2>
<P> The specialty formula contained in <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A> supplies the nutrients for protecting body cells and our immune system from free radicals.  Free radicals assault our cells ever minute of every day.  They contain a super reactive type of oxygen that is eager to damage DNA. We obtain these from the food we eat, the air we breath, cigarette smoke) to name only a few.  These Free radicals are generated by chemicals in our environment, our diets and are produced by various kinds of radiation, electrical and ultraviolet light. PROTX II supplies us with a wide spectrum of certain antioxidant nutrients such as Vitamin E, Vitamin C and Vitamin A (as Beta-Carotene) and actually present themselves to the free radicals. They then react with them so that the constituents of our cells are protected. PROTX II ensures the body is provided with a broad spectrum of antioxidant nutrients on a daily basis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUSTENASE</H2>
<P> The unique method in which  <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE</A> is manufactured provides a product that employs a two phase method that naturally assists the digestion of the foods we eat.  This two phase method assists the stomach (phase 1) and in the intestine (phase 2). It helps to ensure that we receive the nutrients contained in our foods. Proper digestion reduces stomach stress, relieves discomfort from overeating and aids in preventing symptoms of improper digestion, such as gas, bloating, burping and heartburn. In the stomach phase, SUSTENASE helps maintain acid pH by supplying Betain HCI which activates the protein digesting enzyme, Pepsin.  In its intestinal phase, it helps maintain a more alkaline pH.   Complete digestion of proteins is helpful in preventing food allergies. As a component of the SYNERGY PAK it is a basic product that everyone should have at every meal.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE </H2>
<P>The  soluble  fibers  and  herbs  contained  in <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon.   They help ease conditions resulting from diets too low in fiber.  Most leading advisory panels recommend that our diets contain a minimum of thirty grams of fiber per day which is accomplished by one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE.  COLODYNE helps to naturally cleanse and correct chronic constipation. This great product contains beneficial bacteria that live in the digestive  tract  and  promotes  colon  hygiene, manufacture vitamins and helps maintain proper pi-I and control overgrowth of yeasts.  It also absorbs toxins that arise from incomplete digestion or contaminated foods.  Studies show that people with high  fiber diets  are  less  likely  to  develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.</A>
