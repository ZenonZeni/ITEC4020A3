<H2> <A NAME = "Matsuda"> Jujiro Matsuda (1875 - 1952) </H2>

<P> Matsuda was born August 6, 1875, 12th son of a fisherman in the
Hiroshima Prefecture.  His father died when he was three years old.  At
the age of 13 he got a job in a blacksmith shop in Osaka.  At the age of
20, in 1894 he started his own shop and employed 50 workers, but a
recession drove him out of business.  He tried again eleven years later
in converted cow shed.  His eldest son, Tsuneji (1897?-1971), pumped air
for the furnace.

<P> Jujiro Matsuda invented and patented a pump. It sold well, so he
formed the Matsuda Pump Partnership.  He was edged out a few years later
when the company was taken over.

<P> In 1912 Jujiro formed Matsuda Works.  In one year it employed 4000
workers to produce four million artillery fuses for the Russian Czar's
government.  Then it became Japan Armament Manufacturing Company.
Later he left to create a new Matsuda Works in Hiroshima.  Nihon Steel
Manufacuring Co. took this over.

<H2> <A NAME = "Toyo"> Toyo Kogyo 1920, 1927 </H2>

<P> A group of investors including Matsuda took over a failing Abemaki
tree cork company in January 1920, naming it Toyo Cork Kogyo Company
Limited.  Toyo means Orient and Kogyo means industry. Jujiro became
president the next year.

<P> In September 1927, Matsuda reformed the company as Toyo Kogyo Kaisha
(Company) Limited to grow out of Cork and into industrial production.  A
test run of 30 motorcycles were manufactured in 1930 or earlier, since
one of them won a race that year.

<H2> <A NAME = "MazdaDA"> Mazda Type DA Motorized Tricycle Truck 1931 </H2>

<P> Ahura Mazda is the Zoroastran lord of light, creator of the
universe.  The name is also very close to Matsuda.  Toyo Kogyo
successfully produced these 500cc three wheelers with differential
transmissions beginning in 1931.  A small passenger sedan protoype was
made in 1940, but this had to be abandoned.

<H2> <A NAME = "recovery"> Recovery after Atom Bomb </H2>

<P> The atom bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945, but the company was
fortunate that less than half of the plant was destroyed.  In 1950 Toyo
Kogyo produced the Type CT three-wheeler with 1157 cc V twin (32 bhp).
This was very successful.  In May 1960 the R360 air cooled coupe was
introduced with a 356 cc two cylinder rear mounted engine.  In 1962
there was the 358 cc four cylinder Carol sedan.  1963 saw the model
800 and Familia four with front engines and rear drive.

<P> Jujiro's son Tenuji became President of the Company in 1951. Jujiro
passed away in March 1952.  Tsuneji succumbed to a lung inflammation in
1971.  His son Kohei succeeded him until he stepped down in 1977.

<P> In 1984 the company name was changed to Mazda Motor
Corporation. Mazda has assembly plants in 21 countries and exports to
120 countries.

<P> In 1973, Mazda sold 104,960 cars in the US, twice the previous
year's total.  More than 92 percent had rotary engines.  The next year,
after the gas crisis had made its impact felt, Mazda sold only 61,192
cars in the US.
