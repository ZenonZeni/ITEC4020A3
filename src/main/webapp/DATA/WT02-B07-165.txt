<img align=left src="e.gif">thanol, a renewable fuel made from agricultural crops, is one of the best tools we have to fight urban air pollution. Ethanol reduces pollution through the volumetric displacement of gasoline, and by adding oxygen to the combustion process which helps to greatly reduce exhaust emissions. In fact, the use of ethanol results in reductions in every pollutant regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including ozone, air toxics, carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The EPA considers ozone to be the most widespread air pollution problem. Ethanol provides the 
following environmental benefits:

<h3>Reduced CO Emissions</h3>
<P>
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas that reduces the flow of oxygen in the bloodstream. It is formed by the incomplete combustion of petroleum fuels, which contain no oxygen. The EPA attributes two-thirds of CO emissions to transportation sources. Ethanol, since it contains oxygen, contributes to a cleaner, more efficient burn of gasoline which results in lower CO exhaust emissions. The EPA recognizes that the use of ethanol-blended fuels can reduce CO emissions from vehicle exhaust by as much as 30%. In addition to being a deadly poison, CO has been recognized as an ozone precursor since 1976.
<P>
<H3>Reduced Exhaust VOC Emissions/Ozone Formation</h3>
<P>
Ethanol reduces VOC emissions from automobile exhaust by adding oxygen to the gasoline, which results in more complete (cleaner) combustion. Reductions in exhaust VOCs are very important because exhaust emissions are very reactive, and therefore tend to form ozone more quickly and readily. Several studies have shown that by reducing exhaust VOC emissions and CO emissions, ethanol can help to reduce urban ozone more than any other fuel.

<H3>Reduced NOx Emissions</H3>
<P>
Another contributor to the formation of urban ozone is NOx. Several components of gasoline will greatly impact NOx emissions, including sulfur, olefins and aromatics. By displacing these components, ethanol can also help to reduce NOx emissions from motor fuels.
<P>
<H3>Reduced Air Toxics Emissions</H3>
<P>
A large fraction of the octane needed for today’s gasolines comes from toxic aromatic components such as benzene, toluene, xylene and tri-methyl benzenes. Ethanol provides an alternative to these octane enhancers, allowing significant reductions in toxic air emissions without sacrificing fuel performance.
<P>
<h3>Reduced Particulate Matter (PM10) Emissions</h3>
<P>
Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers (PM10) is emitted from a variety of stationary and mobile sources. PM10 is regulated by the EPA because these small airborne particles can reach the lower regions of the respiratory tract and cause serious health problems, including damage to lung tissue, cancer and premature death. The use of ethanol significantly reduces tailpipe emissions of PM10 from gasoline, and thus contributes to improved public health.
<P>
<h3>Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
<P>
Unlike virtually all other liquid fuels which come from fossil hydrocarbons, such as gasoline and natural gas, ethanol is produced from renewable feedstocks, including agricultural crops and forest residues, citrus and urban wastes and special energy crops. Fossil fuels essentially release carbon trapped in the soil into the atmosphere, where it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that traps the earth's heat, contributing to global warming. Plants, on the other hand, 'breathe' CO2 and give off oxygen, thereby maintaining the balance of CO2 in the atmosphere. The increased use of renewable biomass fuels like ethanol will partially offset the global warming effect of burning gasoline.
<P>
A U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) analysis concludes that the use of ethanol reduces CO2 emissions 27% more than gasoline, as well as reducing other greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2). Ethanol-blended fuels are the only commercially available fuels which have a CO2 benefit.

<h3>Ethanol - The Clean Air Solution</h3>
<P>
Because of their environmental benefits, the Clean Air Act requires the addition of oxygenates such as ethanol to gasoline in areas that exceed public health standards for ozone and CO, known as nonattainment areas. Today, approximately 35% of the nation’s gasoline contains some level of oxygenate in order to reduce harmful emissions and improve our nation's air quality.</TD>
