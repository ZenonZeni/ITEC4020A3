<B>Identifying Epilepsy-inhibiting Protein</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The University of Tokyo and the Institute of Cancer  Professor
Katsuhiko Mikosiba, The University of Tokyo Institute of Medical Science  et al.
found that a known protein which acts in cells inhibits epilepsy. The mice
lacking the genes which produce this protein developed the symptoms of epilepsy.
Thesymptoms disappeared when they received the therapeutic drugs for epilepsy.
The group considers that some cases of ill-defined epilepsy are caused by
abnormality in this protein. This protein is one of a group of receptors called
inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3). It is known as the protein which
controls the storage site of calcium ions in cells. The knockout mice lacking
IP3 had difficulty in walking at nine days and developed epileptic fits at
fifteen days. In receiving s drug such as barbital their fits stopped and in
receiving the drugs which inhibit the action of the drug their fits recurred.
Finding of the relationship between epilepsy and IP3 will advance the
clarification of the epileptic mechanism. The results of this study were
published in the English science journal &quot;Nature&quot; on January 11.
