As recently as ten or fifteen years ago, faculty teaching judicial process
courses were hard-pressed to find a text that would fit the bill. There
were a few excellent readers with essay collections, but very few single
books that focused exclusively on courts in the United States and that included
state as well as federal courts. Baum's AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY
is one of a number of outstanding recent books which can serve as first-rate
texts in a judicial process course. If this series of book reviews on judicial
process texts shows nothing else, it demonstrates how dramatically the field
has changed and how the rich scholarship on courts in American society has
finally made its way into texts for undergraduates.<BR>
<BR>
Lawrence Baum's AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY, now in its third edition,
is a solid, fact-filled text. Baum writes that the book's major goals are
description and explanation of how and why courts work the way they do.
A third -- but admittedly less important -- goal for the book is &quot;to
provide the necessary basis for judging reform proposals&quot; (p. x). Overall,
I think that the text succeeds in meeting these goals; descriptive and explanatory
analysis do (as promised in the introduction) dominate the discussion, but
some normative analysis is introduced. Like most judicial process texts,
Baum's book concentrates exclusively on American courts. The instructor
who seeks a more comparative view will have to introduce it through lectures
and other readings. <BR>
<BR>
The conceptual frame of the book is primarily behavioral. At the outset,
Baum introduces three general perspectives for understanding court processes
and outcomes: &quot;the legal, the environmental, and the personal&quot;
(p. 11). After explaining the benefits and limits of each view, and noting
that he will employ all of these perspectives in the book, Baum concludes
that he &quot;will give primary emphasis to the personal perspective, and
especially to the motives that underlie choices made by people in the courts&quot;
(p. 17). I like the fact that the book introduces different theoretical
approaches and then explicitly identifies the dominant approach of the text.
In this way, faculty who wish to introduce competing perspectives can present
alternative materials to supplement AMERICAN COURTS.<BR>
<BR>
One consequence of the &quot;personal&quot; perspective is the relative
attention that the book gives to various topics. The bulk of the book addresses
legal actors and legal processes, with much less attention to policy issues.
The book is organized in a fashion typical of most judicial process texts
(and courses). Chapters 1 and 2 present &quot;An Overview of the Courts&quot;
and &quot;Court Organization.&quot; The next three chapters discuss &quot;Lawyers,&quot;
&quot;Selection of Judges,&quot; and &quot;Judges.&quot; Chapters 6-8 cover
court processes, &quot;Trial Courts: Criminal Cases,&quot; &quot;Trial Courts:
Civil Cases,&quot; and &quot;Appellate Courts: The Process.&quot; A final
chapter addresses &quot;Appellate Courts as Policy Makers.&quot; The chapters
on lawyers, judges, and court processes are rich and comprehensive, drawing
extensively on the literature in the <BR>

field and presenting clear description and synthetic analysis. <BR>
<BR>
The book devotes much more attention to court process, however, than to
court outcomes. Only the last chapter discusses court policies in any depth,
with sections on &quot;Appellate Court Decisions as Policies&quot; (on appellate
court agendas, ideological patterns, and judicial activism) and &quot;The
Impact of Appellate Court Decisions&quot; (covering the literature on implementation
and impact). The chapter on civil court processes also includes excellent
sections on the &quot;litigation explosion,&quot; and on Galanter's argument
on &quot;Why the Haves Come out Ahead,&quot; in which Baum evaluates civil
court outcomes in areas of personal injury, debt collection, and divorce.
But many of the normative concerns that are raised elsewhere in the book
focus more on issues internal to the legal system, rather than on the political
and social impact of courts on society. For example, in the section on criminal
sentencing, Baum explains the sentencing process and evaluates the question
of consistency among judges in sentencing, but does not discuss trends on
incarceration or the use of probation. Other evaluative or critical sections
focus on issues such as court unification, competence of lawyers and judges,
and the effectiveness of trial decision-making.<BR>
<BR>
A second consequence of the book's &quot;personal&quot; perspective is that
the book is filled with data about people -- about lawyers and judges whose
personal and political conflicts and interests show how courts work. For
example, the chapter on court organization opens with an anecdote about
a 1990 bill to split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals into two parts,
California, Arizona and Nevada in one, and the Northwestern states in the
other. Senator Gorton of Washington sponsored the bill so that states in
the Northwest could escape what he called the domination &quot;by California
judges and by California attitudes&quot; while California Senator Pete Wilson
opposed it as &quot;environmental gerrymandering&quot; (p. 21). Baum explains
that &quot;splitting the circuit would prevent California judges from ruling
on environmental cases in the Northwest, and judges who came from the Northwest
themselves might be more sympathetic toward industries that were important
to the region's economy&quot; (pp. 21-22). In another example, the book
uses the 1989 battle between Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose and baseball
commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti to illustrate forum-shopping in diversity
jurisdiction. Rose sought to have his case heard in Ohio state court before
an elected judge from Cincinnati, rather than before an unelected judge
from Columbus in federal district court. <BR>
<BR>
These stories of personal and political conflict make for fascinating reading.
Thus, the text will appeal to undergraduates because of its lively, well-illustrated,
and occasionally humorous presentation of court processes. These are real
people making law, not abstract institutions or arcane rules. Moreover,
the legal realist conception of law and courts will resonate with today's
cynical and media-saturated students. For instance, when discussing lawyer
competence, Baum cites Judge Bazelon's comment that many criminal defense
lawyers are &quot;walking violations of the Sixth Amendment&quot; (p. 87).
Or, in the section on entry into the legal profession, Baum tells the story
of a man arrested for <BR>

impersonating a criminal defense lawyer in court; the judge supposedly remarked,
&quot;I should have suspected he wasn't a lawyer. He was always so punctual
and polite&quot; (p. 59). <BR>
<BR>
While descriptions of people and process abound in the book, Baum presents
fewer discussions of law and legal principles. Judges are quoted for remarks
such as these, or for their acid-tongued disagreements with each other,
but not for their statements of law. Instructors who use this book may want
to supplement it with court decisions and other reading which analyzes law
in terms of legal reasoning, language, or ideology. <BR>
<BR>
A real strength of Baum's book is its readability, clarity, and tone. My
students found it very interesting and informative to read. One student
explained to me that she sold all her other books at the end of the term
but kept AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY because &quot;it was so basic.
. . you never know when you'll need to know these things about courts.&quot;
The text draws on political science and legal scholarship, as well as numerous
newspaper articles. The wealth of data in the book is impressive especially
for the specific cases, surveys, and research studies used to illustrate
and support the analysis. Baum is also very even-handed when presenting
controversial topics, underscoring the complexity of research and the ways
in which values can influence the interpretation of results. This kind of
caution encourages students to think carefully about how to use data to
support their arguments and to be self-conscious about their own and others'
biases. <BR>
<BR>
One small weakness of the book in my mind is its slight tilt towards federal
law and courts. Although the book has excellent chapters on trial court
processes (including state courts), elsewhere the federal courts are presented
as the more important courts. For example, Baum states that &quot;only a
small proportion of all court cases are tried in federal court because the
great majority of cases fit under no category of federal jurisdiction and
thus go to the state courts by default&quot; (p. 24). Clearly the state
courts are not just a residual category for leftover federal cases! Also,
the discussion of the superiority of federal constitutional law over state
constitutional law (p. 3) could mislead students in their understanding
of judicial federalism in which state constitutional law has sometimes provided
for greater individual rights than has federal constitutional law.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, I have to say I think this book is somewhat overpriced. This weakness
is no fault of Baum's but his publisher really needs to do some comparative
price checking. AMERICAN COURTS: PROCESS AND POLICY is one of the more expensive
judicial process texts on a per page basis of any of those listed in the
current series under review. This paperback text would be more appropriately
priced at $22 or $25 to put it line with other similarly-sized books (rather
than the $30 recommended price). It would be too bad if cost deters faculty
from using what is otherwise an excellent judicial process text. <BR>
