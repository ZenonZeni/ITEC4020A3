<p>In the 15-34 year age group, the rate of drug-caused deaths
increases to one in three deaths.</p>

</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tobacco is responsible for the majority of drug-caused
        deaths in older persons aged 35 years and over (75% of
        drug deaths in this age group) </li>
    <li>Alcohol is responsible for the majority of drug deaths in
        younger persons aged 15-34 years (60%)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Opiates are responsible for 23% of drug-related deaths in
        the 15-34 age group compared to less than 1% in the 35
        and over age group.<p>In 1990, of the estimated 25 524
        deaths attributed to drug use, 71% were due to tobacco,
        26% to alcohol, 2% to opiates and 1% to other drugs,
        including pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter
        medications.</p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 MORBIDITY AND SOCIAL DYSFUNCTION">Drug

20% of general hospital admissions in Australia, and in over 20%
of general practitioner consultations.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 MORBIDITY AND SOCIAL DYSFUNCTION">Alcohol
use is a major factor in marital disharmony, violent crime,

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 ROAD ACCIDENTS">ROAD ACCIDENTS</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 ROAD ACCIDENTS">Alcohol use is a
major cause of road accidents leading to serious injury or death.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 ROAD ACCIDENTS">It has been estimated
that in 34% of road deaths alcohol is a contributing factor
(before 1979 the figure was over 50%) and the total number of
road deaths is falling (3730 in 1979; 1971 in 1992).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 ROAD ACCIDENTS">Although there is no
firm epidemiological evidence linking the use of other drugs as a
causative factor in road accidents there is much anecdotal
evidence. The risk of harm is high when some drugs, either
illicit or prescribed, eg cannabis or diazepam, are combined with
alcohol. <br>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">TRENDS
IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS <br>
</a></h2>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Tobacco</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Recent
figures from the 1991 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse
(NCADA) Household Survey indicate that tobacco was used in the
past year by 31% of males and 25% of females aged 14 and over.
Similar proportions of high school students also report using
tobacco. Although levels of smoking among teenagers have fallen
in recent years, the number of female teenagers who smoke still
exceeds that of males. In 1991, 21% of boys and 35% of girls
between 14-19 years reported smoking in the past year. (Appendix
3 provides information on use of various drugs by persons aged
14-19 years.)</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">There
has been a greater decline of smoking among males than females in
the past 15 years. The proportion of female smoking increased
from 26% in 1945 to 31% in 1976-80 but has since fallen to 27% in
1989. The proportion of males smoking has fallen since 1945 (when
it was 72%) to 30% in 1989. This represents no statistical
difference between male and female smoking rates for the first
time. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">In
1989 the highest smoking rate of Australian adult smokers was
found among 20-24 year olds for both males (41%) and females
(38%).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Mortality
rates due to smoking have decreased by 5% between 1987 and 1990
(from 111.7 to 106 deaths per 100 000 population). <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Alcohol</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
trend since the mid-1970s has been towards a decrease in the
amount of alcohol consumed in Australia (per capita consumption
of alcohol fell from 13.2 litres in 1978 to 7.9 litres in
1990-91).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Between
1985-86 and 1990-91 consumption of beer has decreased by 6%, wine
consumption has decreased by 19%, while overall, total alcohol
consumption (expressed as pure alcohol) decreased by 7%.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">In
1991, over 18% of all beer consumed was low alcohol beer. (Low
alcohol beer was not consumed before 1985.)</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">A
1989 survey highlighted increasing concern about heavy drinking
among young people &#150; 38% of 16 year olds and 40% of 17 year
olds consumed five or more drinks on their last drinking
occasion. It was also reported that in the 12-16 year age group,
22% of boys and 18% of girls reported weekly use of alcohol.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Alcohol
continues to play a major role in domestic violence.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Surveys
by the National Heart Foundation have shown that despite drinking
less often than older groups, young people (aged 20-24 years)
tend to drink more heavily on the occasions when they do drink.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Death
rates due to alcohol have fallen by 20% since 1979 (from 48.7
deaths per 100 000 population in 1979 to 39.0 in 1990).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">People
are now spending less of their total budget on alcohol than
previously (5.6% in 1981-82, 4.1% in 1991). <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Pharmaceutical
products</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">There
is no reliable evidence to demonstrate authoritatively patterns
or trends in the use of pharmaceutical products such as
sedatives, minor tranquillisers and analgesics. Restrictions on
the prescription of barbiturates over the past decade have
produced a fall in their use, and deaths from overdosage have
decreased by 75%.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
most commonly used prescribed drugs are cardiovascular system
drugs (19%) followed by psychotropic drugs (10%). There is some
concern about the use of psychotropic drugs because of their
ability to alter a person's mood, behaviour or perception.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Minor
tranquillisers, particularly benzodiazepines, are the most
commonly used psychotropic drugs in the Australian community. The
overuse of this drug, particularly by women and the elderly, has
been an area of concern for some time.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
use of benzodiazepines for long or continuous therapy, in
particular for night time sedation, is an undesirable practice.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Benzodiazepines
are commonly taken in overdosage both by accident and with
suicidal intent. Approximately 1% of drug-related deaths are due
to the misuse of prescribed and unprescribed pharmaceuticals.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Minor
analgesics are easily available and, although analgesic
nephropathy has decreased, the level of this disorder among women
in Australia remains high by international standards.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Cough
mixtures and antihistamines are commonly used for their
psychotropic effects, occasionally leading to dependence. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Illegal
drugs</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
1991 NCADA Household Survey reported that 32% of persons over the
age of 14 years had tried cannabis and 8% had used amphetamines
(excluding ecstasy).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Apart
from the use of cannabis, it seems that the level of use of
illegal drugs in Australia remains very low. This use has
remained at approximately the same level for the past ten years.
Appendix 4 provides a breakdown of persons using illicit drugs in
the past year.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
use of hallucinogens (eg LSD) seems to have remained at a minimum
level despite media reports about 'designer drugs' (ecstasy,
etc.). </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Heroin
use may be gradually diminishing in line with trends in other
countries. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">The
use of amphetamines and cocaine in general remains low in the
Australian population. (Appendix 5 provides information on the
proportion of the population who have ever tried various illicit
drugs.) However, recent evidence suggests that the number of
persons trying amphetamines is increasing, particularly among
males aged 25-39 (from 12% in 1988 to 19% in 1991) and among
females aged 14-24 (4% in 1988 to 11% in 1991).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Illegal
drug use, however, remains a major social problem.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Deaths
caused by opiates seem to be still increasing although the
numbers remain relatively small (117 in 1979 to 457 in 1991).</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Most
deaths involving illegal drugs are caused by overdosage or an
impure drug. Some of these deaths are suicides. Many injecting
drug users are infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis C and an
increasing number are infected with HIV/AIDS. Intravenous use of
amphetamines and cocaine is still causing little morbidity, but
an increasing number are presenting for treatment centres.
Needle-sharing and unsafe sexual practices continue to be a
significant problem.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">Cannabis
is the most widely used illicit drug in the Australian
population, with approximately one in three persons aged 14 and
over having tried this drug. This represents a slight increase in
use since 1988.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch1 TRENDS IN DRUG USE AND DRUG PROBLEMS">It
is possible that cannabis use may precipitate psychotic episodes
in those who are predisposed or have a history of psychosis.
Cannabis impairs psychomotor function but epidemiological
evidence to link cannabis with road accidents is still lacking.</a></p>
