<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Project<p>
Performing Organization:  Pacific Electric Vehicles</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: William Warf (707) 485­5799 </P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>The objective of this project is to provide a low cost composite
materials based two passenger neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) suitable for
regional American markets. </P>

<P>An initial project task was the purchase and evaluation of 3­wheel City­E1 NEVs
through use in representative fleets and private­driver programs. Through the end of
1995, these demonstration NEVs have logged nearly 60,000 miles.</P>

<P>This initial evaluation program helped characterize driving patterns and reinforced
that an NEV can effectively meet transportation needs in many industrial, urban and
suburban environments where low performance (speed and range) is acceptable. </P>

<P>The initial evaluation also helped identify design changes that would enhance the
acceptance of NEVs across a broader market. These include modification to a
4­wheel layout (to improve stability), and better driver protection (improved
crashworthiness). </P>

<P>A completely new, ground up NEV, called the Peregrin, was developed with these
changes in mind. The design is a monocoque construction capable of >40 mph ­­
more than adequate for surface street use.</P>

<P>The design uses conventional fibermatrix materials and processes to keep costs
down, yet the objective of satisfying Federal Safety Standards has been retained in
the design process making this the safest NEV now under development. </P>

<P>NEVs have the potential for greatly increased efficiency over traditional vehicles.
Although not targeted at the ambitious performance objectives of the PNGV, many
common areas of interest are involved in the Peregrin design. This purpose­built
NEV can be used for design configuration and subsystem evaluation, setting the
stage for higher performance versions.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P><P>The primary objective of this project is production of a
prototype NEV, the Peregrin, to be used in design development testing, market
study, and funding development. Completed activities include field testing of 40+
NEVs in public street and private industrial service. Redesign of thermoplastic
canopy tops for improved failure mode, as well as charger, battery and component
testing has been completed.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P> 

<P>The Peregrin prototype will be complete in May of 1996.</P>
