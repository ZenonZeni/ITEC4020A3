<blockquote><center><font size=5>Mitochondria</center></font>
<hr>

<FONT SIZE=4>Mitochondria.</font color="red"> They're the tiny, egg-shaped structures in your cells that serve as fat-burning furnaces. Too small to be seen
with the ordinary microscope, there are trillions in every human
body.  The more mitochondria surface you have in your cells, the easier
it is for your body to burn stored fat for fuel.  If you want to burn more body fat, you need to increase the amount  of mitochondrial surface in your cells.

<P>How can you do this? By increasing the amount of gentle exercise
you do every day, you will increase the mitochondrial surface
in your muscle cells. The result? It'll be easier for your body
to burn stored fat for fuel.</font>
<P>
How much gentle exercise does it take? You don't have to devote
a big block of time to it. Four fifteen-minute walks distributed
throughout your day can be just as productive as a continuous
hour of exercise. For most people, adding thirty to sixty minutes
of gentle activity every day will do the job. Remember: The more
mitochondria you have, the more easily your body can burn body
fat for fuel. As it becomes easier to use up excess body fat,
you'll lose weight more rapidly, move more easily, feel healthier
and become leaner.

<P>
Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh recently completed
a study of fifty-six sedentary, overweight women. Each began walking
and/or cycling five times a week for forty minutes. Half of the
women worked out continuously for forty minutes; the other half
divided their daily exercise into four ten-minute sessions.  
After twenty weeks, both groups had boosted their aerobic capacity.
But there was a difference. Not only did the women who exercised
more often, but for shorter periods, adhere better to their exercise
schedules, they also lost more weight.
<P>
It's important to create a schedule that works for you--one that
allows time to do whatever exercise you plan for the day, whether
in long sessions or short. Why not take a fifteen-minute walk right now? Let yourself be pleased. Let yourself get moving. Feel the difference.<BR>

Lean for Life also shares the insights and strategies of such
inspiring &quot;success stories&quot; as Diana Rosenfeld, who
lost 420 pounds on the Lean for Life program.  Rosenfeld's twice-yearly
&quot;update appearances&quot; on The Maury Povich Show generate
thousands of calls and letters from viewers seeking information
on a program that until now was available only in Southern California.
Rosenfeld serves as the official Lean for Life Ambassador and
is regularly featured in the national media.<BR>
