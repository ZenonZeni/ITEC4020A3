The Department of Mechanical Engineering has set up an advisory committee chaired by
Professor S.R. Karpik to help maintain a strong computer network for graduate research.  The
department employs a full-time computer specialist, F. Koerth, who is in charge of maintaining
the integrity of the system, installation and repair of equipment, and responding to user
problems.  The department has just replaced all the wiring and network devices in order to
accommodate the department's expanding needs and future technology.
 The Department of Mechanical Engineering has continued to respond to the growing
importance of computers with an excellent array of computing equipment for both teaching and
research purposes.  The latest technology is provided in a network of Sun workstations and
servers.  NCD X-terminals attached to 2 central servers, a Sun SPARC Server model 10/512 and
a Sun SPARC Server model 20/612, provide high level graphics capabilities.  Additional graphics
seats are provided by 5 Sun SPARC station 2 workstations, used cooperatively through the
Center for Computer Integrated Engineering (CCIE).  The central servers are also available for
computational tasks, document processing, electronic news and electronic mail service.  Sharing
over 15 GBytes of disk storage, 4 laser printers including a QMS Thermal Color Laser Printer,
four tape drives, and an 8 mm Exa-byte for high density backups, these UNIX systems are made
available to both undergraduates and graduate students; in practice, undergraduates do the bulk
of their work on a faculty-wide undergraduate system.  Numerous software packages are
available, including SDRC/I-DEAS, ANSYS, SUN PHIGS, Open Windows, LaTex, IMSL, UTEMP
(University of Toronto Mechanics Program), MATLAB, FRAMEMAKER, WordPerfect for UNIX
and  MAPLE.<p>

Apart from the UNIX systems, there is a large network of IBM PS/2's complete with servers
available to students who require DOS.  CAD/CAM is also supported by our IBM PC networks
which are equipped with various plotters and laser printers.<p>
 In addition to departmental research computers, numerous research laboratories have
dedicated computer systems as well.  In particular, the following laboratories have dedicated
DEC or Sun computers solely for the use of their research groups: Computational Mechanics,
Image Analysis, Engine Research, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Robotics and Automation. 
In all, there are about 60 interlinked computer systems with close to 100 terminals connected to
the central computing facilities.<p>
 In addition to the computing machines, the Department has established good communication
links with the Engineering Computing Facility (ECF).  The service provided by the ECF is
primarily for teaching, but may also be used for research activities as required.  In particular,
ECF operates a Silicon Graphics SGF 4D/480 system with 256 MB of memory which can be used
for research computing.  Beyond the facilities of the Faculty is the University's central
Computing Services (UTCF) which is both an IBM and UNIX shop.
