<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>GETTING THE ENERGY UP
<br>
TO GET OVER CHRONIC
<br>
FATIGUE SYNDROME</CENTER></H3>

Sometimes called Yuppie Flu, chronic EBV syndrome, or postinfectious
neuromyasthenia, this illness has  certain common features found in most cases. 
In order of prevalence, these include fatigue, low-grade fever, muscle pain,
sleep disorder, impaired mental abilities, depression, headache, allergies, sore
throat, anxiety, muscle weakness and joint pain, and about another dozen. 
<p>
But regardless of what you call it, alternative medicine has an answer for
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  (CFS) that you can put into action today. According to
Julian Whitaker, M.D., popularly known as "America's wellness doctor," there are
4 crucial steps you must take to get the energy up to get over CFS.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1</FONT> Start practicing the Whitaker Wellness Program. Adopt a healthy lifestyle,
which means get good nutrition, exercise, quit using tobacco, alcohol, and
recreational drugs, and take responsbility for your health.
<p>
Take a megavitamin-mineral supplement daily so that your intake is well above
the RDAs. Supplement this with a strong antioxidant program including vitamins C
and E. Then fortify everything with extra amounts of magnesium (1000 mg daily,
minimum) and potassium (about 400 mg daily), and essential fatty acids such as
omega-3s, and omega-6s, available through Evening Primrose, flaxseed, black
currant seed, borage, and fish oils. Finally, eat a diet high in complex
carbohydrates and low in fats.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2</FONT> Strengthen your immune system vitality. Do this by  taking calf 
thymus
extracts. If taken in the form of the commercially prepared ThymuPlex brand,
take 2 tablets (each containing 375 mg of active calf thymus components) twice
daily with your meals. The wonder herb Echinacea is also a powerful ally Getting
the Energy here, in dosages of 2-4 ml (1-2 teaspoons) of extract 3 times daily.
<p><A NAME="BOVINE"> </A>
<FONT SIZE=+2>3</FONT> Strengthen your adrenal function which is probably blown out by chronic stress
and inadequate nutrition.  Useful here are bovine adrenal extracts, taken orally
(dosage depends on your individual constitution and condition), and Siberian
ginseng extract (100 mg, 3 times a day).
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4</FONT> Here is Dr. Whitaker's shopping list of additional supplements to master CFS
and re-energize your life. If you're not already doing so, take extra vitamin C
so that your daily intake is in the range of 3000-8000 mg; extra vitamin E (1200
IU daily); elemental magnesium (1000 mg); and 1 tablespoon daily of flax seed
oil.
<p>
Dr. Whitaker says his approach is simple, straightforward, and effective. "It is
based on a simple truism of non-drug health care: a multifactorial problem is
best addressed with a multifactorial solution." 
(For more on this idea, <A HREF="i06-a06.shtml">see Dr.
Melvyn Werbach's  column, "Reflections on Healing," this issue</A> and see also 
<I>Alternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide,</I> "Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome." pp. 616-624.)

Natural Remedies for Osteoarthritis
</h3>
</center>
In case you're one of the 40 million Americans who have some degree of
degenerative joint disease, called osteoarthritis, or among the 80% of people
older than 50 who suffer from this most common form of arthritis, alternative
medicine has some good news for you.
<p>
Typically, all the joints in your body that bear any weight, plus your hand
joints, are the ones most affected by osteoarthritis. Joint cartilage starts to
stiffen up, restricting easy movement; then it starts to degenerate, and with
this comes pain, inflammation, deformity, and a restriction in your range of
motion.
<p>
First, you should know that foods can have both a beneficial and negative effect
on your condition. Foods that help all arthritic conditions include the high
flavonoid fruits such as cherries, blueberries, and blackberries. You also need
higher amounts of sulfur which you'll find in garlic, onions, brussels sprouts,
and cabbage.
<p>
On the other hand, you might want to cut back on your consumption of Deadly
Nightshade family foods such as potatoes, eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, and
tobacco. A study of 5000 arthritis patients showed that 70% of those who
eliminated these foods from their diet had relief from their aches.
<p>
Second, there is the matter of nutritional supplementation.  You need extra
amounts of antioxidants, which fight free radicals in your system released from
normal metabolism and environmental toxins. Useful here are vitamins C
(1000-3000 mg daily) and E (600 IU daily), plus the minerals selenium,
manganese, zinc, and boron,  and vitamins B3 (as niacinamide, up to 900 mg daily), 
B6, and pantothenic acid.
<p>
Naturopaths who work with osteoarthritis also recommend glucosamine sulfate (500
mg, 3 times daily) which will stimulate your system to repair its cartilage.
Along with this, take cartilage extracts, which include sea cucumber,
green-lipped mussel, shark cartilage, and purified chondroitin sulfate.
<p>
There are a handful of effective plant remedies to try out as well. These
include licorice root, dong quai, and alfalfa, all of which contain
phytoestrogens that  keep your body's own estrogen from binding to your
cartilage cells. The Indian herb Boswellia serrata gets good results, in 
dosages of 400 mg, 3 times daily. The African herb Devil's Claw works against
inflammation and has an analgesic effect, taken in dosages of 4-6 ml, 3 times
daily, as an extact, or 1-2 g as a tea made from dried powdered root.

A Thumbnail Guide to Living Headache-free
</h3>
</center><A NAME="ache"> </A>
A headache can ruin your day yet you don't want to survive on aspirins and
Tylenol. Alternative medicine has a headful of practical answers, starting with
a look at how you can change your diet to stop the lightning bolts from searing
through your brain.
<p>
For one thing, your conventional pain medications may be giving you the
headaches in the first place. Vitamin B6 supplementation can take care of this
possibility. High levels of dietary copper, found in foods such as chocolate,
nuts, wheatgerm and shellfish,  have been linked to migraines.
<p>
If you get PMS headaches, it might be because the magnesium count in your red
blood cells is too low; try 100-200 mg of magnesium for a few days as a remedy.
If cluster headaches are your bane, your red blood cells may be lacking choline,
which you can get through fish oils and omega-3 fatty acid supplements. 
<p>
Don't overlook the possibility of undiagnosed food sensitivities and allergic
reactions to favorite items in your diet (see our cover story, The Allergy-free
Body, this issue). More specifically, sub-stances such as aspartame, caffeine,
cheese, chocolate, milk, nitrates and nitrities (in hot dogs and cured meats),
red wine, and tyramine (found in aged cheeses, some red wines, fermented
sausages, sour cream) are all known to provoke headaches in susceptible people.
<p> 
So how do you undo the vise-clamp in which your headache holds your brain?
Capsaicin, the active ingredient in cayenne pepper, can give you some relief;
rub it directly on your temples, using a commercially prepared ointment if
available. Inhaling it gently through the nose is also effective for cluster
headaches. The herb feverfew, available as an extract, works against migraines.
Try a dosage of 25 mg dried leaves, 2 times daily, or perhaps 1 dosage of 80 mg
if you feel a migraine attack coming on. But if it's already in progress, 1-2 g
may be needed.
<p><A NAME="ging"> </A>
And there's always ginger to consider for relief of migraine, especially for the
nausea and vomiting part of it. A woman who had a long history of migraines
stopped all medications and started taking 500 mg of dried ginger, mixed with
water, as soon as she felt the earliest signs of migraine. She repeated this
every 4 hours for the next 4 days. She felt better within the first 30 minutes
and had no side effects. Afterwards, she started using fresh ginger as a regular
condiment in her cooking. She had migraines much less frequently, and when they
came, they were much milder than ever before.

<BR>Here's Your Own Herbal Detoxification Program</CENTER></H2>


<P>Eliminate it or be forever clogged up-that's one way to paraphrase one of the
key principles of well-being. Your body is equipped with a variety of natural
channels of elimination, including the colon, skin, lungs, kidneys, and
lymphatic system.  The ease and success of your body's natural rhythms of

<P>Eliminate it or be forever clogged up-that's one way to paraphrase one of the

channels of elimination, including the colon, skin, lungs, kidneys, and
lymphatic system.  The ease and success of your body's natural rhythms of
elimination in turn depend on healthy metabolism and digestion. 


<P>But too often our lifestyle and dietary choices and the simple stress of living
can weaken, even clog up the whole works. Naturopaths suggest that at least once
a year you do an internal housecleaning. Here are some herbal suggestions,
courtesy of herbalist Richard Scalzo, president  of Gaia Herbs of Harvard,
Massachusetts,  for your complete self-care detoxification program.


<P><B>MOVE IT OUT.</B> Mix 3 parts psyllium husks, 1 part Ayurvedic Triphala powder,  and the powders
of marshmallow root (1/3 part), licorice root (1/4 part), and ginger root (1/8
part). This makes a blend that will gently dredge and empty the 25 feet of your
intestines. Use 1 teaspoon of dry mixture with 10 ounces warm water, shake
thoroughly, and drink this twice daily, on rising and before bed.

<A NAME="LIVER"> </A>
<P><B>ENERGIZE YOUR LIVER.</B> Make an Elixir of Bitters  to aid your liver and digestive system. Mix dried
amounts of Indian gooseberry (2 parts), tumeric root (3 parts), milk thistle
seed (2 parts), calamus root (1 part), wild yam root (1.5 parts), gentian root
(1 part), fennel seed (1 part), cardamon seeds (1 part), ginger (1/4 part),
bitter orange oil (pinch),  extract of marine algae (pinch). Boil in 1/2 gallon
of water for 45 minutes; then strain off liquid and dispose of herbs. Drink 4
ounces of this tea, 3 times a day, before meals.

<A NAME="KIDNEY"> </A>
<P><B>RELAX YOUR KIDNEYS.</B> Your kidneys never get a vacation, not even for a minute, so give them  a little
support. Prepare a mixture of dried herbs including juniper berry (4 parts),
goldenrod flowers and leaves (3.2 parts), horsetail (2 parts), corn silk (2
parts), cleavers (2 parts), marshmallow root (1 part). Boil in 1/2 gallon of
water for 45 minutes; then strain off liquid and dispose of herbs. Drink 4
ounces of this as tea, 3 times daily, between meals.


<P><B>LET YOUR BLOOD BE GOOD.</B>This mixture helps remove metabolic wastes from your blood while remineralizing
it. Mix fresh amounts of red clover  blossoms (3 parts), stinging nettle leaf
(1 part), cleavers (1 part), yellow dock root (1.5 parts) burdock root (2
parts), yarrow flowers (1 part), plantain leaf (1 part), licorice root (1 part),
prickly ash bark (1/2 part). Boil in 1/2 gallon of water for 45 minutes; then
strain off liquid and dispose of herbs. Drink 4 ounces of this as tea, 3 times
daily, between meals.


<P>Gaia Herbs president Richard Scalzo recommends that you maintain this 4-part
herbal internal cleansing program for 6-8 weeks. At the same time, give your
whole system a break by eating lighter and fresher, less frequently, and simply
less. Increase your liquid intake, especially warm water, having a cup  every 20
minutes. Get extra exercise and fresh air and enjoy your  greater sense of
well-being.
