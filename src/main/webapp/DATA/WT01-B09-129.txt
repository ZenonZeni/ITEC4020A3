<h3>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium (SETC)</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Electric & Hybrid Vehicle Data Collection Project<p>
Performing Organization: Sacramento Municipal Utility District</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: SMUD: Craig Childers (916) 732­6350, cchilde@smud.org
</P>
<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P><P>The Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium Data Collection
Project is collecting data to study how well SETC Electric and Hybrid vehicles perform
under a variety of controlled test and real­live fleet driving conditions. Accurate monitoring
of vehicle performance is a necessary part of SETC EV/Hybrid development projects,
infrastructure development, utility power planning, and fleet operations planning.
</P>
<P><B>Data Collection Project Objectives: </B></P>
<ol>
<P><LI> To quantify performance characteristics of Sacramento Consortium Electric Vehicles,
Hybrid EVs, battery packs, and electric drive system components, </P>

<P><LI>Utilize this data to evaluate progress and provide feedback for Sacramento
Consortium EV development efforts, and </P>

<P><LI> To share performance data and measurement developments with other ARPA
Consortia and the EV community.</P>
</ol>

The SETC EV/ Hybrid Data Collection Project consists of several sub­projects:

<P><B>Monthly EV Energy Use Logging: </B></P><P>All SMUD EVs are presently being equipped with
AC kwhr meters. Upgrades to be made in l 996­1997 will include addition of hour meters
and development/ installation of totalizing DC kwhr meters on selected vehicles. These
systems are manually read once a month, and recorded values are entered into SMUD's
vehicle database.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensor Harness Development:</B> </P><P>A standardized set of sensors is under development
that will allow use with a variety of data recording systems, including both the Manual and
Automatic ARPA systems described below. REV E installations include current probes
for battery pack and aux. system, battery pack and aux. power voltage, 6 temperature
probes, 2 accelerometers, tilt­meter, and odometer/speedometer. Future revisions will
include motor power measurements, altitude/pressure, vehicle heading or location from
GPS system, hybrid current, and multiple accessory on/off status.</P>

<P><B>Manually Operated ARPA Time­Series Data Acquisition Systems: </B></P>

<P>These data systems are manually operated by EV program personnel during periodic vehicle testing,
standardized test trips, and routine trips. Systems setups are flexible,
laptop­computer­based, and can display a variety of real­time parameters for vehicle
operators. Data recording is done on laptop PC drives, and is archived and analyzed
later to provide feedback on vehicle performance to SETC programs for battery, drive
system, hybrid power source, or vehicle development. Data is also converted to ARPA
Electric Vehicle National Data Center (EVNDC) format and downloaded to the EVNDC
data base at the University of Hawaii for further analysis and data sharing amongst
consortia.</P>

<P><B>Automatic Recording ARPA Time­Series Data Acquisition Systems: </B>
</P>
<P>These systems will provide much of the same Time­Series data as Manual systems for the same purposes, but will allow data collection in vehicles issued to routine users. Systems will run automatically with no effort on the part of the vehicle operator, and data will be stored in large­capacity drives, transmitted over radio link, or communicated through the
charging station connection. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P>The overall EV data collection effort will continue throughout the deployment of EVs in
Sacramento. Near term milestones include:</P> 
<P><UL>
<LI>Monthly EV Logging­ Instrument Upgrades 6/96­ 6/97
<LI>Manual ARPA Time­Series DAS Improvements 2/96­ 6/97
<LI>Additional Manual ARPA Time­Series DAS Deployment 5/95­ 3/98 
<LI>Automatic ARPA Time­Series DAS Development 2197­6197 
<LI>Automatic ARPA Time­Series DAS Deployment 6197­3198 
<LI>Vehicle qualification and periodic performance testing ONGOING</UL> 
</UL>
