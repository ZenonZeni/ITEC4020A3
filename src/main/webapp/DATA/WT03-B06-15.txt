STABILITY, BUT LIMITED OPPORTUNITY

The stable federal structure is buttressed by the support of the two
dominant component emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  The federal
government will continue to be led by President Zayed bin Sultan al-
Nahyan of Abu Dhabi; the prime ministership will be held by Sheik
Maktum bin Rashid al-Maktum, the current ruler of Dubai.  If either
leader leaves office for reasons of health, he will be replaced by a
younger member of the respective family.  The pressure for democratic
reform is weak.  Islamic fundamentalism will not seriously threaten
the government.  The economy will remain heavily dependent on oil,
despite attempts at diversification.  As a result, growth will be
modest, at best, and inflation will show some upward movement.
Opportunities for foreign business are expected to be limited,
despite some modest attempts to attract foreign investment through
liberalization.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:  UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

January 8, 1995     Sheik Mohammad bin Rashad al-Maktum was named
                    crown prince of Dubai to ensure a smooth
                    succession in the event of his father's death, a
                    move that was welcomed by international business.

January 31, 1995    In a keynote speech, Sheik Mohammad called for
                    rehabilitation of Iraq by the Arab Gulf states.

June 1995           UAE recognized Sheik Hamad as the new ruler of
                    Qatar.  Hamad overthrew his father in a bloodless
                    coup.

June 1995           Business survey rated Dubai the world's largest
                    container port.

Mid-July, 1995      The Iranian government affirmed its claim to the
                    Abu Musa and Tunb islands, saying the islands
                    belong to Iran "eternally."  The UAE persisted
                    with its efforts to refer the dispute to the
                    International Court at The Hague.

Mid-July, 1995      Sheik Abdel Munim al-Ali was arrested for
                    "preaching subversion" and sentenced to
                    deportation.

October 1995        A Filipina maid's death sentence for murdering
                    her employer was changed to 100 lashes and
                    deportation by an Abu Dhabi court after the
                    victim's family agreed to accept blood money.
