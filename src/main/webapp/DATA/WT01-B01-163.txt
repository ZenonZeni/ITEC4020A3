<h2>Key to Balkans: A free press</h2><p>
By Kati Marton<p>
They don&#146;t shoot reporters--or even jail them anymore--in postwar former Yugoslavia. Today, the authoritarian governments of the Balkans use more subtle measures to control the media. <P>

After a 10-day fact-finding trip to Sarajevo, Belgrade, and Zagreb and talks with the leaders of all three countries, I am convinced a healthy democratic opposition will not take root here without stronger Western pressure on Serb, Croatian, and Bosnian leaders. All three leaders--Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman, and Alija Izetbegovic--promised to uphold the right to free speech and free press in Dayton, but all three are falling far short of delivering on that promise.<P>

The Balkan media&#146;s plight goes much further than the issue of the population&#146;s legitimate rights of free speech and free press. It was the media in Belgrade, Zagreb and, to a much lesser degree, Sarajevo that fueled the ethnic passions that unleashed the war. It is now essential for the security of Europe and the United States that we insist on the establishment of free media in Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia.<P>

The situation is critical in Bosnia. In September, nationwide elections will be held that will anchor the fragile new entity of Bosnia-Herze  govina to a new central government. Without a free press, the dream of reviving a multiethnic society after years of savage violence will fade. Although the guns that killed 45 reporters during the war are quiet now, it is still too dangerous for Bosnian journalists to cover more than a sliver of the country. The brave ones who try come back shaken from the experience, with stories of being pulled off the road when Serb militia loyal to the indicted war criminal who still heads the Bosnia Serbs--Radovan Karadzic--spotted their Sarajevo plates and hauled them in for "questioning."<P>

In Bosnia, like elsewhere, television is how most people get their news. What limited television there is (only one of nine transmitters survived the war) is under the control of President Alija Izetbegovic&#146;s ruling party. This makes it difficult for opposition candidates like former Prime Minister Haris Silajdic to get their message out in the election campaign. Ironically, Radio Free Europe, deemed a relic of the Cold War elsewhere and never before heard in Yugoslavia, has become the most popular radio in Bosnia, as close as most people think they&#146;ll get to the straight story. <P>

In Belgrade and Zagreb, independent media are controlled by the use of "financial police": government accountants who swoop down on opposition press and find their bookkeeping wanting. On April 25, such "accountants" swept into the office of the Croatian weekly <CITE>Panorama</CITE> and ordered all staff to leave in 15 minutes. The magazine remains shut.* The reason: alleged "failure to meet technical, health, and ecological standards necessary for operating."<P>

When I asked President Tudjman why his government is suing another independent paper, <CITE>Novi List</CITE>, for a ruinous sum, Tudjman ordered an aide to fetch the cover of the satiric weekly <CITE>Feral Tribune</CITE>, which featured Tudjman&#146;s face atop Rambo&#146;s body. "Would any other world leader put up with this?" he asked. "All leaders in democracies," I replied, but without much effect on him.<P>

Another technique both Milosevic and Tudjman use to quiet the voices of dissent is to claim that formerly state-controlled media were "improperly privatized." Using that device, Serbian police entered Belgrade&#146;s Studio B and pulled the plug. Now all Serb television is under Milosevic&#146;s control. But Milosevic assured me, revealingly, that he has instructed the media to tamp down their former anti-Muslim and anti-Croat fervor and get behind the Dayton Accords.<P>

Milosevic also controls newsprint, the lifeblood of newspapers, and thus manipulates the independent dailies&#146; circulation. <CITE>Nasa Borba</CITE>, the major independent daily in Serbia, struggles to reach more than 10,000 readers, whereas <CITE>Politika</CITE>, the pro-Milosevic paper, never suffers from a newsprint shortage and reaches 300,000 readers. To go from <CITE>Nasa Borba&#146;s</CITE> shabby offices to Politika&#146;s high-tech home, bristling with security men, is to understand the effective uses of press control in Serbia. <CITE>Politika&#146;s</CITE> colorful editor, Hadji Antic, who described his editorial policy as "inclined toward the official story," said if the other papers have circulation problems it&#146;s because they&#146;re no good.<P>

But the Balkan leaders are not the implacable dictators of the past. There are many pressure points. Serbia badly wants the remaining sanctions lifted. Bosnia, the real victim in the war, as well as Serbia and Croatia, need Western investment, IMF loans, European Union membership, and respectability. In their need is our opportunity. A price must be exacted for all those things, and part of that price should be the one ingredient that separates a democracy from every other form of government: a free press. <P>
