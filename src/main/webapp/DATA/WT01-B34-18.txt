<p> The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs is
perhaps the best book ever written on the subject of drug policy.
The authors did five years of research in preparation to writing
it and the facts they found are absolutely fascinating,
regardless of what you may believe about drugs or drug policy. </p>

<p> If you have not read the full text, you should go to the
library immediately and read it. It is a fascinating book and is
certain to change many of your opinions. </p>

<p> This book is a copyrighted work and we have not yet obtained
permission to put it on the net. However, we will include a
chapter-by-chapter synopsis of the major points. We will also
post information where you can buy a copy of the full text. Read
this book! </p>
