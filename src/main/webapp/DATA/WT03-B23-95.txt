<p><b><A NAME="about aline">ABOUT ALPHALINE</A></b> </p>

<p><b>Alphaline</b> began operation in 1985 as a response to young people's
uncertainty of their rights when in contact with the police, and their
inability to obtain legal advice outside of office hours. The establishment
of Alphaline was seen as a means of reducing friction between police and
young people by the provision of correct legal advice. </p>

<p><b>Alphaline</b> is a 24 hour <b>emergency</b> legal advice telephone
service, especially designed for young people under 25 years in crisis.
It is available for young people living, working or studying in Fitzroy/
Collingwood/ Richmond/ North Melbourne/ Brunswick and Carlton. </p>

<p><b>Alphaline</b> offers 'emergency' phone advice on the rights and responsibilities
of a young person when apprehended by the police. In some circumstances
Alphaline lawyers are also available to attend police stations to act as
the legal representation for any young person who lives within the catchment
area above. </p>
