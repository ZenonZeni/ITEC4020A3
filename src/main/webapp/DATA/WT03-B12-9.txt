'MOTHER OF ALL CONCURRENT EDITORS' DEBUTS

Researchers at the University of Florida (Gainesville) may have solved one
of the thorniest problems of distributed computing--how to give multiple
users access to the same file without having one user overwrite another's
work. The researchers have developed a word processor called The Mother of
All Concurrent Editors (MACE) that saves changes by locking only a portion
of the file. MACE works across TCP/IP networks as well as single systems.
Here's how it works: When a user calls a document, it appears on screen,
along with the names of other users working on that same document. To make
changes to the document, users lock the portion of text they are working
on. These locks are managed centrally, so that all other users are aware of
them. Other users can watch the locked text change, but they cannot
interfere. When the writer saves changes, the locks are relinquished, and
other users can access that text. MACE isn't the first concurrent editor,
but it is much larger in scope than its predecessors. It also has an open
architecture to which other applications can be added.

WELLFLEET'S STAR RISES; CISCO SNUBBED

Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) is still easily the leading vendor
of routers, but Wall Street analysts have taken note of recent inroads made
by Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.). In September, Goldman
Sachs (New York) issued a bulletin downgrading its opinion of Cisco from
''fairly valued'' to ''fully valued,'' while simultaneously reiterating its
attractive rating of Wellfleet stock. ''We think Cisco's stock is not
likely to rise further and may decline,'' the bulletin stated. Goldman
Sach's positive assessment of Wellfleet is based in part on the company's
announcement that the three major long-distance telephone companies--AT&T
Network Systems (Morristown, N.J.), US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas
City, Mo.) and MCI Telecommunications Corp. (Washington, D.C.)--had all
signed contracts to purchase Wellfleet products for use and resale. ''This
represents a major endorsement of Wellfleet's architecture over its
competitors by a sophisticated evaluation trio,'' the Goldman bulletin
said.

VITALINK, NSC FORM R&D, MARKETING STRATEGIES

The merged companies of Vitalink Communications Corp. (Fremont, Calif.) and
Network Systems Corp. (NSC, Minneapolis) have hammered out their marketing
and product strategies. NSC's host connectivity products will be largely
unaffected by the merger. Research and development for each company's
routers will remain separate, while all marketing will be handled by
Vitalink under the leadership of its chief executive officer, Les Denend.
The router lineup will consist of Vitalink TransPath routers and TransLAN
bridges, NSC's 6000 Series routers, the 4000 Series of SNA connectivity
products from Netlink Inc. (Raleigh, N.C.) (see ''SNA, LAN, and DEC Traffic
on One Backbone,'' New Products/Internetworking, page 135), and the 8000
Series of connectivity products from Coral Network Corp. (Marlborough,
Mass.). Although the 8000 and 6000 Series overlap in some respects, the
Coral router has unique capabilities including fault tolerance, and support
for networks made up entirely of T3 or other high-speed communications
lines, Denend says. Future research and development efforts will center
mostly on 6000, 4000, and 8000 products, rather than on Vitalink's TransLAN
and TransPath products. Enhancements to the Vitalink products will involve
code upgrades and connectivity options such as frame relay, but the
architecture and capabilities will not undergo any fundamental changes or
be the basis for future products.

FTP DEVELOPERS PREFER OS/2 TO WINDOWS

Writing for Windows is like walking on thin ice, while OS/2 is a
developer's dream, at least according developers at FTP Software Inc.
(Wakefield, Mass.), which last month introduced a Windows and OS/2 versions
of its TCP/IP software, called PC/TCP. The developers say Windows crashes
if an application doesn't behave perfectly and is extremely difficult to
debug. Worse, they add, is the fact that Windows lacks many needed
facilities for communications applications. There's no way to share I/O
between multiple processes, no queuing system, and no way for DOS
applications to open device drivers at the same time. FTP had no choice but
to build all the necessary facilities itself. In contrast, the OS/2 version
of PC/TCP was a breeze to develop, the company reports.

LOW-END NICS SALES REMAIN STRONG

High-end 16- and 32-bit network interface cards (NICs) may grab the
headlines, but their sales don't come close to those for good old-fashioned
8-bit NICs, according to Lisa Alloca, senior product manager for desktop
products at Racal-Datacom (Sunrise, Fla.) and Bob Jones, director of
communications products at NCR Corp.'s Microelectronics Products Division
(Fort Collins, Colo.). The two companies last month introduced a jointly
designed Ethernet chip set and a Racal Ethernet NIC that uses the chip set.
''We've been waiting to kill off our line of 8-bit NICs for years now,''
Alloca says. She adds, however, that 8-bit NICs still account for 50
percent of all sales.

SPRINT TO LAUNCH FRAME RELAY SERVICE

US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas City, Mo.) says it will launch its
frame relay service starting next month. The company says it has been
beta-testing the service, announced last fall, with the accounting firm of
Ernst & Young. Once it is generally available, users will be able to access
the service at 56-kbit/s, fractional T1, and T1 speeds. Sprint also will
offer a more expensive ''reserved'' service, under which customers will
always have access to a given amount of bandwidth. Standard service does
not include the guaranteed-bandwidth feature, and is priced comparably with
other frame relay services, Sprint says. Reserved service will be priced on
a monthly rate, while standard services will include both fixed and
usage-based components.

BABY BELLS START FRAME RELAY TRIALS

Pacific Bell (San Francisco) and Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. (St.
Louis) have both announced frame relay trials to begin this year.
Southwestern Bell says it will launch a general offering in early 1992;
Pacific Bell wouldn't commit to an offering, but says it is examining the
service in the context of real-world applications. Both sets of trials are
for 56-kbit/s and T1 (1.544-Mbit/s) rates. Both companies also are
considering Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) technology, and
Pacific Bell says it will offer SMDS in early 1992, pending approval by the
California Public Utilities Commission..

FRAME RELAY AT 45 MBIT/S

Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) recently added support for frame
relay protocols at 45-Mbit/s to its internetworking routers. The frame
relay support is available as part of the company's X.25/Packet switch
software, which runs on an AGS+ router equipped with a high-speed serial
interface (HSSI)/T3 interface card. Depending on the router chassis size,
the software costs $750 to $3,200.

LOOK MA, NO LAN: SOFTWARE GAINS MORE OPTIONS

Concurrent Controls Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.) is adding more
connectivity options for its flagship Concurrent DOS software. The product,
an operating system that allows multiple users to share DOS and Windows
applications on one 386-based PC via terminal emulation. Concurrent DOS
costs $795 for a five-user package, which the company says is cheaper than
adding a LAN segment. The company plans to add support for multiple Novell
server sessions in the first quarter of 1992. Presently, Concurrent DOS
users on one PC can communicate with one NetWare server. Token ring and
Unix support are scheduled for the third quarter of 1992, the vendor says.
Concurrent DOS already contains hooks for use with Netbios application
development tools, such as ZIM from Zanthe Information Inc. (Ontario,
Canada). It also has hooks for communications packages that deploy Netbios,
particularly for communicating from PC to hosts. Concurrent DOS supports
all DOS and Microsoft Windows applications, including paged interrupt
applications that address PC serial ports, single-user
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs, and Microsoft's CD-ROM
extensions. It comes with electronic-mail and remote access capabilities,
security features, file transfer utilities, and a job scheduler that runs
unattended file transfers.

FRAME RELAY
CONGESTION MANAGEMENT:
TOO MANY OPTIONS?

By:
Nick Lippis

No matter if a network carries data, voice, or video, congestion management
is--or should be--a constant concern. And congestion management can be
boiled down to two basics: avoidance (staying out of trouble in the first
place) and recovery (getting out of the trouble you should have foreseen).
    It's not exactly brain surgery, but too many network planners and
managers still think the best way to eliminate congested links is to throw
more bandwidth (and money) at the problem. When it comes to bursty,
unpredictable internetworking traffic, though, congestion management starts
to resemble a fine art.
    The whole attempt to interconnect high-speed LANs via relatively
slow WANs presents some particularly thorny congestion problems. Part of
the trouble can be traced to the fact that computer network architectures
and telecommunications infrastructures evolved separately, so there's a
disjuncture in the way each discipline approaches congestion management.
The new virtual data services--like SMDS and frame relay--now being jointly
developed by the telecom and computing industries should go a long way
toward closing this traditional gap. But questions have been raised all
along about frame relay's congestion management abilities.
    It's true that frame relay's streamlined protocol stack reduces by
about two-thirds the processing overhead associated with X.25, the chief
alternative for public packet-switched service. But it's also true that
this streamlining means frame relay doesn't offer any of X.25's congestion
management techniques (error correction and detection, for example). When
frame relay networks reach a certain congestion threshold, the frame relay
switches start to drop packets. If the congestion becomes severe enough,
the network can collapse.
    The chief cause of this congestion is the way in which connections
are made to a frame relay network, usually via an internet nodal processor
(INP), such as integrated bridge/multiprotocol router, rather than the dumb
terminals used with X.25. For every INP, there are typically 100
end-systems (some combination of PCs, workstations, and minis) pushing
packets onto the network, which quickly adds up to a pretty hefty load.
    It's not that frame relay is without any form of congestion
management. In fact, the American National Standards Institute's ANSI
T1.618 spec addresses this issue.
    The trouble is, congestion management for frame relay is optional,
even though ANSI has defined several approaches. To date, there's no
consensus among vendors and carriers as to who will support which
alternatives.
    ANSI has specified two congestion notification bits in the frame
relay header: forward explicit congestion notification (FECN) and backward
explicit congestion notification (BECN).
    The FECN bit is set when a packet passes through a congested frame
relay switch. It's up to the INP to read the bit and notify the logical
network (DECnet, TCP/IP, IPX, AppleTalk) that it's time to throttle back on
the number of packets being sent.
    This type of congestion avoidance is a natural for connectionless
protocols that use the receiver end of a link for congestion management. In
essence, once it has been notified that the FECN bit is set, all a logical
network need do is reduce the size of the window that defines the number of
packets that can legally be sent onto the frame relay net.
    But there's a catch: Most of today's peer-to-peer protocols do not
support the FECN bit (the chief exception being DECnet Phase V/OSI). The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), for instance, has yet to define the
one bit in the IP header that would allow it to recognize FECN. It's not a
matter of technology: The IETF, like the CCITT, can do no more than
recommend FECN; it's up to the various IP communities to implement it.
Since the FECN bit by definition limits traffic, considerate users of a
network (who work with FECN to reduce congestion) could potentially lose
out to more selfish networkers who keep pushing packets even when
congestion is present.
    The BECN bit, in comparison, informs the source rather than the
receiving end (INP) about congestion. It's thus suited to terminal-to-host
protocols like SNA that use the sender side of the link for congestion
management.
    ANSI also specifies a third congestion-avoidance mechanism,
Consolidated Link Layer Management (CLLM), which uses a reserved data link
control identifier (DLCI) to send link layer control messages to an INP.
In effect, this is an in-band signaling channel that establishes and
identifies the causes of congestion. To date, it has garnered virtually no
support from vendors.
    All of the foregoing are so-called explicit congestion control
mechanisms. It also is possible to use implicit congestion management,
based, for instance, on delays. Thus, both TCP/IP and DECnet Phase IV nodes
monitor the elapsed time between when a packet is sent and when an
acknowledgment is returned. If no acknowledgment is received within a
specified period, the node first stops sending altogether and then slowly
begins to put packets onto the network, watching to see if they are
acknowledged.
    The ANSI spec also addresses congestion recovery with the Discard
Eligibility (DE) bit. This furnishes a way to identify a permanent virtual
circuit (PVC) on a frame relay network that is causing congestion. If a PVC
exceeds its allotted burst rate (defined when the network is set up) over a
specific period, the frame relay switch sets the DE bit. If the network
starts to experience congestion, it will first drop packets that have the
DE bit set.
    The carriers also are looking to help control congestion with the
Quality Of Service (QOS) definition they supply with frame relay offerings.
A QOS comprises a burst rate, access speed, maximum number of PVCs, and
Committed Information Rate (CIR), the last of which ensures that every
permanent virtual circuit always receives its specified bandwidth.
    There is another--and some might suggest harsher--way to deal with
PVCs that flood a network with packets: Set up tariffs that severely punish
unfair or dangerous network behavior. None of the carriers have chosen this
approach--yet.
    Unfortunately, all of these strategies remain options. So what's a
network planner to do? The most important guideline is to choose an INP
vendor and carrier or frame relay switch supplier in tandem. Make sure that
one knows about and supports the other's approach to frame relay congestion
management. This may soon be simpler than it sounds: There's a growing
trend for carriers to enter into nonexclusive arrangements with INP
vendors. Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.) now has such
arrangements with AT&T, MCI, and US Sprint. Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park,
Calif.) has cut deals with CompuServe, AT&T, and WilTel.
    Right now, frame relay users should expect to see packet loss on
the order of 1 percent to 2 percent of the total sent, pretty much in
keeping with any robust, fully utilized network. It's highly unlikely that
public frame relay networks will collapse as a result of congestion--as
long as the protection afforded by the DE bit is carefully adhered to and
INP vendors implement a range of implicit and explicit management
techniques.

NET MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS: A GOOD PLACE TO START,
A BAD PLACE TO STOP

By:
Bruce Fram

Standards for network management protocols are the mom and apple pie of our
industry. But what isn't clear to many users--and isn't talked about by
many vendors--is what protocols and standards can't do. This isn't
an indictment of any particular protocol--SNMP, OSI, CMIP, NMVT, or the
like. But net management protocols--standard or otherwise--don't address
the entire management issue.
    The truth is, they don't even deal with its most critical aspects.
Network management involves more that just passing information between
devices, which is the role of the protocol. A complete solution also must
encompass the user interface, database models, and application program
interfaces (APIs).
    Yet instead of working on all these issues in concert, many vendors
are content to deliver products that boast pretty interfaces or to supply
protocols bereft of real applications or hooks into other applications. For
instance, of the 40 or so simple network management protocol (SNMP)
management stations on the market, most give users no more than simple
statistics without interpretation. Their big selling point seems to be that
they support one or more of the leading management protocols.
    Beyond nifty graphics, what's needed are databases of information
about network topology, traffic, performance, status, and the like. I'm not
talking about the management information bases (MIBs) for SNMP or the
common management information protocol/services (CMIP/
CMIS). These are meta-definitions or specifications for device-level data.
    At least, I don't mean just that data. I'm also referring tothe
network-wide information that a complete net management system or
application would use. That data is available, although getting at it means
capturing and analyzing packets, which requires the management system to
run some fairly complex calculations.
    But even if a system collects this data, consolidating it, storing
it, representing it, and making it available for reports and further
analysis requires an underlying database far beyond anything typically
available. What's missing are well-defined specifications that actually
spell out the structure of the database and specify the elements it will
contain. For instance, how will routers be represented? How often will
network utilization data be collected? If packets per second are to be
monitored, will they be data packets or broadcast packets?
    The ultimate form a net management database takes will vary
according to need and configuration. But the database and the system it
serves should be able to identify and explain faults in detail and let
users know what corrective action has been taken. What users really want
are reports and suggestions to help with capacity planning and network
design. The last thing they want is to sit in front of a monitor scrolling
through screens of data.

DON'T WAIT FOR DME

    Without common database definitions, vendors and users are severely
limited as to the network management applications they can write. Yet these
applications are the heart of network management: They're what the
interfaces, databases, and protocols exist to serve.
    That's where APIs come into the picture. By giving developers
something common to write to, they make it far simpler to write multivendor
management applications. But developers of net management APIs face
problems familiar to all software engineers: They need standards and
specifications to guide them. If it sounds circular, it is: Developers of
standard APIs themselves need clearly defined standards. Only when both
pieces of the puzzle are in place can third parties and network managers
create truly useful applications.
    The Open Software Foundation (OSF, Cambridge, Mass.) may have an
answer in its Distributed Management Environment (DME). But it's too early
to tell if its recently selected technologies will do the job or if many
net management vendors will support it. And what will happen to existing
vendor APIs is an open question.
    Meanwhile, users desperately need ways to manage multivendor
distributed networks--today. It's time users began putting the pressure on
vendors for network management tools that fit together and do the job. If
they don't vote with their pocketbooks, they'll pay the price downstream.
    For their part, vendors need to start developing
protocol-independent, value-added applications. Graphical maps make for
great demonstrations, but most don't have the depth to back those first
impressions. We need to begin defining standards for user interfaces,
database models, and APIs--as well as for management protocols.

HSSI SIZZLES
But distributed bandwidth demonstrates
there's more to the high-speed serial interface
than just speed

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Now that far-flung LANs and mainframes regularly communicate with distant
sites and data centers, network managers are increasingly concerned that
interfaces to the wide area are becoming bottlenecks, costing them speed
and bandwidth. Router, multiplexer, and channel extender suppliers say they
have an answer in HSSI, the high-speed serial interface that's now starting
to appear in products.
    According to HSSI advocates, such interfaces as V.35 and RS-422
aren't fast enough to connect multiple LANs and mainframe channels at full
speed to T3 access devices. A T3 pipe delivers 45 Mbit/s of bandwidth;
Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) and the Synchronous Optical
Network (Sonet) will be even faster. V.35 was originally intended to
support no more than 6 Mbit/s, and RS-422 tops out at 10 Mbit/s.
    HSSI, as its boosters to point out, operates at up to 52 Mbit/s.
Perhaps even more importantly, it gives users a way to allocate all the
available bandwidth as needed among HSSI-compliant data terminal equipment
(DTE)--computers, routers, channel extenders, peripherals, and so on. These
devices are connected to HSSI multiplexers or channel/data service units
(CSU/DSUs), which in turn establish links to the wide area.
    Although no one device is likely to need the full bandwidth of,
say, a T3 pipe, HSSI makes it possible to allocate the T3's 45 Mbit/s among
different DTE. V.35 and RS-422 are not designed to allocate bandwidth. For
instance, a single HSSI port on a T3 multiplexer could support six router
connections. In contrast, six V.35 interfaces would be needed to link the
same six routers.
    HSSI defines a physical and electrical interface between DTE and
data communications equipment (DCE). It was originally developed by Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) and T3plus Networking Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.). The two vendors submitted it to the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) TR30.1 committee about a year ago. TR30.1 also developed
EIA-232 and V.35. HSSI's ratification is expected sometime in 1992,
according to members of TR30.1. They say the HSSI specification is not
likely to be changed significantly between now and its adoption. A number
of vendors already support HSSI, and more are expected to sign on (see
table).
    Changes in the way LANs and mainframes are used--and in the way
that the local area is viewed--are driving HSSI's acceptance. Database
systems, for instance, commonly require exchanges to take place over the
wide area as fast as if the communicating computers and resources were
located on the same physical LAN. Only a high-speed service such as T3 or
Sonet in conjunction with HSSI lets LAN speeds be maintained fully.
    What's more, as companies consolidate data centers, high-speed
links are needed to tie in mainframes at remote sites, says Richard Farmer,
product manager at Adaptive Corp. (Redwood City, Calif.). He also notes
that remote backup computers used during disaster recovery need high-speed
links to the data center.
    Also pushing HSSI along is the growing use of high-speed storage
devices, such as disk farms and tape silos (large rooms filled with
computer tapes that are accessed by robots in response to requests from
computers). This sort of storage demands high-speed mainframe channel
extension, according to Walt Hinton, product manager at McData Corp.
(Broomfield, Colo.). Mainframe operating systems that allow multiple
computers to work as one, such as IBM's Enterprise Systems Architecture
(ESA), also mandate high-speed links, he adds.
    HSSI's strong suit is distributed bandwidth. McData's 5300 HSSI
System, for instance, allocates user-specified portions of the T3 pipe to
each router, printer, and host (see Figure 1). Thus, the 5300 at Site B
allocates 10 Mbit/s to the router, 24 Mbit/s to the remote disk farm, 6
Mbit/s to the printer, and 2 Mbit/s to the PBX.
    The 5300 consists of a T3 multiplexer with HSSI interfaces and a
channel extender housed in the same cabinet. The channel extender, used in
this case to support the disk farm and printer at Site B, is connected to
the T3 multiplexer through the latter's HSSI interface. The router and PBX
at Site B also are connected to the multiplexer's HSSI interfaces.
    Specifically, HSSI makes it possible to allocate bandwidth by
establishing how routers or other DTE accept clocking from an external
source at speeds ranging from 1.5 to 52 Mbit/s. Network clocks are
typically derived from a central source (usually a clock maintained by the
providers of public network services) and passed along to all devices on a
network so that the beginnings and ends of blocks, messages, and frames can
be identified clearly.
    In most vendors' implementations of HSSI, bandwidth must be
allocated manually by the network manager to the devices connected to the
DCE. In fact, HSSI does not now specify a way for bandwidth to be allocated
dynamically.
    Dynamic allocation is obviously desirable because it eliminates the
work associated with specifying how much bandwidth a router or channel
extender is to receive. More importantly, it improves network performance
by accommodating bursty applications and users who come on-line with
bandwidth-hungry applications without warning.
    Some vendors, such as Newbridge Networks Inc. (Herndon, Va.), have
devised proprietary schemes that allow their HSSI multiplexers to allocate
bandwidth dynamically. Newbridge uses simple network management protocol
(SNMP) messages to enable routers and channel extenders to signal
multiplexers that additional bandwidth is needed. Most vendors agree,
however, that it makes far more sense for HSSI's backers to work together
to extend HSSI or devise a standard approach to dynamic allocation.
    HSSI also does not specify how multiplexers or similar devices are
to transmit data over the wide area. Most vendors' equipment gathers data
from attached networking gear and sends it as one DS-3 stream over a public
data service. DS-3 specifies 44.736 Mbit/s; T3, Sonet, and SMDS all accept
DS-3 as an input.
    When configured in a mesh network, multiplexers typically send the
DS-3 stream over the best possible route available at the time of
transmission. If that route fails, the data can be rerouted onto another
network link that furnishes a path to the destination.
    Once the DS-3 stream arrives at the receiving DCE, it is broken
down and specific data is sent to the appropriate devices (hosts, channel
extenders, routers, printers, PBXs, disk farms, and the like).
    Adaptive and T3plus have taken this basic approach one step
further. They allow data streams from individual devices connected to the
same HSSI interface to be routed to different destinations, over both T1
and T3 communications lines.
    Adaptive has implemented HSSI for its Sonet Transmission Manager,
or STM (see Figure 2). The switching facility maps a data stream coming
from a HSSI interface into multiple DS-1 channels. DS-1 specifies
1.544-Mbit/s transmissions.
    The STM's matrix switch can either combine DS-1s to transmit a DS-3
data stream or transmit separate DS-1 channels over multiple T1 lines
rather than one T3. In the latter case, the DS-1s are reassembled into a
DS-3 by the receiving STM, so data can be routed through the receiving
STM's HSSI interface to the appropriate device.
    Adaptive's and T3plus's ability to use multiple low-speed lines to
form a high-bandwidth link between two nodes gives users three additional
benefits. First, it allows network nodes to be installed in areas where
high-speed facilities may not yet be available. Second, it adds fault
tolerance, since more links can be established between nodes. Priorities
also can be established among HSSI connections to ensure immediate
recovery in the event of a network failure.
    Third, any one HSSI port connected to the STM's matrix switch
actually has more bandwidth available than would be provided by a single
DS-3. For example, it is possible for a router and host to be connected to
a remote router and host over both a T3 and a T1 line. Together, the T3 and
T1 deliver more bandwidth between two STMs than would a single T3. The
bottleneck in an STM network thus becomes the HSSI interface itself rather
than the T3 line.
    HSSI's place as the preferred interface to high-speed
communications lines seems secure. But not everyone is sold on HSSI. Some
vendors point out that although it was originally designed for 6-Mbit/s
transmissions, V.35 can be pressed into faster service.
    Network Systems Corp. (NSC, Minneapolis), for example, uses V.35
interfaces in its supercomputer connection equipment and routers to provide
access to T3 transmission equipment at up to 40 Mbit/s. ''There is no
advantage to HSSI over V.35,'' asserts Bill Way, product marketing manager
at NSC.
    HSSI proponents disagree. While it's true that multiple V.35s can
be made to access T3, HSSI provides better electrical characteristics,
according to Jim Michaels, vice president of network planning at
Newbridge.
    Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.) intends to support
HSSI but doesn't believe the interface offers real benefits today. HSSI is
only an electrical interface. What is most important is having the
processing power to move packets at the speed the interface allows, says
Richard Yates, product marketing manager. Another prerequisite is off-the-
shelf HDLC controller chips that support HSSI speeds, says Yates. Until
these are shipped, HSSI interfaces, he maintains, will be expensive.

CANNED HELP FOR LAN PROBLEMS: EFFECTIVE, BUT LIMITED
Expert systems from HP and Network General can solve some LAN problems
fast, but they can't be fine-tuned

By:
Mary Jander

When they're at their best, expert systems offer the collective wisdom of a
team of first-rate troubleshooters--without the high salaries, ego clashes,
and other fringe benefits such groups tend to engender. The expert systems
unveiled recently by two leading LAN protocol analyzer vendors work more
like second-line technicians: They do a good job of handling problems that
are familiar to them, but they can't be trained to try different approaches
or to handle new problems.
    Both Network Advisor from Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Colorado
Telecommunications Division (Colorado Springs, Colo.) and Expert Sniffer
from Network General Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.) can detect, diagnose, and
solve such LAN problems as duplicate addresses, cable breaks, and improper
node insertions in a matter of minutes. That not only saves LAN
administrators time and effort, but it also allows them to focus their
attention on other management issues.
    The down side to both packages, at least for now, is that the
canned wisdom they hold cannot be added to or altered. HP and Network
General enlisted the help of teams of network experts to develop their
respective knowledge bases for LAN troubleshooting, but users can't change
those knowledge bases to meet their specific needs. HP has indicated that
it plans to give users the power to add logic to its expert system, but a
delivery date for that addition has not been announced.
    The inability to customize the knowledge bases limits the utility
of both packages and has some users and competing vendors wondering whether
expert LAN analyzers are worth the trouble and expense to install at this
point. One beta user of Expert Sniffer reports that although the expert
system can uncover some critical flaws in the network, it also wastes time
tracking and solving problems that either aren't important or aren't
correctable, such as intermittent packet storms. Others note that some of
the expert analyzers' troubleshooting features already are available in
products like the LANalyzer from Novell Inc.'s LANalyzer Products Division
(San Jose, Calif.).

EXPERTS AT WORK

    HP's Network Advisor, which began shipping this past summer,
comprises an HP 4970 LAN protocol analyzer and Fault Finder expert-systems
software. Network General announced and demonstrated its Expert Sniffer in
September; the product will ship sometime in the first half of next year
and will be made available as an upgrade to users of the vendor's Sniffer
analyzer.
    The two products are in the same general price range. A Network
Advisor capable of handling both Ethernet and token ring LANs costs
$25,500. When it becomes available, Expert Sniffer will cost from $12,500
to $24,000, depending on whether users buy a card-only analyzer or a
complete platform including a portable computer. In contrast, Novell's
LANalyzer costs $12,500 for a board and software that handles either
Ethernet or token ring and $19,980 for a package that handles both LAN
types.
    Network Advisor and Expert Sniffer have many features in common.
Both work with Ethernet and token ring networks. Both invoke the expert
system as a function of the analyzer, treating the expert system like
another type of decoding program. In addition to providing media access
control (MAC)-layer troubleshooting, the expert systems use the decoding
functions of their respective analyzers to report on problems in
upper-layer protocols. For instance, if a file transfer can't be completed
because of a faulty packet, Expert Sniffer reports the problem to the user,
according to Network General. Among the protocols handled by both expert
analyzers are TCP/IP, DECnet, and Internet Packet Exchange (IPX). Neither
system handles WAN protocols.
    HP built its Fault Finder expert system with Smalltalk, a set of
DOS-compatible development tools from Digitalk Inc. (Los Angeles). In HP's
scheme, analyzer functions, such as decode tests, statistical monitoring
programs, and diagnostic tests, are organized in such a way that they can
be activated automatically in response to certain queries and hypotheses
posed by the expert system. As various hypotheses are tested, they lead to
more tests or to final decisions, which are posted graphically or in text
form on Network Advisor's display (see figure).
    For example, if a network technician is having trouble inserting a
new node onto a Novell NetWare token ring, he or she can activate Fault
Finder, which then tests the LAN for broken transmit or receive wires and
checks for responses from all network interface cards on the ring. If the
wires are intact and all other stations are responding, the system then
checks for other possible causes, such as an incorrect speed setting on the
network card in the new node.
    The initial version of Fault Finder uses what is known as a
rule-based approach to expert systems. In the rule-based approach, the
expert system's code contains hypotheses and solutions for each type of LAN
problem for each possible set of circumstances. In a sense, rule-based
expert-systems code can be thought of as containing an exhaustive list of
''if-then'' statements.
    In contrast, Expert Sniffer uses what Network General calls a
blackboard approach. The vendor says its expert system continually gathers
and sifts certain information about the network, such as routing paths,
applications, protocols, station types, and user names. The expert system
uses this information to create a problem matrix that enables it to
pinpoint problems without running through the gamut of possibilities
required by a rule-based system. Network General claims Expert Sniffer's
''learning'' capabilities make it more adaptable to individual networks. HP
says it will add a similar self-learning feature to Network Advisor in an
upgrade scheduled to be released this month.

KNOWLEDGE LIMITS

    The inability to modify the knowledge base of either Network Advisor
or Expert Sniffer can be particularly frustrating for users. Because of
this inflexibility, users can't add their own expertise to the analyzer or
modify the analyzer's responses to reflect specific networking
requirements.
    HP reportedly is investigating a way to let users add to Network
Advisor's knowledge base without disturbing its structure. Network General,
however, has announced no plans to let users alter Expert Sniffer's
knowledge base.
    Although users of either system can't alter the information in the
knowledge base, they can make some adjustments to the parameters the
systems measure. To set the thresholds or levels of packet activity
monitored by the system, Network Advisor users can exit the system and edit
an ASCII file containing that information. The edited file then is loaded
into the analyzer. Expert Sniffer's main menu offers users the option of
entering such data via an electronic form.
    One test user of Network General's Expert Sniffer gives the product
a qualified endorsement for LAN troubleshooting. Dell Holmes, lead analyst
in the computer technology services division of Halliburton Corp.
(Arlington, Texas), an engineering and construction conglomerate, says the
product can help save time for highly skilled technicians who already use
Sniffers to troubleshoot LAN problems. Instead of having to list a range of
hypotheses and test them systematically, technicians can activate Expert
Sniffer from the main Sniffer menu. According to Holmes, Expert Sniffer can
cut the time it takes to diagnose certain problems from hours to minutes.

PROS AND CONS

    While HP and Network General move ahead with their expert
analyzers, some other vendors hope to release expert products of their own
in the near future. Lexcel (formerly Micro Technology Inc., Fullerton,
Calif.) says it plans to add expert-systems technology to its Lance+
analyzer, which uses Novell's LANtern monitoring device to gather
information on packet activity in multiple LAN segments.
    The latest release of Lance+ has a fault-determination feature that
correlates the measurements taken by the network monitor with information
in Lance+'s relational database. This technique helps to locate the causes
of network problems more precisely, Lexcel says. With older versions of
Lance, when a hub caused a problem on a LAN segment, all the devices
attached to the hub were turned red on the monitor's graphical display.
With the new feature, only the hub turns red on the display. The addition
of an expert system will streamline this procedure even more: Instead of
having to activate a fault-detection program to get information about
problems, users will be notified automatically that a problem has occurred
and how it can be solved.
    Other vendors are acting as though they aren't convinced that
expert systems are the answer for LAN analyzers and monitoring gear.
Novell's LANalyzer Products Division, ProTools Inc. (Beaverton, Ore.), and
Spider Systems Inc. (Burlington, Mass.) all say they are considering adding
expert systems to their analyzers, but they provide only sketchy
information as to when and how they'll do so.
    Novell, in fact, points out that some features offered by the new
expert analyzers are already available in products like its LANalyzer.
LANalyzer's Automated Troubleshooting System lets users automate the steps
to be taken if certain types of network problems occur. For instance, if
performance degrades, the Automated Troubleshooting System can activate a
series of tests that check how many packets of which protocol are running
on the LAN. The system contains a template that users can call up from the
main menu to specify network conditions or thresholds at which certain
types of tests should be activated. Users can choose specific tests and
test sequences for each situation; they also can create new tests or alter
existing ones, Novell says.

SECOND OPINIONS

    Some industry developments could complement or even replace the
functions that expert systems provide to LAN analyzers and monitors. The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is now working on a simple network
management protocol (SNMP) management information base (MIB) that could
speed the addition of expert systems to LAN analyzers and monitors. The new
MIB, called the remote monitoring (RMON) MIB, not only will set up a means
for transmitting information from analyzers and monitors to SNMP management
stations but also will specify a way for SNMP coding to direct the
automatic testing of LANs by analyzers or monitors.
    In this case, expert systems could be added to existing SNMP
management stations rather than to LAN analyzers or monitors. Several
vendors that sell both LAN analyzers and SNMP management stations,
including HP, Lexcel, Network General, Novell, ProTools, and Spider, are
active on the IETF's RMON MIB committee, and all of them claim to be in the
process of adding support for the RMON MIB to their products.

BBN GREEN LIGHTS BUSLESS SWITCH
Emerald's high-speed switching module hits 160 Mbit/s full duplex for
aggregate throughput in the gigabit range

By:
Johna Till Johnson

BBN Communications thinks buses are just fine for crosstown traffic, but
they really don't belong inside corporate backbone processors. That's why
the venerable high-tech vendor has gone busless with Emerald, its recently
announced next-generation architecture for cell switching.
    Instead of a bus, BBN has come up with a switching module that
delivers port-to-port connectivity at 160 Mbit/s in full-duplex mode,
yielding an aggregate switching speed of several gigabits per second.
    Most of today's switches are built around buses, as are the
majority of multiplexers, computers, and microprocessor-based products. But
for very fast data transfers, even a high-speed bus can turn into a
bottleneck.
    Going busless is something of a family trait at BBN. Its parent
company, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.), developed a
concurrent supercomputer, the Butterfly, based on a similar busless
design.
    BBN clearly is hoping that its new architecture, which won't see
light as a product until late next year, will make the company as
successful with cell switches as it has been in the X.25 packet-switch
market, where it is a leading player.
    Assuming it can build a workable product, BBN then must decide
whether to license the technology to others or sell it itself.
    Building an Emerald cell switch might seem to make sense at first,
but some observers point out that the demand for cell switches may not be
strong until the end of this decade, which would keep the architecture out
of use for several years. If the company were to license the technology,
however, parts of it could be appearing in routers and multiplexers--as
well as switches--as early as the end of next year.
    Joaquin Gonzalez, vice president and service director for global
networking strategies at the Meta Group Inc. (Westport, Conn.), is among
those who see cell switching in the wide area decidedly in the future
tense--possibly as late as 1997. Gonzalez thinks cell relay won't catch on
in the U.S. until there is an application driving it, such as
desktop-to-desktop multimedia. That's why he thinks BBN should license the
technology to internetworking vendors, which would bring it to market much
faster.
    Potential users for an Emerald product include companies with large
networking needs, particularly carriers and alternative carriers, says
Robert Bellman, vice president of marketing for BBN. Fortune 100 companies
are another good bet, since many of their applications--such as tying
together fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) networks across the wide
area, imaging, and transporting isochronous voice and data--require a great
deal of bursty bandwidth.
    ''Cell switching in the kind of product we're developing is the
only technology that can handle bursty traffic and be efficient at the same
time,'' says Mark Lunardoni, a product line manager at BBN.

DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

    Its busless design enables Emerald to handle the high speeds
inherent in cell switching. Bob Hinden, senior technologist at BBN, points
out that because it's a shared resource, a bus acts as a bottleneck in the
data flow. Whenever one subsystem--say, a line card or processor--wants to
transmit data, it asks for sole access to the bus. This means other
subsystems must wait until the first one finishes before they can send
data. At low throughputs, it's possible to make the bus much faster than
the port connections. This isn't feasible, however, at multimegabit or
gigabit speeds.
    Another drawback with a bus-based architecture is that it's not
inherently scalable. As more subsystems are added, performance drops
because each subsystem must contend with the others to gain access to the
bus. The more subsystems, the greater the contention and the longer average
wait before any given subsystem gets the bus.
    In the Emerald approach, each line card accesses the switch
directly, so there are always full-bandwidth paths between cards on the
switch (see figure). Adding line cards doesn't reduce the performance,
because cards aren't in competition for the bandwidth.
    Key to the success of this approach is distributed
processing--putting intelligence on the line cards as well as in the
central processor. The line cards have two functions: They convert incoming
data to 53-byte cells (Emerald uses 53-byte cells with a 48-byte payload,
the standard size for asynchronous transfer mode), and they forward the
cells along the appropriate paths.
    Most cells traverse the switch without ever using the central
processor, which is thus freed to handle global issues, such as management
and flow setup. When a line card receives a packet of data, it parses the
header to determine where it's going. If there is an existing path (or
flow), the line card breaks the packet into cells and forwards the cells
along it. If not, the line card alerts the processor, which establishes a
new flow.
    Most cells travel along an established flow, says Hinden, which
means the burden of packet processing shifts from the processor to the line
cards.
    The combination of busless architecture and distributed processing
makes Emerald scalable and modular. Line cards can be added without slowing
performance; the switch module also can be upgraded. BBN won't give
specifics on the number of line cards that can be accommodated or what the
switch module can be upgraded to. Nonetheless, scalability is good news for
potential users. It means they can purchase a smaller version of the
switch, then upgrade as needs grow and budget permits. (BBN also is not
releasing pricing details.)
    A final feature of Emerald's is its ability to connect to LANs.
Although BBN again is keeping mum about specifics, some line cards will
connect to token ring, Ethernet, and FDDI. The design also will include
frame relay interfaces.

WOLLONGONG BUYS A EUROPEAN CUSTOMER BASE

The Wollongong Group Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.) has acquired a majority stake
in network integrator European Network Engineering (ENE, Brussels, Belgium)
with an eye toward providing networks that use Wollongong's Unix, VMS,
Apple Macintosh, Sun, and TCP/IP connectivity software on a range of
workstations, routers, bridges, cabling, and other networking devices
supplied by ENE. Wollongong won't disclose the exact size of its share in
ENE, but says it is greater than 50 percent. For Wollongong, ENE's chief
attraction is its customer base, which includes British Rail and the U.K.
divisions of Price Waterhouse and KPMG, formerly Peat Marwick. Wollongong
says it anticipates ENE's revenues, now about $5 million annually, to grow
by 40 percent to 50 percent as a result of the arrangement. Wollongong's
revenues, now at about $30 million annually, also are expected to grow.

SOUTH AFRICAN COMPANY PULLS OUT OF TIMEPLEX/ASCOM DEAL

Ascom Holding AG (Bern, Switzerland) has completed its purchase of network
equipment maker Timeplex Inc. (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.) from computer maker
Unisys Corp. (Blue Bell, Pa.). Originally, Unisys announced that Timeplex
would be purchased by a joint venture involving Ascom and Mercedes
Information Technologies Pty. Ltd. (MIT, Johannesburg, South Africa). MIT
pulled out of the deal, however, and Ascom now owns all of Timeplex. MIT
cited South African government regulations on foreign investment as the
reason for its withdrawal, but analysts suspect that the change has more to
do with Ascom's desire for sole ownership and its uncertainty about how
Timeplex would be managed by two owners. ''The thought of trying to control
Timeplex proved a little more hairy than anyone wanted,'' says Jim
Harrison, program director for global network strategies at the Meta Group
Inc. (Westport, Conn.), a market research firm.

AT&T CUTSLONG-DISTANCE T1 AND FRACTIONAL T1 PRICES. . .

AT&T has filed tariff revisions that would lower the cost of long-haul T1
and fractional T1 circuits. The changes, which will take effect this month
pending Federal Communications Commission approval, will affect monthly
rates for Accunet T1.5 services, Accunet Spectrum of Digital Services
(ASDS), and Voice Grade Private Line (VGPL) services. Accunet T1.5 prices
will rise for short-haul circuits and fall for long-haul T1 and fractional
T1 lines. The crossover point from increases to reductions occurs for
circuits longer than 150 miles. T1 service from New Jersey to California,
for example, falls from roughly $19,000 to roughly $17,000 per month;
384-kbit/s fractional T1 service on the same link drops from around $7,000
per month to around $5,500.

AT&T CUTS LONG-DISTANCE T1 AND FRACTIONAL T1 PRICES. . .WHILE MCI PRICES
SWITCHED T1, T3 SERVICES

MCI Communications Corp. (Washington, D.C.) announced prices for its
switched T1 and T3 services. The services, offered under MCI's Virtual
Private Data Services (VPDS) plan, are the first such offerings from any
carrier. Prices for switched T1 service begin at $2.50 for the first 30
seconds and $0.20 for every six seconds thereafter, for an hourly cost of
$121.50 on circuits of 55 miles or less. Pricing increases with distance to
a maximum of $4.10 for the first 30 seconds and $0.37 for each six seconds
thereafter for circuits longer than 1,910 miles. Prices for the switched T3
service begin at $37.50 for the first 30 seconds and $3.00 for every six
seconds thereafter on circuits of 55 miles or less.

ATM FORUM TO PROMOTE INTEROPERABILITY

A forum dedicated to the further development and implementation of
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) specifications was founded last month. The
ATM Forum (San Jose, Calif.) aims to develop a specification for a
permanent virtual circuit ATM interface. ATM is a form of switching that
carries data in small, fixed-length packets called cells. The forum's
interface specification, expected to be available next spring, will allow
companies to design interoperable ATM products and services. Standards
governing ATM transport already have been developed by the CCITT and ANSI.
The forum's goal is not to contest these standards or to set itself up as a
rival standards body, but to ensure that standards are implemented by
equipment vendors and service providers, according to Charlie Giancarlo, a
founder of Adaptive Corp. (Redwood City, Calif.) and a charter member of
the forum. At press time, other members included Northern Telecom
(Mississauga, Ontario), Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.), and US
Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas City, Mo.). Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.) and Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.)
reportedly are interested in joining the forum.

DIRECT FAX LINKS PLANNED FOR DOS, WINDOWS, AND UNIX

Thanks to an impending standard, users soon may be able to fax documents
directly from word processing or spreadsheet applications running under
DOS, Microsoft Windows, or Unix. FaxBios, an application program interface
(API) from the FaxBios Association (Berkeley, Calif.), a vendor consortium,
is the first standard to cover multiple operating systems. Initially,
FaxBios will work only under DOS, but later releases will support Unix and
Windows. An earlier standard, the Communicating Applications Specification
(CAS), allowed documents to be faxed from an application, but only under
DOS. ''For a company like WordPerfect, only supporting DOS is an
unrecoverable flaw--we just can't be limited to one operating system,''
says Richard Holder, manager of peripheral products for the Corporate Lab
of WordPerfect Corp. (Orem, Utah) and information officer for the FaxBios
Association. Association members include Hewlett-Packard Co. (Palo Alto,
Calif.), Everex Systems Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), and Biscom Inc. (Billerica,
Mass.).

OSPF GETS SEAL OF APPROVAL

The open shortest path first (OSPF) routing protocol drew a major
endorsement over its rival, dual intermediate system-to-intermediate
system (IS-IS), from the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). The
IESG, which until now has given equal footing to the two protocols,
recommended that OSPF be made mandatory for all TCP/IP routers. ''We've
put the official gold star of approval on OSPF,'' says Noel Chiappa, area
director for the Internet. Vendors can still offer dual IS-IS, but they
must support OSPF as well.

SNMP MANAGEMENT FOR PROTOCOL ANALYZERS

Users may soon be able to use the simple network management protocol (SNMP)
to manage their network analyzers. The Internet Engineering Steering Group
(IESG) has recommended that a remote monitoring (RMON) management
information base (MIB) be advanced to proposed standard status. The RMON
MIB defines the SNMP values collected by analyzers. Several vendors already
are said to be using prototypes of the RMON MIB. Actual products could be
released as early as next year.

VIEWING THE FUTURE
FROM INTEROP

By:
Joseph Braue, Editor in Chief

Trade journalists must have a streak of fortune teller in the blood, given
how we love to try to predict where the industry is headed. But at last
month's Interop, I thought I'd give my crystal ball a rest. Instead, I
quizzed several of the industry's top execs as to what they think the big
stories will be over the next two years.
    For Frank Gratzer, a Bellcore division manager and point man for
the Baby Bells' Switched Multimegabit Data Service rollouts, the future is
SMDS. Plans now call for tariffed SMDS by the end of '92 or early '93 in 30
cities. With Bell Atlantic quoting a flat $500 monthly fee and an $800
installation charge per site, SMDS is starting to make sense for companies
with three or four sites in a metropolitan area that need to be connected.
    Eric Benhamou, president and CEO of 3Com Corp., sees SMDS, frame
relay, ISDN, and Switched 56 as technologies whose time is at hand. He
believes such services will reduce the number of WAN ports that bridges and
routers must pack, paving the way for cheaper, smaller internetworking
gear. Will corporations trust mission-critical data to carriers? Benhamou
says over time they will.
    The future of intelligent wiring hubs lies with cell relay,
according to Ralph Ungermann and Andy Ludwick, who are president and CEO,
respectively, of Ungermann-Bass Inc. and SynOptics Communications Inc.
Faster LANs (thanks to FDDI) and higher-bandwidth applications will push
hubs to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology.
    Routers look to be headed for some interesting times, since three
of the industry's top execs are stressing different trends. Wellfleet's
Paul Severino, president of Wellfleet Communications Inc., sees 1992 as
more network management and deeper integration of internetworking
functions. John Morgridge, president of Cisco Systems Inc., looks to the
coming year as a time for further integrating SNA and increasing the
emphasis on low-end sales. And Patrick Courtin, president of Proteon Inc.,
sees users creating enterprise-wide applications on top of internetworking
devices and teaching staff to support them.
    Who's right? As soon as we know, you'll know. And you won't need a
crystal ball, either.

TRANSATLANTIC
DIAL-UP LINKS:
STILL HIT OR MISS

By:
Tom Mangan, Lead Technologies

In real-world data communications, the whole often is less than the sum of
its parts. This lesson in mathematical illogic is painfully evident to
anyone who tries to establish transatlantic data links using dial-up lines.
The fiber optic cables that now cross the Atlantic have vastly improved the
line quality for voice calls, while advancements in modems have pushed the
speed envelope for data transmissions over domestic dial-up lines. Somehow,
however, these two developments have not added up to reliable, consistent
dial-up data communications.
    Of course, a few years ago no one would have even tried to set up a
dial-up data connection across the big pond. Most of the dial-up links
between the U.S. and Europe--for that matter, most intercontinental
links--were carried by satellite service. The echo, delay, and other random
noise associated with satellite transmissions made trying to establish
anything other than a low-speed (300- or 1,200-bit/s) data connection
virtually impossible. Most users turned to leased lines or X.25 services
for transatlantic data exchanges. Others put disks or tapes in pouches and
sent them via overnight delivery services.
    The arrival of transatlantic fiber cables TAT-8 and PTAT-1 gave
hope that reliable dial-up data links had arrived. But a recent project to
set up such connections has taught me otherwise.
    Our project involved connecting two IBM AS/400 computers, one in
the U.S. and one in the U.K., on an occasional basis for a client. The
AS/400 on the client's U.S. side (in Langhorne, Pa.) provides program
development and operational support to the U.K. system, located in
Tunbridge, Kent, about 100 miles outside of London. The client wanted the
U.S. AS/400 tobe able to dial up the U.K. machine and establish a
synchronous SNA Logical Unit 6.2 link.
    We considered using X.25 for the link, but ruled that option out
quickly because of cost. X.25 access charges in the U.K. are on the
prohibitive side. So we decided on the next obvious option, international
direct dial-up lines.
    At first, we used V.32 modems from two different manufacturers. We
chose to let SNA take care of error detection and correction. After some
tweaking of the modems and software, we were able to establish a dial-up
connection between the U.S. and the U.K.--but our success rate was only
about 20 percent. The other 80 percent of the time, we would get as far as
hearing the U.K. modem answer the call, only to have the U.S. modem drop
the line. When we did establish a link, we could maintain the line at 4.8
kbit/s, but 9.6 kbit/s was chancy. We tried adjusting the modems and
software further to improve our success rate, but to no avail.
    We then decided to replace the modems we were using with a matched
set from a single manufacturer. After adjusting the new modems, our success
rate improved from 20 percent to 60 percent. A 60 percent completion rate
is fine for a quarterback, but for corporate networkers it's disastrous.
    Our next move was to check the quality of the circuits. The
client's carrier on the U.S. side is AT&T. I had noticed that although most
voice calls to the U.K. site had good sound quality and lacked delay
characteristics, the calls were half duplex. Also, when a call was
established, the line emitted what can best be described as a
high-frequency glitch before the conversation could begin. Another factor
that began to be apparent was that starting around 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time,
the chances of getting a clean line for data decreased rapidly.
    We wondered why, with all the fiber optic circuits now linking the
U.S. and Europe, transatlantic connections were so unlike placing a call
within the U.S. We also wondered about using AT&T's Global Software Defined
Network (GSDN)--the client is an AT&T SDN user and was considering using
GSDN for placing calls to the U.K. site. In the U.S., SDN is primarily a
pricing mechanism; SDN calls use the same facilities as the rest of the
AT&T customer base. Would using GSDN make any difference?
    Armed with all these questions, we contacted AT&T for some help.
This turned out to be quite an adventure on its own. One AT&T
representative told us that overseas data rates were still limited to 300
to 1,200 bit/s. But a rep from AT&T Paradyne told us that AT&T Paradyne had
run several successful overseas dial-up tests with its modems at speeds up
to 14.4 kbit/s. The caveat for our project was that these tests were
conducted with sites located within major cities. We asked about test
results covering outlying areas, but such tests didn't seem to exist.
    No one we contacted at AT&T was able to provide a good, firm
technical explanation as to why we couldn't establish reliable dial-up
calls with the U.K. site. We speculated that since our location was in a
small town outside of London, the switching of the call through older
central offices in the U.K. might be the cause of the problem. Also, as
traffic built during the morning, the carrier might be switching some
traffic over older facilities (or even satellite) across the Atlantic.
    Research into the use of GSDN gave us some hope. AT&T works with
British Telecommunications PLC's version of SDN, called FeatureNet. This
service uses only one switching point in the U.K., which means we could run
an access line from our site to the FeatureNet node to bypass any older
central offices. Also, AT&T claimed that about 90 percent of the calls
placed with GSDN would travel on fiber facilities. And GSDN's product
specifications indicated that the network would support dial-up data rates
of 4.8 kbit/s, with 9.6 kbit/s ''permissive.''
    For now, our client will use dial-up lines with matched modems,
until a GSDN line is installed at the U.K. site. GSDN won't be a
cheapsolution: A FeatureNet access line now costs about $1,000 per quarter
(not counting usage). But it may be worth it if the success rate
increases.
    This adventure--or misadventure--has only reinforced my belief that
long-distance dial-up data communications is a hit-or-miss proposition.
Within the U.S., we have improved the odds with lots of fiber optic
facilities and better modems. But the odds are less favorable on the
international front, even though intercontintental transmission facilities
are improving rapidly. The odds won't get better until the local
infrastructures improve.
    Although AT&T didn't exactly distinguish itself on this project, I
doubt that the other U.S. carriers could have done any better. There isn't
much that any carrier can do when a call from its network is delivered to a
country that hasn't upgraded its local transmission and switching
facilities. Data calls to large cities stand a better chance of being
completed, but watch out in the outlying areas.
    Users who need to set up occasional international data
transmissions should first explore X.25. For small file transfers,
international public electronic-mail services are another option.
    If dial-up lines are the best alternative, a couple of steps may
help improve the odds on getting connections that work. The first is to
install matched modems from the same manufacturer--no small feat given the
government approvals required for equipment. That will allow you to do
''matched tweaking'' on obscure options such as turn around time,
disconnect signals, and the like. Another is to explore any advantages that
might be obtained from global virtual voice network services.
    One more word of advice: Keep the telephone number of your
overnight delivery service handy.

LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION . . . BREAKING INTO VIDEOCONFERENCING

By:
J.T.J.

Videoconferencing's recent drop in price and increased picture quality make
it a very appealing technology. But before network managers shout ''Roll
cameras'' or shell out any money for a system, they should consider the
following:
    Ann Earon, president of Telemanagement Resources International
(TRI, Lake Wylie, S.C.) advises: ''If you don't know what your needs are,
there's no point in buying technology.'' She suggests network managers find
out who within their companies needs videoconferencing, what kind of
technology is required, and where and how it's likely to be used. Then, she
says, ''set a benchmark for success,'' a way to determine whether the
videoconferencing system actually is helping the company. TRI designs
corporate videoconferencing systems and conducts seminars in this and other
telecommunications technologies.
    Success, she notes, can initially be measured by how often the
equipment is used. Another measurement can be travel dollars saved or
increased productivity.
    William Ray, director of communications network services for
Corning Inc. (Corning, N.Y.), points out that he took an active role in
finding out just who in his company could benefit from videoconferencing
and pumping up the technology. Before going ahead with a company-wide
installation, he found an executive willing to spend money from his own
budget to install a system. Ray paid for one unit and the executive paid
for the other.
    Ray set up a pilot system, and the executive started to realize his
project was being finished faster than planned. Meanwhile, Ray used the
pilot system as a live demonstration for other employees. ''Once people
could see the benefit, it started finding its way into other operating
units.'' Corning Inc. now has videoconferencing sites at its central
headquarters and at plants throughout the United States and in Tokyo.
    Ron Stevenson, the program manager for telecommunications at
General Electric Co.'s Corporate Information Technology division
(Fairfield, Conn.), tells a similar story. GE has had a videoconferencing
network in place for the past two and a half years. It links over 50 sites
across the United States and overseas and is tied into videoconferencing
networks at other companies.
    Before installing the network, Stevenson says, he distributed a
questionnaire asking employees about their meeting and travel habits. He
stresses that he didn't ask employees their opinions regarding
videoconferencing per se. Stevenson analyzed his data to see where
videoconferencing would save on travel costs and increase productivity. He
later wrote a company-wide guide about videoconferencing that gives
detailed breakdowns of the costs of trips and meetings and demonstrates how
and when videoconferencing might save.
    Although network managers might believe videoconferencing will cut
travel costs dramatically, this isn't always the case. Stevenson estimates
that 20 percent to 50 percent of travel can be displaced by
videoconferencing. In some manufacturing and engineering companies, the
real benefits may come in time saved designing and building systems.
    Furthermore, Earon points out that videoconferencing may actually
increase travel costs for a given configuration. If a company with several
outlying sites installs videoconferencing at its main sites, there might be
less travel between those two cities but more from outlying sites to
headquarters to use the videoconferencing facilities.

THE BIG PICTURE FOR H.261

By:
J.T.J.

Key to videoconferencing is the H.261 Recommendation, which the
International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) signed
off on in December 1990. It specifies how video bit streams are to be sent
across the network (at rates that are multiples of 64 kbit/s). Codecs that
incorporate this standard should be able to work together.
    H.261 also establishes a format for video, still-frame, and
high-resolution graphics--the Common Intermediate Format (CIF)--but
H.261-compatible codecs can conform either to CIF or to the Quarter CIF
(QCIF) subset. QCIF establishes lower video resolution than CIF (176 pixels
by 144 lines compared with 352 pixels by 288 lines). It also allows lower
resolution for graphics.
    Beyond decoding compressed video and displaying images in a
standard manner, codecs must establish communications across a network link
and compress and transmit the audio portion of a videoconference. Any
H.261-compatible codec must by definition conform to the CCITT
Recommendations that specify these functions. These recommendations fall
into two main categories: communications and control, and audio.
Communications and control specs include H.221, H.230, H.242, and H.320.
H.221 covers the frame structure of the videoconferencing link. H.230
describes the commands that each codec must be able to send, receive, and
interpret, such as loopback notification. H.242 handles call setup and
recognition, defining, for example, how two codecs establish data rates,
number of lines, and disconnect procedures. Finally, H.320 identifies the
equipment and system needed for narrow-bandwidth audiovisual
transmissions.
    Audio standards are spelled out in Recommendations G.711 and G.722.
While these weren't specifically developed for videoconferencing, many
codec vendors have adopted them. G.711 defines a 64-kbit/s encoding
algorithm that uses pulse code modulation (PCM); G.722 calls for 32 to 64
kbit/s of bandwidth using adaptive differential PCM (ADPCM). G.722 is
basically an improvement on G.711.
    Given these recommendations, it's possible to believe that
videoconferencing standards are well-nigh complete. But that's far from the
case. First, there are areas the CCITT has specifically chosen not to
standardize: video pre- and post- processing. It's this processing that
determines to a large degree the clarity of an image and processing delay
times.
    Second, there are areas that remain to be standardized, including
multipoint bridging, low-bit-rate audio encoding, encryption, and image
storage. Without a multipoint bridging spec, a vendor's codecs will only
operate with its own bridges. H.230 defines some of the necessary commands,
but the topic also is the subject of CCITT AV.254, which is still in
development. Ratification is not expected until 1992 or later. The CCITT is
just starting to work on low-bit-rate (16-kbit/s) audio and encryption;
low-bit-rate audio will free up more bandwidth for other purposes (such as
fax transmission). Encryption will help protect conference transmissions
against eavesdropping.
    Image-storage standards are under development by International
Standards Organizations (ISO) groups. The Moving Picture Experts Group, for
instance, is developing a spec for storing H.261-compatible video on hard
drives and optical disks. The Joint Photographic Experts Group is doing
similar work for digitized still-frame graphics.

FREEZE FRAME ON VIDEOCONFERENCING

By:
J.T.J.

To each its own'' is an apt description of the U.S. codec market. Of the
industry's Big Three, Compression Labs Inc. (CLI, San Jose, Calif.)
PictureTel Corp. (Peabody, Mass.), and VideoTelecom Corp. (Austin, Texas),
CLI is shooting for the high end. Its Rembrandt codecs are perhaps the best
known in the industry and tend to be perceived as top performers at high
bandwidths (384 kbit/s to 2.048 Mbit/s). The company also is hoping to put
its compression algorithms to work in high-definition television (HDTV) and
one-way business and educational video.
    PictureTel's specialty is low-cost videoconferencing, and it has
repeatedly broken price barriers for entry-level offerings. When it
introduced its $40,000 system in January, comparable setups cost about
$100,000. Its recent under-$20,000 monochrome startup system comes in at
roughly $10,000 less than rivals. Its codecs only run to 768 kbit/s; they
do not handle full T1.
    VideoTelecom hopes to add value by tying PCs and LANs into the
videoconference. The company's approach has garnered some attention but
relatively small market share thus far, although there are signs this may
be changing.
    A relative newcomer to U.S. videoconferencing, BT North
America--part of the British telecommunications giant--hopes to capture
significant share with its VC2200 and VC2100 codecs. These products were
designed by BT, but until this summer were manufactured and sold in the
United States by GPT Video Systems (Stamford, Conn.) as the System 261. GPT
will continue to sell the units, but BT has decided it wants a share of the
profits. According to Max Arafa, marketing manager for videoconferencing at
BT, his company has 70 percent of the market in the U.K. and 50 percent of
the Western European market (including the U.K.). BT has announced that it
plans on capturing 30 percent of the U.S. market within two years.

VIDEOCONFERENCING: NOT JUST TALKING HEADS

By:
Johna Till Johnson, Data Communications

If videoconferencing conjures up the vision of CEOs and other captains of
industry communing electronically with their international counterparts,
it's time to hit the fast-forward. That may be an apt description of
''traditional'' videoconferences, but today's technology is far more than
talking heads.
    Users have gotten the message loud and clear: They're starting to
connect smaller sites and tie other companies into video networks. They're
also working with conferencing gear in unusual ways: Engineers design
systems, lawyers take depositions, and professors teach classes--all via
videoconferencing. And surgeons are even guided through operations under
the watchful eye of the camera.
    Is videoconferencing a technology whose time has come? Industry
analysts and video codec vendors point to a barrage of statistics to
bolster their claims: Over the past few years, the price of a
videoconferencing system has dropped from $250,000 to under $25,000.
Elaborate rooms dedicated to videoconferencing are being replaced by
rollabout systems that turn any office into a conference room. And with a
standard finished up last year by the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee (CCITT) and now being implemented by codec vendors,
videoconferencing gear should soon be able to interoperate just like fax
machines or modems.
    Market forecasts are uniformly rosy. Forrester Research Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass.) predicts the market for videoconferencing equipment will
grow from a projected $120 million in 1991 to $239 million in 1995.
Herbert Maher, a senior vice president at the investment firm of Tucker
Anthony Inc. (Boston) sees equipment sales reaching as high as $300 million
in 1992, up from an estimated $185 million in 1991. Consulting and market
research firm Telemanagement Resources International Inc. (TRI, Lake Wylie,
S.C.) predicts worldwide annual revenues for videoconferencing equipment
and services growing from $510 million in 1991 to nearly $1.5 billion in
1995 (see Figure 1).
    ''I tell our clients, 'It's not a matter of if you will get
involved in videoconferencing, it's a matter of when,' '' says Ann Earon,
president of TRI. ''In fact, it's pretty safe to say that there aren't too
many industries out there that aren't doing something in video already.''
    But what makes 1991 or 1992 the year of the codec?
    Better equipment, for one thing: That means cheaper,
standards-based coder-decoders running compression algorithms with improved
voice and picture quality at lower speeds. Cheaper digital services from
network providers also are driving the market.
    To some extent, though, evolution has been the norm in
videoconferencing since 1981, when Compression Labs Inc. (CLI, San Jose,
Calif.) and NEC America Inc. (Herndon, Va.) were the only U.S. codec
vendors to speak of. Since then, the market has broadened to include such
players as Picturetel Corp. (Peabody, Mass.), VideoTelecom Corp. (Austin,
Texas), GPT Video Systems (Stamford, Conn.), and BT North America Inc.
(San Jose, Calif.)--all of whom offer codecs and conferencing systems in
the United States. Each has attempted to carve out a slightly different
niche, and individual codec designs reflect this.
    The top U.S. codec vendors are Compression Labs, PictureTel, and
VideoTelecom, in more or less that order (see table). In 1988, according to
Tucker Anthony, Compression Labs had the lion's share of the market,
selling 63 percent of all conferencing units. PictureTel followed, with 28
percent. The remainder was divided among the other companies. By 1992,
Tucker Anthony predicts that CLI's share will drop to 27 percent;
PictureTel's will hit 38 percent; and VideoTelecom's will climb to 15
percent (see ''Freeze Frame on Videoconferencing'').

STATE OF THE ART

    Compression is the sine qua non of videoconferencing; without
compressing the video images, conferencing would take up exorbitant amounts
of bandwidth. Until recently, all compression algorithms were proprietary,
which meant that codecs from different vendors couldn't work together. Last
December, however, the CCITT approved recommendation H.261, which defines a
video compression algorithm and a transmission mechanism for images at 64
kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s (see ''The Big Picture for H.261''). All major codec
vendors in the U.S. market either have implemented or will shortly
implement H.261-compatible algorithms. Many also still offer proprietary
algorithms.
    In essence, all compression schemes send an approximation of a
video image rather than the entire digitized image across the conferencing
link. And whenever possible, all transmit only those portions of an image
that have changed since the last frame rather than retransmitting the
entire frame each time.
    Thus, an algorithm's designers end up making fairly subjective
decisions about how best to approximate an image, and that can lead to a
fairly wide disparity in actual performance, even among algorithms based on
similar mathematical techniques. It's also why multiple algorithms are
available from most vendors.
    PictureTel, for example, offers SG3 (''second-generation 3''), SG2,
and H.261. SG3 is the most advanced, but software and sometimes firmware
upgrades are needed for older codecs. SG2 is offered for earlier PictureTel
codecs. Since putting multiple algorithms on a codec means adding software
or hardware or both, PictureTel offers one algorithm as standard and sells
the others as options (for $2,000 to $5,000 each). A typical customer might
purchase an SG3 codec and add H.261 to talk to units from other vendors.
    CLI supplies its Cosine Transform Extended (CTX) algorithm, Cosine
Transform Extended Plus (CTX Plus), and two versions of H.261 in four
packages for its Rembrandt codecs. The cheapest ($4,000) delivers CTX and a
lower-performance version of H.261. The $8,000 package adds a high-speed
version of the CCITT spec, and CTX Plus is added to the $12,000 package.
The final package includes four algorithms (both versions of H.261) plus
software for connecting to all other CLI codecs; it costs $21,500.
    Since vendors use different algorithms for their own products, how
do they ensure interoperability across their product lines? According to
Rich Baker, director of research for PictureTel, essentially the same way
that different-speed modems do. Once connected, two PictureTel codecs will
attempt to communicate using SG3. If that fails, they will drop down to
SG2, and finally to H.261.
    If that makes H.261 sound like the algorithm of last resort, that's
just how some in the industry see it. Robert F. Mitro, vice president of
sales and marketing at PictureTel, sees it as the the lowest common
denominator. ''We can get the same picture quality out of our proprietary
algorithm at 112 kbit/s as we do out of H.261 at 284 kbit/s.'' PictureTel's
Baker says the spec is primitive compared with PictureTel's own algorithms,
and John Walsh, senior vice president for planning and strategy at CLI,
calls it ''rudimentary connectivity.'' He also says H.261 lacks such key
elements as a low-bit-rate specification, encryption, and multipoint
communications.
    But BT sees it differently. ''We do not need a proprietary
algorithm,'' says Max Arafa, marketing manager for videoconferencing
products. ''We designed our product with H.261 in mind, and H.261 is
leading-edge stuff. Other vendors designed their products with H.261 as an
afterthought. Clearly they have optimized around proprietary algorithms.''
He accuses other vendors of promoting the idea that the standard is
insufficient in order to sell more of their own products.
    Users are equally split. Dan Gentile, telecommunications manager
for Maxtor Corp. (San Jose, Calif.) is evaluating videoconferencing systems
from CLI, PictureTel, VideoTelecom, and BT/GPT (products designed by BT and
manufactured by GPT are sold in the United States by both companies). In
his opinion, H.261 ''is very limited.'' But Ron Stevenson, program manager
for telecommunications at General Electric Co.'s Corporate Information
Technology (Fairfield, Conn.) has a different take: The vendors ''like the
fact that they have this embedded proprietary base, and they're going to
milk that to the end. Once it's all standards, it's all a commodity
market'' (see ''Lights, Camera, Action . . . Breaking Into
Videoconferencing'').
    Debate seems inescapable in a market where performance is so much a
matter of opinion. Although there are some objective criteria--frame
refresh rate, for instance--evaluating a codec tends to be more subjective
than, say, judging a T1 mux. Ultimately, there's really no substitute for
watching the picture through a range of motions and listening to the
sound.
    Resolution and motion are probably the best indicators of an
algorithm's abilities. PictureTel's Baker notes three key flaws affecting
video images: blocking, mosquitoes, and blurring.
    Blocking (or tiling) refers to images that resemble Impressionist
paintings: The image is present but fuzzy. Mosquitoes are tiny sparklike
points that form a shimmering halo (or aura) around a moving object or
person. Blurring describes a moving object that appears out of focus in the
area of motion.
    All three problems stem from the fact that compression algorithms
typically try to stuff a huge chunk of data through a narrow bandwidth pipe
by trading off resolution and smoothness of motion.
    In a codec, the analog video signal is sampled and converted into a
digital pattern that consists of 8-bit pixels. Each pixel describes either
the brightness or the color of a specific point. The Common Intermediate
Format (CIF) display specification, which is part of H.261, calls for
152,064 pixels per video frame, greater than 1.2 Mbits of data. Most codecs
transmit 15 to 30 frames a second. If those frames were uncompressed, it
could take nearly a T3 connection (45 Mbit/s) to transmit them. That's
where compression algorithms come in.
    Basically, compression algorithms attempt to hold down the number
of bits that must be sent per image. In effect, this is done by
transmitting only the ''important'' parts of an image and discarding the
rest.
    Most algorithms do so by using some variation of the discrete
cosine transform (DCT) to transpose the bit stream into the frequency
domain. (Frequency here refers to spatial, not temporal, frequency.) The
DCT of the image is run through a filter, which takes out the
high-frequency portions. (High-frequency, in this case, means those parts
of the image that are more or less uniform, say, those representing walls.)
The receiving codec performs the inverse of the transform and paints the
image on the screen.
    ''The object is to be able to represent the image in an accurate
way, even though you've thrown away 95 percent of it,'' explains
PictureTel's Baker. The transmitted information is thus not so much an
image per se, but instructions on how to reconstruct an image on the
receiving end of the transmission.
    The way a codec filters the signal affects the quality of the
image. If the filtering is not done well, viewers will see mosquitoes.
Blocking and blurring result more from the ongoing tug-of-war between
motion and resolution. A limited amount of bandwidth can be used either for
conveying information about motion or for image resolution, but not both.
    Blocking can be traced to initial division of the bit stream into
discrete blocks of pixels. With many algorithms, the processing is
performed block by block, rather than over the entire image. Typically, the
blocks are smoothed away by postprocessing at the receiving end, but if
there is a lot of motion, the algorithm won't have the bandwidth to modify
the blocks, and they'll appear on screen. With blurring, the codec lacks
the bandwidth to handle both resolution and motion: An object simply moves
too quickly to be captured with any degree of accuracy. The bandwidth is
devoted to capturing the motion, so resolution is sacrificed and the image
is blurred.
    Even when vendors agree on specific coding techniques (H.261, for
instance), codec performance can vary remarkably. The quality of the image
depends to a large degree on processing decisions (identifying the
''important'' part of any image or deciding how much bandwidth to devote to
smoothing).
    H.261, which is based on DCT, only specifies how the image is
decoded. It requires that codecs know how to conduct an inverse transform
and paint the image on screen; it does not specify how the image is to be
compressed. Hence, the diverse opinions about performance, particularly
when it comes to the CCITT spec. If a particular implementation of H.261 is
adept at reading the data and using the results, the picture will be
clearer and the motion smoother than another implementation's--yet both
will be able to interoperate.
TURN ON AND TUNE IN
    Another problem with judging performance is that many codecs may
appear to be ''tuned'' to particular data rates. In theory, the higher the
data rate the better the performance. In practice, this may not hold true.
Algorithms that deliver a certain quality at one speed may not do much
better at higher speeds. Similarly, codecs that perform well at high speeds
may look far worse at lower rates--much more than the drop in bandwidth can
account for.
    ''You should be able to have an algorithm that spans a wide range
of bit rates,'' says Baker. But given the complexity of the algorithms, it
makes sense for designers to try to optimize perceived performance at
particular speeds--usually those corresponding to such typical service
rates as 56 kbit/s, 112 kbit/s, 128 kbit/s, and so on.
    However, both the tuning and a viewer's response are subjective;
one vendor could choose to minimize certain features of an image at the
expense of others, making motion slightly smoother, say, at the cost of
greater blurring. A viewer who notices blurring more than smoothness might
find that ''tuning'' less desirable than other choices.
    Still, objective criteria exist. One of these is frame refresh
rate, the number of times a second that a receiving codec updates a picture
frame, which is basically a measure of the smoothness of motion. The North
American National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard specifies
roughly 30 frames per second for television broadcasts. The refresh rate
for codecs varies with the algorithm, data transmission rate, and motion in
a given image. (The more an object moves, the lower the frame refresh rate
will be.) CLI, often perceived as the Cadillac of codecs, tops out at 30
frames/s both with its CTX Plus algorithm and with H.261. That rate drops
to 15 frames/s for CTX. VideoTelecom achieves 30 frames/s with its Blue
Chip 30 algorithm and 10 to 15 frames/s with its other algorithms.
    A key point that tends to be overlooked, however, is that the
maximum frame rate is less critical than the minimum. An algorithm that
transmits 30 frames/s while displaying a blank wall but drops to 2 or 3
frames/s for a moving person is clearly not as good as one that maintains a
steady 10 frames/s.
    The catch is that vendors won't give their minimum frame refresh
rates, and for a perfectly valid reason: Frame rates decrease with the
amount of motion. A codec that maintains 5 to 10 frames/s during a
boardroom videoconference, for instance, might drop to 1 frame/s at a
basketball game. The best thing for net managers to do is compare codecs
displaying typical applications and attempt to push vendors on the issue of
minimum frame rates.

LET'S HEAR IT FOR...

    Another factor in the video quality equation is sound. True, the
image captures most of the initial attention in a videoconference, but
''The audio makes all the difference in the world,'' says William Ray,
director of communications network services for Corning Inc. (Corning,
N.Y.). Ray, who oversees a videoconferencing network with sites in the
United States and overseas, recounts an incident in which the audio wasn't
functioning properly. One potential user was unenthusiastic about the
equipment. Yet when the audio was corrected, the same user was impresssed
with the video quality. The picture quality hadn't changed at all, Ray
stresses, but the user's evaluation had improved enormously.
    Like images, sound is digitized and compressed by the codec.
Problems arise when the sound isn't synchronized perfectly with the picture
(someone appears to speak before his or her lips move, for instance) or
when the receiving codec doesn't cancel out echo.
    As with image transmission, these troubles are harder to overcome
at lower bandwidths because there are simply fewer bits to devote to a
solution. The bandwidth that's allocated to audio can range from 3.5 kbit/s
in very-low-bit-rate applications to 64 kbit/s in T1 video links. Most
vendors use adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) for audio
transmission, so effective audio frequencies range from 3.5 to 50 kHz.
    Videoconferencing echo is similar to echo in high-speed modems:
When a speaker at one end talks, the voice is transmitted across the link,
where it is heard at the other end. If the microphone at the other end
picks up that sound, it is retransmitted in an infinite loop, causing
feedback.
    Some of the ways that vendors try to eliminate echo involve keeping
volume down at the remote speakers, using directional microphones, and
employing elaborate switching mechanisms so that only the speaker's voice
is transmitted. Unfortunately, normal conversations are full of
interruptions, and speakers often get up and walk around the room. Thus,
vendors have developed echo cancellation algorithms--similar to those used
with V.32 modems but much more complex--that ''train'' the
videoconferencing units. In essence, the videoconferencing system measures
the acoustic characteristics of the conference room, taking what's known as
theimpulse response. (Depending on the algorithm, this impulse response can
be measured many times during the course of the conference.) Using this
information, the codec then subtracts the retransmitted echo from the
incoming voice signal. All in all, though, this is a very challenging
filtering process, and it rarely works perfectly.NEC, VideoTelecom, and
PictureTel all offer echo cancellation, but users seem to agree that the
PictureTel algorithm lives up to its sterling reputation. Corning's Ray,
for example, says PictureTel systems can be installed in virtually any room
without worrying about acoustics.

PICKING A CODEC

    Weighing all the performance issues to chose the right codec for
the job is probably the hardest part of designing a videoconferencing
system.
    As noted, users believe strongly that codecs vary in performance. But
performance alone should not be the only criterion: The amount of
bandwidth that must be allocated to achieve the desired picture quality
also is a factor. GE's Stevenson, for instance, says that his company
decided on the CLI product for most applications because of picture
quality, which he felt was more important (for most applications) than
bandwidth costs.
    GE's financial services division, however, chose PictureTel.
''Their needs are different,'' Stevenson says, explaining that financial
services tends to hold frequent, informal meetings, which makes the cost of
bandwidth more of an issue than picture quality. PictureTel delivers ''a
good picture at low bandwidth,'' Stevenson says.
    Finally, some users have specific requirements, such as the ability
to send and receive computer files and graphics during a videoconference.
Maxtor's Gentile, for instance, is intrigued by the fact that
VideoTelecom's MediaMax system will interface to his company's Ethernet LAN
to let him send engineering graphics. VideoTelecom is the only unit to date
with this ability.

THE REST OF THE SYSTEM

    Of course, a videoconferencing system includes more than just a
codec. Codec vendors and systems integrators also offer various cameras,
monitors, peripherals, and other options. From a network manager's
perspective, however, the most critical piece of equipment after the codec
is the access device. Codecs can work with switched and dedicated digital
links at bandwidths from 56 kbit/s to 1.544 Mbit/s, and they can connect to
these services in a variety of ways (see Figure 2).
    The plain-Jane approach is via a T1 CSU; this gives the codec
either the full T1 data rate or multiples of 64 kbit/s (depending on
service selected).
    Another option is to connect via a PBX. This makes sense when a
company has leased a T1 line to a site, for example, but will have some
channels free for low-bandwidth videoconferencing. Codec vendors often
have co-marketing agreements with PBX vendors. PictureTel, for example,
has agreements with AT&T for its Definity products and with Rolm and
Northern Telecom.
    With Switched 56 services, the codec generally connects through one
or two V.35 interfaces to a single or dual Switched 56 CSU/DSU. In some
cases, the CSU/DSU is integrated into the codec. PictureTel does this, as
does BT/GPT.
    Codec vendors also maintain lists of the products that will operate
with their equipment. CLI, for instance, will work with CSU/DSUs from ADC
Kentrox (Portland, Ore.), Digital Link Corp. (Sunnyvale, Calif.), and
Verilink Corp. (San Jose, Calif.).
    A final option for connecting to the network--one that's gaining
popularity--is through an inverse multiplexer. Although these units are
more expensive than CSU/DSUs, running $7,000 to $10,000 compared with
$2,000 or so, they make it possible to adjust bandwidth to the application.
A typical example of such a product is the Multiband bandwidth manager from
Ascend Communications Inc. (San Francisco).
    Ascend's Multiband combines multiple Switched 56 lines into a
high-bandwidth stream of up to 4 Mbit/s. This lets a company dial up only
the amount of bandwidth necessary for a particular call, allowing it to opt
for a low-bandwidth conference or a high-quality, 1.5-Mbit/s call. CLI is
planning to integrate its Multiband into its Rembrandt II/VP product line,
according to Ascend's co-founder Jay Duncanson. The company is planning
similar agreements with other codec makers.
    Multiband can connect to virtually any digital service, including
T1, Switched 56, and ISDN basic and primary rates. The flexibility of this
class of products, in fact, is a key reason for videoconferencing's growing
popularity. ''For the first time, videoconferencing is beginning to look
like standard telephone service,'' says Duncanson. ''You can procure a line
from a public carrier and pay only for service when you need it.'' Inverse
multiplexers also are offered by Teleos Communications Inc. (Eatontown,
N.J.), Newbridge Networks Inc. (Kanata, Ontario), and Digital Access Corp.
(Reston, Va.)
    PictureTel is taking a similar approach to digital services.
Although the company won't give specifics, the company's vice president of
sales and marketing, Robert Mitro, says it's planning to make its codecs
ISDN-capable.
    One part of the videoconferencing system that's often overlooked is
the multiport bridge. It's this gear that allows network managers to set up
multisite conferences; split-second switching is critical, since a bridge
must be able to switch among participants to keep the speaker's image on
screen. Instead of using bridges, it's possible to set up multiple
point-to-point links, but this gets expensive and cumbersome beyond
three-way conferences. Each site would need a codec, monitor, and comm link
for every other site.
    VideoTelecom, PictureTel, and CLI all make proprietary bridges.
Alternatively, net managers can use special bridging services from the
carriers, which have already purchased bridges and installed them at
central-office sites. Customers using digital services and codecs from the
same vendors as the bridges merely need to dial in to a specific number,
and the carrier will arrange the videoconference.

CHEAPER BY THE MINUTE

    The precipitous drop in price of videoconferencing equipment in
general and codecs in particular also has excited interest in this
technology. This year alone, the cost of an entry-level system hit two new
lows. In January, PictureTel introduced its System 4000 family, with a
starting price of $39,500; in July, it added two low-end models, the Model
20 and the Model 100, with a buy-in price of $19,900 for a monochrome unit.
Interestingly, even PictureTel admits to a degree of hype in all this
price-slashing: Mitro concedes that a true entry-level system--a bare-bones
system with a color monitor--starts at around $25,000. Still, that is a
sharp decline from the cost of a comparable system in 1988, which would
have run roughly $150,000.
    Why the drop? Codec vendors cite two reasons: first, technical
advances in the silicon. PictureTel and others who have been designing
their own chips have found they can consolidate functions of two or more
chips onto one piece of silicon, with a corresponding savings.
    Second, the law of supply and demand dictates that as
videoconferencing becomes more popular and vendors sell more products,
prices will come down.
    Equally important is the drop in the prices of network services.
''In 1987, the cost of a New York-to-California videoconference call was
maybe $150 an hour,'' says Mitro. Today that cost is under $20 an hour.
''Now it costs less than a call from a cellular car phone.''
    In that same period, the types of available services has grown
enormously. When videoconferencing made its debut as a business technology,
the only feasible way to link codecs was via a 1.544-Mbit/s dedicated line.
Now, in addition to dual 56-kbit/s links, carriers offer switched N56/64,
Switched 384, and switched T1, among others. And these services are getting
cheaper all the time.
    Bob McCarthy, product manager for AT&T Accunet switched digital
services, explains that the big change came in 1990, when the carriers
understood the need for usage-based prices for switched digital services.
Until then, he says, AT&T expected the primary application would be to back
up dedicated lines. But last year, it realized there were other
applications--including videoconferencing.
    As a result, AT&T cut its prices by about 75 percent, says
McCarthy, with a resultant surge in videoconferencing applications.
Corning's Ray says that his company installed its first pilot system last
summer, although he'd been following videoconferencing technology for five
years: ''By then, the price had come down until it looked affordable.''
    Despite the advances in network services, though, ''the big bugaboo
is still the network,'' says TRI president Ann Earon. Interoperability and
availability problems still remain. For instance, AT&T's switched digital
services won't work with those from US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas
City, Mo.) or MCI Communications Corp. (Washington, D.C.).
    Interoperability is holding back one of the most potentially
explosive applications of videoconferencing, company-to-
company conferencing. While H.261 means that codecs can interoperate, a
codec on a digital service from, say, Sprint, won't talk to another unit on
an AT&T network except through a gateway, a custom-
designed bridging unit. Companies that want to videoconference with their
suppliers, customers, business partners, and anyone else have to make sure
that these groups are on the same network.
    In general, conferencing systems come in two distinct sizes: room or
boardroom systems, which are more or less permanently installed in a
dedicated conference room, and rollabouts, which can be moved from room to
room. So-called desktop systems are somewhere in between--small enough to
be moved from one room to another but not designed to be portable. Some
vendors offer a range of products: PictureTel, for instance, supplies six
models of its System 4000, and other codec vendors have followed suit.
    The difference betwen a boardroom system and a rollabout is
primarily packaging: The same codec can be installed in either. Most
vendors' systems are modular, peripherals like control panels and graphics
cameras and stands can be added as necessary.
    Most analysts believe that traditional boardroom videoconferencing
is on the wane. While conference rooms will never disappear, they say,
these systems will become less important over time, as users add smaller,
more flexible solutions. TRI predicts that while room models will capture
nearly half of the revenue in 1991 (41 percent), they will account for only
29 percent of the market by 1995. Desktop models, by contrast, will grow
from 8 percent in 1991 to 29 percent 1995. TRI also sees multipoint
conferencing as a small but growing segment of the market, moving from 1
percent in 1991 to 3 percent in 1995.

WHERE IT'S GOING

    What lies ahead? The crystal ball is, as always, cloudy, but some
trends stand out:
    For VideoTelecom, the integration of computer graphics and data is
already a reality. The company's Mediamax ''mediaconferencing'' system lets
users tie in LAN and PC data and graphics with more conventional audio and
video components. Because the system uses a PC-based architecture, it
connects as readily to a LAN as any PC. This sort of computer literacy is
not wasted on some users. Maxtor's Gentile points out that the ability to
exchange computer graphics would be very handy in engineering
applications.
    Other vendors agree that PC-based videoconferencing is the way to
go. PictureTel and Intel Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) have entered into an
agreement to develop multimedia technology for desktop applications.
    It's no news that the original picturephone flopped in 1964 and has
gone nowhere since. But CLI and AT&T have a joint venture to bring to
market a 19.2-kbit/s, full-color, full-motion videophone by 1992, and
others are likely to follow in their wake. PictureTel and BT/GPT have both
expressed interest in developing such a device. Hitachi recently displayed
a prototype ISDN-compatible unit that sells in Japan for 1 million yen
(about $7,000).
    In the end, the chances are very good that videoconferencing will
find its way to the desktop, whether inside a computer or added onto a
phone. More importantly, codecs will continue to get better and cheaper,
data services will proliferate, and standards will evolve to make products
truly interoperable. So get ready for videoconferencing. It'll be a fact of
life in the '90s.

CALLING ALL LANS: ISDN FOR LAN INTERCONNECT
Public ISDNs are starting to emerge as a practical way to link LANs in
Europe. But given serious equipment shortcomings and patchy service
availability, users are well advised to look before they leap

By:
Stephen Saunders and Elke Gronert, Data Communications International

In theory, Europe is just one PC card away from LAN interconnect via ISDN.
Commercial ISDNs are beginning to operate across the Continent, promising
to deliver users at last from notoriously high leased-line tariffs. ISDN's
long list of benefits seems too good to be true: It provides as much
bandwidth as digital leased lines. It's billed by the minute instead of the
month. Users get advanced features like the ability to call multiple
locations simultaneously. A one-minute transmission can be set up within a
couple of seconds between any pair of ISDN users. All that's been missing,
so the theory goes, is a card to connect LANs to ISDN. And now that such
cards are starting to appear, Europe should be ready to cross the threshold
into an era of faster, more efficient LAN connections over the wide area.
    In reality, though, users looking to connect LANs over ISDN today
face two major obstacles. First, only a handful of European countries have
full-scale commercial ISDNs, and coverage is patchy in some of those.
Second, most large vendors of bridges and routers--the key building blocks
of LAN interconnect--have yet to implement ISDN interfaces. Many other
vendors have brought out interim solutions, mainly in the form of PC-based
ISDN interface cards and software that perform bridging and routing. These
products range from low-end, manually operated devices to an IP router with
a throughput of 2.048 Mbit/s (see Table 1).
    These interim products are suitable only in certain applications.
The penalty for picking the wrong product could be a PTT bill so large it
makes users wonder why they bothered to switch to ISDN. But in the right
situation, an ISDN interface can save lots of money and even make possible
applications that previously were out of the question. If any one statement
can be applied to ISDN products thus far, it's that it pays for users to
shop carefully.

EQUIPMENT OBSTACLES

    The idea of ISDN for LAN interconnect is an appealing one: It
replaces slow analog dial-up lines and costly digital leased lines with a
fast, cost-efficient, ubiquitous service. All nodes on all LANs get two
64-kbit/s B channels, one 16-kbit/s D channel, and access to any other
node--a new concept for Europeans unfamiliar with switched digital
services. But a standard device that ties LANs to ISDN doesn't yet exist.
To date, the closest thing to it is a PC-based ISDN interface card and
bridging or routing software, used in conjunction with a standard LAN
interface card (see figure).
    Europe's low number of ISDN users and its patchwork of different
ISDN standards have discouraged bridge and router vendors from developing
integral ISDN interfaces for their equipment. ''Unless you target a
specific country, the market just isn't there,'' says David Bird, technical
support manager for the U.K. division of router maker Proteon Inc.
(Westborough, Mass.). Each national ISDN interface has to undergo lengthy
attachment approval tests, further discouraging vendors, says Nigel Oakley,
product marketing manager for U.K. operations of 3Com Corp. (Santa Clara,
Calif.). Still, some bridge and router vendors are developing ISDN
interfaces. Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.), for example, says it will add a
64-kbit/s ISDN interface to its bridges by mid-1992 for unspecified
countries.
    Using a terminal adapter to connect existing routers or bridges to
an ISDN has some serious shortcomings, despite what vendors may claim. The
problems arise from ISDN's use of a separate D channel to carry the signals
that set up and tear down calls, identify the type of traffic on the B
channels, and invoke other services such as calling-line identification. In
a normal bridge or router, that information is carried on the same channel
as the data; terminal adapters cannot separate and convert it for use on
ISDN D channels. As a result, the terminal adapters will pass traffic from
routers and bridges to ISDN B channels but they cannot set up and tear down
calls automatically--often a vital feature for minimizing line costs.
    IBM acknowledges that the inability of its terminal adapter, the
7820, to automatically control ISDN lines is a drawback, but it says it's
addressing the problem, as are other vendors. Terminal adapters that
present an X.21 or V.24 interface can be configured to automatically dial a
preset number and thus set up an ISDN B channel call when requested by the
attached equipment. Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) uses this
facility in Version 8.3 of its firmware so that its routers can invoke an
ISDN backup when the existing trunk fails or becomes congested.

INTEGRATED INTERFACES

    While bridge and router vendors are hanging fire on integrating
ISDN interfaces in their products, major computer makers such as Digital
Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (Palo Alto,
Calif.) are launching ISDN interface cards that connect LANs to other LANs,
hosts, or standalone PCs. Many smaller vendors also have developed packages
for PCs and Apple Macintoshes comprising ISDN cards and bridging or routing
software.
    Of the products shown in Table 1, most are PC cards. They can be
managed with the PC's monitor and keyboard, and the PC's hard disk can be
used to store configuration data. The disadvantage is PCs are not designed
specifically as bridges or routers and thus provide much lower performance
than specialized devices.
    Some features of sophisticated bridges, such as filtering of
broadcast packets, are likely to be rudimentary in PC-based bridges.
PC-based routers will likely do a better job than PC-based bridges in
filtering out unwanted packets before transmission over ISDN. It's worth
checking whether products support the full complement of router functions,
such as multihop routing and intelligent load balancing. Some vendors, such
as MBP Kommunikationssysteme GmbH (Dortmund, Germany), have incorporated
support for Novell's Internet Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol in their
products to ensure full router functionality across an ISDN.
    Some vendors interviewed for this article were unable to say if
their products were bridges or routers, or what protocols their products
would support. For this reason, users are well advised to borrow products
for evaluation before buying them. After installation, it's also advisable
to monitor PTT bills, if possible on a daily basis, to check whether the
ISDN is carrying packets that should have been filtered out.

LINE CONTROL

    Automatic line control offers another way to minimize PTT bills.
Usually implemented in software, line control lets users adjust their
equipment so that calls can be extended to match the billing increments set
by PTTs. The length of these increments varies; it can be as little as 18
seconds on many long-distance routes to as long as six minutes for local
calls in Germany. ''You can program our device to hold the call until just
before that time, and then drop it,'' says Stefan Gieseler, manager of
product marketing for communication systems at MBP. As increment length
rises, so does the ''free'' time available to users. At the same time, line
control helps users cut down on billing for unused connection time.
    Automatic re-establishment of failed ISDN calls is a feature worth
paying for. It would have paid dividends for the Department of Computer
Science at University College London, where ISDN connections were dropped
every 10 minutes by a bug in an ISDN switch from British Telecommunications
PLC (BT, London). Using information available on the ISDN D channel, the
university's failed calls could have been re-established automatically.
    With automation, however, comes the need for network management.
Like other services, ISDNs must be monitored so that alerts can be
triggered when problems arise. Without alerts, network managers may
unwittingly invoke backup lines (and rack up usage charges) while failed
lines lie idle and unreported to the PTT.
    A few vendors, such as Hewlett-Packard and Bintec Computersysteme GmbH
(Nuremberg, Germany), incorporate support for the industry-standard simple
network management protocol (SNMP) in their products. Other vendors, such
as OST S.A. (Cesson-Sevigne, France) and Teli AB (Nynashamn, Sweden),
provide local proprietary management. Digital Equipment Corp. provides
local or remote proprietary management.  But some vendors don't provide
any method of managing their products, either locally or remotely; these
include Industrade AG (Wallisellen, Switzerland) and Stollmann GmbH
(Hamburg, Germany).

MANY CARDS, MANY CALLS

    Most ISDN cards support simultaneous calls over both B channels of a
basic-rate interface (BRI), and some products accept multiple cards in the
same chassis, enabling communications with several destinations at once.
For example, up to three DEC ISDNcontroller 100 cards can be fitted into
the Q-bus of DEC's MicroVAX computers. When loaded with DEC's VAX ISDN
Access Software, the MicroVAX acts as an ISDN Ethernet server, allowing
data from LAN-attached nodes, including non-bus computers, to be routed
over an ISDN to nodes on remote LANs also equipped with the card. With
three cards loaded, the server simultaneously can exchange data with six
sites at 64 kbit/s per connection. Multiple ISDN cards can be installed in
PCs as well as minicomputers. Up to four of MBP's cards supporting NetWare
routing functions can be combined to support eight simultaneous calls. Up
to eight of OST's IP router cards canbe installed in the same PC to
support 16 simultaneous 64-kbit/s calls.
    Some vendors add another degree of sophistication by synchronizing
calls to the same location so that higher bandwidths can be supported.
Industrade offers an IP router similar to OST's, but its product can
combine any two channels for total throughput of 128 kbit/s. In
Hewlett-Packard's ISDN Server, up to six B channels can be combined to
deliver throughput of 384 kbit/s.

BIGGER BANDWIDTHS

    Bintec recently took the concept of multiple cards and channel
synchronization a step further with the introduction of its ISI/Gate IP
router, which can provide aggregate bandwidths as high as 2.048 Mbit/s--the
same as an E1 leased line. The router has slots for 16 ISDN cards (from
other vendors as well as Bintec) in an AT bus. Each ISDN card can be
connected directly to a BRI socket or to a PBX connected to an ISDN.
    ''We tested all the available solutions on the market, and ISI/Gate
is the only one which can be expanded to support 32 B channels,'' says
Andreas Merkel, a member of the data processing center's networking group
at the University of Konstanz (Germany).
    Bintec also is the only vendor to have implemented data compression
in its product. Usually, protocol overhead can cut actual throughput to
rates as low as 40 kbit/s on each 64-kbit/s channel, but Bintec's device
uses an algorithm called Van Jacobson Compression to reduce TCP/IP protocol
overhead from 40 bytes to just 5 bytes per packet. With compression turned
on, data throughput of 62 kbit/s can be achieved on each B channel,
according to Merkel. ''Without the compression this throughput wouldn't
have been possible,'' he says. Another vendor, Dataflex Design Ltd.
(London), is working on a way to incorporate the CCITT's V.42bis error
correction and data compression algorithm in its terminal adapter. Dataflex
says it will ship a product by the end of the year.
    The ISI/Gate also supports communications with any other ISDN location
as wellas simultaneous communications at lower speeds with multiple sites,
neither of which would be possible with a normal router attached to an E1
line. A primary-rate version of the ISI/Gate will be available in
mid-1992, says the vendor.
    Only one vendor--Gandalf Data Ltd. (Nepean, Canada)--already
supports LAN interconnection over a primary-rate interface (PRI, which in
Europe combines 30 B channels). Gandalf's ISDN Primary Rate Subsystem fits
inside its Starmaster multiprotocol communications server. The Starmaster
links IEEE 802.3 Ethernets and routes TCP/IP and DEC's Local Area Transport
(LAT) protocols. Like the Bintec product, Gandalf's offering can
synchronize all its channels to deliver the maximum throughput of 1.92
Mbit/s.
    Gandalf's Subsystem can connect the Starmaster to ISDN PBXs from
Northern Telecom (Mississauga, Canada), AT&T (New York), BT, Siemens AG
(Munich), and GEC Plessey Telecommunications PLC (GPT, Coventry, U.K.),
enabling Starmaster-attached devices to share ISDN bandwidth with
PBX-attached voice lines.
    An early user of the Gandalf switch, the Department of Computer
Science at University College London, says the switch adds five seconds to
call set-up times. In experiments with BT's ISDN, calls took seven seconds
to set up when routed through the switch and only one or two seconds when
routed through other equipment.

WHEN ISDN PAYS

    But even the most advanced ISDN gear is only as good as the service
it's connected to. However appealing the prospect of ISDN for LAN
interconnect may seem, users should examine availability and tariffing
issues before rushing out to buy the latest in ISDN interfaces. The
economic argument for or against LAN interconnect via ISDN varies according
to the type of traffic being supported, the distance between sites, and the
country. As is the case with the interface equipment, users need to
consider their needs carefully before committing to a service.
    ISDN is best suited for relatively large file transfers because its
64-kbit/s B channels are circuit switched and because usage charges are
based on ordinary telephone tariffs, which usually have a minimum duration
of at least one minute. In theory, a 480-kbyte file--relatively large by
most standards--can be transferred across a 64-kbit/s link in one minute.
    An unidentified car maker in Europe already is using ISDN to ship
CAD files to its component suppliers, according to Sun Microsystems Inc.
(Mountain View, Calif.). The files are generated on Sun workstations and
shipped via networks of PC-based bridges and routers. ''ISDN is absolutely
strategic to this company,'' says Jean-Pierre Baudouin, head of Sun's
International Center for Network Computing (Grenoble, France), which is
charged with developing ISDN interfaces for Sun workstations.
    There are other applications, such as those involving interactive
traffic, where ISDN may not be economical for LAN interconnect. When
interactive traffic is carried via ISDN B channels, users pay for bandwidth
whether they use it or not, since a link must be kept active to handle
whatever traffic is generated. In this case, packet-switched services may
be more economical. Some of the LAN interconnect services based on frame
relay, itself an outgrowth of ISDN, might offer another alternative when
(and if) they become widely available in Europe.
    ISDN's feasibility vis-a-vis leased lines depends on the distance
between sites and on the country (or countries) where the sites are
located. In short, ISDN is most cost-effective when linking LANs across
borders at 64 kbit/s, according to the consultancy Logica Cambridge Ltd.
(London). In Belgium, for example, a 64-kbit/s leased line would be more
cost-effective than ISDN only if users required more than 230 minutes a
day of connect time (see Table 2). In Germany, where leased-line tariffs
are among the highest in Europe, users would need 450 minutes of daily
connect time to justify a 64-kbit/s cross-border leased line. Even in the
case of BT, which nearly doubles its charges for international data calls
over ISDN, the break-even point for leased lines is 158 minutes per day.
    Within countries, however, it's a mixed picture. ISDN is a
nonstarter as an alternative to leased lines within the U.K. But in
Belgium, primary-rate (1.92-Mbit/s) ISDN compares much more favorably with
leased lines than a single B channel, particularly for local links. At
present, it pays to use primary-rate ISDN rather than a 1.92-Mbit/s leased
line in Germany if daily usage totals less than 90 minutes. However,
drastic cuts are planned in German leased-line tariffs that might upset
these calculations.
    Where tariffs are similar, of course, ISDN is a much better
alternative to digital leased lines. Unlike leased lines, ISDN enables
users to connect with any other user of switched digital services--an
advantage that will snowball as ISDN's coverage increases, national ISDNs
are interconnected, and the number of ISDN users increases.

PATCHY COVERAGE

    At present, ISDN in Europe is characterized by limited
availability, few users, and plans for rapid expansion by 1994. Those are
the conclusions of a recent study prepared for the Commission of the
European Communities by two consultants, Ovum Ltd. (London) and
Fischer & Lorenz (Copenhagen, Denmark). The study, titled ''European ISDN
Atlas, 1991,'' shows where ISDN is available and when it will reach other
locations in the European Community. ISDN installation plans are given for
all European Community countries, as are the years when ISDN will be
commercially available in each major city.
    Only four European countries--Belgium, France, Germany, and the
U.K.--had commercial ISDNs on January 1, 1991, according to the study. At
that time, the number of installed basic-rate ISDN lines totaled a mere
14,665, compared with 100,000 in the U.S. and 20,000 in Japan. Europe had a
total of 2,865 primary-rate lines, compared with 500 in the U.S. and 500 in
Japan.
    Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (Bonn, Germany) gives higher figures
than those in the study, but its numbers are for ISDN lines ordered, not
lines installed. The difference in statistics does show that Germany is
investing heavily in ISDN, as are some other European PTTs.
    In fact, the PTTs are closer to offering comprehensive coverage
than U.S. carriers, according to one of the study's authors, Ovum's Stephen
Timms. France Telecom already claims to offer national coverage for its
ISDN, Numeris, although it acknowledges that users might have to wait six
months for an ISDN line in some locations.
    By January 1, 1994, the deadline set by PTTs for the delivery of
commercial ISDNs based on common European standards, PTTs are promising
ISDN in 100 percent of business locations in Belgium, Denmark, France, and
the U.K. Standardized service, sometimes called ''Euro-
ISDN,'' will be available in 80 percent to 99 percent of business locations
in Germany and Portugal, 60 percent to 79 percent of those in the
Netherlands and Ireland, and 40 percent to 59 percent of those in Italy and
Spain, according to the study.

MULTIVENDOR NETS
MADE EASY

Putting together a multivendor network is difficult enough, but to those
charged with explaining each vendor's systems and network architectures the
job can seem just about impossible. In A Manager's Guide to Multivendor
Networks, John Enck maps out an approach that's comprehensive enough for
training executives and technical staff alike. The book not only defines
the networking architectures of four key vendors--IBM, Digital Equipment
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Sun Microsystems Inc.--but also notes the
similarities and differences among them.
    Enck also explores the ties that bind together multivendor nets,
including standards, messaging services, and network management systems.
Most major U.S. and European standards are covered, as are the OSI
seven-layer reference model and the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP)
standard. Enck examines the major components of wide-area services,
including X.25 networks and X.400 electronic mail, and offers a guide to
troubleshooting problems on LANs and WANs. The book costs $35.

A COMMON MOTIF

Motif, the graphical user interface for X-Windows, goes Microsoft Windows
one better: Unlike the popular PC operating environment, the Open Software
Foundation's Motif is platform-independent. Indeed, the X-Windows system
itself already has been implemented on networks made up of Unix, VAX, DOS,
and Apple Macintosh systems. With Motif Programming Manual by Dan Heller as
a guide, users can write a single, consistent, intuitive interface for all
their applications.
    Heller, the creator of Z-Mail, a widely used electronic-mail
package, introduces the Motif tool kit and supplies definitions of all
classes of Motif objects. In addition to explaining the Motif programming
model, Heller discusses the basics of user interface design. Each of the
main elements of the Motif library is examined in its own chapter. The
manual assumes some familiarity with the C programming language, although
Heller notes in his preface that ''even those who dabble in C can
understand the concepts well enough to do most things.'' Motif Programming
Manual costs $34.95.

IBM'S SYSTEM VIEW: ADDING FUNCTION TO FORM
A year after its unveiling, IBM's grand scheme for total systems
management is still in its formative stage

In product announcements and statements of direction issued over the past
year, IBM has gone to great lengths to tell the world that SystemView is a
cornerstone of its master information technology plan for the 1990s and
beyond. Yet more than a year after SystemView's unveiling, its composition
and implications remain a mystery.
    IBM itself is largely to blame for much of the confusion
surrounding SystemView. In many of its statements, the vendor has implied
very strongly that SystemView is a real architecture, albeit one that has
yet to be released formally. The reality, however, is that SystemView is
not an architecture but a strategy that to this point lacks a tangible
foundation.
    SystemView's charter is ambitious: to provide a total systems
management framework for enterprises with information processing systems
that are built on a diverse collection of computing and communications
platforms. SystemView encompasses not only the hardware but also the
applications and the operational procedures required to run a distributed
computing environment from the largest IBM and non-IBM systems down to
individual desktop workstations.
    SystemView's breadth and scope are daunting enough to give pause
even to staunch IBM supporters. Yet many corporate networkers now are
counting on IBM to deliver on its lofty promises. More thana third of the
nearly 460 network management professionals who responded to a May 1991
survey by the Datapro Information Services Group (Delran, N.J.) said they
would choose SystemView as their open systems management model--ahead of
such high-profile solutions as OSI and TCP/IP with its simple network
management protocol (SNMP). No doubt that percentage will climb as IBM's
plans begin to take shape with real products.
    If SystemView lives up to all of IBM's advance billing, few users
are likely to be disappointed. In IBM's scheme, SystemView will serve as a
framework that will enable most, if not all, of the diverse management
activities of running a computer system to be integrated and, where
possible, automated. It will go beyond ''technical'' issues to address
other management tasks integral to the operation of any system, such as
financial administration, service-level tracking, capacity planning, and
even business planning.
    IBM is counting on SystemView to help it maintain its leadership
role in defining the direction that information technology will take. IBM
has prided itself on being able to develop proprietary architectures that
become industry standards with tremendous staying power--witness the
System/370 and SNA. IBM's latest architectural foray, Systems Application
Architecture (SAA), has not been a resounding success to date, but IBM
seems intent on boosting SAA into its systems pantheon. In its September
1990 unveiling of SystemView, IBM went to great lengths to make one point
very clear: SystemView is an integral part of SAA.
    Ideally, IBM would have waited until SystemView's underlying
architecture was intact--or at least clearly defined--before announcing it.
But pressure from other vendors, most notably Digital Equipment Corp.,
forced IBM to take the wraps off its strategy. DEC announced its total
systems management plan, Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), in 1989,
a year before IBM gave any inkling of SystemView.
    Although the September 1990 introduction of SystemView and a
smattering of ''conformant'' products seemed rushed, it did manage to
swing the momentum in the systems management race in IBM's favor. With one
bold and blustering move, IBM managed to take the high ground and redefine
the expectations for the range of management functions needed for computer
environments in the coming years. In the process, IBM also raised the ante
in the high-stakes battle for the multivendor, open systems network
management arena.
    IBM upped that ante a little more this past September, when it
announced several more SystemView developments, including an expanded list
of ''SystemView-conformant'' products from IBM and third-party partners and
a set of criteria for gauging product conformance to SystemView. Although
IBM did not unveil its formal blueprint for SystemView--Systems Management
Architecture (SMA)--in its September 1991 announcements, as it was expected
to do, that introduction should take place within the next year.
    The September 1990 and 1991 announcements don't come close to
revealing the entire SystemView scheme, but they do offer some solid clues
about where IBM expects to take systems management in general--and network
management in particular--in the coming years. How well IBM succeeds in
leading computer and communications technology into the next century
remains to be seen; but the effect that those efforts will have on
corporate information networks will be profound.

BLURRING LINES

    The need for a management architecture that cuts across vendor
lines and embraces as many facets of systems management as possible is
driven by one undeniable fact: The distinctions between computers,
networks, and applications are blurring to the point of irrelevance.
Management responsibilities are widening within specific disciplines as
well. For instance, systems managers can no longer focus solely on
predicting, isolating, tracking, and resolving network problems; they must
also tackle such ''nontechnical'' issues as performance (response-time and
service-level) tracking, capacity planning, asset management, and
configuration management.
    Despite criticism to the contrary, IBM has not been a laggard in
the management arena. It started to embed integrated management features
into SNA as far back as 1977. In that pre-PC era, failures and errors in
large-system communications hardware and in communications links were the
biggest problems for network managers. For that reason, IBM focused on
developing management facilities for monitoring and controlling hardware
rather than applications.
    This original bias toward hardware is evident to this day. Over the
last few years, however, IBM has made a concerted effort to swing its
emphasis to the application side. NetView, introduced in 1986, is part of
IBM's push to expand network management beyond hardware. NetView is now the
predominant network management system for System/370 SNA networks.
    IBM's efforts in the 1980s to move beyond hardware management were
not limited to NetView. IBM brought together all of SNA's management
facilities in 1986, in a standalone, subordinate architecture known as
SNA/Management Services (SNA/MS). Still, IBM's aspirations for management
far exceed what is available with NetView today or even postulated in the
latest revision of SNA/MS.

GRAND ENTRANCE

    Enter SystemView. IBM introduced its systems management vision in a
massive September 1990 coming-out party that featured nearly 150 products
relating to the launching of the System/390 range of computers. The
SystemView announcement was a daring, and probably premature, move by IBM
to articulate its long-term objectives for multivendor systems management.
    In the SystemView introduction, IBM revealed a number of long-term
systems management goals, including the following: Improvements in the
usability of its systems management control programs; Consistent
definitions of resources to be managed; Consistent access to, and
management of, resource definition data; Compliance with open systems
standards, such as the International Organization for Standardization's
(ISO's) common management information services (CMIS) and common
management information protocol (CMIP) standards; Automation of management
tasks whenever appropriate; Provision of management application program
interfaces (APIs) to ensure customer and third-party participation and
integration; Provision of relevant support applications, such as SAA Asset
Manager/MVS, one of the few SystemView applications to be released by IBM.
    All these objectives are similar to, and no doubt inspired by, the
goals that IBM spelled out for SAA back in 1987.
    This past September, a year after SystemView's introduction, IBM
kept the ball rolling with another high-profile announcement, introducing
more SystemView products and its lineup of SystemView product development
partners (see Table 1). It also released a preliminary draft of SystemView
conformance guidelines (see Table 2).

WAITING FOR AN ARCHITECTURE

    Of course, before SystemView can become a reality, it needs an
actual foundation. SystemView's architecture, known in IBM circles as the
Systems Management Architecture, was supposed to have been delivered by
now; its debut has been pushed back to 1992. The delay is troublesome but
understandable given the scope of IBM's undertaking.
    When it is completed, SMA--and thus SystemView--will enable SAA,
AIX (IBM's Unix), DOS/VSE, and other IBM hosts, as well as non-IBM systems,
to be configured, controlled, and monitored across SNA, OSI, and TCP/IP
networks (see Figure 1).
    The September 1991 SystemView announcements included two
developments with important ramifications for network managers. One is
IBM's implicit integration of NetView into the SystemView framework. The
other is management support for heterogeneous LANs.
    Enhancements to NetView Version 2, such as S/390 Automation
Services and extended graphical capabilities announced in September, now
carry the SystemView imprimatur. The NetViewinfusion adds immediate
credibility to SystemView. It also means that users won't have to worry
about backing the wrong management horse.
    NetView already addresses some of SystemView's basic objectives,
although with an emphasis on network management. These include problem
management, response time monitoring, inventory tracking, and software
distribution. NetView also has rudimentary compatibility with SNMP, the
open network management standard for TCP/IP networks.
    NetView should provide a useful nucleus around which to expand
SystemView--at least for the time being. At some point, however, NetView,
with its heavy SNA orientation, will have to undergo some fundamental
changes to conform with all SystemView goals.
    IBM ultimately may decide to phase out its NetView products and
replace them with more robust SystemView counterparts. Although it debuted
in 1986, NetView evolved from a series of vintage 1970s network management
products, such as Network Communications Control Facility (NCCF), Network
Problem Determination Application (NPDA), and Network Logical Data Manager
(NLDM). The overlap between some ''value-added'' SystemView and NetView
offerings, such as the SAA Delivery Manager and the NetView Delivery
Manager, suggests that IBM may be thinking about replacing its NetView
offerings with SystemView equivalents.
    Beyond NetView, network management support for heterogeneous LANs
comes in the latest release of Advanced Communications Function/Virtual
Telecommunications Access Method (ACF/VTAM). Version 3, Release 4 of
ACF/VTAM, through the 3172 Interconnect Controller, now accommodates SNA
traffic over Token-Ring, Token-Bus, fiber distributed data interface
(FDDI), and carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection
(CSMA/CD) LANs alongside TCP/IP traffic. This support, which incorporates
the 3172's fiber optic Enterprise System Connection (Escon) channel
connection, allows ACF/VTAM hosts to interact with LANs up to 5.6 miles
away at up to 10 Mbyte/s, the direct channel rate.
    The SNA and TCP/IP support, coupled with the OSI support that IBM
plans to offer via OSI/Communications Subsystem (OSI/CS), elevates IBM to
being a prime, if not the only, vendor that can offer a heterogeneous
communications system comprising LANs, WANs, integrated SNA, TCP/IP, and
OSI. With ACF/VTAM 3.4, its other communications subsystem software, and
existing NetView technology, IBM at least has the makings of the
communications infrastructure it will need to realize at least the SNA,
TCP/IP, and OSI network management aspects of SystemView.
    IBM's protocol repertoire should expand even further next month,
assuming the introduction of its first multiprotocol router comes off as
planned. The router, which will be based on IBM's RS/6000 workstation, is
likely to accommodate such non-IBM LAN protocols as Novell Inc.'s Internet
Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX), DECnet, and
AppleTalk.

SYSTEMVIEW'S THREE DIMENSIONS

    In its SystemView outlines to date, IBM has defined its management
strategy in terms of three interrelated elements that it calls dimensions:
the end-use dimension, the application dimension, and the data dimension
(see Figure 2). These three dimensions are analogous to SAA's Common User
Access (CUA), Common Programming Interface, and Common Communications
Support components. Like SAA's components, SystemView's three dimensions
will provide relevant guidelines, standards, architectures, and application
program interfaces (APIs) for integrating systems management applications.
    The end-use dimension will set the criteria for providing
workstation users with a consistent and uncomplicated view of SystemView
applications. It will define the guidelines for a common interface to be
used by all systems management applications. The criteria defined in this
dimension will ensure that SystemView meets its improved usability
objective. The end-use dimension is oriented toward iconic, object-based,
point-and-click technology. It is based on an SAA CUA interface that will
be implemented on programmable workstations (IBM PS/2s).
    It now appears that the SystemView end-use dimension will be
implemented on top of IBM's OS/2-based GraphicsView/2 product, which was
announced in September 1990 and is slated to be released by the end of
this year. GraphicsView/2 facilitates the display of system and network
configurations using color-coded status designations. The Graphic Monitor
Facility of NetView Version 2, Release 1, though not based on
GraphicsView/2, offers a relatively faithful preview of what will be
available with GraphicsView/2.
    SystemView's application dimension will set the criteria for
implementing and integrating systems management applications. It will
specify the services and interfaces needed to control, coordinate, and
operate heterogeneous, enterprise-wide information systems. This dimension
has six distinct disciplines: business management, change management,
configuration management, operations management, performance management,
and problem management. IBM has said it will define the application
dimension criteria in such a way as to promote the implementation of
systems management applications to address the various disciplines that
will cross operating system and network boundaries.
    The data dimension will define the requirements for the consistent
definition of resources and the consistent access to such data. To do so,
it will rely on a data model that will use the SAA Database Access
Interface, a Structured Query Language (SQL) interface. The model will be
compatible with the ISO's 10165-4 guidelines for the definition of managed
objects and the 10165-1 management information model.

THE FASTSERVICE FACTOR

    One IBM offering that is emerging as an important component of
SystemView is the Failure Analysis and Support Technology Service, or
FASTService. Introduced in August 1990, FASTService comprises
methodologies, software, hardware, and dedicated customer support--complete
with a toll-free phone line--aimed at finding and resolving as quickly as
possible software problems that arise in S/390 MVS applications.
    FASTService is an innovative and practical offering that in a sense
characterizes the leading-edge, total spectrum management philosophy
embodied in SystemView. It offers facilities to ''trap'' problems the
instant they occur; automatically log problems with a unique identifier to
a user-specified database; produce customized storage dumps; automatically
notify a remote support group; and automatically search a database for
possible resolutions to the problem.
    FASTService is based on the use of IBM-supplied ''software
probes.'' Application developers insert these probes--
which are in the form of S/370 Assembler, Cobol, or PL/1 macros--at
critical points within the application. A probe is triggered whenever it is
encountered in the execution path of the application; thus, probes are
inserted in error or unexpected paths within the application. When
triggered, the software code associated with the probe performs a set of
services specified for that probe. These services can include the
generation of a code dump, the issuance of a NetView alert, or the
invocation of a search process to determine if a resolution has already
been posted for the problem associated with that probe. The benefits of
such automated technology are so compelling that IBM itself intends to use
it in its future strategic products.
    FASTService has yet to be used widely and is now available as a
service within the United States only. It also is fairly expensive right
now. But it does offer the very tangible benefit of significantly reducing
the time and effort needed to debug and maintain large applications,
thereby saving many days, or even months, of programming labor.

THE CURRENT LINEUP

    According to IBM, only two IBM SystemView products are now
available: Workstation Data Save Facility/VM and NetView Graphic Monitor
Facility. About a baker's dozen more IBM products carry the inscrutable
label ''SystemView Conformance Announced.''
    Workstation Data Save Facility/VM is a remote backup application
based on the client-server model. It permits workstations running under
DOS, OS/2, or AIX to back up data on a central S/3X0 host running under VM.
The idea of using host computers as hyper file servers for data backup,
archiving, and retrieval is a sound one. For more than three decades, users
have been backing up and archiving S/3X0 host data, in some cases nightly.
Hence, there's a wealth of proven products, tools, procedures, policies,
and trained personnel in place to perform this crucial function on a
regular basis.
    The NetView Graphic Monitor Facility (NGMF) is an intrinsic feature
of NetView 2.1. It offers the graphical user interface of OS/2 Extended
Edition 1.2, with color-coded status messages. NGMF also provides
multilevel or hierarchical views of the complete network. A ''zoom-in''
feature gives the network operator an expanded view of either a portion of
the network or of individual components, such as Network Control Program
(NCP) Type 4 nodes or peripheral node physical units.
    This past September, IBM enhanced NGMF to include multivendor
support through what appears to be an ASCII emulation facility. NGMF now
addresses two key objectives of SystemView: Its user interface is compliant
with SystemView's end-use dimension, and it handles multivendor systems.
    Among the products labeled as ''SystemView Conformance Announced,''
the SAA Delivery Manager (DM) originally was hailed as a quintessential
SystemView product. SAA DM is a centralized software, document, and file
distribution service for networked OS/2 workstations. Its functions are
somewhat analogous to those of NetView DM, which offers delivery services
to PCs, AS/400s, S/36s processors, and VM hosts, among other IBM systems.
    The differences between SAA DM and NetView DM are intriguing. SAA
DM offers software license management and virus detection software
integration, workstation-oriented features that NetView DM now lacks. But
NetView DM works with a wider range of devices, including just about all
the strategic SAA remote platforms, while SAA DM works only with OS/2
workstations. All things considered, NetView DM appears to be the stronger
of the two products.
    IBM has acknowledged the overlap between SAA DM and NetView DM.
However, it has not specified any guidelines as to which product is more
strategic, or when to use one as opposed to the other. But most of IBM's
key SAA software development partners already have pledged their support to
SAA DM.
    SAA Asset Manager (AM) appears to be an initial implementation of
the business management discipline in SystemView's application dimension.
It provides an open database definition scheme that can be used to collect
data about all of an enterprise's resources in a central repository, as
well as a centralized, automated inventory management service for hardware,
software, and other resources.
    There is an obvious and acute need for such asset control in
distributed environments. However, just as with SAA DM, the announcement of
SAA AM begs a coexistence question. For the past two years, IBM has been
creating an asset tracking service, albeit for hardware only, for NetView
through its Network Asset Management facility. In this case, however, IBM
appears to have spotted the potential overlap between the SAA and NetView
offerings. Just before SAA AM was scheduled to ship, IBM pushed back the
release date of the product because of ''customer feedback.''
    On the positive side, SAA AM--when it becomes available--will
handle inventory management for any software distributed via SAA DM. This
is a clear signal that IBM is serious about tightly integrating all
SystemView applications.
    Both SAA DM and SAA AM rely on a new MVS and VM host-based product
called SAA Application Connection Services (AConnS). AConnS extends the
OS/2 EE Desktop Manager, icon, and resource manipulation environment to
embrace mainframe applications andresources. It lets users of OS/2
workstations directly invoke host applications and gives them direct access
to host-attached advanced function printers. With AConnS, an OS/2 user can
execute multiple applications concurrently, on separate windows. Such
applications can be any combination of local PS/2 applications, Logical
Unit 6.2 (SAA) cooperative processing applications, or 3270-based
(LU-to-LU) applications.

IBM PULLS SAA
OUT OF THE MIRE

By:
Anura Guruge, BBN Communications

There sure were times when IBM appeared unsure as to exactly what it wanted
to achieve with SAA, its proposed model for next-generation client-server
computing. But IBM never lost sight of the fact that both it and its
customers were in dire need of such a model.
    That's why Big Blue never seriously contemplated ditching SAA, as
so many industry analysts predicted. In fact, Big Blue has continually, if
not diligently, striven to strengthen SAA's technical infrastructure and
bolster its credibility. Its September 11 product blowout (over 100
products and services) is certainly in that tradition: 40 percent of that
blockbuster revolved around SAA. (The SystemView announcement is discussed
in detail on page 99.)
    From its 1987 inception, SAA had the basic framework and the right
repertoire of services to be a solid architectural platform for developing
IBM-centric applications. What got it into trouble was IBM's initial
preoccupation with promoting it as the means of attaining that holy grail
of contemporary computing: cross-platform application portability. Given
that the standard execution environment needed to achieve this portability
is only now beginning to appear, IBM's preemptive posturing left it with
lots of egg on its face. The embarrassing slips in the availability of
OfficeVision Version 2, dubbed the first SAA application, did nothing to
bolster SAA's credibility.
    Much to its credit, IBM has been successful in pulling SAA out of
the mire. The aforementioned September 11 extravaganza did a great deal to
dispel lingering doubts and reassert SAA's strategic significance. The
message is clear: SAA is here to stay and is set to follow in the
illustrious footsteps of SNA and the S/370 Principles of Operation.
    The three overriding precepts of the new SAA, which I've taken to
calling SAA Mark II, are client-server, workstation-host cooperative
processing; unrestricted transparent access to widely dispersed data; and
total system management of heterogeneous environments.
    This trio is key to realizing the workstation-based integrated
LAN/WAN computing model advocated by IBM and others. The entire
paradigm--from the design of the iconic user interfaces to the mechanisms
that permit consistent, reversible updates of multiple distributed
databases--is now synthesized, articulated, and implemented within the
context of SAA.
    The availability of SAA's Common Programming Interface for
Communications (CPI-C) across all six SAA platforms (MVS, VM, OS/400, OS/2,
CICS, and IMS) is a big step. At long last, a standard interprogram
communications service with the same API can be found on multiple
platforms.
    In parallel, major strides have been made in harnessing the
capabilities of the pivotal Distributed Relational Database Architecture
(DRDA), which has been part of SAA since 1988. DRDA specifies the protocols
with which a single transaction can access or update multiple, distributed,
remote databases. It also supplies fail-safe mechanisms to ensure the
integrity of all databases in the event that a transaction needs to be
rolled back.
    With the widespread use of DRDA and its file-oriented counterpart,
Distributed Data Management (DDM), it is possible to see a decline in the
indiscriminate file transfers routinely performed in IBM environments. But
the real problem associated with moving data, ignoring the vast amounts of
network and disk capacity consumed, is the loss of data synchronization and
security.
    DRDA makes it possible to access and update a single copy of any given
database in situ, irrespective of location or dispersion. Performance,
relative to local access, is the one drawback. The move toward networks
based on high-speed LANs interconnected by bridges and routers and the
steady decline in the cost of high-capacity WAN bandwidth, however, should
minimize this.
    A limited DRDA capability was announced on IBM's DB2 and VM SQL/DS
in September 1990, enabling a transaction to freely access multiple
databases but only update one. This September, a similar facility was
offered for the OS/2 Database Manager. Now an OS/2 user can access or
update relational databases on MVS, VM, and OS/400 hosts, treating those
databases as if they were local. While the exact future of OS/2 is murky,
it remains a major platform, and the DRDA facility gives it a compelling,
competitive edge.
    The Information Warehouse (IW), also announced in September, goes
even further in extending DRDA to non-IBM databases. Platform-independent
database manipulation is obviously of strategic interest to the large
number of IBM customers who are locked into IBM long-
term but starting to experiment with distributed databases available on
Unix open systems. IW, at least in theory, permits all such databases to be
transparently integrated.
    IW narrows the gap between SAA and Network Application Support
(NAS) from Digital Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.). A few years ago, NAS
and SAA, despite their obvious parallels, could not be accurately compared.
SAA was restricted to IBM platforms and appeared to be very
application-centric, while NAS was network-centric and geared to
integrating applications and data resident on diverse platforms on a DEC
server.
    With IW and its various interoperability ''viaducts'' (IBM lingo
for gateways) to Unix/AIX systems, SAA is slowly but surely attempting to
become more oriented toward open systems. There have been many hints from
IBM over the past couple of years that it intends to draw SAA and AIX even
closer together, cross-pollinating the two technologies. The inclusion of
the Open System Foundations's Unix-based Distributed Computing Environment
(DCE) within SAA is evidence of this move. It hasn't happened yet, but it
can't be too far away. The result would be SAA Mark III--an ''open'' SAA
that could stretch across SAA and Unix platforms.
    IW also furnishes more evidence of SAA's newfound respectability.
The hype that has accompanied earlier SAA adjuncts has been conspicuously
absent. This is a far cry from the IBM once determined to gain a clear
market lead, the one that charged ahead with the aggressive promotion of
SAA concepts and products with scant attention to maturity or
availability.
    In each case, this shoot-from-the-hip approach did more damage than
good. At least with IW it appears that the lessons learned so far are being
put into practice.
    All in all, SAA has come a long way in its four and a half years.
At a comparable age, SNA was just getting around to supporting its first
multihost networks. That was 13 years ago.
    Instead of writing off SAA, we'd be better off taking a closer
look--and the September 11 announcements are a good place to start. And
since I was responsible for dismissing SAA as the Hubble Telescope of the
computer industry, it's only appropriate that I take the lead in admitting
that where SAA is concerned, IBM has regained its focus.

START YOUR ENGINES FOR IMPROVED SNA PERFORMANCE

By:
Joe Mohen, Contributing Editor

In the racing pits of Indianapolis, a crew can change four tires, pump 40
gallons of fuel, and add an aerodynamic spoiler in nine seconds flat. Each
crew prides itself on the tricks it develops to squeeze the most work into
the least time. There's even a contest among pit crews, separate from the
car races, to determine who's fastest.
    Networking professionals are no different: They, too, devote
endless hours to shaving a second here or there off procedures like file
transfers. There aren't any formal competitions, but maybe there should be:
One of the most frequently traveled pathways, the SNA micro-to-
mainframe link, continues to be dogged by sluggish performance.
Off-the-shelf products can help turbocharge throughput, but the lesson
we've learned here at Team Mohen is that there's no link that wouldn't
benefit from some fine-tuning.
    Five years ago, most of us were happy just to be able to download
host files to our PCs, regardless of how long it took. Today it's a
different story. It's not uncommon for companies to quit using first-
generation micro-to-mainframe products because of their poor file transfer
rates. In one extreme case, a large U.S. bank went back to mailing floppy
disks because it took such a ridiculously long time to download
spreadsheets via modem.
    Another company, a large proxy house, had a production application
that required it to download an entire DB2 database, several gigabytes
long, to a file server every night. The only problem was that each
''nightly'' download took 27 hours! Obviously, that kind of rate is
unacceptable.
    The file transfer products in use at that time achieved throughputs
of only around 8 kbit/s. That's excruciatingly slow, considering that
thetoken ring adapter cards in the user's 3174 communications controllers
were running at 4 Mbit/s. Put another way, an average file transfer ran at
1/500th of the network data rate.

A TUNE-UP GOES A LONG WAY

    This user realized dramatic improvements in throughput by following
a few simple steps. The first thing was to correct the things that were
radically wrong with the environment:
Not using LU 6.2 for SNA batch transmissions. The protocol used by 3270
terminals, Logical Unit Type 2 (LU 2), is the worst possible choice for
file transfer. LU 2 limits message size--and thus the amount of information
it can transfer at a time--to one screen (usually 1,920 bytes). Sending
larger records means sending multiple messages. Worse, LU 2 requires the
receiving PC to acknowledge each message by emulating an ENTER keystroke
each time a screen is sent. Moreover, 3270 terminals cannot receive certain
binary strings, which means additional superfluous information has to be
sent to achieve data transparency. All in all, LU 2 imposes far too much
overhead for file transfers.
    Switching to the LU 6.2 protocol allowed messages of up to 32
kbytes to be sent without restriction. This alone quadrupled the
throughput.
Not using large token ring frame sizes. On this user's local token rings,
it took almost as much time to send a small message as it did a large one.
That's because the user had set a 265-byte maximum on each message, or
''frame'' as it's called at the data link level. We increased the frame
size to 1,929 bytes, and here the payoff was really impressive: Typically,
throughputs showed fourfold or fivefold increases. Over the wide area, the
improvement is more modest (usually it's in the 15 percent range), but it's
an improvement all the same. (Newer token ring boards now have enough
memory to support frames as large as 4 kbytes.)
Not using a fast processor. The speed of the local computer can be a major
factor in determining micro-to-mainframe throughput. If you want fast
transmissions, don't even think of using an 8088 or 80286.
Not using segmenting. Unlike the OSI model, which guarantees transparency
by isolating each of the seven layers from one another, IBM's SNA mixes
control information from three high-level layers into a single message
called a Request Unit (RU). In the vast world of IBM connectivity, the size
of the RU is the single most important parameter when it comes to
fine-tuning a link.
    As a rule, it pays to make the RU larger than the frame size. This
forces the RU messages to be broken into multiple frames in a process
called ''segmenting'' that boosts throughput. For this user--
and, in fact, for every other installation I've seen--segmenting produced a
50 percent boost in throughput on a LAN link and a 15 percent improvement
across an SDLC connection. Segmenting remains one of the best-kept secrets
of link tuning.
    When we were finished at this site, we got the user's transmission
time down from 27 hours to less than one hour. Effective throughput was
approximately 360 kbit/s--and that was without segmenting. When we employed
segmenting, throughput rose above the 500-kbit/s mark. The
micro-to-mainframe speeds that you're getting today are probably less than
a quarter of that.
    That's not to say there isn't any room left for improvement. Since
then, we've boosted throughput on 4-Mbit/s token ring LANs to more than 1
Mbit/s by using the very fast 3174-11 controller. This device is three
times faster than its predecessor, the 3174-011.
    Some of the things that seemingly would speed throughput can
actually slow it down. A good example is adaptive data compression. When
used with a slow processor, adaptive compression algorithms consume so many
processing cycles that throughput can actually decline, even though there's
less data to send. This problem isn't limited to low-end 8088 and 80286
machines; I've also found it to be true of certain minis, such as IBM's
System 36 and DEC's MicroVAX.
    I'm not suggesting by any meansthat compression should always be
turned off. But it does play an important role in throughput, and network
managers should check to see how it affects throughput before they set it
and forget it.

DO TRY THIS AT HOME

    Before fine-tuning your own token ring environment, first try to
determine what your optimum throughput can be. Right now, I believe the
optimum throughput using 3174 4-Mbit/s Token Ring Interface Controller is
about 1 Mbit/s, as described earlier. For a 3745 4-Mbit/s controller, the
upper limit is faster than 1 Mbit/s. In either event, you'll probably need
LU 6.2 to achieve these numbers.
    So should you run out and buy a 3745 to replace your 3174? Not
necessarily. The 3172 token ring interface is faster than either. And since
the 3172 can handle OSI and TCP as well as SNA, there's no longer a good
reason to buy those older alternatives. The embarrassing thing about the
3172 is that it's basically a $35,000 PS/2. McData Corp. (Broomfield,
Colo.) offers a strong alternative to the 3172 with prices in the low 20s.
    In the not-too-distant future, I believe throughput will approach
wire speeds. An IBM lab already has achieved rates of better than 3.8
Mbit/s on a 4-Mbit/s token ring using Network Services/2. And within five
years, we're likely to see wire speeds on 16-Mbit/s token ring LANs. Until
we see that checkered flag, though, there's still plenty of fine-
tuning to be done.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY

The DATA COMM User Survey on SNMP multivendor network management systems
comprised a two-page questionnaire and incentive mailed to a random sample
of 2,500 subscribers on July 8, 1991. Results are based on 175 valid
responses. The questionnaire listed 25 products from 24 vendors, with space
left for write-in mentions.
    Users were asked to rank their SNMP systems in order of importance
in their networks, number 1 being most important. Only products that were
ranked first or second in importance by more than 15 respondents were
included in the final tabulations. The ''Other'' category comprises
write-in candidates only; it does not include systems that drew fewer than
15 responses as the first or second most important products. Users then
were asked to rate their two most important SNMP systems in 14 technology
categories and in five service categories. The following scale was used: 5
= Excellent; 4 = Very Good; 3 = Good; 2 = Fair; and 1 = Poor. Users also
were asked to select a ratio that best described how they valued technology
versus service. They also were asked to describe the size of their
networks, the way they were using SNMP systems to manage network devices,
and the importance they would place on SNMP in managing their networks.
    Mean scores were calculated for each question by multiplying the
frequency of each rating by its value and dividing the result by the total
number of questions in either the technology or service categories. The
mean scores in both categories were then weighted according to the mean
percentage of importance given by the respondents--70 percent for
technology, and 30 percent for service. Winners in each category were
chosen after the weighted scores in both categories were averaged.
    Twenty products did not garner enough responses to be included in
the final tabulations. These were: the ACS 4800 from Advanced Computer
Communications (Santa Barbara, Calif.); the NetCentral Station from Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.); the ExpressView system from David
Systems Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif.); the Eye*Node from Digital Analysis Corp.
(Reston, Va.); the DECmcc Management Station for Ultrix from Digital
Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.); the MONET system, formerly the HLS 9100,
from Hughes LAN Systems (Mountain View, Calif.); the Lance Network
Management System now offered by Micro Technology Inc.'s Lexcel subsidiary
(Fullerton, Calif.); the NCRNet Manager, provided on a request basis by
AT&T (New York) and formerly sold by NCR Corp. (Dayton, Ohio); the
DualManager from Netlabs Inc. (Los Angeles); the Series 5000 from Network
Equipment Technologies Inc. (NET, Redwood City, Calif.); the OverView
system from Proteon Inc. (Westborough, Mass.); the LANcentral Express from
Racal-InterLan (now Racal-Datacom Inc., Sunrise, Fla.); the MultiMan system
from RAD Network Devices Inc. (RND, Huntington Beach, Calif.); the 5025
Network Management Center from Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.); the LattisNet
Network Management System from SynOptics Communications Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.); the TIME/LAN 100 Element Management System from Timeplex Inc.
(Woodcliff Lake, N.J.); the NetDirector from Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.); the WANmanager from Vitalink Communications Corp. (Fremont,
Calif.); the Wellfleet SNMP-NMS from Wellfleet Communications Inc.
(Bedford, Mass.); and the Management Station from The Wollongong Group Inc.

THE BENEFITS--AND DRAWBACKS--
OF GROWING YOUR OWN

Since SNMP's introduction in 1988, information about the protocol has been
readily available to Internet users, and the source code has been offered
from vendors such as Performance Systems International Inc. (PSI, Reston,
Va.). Armed with this code, users can design and build their own SNMP
management systems--and according to the DATA COMM User Survey, that's
exactly what some respondents have done. Since most commercial SNMP systems
are just barely out of the gate, homegrown systems have been an attractive
alternative in these early days of SNMP.
    ''We just didn't find exactly what we wanted in commercial systems
when we looked at them last year,'' says Ron M. Hoffmann, assistant network
manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Mass.).
Hoffmann says his group found products that looked like they'd perform well
in smaller networks, but not in a setup the size of MIT's. That network
comprises more than 4,000 Ethernet nodes attached to a fiber distributed
data interface (FDDI) backbone and segmented by Cisco routers.
    The MIT group used software from NYSERNet Inc. (Syracuse, N.Y.) to
construct Unix-based SNMP tools that perform a number of functions, among
them turning specific nodes on and off and gathering information from
routers and repeaters in the network.
    The difficulty of constructing an SNMP management system from
scratch may be one reason why the customized systems didn't fare as well in
the overall ratings as the commercial systems did. In ease of
customization, however, the Other group ranked fourth with a score of 3.30,
after Hewlett-Packard, DEC, and Novell, and before Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Cabletron Systems Inc. The obvious conclusion: If you develop your own
software, it's easier to modify it.--M.J.

USERS RATE SNMP MULTIVENDOR NETWORK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
In a new market, users are still
figuring out what SNMP management
can do for them

By:
Mary Jander, Data Communications

Vendors of network management systems may proclaim this the Age of SNMP
Management Over Every Last Device on Earth, but according to the DATA COMM
User Survey of SNMP multivendor management systems, that just isn't the
case--at least not yet.
    To be sure, network managers would love to control many different
devices, from many different vendors, with a single, easy-
to-use system. Survey respondents believe simple network management
protocol systems will bring that dream closer to reality. They're quick to
add, however, that the systems are simply too new and their experience with
them too limited for anyone to declare that SNMP management of multivendor
networks is an essential, or even widely accepted, part of networking.
    Many readers are still in the process of evaluating one or more
systems on isolated network segments. Indeed, almost half of the 320
readers who responded to the DATA COMM survey haven't even gotten to the
testing stage yet, although most say they plan to use SNMP systems in the
future.
    One reason for users' general lack of experience with SNMP systems
is that these systems are relatively new: Novell Inc.'s LANtern Services
Manager shipped in March 1991; DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module
became available in November 1990; Cabletron Systems Inc.'s Remote
LANview/Windows was first equipped with SNMP management capabilities in
July 1990, although it debuted in September 1989; HP's Network Node Manager
shipped in May 1990; and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s SunNet Manager shipped in
March 1990, making this 21-month-old program the most venerable in the
field.
    Even the simple network management protocol itself is fairly new.
Devised in 1988 by Internet scientists to manage devices in TCP/IP
networks, SNMP has not been extended far beyond its original charter.
Several Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) groups are working on
extensions that will allow SNMP to manage more types of devices, but it
will take time for these improvements to filter down to users.
    While many survey respondents had yet to make a final commitment to
a single SNMP system, they did seem pleased with the current crop of
products. The five systems that made the final tabulation rarely rated
below a score of Good, and no system ranked less than Fair in any category.
Because the scores were so close, and because many of the systems were
still being evaluated, DATA COMM selected just one
winner--Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager.
    HP's product fared well in both technology and service ratings,
achieving the highest overall score and the top ranking in the technology
categories. Notably, the Network Node Manager scored solid ratings where
other systems stumbled, particularly in categories such as management
information base (MIB) extensibility and utilities, a key area for
multivendor network management. HP's product also did well in degree of
automation, availability and quality of user-defined reporting facilities,
emergency support, and application development and systems integration
services.
    Digital Equipment Corp.'s DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module
garnered the second-highest overall score. It had the top ratings in the
service categories, leading all other vendors in documentation, maintenance
and repair, and training.
    DEC's solid service record was unusual: The other systems included
in the ratings did better in technology than in service. Scores were
highest in the technology categories of ease of use, ease of installation,
and overall system performance (see Table 1).

TIES THAT BIND

    Despite the newness of the systems, the survey did reveal some
clear patterns among users of SNMP systems:
Many users acquired their systems mainly because they already had equipment
from the system vendor--Cabletron hubs, for instance, or Novell LANs--
even though all the systems surveyed are billed as multivendor managers.
Most were looking at other products too, and many were investigating the
possibilities of altering or customizing their existing systems with the
help of vendors or consultants.
Users haven't yet harnessed the full power of their management systems.
Many survey respondents said they rely on their systems only to report
trouble, even though the systems also perform trend analysis and active
monitoring. When the network is running smoothly, many respondents simply
ignore their SNMP systems. Part of the blame for users' lack of awareness
rests with the vendors, which according to users could do a better job of
bringing them up to speed on their technology.
Workstations and PCs are by far the most common type of device managed,
according to nearly four-fifths of survey respondents (see Table 2). The
second most widely managed class of devices is LAN servers, by 59.22
percent of users.
Besides the users who were still testing their systems, many said they are
undecided or ambivalent about keeping their SNMP management systems
permanently.
SNMP is gaining the most ground in small networks and in portions of larger
ones. Users are trying out SNMP systems in departments or selected LAN
segments before adopting them throughout their enterprises.
    Fully 68 percent of users surveyed said they were using SNMP
systems to manage less than 10 sites. Another 9.7 percent are using SNMP to
manage from 11 to 20 sites, and only 8 percent are using SNMP to manage
more than 21 sites. The mean of all responses was just 10.1 sites.
    The number of devices managed at these sites is also small. Nearly
half of all respondents, 48.6 percent, said they manage less than 50
devices with an SNMP system. Less than a quarter of respondents, 22.3
percent, manage 50 to 100 devices with an SNMP system; 15.4 percent manage
100 to 500 devices, 7.4 percent manage 500 to 1,000 devices, and just 4.0
percent said they manage more than 1,000 devices. The mean number of
devices managed is 185.1.
Network management of all types--not just SNMP--accounts for a relatively
small part of the typical communications budget. Survey respondents said
only 32.1 percent of their budgets goes toward network management, with 12
percent of this devoted to salaries for network management personnel, 11.6
percent allocated to the management systems themselves, and 8.5 percent
assigned to management services, including outsourcing.

THE DAWN OF MULTIVENDOR SUPPORT

    Support of multiple vendors' internetworking gear is still a
relatively new feature, and one that few survey respondents had explored at
any great length.
    Until this spring, all of the products listed were capable of
supporting only basic SNMP alarm information from nonproprietary gear.
Although most vendors could and would add support for other vendors' MIBs
on a custom basis, most systems only understand MIB I, the set of general
definitions that describe a device's functions to an SNMP system.
    That began changing this year, when vendors started adding MIB
compilers that can accept and manage a range of devices from multiple
vendors. SunNet Manager Release 1.1, which shipped in February, includes a
translation utility that allows users to compile other vendors' MIBs,
including those that include proprietary extensions. Version 2.0 of
Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager, which shipped last spring,
adds a MIB compiler to the system's Application Builder software. The
software accepts any MIB and loads it automatically into the HP system's
graphical user interface.
    DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module currently accepts only
basic alarm and status information from network devices that support MIB I.
DEC says it will offer a MIB compiler with the second release of the SNMP
Access Module, slated to ship by the end of the year. This new release also
will support MIB II and will come with several proprietary MIBs already
incorporated into the system. MIB II supports more types of devices than
MIB I does--most notably T1 transmission devices and a range of LAN media
types--and it provides more extensive management control.
    Novell's LANtern Services Manager also displays only basic alarm
information from non-Novell devices that support MIB I. The LANtern
Services Manager is an interface for Novell's LANtern monitoring device
that oversees one Ethernet segment at a time. The LANtern can send its
information to a range of other SNMP-based systems, including the
Hewlett-Packard and Sun systems. There have been rumors that Novell will
soon offer a MIB compiler for use with the LANtern Services Manager, but
Novell won't confirm this.

SEND HELP

    Users have mixed feelings about how well vendors are helping them
meet specific network management requirements. Most respondents said they
are interested in modifying their SNMP systems to manage more types of
devices, run on a different platform, or perform capabilities generally not
offered by their SNMP system out of the box. These comments send a clear
message to vendors: Send more, and better, help.
    Hewlett-Packard, DEC, and Novell products received relatively good
marks for ease of customization, but all vendors' scores dropped for
database capabilities, availability and quality of user-defined reporting
facilities, and MIB extensibility and utilities. A notable exception was
Hewlett-Packard's score of 3.69 for MIB extensibility and utilities.
    In some instances, users said they'd asked for hands-on assistance
in modifying their systems--a need that was not always met. ''Cabletron
could give us better service in showing us how to adjust the system,'' says
William Vilwock, computer specialist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines field
office in Spokane, Wash. Vilwock's group is using Cabletron's Remote
LANview/Windows on a 114-node Ethernet that comprises local and remote
sites. The group needs to extend the network to incorporate non-Cabletron
WAN equipment, and Vilwock say it's been slow going.
    A user of the Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager also
said he'd like more support. ''HP hasn't been here in over a year,'' said
this technician, who requested anonymity and whose group is using
Hewlett-Packard's product to monitor a 400-node Ethernet network. ''The
Network Node Manager is a reasonably good product that covers the basics
and provides diagnostics. But the graphics aren't that customizable, and
we'd like to add more graphical features.''
    In contrast, another user said Hewlett-Packard was extremely
helpful in showing his organization how to create Unix-based applications
that allow the HP OpenView Network Node Manager to respond to network
problems. ''On a Unix workstation, I can easily program a routine that
activates a beeping pager if something goes wrong,'' says Randy J. Miller,
systems support analyst at Union Carbide Coatings Service Inc.
(Indianapolis). Miller describes his installation as ''an HP shop from way
back.''
    Another user reported that his vendor, DEC, was taking more time
than he'd like in considering changes that he had requested. Dave Dorosz,
systems engineer at Phillips Laboratories (Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford,
Mass.), is using DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module to manage a lab
network containing 10 bridged Ethernet segments comprising DEC bridges and
routers and computers from several vendors. He said his group is satisfied
with the system, but would like more capabilities, including an automatic
node discovery tool--software that is capable of locating and graphically
depicting devices with IP addresses in a network. The group also wants to
monitor network traffic across bridges through the Access Module, instead
of using a separate dedicated DEC LANbridge to collect network traffic
statistics for the DECmcc Director system. The group also would like to
runthe DECmcc Director system and its access modules on a Sun workstation.
    The Phillips Labs group is evaluating a range of other SNMP
systems, not because DEC hasn't been helpful, but because it's simply
taking too long for DEC to decide about adding these functions to its
system, Dorosz says.
    Users clearly want vendors to help them expand their systems, and
many are ready to go elsewhere if they can't get what they need from one
system. In fact, most users contacted were evaluating more than one system
or were thinking about doing so. Some users are willing to create their own
systems to get what they need (see ''The Benefits--and Drawbacks--of
Growing Your Own'').

SERVICE WOES

    As noted, the SNMP systems included in the final tabulation scored
worse in service than in technology categories. The lone exception was the
DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module, the only product to post higher overall
scores for service than for technology. Users' satisfaction with DEC's
service is reflected in first-place ratings for overall service, training,
vendor documentation, and maintenance and repair. One user complimented DEC
on its commitment to service and commented that ''a DEC representative
camps out in our data center when something goes wrong.''
    Hewlett-Packard also did comparatively well in the service
categories, although its showing was not as strong as in the technology
ratings. Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager scored first in
the emergency support category and in application development and systems
integration, and it placed second to DEC in overall service and in
maintenance and repair.
    In follow-up interviews, users' service complaints included gripes
that vendors had sold them a system and then deserted them, relied too much
on third-party support, or provided introductory training and then failed
to deliver adequate help in a pinch.
    Emergency support scores were lower than anywhere else in the
survey ratings, and Novell users were especially vocal. Unlike the other
four vendors, who rely on telephone service or sales reps to perform
maintenance and repairs, Novell relies on third-party consultants, who
charge what they want to for service. Novell maintains a hot-line service,
but if users can't get a problem fixed on the hot-
line, they must rely on these third-party representatives to get the job
done. Some users are unhappy with this setup because it puts them at the
mercy of local services--and the high prices they typically charge.
    One LAN administrator complained that even if she calls the Novell
representative in her area and talks for only 10 minutes, she still must
pay a $75 hourly fee. When trouble hit, it was expensive. ''Novell is great
on training and provides hot-line service for their products, but when our
Novell system needed work, we had to hire the $75-an-hour consultant Novell
assigned to us,'' this user says. The consultant's bill, added to the cost
of network downtime, made this particular repair job an unpleasant
experience.
    Vendor documentation was another weak spot. H.L. Wilson,
information systems manager at the U.S. Naval Air Station (Pensacola, Fla.)
and a user of Novell's LANtern Services Manager, says that documentation
from Novell and other vendors is better than it used to be but not as good
as it should be. ''Sometimes I get instructions that don't match the
version of software I'm using, but seem to have been written before it was
enhanced,'' Wilson says.

FIRST AND LAST

    The highest score in the survey went to Hewlett-Packard: 3.89 for
ease of use. The lowest score in the survey was Cabletron's 2.69 rating for
the service category of application development and systems integration.
    The Cabletron ratings were the most uneven in the survey. They
ranged from a first-place score of 3.83 for ease of installation and a
second-place score of 3.83 for ease of use--two of the highest scores in
the findings--to last-place ratings for ease of customization, degree of
automation, security, and application development.
    Cabletron's latest SNMP system, Spectrum, wasn't listed in the DATA
COMM survey form because it just began shipping when the survey was
conducted and consequently hadn't had time to build up a substantial
installed base (see ''Survey Methodology''). Cabletron says Spectrum does
address the very areas where users felt Remote LANview/Windows is weak.
Application development and systems integration are key functions of
Spectrum, and the vendor already has ported the system to a range of Unix
platforms.
    In fairness, the ease-of-use rating turned out to be uniformly high
for all of the vendors, and the category for application development and
systems integration was similarly low for all.

Best Overall
HP OpenView
Network Node Manager

Top scores in far more categories than any other product gave
Hewlett-Packard the top honors in this DATA COMM User Survey. Introduced in
May 1990, HP's network manager is among the oldest products surveyed and
now is in its second release. It runs on HP workstations under HP/UX and on
Sun Sparcstations under SunOS. HP's software finished first in nine out of
14 technology categories and shared first place with Sun's SunNet Manager
for best graphical user interface. Users particularly liked the product's
MIB extensibility and utilities, which enable them to manage other vendors'
devices.

BILLING FOR LAN INTERNETS:
WHO PICKS UP THE TAB?

By:
Robin Layland, Travelers Insurance Co.

Ah, the joys of internetworking: Now that LANs are no longer strictly local
affairs, it's up to the corporate telecom department to decide who foots
the bill for all that connectivity. But when corporate starts asking
questions about utilization, it's funny how every department or workgroup
suddenly seems to be a ''below average'' user. And they want their bills to
reflect that.
    Strange how the same folks usually seem to be demanding more
bandwidth.
    Since all the parties on the network agree that someone else is
using the network more than them, a simple approach would be to charge
everyone the same amount. This one-bill-fits-all tack is a surefire way to
get everyone equally upset, but it's not going to accomplish much else.
    On SNA installations, bills are tallied using data collected by
performance-monitoring tools such as IBM's NetView Performance Monitor
(NPM). When all those below-average users complain about their charges,
you show them the hard data on utilization.
    But LAN internetworking isn't SNA networking. IBM's NPM doesn't
gather the needed information on network usage, which brings us full
circle: How are internetworking bills to be generated? How do you prove
that some of those below-average users are really above average?
    Obviously, what's needed is a billing data collection system for
internets. But don't run out to your internetwork equipment vendor (whether
it specializes in bridges, routers, or analyzers) and expect to find one.
Even Nick Lippis doesn't have one.
    While it may sound logical for bridge or router vendors to supply
the gear needed to collect billing data, they don't see it that way. In
fact, most don't seem to consider billing an important issue.
    Some router vendors may try to convince you to use their product's
TCP/IP accounting feature, which keeps track of TCP/IP addresses. That's
fine if everyone is using TCP/IP (they aren't) or if a TCP/IP subnet is
directly equal to one billing group. In most cases, though, the subnet is
shared by many departments, and they don't want to see their bills
combined.
    You could solve the problem by adapting something on the market
(like a LAN analyzer) and writing your own billing application. Of course,
you'd probably have to deploy one of these devices on every LAN, which adds
up to more work and expense than most corporate telecom departments want to
get involved in.
    But imagine just for a moment that we've actually convinced
internetworking vendors to solve the billing problem. Before they deliver
the solution, they're going to ask some questions of their own, starting
with: ''What type of billing system do you want?''
    A usage-based system sounds like a good answer, but it's not that
simple.
    There are two basic models for usage-based billing in a LAN internet.
The first is very similar to the way the local telephone company generally
bills its users. There's a set fee that permits an unlimited number of
local calls and a usage-sensitive (and distance-sensitive) charge for
long-distance calls. On an internet, this approach would translate into an
unlimited number of packets within a locally bridged building or campus
and a per- packet charge when communications lines are involved (long
distance).
    With this scheme, a person sending one message to someone on
another floor in the same building would pay the same set monthly fee as
someone who sends a hundred messages to another floor. When communications
lines are employed, there would be a charge for every message. Much like
long-distance calls, the more you send, the more you pay. This model makes
sense because the cost of the bridge or router that ties together local
subnets doesn't vary with the amount of traffic flowing across it. But
communication costs do increase as the amount of data sent increases.
    Thus, a department need only be concerned that its clients and
servers are located within the same bridged building or campus, not that
they are all on the same LAN. Further, users are not restricted as to where
they can be located, as long as they stay within the same locally bridged
area.
    The second approach to usage-based billing is closer to what the
local telephone company would like to do. Users are charged for every call
outside of their LAN. The more any group sends, the more it pays.
    With this approach, keeping costs down means keeping everyone in a
department on the LAN. This can lead to some interesting design challenges:
Departments with people on more than one floor will want all of them on the
same LAN. And when people move, departments will want to make sure they
stay on the same LAN.
    Once network managers have sorted out how to implement a
usage-based scheme, they still have to decide whether the billing rates
will be based on distance.
    A distance-sensitive approach does have some fundamental appeal,
and it's certainly familiar. A long-distance call from New York to Los
Angeles costs more than one from New York to Boston. The communications
line from New York to Los Angeles costs more.
    A distance-sensitive scheme is more important when every message
that leaves the LAN is billed for. Users who send a lot of messages between
floors won't be happy to learn their bills are the same as those for users
who send messages across the country.
    There are drawbacks. It's going to eat up a lot of memory tracking
who sent what to whom. And it's also going to lower performance in packets
per second. Add to this the cost of transmitting all that distance-related
data to the centralized billing system, and a distance-sensitive approach
could quickly run into money. Yes, it can lead to a ''fairer'' billing
system, but the question remains what that fairness is worth.
    It's also possible to use an external monitor to track all the
billing data. Here again, that monitor is going to need enough horsepower
to deal with distance-related data, which means it's going to be a pricey
piece of equipment.
    What's best for each corporation is an individual matter. The
problem is, vendors are not going to develop a different system for every
customer. They're big fans of the one-size-fits-all school of thinking. But
which size is it going to be?
    Making billing-data collection an option in routers is the best
answer. Asking for the distance-sensitive approach is tempting but
impractical. Vendors won't like distance-sensitive billing since it demands
so much storage and affects performance.
    If you believe accounting is important, then the most important
thing to do is ask your vendor to provide it. If they don't know you want
it, they're not going to spend much time trying to figure out how to
implement it.
    One reason that billing hasn't been a hot button for vendors may
simply be because LAN internetworking is still a fairly new idea. But that
attitude will change as LAN internets grow and management demands more
accountability.
    If we don't start telling vendors what we want, though, it's going
to get even harder justifying all the money that goes to internets and
explaining to all those below-average users why they should be paying
average rates.

A COMPLETE INTERNET
IN A SINGLE BOX
ODS's server module puts all networking devices
under one cover

By:
Mary Jander

Mention ''LAN server'' to most network managers and they'll conjure an
image of an oversized PC, probably in a tower case with 18 drive bays.
Mention ''internetworking'' and they'll think of more boxes--bridges,
gateways, routers--not to mention the network management system and snarl
of cables needed to connect them all.
    Optical Data Systems Inc. (ODS) has a better idea: Its ODS
Connection Server modules put multiple 80386-based LAN servers inside the
same box as a hub or token ring multiple access unit (MAU), so all the
equipment needed for local networking resides in a single device no larger
than a desktop PC.
    Up to six server modules can reside in one ODS 295 or 296 Modular
System hub chassis, with up to 350 Mbytes of hard disk storage in each
module. Up to 1.2 Gbytes of disk storage can be added with extra cards.
    The combination of servers, interface cards, and other connectivity
gear in a single box gives network managers another important
benefit--fewer devices to be managed. A optional card furnishes a simple
network management protocol (SNMP) agent that allows all the gear in a hub
to be managed by ODS's LanVision and by third-party SNMP managers. The
card also contains an agent for management by IBM's NetView, but only when
using ODS's token ring network interface cards (NICs). When used in ODS's
841 and 861 MAUs, the Connection Server consolidates all devices needed
for 4- and 16-Mbit/s token ring LANs. Both MAUs can handle fiber optic as
well as copper wiring, and both run under IBM's OS/2-based LAN Manager 2.0
and Token-Ring Bridge Program 2.2.
    Both the hub and the MAU versions of the ODS Connection Server run
under Novell Inc.'s NetWare 3.11, Banyan Systems Inc.'s Vines, IBM's LAN
Server, Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager, and 3Com Corp.'s 3+Open and 3+Share
network operating systems (NOSs).
    Putting the server inside the hub or MAU lets users take advantage
of a wider range of Novell's networking and net management products. For
example, users can plug Novell's Link/T1 and Link/64 WAN cards into the
hub, and at the same time use Novell's SNA gateway and server management
features.
    And by supporting several NOSs, the Connection Server allows
third-party NICs to be added quickly to its hubs. All that's required is
for the cards be compatible with the hubs' PC/AT-based buses.
    Before, the vendor supplied preconfigured, third-party cards for
T1, X.25, SNA, and 56-kbit/s WAN connections. Without ODS's assistance,
users would have to write their own NOS drivers.
    As with the expanded Novell options, the Connection Server cuts
down on card costs by handling any cards for operating systems compatible
with its AT bus. Users can save processing power by putting only the
runtime version of a NOS in the server.
    ODS's all-in-one approach is a novel one. Other hub vendors,
including Cabletron Systems Inc. (Rochester, N.H.), SynOptics
Communications Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), and Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.), provide NICs and other add-in modules only from
manufacturers that have alliances with them.
    In a twist on the ODS concept, Novell (Provo, Utah) plans to announce
an architecture in which a hub card runs inside a NetWare server. While
this is the exact opposite of the ODS design, Novell's architecture will
achieve the same ends--consolidation of networking devices and
improvements in net management.
   Novell apparently plans to help vendors such as Cabletron create hub
cards that can run on a PC/AT bus, thus tapping the PC's power supply, disk
space, and operating system. Novell will show vendors how to write NetWare
Loadable Module (NLM) agents for SNMP management systems and for NetWare
that will let their hubs be managed byNetWare or SNMP. At press time,
Novell said it had already enlisted the support of 19 hub vendors,
including Cabletron and SynOptics, that would build hub cards using the
Novell specs.
    The ODS Connection Server won't meet the needs of every customer.
Since the only generally available processor is a single Intel 20-MHz 80386
to 33-MHz 80386 and maximum disk storage is 1.2 Gbytes, users with
processor-intensive database requirements or applications with large files,
such as CAD/CAM, had best stick with their current servers. ODS says it
will supply 80286 and 80486 processors on special request.
    Joe Head, ODS senior vice president and cofounder, says he hopes
users will adopt a ''Chinese menu'' approach to the ODS Connection Server.
''We want users to just tell us what they need, and we'll put it into the
box,'' Head says.
    Early users of the ODS Connection Server are attracted by its space
savings and, because it consolidates network devices, its ability to make
LANs more manageable.
    At the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School
(Westwood), LAN manager Bill Rollins tested the ODS Connection Server as a
possible means of reducing the number of dedicated servers in the campus
network. The UCLA Medical School network is based in part on a 16-Mbit/s
fiber optic token ring backbone linked by ODS 841 MAUs. Rollins considered
putting the ODS Connection Server into these MAUs, thereby saving users in
smaller departments the cost of purchasing a server.
    Rollins says the option performed well in tests. He says the server
option is particularly good for users who don't know much about
networking--since everything is included in one hub unit, there isn't much
to set up or fuss with.
    Users can manage their ODS hubs and MAUs in several ways. An
optional management agent card contains SNMP agent software for the ODS
295/296 hubs or 841/861 MAUs and NetView agents for the token ring
connections. This card doesn't take up space that could otherwise be
devoted to network interface cards; rather, it fits into a special,
separate slot in the hub or MAU. The card costs about $3,200 for either
type of system. ODS token ring NICs also can send alerts to IBM's
LAN Manager 2.0 program. When IBM ships its LAN Network Manager replacement
for LAN Manager 2.0 next year, alerts from ODS token ring NICs will be sent
to that system, where they can be filtered and consolidated before being
transmitted to NetView.
    ODS also is working on a NetView/PC proxy agent that will run on
the Connection Server and allow ODS hubs to take advantage of NetView/PC
applications from IBM and third parties in the future. ODS's token ring
NICs and bridges can be controlled by the IBM Token-Ring Bridge Program,
just like IBM's own products.
    Each ODS 295/296 hub and 841/861 MAU also has a dedicated slot for a
card with an EIA-232 connection for out-of-band network management and
diagnostics. Out-of-band testing lets users perform troubleshooting even
if a network crashes. Users also can dedicate one of the LAN segments in
the ODS 295 or 296 chassis to handling management information via an ODS
network management card, thus isolating management from any user's data
stream--an attractive option where security is a concern.
    The ODS Connection Server module comes in different versions for
the hub and MAU. The hub version takes up two card slots in an ODS 295 or
296 chassis. Its components are an Intel 80386 processor; 16 Mbytes of RAM;
an Interactive Data Entry (IDE) hard disk controller; a 3.5-inch hard disk
with a capacity of up to 350 Mbytes right on the card; a floppy disk
controller; and controllers and interfaces for a keyboard and VGA monitor.
    The module fits into the 295 or 296 chassis without switching or
rewiring, ODS says. The vendor cautions, however, that users planning to
perform their own upgrades should know how to configure the drivers that
address the various devices in the hub.
    The total number of ports supported depends on how many NICs reside
in thehub chassis along with the Connection Server. If ODS's own NICs are
used exclusively, a 295 or 296 chassis with the Connection Server can house
up to 120 10Base-T ports; up to 80 thin Ethernet ports; up to 60 attachment
unit interface (AUI) ports; or up to 140 fiber optic interrepeater link
(FOIRL) ports. The hubs also can house up to 160 ports on 4- or 16-Mbit/s
token rings using fiber optic or shielded or unshielded twisted-pair copper
wiring. The number of ports available from third-party NICs depends on the
configurations of those cards.
    Server modules for ODS's 841 and 861 occupy three of the five
slots. One card holds the 80386 CPU and 16 Mbytes of RAM; one contains the
keyboard and VGA interface and floppy disk controller; the third houses the
hard disk controller.
    Unlike the ODS hubs, the 841 and 861 MAUs support IBM's Micro Channel
as well as its PC/AT-bus architecture, and ODS offers 4- and 16-Mbit/s
token ring cards for both kinds of buses. However, it's not as easy to
install NICs in the MAUs as it is in the hubs. A screwdriver and some
know-how with DIP switches may be required.

Product Summary
Product Name: ODS Connection Server module.

Description: A full-fledged LAN server for ODS 295 and 296 hubs and ODS 841
and 861 multiple access units (MAUs).

Vendor: Optical Data Systems Inc., 11-1 E. Arapaho Rd., Richardson, Texas
75081.

Pricing: Depending on hub and options chosen, about $5,000 to $15,000 per
hub or MAU. A hub with Connection Server module and LAN/WAN connections
costs an average of $13,000. A similarly configured MAU costs an average of
$9,000 to $10,000.

Availability: November 1991.

Advantages: Up to six servers can be placed inside an ODS 295/296 hub,
putting server, hub, and LAN ports in one device and simplifying network
management.

Disadvantages: Server modules use a single processor. Also, as options
mount, so does the cost of the hub or MAU.

HUBS WITH A FUTURE

By:
Mary Jander

ADC/Fibermux Corp. has added features to its Crossbow line of intelligent
networking hubs that it says will help organizations planning to migrate to
FDDI or simply needing to extend their LANs.
    The new Crossbow Plus hub includes four more I/O slots, more
powerful I/O modules, and higher-capacity power supplies for support of
fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) cards. Crossbow Plus accommodates
up to 14 Fibermux cards, compared to two, four, or 10 cards for older
Crossbow chassis. The vendor says it will use all existing Crossbow cards,
including those supporting Ethernet, token ring, and AppleTalk LANs, as
well as cards supporting Ethernet-to-Ethernet bridging and management via
Fibermux's own LightWatch simple network management protocol (SNMP)
system.
    Crossbow Plus handles up to 210 Ethernet workstations using
Fibermux's new high-density Ethernet I/O modules, which also run in the
older Crossbow hubs. The new hubs come with up to four 25-amp power
supplies, compared with two available for previous models. Along with five
cooling fans, the power supplies will allow the hub to support FDDI in the
future. Crossbow Plus is rack-mountable and measures 17.5 inches high by 15
inches deep. It is scheduled to ship this month for $1,550. Each power
supply module costs $950.
    ADC/Fibermux also announced the CC6613Z/16, a more powerful
Ethernet I/O module for Crossbow hubs that features 16 ports for 10Base-T
connections. The new module fits in all Crossbow hubs, including older
models as well as the Crossbow Plus. Previous Crossbow 10Base-T modules
only handled up to 10 ports. The CC6613Z/16 also is slated to ship this
month for $2,100.
    Finally, ADC/Fibermux announced a mini-hub called the Crossbow
Extend24 that supports workstations in Ethernet star topologies located
more than 330 feet from the main 10Base-T hub. The Extend24 takes the place
of 24 unshielded twisted-pair cables running from the main hub,
ADC/Fibermux says. The unit measures 1.75 by 11.5 inches, and can be
rack-mounted. Two models are available: The first offers a 50-pin telco
connector supporting 24 10Base-T ports, plus attachment unit interface
(AUI) ports for thick and thin Ethernet connections, for $3,200. The second
model furnishes two fiber optic interrepeater link (FOIRL) ports and an AUI
thick Ethernet connector. It costs $3,325. Optional nonvolatile RAM that
stores network configurations and addressing information for either
Extend24 model costs $100. Like the other products, the Extend24 unit is
slated to ship this month.

FIBER AND 10BASE-T HUBS BOW

By:
Mary Jander

Network Resources Corp. (NRC) has added fiber optic and 10Base-T products
to its MultiGate line of intelligent hubs for Ethernet LANs. The fiber hub
conforms to the fiber optic interrepeater link (FOIRL) standard being
developed for IEEE 802.3 Ethernets. The second is a 12-port version of
NRC's existing 10Base-T Ethernet hub with an integral learning/filtering
bridge.
    Both hubs come with the vendor's MultiGate Manager system. NRC says
both support open systems connections, in that both can be managed by a
range of other vendors' systems and both feature backplanes and media
connections that comply with industry standards.
    The MultiGate Intelligent Fiber Optic Hub allows users to connect
other hubs and devices with FOIRL support in a star topology. The hub can
be configured with four, eight, or 12 fiber optic ports. Backbone ports
support thick and thin Ethernet or thin Ethernet and FOIRL.
    The 10-pound hub, which measures 1.75 by 17 by 13.5 inches,
supports 50-, 62.5-, and 100-micron fiber optic cabling at distances of up
to 1.2 miles. It has 32 LED indicators and can be monitored by a dumb
terminal or NRC's MultiGate Manager, which offers alarms, graphics, and
multiwindow monitoring. The hub provides port-by-port event summaries and
historical and real-time reports. The 12-port version of the
IntelligentFiber Optic Hub costs $6,595. An eight-port version costs
$4,995, and a four-port version costs $3,395.
    NRC's 10Base-T hub connects computers over unshielded twisted-pair
wiring in a star topology, and it supports up to 12 Ethernet ports. A
bridge filters traffic between the hub and backbone networks by protocol
and address. The approximate filtering rate for this bridge is 10,000
packets per second, the fowarding rate is 5,000 packets per second. All
aspects of the hub, which is the same size as the FOIRL version, can be
remotely configured using the MultiGate Manager or the hub's external
management port. The hub costs $2,495.

TOKEN RING LINKS FOR DEC ULTRIX

By:
Mary Jander

The ACP 3300 host adapter from ACC Systems connects Digital Equipment Corp.
workstations running under Ultrix directly to a token ring network without
the need for an intermediate server, according to the vendor. The adapter
complies with the IEEE 802.2 and 802.5 standards and works with both 4- and
16-Mbit/s token rings. The ACP 3300 also uses the routing capabilities
built into the Ultrix kernel, enabling a DEC workstation to act as an
Ethernet LAN gateway to the token ring for other computers on the
workstation's native LAN.
    The standalone box comes with a Motorola 68000 processor and 512
kbytes of RAM. Software included with the adapter performs power-up
diagnostics and installation verification. A driver for VAX VMS systems
also is available. The ACP 3300 costs $5,250.

FDDI SPEEDS
ON UTP

By:
Mary Jander

The T100A network adapter from PC Office Inc. matches the performance of
fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) networks by providing data rates of
up to 100 Mbit/s over unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) wiring, according to
the vendor. The adapter is a 16-bit PC card that fits into a half slot on
IBM PCs and compatibles. It is based on the vendor's 6100 LAN chip, which
uses a proprietary technique called Differential Code Modulation to send
data at 100 Mbit/s over distances of up to about 330 feet and at 50 Mbit/s
nearly 650 feet using UTP. The 6100 LAN chip uses FDDI's standard framing
format, the vendor says.
    The T100A comes with two cable connectors, which means the adapters
can be set up in either star or bus configurations. According to PC Office,
the use of shielded twisted-pair wiring can effectively double connection
distances. With signal repeaters, distances over UTP can reach 2,500 feet,
the vendor claims. The adapter costs $595.

SNA, DEC, AND LAN TRAFFIC ON ONE BACKBONE
Netlink also plans to OEM its software to router vendors

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Good news for the guardians of billions of dollars' worth of IBM and DEC
gear: Netlink Inc. has announced three products that let traffic from SNA
and DEC devices share a backbone with PC LANs and Unix workstations using
IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, and AppleTalk protocols.
    Netlink's SDLC Link Server connects IBM gear such as the 3174 and
3274 communications controllers with 3745 front-end processors (FEPs)
across bridged LAN internetworks rather than leased telephone lines. The
Link Server not only simplifies network design but also costs less to
purchase and operate than comparable offerings from IBM.
    Another Netlink product, the Internetwork SNA Gateway, lets Digital
Equipment Corp. VT terminals emulate IBM 3270 terminals and links the VT
terminals to IBM hosts across the same backbone that carries SNA and LAN
traffic.
    Netlink also plans to resell its SNA software, which is based on
code used by Netlink products since 1988, to third-
party vendors--most likely router makers, which in turn will be able to
market routers that support SNA equipment. Sale of the software has
far-reaching potential, since it gives internetworking vendors lacking SNA
expertise a chance to purchase that expertise outright. If enough vendors
buy Netlink's software, the internetworking market could move away from its
current state of confusion toward greater interoperability and even a de
facto standard.
    The SDLC Link Server connects 3X74 controllers to 3745 FEPs by
converting the synchronous data link control (SDLC) data stream generated
by the controllers to the Logical Link Control 2 (LLC2) protocol sanctioned
by the IEEE for token ring LANs (see figure). The IBM method of linking
3174 controllers to remote FEPs across a LAN internetwork calls for users
to install a 3174 Token-Ring Interface Coupler (TIC) in the controller. The
TIC lets the controller communicate over a token ring LAN using LLC2. Other
IBM communications gear, such as bridges and gateways, also use LLC2. But
there's one big drawback: LLC2 is not a routable protocol, so routers used
in LANs cannot direct LLC2 traffic. Routers equipped with Netlink's SNA
software, however, will be able to direct traffic from SDLC Link Server.
    As noted, the IBM approach also costs more. A single 3174 TIC costs
$3,745, while an SDLC Link Server supporting two 3174s costs $6,490. The
savings grow as SDLC Link Servers are used to connect more 3174s. A 16-port
SDLC Link Server costs $23,000, while 16 IBM 3174 TICs would run $59,920.
Thus, the savings are greatest for sites with numerous 3174s. Moreover, a
connection to older 3274s or other IBM SDLC equipment, such as its banking
systems, isn't available from IBM--it doesn't make a TIC for them.
    As part of the conversion process, the SDLC Link Server adds
modified addresses and other information needed to make the data look to a
host as if it were coming from a 3174 equipped with a TIC.
    The SDLC Link Server's approach is very similar to that used in the
SNACS product line from Sync Research (Tustin, Calif.). Both convert an
SDLC data stream and make the third-party controller look like a 3174
equipped with a TIC. Another entrant in the SNA connectivity field, Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.), takes a different tack with its SNA
routing capability. Cisco allows SDLC to communicate over a LAN
internetwork, just as Netlink and Sync Research do. But Cisco's devices
don't perform the conversions needed to make an SDLC device look like any
other device. They simply transport SDLC through a router-based LAN
internetwork. To the 3745 FEP, the connected SDLC device still looks like a
3174 linked over aWAN rather than a LAN-attached device.
    The SNA software that Netlink will sell to other third-party
vendors offers yet another twist on this theme. As with Cisco routers
equipped with SNA routing--software that Cisco has promised--routers using
the Netlink code will able to form a LAN internetwork that products like
Netlink's SDLC Server Link and Sync Research's SNACS can then use. At
present, only bridges (or routers operating as bridges) can be used to
build such networks.
    Netlink's SNA software also adds capabilities not available through
IBM communications controllers, such as routing of data from 3174 and 3274
controllers to multiple hosts. In comparison, a 3174 with a TIC can send
data to a maximum of two hosts.
    Routers equipped with Netlink's SNA software also offer advantages
when connecting to Logical Unit 6.2 devices. The routers will accept data
from LU 6.2 devices in the same way a 3174 would, but with one improvement:
The FEPs will not have to provide instructions to the router. Another plus
is that multiple 3174s or other Physical Unit 2.0 devices attached to an
SDLC Link Server or router will appear to FEPs as one device supporting
many terminals. This PU 2.0 ''concentration'' function will reduce the
administrative tasks involved in maintaining an SNA network.
    Netlink says its routing software will support IBM's Advanced
Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN) Network Node scheme if and when IBM
publishes its specifications. Netlink says it supports only those SNA
routing capabilities with published specifications.
    The router software also will support NetView and the simple
network management protocol (SNMP). Router vendors will integrate the
network management capabilities and all the routing functions performed by
Netlink's software into their products by making available certain
Netlink-defined ''hooks.'' The Netlink software, acting as an integrated
part of the routers, will use these hooks to collect information from the
router, such as its knowledge of all available paths through an
internetwork.
    Netlink's Internetwork Gateway connects DEC VT100 terminals to IBM
hosts across a LAN internetwork. It also provides a direct gateway to IBM
hosts for these devices.
    In a typical application, the Internetwork Gateway would attach on
one side to an Ethernet LAN with a DEC or third-party terminal server. To
the DEC terminal server, the Internetwork Gateway appears to be a DEC host.
But rather than provide access to the host, the Internetwork Gateway
converts the Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol used by the DEC terminals
to the 3270 protocol used by IBM 3270 terminals. Like the SDLC Link Server,
the Internetwork Gateway then takes incoming data--in this case, 3270 data
from VT100 terminals--and converts it to the LLC2 protocol for transmission
across the LAN internetwork to a remote IBM 3745 FEP,.
    As a result, DEC terminal users can run 3270 sessions on their
existing DEC terminals, eliminating the need for users to have two
terminals on their desks.
    IBM does not support DEC's LAT protocol. Many third-party terminal
servers available for use with DEC terminals do provide 3270 gateways, but
none provide the LLC2 support of the Internetwork Gateway.
    The Internetwork Gateway supports between 16 and 128 LAT and 3270
terminal sessions, divided among any number of physical terminals. As with
Netlink's router software, NetView and SNMP are supported. The Internetwork
Gateway also supports DEC's Terminal Server Manager network management
software.

Product Summary
Products: SDLC Link Server Models 1, 2, and 3 and Internetwork Gateway. SNA
software for routers has no official name yet.

Description: SDLC Link Server connects SNA computers and communications
gear over LAN internetworks. Internetwork Gateway allows VT terminal users

SPEEDY LINKS FOR THE FAR-FLUNG

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Novell Inc. has enhanced its NetWare Link/64 and NetWare Link/T1 routers to
furnish 64-kbit/s and T1 (1.544-Mbit/s) connectivity among remote NetWare
networks via digital links or leased lines.
    The enhanced routers comprise software and specialized WAN
circuitry. New features include a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) driver that
allows Link/64 and Link/T1 routers to operate on a NetWare 3.1X platform;
support for larger frame sizes to increase data throughput; and support for
an X.21 interface adapter to meet international PTT requirements.
    Link/64 is suitable for electronic-mail, host access, network
management, and file transfer tasks. Large file transfers and database
applications will need the faster network connections Link/T1 can provide.

    The routers require an IBM PC/AT or 386 or compatible machine with
640 kbytes of RAM and NetWare 2.15 or later. Link/64 costs $1,495; Link/T1,
$3,995. Users of the earlier versions can upgrade for $625 and $1,500,
respectively.

MORE HOSTS FOR MACS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Walker Richer & Quinn Inc. has released the Telnet Connection for the
Macintosh, software that implements Telnet and the file transfer protocol
(FTP) over TCP/IP networks to give users access to data and applications on
Digital Equipment Corp. VAXes and Unix hosts.
    The Telnet Connection should be installed with the vendor's
Reflection 2 Plus for the Macintosh, a VT320 terminal emulator for

By:
Eric M. Hindin

OpenConnect Systems has released OpenConnect Server II Gateway, which
enables Sun Microsystems Inc. Sparcstations to interconnect IBM SNA and
TCP/IP networks. The gateway allows peer-to-peer communications links to be
established among IBM mainframes and midrange systems and Unix, VMS, and
DOS systems.
    Supported features include IP packet routing across an SNA backbone
and NetView control of TCP/IP nodes. Nodes on both networks can access and
pass data in either direction.
    The software also includes an Advanced Peer-to-Peer Computing
(APPC) library for Logical Unit (LU) 6.2 support on Unix workstations and
for 3287 printer support. The gateway supports all other OpenConnect

OVER COAX

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Tangram Systems Corp. has released Coax Max, a device driver for 3270
Distributed Function Terminal (DFT) coax adapters. Coax Max transfers data
at 1 to 3 Mbytes per minute, reducing communications time between DOS
workstations and the mainframe.
    Coax Max works with coax boards in DFT mode, which allows PCs to
send and receive data directly instead of writing to a 3270 screen. Coax
Max supports all IBM PC/XT/ATs, PS/2s, and compatible machines. It also
works with IBM 3278/3279 emulation adapters and compatibles capable of
supporting DFT. It costs $9,200 to $24,840, depending on CPU.

PRODUCT POTPOURRI FOR IBM MIDRANGE SYSTEMS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Andrew Corp. has announced a spate of products for IBM midrange systems,
including an active wiring hub, enhanced file transfer software, and a
Windows graphical user interface for 5250 terminal emulation.
    The SuperStar/400C wiring hub uses coax cabling to connect
twinaxial devices to AS/400 and System/3X hosts or controllers, providing
the benefits of a star-wired network. The hub lets users upgrade their
networks while retaining their original cable investment.
    The hub receives, amplifies, retimes, and splits signals into seven
device channels. All connected devices operate concurrently yet
independently, because each port has its own transmit and receive drivers.
A dual-port model supports up to 14 workstations. The single-port version
costs $695; the dual-port, $1,395.
    Andrew's ETU file transfer software for IBM S/38 and AS/400
computers now features record and field selection, multidevice transfers,
host-batch transfer execution, and entry/exit programs. Tasks that used to
require two or three separate commands now can be accomplished in one, the
vendor says. ETU 5.0 costs $800 for the S/38 and $950 for the AS/400. Users
of earlier versions can upgrade for $149 (S/38) and $249 (AS/400).
    Andrew also introduced TwinView, a Windows 3.0 graphical user
interface for the 3XTwin and Multi-Twin members of its Emerald Series of
5250 emulators. With the new interface, users can link PCs under Windows
3.0 to S/3X or AS/400 machines. TwinView users can operate up to seven
sessions at once, moving around with a mouse and scroll bars. Other
features include Windows Clipboard support, for copying and pasting text,
and Windows font support, for choosing fixed-pitch display fonts and font
sizes. TwinView also is compatible with ETU 5.0. It costs $149.

MULTITASKING FILE TRANSFER

By:
Eric M. Hindin

The Systems Center Inc. has added OS/2 software to its Network DataMover
series of automated data transfer products. Called Network DataMover-PC for
OS/2 (NDM-PC for OS/2), the product allows IBM PS/2s and other
OS/2-compatible machines to communicate automatically with IBM mainframe
hosts running under the MVS, VM, or VSE operating systems.
    The software uses the Communications Manager component of OS/2
Version 1.3 Extended Edition to set up a synchronous data link control
(SDLC) or token ring connection between the PC and the host. To set up this
connection, the user must have an IBM Multi-Protocol SDLC Adapter or
Token-Ring Adapter installed in the PC.
    NDM-PC for OS/2 performs binary and test file transfers using data
compression.
    Like other programs that take advantage of OS/2's multitasking
capabilities, NPM-PC for OS/2 runs concurrently with Communications Manager
3270 sessions and any other OS/2 sessions on the same machine. NPM-PC for
OS/2 also features a menu-driven user interface. It costs $850.

RUMBA TIME

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Wall Data Inc. has added several products to its Rumba line of PC-to-host
connectivity software, including 3270 emulation for TCP/IP networks and IBM
AS/400 minicomputers and OS/2, French-, and German-language versions of its
flagship software.
    The Rumba TN3270 interface allows PC users on TCP/IP networks to
connect to IBM mainframes through the Microsoft Windows graphical user
interface. It works with mainframe-based TCP/IP Telnet servers to deliver
3270 terminal emulation to PC users. Users can access, use, and integrate
data simultaneously from multiple hosts. TN3270 features include support
for IBM Models 2 through 5 terminals, full mapping of 3270 function keys,
multiple sessions, mainframe graphics, and IND$FILE data transfer. The
interface is included with Rumba Version 3.1, which costs $495.
    The Rumba for 3270 feature is an option for users of Rumba for
AS/400. Users see the familiar Rumba interface, but now they can access
3270 mainframe information and integrate it into their AS/400 and PC
applications. With a few mouse clicks, users can cut and paste information
between 3270 sessions and Windows or AS/400 applications, quickly
assembling elements from disparate host sources. The option costs $200.
    Rumba PM 1.0 allows users of OS/2 with Presentation Manager to
access 3270 host applications. Previously, Rumba was available only under
Microsoft Windows. Rumba PM features include QuickStep, which automates
host access; Hotlinks, which brings in host data to OS/2 applications; and
Hotspots, which activates common host functions. Users also can customize
the keyboard and display colors. Rumba PM costs $495.
    Finally, for international and multinational users, the vendor has
released French- and German-language versions of its flagship product,
Rumba 3.1. Context-sensitive help is provided in both languages. The French
and German versions are available from Wall Data and its distributors in
France and Germany. The packages cost $495 each if purchased in the United
States.

RJE EMULATOR FOR OS/2 AND DOS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Network Software Associates Inc. has unveiled an 802.2 link driver for its
AdaptSNA RJE PC-to-host communications software package. This makes
AdaptSNA RJE the first RJE emulator for OS/2 PCs to support Logical Link
Control (LLC) environments, the vendor says.
    Remote job entry (RJE) is used by many companies for the efficient
transfer of large amounts of data. RJE under OS/2 is significant because
OS/2 Extended Edition, while providing 3270 and Advanced Program-to-Program
Communications (APPC) and Logical Unit (LU) 6.2 links, ignores RJE.
AdaptSNA RJE can be used for batch transfer applications in IBM Job Entry
Subsystem (JES), Power, or other Virtual Telecommunications Access Method
(VTAM) environments.
    AdaptSNA RJE ($785) is available for both OS/2 and DOS. OS/2 users
can initiate an RJE file transfer and run other applications
simultaneously. AdaptSNA RJE also can be used in unattended operations,
automatically loading when the workstation is turned on and simply waiting
until the host is ready to download.

CONFIGURE ROUTERS ON MULTIPLE SNMP SYSTEMS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Wellfleet Communications Inc. has introduced a Network Configuration
Utility (NCU) that allows users to configure networks of many Wellfleet
routers from a central workstation. The NCU software works with any simple
network management protocol (SNMP)-based management system running on a Sun
workstation, the vendor says.
    NCU offers a menu-driven interface for setting up new router nodes
and automatically constructs and maintains a Structured Query Language
(SQL) database of information on the network.
    Wellfleet says NCU is simple enough for novice operators to use.
Configuration changes to a network of routers are made from a Unix-based
windowing interface via pop-up menus that prompt the user to define a node
and bring it on-line. For example, to configure an IP router, Wellfleet
says, a user need only enter the IP address, subnet mask, and transmit
broadcast type; NCU automatically supplies the rest of the information
needed to get the router up and running. The product also comes with an
expert editor that allows more technically astute net managers to adjust
parameters and optimize network performance.
    NCU is the first product in Wellfleet's Advanced Internetwork
Management (AIM) program, under which the vendor plans to provide
applications for managing Wellfleet routers on a range of SNMP platform
systems. In the future, the vendor says, AIM value-added SNMP applications
will incorporate various SNMP management information bases (MIBs) for
managing Wellfleet equipment, such as the Remote Monitoring MIB, which
Wellfleet says will offer more comprehensive fault and performance
information than is possible with SNMP MIB II. NCU prices begin at $5,000,
including the SQL database.

NETWORK MONITORING BY PROXY

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Kalpana Inc. has added simple network management protocol (SNMP) support to
its EtherSwitch fast packet Ethernet switches. Network managers now can
remotely monitor and control multiple EtherSwitches from a single SNMP
station.
    EtherSwitch SNMP Proxy Agent combines an SNMP management
information base II (MIB II) agent and an MIB extension that works with
third-party SNMP management systems to generate alarms, collect statistics,
and perform diagnostics. The proxy agent can monitor the traffic load of
each EtherSwitch port, producing reports on both local and remote traffic
loads.
    The EtherSwitch SNMP Proxy Agent runs as a background task on Sun
Sparcstations or servers and can be located on the same platform as the
management station software. EtherSwitch products shipped after July 1,
1991, include the Proxy Agent as a no-cost option. Upgrade kits for units
shipped before then cost $150.

STRONG-ARMING SECURITY BREACHES

By:
Eric M. Hindin

SunSoft has added two packages to its SunShield line of security products:
Account Resource Management (ARM) and Automated Security Enhanced Tool
(ASET). The packages let users customize security for Unix networks.
    With ARM, administrators can specify parameters for functions such
as password length and the number of attempts permitted for gaining access
to a network. They can limit log-on attempts for all or part of the
network, as well as individual systems. ARM also lets network managers
restrict access hours, lock screens, and set automatic expiration limits on
passwords and user accounts.
    ASET lets administrators adjust security levels, automatically
modifying the system to the desired levels. With ASET, network managers can
build a ''fire wall'' between a company's internal network and external
networks.
    ARM and ASET together cost $295 for a single license and $4,500 for
a site license. Additional documentation costs $100 per copy.

'FRAME SERVER' DISHES UP MORE FRAME RELAY FLAVORS
Timeplex's device comes in add-in and standalone versions and offers a
choice of connection types

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Plenty of mux vendors have caught the frame relay bug, but only Timeplex
Inc. offers an interface both as an enhancement to existing muxes and as a
standalone unit. That gives users of the vendor's Link/FrameServer more
choices for connecting FDDI, token ring, and Ethernet LANs--including the
ability to pass SNA traffic across a frame relay link.
    Frame relay is becoming a popular choice for LAN interconnect
because of its low overhead and high data rates (up to 1.544 Mbit/s at
present). By adding a card to Timeplex's Link/2+ multiplexer, network
managers can squeeze more traffic onto available bandwidth.
    Because the frame server also is available in standalone form, a
typical configuration might include sites both with and without Link/2+
muxes (see figure). Sites with muxes most likely will use them to transport
a mix of voice and data, while those without probably will use bridges or
routers to transport LAN data, says James Babcock, Timeplex's vice
president for product management.
    At those sites with a mux, the frame server would permit LAN data
to be carried across the backbone in frame relay form, along with
circuit-switched voice. Regardless of the presence or absence of a mux,
LANs connect to the frame server either directly or through a router.
    The frame relay network can be either a private network (i.e., a
mux-based backbone) or a public frame relay service. To transport data over
the wide area, the frame server encapsulates each data packet in a link
access procedure-D (LAPD) frame, adding a flag and data link circuit
identifier (DLCI) with addressing information at the beginning of each
frame and a frame check sequence at the end. The frame server then filters
the frames based on their DLCIs and sends them to the appropriate wide-area
connections.
    Network managers can transport SNA traffic across frame relay nets
thanks to the frame server's encapsulation of high-level/synchronous data
link control (HDLC/SDLC) frames. The encapsulated SDLC or HDLC frames are
sent across the network in either point-to-point or multipoint mode using
idle suppression (a process that prevents idle SDLC frames from being sent
across the network) for improved bandwidth utilization.
    Timeplex's encapsulation approach differs from that proposed by
many router vendors, according to Jim Harrison, program director for global
network strategies at the Meta Group Inc. (Westport, Conn.), a market
research firm. Harrison says router makers may add SDLC-over-frame
relay support by encapsulating SDLC frames twice--first within TCP/IP
packets, and second within LAP-D frames.
    There are two advantages to dual encapsulation, Harrison says.
First, it allows SDLC packets to be carried not only across the wide area
but also across LAN backbones at remote sites. Second, network managers
have better control over the integrity and routing of SDLC data if it's
encapsulated within a higher-level protocol like TCP/IP.
    However, dual encapsulation is more complex, and in Harrison's view
it's ultimately a stopgap measure. Most industry observers believe frame
relay eventually will include specs for higher-level protocols that would
ensure end-to-end data integrity.
    In addition to SDLC, the frame server also can handle traffic from
Ethernet, token ring, and fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) LANs. The
combination of LANs and WANs it connects to, and how it connects to them,
depends on choice of configuration.
    The unit features a high-speed (550-Mbit/s) bus with a control
board and three slots for add-in cards that supply various connections.
These links can include four T1/E1 lines, up to four Ethernets, two token
rings, and one dual-attached FDDI connection. Any combination of cards can
be installed in the frame server; for example, network managers can choose
to install wide-area cards in all three of the device's slots for a total
of 12 WAN connections. LANs also can connect, via routers, across a T1 link
to the frame server.
    The frame server's modular design means network managers can employ
it in a variety of settings, ranging from switching to routing. In the
12-port WAN configuration, for instance, the frame server acts as a frame
relay switch, accepting frames at a port, filtering them based on the
DLCIs, and forwarding them out one of the other ports. If the unit is
stocked solely with LAN cards, it acts as a multiprotocol router for
TCP/IP, Xerox Network Services (XNS), and Internet Packet Exchange (IPX)
traffic. In this case, LAN data packets are routed based on their TCP/IP,
XNS, or IPX addresses.
    But these two configurations--pure switch and pure router--are
unlikely to be widely employed; users more likely will want some
combination of routing and frame switching. Timeplex's Babcock says
several companies have asked to use the product on a trial basis when it
becomes available for beta testing early next year. One user wants to
install frame server cards in its Link/2+ multiplexers to add support for
frame relay to its time-division multiplexing (TDM) backbone. That company
now uses the backbone for voice and video and wants to add LAN traffic.
Another company has a router-based network to which it wants to add a
frame relay backbone.
    Most multiplexer vendors have been developing some form of frame
relay packet switch for their TDM multiplexers. Timeplex's scheme of
dividing the backbone between packet and circuit data (when the frame
server is installed inside the Link/2+ mux rather than as a standalone unit
connected to a pure frame relay backbone) is a relatively common method
called ''packet over circuit.''
    The essential feature in packet-over-circuit techniques is that the
mux-and-frame server combination uses separate components to process
packets and frames. There are other approaches to combining frame and
circuit technology; StrataCom, for example, creates virtual circuits over a
packet-switched architecture.
    Meta Group's Harrison describes the Timeplex approach as similar to
that of Network Equipment Technologies Inc. (Redwood City, Calif.) and
Newbridge Networks Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.). ''It's the right move for
Timeplex,'' he says of the frame server. He believes, however, the product
will appeal mostly to network managers who are already Timeplex customers.

ECHO CANCELER ALSO MONITORS PERFORMANCE

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Micro Integrated Communications Corp. says its EC1000 is the first digital
echo canceler that monitors circuit performance. The device, which can be
used by common carriers and managers of private T1 networks, enables users
to control both functions from a single built-in keypad. The EC1000
monitors performance of extended superframe (ESF) format traffic, according
to the vendor.
    Each EC1000 can monitor up to 16 T1 circuits. Operators are alerted
to circuit problems via audible alarms and warning lights that flash on the
unit's liquid crystal display. To cancel line echo, the unit has a residual
echo control that replaces any echo encountered with matched background
noise. The EC1000 also has a dual power supply configured for load sharing.
If one supply fails, the other can maintain adequate power for the unit,
the vendor says. The EC1000 costs $100 per channel.

OS-INDEPENDENT FAX AND VOICE API

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Brooktrout Technology Inc. has announced an application program interface
(API) for its TR series of single- and multiple-channel facsimile- and
voice-line cards. The C-language tool kit helps programmers generate
multiple-channel fax and voice applications for the TR cards. The API
provides a link between Brooktrout's hardware drivers and application
software and includes the T.30 facsimile protocol supported on the
Brooktrout card, so programmers need not study each card's command set or
protocols to develop software.
    The PC/AT-compatible cards, which support combined voice and fax
applications with a single chip, operate under DOS and Unix.
    The API will work with any operating system, trimming development
time, according to Brooktrout. Comprising programming functionsthat combine
ASCII and Group 3 fax data into one structure, the API supports all
Brooktrout voice/fax cards, which cost $2,495 each. The API costs $300.

JUST THE FAX FOR AS/400S

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Quadrant Software has announced FastFax/Plus for the AS/400, a hardware/
software product for both interactive and batch environments. AS/400 users
can send faxes directly from their terminals without leaving their
applications, while the MIS department can batch faxes for off-hour
delivery using a single command.
    End-users can scan in their own signatures, logos, forms, and
graphics. FastFax/Plus can capture multiple screens and send them in a
single transmission. The product automatically generates custom-designed
cover pages, and it can transmit files created on PCs, such as text and
spreadsheets from WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, and Lotus 1-2-3.
    MIS staff also can add fax capability to interactive applications
with minimal programming and set up AS/400 output queues using FastFax/Plus
options. Another option allows FastFax/Plus to receive plain-paper faxes
and print them on attached HP LaserJet or Canon LBP-8 laser printers.
    The FastFax/Plus includes documentation for both system
administrators and end-users. It costs from $4,995 to $6,495, depending on
the AS/400 model.

MODEM BOOSTS ERROR CORRECTION

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Microcom Inc.'s QX/4232bis high-speed modem complies with the company's
Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) Class 10 standard to provide virtually
error-free PC communications on dial-up or leased lines, the vendor claims.
The modem also provides CCITT V.32bis transmission at up to 14.4 kbit/s and
effective throughput rates of up to 38.4 kbit/s using V.42bis data
compression, the vendor says.
    MNP 10 maintains data integrity by decreasing transmission rates
when line quality degrades. When interference decreases, the modem
increases transmission speed to its maximum throughput.
    Other features that improve transmission speed include changing
packet sizes to compensate for varying interference levels and beginning
link setup at the most stable line speed. The QX/4232bis costs $999.

FROM OLD MODEMS TO NEW

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Release 3.0 of Octocom Systems Inc.'s 8X96 line of 14.4-kbit/s modems can
automatically answer either full- or half-duplex calls. The use of a
half-duplex autodetect mode allows users to phase in the faster devices as
they upgrade from older modems, such as half-duplex 4.8-kbit/s modems. For
instance, modems at central sites can be replaced first, and those at
remote locations can be phased in over a period of time.
    The 8X96 modem works with dial-up or leased lines and connects to a
wide variety of front-end processors, according to the vendor. The modems
support all Bell and CCITT modem standards, including the V.42bis standard
for data compression. In addition, the modems are fully compatible with
Octocom's network management system. Prices for the 8X96 line start at
$1,195.
