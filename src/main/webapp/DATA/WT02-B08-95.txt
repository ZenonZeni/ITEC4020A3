<H1>NEW HOPE FOR TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
AT LEAST eight new drugs -- out of a total of 80 now in the pipeline --
would become available for the treatment of schizophrenia in the next decade,
a Melbourne psychiatrist, Dr David Copolov, said today.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Copolov, director of the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria,
is attending the World Congress of CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum)
in Melbourne.<BR>
<BR>
Schizophrenia, which affects one per cent of the population, is one of the
most common mental disorders.<BR>
<BR>
Until recently it had been possible to test only a few chemical compounds
in a month, Dr Copolov said. New screening techniques now made possible
to test tens of thousands. <BR>
<BR>
Drugs were being developed that had the same efficacy as current drugs in
treating schizophrenia, but had fewer side effects, especially those causing
stiffness and tremor, and -- perhaps the most distressing -- inner restlessness.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Copolov said: &quot;The big question is: Will the new drugs have very
useful effects on treatment-resistant people (about a third of patients)?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That will be determined only after very extensive studies, and so
it's too early to say whether they will have superior efficacy. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Drugs must always be harnessed with psycho-social treatments, because
these treatments help people with the skills of daily living and inter-personal
relationships.&quot; <BR>
