<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">EVANSDALE &#151; As a fibromyalgia sufferer, I
was compelled to respond to the arrest of Allen Helmers for the
use of marijuana for medical reasons.&nbsp; Researchers
haven&#146;t been able to find a cause or cure.&nbsp; The
government needs to grant more money for research.&nbsp; I
currently take several pills a day which are not helping the pain
and suffering.&nbsp; I don&#146;t like taking all this medication
with varying side effects.&nbsp; The results of all these
medications can be life threatening.&nbsp; I struggle with the grief
over the loss of physical and mental abilities that I used to
take for granted.&nbsp; I am very frustrated with the limitations
this syndrome causes in my life.&nbsp; I am never free of pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Many doctors need to be thoroughly educated on the reality of
what fibromyalgia is.&nbsp; It is founded that the medical use of
marijuana has been very effective in relieving discomfort and
pain for many who suffer from other illnesses also (cancer, AIDS,
epilepsy, etc.).&nbsp; Our medical communities need to be well
informed so they can understand the need we have for a substance that
can alleviate pain for so many and possibly give them back some
quality of life.&nbsp; Laws must be passed to enable our medical
community to have the right to prescribe any drug or substance
that will open a new avenue of relief for those who suffer from
chronic pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">The use of marijuana would indeed have a significant reduction in
the amount of non-beneficial prescription drugs with harmful side
effects.&nbsp; Marijuana cannot be any worse that the medications we
are prescribed.&nbsp; Why is it not available to the medical
community?</p>
