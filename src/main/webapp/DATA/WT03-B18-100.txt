<P>FDA SWAT TEAM SEIZES GASTON NAESSENS INFORMATION</P>

<P>Denial of the freedom of thought and speech has apparently become an
element of the FDA's drive to regulate medicine in the U.S.A. In July,
and FDA SWAT team invaded teh New York offices of a publishing company
to seize information concerning the use of an unapproved material as a
cancer treatment.</P>

<P>Materials seized from Writers and Research, Inc. of Rochester, NY, included
books and booklets on a controversial camphor-based treatment for cancer
called 714X, developed by Gaston Naessens. Also seized was computer equipment,
a seizure justified by an agent because it was &quot;used to print information
on a substance that is banned in the US&quot;. The drug itself was not
the target of the raid-only information about it, as well as files of people
who had expressed interest in it.</P>

<P>Writers and Research had contacted the FDA in the process of obtaining
approval to import 714X into the United States. Towards this end, the company
had constituted an Institutional Review Board to examine the claims made
for 714X, a step necessary to gaining FDA approval. This had been done
two months prior to the FDA raid. The FDA had not disqualified this board,
but had prohibited any reference to its findings before approval.</P>

<P>In Short, the FDA raided a company prior to that company achieving its
stated desire of gaining approval for an alternative medicine. They did
not raid to seize medicine. They raided to stop dissemination of information
about that medicine.</P>

<P>BIG BROTHER &amp; CLINTON'S HEALTH SECURITY ACT</P>

<P>Clinton's health care plan ensures that everyone has access to medical
care- and ravages the Bill of Rights in the process. If one reads the 1342
page Health Security Act, as Jarret Wollstein did, one wonders what Machiavellian
mind devised it. Jarret WOllstein, Director of the International Society
for Individual Liberty and co-author of Lethal Compassion: WHy National
Health Care is the Cure that Kills, explained in an interview published
by The Financial Privacy Report (May 1994) how Clinton's health care bill
affects freedom of choice and medical privacy.</P>

<P>FIrst, Clinton's plan states that everyone &quot;must enroll&quot; in
a government-run health alliance and &quot;must pay any premium required&quot;.
The health premium is actually a payroll tax of 7.6% of the pay cheque,
which is about equal to the amount removed from employees' cheques for
Social Security. Imagine trying to survive on a minimum wage with another
7.6% taken out. Where is the incentive to work if the pay cheque at the
end of the month can't begin to pay for food and housing? The amount of
this &quot;premium&quot; is set by the local health alliance and a politically
appointed National Health Board at their discretion. No ceiling amound
has been set. Self-employed people who refuse to pay or can't afford to
pay are fined three times the amount of premium, or US$5,000, whichever
is higher. If they don't pay, the government has the right to seize their
assets. In other words, we hav eno choice but to pay for this plan, whether
we want it or not. We don't even get to vote on it.</P>

<P>But all of us will get the health care we want or need under this plan,
right? Wrong. As Wollstein points out, approximately 37 million more people
will have access to clinics and doctors. To regulate the increased flow,
government &quot;gatekeepers&quot; no patients, not doctors-willdecide
who gets in to see a doctor or into a hospital. Anyone who tries to bypass
the health plan and use his or her own money to pay for covered medical
services faces 15 years imprisonment and fines up to US$50,000-that is,
if you can find a doctor willing to risk the same penalties.</P>

<P>Under the Health Security Act, the Department of Justice also has the
right to confiscate anything you own if you are accused, not necessarily
convicted, of threatening the health of anyone or having a &quot;significant
detrimental impact on the health care system&quot;. Curiously, no monies
have been budgeted to fund this new policing bureau. In its own self-interest,
the bureau will have to be zealous in its confiscation of property.</P>

<P>Finally, Clinton's Health Security Bill forbids doctors from withholding
information about their patients from the government; medical privacy will
no longer be honored. Doctors can be fined up to US$10,000 per violation,
without trial. This information, according to the health act, can be used
for any &quot;lawful purpose&quot;, and the National Health Board is authorized
to get other information about individuals from any other government agency,
including the ISR. Why does a health board need such powers?</P>

<P>The abridgement of freedom and righst in this Health Security Act is
too high a price to pay for universal health care. Congress apparently
agrees. Senate Bill 1227 exempts members of Congress and all federal employees
from any national health care plan. If they don't want it, why should we?</P>

<P>WILL MOBILE PHONES BECOME MOBILE ID TAGS?</P>

<P>Not many people realise that the technology exists to track a person's
whereabouts from their mobile phone handset via certain types of satellites.</P>

<P>The next step in our technological 'evolution' from the consumer's point
of view is that virtually everyone will have their own personal mobile
phone, with their own personal mobile phone ID number. Each of these mobile
phone handsets emits a virtually continous signal which is picked up by
satellite or ground tower and relayed on. It is rumoured that most handsets
emit this signal even when the power is turned off. It is any Big Brother's
dream come true in terms of knowing where everyone is at any time.</P>

<P>It was announced in UK newspapers recently that by 1988, mobile phones
will go global. Your handset will give you access to a satellite based
system that will allow calls to be made pracctically anywhere on Earth.</P>

<P>&quot;Iridium, a consortium of 17 major companies led by Motorola, proposes
to launch 66 satellites in orbits corssing both poles, ensuring a satellite
will fly over every spot on Earth at least once every nine minutes. Any
any one time at least three satellites will be in view, enabling the handset's
precise position to be located.&quot;</P>

<P>CANADIAN NEO-NAZI GROUP CREATED BY BRITAIN'S MI5?</P>

<P>Canada's government-appointed intelligence watchdog group is investigating
allegations that the Canadian Secret Intelligence Service (CSIS), the counterpart
of Britain's MI5, founded and steered Canada's main neo-Nazi organization,
Heritage Front.</P>

<P>These allegations are also made in a book, titled The Ugly Truth about
the ADL, which uncovers most neo-Nazi provocateurs as a completely controlled
international product of British intelligence operations in North America
and elsewhere, with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) playing a special
starring role.</P>

<P>According to the Toronto Sun, one Grant Bristow organised the Heritage
Front whiilst in receipt of $50,000 per year from the CSIS, and then &quot;threw
himself into running a small unit of the front that specialised in dirty-tricks
campaigns against anti-racists&quot; by infiltrating such groups and setting
them up against each other.</P>

<P>The tactics of creating an imaginary enemy to justify funding are not
rare. Take the recent case of US mayoral hopeful, Donald Mintz. He produced
and distrubited disgusting anti-Jewish leaflets and then appealed to the
Jewish community for campaign funds to fight the racists. In this case
a local reporter caught him in the act and dashed all hopes of being elected.</P>

<P>OXYGEN THERAPIES UNDER ATTACK IN THE UK</P>

<P>In Australia they're called the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration);
in America they're called the FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration); and
in the UK they're called the MCA (Medicines Control Agency). But no matter
where they are or what they are called, they all have an agenda to restrict
public access to &quot;unauthorised&quot; health care treatments.</P>

<P>The British medical bureaucracy, like its counterpart in Australia and
the US has decided that the increasing number of success stories emerging
from the use of oxygen therapies has to stop.</P>

<P>In June of last year the Ministry of Health 'visited' the offices of
Echo UK, a non-profit oxygen therapies information centre involved only
in the dissemination of public domain literature. They had a warrant signed
by no less than the Minister of Health, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, giving
them authority to inspect all files and literature. Echo UK was informed
(incorrectly) that they were breaking the law by distributing some of the
information in their possession.</P>

<P>Pressure from the MCA and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain was also applied to Echo UK, all in an attempt to stop them from
distributing already publicly available information.</P>

<P>I suppose, though, the British should consider themselves lucky. I mean,
they only get polite gentlemen bearing a warrant to inspect files and literature,
while in the USA they send in an armed SWAT team with fully-loaded automatic
weapons and wearing flak jackets, who kick the door down, steal everything
and then trash the place while holding staff and patients at gunpoint against
the wall.</P>

<P>COLD WAR CON?</P>

<P>When presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush signed an agreement
in 1991 to take all Soviet and US nuclear bombers off alert and put the
warheads into storage, it was celebrated as a breakthrough.</P>

<P>But according to an item in the London Sunday Times, the two presidents
were merely formalising a secret 'arrangement' that had existed for decades.</P>

<P>The truth emerged when the deputy head of Russia's Strategic Air Force,
Major General Anatoli Solovyov, revealed that for safety reasons, &quot;we
never flew within nuclear weapons, inly with imitations&quot;.</P>

<P>Similarly, the US Strategic Bomber Fleet was largely grounded after
a couple of accidents in the 1960s. (Four nuclear weapons fell from a B-52
bomber off Palomares, Spain, in 1966; and in 1968, a B-52 crashed near
the Thule Air Force Base in Greenland with four nuclear bombs on board.)
After 1967, all the bombers in the US Strategic Fleet were grounded until
the end of the Cold War.</P>

<P>UN TREATIES - NEW WORLD ORDER BY STEALTH?</P>

<P>Australians are beginning to wake up to the fact that the Federal Government
has been very busy making Australia a co-signatory to literally thousands
of international treaties. United Nations treates, with irresistible names
such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),
are usually signed without as much as a whisper to the public for debate.</P>

<P>When Governor-General Bill Hayden signed the abovementioned ICCPR on
25th December 1991, he hadn't counted on the public uproar that would ensue.
Tens of thousands of people phoned and wrote to politicians complaining
that the bill was a defacto Bill of Rights being imposed upon all Australians
by an unelected faceless UN committee in another country.</P>

<P>The following December, the Governor General was asked to ratify a treaty
(ILO158) only hours before the dissolution of Parliament. No media release
was issued. There was no public debate.</P>

<P>The latest example of the effects of UN treateis upon Australian citizens'
rights is of course the homosexual rights issue in Tasmania. Here we have
an island state in a democracy where many of the people seem to want the
law to stay the way it is. However, it says in one of the several thousand
treaties we have signed that this law is not acceptable. It is a pity that
the Federal Government did not tell the people of Tasmania this when they
signed the treaty in the first place-or was that the general idea?</P>

<P>The following extract is worth reading in light of the above: 'The remarkable
growth of international laws had led countries including Australia to surrender
parts of their sovereignty to the world community, the former Governor-General
of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen, said last night.</P>

<P>Sir Ninian, chairman of the foundation examining Australia's Constitution,
said that international justice and peace would only come by adherence
to such laws, of which there are now over 50,000.</P>

<P>His views, expressed at the opening of the International Bar Association
converence in Melbourne, echoed those of former Prime Minister, Mr Goug
Whitlam.</P>

<P>Mr Whitlam said recently that it was crucial for Canberra to introduce
world standards such as United Nations and International Labour Organisation
and not be deterred by State's rights.</P>

<P>The 50,000 new international instuments, treaties and conventions formed
over the past few decades are administered by more than 2,000 new international
agencies and instrmentalities, said Sir Ninian.</P>

<P>&quot;The result has been in every country a plethora of new laws appearing
on the statute book, giving local effect ot newly assumed international
obligations,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>Countries have voluntarily surrendered parts of their sovereignty in
the cause of interdependence and cooperation.</P>

<P>&quot;It will surely only be by the extension of international law throughout
the nations and its universal observance that they (countries) will come
to live together at peace and in justice as one world communitiy.&quot;</P>

<P>NEW WORLD ORDER in the U.S.A.</P>

<P>Written By The P/\NTHER -UMF/TRSi-</P>

<P>This country is just one step away from total disarmament and a One-World
police-controlled Economic Government!</P>

<P>The Civil War, WW I, WW II, the Korean Conflict, VietNam, Desert Storm,
the Randy Weaver incident, the Waco situation, Somalia, Bosnia, etc. were
purposely imposed on the peoples of the world to condition them to be controlled
by a few self-appointed rulers.</P>

<P>In 1913, the U.S. Congress relinquished its responsibility regarding
our money system by allowing the &quot;private&quot; Federal Reserve System
to be established and controlled by the Illuminati (the hidden government
consisting of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission
and the Bilderbergers, which are headed up by the Rockefellers in the United
States and by the Rothschilds of Europe) and its &quot;stockholders.&quot;
(Trilateralism is international economic regionalism dealing with INTERdependence,
and not a final goal. It is a precursor to the one-world government being
planned for humanity by the international cartelists vain enough to think
they are destined to rule over a slave humanity, despite the wishes and
rights of mankind.)</P>

<P>Also, in 1913, the Congress allowed the Internal Revenue Service (Title
26) to operate under the &quot;color of law.&quot; Title 26 has never been
enacted into law by Congress.</P>

<P>In 1921, the CFR saw its birth, to be joined soon thereafter by the
TC - both Rockefeller institutions and headquartered in New York as is
the United Nations.</P>

<P>In 1945, the United States, through constant promoting from the U.S.
State Department, signed the United Nations Charter, overriding our U.S.
Constitution and Bill of Rights.</P>

<P>In 1961, the former President Nixon signed Executive Order 11647 (precursor
towards acceptance of NAFTA a Treaty). This E.O. divided the U.S. into
ten federal regions to be run by &quot;Federal Regional Councils&quot;
(over 18 states have since rejected Regionalism, but who is listening?).
(School children are being groomed to accept Regional Government - look
at the back of the small KIX Cereal box at your local grocery stores.)</P>

<P>The lines drawn for these federal regions cross State lines, thus obliterating
the sovereignty of the States. Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution
declares:</P>

<P>&quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union
a republican form of government...&quot;</P>

<P>A republican form of government is defined in Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary as one in which &quot;the sovereign power resides in a certain
body of the people--the electorate--and is exercised by representatives
elected by, and responsible to, them.&quot;</P>

<P>Under the Federal Regional Councils proclaimed by President Nixon, government
in the ten federal regions would be administered by federal-appointed bureaucrats
accountable only to Washington, D.C. Nixon's actions are a clear violation
of the U.S. Constitution, Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1, which stipulates:</P>

<P>&quot;New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but
no new STate shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
other State, nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more States,
or parts of States, without the consent of the Legislatures of the States
concerned as well as of the Congress.&quot;</P>

<P>Nixon did not obtain the consent of all the State Legislatures concerned,
nor of Congress. At the time of signing E.O. 11647, Nixon included the
Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). The LEAA is becoming
increasingly involved in dishing out taxpayers' dollars to finance programs
of merger, consolidation and regionalization of local police forces. (When
a national police force becomes a recognized, accepted, operating reality,
it will no longer be ineffective and permissive; it will be ruthlessly
efficient and repressive.)</P>

<P>Establishment of LEAA is a crucial first step to a national police force.
President Clinton recently announced he is making $22 billion available
to upgrade all states' police forces (with a few more prisons thrown in
for good measure); there are strings attached to it - any time the federal
government has an input, it controls.</P>

<P>The &quot;hidden&quot; government (CFR/TC/Bilderbergers, etc) to which
nearly all State Department officials belong, as well as many other appointed
and elected positions of our government (to include Congressmen and Senators),
is using the Communist technique of discrediting the local police in the
eyes of the people. A national police force with unlimited powers is one
of the most important characteristics of a totalitarian dictatorship. The
plot against local control of the police has been in the making for some
time. A national police force would take from the States the responsibility
of enforcing laws that should remain in their jurisdiction. Law-abiding
citizens and local officials should vigorously oppose concerted attacks
against local law enforcement and the devious moves to negate local authority
and replace it with federal police power. There are many SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL
POLICE COMMITTEES operating throughout the country. With the passing of
the Brady Gun Bill, another step towards total disarmament and elimination
of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
If the American people permit a national police force to be established,
no citizen will be permitted to have a gun in his possession to defend
himself and his family against this planned tyranny. The Brady Gun Bill
becomes &quot;law&quot; 90 days after its signing - so come March 1994,
or even before, more stringent gun control bills will either be signed
into law or on the drawing board. Those communities know to encourage at
least one gun ownership per household have far less crime. Statistics prove
gun control increases crime - criminals become more arrogant, they know
our present justice system is &quot;soft&quot; on them; it is the law-abiding
citizen who is prosecuted/persecuted.</P>

<P>In between all the above actions to dissolve America, the presidents
have instituted Executive Orders which give one man, the president, total
control over all our lives in these United States of America!</P>

<P>In 1984, former President Reagan conditionally agreed to Total Disarmament
of the United States of America which would automatically include Total
Gun Confiscation - private citizens especially !</P>

<P>In 1989, 400 Congressmen signed into law P.L. 101-216, which reinforces
P.L. 87-297 and State Department Document #7277. (Approximately 33 California
Congressmen signed this P.L. - those still holding public office include:
Paneta, Boxer, Dellums, Beilenson, Berman, Dornan, Dreier, Thomas, Fazio,
Lantos, Lehman, Matsui, McCandless, Mineta, Moorhead, Packard, Pelosi,
J. Lewis, Stark, Rohrabacher, Torres, Waxman and others - and former Cong.
Dannemeyer who hopes to unseat Senator Feinstein in 1994.)</P>

<P>In 1994 the Crime Control Act was passed (which will further remove
many of our freedoms and inalienable rights under the U.S. Constitution
and Bill of Rights), the National Health Care Act (Socialized Medicine,
which will impose additional restrictions on the people), Goals 200 (total
control of our children, through Federal Government schools), etc. All
of these &quot;programs&quot; will impose additional taxes on the general
public.</P>

<P>The National Education Association (NEA) is listed as a participating
organization in the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. The NEA's chief
commitment is to promote a planned society which will train children to
disregard the traditional values of their parents, preparing them to adjust
to, and support, growing collectivism. The NEA is a tax-exempt organization
-- meaning that you help pay for its programs, to include your own disarmament.</P>

<P>Emerging throughout our nation is the Fully Informed Jury ASsociation
whose doctrine is to insure &quot;fully informed jurists&quot; in our court
rooms 0 many judges prohibit proper indoctrination of juries.</P>

<P>Every step the U.S. takes toward political and economic entanglements
with the rest of the world is a step toward realization of the end object
of the CFR, the TC, the Bilderbergers, etc., which is to create a one-world
socialist, political and economic system in which we (the U.S.) will be
one of the subjugated provinces. So, now we have the illegally passed NAFTA;
read Article II, Sec. 2, Para. 2 of the U.S. Constitution.</P>

<P>World government would seriously impair if not totally destroy the national
sovereignty of the United States of America. Loss of a national sovereignty
means not only the loss of the power to control the destiny of a nation,
it also means the loss of the rights of the individual citizens in that
nation. One of the direct links between the CFR and the &quot;big business&quot;
community is the Committee for Economic Development (CED). The CFR is geared
to control our foreign policy (which it has been doing since its inception
in 1921, regardless of what party represents the White House); the CED
concerns itself with domestic policy of this country. It is the #1 priority
of the CFR and CED to nullify the power of the individual States, leaving
them at the mercy of the all-powerful federal government, a government
controlled by men belonging to the CFR and the CED (as well as the Trilateral
Commission and the Bilderberger Group).</P>

<P>The Rockefellers have been working for five decades to control the American
government so they can dominate our economy...</P>

<P>The Rockefeller game plan is to consolidate control over the world's
economies by merging all the nations of the world under a single Rockefeller/Rothschild-controlled
tent. Such a government would have to be a dictatorship, ruled by Rockefeller
and Rothschild puppets or by the Communist-Third World bloc. It was Rockefeller
money (9$ million) that paid for the ground on which the United Nations
stands. It is Rockefeller money and the money of the many (over 1600) tax-exempt
Foundations (to include Ford and Carnegie) that bankroll this nation's
dash into One-Worldly/Feudalism.</P>

<P>It looks like it could be too late to fight such an awesome network
of power. But then again Information is the weapon THEY are afraid of.
</P>

<P>&quot;Keep your eyes &amp; ears open &amp; your mouth shut &amp; you'll
learn something.&quot;</P>

<P>MOONGATE : Chapter 10</P>

<P>Evidence of Extraterrestrial interference in the space program.</P>

<P>The UFO subject has been abused by many writers who produce books about
UFOs with seemingly little thought or hard analysis. Hopefully, information
contained in the remainder of this book will help explain certain aspects
of the UFO enigma in a more logical manner. This requires a better understanding
of how the universe functions and man's position in it. Every phenomenon
must have a rational basis, regardless of how bizarre it may seem to be.
In every case, the law of cause and effect must hold. If NASA fabricated
information, it will show up as a fabrication when it contradicts other
valid occurrences. The sum total of all phenomena must boil down to the
real picture of what happened.</P>

<P>Logic dictates that if UFOs occupied by intelligent beings are close
by, they must have a purpose in being here. If these beings are around,
actions taken by Earth people will probably be closely monitored by them.
The human beings who live on the outer surface of the Earth have an extremely
bad reputation for being killers. Historians can rationalize the wars based
on this or that reason; however, from the standponit of advanced civilizations
which are not part of the outer Earth world, the Earth's history would
be appalling. How could UFO occupants trust Earth nations to be benevolent
when these nations have such war-filled histories and are developing weapons
which are more and more powerful?</P>

<P>A great deal of information exists about Earth people who claim to have
been contacted by &quot;space&quot; people. Many of these contactees have
allegedly been told that the Earth is being carefully monitored. The primary
reason given for the monitoring is so that they will be able to quickly
curtail a nuclear war should it begin. If this is true, then missiles and
spacecraft would be closely observed to ensure that they carried no nuclear
warheads and did no damage to the EArth or Moon. Therefore, if UFO encounters
or sightings were made byt he astronauts, it should come as no surprise.
This would be especially true during the Apollo missions if these people
are stationed on the Moon. The present discussion will focus on the evidence
of extraterrestrials inadvertently supplied by NASA and other lunar observers.
Contactee encounters will be discussed in the next chapter.</P>

<P>Centuries ago, lunar observers noted transient phenomena which could
not be easily attributed to natural causes. For example, small dome-like
upswellings have appeared and disappeared on the Moon. In 1788, the astronomer
Schroeter attributed these domes to the industrial activities of the Selenite
(Moon) people. (1) Naturally, he was not taken seriously. However, over
200 of these white, circular domes have been observed and catalogued in
current times. (2) These hemispheres have varied in diameter between an
eighth and a quarter of a mile, with an average of one-quarter; and between
20 and 30 of them of similar size were seen clustered on the floor of Tycho
Crater. (3) These particular domes can not be attributed solely to rounded
hills or volcanic upswellings. Their unpredictable appearance and disappearance
indicates that they are intelligently created and movable structures.</P>

<P>Schroeter saw a shadow in the lunar Alps in 1788. (4) At first he saw
a light, but after the region had been illuminated, a round shadow appeared
where the light had been. Since the shadow was round, the object which
produced it was detached and above the lunar surface. After 15 minutes,
is supposedly disappeared. It is possible that Schroeter saw a large aerial
object which provided the illumination to create its own shadow. Many bright,
round spots have also been sighted inside craters such as Plato and the
Sea of Crisis. They frequently appear dome-like and change their brightness
from night to night. (5)</P>

<P>George Leonard supplied photographic evidence that the Moon is being
worked with massive machines in his book, Somebody Else Is on the Moon.
He suggested that damage done to the Moon's surface at one time is slowly
being repaired. He claims to have photographic evidence which shows craters
being worked on and perhaps mined. It is now known that the Moon is rich
in valuable elements which could be used for many purposes.</P>

<P>The evidence of extraterrestrial monitoring of the space program apparently
began with the Mercury missions and continued through Apollo 17. During
Cooper's fourth orbit over Hawaii in 1963, he heard a weird voice transmission
in an unintelligible language. The tapes were later analyzed and it was
determined that the sounds were not those of any known foreign language
on the Earth. (6) On the final orbit near Australia, he sighted a UFO from
the space capsule. (7) It was also allegedly seen by over 200 people at
the tracking station. (8)</P>

<P>Supposedly one or more UFOs were seen on each of the 12 Gemini missions.
After the 1966 Gemini 9 mission was scrubbed due to interference with the
radio hookup, NASA released a statement on television that UFOs or unknowns
had been seen by astronauts on several occasions. (9)</P>

<P>White and McDivitt saw and photographed an eggshaped, glowing, silvery
object which moved above and below them. Five frames with a movie camera
were taken as it flew by, and the film shows an egg-shaped object with
a fan-like glow and a long tail of light. The Mission Control report stated
that Command Pilot Jim McDivitt reported seeing another object in space
which appeared to have big arms sticking out. The report also indicated
that he took some motion pictures of the object, but had difficulty because
of the Sun. (10)</P>

<P>It is significant that Gemini 7 encountered a UFO and many little particles
traveling by the space capsule. The silvery UFO was not the rocket booster
because it was seen in addition to the UFO. (11) NASA commonly attributed
the particles observed in other missions to urine droplets or paint fragments
peeling off the spacecraft.</P>

<P>John Glen was the first astronaut to discover the &quot;fireflies&quot;
which were observed quite frequently throughout the space program. After
he had moved out of the night side of his first orbit, he glanced back
through the window and thought that the spacecraft had tumbled because
he saw &quot;stars.&quot; Glenn soon realized that the spacecraft had not
tumbled and that he was surrounded by yellowish-green, luminous particles
which looked like &quot;fireflies.&quot; They appeared to vary in size
between a pinhead and three-eights of an inch and were eight to ten feet
apart, evely distributed through the space around the capsule. Each time
the Sun came up, he observed these particles for about four minutes. Glenn
stated the following about them:</P>

<P>&quot;During the third sunrise I turned the spacecraft around and faced
forward to see if I could determine where the particles were coming from.
Facing forwards I could see only about ten percent as many particles as
I had when my back was to the sun. Still, they seemed to be coming toward
me from some distance so that they appeared not to be coming from the spacecraft.
Just what these particles are is stil subject to debate and awaits further
clarification.&quot; (12)</P>

<P>In spite of Glenn's clear statement that these particles did not come
from the spacecraft, orthodox authorities atributed them to flakes of material
coming off the capsule.</P>

<P>Although more UFO sightings could be reference involving the Gemini
missions, the most valuable information came from the Apollo flights. In
going around the Moon, Apollo 8 astronauts supposedly sighted a &quot;disc-shaped&quot;
object, experienced a &quot;blinding light&quot;, and herd &quot;intolerably
high-frequency noises&quot; from their radio. (13) Later, they sighted
the object again with more of the brilliant light and experienced &quot;a
wave of internal heat within the space capsule.&quot; (14) The spacecraft
supposedly began to &quot;pitch and yaw&quot; before control was regained.
(15) It is also significant that when the astronauts came around theeastern
edge of the Moon, all the water in a radiator in the spacecraft's cooling
system had evaporated and had to be replenished! (16)</P>

<P>According to official accounts, Apollo 10 had a close call when Cernan
and Stafford descended to within 50,000 feet of the lunar surface to inspect
the APollo 11 landing site. It seems that after the descent stage was jettisoned,
the upper stage went into a wild spin, pitching up and down. Something
caused the gyro-guidance system to go out of control, and to steady the
ship, Stafford took over the hand controls. Supposedly, a control switch
had beee left in the wrong position by technicians and was not spotted
by Stafford. However, official accounts do not mention that a UFO rose
vertically from below and that it was photographed. (17)</P>

<P>The first Apollo 11 UFO encounter occurred one day into the flight.
The astronauts sighted an unknown which appeared between them and the Moon
which might have been the booster rocket. In the debriefing, Aldrin stated
that they recalled having trouble with the high gain at about the same
time as the sighting. Coolins mentioned that they felt a bump and Armstrong
indicated that Collins thought the MESA (Modularized Equipment Stowage
Assembly) had come off. Aldrin then recalled seeing all sorts of little
objects going by prior to seeing the brighter object which had an L-shape
to it. Armstrong compared it to two connected rings, but Aldrin disagreed
and described it as a hollow cylinder. Collins re-entered the conversation
and asserted that it looked like a hollow cylinder which was tumbling,
but would change to an open-book shape. (18)</P>

<P>There are some significant items of information in the above conversation.
First of all, Aldrin stated that they wer having a problem with the high
gain about the time of the sighting. Collins mentioned that they felt a
bump, but then decided against this idea after Armstrong commented on the
MESA package. As the dialogue progresed, the astronauts began talking about
the shape of the object. It seems that these three, trained observers could
not or would not agree on what they saw. Each man seemed to have a picture
of what it was, yet after Collins explicitly described it as a cylinder,
Aldrin stated that it was not a cylinder. Armstrong said that it looked
like two connected rings.</P>

<P>When Apollo 11 was near the Moon, weird radio noises were heard which
sounded like fire engines, sirens, buxx-saws, and train whistles. Mission
Control supposedly asked if someone else was up there with them. These
signals or noises came from outside the spacecraft and also allegedly persisted
intermittently throughout the first few days of the flight. (19)</P>

<P>According to one undisclosed source, after Armstrong and Aldrin landed
on the Moon, immense UFOs lined up on the far side of the crater and monitored
the astronauts. (20) Another reference to this event appeared in the National
Enquirer, September 11, 1979. (21) In the story, a formber consultant to
NASA claims that the event occurred but was covered up. According to the
article, the encounter was common knowledge in NASA.</P>

<P>The reader is reminded that some of this information is limited and
perhaps questionable concerning the subject matter of NASA UFO sightings.
If the accounts were evaluated solely on their own, the case would not
be totally proven by any means. However, in conjunction with all of the
evidence which remains, and all that has been presented prior to this,
the incidents are more believable.</P>

<P>Apollo 12 nearly experienced a complete electrical shutdown shortly
after take-off. The ship appeared to be hit by bolts of lighting 36 1/2
and 52 seconds after launch; but since there was no thunderstorm in teh
area, the event had to be explained from another standpoint. Some people
speculated that the rocket created an electrical conductor to ground from
the ionized exhaust and that lighting discharged through the ship. However,
one source claims that observatories in Europe reported two unknown objects
in the craft's vicinity as it headed toward the Moon. (22) One object appeared
to be following Apollo 12 and the other was ahead of it. Both were blinking
on and off rapidly. The following day the astronauts reported two UFOs
or bogeys about 132,000 miles out, and during their conversations with
Mission Control, one of the objects flew off at high speed. (23) As allegedly
received by Ground Control which did not come from the space capsule but
from elsewhere. The noise was also supposedly heard by the atronauts and
was described as static, whistles, and a constant beeping sound. (24)</P>

<P>The subject of fireflies has been mentioned several times. When the
Apollo 16 astronauts were coasting towards the Moon, they entered a region
of space swarming with these particles. However, NASA insists that they
were flakes of paint which was applied to keep the craft from overheating
in the Sun. But again, accompanying this occurrence, Mattingly reported
that problems had arisen with the guidance and navigation systems. There
was no attitude indication and the gimbal platform had locked. A manual
realighment became necessary and the &quot;snowflakes&quot; traveling with
the ship interfered with the star sightings. Typically, no one determined
what happened; they merely suggested that another &quot;electronic glitch&quot;
had occurrec. Somehow, electrical transients were created in the electrical
circuitry which created temporary malfunctions which later disappeared.
Before the Apollo 16 descent, another bad circuit in the steering system
controlling the main rocket engine occurred. This caused the engine bell
to oscillate sideways. (25)</P>

<P>It appears that electronic glitches, UFO sightings, and luminous particles
may be related phenomena. An examination of this relationship provides
a great deal of information about what may have really happened to the
astronauts. John Glenn saw luminous particles for about four minutes during
every orbit when coming into the Sun. He clearly stated that they came
toward the capsule from a distance. Glenn may have been observing the disintegration
of certain particles which are emited continuously by the Sun. Accumulated
evidence indicates that they fill the space between planets and galazies,
and that their constituent particles probably consist of photons of light.
When these particles disintegrate, photons are released. The nature of
these particles may be intimately connected with the energies used to propel
the UFOs which were allegedly seen by some of the astronauts. When UFOs
came in close proximity to the NASA spacecraft, the concentration of these
&quot;firefly&quot; particles may have increased tremendously. The particles
seem to carry and electrical charge and penetrate readily through the material
of a spacecraft. If they disintegrate when interacting with matter and
other particles in space, the astronauts would see them inside and outside
their ships. The effect of these particles on the spacecraft would be to
cause overloading of electrical systems and electronic noise in the radio
communication circuits. Since they may be emitted in high concentrations
by UFOs, objects in the vicinity would be bathed in them sufficiently to
cause the overloads and short-circuiting. For example, Apollo 10's guidance
system could have been short-circuited by these particles from an approaching
UFO.</P>

<P><A NAME="- 4"></A>- 4 -</P>

<P>The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor</P>

<P>(A Case Study In Police State Tactics In America)</P>

<P>On Monday, April 18, 1993 the U.S. government, in an act of mass murder
unrivaled in U.S. history (intended to send a warning to gun owners and
so-called &quot;religious nuts&quot; across the country), burned 86 people,
including 24 children to death in the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,
Texas - climaxing a 51 day seige launched by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms, (BATF) on February 28, 1993. As editorialist Charley Reese
recently wrote: &quot;When you start with an &quot;allegation&quot; that
a gun control law has been violated, and you end up with nearly 100 people,
including 25 children, killed, and millions of taxpayers dollars down the
drain, that's bad law enforcement no matter how you slice it.&quot;</P>

<P>Koresh and his followers held no hostages, had committed no violent
crimes, were not threatening to kill or harm anyone. They were minding
their own business on their own property. Everyone in the compound was
there of their own free will. Texas social workers had been in the compound
and found no indication that any outsider who visited the compound would
be in any danger. One of the children living in the compound told her father,
according to him, that &quot;it was a joy to live there.&quot;</P>

<P>A massive coverup by the Clintonistas, the FBI, the BATF, and the Establishment-controlled
media has pacified the great majority of the American public in spite of
the worst massacre of men, women and children by our government in U.S.
history. President Clinton and the Establishment's message in the aftermath
was clear: Let this be a warning to religious misfits, dissidents, gun
regulations violators, Constitutionalists., and traditionalists: Get in
our way, oppose us, or thumb your nose at us and we will destroy you -
by fire if necessary.</P>

<P>What a horror to watch men, women and children burned to death for no
other crime than resisting the omnipotent state. It is a chilling example
of the police state that is emerging in American with ominous parallels
to Nazi Germany, which &quot;coincidentally&quot; massacred hundreds of
Jews in the Warsaw ghetto exactly 50 years earlier on April 19, 1943. Gun
control, people control, persecution of religious minorities, and incredible
ruthlessness and wickedness were all part of the Third Reich in Germany
and are part of the Fourth Reich emerging in America today.</P>

<P>The Branch Davidians were not the first (nor will they be the last)
group the BATF has attacked for &quot;alleged&quot; gun control violations.
Last year alone, the BATF raided over 2,000 homes or businesses with a
number of innocent victims killed, and tens of millions in assets seized
and hundreds of Americans jailed, in their quest for the Holy Grail called
gun control.</P>

<P>And it should be realized that this gestapo-like organization did not
just arrive with Bill Clinton. It came on stream in 1968 with the Gun Control
Act of 1968 and has been growing in power and in its attacks on the American
people ever since.</P>

<P>As syndicated columnist Paul Craig Roberts noted: &quot;the tragedy
near Waco happened precisely because of federal laws regulating gun ownership.
T he Branch Davidians hadn't assaulted anyone. They lived peacefully in
the community. Except for federal gun laws they would all still be alive.
It is the liberal premise that gun ownership is evil, should be illegal
or at least heavily regulated, and that has created an atmoshpere in which
the BATF like an unthinking bully, can run roughshod over Americans' constitutional
rights, due process, and freedom.&quot; [ED NOTE: And as the gun control
legislation described above passes, BATF attacks on honest law-abiding
gun owners are likely to grow 10-fold!]</P>

<P>It is obvious that the government (and the BATF) wanted a highly publicized
&quot;victory&quot; over gun owners and &quot;religious nuts,&quot; and
thanks to the whitewashing and coverup by the Administration and the media,
the American people have by-and-large slept through the most unspeakable
slaughter of innocents in U.S. history. In spite of all the mess-ups, the
government has its victory, gun owners and religious groups across America
now live in fear of similar treatment at the hands of Clinton's Gestapo,
and the momentum toward gun control, toward persecution of Christians and
other minority religious groups, traditionalists, and Constitutionalists,
and towards a socialist America and the New World Order continues to accelerate.</P>

<P>If the inhabitants of Mt. Carmel had been dangerous terrorists, drug
dealers, or enemies on the battlefield, the government attack could not
have been more brutal.</P>

<P>After the initial attack (02/28/93) Former McClennon County Texas District
Attorney Vic Feazell blamed the BATF for the deadly confrontation, accusing
them of &quot;a vulgar display of power&quot;.</P>

<P>In 1987, Feazell helped lead an investigation of the Davidians and their
firearms, in which they wer completely exonerated from any illegal activity.
&quot;We treated them like human beings rather than stormtrooping the place.&quot;</P>

<P>Likewise, Jack Harwell, the McClennon County SHeriff, called Koresh
on the telephone and informed him of the charges, and asked him to turn
himself in, along with six others and surrender their weapons. When deputies
arrived at the Church grounds, Koresh and the other Davidian members peacefully
complied. Feazell said of the Davidians, &quot;They're protective of what's
theirs. They're protective of their land. They view their land as Muslims
to Mecca and Jews view Jerusalem...if they'd (the BATF) called and talked
to them, the Davidians would've given them what they wanted.&quot;</P>

<P>Feazell's view of the BATF blundering has been seconded by anti-terrorists
expert Col. Charlie Beckwith, the founder of the U.S. Army's Dellta Force
Commando unit. He has told reporters the BATF raid was an &quot;embarrassment&quot;
Beckwith faulted the plan implemented by the VATF, saying the intelligence
behind it was responsible for the disaster.</P>

<P>Subsequent to the first BATF attack Feazell predicted that the government
would kill all the Davidians, and after the massacre (the second attack)
he said that they intended to kill these people from the beginning to cover
the tracks of their own crimes they committed by raiding the compound to
begin with.</P>

<P>After the original public relations disaster on 2/28, the government
strategy seems to have evolved over the next 51 days as follows:</P>

<P>First, through a massive media discrediting of the Davidians through
the &quot;party line&quot; press over several weeks.</P>

<P>Second, by slowly preparing the public to believe that all of the people
remaining in the compound were under the total control of an unpredictable
psychopath, and to expect a mass suicide, yet saying that there was no
reason for them to believe that Koresh would carry out a mass suicide.</P>

<P>Third, to cloak their act in righteousness (as tyranny always does)
by saying their efforst on Monday were to force the people out by using
non-lethal CS gas &quot;for the sake of the children.&quot;</P>

<P>USING CS GAS ON CHILDREN-President Clinton, Janet Reno, and their FBI/BATF
employees have described CS gas as &quot;a harmless tear has, an irritant,
designed to cause the mothers to grab their children and run out of the
building.&quot; No one in the police or military who has ever used CS gas
believes this. CS gas (O-chlorobenzylidene malonitrate) has been banned
as a chemical warfare battlefield agent by the Chemical Weapons COnvention
signed in Paris in January by the U.S. and over 130 other nations. Used
during the Nietnam War to flush Vietcong from hidden tunnels, the gas causes
dizziness, disorientation, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea,
burning of the sking, intense tearing, temporary blindness, coughing, and
vomiting-in short it is designed to blind and disable (very different from
&quot;relatively harmless&quot;). CS gas is a battlefield incapacitating
gas.</P>

<P>On March 10, The Houston Chronicle reported that former Houston police
SWAT commander Lt. Jim Gunn said that &quot;CS gas can get into a child's
lungs and cause congestion and kill them.&quot; Benjamin C. Garrett, executive
director of teh Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute in Alexandria,
VA said in the Washington Times (4/23/93) that: &quot;the CS would have
most harshly affected the children in the compound. The reaction would
have intensified for the children since the smaller you are, the sooner
you would feel response.&quot; It is important to note that the children
did not have gas masks (they were too small to wear them).</P>

<P>Beth Stephens, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a
public interest law firm based in New York, said &quot;tests have documented
at least 80 deaths caused by exposure to CS gas. Tests have found that
CS is a toxic substance which is highly dangerous to people who inhale
its fumes, particularly when in confined areas.&quot; CS was pumped into
the Mt. Carmel compound (an enclosed area) for six hours before the facility
caught fire and burned to the ground.</P>

<P>The Washington Times (4/22/93) wrote: &quot;'The powerful chemical teh
FBI used at the Branch Davidian compound would have turned the cult children's
last moments into a final hell,' chemical experts said yesterday. 'It would
have panicked the children whose eyes would have involuntarily shut. Their
throats and lungs would have been blurning. They would have been coughing
wildly,' said Benjamin Garrett. ' Eventually they would have been vomiting
in a final hell'&quot; [ED NOTE: THis is the gas CLinton, Reno, and their
underlings described as a &quot;harmless irritant.&quot;]</P>

<P>This writer has talked to a half dozen special forces, military, and
police personnel who all agree that CS is a highly toxic battlefield immobilization
gas. &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz told this writer that: &quot;CS gas is not just
an irritant; it is designed to knock you down and makes you incapable of
any practicle functions.&quot; That our government would use it on women
and children (thereby immobilizing them and preventing them from running
from the building) is creul, inhuman, and unspeakable evil and is the kind
of thing the Nazis and Communists would have relished in..</P>

<P>THE GOVERNMENT COVERUP: OPERATION DAMAGE CONTROL (OR WHITE WASH) The
U.S. government has refined the art of political coverup to a science.
They have had practice: 1) The POW/MIA Coverup after World War II, Korea,
and Vietnam whereby thousands of American POWs and servicement were left
in the hands of the communists; 2) The Kennedy Assassinations (John and
Bobby) Coverup which is now in its 31st year; 3) The Watergate Coverup
which ultimately backfired on Nixon and Company; 4) The AIDS Coverup presently
being perpetrated by the government (and particularly the CDC) to hide
the extent and magnitude of the AIDS crisis; and, now, 5) The Waco Massacre
Coverup.</P>

<P>a) BURNING AND BULLDOZING THE EVIDENCE: The BATF (and other government
agencies) love to burn, bulldoze or cremate the evidence. In the Weaver
case, the government tried to burn out the Weaver cabin by dumping fuel
on the cabin via helicopter and only an alert reporter waving a camera
in the air saved the surviving Weavers from the same fate as the Branch
Davidians. Shortly after Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris and the three Weaver
girls came out of the cabin, the BATF and FBI grabbed the bodies of Vicki
and Sam Weaver and had them cremated. Therefore, no trial evidence from
autopsies. (Sam Weaver, age 14, was shot several times in the back by the
marshals, Vicki in the head by an FBI sniper).</P>

<P>In Waco, on April 19, crucial physical evidence and key witnesses were
consumed by fire. Then on May 12, FBI officials, citing the fear that someone
might fall in the bunker (though the entire site was fenced and guarded),
and a need to fill holes and cover trash and raw sewage for safety and
health reasons, rolled bulldozers across the burned out compound completely
obliterating any remaining evidence.</P>

<P>b) SILENCING BATF AND FBI AGENTS - Shortly after the original BATF attack,
two agents came forward on TV in New York (though their faces were not
shown) and said they were afraid of a coverup. All BATF agents have already
been threatened by the Washington office of BATF with the possiblity of
being punished, dismissed, or prosecuted for speaking publicaly about the
raid. The agency is struggling to keep these agents silent. Four of their
comrades died because of bungling, malfeasance, and mendacity at the top
of the BATF.</P>

<P>c) THE SO CALLED &quot;INDEPENDENT&quot; ARSON TEAM HAD CLOSE TIES WITH
THE BATF The Clintonistas, immediately after the fire, suggested an &quot;independent&quot;
investigation to investigate the burned out Branch Davidian compound site
and confirm the &quot;truth.&quot; That &quot;independent&quot; investigator,
who claimed the fire had been set by the Davidians (based, he said, on
infrared photos taken from a helicopter) was employee (who had been on
a joint BATF task force for 10 years) and long time contractor for the
FBI, whose wife is personal secretary to the head of the Houston BATF -
where the whole raid was planned. The FBI controlled the crime scene for
three weeks following the holocaust, letting no Texas Rangers, local police
or truly independent arson investigators in, and then bulldozed the entire
site on May 12. (So, now, no one else can investigate the burnt out compound.)</P>

<P>d) THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT INVESTIGATE THE DECISIONS FOR THE
FINAL ASSAULT - Although Bill Clinton promised a &quot;vigorous and through&quot;
investigation of the handling of the entire Waco affair, on May 15 the
Justice Department said it would not investigate the decision making process
associated with the final assault. (This is like saying in a murder case
we will not investigate who pulled the trigger or who gave the order to
pull the ttrigger, or in Watergate, not investigating who gave the order
for the Watergate breakin). As the New York Times (5/16/93) said: &quot;Clinton
officials said that since Ms. Reno has been widely supported in Congress,
and since polls show that the majority of Americans supported her decision
to use tear gas, and blame the cult members themselves for the final deadly
fire, department officials concluded that nothing could be gained by looking
more closely at her order to carry out the assault.&quot;</P>

<P>e) LIES THE GOVERNMENT TOLD DURING AND AFTER OPERATION WACO - &quot;Governments
are constituted to lie to the greatest number of people the greater part
of the time.&quot; Machiavelli, in The Prince. BATF, FBI, and Clinton Administration
officials have consistently lied and contradicted themselves since the
siege of Mt. Carmel began. Just a few of a growing list of the lies include:</P>

<P>1. The media was told the day before the raid (2/27) to get ready for
a big blowout and to get their TV cameras in place. The BATF originally
denied it told the media, but later admitted that it had..</P>

<P>2. The BATF said that Koresh had to be arrested at the compound because
he had not left it for several months. Numerous people in the area said
that was a lie and that they had frequently seen him out jogging, at the
store, and in town until shortly before the attack. The BATF finally admitted
they knew nothing about Koresh's movement because they NEVER even put him
under surveillance, let alone did they try to arrest him.</P>

<P>3. The BATF originally said that they had an arrest warrant for Koresh
and a search warrant for the compound. Later it was shown that they only
had a search warrant and no arrest warrant.</P>

<P>4. The BATF said that the element of surprise was the key to success
and that they wouldn't have attacked if they had known that the Branch
Davidians were expecting them. This was a lie. Everyone in town, including
the Branch Davidians, knew about hte coming attack. They moved a whole
army of men and equipment up to the compound. Later BATF director Higgins
admitted that they knew they had lost the element of surprise and went
ahead with the attack anyway. That decision caused the death of four BATF
agents.</P>

<P>5. The BATF told the Texas National Guard (in order to obtain use of
their helicopters), that there was an illegal drug lab at the compound.
There was no evidence of this before, during, or after the raid according
to the WACO Tribune-Herald (03/28/93).</P>

<P>6. On March 6, FBI officers denied that they had any plans to use psychological
warfare techniques against the Branch Davidians (i.e., such as loud rock
music, bright lights, weird sounds[animals being slaughtered]). The FBI
used them constantly throughout the seige.</P>

<P>7. In his press conference the evening of the fire, Bill Clinton said
Janet Reno had acted &quot;because of the children&quot; who were &quot;being
abused.&quot; Later, officials admitted that there was no evidence of child
abuse.</P>

<P>8. On March 2, the FBI's Bob Ricks told reporters that when the FBI
approached Koresh, he was going to go outside with grenades (in front of
the TV cameras), pull the pin, commit suicide and take as many agents with
him as he could. On 4/20 on MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour FBI Director William
Sessions said that all fo the FBI analysis of Koresh indicated that he
would NEVER commit suicide.</P>

<P>9. On April 28, FBI Deputy Director Floyd Clarke told the House Judiciary
Committee that the &quot;Branch Davidians had used their own children as
human shields by holding them up in front of the windows.&quot; The truth
is, the Branch Davidians hoisted their children up to the windows to see
the M1-A1 Abrams battle tanks sitting in their front yard, as FBI spokesman
Richard Swensen later admitted.</P>

<P>10. BATF Director Stephen Higgins testified before a Senate subcommittee
(04/02/93) that the BATF mission failed only &quot;because the Branch Davidians
ambushed the BATF.&quot; This is a lie. The BATF attacked the Branch Davidians
and not the other way arround. (Video Footage Clearly Shows this).</P>

<P>11. The FBI and Janet Reno stated repeatedly that the reason they attacked
the compound on April 19 was &quot;concern for the safety and well being
of the children&quot; This was a lie! You don't ram into buildings with
military tanks and pump CS gas ( a gas so deadly and debilitating that
it has been banned by international treaty for use in warfare) into a building
filled with women and children.&quot;</P>

<P>12. CS gas was described by Clinton, Reno and FBI officials as a harmless
(irritant) tear gas. This is a lie. It is 80 times stronger than tear gas,
immobilizes its victims and throws them into violent coughing and convulsions
(i.e. the &quot;perfect&quot; weapon for a police state to use against
young women &amp; children).</P>

<P>13. Clinton said on 04/20/93 that CS was a &quot;tear gas which had
been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or children.&quot;
That is a lie. (See Above)</P>

<P>14. The government said they had exhausted all avenues to resolve the
standoff. This is a lie. They refused to let any of the family members
speak with the Branch Davidians even though this has helped to resolve
many such former standoffs. They refused to let &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz and
Jack McLamb, who negotiated Randy Weaver and his family out last August,
assist, although they volunteered numerous times.</P>

<P>15. The BATF said after the February 28 fiasco that &quot;we were outgunned..&quot;
Another lie. They had helicopter gunships, armored vehicles, and fully
automatic weapons to use against the Branch Davidians, not to mention stun
grenades and the military's most high tech equipment.</P>

<P>16. George Stephanopoulos said: &quot;The children were being abused,
even to instruction on how to clamp down on cyanide pills.&quot; Though
this makes for chilling headlines, the FBI has denied that this was true.</P>

<P>17. On April 19, FBI spokesman Bob Rocks quoted Branch Davidian survivor
Renos Avraam as saying: &quot;The fire's been lit. The fire's been lit.&quot;
But when questioned on camera by reporters, Avraam said: &quot;One of the
tanks knocked over a gas lantern, and it started a fire under some bales
of hay that were laying around. The fire wasn't started by us.&quot;</P>

<P>PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PRESS CONFERENCE AND DAMAGE CONTROL - President
Clinton gave a Rose Garden press conference on 04/20/93 in which he defended
and sought to justify Reno's, The FBI's and BATF's actions in Waco. The
lies and distortions which Clinton told in that press conference were incredible:</P>

<P>1. &quot;The Branch Davidians had illegally stockpiled weapons and ammunition.&quot;
[ED. NOTE: That was only suspected, but never proven. Shouldn't the government
have proven that before they killed almost 100 people? Is it now lawful
to kill people during investigations of wrongdoing? Lawful or not, it is
now commonplace in America!]</P>

<P>2. Koresh &quot;placed innocent children at risk.&quot; [ED NOTE: There
was no risk until the government attacked the compound. Wasn't it Reno,
the BATF, and FBI that put the innocent children at risk?]</P>

<P>3. &quot;The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the
individual with whom they were dealing David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational,
and probably insane.&quot; [ED NOTE: None of the townspeople who knew Koresh
observed this, nor did the former Distric Attorney of McClennon County,
nor the sheriff's deputies who knew him. He did have strange religious
views, but most of the townspeople who knew him liked him.]</P>

<P>4. Clinton said the April 19 FBI attack on the Branch Davidians was
&quot;an effort to protect the young hostages. &quot; [ED NOTE: The government
didn't protect them, they killed them. And, the children were not hostages.
They were hthere of their own free will. The Waco seige was never a hostage
crisis.]</P>

<P>5. Clinton said: &quot;The [FBI] plan included a decision to withhold
the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead use tear gas
that would not cause permanent damage.&quot; [ED. NOTE: No one knows who
fired at who during the final seige, because the press were kept two miles
away, unless one wants to accept Clinton's word, and the government did
not use tear gas - it was highly lethal, flammable CS gas (as discussed
above).]</P>

<P>6. Clinton said: &quot;Mr. Koresh's response to the demand for his surrenter
by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were
his captives...He killed those he controlled.&quot; [ED NOTE: There is
no evidence that Koresh murdered any children; it is open to question whether
at the last moment he shot himself; and the chidlren (according to local
townspeople, Branch Davidian survivors, and Texas social workers, were
NOT captives.]</P>

<P>7. Clinton said: &quot;I hope very much that others who will be tempted
to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will
be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.&quot;
[ED NOTE: Is this a not so veiled threat that if you belong to an unpopular,
misfit, non-mainstream religious group, the same thing could happen to
you? The intimidation value from the Waco inferno for the government against
small religious grounps, conservative, patriotic, pro-life, or non-mainstream
groups is incredible. Conform or we'll destroy you!]</P>

<P>8. When asked by a reporter, &quot;Why now,&quot; Clinton replied: &quot;There
was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their
limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.
They might be needed in other parts of the country.&quot; [ED NOTE: Limited
resources? This is the government which is giving billions of dollars to
Russia in aid and requesting billions more for 1001 boondoggles. And as
far as spreading the &quot;experts&quot; too thin, there were only a few
hundred troops and agents there. The government has tens of thousands of
federal agents and allegedly over a million military personnel.]</P>

<P>9. Clinton said: &quot;The danger of them [the Branch Davidians] doing
something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease,
with the passage of time.&quot; [ED NOTE: Quite to the contrary, as time
went by, the likelyhood that they wwould come out increased, according
to experts who have dealt with many of these types of crises.]</P>

<P>10. Clinton said: &quot;They [the FBI] had reason to believe that the
children inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as
being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.&quot; [ED NOTE:
There was no evidence of child abuse according to several Texas social
workers who had visited the compound. However, the gassing (with CS gas)
and burning of the children by the Clintonistas does seem to this writer
to qualify as child abuse. And if the conditions were unsanitary and unsafe
in the compound it was because the government had turned off the water,
head and electricity 50 days earlier. Government gunfire into the building
might also qualify as &quot;an unsafe condition.&quot;]</P>

<P>FLYING SAUCERS: THE REAL STORY</P>

<P>Popular Science Feb '95</P>

<P>From the hopeless tangle of claims and counterclaims emerges the documented
fact that secret military research HAS explored flying saucer flight.</P>

<P>Exposed and utterly alone beneath the incandescent starts of the Nevada
desert, I dropped my pack and squirmed the last few yards to the summet
of White Sides Mountain. Carrying only a pair of binoculars, a tape recorder
and a radio scanner, I groped over the rocks, knowing that carelessness
now would waste all my care in getting here: the long, 4-wheel-drive detour
to avoid road sensors that alert base security, the zigzag hike through
the sage brush, the pains taken to stay off ridgelines where I might be
profiled against the sky.</P>

<P>Pulling myself up to peer over the last jagged parapet, I was sure for
the first time in hours that I was in the right place. Across 12 miles
of darkened scrub, just beneath the far horizon glimmered Dreamland, a
splash of gemlike lights tossed into a hollow in the hills. Also known
as Area 51, it's a terrestrial black hole into which it's estimated millions
of tax dollars disappear each day while hardly a word of explanation escapes.</P>

<P>A complex of hangars, giant parabolic antennas and one of the longest
runways on Earth, Area 51 spreads the length of Nevada's remote Groom Lake
dry lake bed. For four decades-through the top-secret U-2 spyplane program
of the '50s, the SR-71 spyplane of the '60s, the F-117A stealth fighter
of the '80s-Groom Lake has been where our government has come when it wants
to be alone.</P>

<P>Now, five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the lights of Groom
Lake still burn throughout the night with wartime urgency. And whatever
secrets lie there are guarded with undiminished vigilance. Armed, unidentified
men stalk the sagebrush in camouflage fatigues. Unmarked Black Hawk helicopters
sweep the hills. Electronic sensors hidden along the approaching roads
report the presence of vehicular traffic. Keep in mind that you're subject
to all of this on public land, before you make it to the border marked
with signs reading &quot;use of deadly force authorized.&quot;</P>

<P>UFO capital</P>

<P>It was not until this past summer; amid mounting publicity, that the
Air Force gave up denying the undeniable. &quot;We do have facilities within
the complex near the dry lake bed of Groom Lake,&quot; says its latest
official statement. The Air Force adds that the Nellis Range Complex-of
which Groom Lake is a part-is &quot;used for testing and training technologies,
operations and systems critical to the effectiveness of U.S. military forces.
Specific activities conducted at Nellis cannot be discussed any further
than that.&quot;</P>

<P>But that, of course, is only the beginning of the discussion. With so
much unexplained, speculation naturally ranges from the merely exotic to
the otherworldly. Glenn Campbell, a former computer programmer who has
studied and written about the base fulltime since moving to the tiny nearby
town of Rachel a year and a half ago, fondly refers to his adopted neighborhood
as &quot;the UFO capital,&quot; and &quot;America's most popular secret
airbase.&quot;</P>

<P>Articles and TV specials have theorized endlessly about Groom Lake.
Aerospace technology enthusiasts point to the likelihood that Lockheed
would be testing a hypersonic spyplane there, just as it earlier tested
the SR-71. But what has really established Groom Lake as a place of pilgrimage
for UFO watchers is the lure of the flying saucer.</P>

<P>It was this same fascination-one that has gripped America since the
term first came into common parlance 47 years ago-that brought me to Groom
Lake this past fall. It stands to reason that if our military has flying
saucers, this is where they'd be.</P>

<P>But as it turned out, Groom Lake was only the beginning of the story.
Sure, it is possible that there are flying saucers somewhere in the Nellis
Range Complex. Given the level of secrecy almost anything is possible,
and there are in face a number of intriguing claims to this effect. But
more fascinating is the verifiable fact that these would not be the first
flying saucers our government has hidden from us.</P>

<P>First Sighting</P>

<P>Think back to 1947, to a world sick of war and an America racing to
build its nuclear deterrent against the looming Soviet threat. In June
of that year, while flying his private plane near Washington's Mount Rainier,
Kenneth Arnold said he spotted &quot;a chain of nine peculiar-looking aircraft&quot;
that &quot;flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.&quot;
By timing their passage between tow peaks, he later estimated their ground
speed to be about 1700 mph.</P>

<P>Arnold, a deputy federal marshal and successful businessman, was a difficult
witness to dismiss. His sighting was widely reported and thoroughly investigated,
eventually by the Army Air Force (AAF), which feared he might have seen
some new Soviet secret weapon.</P>

<P>But first another possibility had to be ruled out: Was it one of ours?
Accordingly to Curtis Peebles' Watch The Skies!, a history of the flying
saucer phenomenon recently published by the Smithsonian, an early suspect
was a formerly secret Navy fighter program. &quot;Are you positive the
Navy junked the XF5U-1 project?&quot; asked one 1947 AAF memo.</P>

<P>America's first saucer</P>

<P>Built by Chance Vought of Stratford, Connecticut, the XF5U-1 &quot;Flying
Flapjack&quot; was the closest thing anybody knew of to a flying saucer.
Although capable of nothing like the 1700 mph reported by Arnold, its bizarre
circular plan-form nonetheless promised performance unlike anything that
had come before.</P>

<P>The program traces back to the 1930s, when National Advisory Committee
on Aeronautics engineer Charles Zimmerman flew a series of unmanned models
that led him to the Flapjack shape. The extraordinary virtue of the design
was that it defied what had seemed a fundamental aerodynamic tradeoff.
The Flapjack managed both the high top speeds desirable for combat and
the low stalling speeds needed to operate out of small airfields, or off
the decks of ships. In face, with enough engine power, it could hang by
its props, and take off vertically, without any airstrip at all.</P>

<P>The saucer shape's high-speed performance came from the fact that it
was essentially a very low aspect ratio wing - a wing with a low ratio
of length to width-like that on a modern fighter jet. Although stubby wings
can be shaped to produce relatively little drag at high speeds, they suffer
badly at low speeds. The cause is partly that large amounts of air spill
up from under the wingtips and swirl into tornado-like vortices that trail
behind the aircraft. Zimmerman limited this induced drag by placing the
Flashback's propellers at its edges and gearing them so that they counteracted
the vortices.</P>

<P>This simple idea proved out remarkably well in more than 100 flights
by a manned test craft called the V-173. In late 1942, the NAVY okayed
construction of two full-scale prototypes. Powered by a pair of 1600-horsepower
Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp radials, the XF5U-1 was expected to fly at
up to 425 miles per hour and yet alight daintily at as little as 40 mph.
Based on his experience with the V-173, Zimmerman predicted that a turbine-powered
Flapjack would eventually reach 550 mph, while takeoff and landing speeds
would dwindle to zero.</P>

<P>We'll never know if he was right. The XF5U-1 prototypes were ready by
1947, but never flew. The Navy by this time decided to throw its full weight
behind more orthodox jet fighters and ordered the XF5U-1 destroyed. No
plane did what the Flapjack promised to do until the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel-a
precursor to today's Harrier vertical-takeoff attack fighter-began flying
in the 1960s.</P>

<P>As 1947 drew to a close, the Arnold sighting and a number of others
remained unresolved. The XF5U-1 wasn't behind them. Nor did they seem to
be anything within the reach of Soviet technology. An exhaustive review
of Nazi wartime research hadn't turned up any explanations either. The
newly instituted U.S. Air Force took very seriously the possibility that
something we didn't understand was roaming our airspace. It secretly launched
Project Sign, the first of a series of UFO investigations that were to
stretch on for more than 20 years.</P>

<P>Shape of the future</P>

<P>As the Air Force pondered reports of unbelievable high-performance flying
discs, engineers grew more and more intrigued by the aerodynamic and structural
properties of such a shape. A lengthy and detailed patent applied for by
the Lockheed Aircraft Corp. in 1953 describes an &quot;aircraft of circular
plan-form a nd of bi-convex vertical cross section&quot; - basically, a
giant lentil. As with the Flying Flapjack, the benefits foreseen included
a combination of high forward speeds (better than Mach 4 in this case)
and vertical takeoff and landing capability.</P>

<P>The patent enumerates several properties that suit a saucer to those
goals. The shape, it claims, provides excellent structural rigidity, aerodynamic
stability in vertical ascent and descent, and room inside for large amounts
of payload and fuel. Furthermore, its smooth profile and unbroken leading
and trailing edges were though to lend it inherent aerodynamic efficiency.</P>

<P>There's no record of Lockheed's radical craft ever getting off the drawing
board, but it seems somehow fitting that there should be an early link
between Lockheed and a saucer. As creator of the U2, SR-71 and F-117A,
Lockheed's name intertwines with Groom Lake's from the beginning. And saucers,
of course, are what people come here to see.</P>

<P>Weapon System 606A</P>

<P>Around the time Lockheed applied for its patent, Britain's Avro Aircraft,
builder of some of World War II's most successful bombers, began work on
a more practical saucer at its plant near Toronto, Canada. Under a Canadian
government contract, Avro sketched out a vehicle that harnesses a newly
discovered benefit of the circular wing. Jetted down from the wing's perimeter,
a circular curtain of thrust created a &quot;bubble&quot; of high pressure
air that resulted in very efficient vertical lift, much like a hovercraft
but without the flexible skirt.</P>

<P>Avro designed this effect into a GETOL (Ground Effect Takeoff and Landing)
craft that used it to get airborne, then gradually directed thrust aft
until lift on the circular wing took over. Canada soon decided it couldn't
afford to pursue the idea, but the U.S. Air Force saw it as a way out of
a troubling Cold War vulnerability.</P>

<P>Fearing that Soviet strikes on European airfields could all too easily
take out planes out of a fight, the Air Force picked up funding for Avro's
GETOL work in 1954. Under a highly classified program designated Weapon
System 606A, it developed a concept plane with a top speed of 1000 mph.</P>

<P>Considering it would be years before a fighter without GETOL capabilities
went that fast, this was a radical proposition. To lower the stakes, the
Air Force joined the Army in funding construction of a slower, simpler
test craft. The result was one of the strangest machines in the annals
of military aviation.</P>

<P>The VZ-9V Avrocar bristled with untried ideas. Buried at the center
of its 18-ft-dia. circular wing was a 5-ft. fan, surrounded by three turbojets
lying on their sides in a triangle. Jet exhaust spun the fan by blowing
over turbine blades that ringed its edge, and the resulting thrust was
ducted out to nozzles at the wing's periphery.</P>

<P>Lacking conventional tail surfaces, the Avrocar was expected from the
outset to be unstable. The designers devised an ingenious but complex mechanism
to automatically feed corrections back into the control system, using the
central fan as a gyroscopic reference. In essence, it strove to mimic the
performance of a modern computerized fly-by-wire system by purely mechanical
means.</P>

<P>But instability still proved to be the Avrocar's undoing. In test flights,
it hovered reasonably well close to the ground, but at 5 or 6ft. it developed
a violent &quot;hubcapping&quot; wobble and had to be tethered for its
own protection. Wind tunnel tests showed the control system couldn't hold
it steady in forward flight either, and speeds greater than 35 mph were
never attempted. In December of 1961, with $10 million spent, the project
was abandoned.</P>

<P>&quot;It was a very ingenious idea, but it was just way too early,&quot;
says Dan Murray, who managed the program for the Air Force. Murray now
believes that helicopters and other specialized craft have taken over the
roles for which the Avrocar was planned. &quot;I'm sure you could build
a flying saucer today,&quot; he says. &quot;The question is, why?&quot;</P>

<P>Saucers today</P>

<P>Yet the saucer lives on. Sikorsky Aircraft has been testing a 6-ft.-dia.
discshaped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called the Cypher since 1988.
In many respects, it is the robotic heir to the Avrocar, with maneuverability
that lets it lurk around terrain features as its carriers out reconnaissance.
Then there's a series of saucers build by Moller International, whose founder,
Paul Moller, drew lessons from the Avrocar. His latest, the one man, 8
engine M200X, flew stably and demonstrated technologies for a proposed
flying car. In the lighter-that-air arena, the Russians looked to a shape
strikingly reminiscent of Lockheed's 1953 patent to make their huge Thermoplane
cargo blimps stable at low speeds and efficient at high speeds.</P>

<P>But what about high-performance saucers, saucers like those the Air
Force feared 47 years ago? Was Weapon System 606A and the failed Avrocar
really the end of large-scale military saucer research?</P>

<P>Tantalizing leads suggest not. William Blake, an engineer at the Air
Force's Wright Laboratory, told us of a huge nuclear powered craft designed
by Convair in the early '60s under a Navy contract for a transoceanic transport.
He found a brief article dated June 1960, which shows a general arrangement
drawing, and describes the vehicle as 400ft. in diameter and capable of
carrying a million-pound payload. Known as the ground-effect machine, or
GEM, the concept relied on a curtain jet like ht Avrocar for lift near
the ground, but had no provision for flight at higher altitudes.</P>

<P>More recent but also more dubious is the well-publicized story of Robert
Lazar, who says he worked at a Nellis Range base even more secret than
Area 51. He says the base, called S4, consists of nine underground hangars
containing extraterrestrial saucers that the government is trying to reproduce.
But when we ran his explanation of the spacecrafts' workings by a respected
physicist, we were told it contained obvious errors. Nor does Lazar's claimed
educational background check out.</P>

<P>A more mundane scenario might warrant consideration, however. Recent
years have seen the maturation of the electronic flight controls needed
to stabilize a saucer, while stealth has brought a whole new set of parameters
to aircraft design. Although the techniques for foiling radar are complex
and largely classified, a key principle is to minimize the surfaces that
might intersect a radar beam at a right angle. What, one has to wonder
would do this better than a flying disc?</P>

<P>This question ran through my mind as I trained my telescope on Area
51. The night before, Glenn Campbell and I had been spotted by security
as we watched from another hill, and we immediately heard &quot;We just
went into condition watchdog...we have visitors on the hill&quot; over
the control-tower-frequency. Something was told not to land. Something
they didn't want us to see even from 12 miles away.</P>

<P>So tonight atop White Sides, I'm determined to lay low. The tower opens
at 4 am and with the words &quot;no condition in effect&quot; confirms
I'm undetected. At 4:30 am, a Black Hawk flying with no lights makes a
low pass, but I'm hidden in a rocky ravine. Dawn breaks. Activity at the
base picks up. In the crisp morning air, cars, trucks, even people are
visible moving among the hangars.</P>

<P>An F117-A takes to the runway, but no saucers. Still, there's a strange
exhilaration at my solitary view into this secret world. There's something
out there. And as long as they won't tell us what it is, our dreams of
flying saucers will have this place to roost.</P>

<P><A NAME="- 6"></A>- 6 -</P>

<P>MEDICAL DOCTOR PUTS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO PROVE THE HIV VIRUS DOES
NOT CAUSE AIDS.</P>

<P>If you or someone you know has tested positive for the HIV virus there
is now good news.</P>

<P>The chances you will get ill or die from AIDS are no greater that if
the test came out negative.</P>

<P>The London Times reports a major research group has recently proven
the test for the HIV virus (which is claimed to cause AIDS) is completely
invalid and &quot;riddled with false positives&quot;.</P>

<P>Malnutrition, multiple infections, malaria, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis,
having once had the &quot;flu&quot; or measles even the bodies own natural
response to anal semen all result in positive HIV/AIDS tests.</P>

<P>Now the truth is finally revealed. When a completely normal and health
person tests positive for HIV, is then put on the deadly drug AZT - they
die. Death results from the destruction of the immune system caused by
the deadly drug AZT and not by HIV.</P>

<P>I interviewed Dr. Robert E. Willner, a medical doctor who has practiced
and lectured on medicine worldwide for over 35 years. He recently stunned
Spain by inoculating himself with the blood of Pedro Tocino, an HIV positive
hemophiliac. Dr. Willner is the author of the just published blockbuster
book &quot;Deadly Deception: The Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely Do Not
Cause AIDS.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. Dr. Willner, you say in your book AIDS is the greatest fraud in medical
history. That the perpetrators of this crime are raking in billions while
innocent people are being murdered with the deadly drug AZT. Is AIDS a
scam?</P>

<P>A. No, people are indeed dying of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
or AIDS. The scam is that AIDS is not caused by HIV and AIDS is not transmitted
sexually or by any other means. The real causes of AIDS have been known
for centuries and have been listed in medical textbooks for over 60 years.
We have all been lied to and sold a bill of goods by a handful of unscrupulous,
immoral scientists that care more for money and power than for the truth
and human life itself.</P>

<P>Most of the medically supervised AIDS deaths were either caused or contributed
to by the deadly drug AZT. In many cases it was given to perfectly normal
and health individuals who were terrorized by fear from the AIDS media
blitz into taking the phony HIV test. When a percentage got positive test
results they were then given lethal doses of AZT, a drug that was shelved
over 20 years ago because it was found to be too toxic to give terminally
ill cancer patients.</P>

<P>Q. We have been told all along that all AIDS patients have the HIV virus
and that is what causes AIDS!</P>

<P>A. That is an absolute lie! The HIV/AIDS hypothesis was based on the
fact that only 40% of AIDS cases were confirmed by the Center for Disease
Control to have the antibodies to HIV and not the virus itself. In New
York and San Francisco only 7% of the AIDS victims were HIV positive. This
means that 60 to 93% of all AIDS patients that were used to create the
AIDS hypothesis were HIV negative.</P>

<P>The entire AIDS hypothesis is based upon a total lie. We were all lied
to when we were lead to believe that 100% of AIDS victims were HIV positive.</P>

<P>Q. But how could this happen?</P>

<P>A. To answer that question we must examine just exactly who created
this great lie.</P>

<P>It was none other than Dr. Robert Gallo who was investigated and found
guilty of &quot;scientific misconduct&quot;. The very same Dr. Robert Gallo
who just a few years prior to AIDS discovered what he called the HTLV retrovirus.
He claimed that HTLV caused human leukemia but failed to gain scientific
acceptance because he could not prove it.</P>

<P>Gallo likewise claimed that HTLV was sexually transmitted and had a
latent period of 40 years.</P>

<P>That theory was rejected and failed to gain Dr. Gallo acceptance into
the National Academy of Sciences. His theories on AIDS are just as fallacious
and one cannot help but see the similarities in the scenario.</P>

<P>However, this time instead of trying to prove his insane theories about
AIDS to his peers, without scientific proof, he by-passed them and went
public.</P>

<P>Then, with the help of Margaret Heckler, former head of Health and Human
Services, who was under great political pressure to come up with an answer
to AIDS, the infamous world press announcement of the discovery of the
so-called AIDS virus came about.</P>

<P>This great fraud is now responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands
of individuals world wide. It was no accident that Gallo just happened
to patent the test for HIV the day after the announcement to the world
was made. It likewise is no accident that Gallo is now a multimillionaire
because of AIDS and his fraudulent AIDS test.</P>

<P>Q. Are you saying that Dr. Gallo created AIDS?</P>

<P>A. In a manner of speaking, yes he did. By taking a number of diseases
that were killing a select group of individuals and claiming that they
all had one thing in common - the innocent retrovirus he now called HIV;
which he also claimed was sexually transmitted.</P>

<P>The truth is that these individuals were indeed dying of a variety of
diseases and they all did have one thing in common but it had nothing to
do with their sexual preference or with Gallo's harmless so called &quot;mysterious&quot;
HIV retrovirus.</P>

<P>They were all dying from specific causes that I go into great detail
explaining in my book. The information is completely documented and based
on cold, hard scientific facts-not on the phony, unproven guesswork or
the fraud-laced hypothesis that is the very foundation of Gallo's ridiculous
AIDS theory.</P>

<P>Q. How do you answer proponents of the HIV/AIDS connection when they
argue that &quot;everyone knows HIV causes AIDS&quot;?</P>

<P>A. Once &quot;everyone knew&quot; the earth was flat and the sun revolved
around it. It has been more than twelve years since the so-called &quot;discovery&quot;
of AIDS. Yet, there is still not one single reference paper that exists
in the world that proves HIV causes AIDS. In other words, no experimental
proof whatsoever has been offered to establish that the harmless retrovirus,
which cannot even be found in 50% of the individuals with AIDS, has anything
to do with it.</P>

<P>Q. Isn't it true that any disease capable of destroying a human body
is always found in vast numbers in the infected person?</P>

<P>A. Yes, of course. Yet, even the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) invented by Dr. Kary Mulli, Nobel Prize Laureate, which literally
makes it impossible for viruses to hide, can't find Gallo's HIV virus in
sufficient quantities to give someone the flu let alone kill them.</P>

<P>HIV is rarely found in T-cells (1 virus per 10,000 to 1,000,000 cells)
and when it is found it is doing absolutely nothing. In cases of full blown
AIDS, even in those just hours from death, the virus is extremely difficult
to find; and in 50% of the cases it cannot be found at all. Whenever it
is found, even in active cases of AIDS, HIV is inactive, not reproducing
and it is certainly not killing T-cells as Gallo claims.</P>

<P>Q. Then what exactly is HIV?</P>

<P>A. HIV is simply a harmless piece of dead tissue, not unlike numerous
other retroviruses that exist in our body at any given time. It is one
thousandth the size of a regular cell is harmless and is simply incapable
of doing anything that Gallo claims of it.</P>

<P>Q. Does Dr. Mullis share your contention about HIV and AIDS?</P>

<P>A. Yes he does. Dr. Mullis says: &quot;Scientists don't believe, they
have evidence...There is no such body of knowledge&quot; (with reference
to HIV as the cause of AIDS).</P>

<P>Dr. Peter Duesberg, Professor of Molecular Biology University of CA.,
Berkely and member of the National Academy of Sciences, puts it even more
distinctly. He writes &quot;HIV does not cause AIDS...The point that everyone
is missing is that all of those original papers, Gallo wrote on HIV have
been found fraudulent..&gt;The HIV hypothesis was based on those papers.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. Are there other who also support your position?</P>

<P>A. Nearly 500 of the world's top scientists are now challenging Gallo's
hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS and the list is growing daily. Every statistic,
every valid scientific observation and even the test of time now proves
Gallo wrong. It was only a matter of time until thinking scientists raised
their heads out of the sand, saw the truth and started questioning the
lies that simply did not stand up to the scrutiny of impartial scientific
reasoning and experimentation.</P>

<P>Project AIDS International charges that &quot;the dogmatic AIDS hypothesis
based on the findings of a person convicted of science fraud, is directly
or indirectly responsible for the premature deaths of hundreds of thousands
of people worldwide.&quot; PAI further goes on to say: &quot;If action
is not taken immediately against those who are directly or indirectly responsible
for these crimes against humanity through the practice of profit over life,
the drug induced AIDS deaths will most certainly reach proportions unparalleled
by any natural catastrophe in human history.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. What about Dr. Gallo's contention that HIV is a slow &quot;mysterious&quot;
and &quot;intelligent&quot; virus.</P>

<P>A. Dr. Duesberg renowned as one, if not the world's foremost retroviologist,
answers that question by saying that: &quot;Slow&quot; or &quot;lente&quot;
viruses do not exist! It is another hypothetical invention designed to
explain what is obviously nonsense. It has no basis in fact, no precedent
in science, and is contradictory to 20 years of research findings (and
I might add billions of dollars in funding). Retroviruses can only be replicated
by the host cell, and are dependent on the life-cycle of that cell. Therefore,
the virus must duplicate within hours or days in order to survive. For
over 20 years, an exhaustive investigation of retroviruses reveals that
there is no such thing as a &quot;slow virus&quot;. There is nothing biochemically
or genetically different about HIV that would give it the power to act
any differently than any other retrovirus. As Dr. Duesberg so aptly puts
it, &quot;there are no slow viruses, only slow virologists.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. Did you always know HIV was not the true cause of AIDS?</P>

<P>A. NO. I have to admit that in the beginning I too believed Gallo's
big lie. But the more I learned about retroviruses the more the AIDS hypothesis
didn't make sense.</P>

<P>Q. Surely there were a few independent scientists who tried to expose
this fraud?</P>

<P>A. There were and as an example of how their dissension was squelched
I'll quote Dr. Joesph Sonnabend, Founder, of the AIDS Medical Foundation.
His is typical of how opposition to the AIDS hypothesis was dealt with.
Dr. Sonnabend writes: &quot;...I tried to show that HTLV-1 (HIV) was not
involved in AIDS, all the journals refused to publish it.&quot; After twenty
one years of intensive research, not one clinically-relevant retrovirus
has ever been discovered, and by scientific standards HIV is no exception.
You also have to understand that when Maragaret Heckler, head of Health
and Humane Services, adopted HIV as the cause of AIDS, basically all institutions
which rely on federal government funding or grands had to go along and
cooperate or face extinction. HHS is the paymaster for all health departments
and agencies. This includes the National Institutes of Health.</P>

<P>Q. What about Kimberly Bergails, and Magic Johnson?</P>

<P>A. Kimberly Bergalis would still be alive today is she were not given
AZT. Magic Johnson is probably as healthy today as he ever was and will
continue to live a long and happy life so long as he does not take AZT
or any other deadly drug.</P>

<P>Q. Why did you inoculate yourself with the blood of an HIV positive
hemophiliac?</P>

<P>A. Because I can no longer stand by and watch the profession I love,
be deceitfully used to commit murder by following the Gallo HIV/AIDS' death
banner. I have vowed that if its is necessary I will repeat the process
of sticking myself with the blood of an HIV positive person on television
in every city in the world until this genocide stops.</P>

<P>Q. Dr. Willner in &quot;Deadly Deception&quot; you say AZT is one of
the chief causes of AIDS, can you elaborate further for our readers?</P>

<P>A. Yes, and again I will begin by quoting Dr. Peter Duesberg: &quot;AZT
is A Random Killer Of Infected And Non Infected Cells. AZT cannot discriminate
among them. It kills T-cells; B-cells; red cells, it kills all cells. AZT
is a chain terminator of DNA synthesis of all cells-no exceptions. It wipes
out everything. In the long run it can only lead to death of the organism-and
the cemetery. AZT is a certain killer! Who will be responsible for the
death of patients (some 200,000 now being treated with AZT and countless
thousands who have already died from it in the past decade) that results
from AZT therapy - pharmacological homicide?&quot;</P>

<P>The makers of AZT claim that &quot;it increases the quality of life.&quot;
Yet, all one needs do is read the package insert that comes along with
AZT and you will learn the truth.</P>

<P>The side effects of AZT as listed on its own package inserts are: Cancer
(lymphomas), Hepatitis, Dementia, Mania (madness, frenzy), Seizures (epileptic),
Anxiety, Anemia, Leukopenia, (standard laboratory evidence of immune suppression),
Impotence, Severe Nausea, Chest Pain, Insomnia, Ataxia (loss of balance),
Depression, Muscle Atrophy (wasting) and this is only half of the death
sentence list of side effects that AZT causes. Does this sound like AZT
adds to the quality of life to you or does it sound like what it really
is-AIDS!</P>

<P>Q. Are there other causes of AIDS?</P>

<P>A. Yes, there are and I explain each and every known cause of AIDS in
great detail in my book, and may I add, not one of them is sexually transmitted
or HIV related.</P>

<P>Q. What can a person suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency do?</P>

<P>A. There are actually many things a person with AIDS can do if there
is enough time and in most cases there is. The first and most important
thing is to get off any type of immune suppressive drug whether it be recreational,
prescription or over the counter immediately. Secondly, don't be conned
into taking AZT or any other last minuet, last chance at life. Thirdly,
stop believing the lie that you are going to die. Finally get and read
a copy of my book &quot;Deadly Deception&quot; as soon as possible. It
contains the information you need to strengthen your immune system. Follow
what it tells you and you will probably be OK.</P>

<P>This concluded my interview with Dr. WIllner. I must admit that before
I read &quot;Deadly Deception&quot;: The Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely
Do Not Cause AIDS, I too was skeptical. I believed what everyone else believed
that HIV caused AIDS, that HIV is sexually transmitted, that if you have
HIV you will eventually die of AIDS.</P>

<P>In &quot;Deadly Deception&quot; Dr. Willner proves the AIDS hypothesis
is totally fraudulent. Its perpetrators are guilty of criminal fraud and
murder.</P>

<P>The HIV virus does not and could not possible cause AIDS or any serious
disease for that matter.</P>

<P>AIDS is not transmitted sexually nor is it contagious by any method!</P>

<P>Backed by scientific and factual proof you will learn the truth:</P>

<P>What the real causes of AIDS are and how to totally avoid them.</P>

<P>How the HIV test can be positive because of having a simple &quot;Flu&quot;
vaccination, the measles or many other common infections!</P>

<P>Why AIDS is not an epidemic but a total myth based on false projections
disproved by time and the statistics.</P>

<P>In the United States, more people die each year overdosing on sleeping
pills than die from AIDS!</P>

<P>Why the homosexual community erroneously became identified as AIDS carriers.</P>

<P>Why AIDS is a syndrome transmittable disease.</P>

<P>Why 25 to 30 diseases were, for the first time in recorded history,
lumped together under a new name (AIDS) to give the appearance of an epidemic!</P>

<P>Acquired Immune Deficiency is not new; its cause have been known and
written about in medical books for almost seventy years.</P>

<P>On October 3, 1993, the London Times headline read, &quot;African Aids
'a myth'&quot;. Inside, across two pages, the headline screamed, &quot;The
Plague That Never Was&quot;, yet this story which exposes the AIDS myth
in Africa has not even been mentioned in the mainstream U.S. press...Why?</P>

<P>More than 500 of the world's leading scientists have challenged the
AIDS hypothesis - they are being silenced, slandered and ignored...Why?</P>

<P>The Answers are all in &quot;Deadly Deception&quot;, the nearly 300
page hard cover book!</P>

<P>&quot;Deadly Deception&quot; blows the lid off the entire AIDS fraud.
It names those responsible. It takes every argument you have ever heard
about the relationship between HIV, sex and AIDS and tears them to shreds
by exposing the lies to the bright light of truth.</P>

<P>Dr. Willner writes in clear, easy to understand language that is both
entertaining and enlightening. You won't be able to put this book down.
After you read it you will never fear AIDS again, your eyes however, will
forever be opened to how easy it is for us all to be duped by half truths,
lies, prejudice, fear and by unscrupulous, power and money hungry people
who think they can literally get away with murder in the name of science.</P>

<P>As a closing note; two AIDS researchers in Europe have already been
found guilty of fraud.</P>

<P>An independent study has proven AZT to be 1000 times more toxic to human
cells than was originally claimed.</P>

<P>There is currently a class action suite in England against the makers
of AZT by the families of its victims.</P>

<P>I URGE each and everyone of you to get a copy of Dr. Willner's new book:

Cause AIDS.</P>

<P>TOTAL Surveillance : Your Life On A Chip</P>

<P>From Mondo 2000 #13</P>

<P>By Charles Ostman</P>

<P>Imagine a world in which every aspect of your life, past and present,
is encrypted on a personal ID card and stored on a nationwide data base.
Where virtually all communications media-soon to be 100% digital-are automatically
monitored by computerized phone taps and satellites from control centers
thousands of miles away. Where self-training neural net and artificial
intelligence data search systems scan for undesirable lifestyles and target
you for automatic monitoring.</P>

<P>Personal privacy was once considered the most sacred of our constitutional
rights; agencies were severely limited by law. All that's about to change
drastically thanks to a deadly combination of extremely sophisticated surveillance
technology, ubiquitous digital information collection, and centralized
interagency data exchange.</P>

<P>Until recently the &quot;supersecret&quot; National Reconnaissance Organization
did not exist-even though it has the largest budget of any intelligence
agency. They are responsible for the design, development and procurement
of all US reconnaissance satellites and their continued management once
in orbit. Recently photos have surfaced in the press of its huge new complex
being completed in Chantilly, Virginia. (Senator John Warner-Liz Taylor's
ex-has described the one million square foot complex as a &quot;Taj Mahal.&quot;)
The NRO is eagerly implementing such technologies as ultra-high storage
capacity holographic films (allowing huge amounts of personal information
to be present on your ID card) and self-training artificial intelligence
software that tracks your personal data without human intervention. A new
era of ubiquitous surveillance is dawning.</P>

<P>A struggling military-industrial complex searching for new markets for
their technologies has merged forces with a government obsessed with ever
tighter control over the activities of the general public. Congresswoman
Barbara Jordan has proposed a &quot;National Employment Verification Card&quot;
that will be required for all employment in the U.S. The card will, of
course, have a magnetic data strip, and altering or counterfeiting the
card will be a federal felony offense.</P>

<P>There is a dedicated and aggressive effort underway to chart various
genetic features as part of one's personal information set. The fed's goal
is to have the ability to screen individuals for everything from behavioral
characteristics to sexual orientation, based on genetic information embedded
in your personal (and required) National ID card.</P>

<P>Biometric signature technologies have been developing apace. There is
even a technique available to translate human DNA into bar codes for efficient
digital transmission between agencies.</P>

<P>Are these science fiction story lines or the ravings of a paranoid lunatic?
I wish they were. As a former research engineer at Lawrence Livermore Labs
and other government labs, I watched some of these mad schemes being hatched.
This technology is on the street today or about to leave the labs and believe
me, it goes way beyond Orwell's worst nightmares. Listen up and hunker
down.</P>

<P>A fundamental shift in the legal definition of personal privacy is occurring
right now. A court-issued warant used to be a universal requirement for
personal surveillance, such as phone tapping, observing physical papers,
and probing financial or medical records. Now, in this new age of AI-driven
monitoring and data tracking systems, there are no pesky people in the
loop.</P>

<P>A computer doesn't need to seek a court warrant to monitor every aspect
of your private life. A self-training automated surveillance system doesn't
need permission to observe your movements or communications.</P>

<P>Total data tracking is already commonplace for financial institutions
and private security operations. Tomorrow, it will be commonplace for all
of us. The technical elements of a massive surveillance engine are in place.
It's just a matter of turning the key to fire it up. Let's examine these
elements and why you should be concerned.</P>

<P>Universal Encryption Chip</P>

<P>It sounds logical. The feds want to preserve privacy, so their story
goes, so they've announced that an encryption chip will go into all phones
and computers that they buy. But what do they really want in the long run?</P>

<P>How about a government-issue encryption chip in all personal computers
and communication devices? That way, the feds can deal with drug smugglers,
terrorists, kiddie porn merchants, and other miscreants who use encoded
messages.</P>

<P>Of course, they'd have to prevent tampering with the chip. In fact,
the technology to do just that has already been developed at Sandia National
Laboratory. Scientists there have developed an optical sensor that uses
a powdered silicon optical absorption layer in an optical waveguide embedded
in a chip. A micro photodetector detects even the slightest intrusion into
the chip package by measuring a slight change in the photonic conduction
through the waveguide. It can then send an alert via modem to a central
monitoring system to notify an interested party that the device has been
tampered with. Sandia is also developing a microchemical intrusion detector
that would be sensitive to the chemical signature of human fingertips.</P>

<P>Is this all part of some master plan, or what?</P>

<P>In fact, in the near future, all encryption hardware and software will
be subject to federal registration/authorization. Possession of unauthorized
encryption/decryption capability will be punishable as a federal felony.
In other words, if it doesn't have a handy back door for NSA snoops, it
ain't legal.</P>

<P>We can further speculate that the feds will embed chips in all equipment
sold for use in data transmission, digital phone calls and all other frequencies.
Note: all new phone systems wired and wireless will be digital in the next
three years.</P>

<P>Intelligent Video</P>

<P>Nor would you know what's watching you. Security cameras are becoming
standard in corporate and government facilities. They may soon even be
required. Why? Ostensibly because they want to recover loses in case of
theft, keep insurance premiums down, monitor petulant employees and keep
intruders out.</P>

<P>But the new genre of video cameras now coming out of the labs do a lot
more than that. They're intelligent. They can recognize faces, motion,
and other interesting characteristics. In fact, they behave a lot like
a human eye, with intelligent preprocessor abilities.</P>

<P>Intelligent cameras are needed because a security guard or cop can't
monitor the dozens or hundreds of video cameras in a large facility (or
dozens of satellite video surveillance channels). Intelligent cameras use
artificial intelligence-based object and motion recognition. They scan
for what a trained security guard looks for: certain motions, clothing,
faces; the presence of people in off-limits places. Instead of watching
100 cameras, only a few at any time send pictures. A single guard or a
computer can deal with that.</P>

<P>In face, a steady data stream from multiple intelligent cameras can
be uploaded to computerized monitoring facilities anywhere, coupled with
other automated observation systems.</P>

<P>The next big thing in intelligent cameras will be &quot;contentaddressable&quot;
imagery. That means they'll automatically detect the content of sophisticated
patterns, like a specific person's face by matching it against a digital
&quot;wanted&quot; poster, say. New software that can even run on chap
personal computers makes that possible. MatchMaker from Iterated Systems
(Norcross, GA), for example, uses a fractal algorithm that converts image
data into mathematical form, automatically recognizing and categorizing
realtime &quot;targets&quot; untouched by human hands and tied into a centralized
monitoring facility!</P>

<P>A related technology called focal plane array sensors (FPA) discriminates
objects at just about any distance. FPA makes it possible to use neuromorphic
sensors, modeled biologically on the human eye, which are built into a
camera to recognize a person or object by &quot;associative cognition.&quot;</P>

<P>CArver Mead at Cal Tech has designed a broad-spectrum &quot;human-eye&quot;
sensor using FPAs and 3D artificial neural network processors. To prove
the viability of such concepts, Raytheon, under contract with the Guided
Interceptor Branch of the Air Force at Elgin AFB, has developed &quot;smart
eyes&quot; using FPAs for recognizing objects in flight, thus relieving
the pilot of visual target recognition tasks while in a high-pressure combat
situation.</P>

<P>This technology is inexpensive, easily reproducible, and will be part
of standard equipment for fully automated, on-site visual and infrared
surveillance in the near future.</P>

<P>Langley Research Center (Hampton, VA) in conjunction with Telerobotics
International (Knoxville, TN) is taking a step further. They're developing
an advanced surveillance camera system that's even more intelligent: it
uses self aiming and analyzes motion or other parameters. A fisheye spherical
lens views a very wide field of vision while a self-contained image processing
subsystem tracks several moving targets at once in real time. Video for
suspect targets can be transmitted in real time to a security center.</P>

<P>These smart cameras are also getting incredibly tiny and low cost. The
Imputer from VLSI Vision Ltd. (Edinburgh, Scotland) is a credit card-sized
device that fits in the palm of your hand. It consists of a complete CCD
video camera mounted on a circuit board plus an on-board DSP (digital signal
processing) coprocessor for realtime image enhancement, feature detection,
correlation and convolution (for fast analysis on the fly), and even an
optional library of pre-stored feature data so that the camera can independently
recognize a specific face or other security-oriented data. It can also
download its captured visual data via telephone line to a data collection
and processing facility.</P>

<P>With everything on a few chips, intelligent cameras can now be mass-manufactured
like pocket radios. No need for security personnel-they can be linked to
a computer surveillance monitoring and data base system.</P>

<P>This is where it gets really insidious. When the technology becomes
so cheap, tiny, and powerful, and no guards are needed, they can sprinkle
these things around like corn chips...secretly putting them on every street
corner, in every waiting room, office, wherever.</P>

<P>Keep smiling, because you'll never know when you're on candid camera.
And hey, relax, they've just captured your surfaces.</P>

<P>BIOMETRICS</P>

<P>Where it really starts to get hairy is when we enter the brave new world
of Biometrics. Biometrics is the process of gathering biological information
and converting it into data that can be uploaded into automated systems
for identifying you.</P>

<P>They can use your fingerprint (via automated fingerprint identification
systems), retinal scan, voice or other personal signatures. Miros of Wellesley,
MA has recently introduced a system called Face-to-Face, using neural nets,
that is particularly insidious. Unlike fingerprint or palm recognition,
it identifies your face &quot;non-intrusively&quot; (that's technospeak
for surreptitiously) with 99% recognition. It can even identify your face
when you add glasses or change your hairstyle.</P>

<P>There are biometric service bureaus like TRW that provide immediate
access to personal dossier information to prisons, banks, military bases,
research facilities, pharmaceutical companies, etc. The client simply installs
a retinal scanner or other device and transmits your image to a service
bureau, which sends back your complete dossier. This is big business for
these service bureaus. We're talking billions in government and corporate
contracts.</P>

<P>What's next? We can expect intelligent scanning systems will be installed
in supermarket checkout lines, lobbies, airports, stores, ATM sites, and
so on in the near future. Known shoplifters will be tracked from the time
they walk into the store. There'll be a cordon sanitaire around playgrounds
and day care centers.</P>

<P>What happens when the FBI ties its fingerprint verification system at
its National Criminal Information Center, with its library of over 250,000
fingerprints, into the national health care card system, employment ID
card, IRS, and just about everything else?</P>

<P>If the FBI has you listed as a radical or some other species of undesirable,
will they be automatically notified whenever you appear at a doctor's office?
Every time you use an ATM? What about when you buy a naughty magazine or
subscribe to a &quot;politically incorrect&quot; publication? Where does
this stuff stop?</P>

<P>Satellite Surveillance</P>

<P>It doesn't. You image may be up for sale right now. Ten-meter resolution
satellite images of those strange weeds in your back yard are available
to any buyer from the French company SPOT Image of Reston, Virginia.</P>

<P>Even sharper images are available. Spy satellite images at two meters
resolution are now available from World Map. About 30 other countries-particularly
Germany, Israel, and China-are planning to launch satellite surveillance
systems.</P>

<P>Producers of satellite and surveillance equipment and large database
processing services like TRW have huge financial stakes in this $8 billion
market. They've put massive pressure on the CIA and DoD to loosen up control
of satellite surveillance technology. Three of them-Lockheed, Orbital Sciences(which
is launching Eyeglass), and World View-are launching satellites with resolutions
from one to three meters by 1997.</P>

<P>Another recently-formed U.S. company, Teledesic, is planning a vast
$9 billion global communication system using 840 geosynchronous orbit satellites,
scheduled for 2001. There would be no single area on the planet that could
not be &quot;seen&quot; on demand, and more importantly, virtually all
digital communications could be linked through this universal transponder
system.</P>

<P>Suddenly we're just one step from a universal monitoring system. The
satellites could conceivably serve as platforms for multi-spectra, on-demand,
visual and IR surveillance of any coordinate on the planetary surface.
Note: both founders of Teledesic, Bill Gates and Craig McCaw, declined
to be interviewed by MONDO on this topic.</P>

<P>ROBOT SPIES</P>

<P>Unmanned robotic devices (airborne and land-based) are now here that
can observe an individual or dwelling day or night from a distance. They
can also monitor communications (using RF signatures) over a broad spectrum
of frequencies. They can be activated from a distant control center thousands
of miles away from the target; and surveillance data can be collected and
examined in real time via satellite link.</P>

<P>For example, there's the SR2 Security Robot System from Cybermotion
Inc. of Roanoke, Virginia. Designed to &quot;replace human security personnel,&quot;
the SR2 patrols a region of up 15 square miles for 12 hour shifts (between
charges), using ultrasonic, optical, and infrared sensors plus onboard
&quot;fuzzy logic&quot; to navigate around complex obstacles and interpret
data. An operator at a remote site controls and interacts with a group
of these robots via bidirectional RF data links.</P>

<P>There's also NASA's High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft.
HALE can stay airborne for days at a time, carrying CCD optical and infrared
camera systems. These lightweight stealth aircraft are flown by remote
control, using satellite data links to an operational command center that
can be thousands of miles away. Perfect for kamikaze-style strikes.</P>

<P>And the U.S. Navy is soliciting proposals to develop a robotic, flyable
platform for optical and infrared surveillance, designed for &quot;riot
control, border surveillance, and personnel detection.&quot;</P>

<P>A fuzzy logic based RF communications signal/signature analysis system
has been solicited by the U.S. Navy. It will be able to recognize the content
of any transmitted signal from anywhere, regardless of spread spectrum,
encryption, or other electronic signal countermeasures. Commercial applications
cited in the solicitation are &quot;law enforcement, surveillance, drug
interdiction, illegal immigrant control, etc.&quot;</P>

<P>Real time monitoring by these robotic devices can be remotely activated
from anywhere. No search warrants, no court authorizations.</P>

<P>MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTERS AND OPTICAL STORAGE</P>

<P>All these surveillance systems generate massive amounts of information.
Until recently this would have been impractical for millions of people.</P>

<P>Currently, massive optical data storage technologies coupled with extremely
powerful, massively parallel processing computers are capable of very high-volume
data storage and very high-speed data analysis.</P>

<P>The Department of Commerce is financing a joint project with Tamarack
Storage Devices to develop a photorefractive holographic data storage system
capable of handling hundreds of terabytes (that's 10^12thpower bytes) of
data for extremely large database processing operations. This is exactly
the type of information storage/processing capability required for a nationwide
population monitoring system. Thinking Machines Inc., of Cambridge, MA
has recently announced a massively parallel processing supercomputer, the
CM-5, specifically designed for extremely huge data base processing applications.
It can access an astonishing 3.2 terabytes of data with a bandwidth of
up to 4.2 gigabytes per second, distributed over a network of 16,000 processing
nodes that can be located anywhere.</P>

<P>A handful of these systems can maintain an up-to-date population monitoring/data
processing system for the entire country.</P>

<P>What do you think is going to be in that secret $350 million National
Reconnaissance Organization (NRO) building in CHantilly, VA? Hint: They're
not watching Russia any more.</P>

<P>NEURAL NETS AND AI</P>

<P>Of course, all these operations normally require huge staffs of trained
experts. That's where neural nets and artificial intelligence come in.
Neural net processing systems can search for &quot;behavioral tendencies&quot;
within a database and automatically flag certain individuals for surveillance
and &quot;attention&quot; from interested enforcement agencies, employers,
political researchers, etc. This is a rung up from knowbots and gobots.</P>

<P>A good example is the ominous Origin system (the U.S. base is Tampa,
FL), a worldwide realtime, intelligent vision processing and networking
database system designed for &quot;intelligent security database monitoring
and observation&quot; for law enforcement and government agencies. It used
Iterated Systems' Matchmaker software running on a global computer network.
A surveillance camera or biometric sensor anywhere can feed signals into
the network and get back a name of the person in seconds.</P>

<P>HNC's (San Diego, CA) DataBase Mining Workstation is a dedicated neural
network processing engine designed to look for &quot;interesting&quot;
data sets on its own. The user &quot;trains&quot; the system for topics
or features of interest. Once effectively trained, the system automatically
tracks anything (or anyone) that gets its attention and draws its own conclusions.</P>

<P>HNC also sells the Falcon neural net credit card &quot;fraud and abuse&quot;
detection system. It automatically &quot;learns&quot; about unusual spending
habits and related behavioral feature sets. Clients for this system include
AT&amp;T, Colonial National Bank, Eurocard Netherlands, First USA Bank,
Household Credit Services, and Wells Fargo Bank. HNC is also working on
credit risk evaluation, bankruptcy potential, and other forms of financial
activity pattern recognition.</P>

<P>Again, no need for pesky humans who can be held accountable for violation
of privacy. &quot;The machine did it!&quot; Once this becomes routine,
current legally-defined barriers to privacy disappear totally.</P>

<P>AUTOMATED VOICE RECOGNITION</P>

<P>In the good old days, they had to attach electronic clips to your phone
and get court authorization. Not so today.</P>

<P>Let's say you're on a list somewhere based on your politics, reading,
or drug, or sexual habits. Zap: you're suddenly on a priority list for
surveillance. You make a call and your voice matches the profile. The system
starts to listen in to your vocal communications in real time. The voice
data can then be digitized, stored, and added to your surveillance dossier
by the computer.</P>

<P>If you've seen the movie Clear and Present Danger, you know how easily
intelligence agencies monitor cellular phone calls, satellite phone calls,
and anything else that's broadcast. (It's actually easy for anyone to monitor
cellular calls with a scanner covering 870 to 896 MHz or a UHF TV receiver
tuned to channels 80 to 83 and a good UHF antenna.) Then they digitize
speech signals and convert them into text data, which can then be processed
to search for specific words or phrases.</P>

<P>All this will be a lot easier when the telephone companies introduce
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) communications in a few years. Virtually
all communications, including data transmission and business and personal
phone calls will be routed through the same universal communication channel,
making the job of listening in much easier.</P>

<P>Dialogic Corp. (Parsippany, NJ) is developing &quot;second generation&quot;
modular telephone call-processing and automated speech recognition system
hardware and software. Uses include online automatic keyword and phrase
recognition. That is, any word or word combination that may be &quot;interesting&quot;
to an automated listening system can cue automated storage of an entire
conversation for further analysis.</P>

<P>The Sprint voice-activated phone card is already in use. But several
corporations including TRW have already taken it a step further. They can
analyze and store voice signatures for every telephone caller in the country
for a much larger market: voice recognition for phone credit card verification
and voice-triggered ID security systems. Essentially, you'll be forced
to use voice ID or no credit or access. It's a simple matter to adapt this
kind of technology for a national tracking system.</P>

<P>The U.S. Navy wants to take it a step further. As evidenced by its recent
FY 94 &quot;Global Surveillance and Communications&quot; technology solicitations
(as per the SBIR development funding program), they are developing a &quot;robust
signal processing of speech&quot; capability with &quot;voice communications
countermeasures and counter-countermeasures&quot; as part of a comprehensive,
speech recognition and processing system.</P>

<P>Sun Microsystems workstations include a microphone and speech recognition
chip. A recent security alert from the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon University disclosed that the workstations had been
pre-programmed with a &quot;world readable&quot; status feature. That means
any of these networked workstations could in fact serve as a remotely-monitored
microphone. A back door has already been built into this workstation. That
means anyone can activate the microphone to listen in remotely from anywhere
in the world.</P>

<P>DESKTOP NSA</P>

<P>But all this massive power is not limited to giant computer centers.
Even desktop computers are now becoming powerful enough to handle massive
amounts of intelligence information.</P>

<P>Adaptive Solutions Inc. (Beaverton, OR) sells a $7000 CNAPS/PC board
that converts a 486 or Pentium computer into a massively parallel processing
engine. The boards, each of which contains 128 processors, perform 2.56
billion multiply/accumulate operations per second. This means a 1000 times
performance improvement in pattern recognition.</P>

<P>Companies are turning these powerful new surveillance tools on their
own people too. For example, Microsoft has a secret project to monitor
all keystrokes of its personnel to &quot;improve efficiency&quot; using
neural net and artificial intelligence software. And Edify Corp. (Santa
Clara, CA) is supplying &quot;intelligent agent&quot; software to BellSouth
Communications Systems (Roanoke, VA). It will be built into BellSouth's
Electronic Workforce software. Its customers will use it for interactive
voice response and recognition, personnel and client workforce screening,
efficiency monitoring, and workflow automation.</P>

<P>PROBATION NATION</P>

<P>This is NOT another paranoid &quot;1984&quot; scenario based on some
futuristic fantasy. For the first time in history, the technology is available
to design and implement such a ubiquitous surveillance/monitoring system.
This crisis climate created by the media-particularly television &quot;news
magazines&quot;-is being used to mandate this horror.</P>

<P>The political will to do this is here and it is being touted as an acceptable
solution to such problems as crime and illegal immigrants. The general
public is not even remotely familiar with the technical details of how
such a repressive system could be implemented and won't wake up until they're
virtual prisoners in a totally automated Surveillance Society.</P>

<P>SNITCH CHIPS, SLAVE BRACELETS AND YOU</P>

<P>or</P>

<P>LEMME OFF THIS BOARDGAME</P>

<P>by Clark Matthews</P>

<P>Mondo 2000 # 13</P>

<P>Almost from the day President Clinton assumed office, it became obvious.
The secret guardians of national security and public order were fully prepared
to pervert the new generation of information technologies into a monstrously
sophisticated digitotalitarian police state.</P>

<P>The Total Surveillance State taking shape under his leadership appears
to have three broad components:</P>

<P>* Automatic spying on all public and private communications networks.</P>

<P>* Automatic &quot;profiling&quot; of all citizens by computer: gather
all available details-health, consumer habits, political activites, etc.</P>

<P>* Digital identity and social control mechanisms, in particular, Smart
Cards featuring ultra-dense integrated circuitry and trackable Clipper-chip
encryption.</P>

<P>A Smart Card is literally a computer on a credit card, complete with
large amounts of digital storage, and even potential wireless communications
capabilities. Once Smart Cards and digital cash come into wide use, there
is no doubt that this system can be designed to function with ruthless
effectiveness.</P>

<P>The information sciences-and the touted &quot;Information Superhighway&quot;-are
being perveted into a Total Surveillance State. This year, for example,
numerous federal agencies suddenly announced virtually complete plans to
restrict access to their services to Smart Cards only.</P>

<P>CLIPPER: THE &quot;SNITCH CHIP&quot;</P>

<P>Everybody needs papers in a police state. Ironically, the automated
Gestapo no longer needs to issue them. Instead computer-controlled cards
and high-speed computers will monitor special &quot;snitch-chips&quot;
built into household appliances like telephones and cable boxes. Ja Wohl!
The Automatic Gestapo.</P>

<P>Recently some press reports contended that the Clipper chip is &quot;dead.&quot;
I'll let Janet Reno answer that one (7/22/94): &quot;We are working with
industry to develop the same capability [Clipper-style surveillance] for
data networks that Clipper provides for voice networks.&quot; I would hardly
call that &quot;backing away.&quot;</P>

<P>Clipper chips and Clipper-like software snooping schemes are definitely
not dead. On the contrary, they are the very lynchpin of the automated
Gestapo-for both surveillance and personal identification.</P>

<P>President Clinton carefully avoided mentioning Clipper's planned identification
capabilities when he personally announced the chip at a splashy Rose Garden
press conference within weeks of assuming office. He claimed that the chip
was created by &quot;government scientists&quot; to &quot;ensure personal
privacy&quot; for telephone conversations.</P>

<P>Beyond the smarmy assurances, there was another tipoff that something
was peculiar with Clipper: the chip processes information with blazing
speed. It has a bandwidth of 12 megabits per second. That's fast enough
to encrypt a video signal from a small slow-scan camera-perhaps in a videophone,
or perhaps in other household appliances with high-speed communications
links. Your cable box, for instance.</P>

<P>Ever since he announced it, Clinton has deftly moved the Clipper project
around, from the NSA to the Justice Department, to the National Institute
of Science and Technology (NIST) and the Treasury Department. He is dodging
the serious questions-and growing outrage-over the suspicious secret chip.
So what did you expect of someone who didn't inhale?</P>

<P>PROJECT TESSEREA: CLIPPER SLAVE BRACELETS</P>

<P>Tesserea, classic fans, means &quot;a piece of mosaic.&quot; In ancient
Rome, tessereae were also identity tags, which were given to soldiers and
slaves. Slaves caught without them usually came to grief.</P>

<P>Today, tesserea still means the same thing at the NSA and the out-of-the-limelight
Defense Messaging Agency (DMA). For the past few years, these two secret-government
bastions have collaborated to create Tesserea devices. These are computerized
Smart Cards with large amounts of flash memory capacity, somtimes prototype
wireless communications devices-and an on-board &quot;Capstone&quot; chip.</P>

<P>Capstone is Clipper's smart brother, sometimes called &quot;Clipper
2.&quot; It is the brains of Smart Cards. Each Capstone chip has a unique
&quot;digital signature&quot; that identifies it (and its owner) to the
scanning computers of the automatic Gestapo on the communications networks.
In other words, whether you use your Tesserea card to claim disability
benefits or buy golf balls, every transaction will be duly recorded.</P>

<P>There are some interesting angles to these latter-day slave bracelets.
First of all, Tesserea cards were being tested at the DMA years ago-long
before president Clinton's Clipper announcement. Another interesting fact
is the overall code name of the Tesserea project. The project is called
&quot;Mosaic.&quot;</P>

<P>Someone has a classical education, it seems.</P>

<P>Capstone Tesserea cards are being pushed hard by practically every agency
and department of Clinton's government. The pretexts seem almost endless.
They range from tracking &quot;childhood immunizations&quot; by Donna Shalala's
Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to recommend &quot;work
permits&quot; and a &quot;digital passport&quot; created at the Immigration
&amp; Naturalization Service (INS).</P>

<P>Other pretexts include &quot;federal benefits delivery systems&quot;
proposed for the Social Security Administration and Veterans Administration,
as well as planned nationwide authorities for distributing military pensions,
food stamps, and other forms of public assistance. Then there's the infamous
&quot;Health Security Card&quot; touted as part of the biggest cat's paw
of all-&quot;Health Care Reform.&quot;</P>

<P>And lastly ther's the Postal Service's &quot;U.S. Card,&quot; proposed
as a no-bones-about-it universal identity card. A postal spokesman actually
hyped the U.S. Card as a device to replace the &quot;twenty million 'Little
Brothers'&quot; waiting in the wings, from every federal agency under Clinton's
control.</P>

<P>Each of these initiative comes complete with an oh-so-vaguely described
national distributed database. The sole exception is the U.S. Card, which
will serve as a universal identifier requried for all integrated government
databases.</P>

<P>TROUBLE ON THE LINE: THE DIGITAL TELEPHONY ACT</P>

<P>Want to start a police state? Control the telephone network. Build telephone
bugs into all new buildings. Design it so you can turn them on whenever
you like.</P>

<P>&quot;Every carrier must ensure that it's equipment allows for interception
of a communication concurrent with the transmission and provide call identifying
information to a remote government facility. Manufactures and support service
providers mustl also assist by developing equipment and software with these
capabilities. Providers have four years...to comply.&quot; -from the FBI's
proposed &quot;Digital Telephony and Privacy Improvement Act of 1994.&quot;</P>

<P>Read it and weep.</P>

<P>In the tradition of Hoover, the FBI has been flacking in Congress for
approval of its &quot;Digital Telephony and Privacy Improvement Act&quot;
of 1994. This proposed law would legalize a computerized universal surveillance
system on the digital telephone network. That's right: The automatic Gestapo.</P>

<P>From the rarified heights of the Jane Edgar Hoover Headquarters Building,
FBI Director Freeh and Janet Reno are even offering to sweeten the deal.
They'll pay telephone companies $500 Million (in tax payers dollars) to
build the automatic Gestapo into their equipment. As if they had a choice.</P>

<P>Then telephone subscribers will get stuck with the monthly bill for
maintaining and expanding the system. And what a system.</P>

<P>The FBI's prototype systems-&quot;Smart Boxes&quot; developed by Bell
South-are secret, unaccountable and virtually undetectable. They work by
remote control and can automatically bug your house through the microphones
in your telephones.</P>

<P>According to the specifications for Bell South's Smart Boxes, just one
of these wonderful gadgets can snoop on an entire residential neighborhood.
The box offers America's secret police several different levels of surveillance,
depending on the amount of interest in the subject.</P>

<P>At the basic level the device is programmed to record all the phone
numbers the victim calls, and the phone numbers of everyone who calls the
victim. 64 kilobytes of storage is provided to store the compressed telephone
data. Every day, the box automatically sends this compressed log of phone
numbers to its master computer for storage and profiling.</P>

<P>For industrial-strength surveillance, Smart Boxes can be programmed
to record everything that passes over the digital phone line. Conversations,
faxes, data calls and video. The box has its own high-speed line for sending
these interceptions to its master computer-possibly thousands of miles
away.</P>

<P>Another program option lets the automatic Gestapo give especially interesting
victims the full Congressional treatment: continuous, 24-hour monitoring
of every room with a telephone.</P>

<P>WITH ENOUGH SHOEBOXES...</P>

<P>The technical lynchpin of this leviathan is the new generation of blindingly
powerful computers. These feature parallel procesor architectures and utilize
self-teaching AI software. They're already being deployed on the nation's
business and financial networks. These systems can automatically snoop
on financial transactions, create &quot;profiles&quot; of the people who
make the transactions, and store the information for later analysis.</P>

<P>In particular, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part
of the Treasury Department headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, has created
a system with enough computing power to scan all of the nation's interbank
networks and profile money movements, cash transactions, and credit card
purchases.</P>

<P>FinCEN's scanning and profiling operation uses high-powered mainframe-type
computers and works in near-real-time. It is also reported to rely on pattern-matching
AI software to identify neighborhoods-or people-with large amounts of cash
or other tangible assets. Pretty impressive.</P>

<P>Not long after Hitler gained power in Germany, his government started
gathering information on &quot;undesirables.&quot; The Nazis were so bend
on finding undesirables that they didn't stop at their own borders. They
recruited collaborators in other countries who contributed their undesirables
to the cause.</P>

<P>Within 10 yeras, these undesirables were being rounded up througout
Europe. In France, Holland, Poland, Hungary, Aurtria-wherever the Nazis
went, they were prepared with the names of their soon-to-be-victims.</P>

<P>They arrested at least 15 million people. And they did it all with shoeboxes
full of notecards.</P>

<P>FLESH EATER</P>

<P>KILLER BACTERIA'S GRISLY BODY COUNT</P>

<P>Could This Disease Be Worse Than AIDS?</P>

<P>Taken from HIGH SOCIETY (DEC 1994) by Gary Burdick</P>

<P>When James Richter cut kis knee cleaning his garage on a Sunday morning,
he noticed a rash forming around the bandage. After all, he was a healthy
27-year-old man, an ex-Marine who'd never been sick a day in his life.</P>

<P>But the thing kept spreading. Soon, his leg was throbbing and covered
with ugly red blisters. When the skin started turning black, he let his
wife drive him to the hospital. While he was waiting in the Emergency Room,
he began feeling nauseous and dizzy. Interns at the souther California
hospital cut away the dead skin and disinfected the wound.</P>

<P>By evening, Richter was running a high fever and vomiting. Even morphine
couldn't revieve the excruciating pain. At midnight, his leg was amputated
and he was pumped full of penicillin in a desperate attempt to stop the
infection. Nothing worked. While his family and physicians looked on helplessly,
the disease tunneled beneath his skin, devouring his groin and bladder.
By morning, his left kidney had shut down and there was nothing left of
his stomach. He died at 10 a.m, less than a day after he'd cut himself
on the knee. &quot;It was right out of a science-fiction movie,&quot; said
his brother-in-law, Jim Dentoni, &quot;like some creature from outer space
ate him alive.&quot;</P>

<P>John Richter succumbed to a disease that destroys flesh like high powered
acid-and can kill within hours. In recent months, the deadly germ has swept
across the globe, leaving behind a trail of death, causing more terror
than any scourage since the Black Plague.</P>

<P>And there are more reports of this disease striking every day. Could
this plague become the next AIDS? There are more than 80 different strains
of invasive Grade A beta streptococcus, the group of bacteria that cause
the disease. One hundred million of these tiny invaders can fit on the
head of a pin. They live in the throat, nasal passages, and skind of about
10 to 20 percent o fthe population, and are passed from one person to another
during a kiss or when someone sneezes or coughs. But the bacterium cause
little or no symptoms in most of us. &quot;Exposed to the same strep germ,
one kid in a family may get off lightly with strep throat, while another
child in the same house may have a severe complication,&quot; explained
Dr. Stan Kondraki of the New York State Department of Health.</P>

<P>Group A strep played a starring role in the repeated outbreaks of rheumatic
fever that killed thousands of children each year in the first half of
this century. In recent years, less overcrowded conditions and the use
of antibiotics have ketp the disease at bay. Some physicians even called
the waning plague of rheumatic fever a &quot;vanishing disease in suburbia.&quot;</P>

<P>However, in the mid-1980s, doctors began seeing new and more lethal
kinds of strep A infections. One variety of the disease, known as toxic
shock-like syndrome (TSLS), starts as a simple cold and quickly blossoms
intoa deadly form of pneumonia. TSLS made headlines around the world several
years ago when it reportedly claimed Sesame Street Muppeteer Jim Henson.</P>

<P>The infection becomes even nastier when it invades the bloodstream.
The bacterium produce toxins that gobble up human tissue at the rate of
an inch an hour. One condition, known as necrotizing fasciitis, eats away
at flesh, while another pyomyositis, consumes muscle. Both forms cause
high fever, severe pain, low blood pressure, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patients
usually die of heart of respiratory failure when what's left of their organs
shut down. Those luck enough to survive the diesase are often horribly
disfigured and may need years of cosmetic surgery and psychiatric counseling.</P>

<P>&quot;This is much worse than syphilis ever was,&quot; insists becterial
pathogenesis expert Alice Prince of Columbia. Presbyterian Medical Center.
&quot;Even before penicillin, syphilis ate through the tissue really slowly.
It took a long time to kill you. But necrotizing fasciitis grows right
before your eyes.&quot; Chicago Registered Nurse Lois Shane calls the gangrene-like
condition &quot;the most frightening thing I've seen in over 30 years of
nursing.&quot;</P>

<P>Despite the seriousness of the disease, it escaped public attention
until last spring, when the British press began reporting a number of people
who'd been infected by a &quot;mysterious flesh-eating bug.&quot; James
Anderson, 57, of Andover, Hampshire, died within hours of being admitted
to a hospital as the bacterium chewed up his shoulder and upper arms. Gillian
Wilkinson, a 48-year-old school teacher, developed necrotizing fasciitis
after an ankle infection suddenly ulcerated. &quot;We thought she had the
flu-she was shaking and had a temperature,&quot; said her husband, Frank.
&quot;Then the flesh on her ankle went black and died. It was so rapid
it wasn't true.&quot; By cutting away large areas of dead flesh from her
stomach and groin, surgeons managed to save Roseann Millar, 41, a nurse
who became infected after undergoing a hysterctomy. She had to have five
operations and extensive plastic surgery in order to hide the scars. &quot;I
have lived through everyone's worst nightmare,&quot; she told reporters,
&quot;watching something eat my body.&quot;</P>

<P>At first, it was believed the disease only struck those patients who'd
recently had surgery, or some type of skin wound, or suffered from an immune
disorder. Doctors were baffled by the case of Terry Bowden, a healthy 34-year-old
manual laborer. Short after cooking breakfast for his family, Bowden began
to experience flu-like symptoms. A few hours later, he developed pyomyositis,
which began gnawing at the muscles in his leg. &quot;He said the pain was
like something was going to explode in his leg,&quot; recalled his wife,
Christine. Despite emergency surgery, the father of four died the next
day. &quot;He was strong as an ox, never ill,&quot; said his widow. &quot;One
moment he was fine, and then I'd lost him.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian Bounds, a young plumber from Wales, was taken to the hospital
complaining of leg pains, believing he had strained a leg muscle. He too
died suddenly of the infection, although he had no wound or previous illness.
Siad Lorraine Black, his sister, &quot;It was terrible. Brian was there
with us one day and just gone the next. The speed of this is just horrifying.&quot;
Even doctors are helpless against the diesase. Dr. David Somervell, a retired
GP, had his leg amputated after a two-month life-and-death battle with
the infection. &quot;He became seriously ill too quickly to diagnose what
was causing it,&quot; explained his wife, Margaret. &quot;How he got it
is a mystery. It just started in his leg and began spreading.&quot;</P>

<P>In the past year, the bizarre disease has also survaced in Scandinavia,
Australia, East Germany, Canada, and New Zealand, as well as in the United
States. The bacterium left a Maryland woman with out a face, and consumed
every bit of skin and muscle covering the abdominal wall of a kindergarten-age
boy from New York. Thirty infants in a California hospital were infected
with toxic strep through smallpox lesions on their skin. Three of the children
later died of necrotizing fasciitis.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, doctors in Norwalk, Connecticut, were forced to amputate
the arm of a 30-year-old man who was stricken with the disease after cutting
his elbow. In Pompano Beach, Florida, 37-year-old Steven Hillman awoke
in the middle of the night in such pain that &quot;it felt like a hot branding
iorn was put on my butt.&quot; Within hours, a small pimple on his buttocks
grew into a nasty boil and then mushroomed into a huge, blistering infection.
&quot;If I hadn't come to the hospital when I did, my doctors told me that
five hours later my wife might have found a corpse in our bed,&quot; a
grateful Hillman recalled.</P>

<P>Florence Torburg, a Long Island woman whose husband developed a monstrous
rash on his back, compared his wound to something out of Jaws. &quot;It
looks like a shark took a great bigt bite out of him.&quot; An elderly
Greenwich Village woman died in agony last May soon after being admitted
to a New York hospital. &quot;One day she was battling what seemed to be
a bad cold,&quot; said a close relative. &quot;Later that week she was
in the hospital fighting for her life. She was in so much pain. Every time
they thought they had licked it, it appeared somewhere else.&quot; A recent
study in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that 20 patients
in one hospital caught the horrifying disease after being infected by surgeons
and nurses who carried Strep A bacteria in their noses and other body cavities.</P>

<P>As reports of new cases continued to mount, terrified people on both
sides of the Atlantic rushed to emergency rooms. &quot;We must have seen
a hundred people last week who thought they were dying of necrotizing fasciitis,&quot;
remarked Dr. Miles Jenkins, a resident at one of Miami's largest public
hospitals. &quot;Most of them had insect bites, or were having bad hair
days.&quot;</P>

<P>Meanwhile, medical experts tried to reassure the public. &quot;This
is a very rare manifestation of strepococcus A, and people should know
that it is highly unlikely that a healthy individual will get sick from
this,&quot; explained microbiologist Dr. Henery Isenberg. &quot;It's not
a highly infectious disease running rampant through the United States,&quot;
insisted strep researcher Vincent Fischetti. The U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention announced that the number of cases of necrotizing
fasciitis reported during 1993, approximately 2,000, was well within normal
limits. &quot;You have twice as good a chance of dying in a car accident,&quot;
said a spokesman for the agency.</P>

<P>However, Dr. Leslie Speyer, a bacteriologist who has studied necrotizing
fasciitis, says the condition is definately on the rise and becoming more
lethal. This respected health care professional believes the medical community
is understating the danger in order to prevent public panic. &quot;How
can the Centers for Disease Control tell us there is no apparent increase
in the number of cases when Strep A is not even reportable?&quot; Speyer
asks. Dr. Speyer says the widespread use of antibiotics has created a new
strain of streptococcus Type A bacteria that produced a far more deadly
toxin. &quot;It's constantly change, learning new tricks.&quot;</P>

<P>Speyer's colleagues agree. &quot;There's definately an increase in serious
strep A infections,&quot; reports Dr. Alice Prince. Rosemary Roberts, M.D,
an offical of the Food and Drug Administration, says, &quot;We're seeing
more invasive strains of Group A strep that are making people much sicker
more quickly.&quot; Dr. Arthur Yee, of Norwalk HOspital in Connecticut,
warns that the Strep A strain &quot;could be mutating&quot; and that many
more patients might die from the debilitating disease in the near future.</P>

<P>Bowing to public pressure, the Centers for Disease Control announced
last May that it will begin tracking the infection for the first time.
The World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations, is planning
to establish a network of surveillance centers that would provide specialists
around the globe with advice on how to recognize and treat the disease.
Researchers have come up with a new test using silicon chips that enables
doctors to tell within minutes whether a patient is carrying group A streptococcus
germs.</P>

<P>But it may already be too late to stop the spread of the murderous disease.
French doctors studying an outbreak of necrotizing fasciitis in the Brussels
are recently discovered a strain of toxic strep that seem to be immune
to all forms of antibiotics.</P>

<P>There is even more to this story. Most frighteningly, Strep A isn't
the only type of bacteria that can devous flesh and msucle. &quot;There
are a number of different viruses that can cause the condition. Unfortunately
we dcon't know much about them yet,&quot; explains a worried Dr. Speyer.
&quot;You hate to sound like an alarmists. But unless we start taking this
disease seriously, we're going to end up with a world wide scourge that's
going to make the AIDS epidemic look like the common cold.&quot;</P>

<P>WATCH THAT ITCH</P>

<P>Here are a few facts about this very deadly disease. Pay attention if
you want to be around to read the next issue of UMF MAG:</P>

<P>* The elderly, and those who have recently had operations seem to be
the most likely to become infected. Also, those who already have other
illnesses, like diabetes, high blood pressure, poor circulation, or some
immune disorder, are vulnerable. However, virtually everyone is at risk.
Keep all cuts and wounds, no matter how small, clean and bandaged. Watch
for any sudden change in the size or shape of a rash or blister. Remember,
there's no way to completely guard against this kind of disease. It can
come out of nowhere. &quot;It's like being struck by lighting. There's
little you can do to avoid it,&quot; warns Dr. John Flaherty of the University
of Chicago Medical Center.</P>

<P>* The first signs of the killer bacteria include reddened and inflamed
skin, possibly with blistering, fever, severe pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.
If you have any of these symptoms, don't be macho. Hey, we're talking about
something that can chomp on your flesh here. Get to a hospital fast! Physicians
have found that nutritional support helps combat the disease. So while
you're on your way, try to eat foods high in protein and calories.</P>

<P>* When you get to the hospital, don't be shy. The interns at most emergency
rooms don't have enough experience to recognize the disease immediately.
They're not likely to admit someone with a rash and a sore throat ahead
of a stabbing victim or someone with a gunshot wound. If you think you've
been infected by flesh-eating bacteria, let the medical staff know about
it. &quot;There's nothing wrong with a patient suggesting a diagnosis,&quot;
explains Dr. Alice Prince. &quot;And if they tell you you're wrong, ask
them to explain why it's not possible.&quot; Suggest that they take a CAT
scan of the infected area to confirm the existence of the disease. &quot;They
key to treating this disease is catching it early,&quot; says respected
Dr. Colin Messing. &quot;A delay of even a few minsutes can mean the difference
between life and death.&quot;</P>
