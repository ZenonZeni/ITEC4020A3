<h1>General Energy Facts</h1>
<p>
<h2>Worldwide </h2>
World energy consumption is expected to increase 40% to 50% by the year 
2010,
and the global mix of fuels--renewables (18%), nuclear (4%), and fossil
(78%)--is projected to remain substantially the same as today; thus 
global
carbon dioxide emissions would also increase 50% to 60%.<p>

Among industrialized and developing countries, Canada consumes per capita 
the
most energy in the world, and Italy consumes the least among 
industrialized
countries.<p>

Developing countries use 30% of global energy.  Rapid population growth,
combined with economic growth, will rapidly increase that percentage in 
the
next 10 years.<p>

The World Bank estimates that investments of $1 trillion will be needed 
in this
decade and upwards of $4 trillion during the next 30 years to meet 
developing
countries' electricity needs alone.<p>

Traditional biomass fuels, such as wood, crop residues, and animal dung, 
remain
the primary energy source for more than 2 billion people.<p>
<p>
<h2>United States</h2>
In 1991, Americans spent about $1,975 per person on all energy purchases.  
This
represents about 7.7% of the U.S. gross domestic product.  For 
comparison, in
1991 Americans spent about $2,280 per capita for housing and about $2,565 
for
medical needs.<p>

Per capita, the United States ranks second in worldwide energy 
consumption
among the industrialized nations.<p>

America uses about 15 times more energy per person than does the typical
developing country.<p>

The United States spends about $440 billion annually for energy.  Energy 
costs
U.S. consumers $200 billion and U.S. manufacturers $100 billion 
annually.<p>
The U.S. industrial sector consumed 39% of the nation's energy in 
1990.<p>
In 1990, commercial buildings accounted for nearly 11% of U.S. total 
energy
consumption.<p>

Residential appliances, including heating and cooling equipment and water

heaters, consume 90% of all energy used in the U.S. residential 
sector.<p>
Today, 36% of U.S. energy is consumed in electricity generation.  By 
2010, that
will rise to 41%.<p>

The transportation sector consumed 35% of the nation's energy in 1990; 
this
sector is 97% dependent on petroleum.<p>
<p>
<h2>Fossil Fuel Use</h2>
The United States consumes about 17 million barrels of oil per day, of 
which
nearly two-thirds is used for transportation.  Oil provides more than 40% 
of
the nation's primary energy (energy in its naturally occurring form 
before
conversion to end-use forms).<p>

The United States imports more than seven million barrels of oil per 
day.<p>
Fossil fuels are depleted at a rate that is 100,000 times faster than 
they are
formed.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
A decrease of only 1% in industrial energy use would save the equivalent 
of
about 55 million barrels of oil per year, worth about $1 billion.<p>
Within 15 years, renewable energy could be generating enough electricity 
to
power 40 million homes and offset 70 days of oil imports.<p>

Natural gas supplies the equivalent of 35 million barrels of oil each 
day, and
its use is growing more rapidly than that of any other major source.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies and Initiatives</h2>
The high initial cost of active solar systems--ranging from $2,000 for 
small
water-heating systems to more than $8,000 for residential space-heating
systems--is the main reason for low sales in the United States.  Cooling
systems cost $10,000 to $20,000 for typical homes.<p>

Wind power has the potential to supply a large fraction--probably at 
least
20%--of U.S. electricity demand at an economical price.<p>

Providing power for villages in developing countries is a fast-growing 
market
for photovoltaics. The United Nations estimates that more than 2 million
villages worldwide are without electric power for water supply, 
refrigeration,
lighting, and other basic needs, and the cost of extending the utility 
grids is
prohibitive, $23,000 to $46,000 per kilometer in 1988.<p>
