DRAFT BILL WOULD GIVE FCC ROLE IN REGULATING ON-LINE SPEECH
<p>
Civil Liberties Groups Opposed
<p>
FCC could become involved for first time in efforts to keep
indecent speech off on-line services under new draft proposal for
legislation circulating in Congress.  Proposed changes would be
made in language sponsored by Sen. Exon (D-Neb.) that's included in
S-652.  Newest version further attempts to limit exposure of
children to indecent material, while providing new defenses for
on-line operators.  However, civil liberties groups charge that
attempt at compromise falls short.
<p>
New draft is aimed at information providers who transmit or
make available "any indecent comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image or other communications to any person under 18
years of age."  Additional language would provide new defenses for
on-line providers, including that they didn't have "editorial
control" over material;  however, provision wouldn't apply to
provider that gave up editorial control with knowledge that company
with control intended to violate law.
<p>
Proposal also would allow FCC to prescribe by regulation
procedures or reasonable steps to prevent transmission of indecent
communications.  According to draft bill:  "Such steps and FCC
procedures may include enabling the user to restrict or prevent
access to communications described in this section."
<p>
Jill Lesser of People for the American Way said that civil
liberties groups "are still not satisfied" with new draft and that
draft language, proposed by on-line service providers, Justice
Dept. and American Family Assn., isn't acceptable.  She said there
have been talks to try to replace Exon's language with bill
proposed by Sen Leahy (D-Vt.) calling for study of on-line
obscenity, but Exon hasn't agreed to withdraw his wording.  Draft
was put together by Exon staff after consultation with industry,
groups concerned with social issues, DoJ.  Officially,
Administration officials said new draft hadn't changed their
position as outlined in letter to Leahy in May that said Exon bill
could pose hazards for law enforcement in addition to harm to civil
liberties.  Senate is expected to take up telecommunications bill
next week after finishing work on terrorism legislation.
<p>
ACLU said in analysis of draft that new language "in its
existing or revised form, violates both free speech and privacy
rights."  It added:  "The Exon amendment cannot be 'fixed.'  It
must be rejected."  Among ACLU's objections:  (1) There's no
definition of obscenity.  Group said govt. has "chosen to stage
prosecutions" to take advantage of community standards, in case of
Tenn. postal inspector downloading material from Cal. bulletin
board.  (2) It would extend liability for obscene or indecent
communications to noncommercial providers, change that would be
"more restrictive" than original Exon bill.  (3) It would provide
new defenses for on-line operators, but ACLU said smaller system
operators probably couldn't afford court case to prove innocence. 
(4) Involvement of FCC should be eliminated:  "Giving federal
regulators the authority to determine the rules for distributing
on-line content will radically affect the freedom of cyberspace and
will have a severe direct effect and an equally severe chilling
effect on on-line speech."
<p>
Center for Democracy & Technology said bill still would be
unconstitutional because regulation of indecency has been approved
by courts only in very limited cases.  It would be impossible to
determine what's indecent, Center said, and prohibited items would
include rap music lyrics or novel Lady Chatterly's Lover, although
those would be available in other locations.  On question of FCC
involvement, Center said:  "Instead of just passing this critical
question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify both
legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and
more flexible and accessible user control techniques."
<p>
Center also said noncommercial information providers would be
put at disadvantage by preempting some state laws, but leave
libraries, schools and others subject to more regulation:  "We find
no valid public policy argument which would accord greater
protection to commercial speech than is granted to noncommercial
users of the net."
