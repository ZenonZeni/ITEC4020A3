<P><H3>EDITORIAL NOTES</H3></P>
<H3><P>Francis K. Peddle, Ph.D.<P>
<P>Director of Research</P></CENTER></H3>

<P>This is the first installment of the semi-annual newsletter of the Canadian Research Committee on Taxation (CRCT).  In recent months the CRCT has been involved in reorganizing the activities of the various Henry George groups in Canada.  The primary objective of the reorganization has been to coordinate research and administrative activities in our Ottawa office.</P> 

<P>For some time now I have been the Director of Research for the CRCT, albeit on a part-time
basis.  I hope to continue in that capacity. At the same time I am a lawyer in private practice in
Ontario as  well as a part- time lecturer in philosophy.  Exploring the relationships between the
disciplines of philosophy, economics and law has been a long-time passion of mine.  From my current vantage point here in Ottawa, I find myself ideally situated to pursue these interests as never before.  It
will also be necessary to reach out to many diverse groups - governmental, academic, commercial,  environmental - to name only a few, if the thought of Henry George is to be expected to have any
degree of resurgence as a guiding light for the systems of public finance in our country.  Our intuitive
and reflective sense of the justness of the principles espoused by Henry George must be tempered by
an acceptance of, but not a submission to, the fact that our less than civil society has managed to hornswoggle its members into the belief that George's work is an archaic, simple-minded homily to  economic salvation more befitting an agrarian epoch than the sophisticated, knowledge-driven global community of the late twentieth century.</P>

<P>The CRCT has contracted the services of a part-time administrator in a renewed attempt to maintain contacts with our dispersed membership.  We also think it is desirable to develop contacts with other research organizations.  Our administrator's name is Cheryl Murray.  She maintains hours from 10:00am to 4:30pm on weekdays and can be reached at (613) 232-1740.</P>

<P>The CRCT mailing list has been updated.  As the recipient of this package of materials you are currently on the mailing list.  If you do not wish to receive this newsletter or any other information from the CRCT, please notify us.</P>

<P>If you do wish to continue receiving the newsletter and support the objectives and work of the CRCT, then fill out the enclosed membership form on our brochure and remit $20.00 for the 1996 annual membership fee.  All contributions are greatly appreciated, but cannot be receipted for income tax purposes as we are not a registered charity.  However, contributions to the Ontario School of Economic Science are deductible and will be receipted by that organization.</P>

<H4><P>THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community of that value which is the creation of the community. It is the application of the common property to common uses.</P>

HENRY GEORGE in Progress and Poverty</H4>

<CENTER><H3>CURRENT ACTIVITIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>The CRCT has recently published two books CITIES AND GREED: Taxes, Inflation and Land Speculation and HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS: An Evaluation of the Ontario Fair Tax Commission.  Brochures and attached order forms are enclosed for both publications.</P>

<P>Organizations in Canada which promulgate the philosophy of Henry George have gone into serious decline in recent decades.  Schools of Economic Science, which conducted classes on George in such cities as Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver have long since ceased operations.  The Oscar Boelens Foundation (OBF) in Montreal and the Henry George Foundation of Canada (HGFC) in Toronto currently support the work of the CRCT in Ottawa.  Please see the chart at the back of this newsletter.  Total endowment funds are limited, but sufficient to underwrite research on a part-time basis.  They also relieve the CRCT of the ongoing effort necessary to raise funds continually for operating expenses.</P>

<P>The Peterborough Two Tier Property Tax Committee, chaired by Mal McCarthy, was quite active until Mal passed away in 1994.  Its trust funds were distributed to the CRCT and to John Fisher's Two Tier Property Tax Committee in Rodney, Ontario. Ben Sevack, Harry Payne and Leo Klag are still active in Montreal.  They serve on the Boards of the CRCT and the OBF.  Jean Smith in Toronto is an active Georgist who has generously supported CRCT activities.  She recently provided the funds to set up a world wide web site on the Internet here in Ottawa that will make available to everyone our tax research materials.  Jack Bea and Helen Nesbitt in Toronto are still associated with the HGFC and the Toronto School.</P>

<P>John Fisher is quite active in southwestern Ontario.  His two tier committee conducts ongoing tax impact studies with respect to lowering the mill rate on buildings and increasing it on land values.  John's work is especially important with respect to the treatment of farmland under a property tax regime that incorporates land value taxation as its primary fiscal objective.  Some of you may recall a letter sent out by John in August, 1995.  Several Georgists replied and followed up with a description of their activities.</P>

<P>In western Canada, Gaye and Gerry Shaw, still run the Henry George School of Economic Science in Calgary.  Wilbur Freeland is also operating the Georgist Registry.  Mary Rawson is a well known and active Georgist in Vancouver and has served on the governing board of the B.C. Assessment Authority for the past number of years.</P>

<P>There are, however, many other people besides the few mentioned herein, who are strong supporters of the philosophy of Henry George.  If you know of anyone who would wish to receive information on our activities please notify the Ottawa office and we will add them to our mailing list. </P>

<P>Our numbers are limited and widely scattered.  Nevertheless, it has been my experience that once someone becomes cognizant of the justness of George's economic reforms it becomes a permanent vision and abiding source of enthusiasm for changing our shaky systems of public finance.  A person who can articulate the advantages of land value taxation is invaluable when others haphazardly come upon the proper methods of raising public revenues.</P>

<CENTER><H3>WORLD WIDE WEB SITE ON THE INTERNET</H3></CENTER>
<P>As of March 15, 1996, the CRCT has a world wide web site on the Internet.  Our address is http://www.crctaxation.org. E-mail can be sent to raynon@fox.nstn.ca.  The information on the web site home page for the CRCT is contained in a separate insert in this package.  Henry George's likeness is the first thing you will see when the home page is accessed.  The web site will be continually updated with research data, papers and general information on Georgist activities in Canada.  If you have any research materials or papers which you think are suitable for the web site, please contact me. Our home page is not static and will undergo continuous development.  This newsletter itself is available on the Internet.</P>

<CENTER><H3>SIXTEENTH ANNUAL CGO CONFERENCE - OTTAWA</H3></CENTER>
<P>The Council of Georgist Organizations (CGO) will hold its sixteenth annual conference in Ottawa from October 11-13, 1996.  Official programs and registration forms will be mailed out in June, 1996.  If you wish to receive the conference program please contact our Ottawa office.  Many of our fellow Georgists will be attending this conference from the U.S. and elsewhere.  We are hoping for a significant showing by Canadians.  Perhaps this conference will be the catalyst for renewed interest in Georgist-inspired tax reforms in Canada.</P>

<H3><CENTER>RECENT TAX REFORM INITIATIVES</H3></CENTER>
<P>The recapture of economic rents for the public treasury within the context of current revenue generation and tax legislation is normally oblique, unconscious and fortuitous.  Tax researchers often contentedly misread the significance of their findings.  Proposed solutions, not infrequently, aggravate the distortionary effects of the tax system on the economy and add another epicycle to arcane Ptolemaic universe of public finance otherwise known as the Income Tax Act and various Assessment Acts in the provinces.</P>

<P>In January, 1996 the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) Task Force (the "Golden Task Force") produced a 269 page report that contained a substantial section on reforming the property tax (73-110).  The Report itself is very attractively presented with panoramic graphics, charts and tables as well as a CD-ROM attached to the back cover which contains the background research papers listed in the appendices.  This document provides us a tantalizing, and at times very insightful, discussion of the acute problems confronting the GTA.  Unlike many previous reports it seeks to transcend narrow specialization's in urban planning, property taxation, assessment and the intricacies of municipal finance and politics.</P>


<P>The Report, however, does not shed entirely the baggage of many similar reports which tackle the seemingly insurmountable problem of reforming the property tax system in Metro Toronto and its environs.  It comes close to stumbling into some genuine adjustments to archaic and often misguided assessment practices.  Unfortunately, the same "tax techies" who brought us the non-starters in the Report of the Ontario Fair Tax Commission, and who beguile and befog municipal politicians on a regular and well-rewarded basis, had a hand in the Golden Report.  Hence, the status quo well be more or less maintained without undue interference from common sense and basic economics.</P>

<P>The two immediate and pressing problems identified in the Report that make property tax reform imperative, especially in the GTA, are assessment appeals and inequities in property taxes paid by businesses (74).  It must not be forgotten that task forces, commissions, inquiries and the like frequently immolate themselves before they get beyond their executive summaries by creating a narrow and fragmented mandate or by having it engineered for them by political masters who have no mental image of the edifice they wish to erect.</P>


<P>The Report correctly tells us that the differences in effective property tax rates in the GTA are primarily jurisdictional and artificial.  The Report also notes that the tax rates on industrial property in the City of Toronto are relatively low (77).   Those passingly acquainted with urban land use issues will recognize that this fiscal subsidy, or more properly, subversion of municipal public finance by means of non-legislative assessment fiat, has thwarted efficient land development in conjunction with the zoning restrictions attaching to these often vacant and underutilized sites.  To call them industrial is a misnomer. They are the epitome of the dysfunctional, the atrophied, the unindustrious.</P>

<P>Assessment lag, states the Report, is the main problem in the GTA.  This has led to inequities within classes of property, between classes of property and between municipalities.  The Report proposes policy changes which will stabilize the assessment base and reduce property tax inequities.  The three areas targeted for reform are the assessment base, mill rates and non-residential education property taxes (83).  I will focus here on the assessment base, although from the standpoint of land value taxation there ought to be a differential rate on buildings and land as well as a modernization of the assessment base. </P>

<P>The Report considered unit-based and value-based assessment alternatives.  The former is based primarily on the size of the property, the latter on an estimate of the value of the property.  Unit Assessment (UA) in its pure form is unacceptable because it completely excludes location.  Unit Value Assessment (UVA) adjusts assessment valuations by factors that reflect market value, such as rental data and location. </P>

<P>Interestingly, when the Task Force studied the tax impacts of the UA and UVA options with land/floor weightings of 70/30, 50/50 and 0/100, the least regressive UA scenario was the one where land was given a weighting of 70% and the building/floor area was 30% (89-90).  The worst scenario was where all the weight was placed on the floor area (90).  The researchers in the Ministry of Finance conveniently avoided doing a land only weighting, although inconsistently they did a floor area only weighting.  Research is in the eye of the beholder, or should we say, she who chooses the option.</P>

<P>Actual Value Assessment (AVA) is a hybrid of Market Value Assessment (MVA), what the current system aspires to be, and UVA.  The Report wisely proposes to assess land and buildings separately in order to minimize the speculative component in "building values" (87).  It would be more accurate to say in the "land values" because there is normally no speculative component in buildings per se.  Current MVA practice commingles the two values and thus the ratepayer, and hence many grassroots property tax reform proposals, are confused and confusing.  The Report recognizes the unique characteristics attaching to land values, their appreciation and what happens when tax liability is placed thereon.  It is therefore recommended that land should be assessed in its highest and best use while buildings be assessed on the income stream generated in their current use.  This proposal is infinitely more sound economically than what was stated in the Report of the Ontario Fair Tax Commission.  Most Georgists know well enough that the more land is taxed, or the economic rent thereon given back to the community, the less speculation there will be in this limited resource.</P>

<P>The Report states that leaving land completely untaxed, as is sometimes proposed by ratepayer associations that have completely gone off the rails, would undermine "urban form policy objectives"(93).  It is also noted that Rental Value Assessment (RVA), which measures the value of a property only in its current use, underassesses owners who hold vacant land or who underutilize their properties, while penalizing owners who develop their land and maximize its income-generating capacity (95).  Again this is a sound proposal that has been reiterated for generations by Georgists, but who are still elated when it is held forth as an important aper‡u in an otherwise unsympathetic and non-systematic tractatus on tax policy.</P>

<P>Finally, the Report proposes that AVA be updated every year and that there be an averaging of land values over a three year period, so as to smooth out volatility in the land component of the assessment base. </P>

<P>Once again we have another tax report that has walked into a few good, albeit disconnected, proposals.  Without conceptual consistency and sound first principles no logical and meaningful conclusions can be reached.  The assessment reforms recommended by the Golden Report need to be complemented by an overall change in tax policy.  Lower the mill rate on buildings and raise it on the land value component.  At the same time, bring assessments into the post-Renaissance era and assess land and capital improvements separately, using up-to-date GIS technology.  Tax policy and assessment must work together to achieve common goals.  Recent comment on the property tax system loses sight of this in its zeal to keep the two separate.  What are these common goals?  Non-fiscal methods of land use regulation have historically shown their limitations.  It is being increasingly realized that the very design of the property tax plays a, and can play a more, significant role in lowering municipal costs, creating more efficient land use, reducing inequities in property taxation while providing more incentives for economic growth. </P>

<H3><CENTER>1996 FEDERAL BUDGET</H3></CENTER>
<P>On March 6, 1996 the Minister of Finance, Paul Martin, brought down his third budget for the current Liberal government.  As was widely expected this budget did not contain anything like the cuts in government expenditures that were characteristic of last year's budget - the major number of which are due to take effect beginning April 1st of the new fiscal year. </P>

<P>The most dramatic proposed tax change is the elimination of the deduction/inclusion system for child support as of May 1, 1997.  This proposal illustrates well the historical problem that the most difficult changes with respect to tax reform are in relation to redesigning the tax base.  The deduction/inclusion system for child and spousal support has been around for over fifty years.  It provides an annual tax subsidy to divorced couples of an estimated $300 million.  The rationale is that the children of families that have broken up have a greater need because of the inevitably reduced circumstances that follows marital breakdown.  The reason for this is that the support payer, who is usually the father or former husband, is generally in a higher tax bracket than the support recipient who is usually the mother or former wife.  The tax system therefore provides a subsidy for separated and divorced families that is not available to those whose families remain in tact. </P>

<P>Many groups successfully persuaded the government that the present system is unfair because it places a heavy tax burden on single mothers, many of whom are now lower middle income age earners.  It could also be argued that if you think the tax system should not be used for purposes of social engineering, then the deduction/inclusion system should be abolished.  Also some people may find it offensive that the system discriminates between married and divorced couples, and provides a subsidy to the latter.  Unfortunately, getting rid of the system will create its own inequities.  A widowed mother making $40,000 a year will have the full amount included in income for tax purposes, while a single mother receiving child support of $10,000 and earning $30,000 will only have the $30,000 included in income. </P>

<P>This is not an issue that can be resolved by a proportional income tax since it is fundamentally a matter of what should be included in the tax base, although proportionality would obviously reduce the subsidy inherent in the current system.  Of course, a public finance system that relied considerably less on the taxation of labour income for revenue would reduce the significance of debates such as those revolving around the taxation of child support, which are irresolvable because different parties to the debate use different criteria for judging the acceptability of the tax measure. </P>

<H3><CENTER>CASE COMMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>The Supreme Court of Canada recently released a decision that is of interest to Georgists.  In Friesen  v. The Queen, [1995] 2 C.T.C. 369 the taxpayer was narrowly successful in convincing the high Court that land bought for the purpose of resale can be categorized as "inventory" in an adventure in the nature of trade and therefore can be written down at the lower of cost or fair market value pursuant to subsection 10(1) of the Income Tax Act.  The government has proposed legislation to no longer make this possible after December 20, 1995.  Presumably, the decision will be binding for re-assessments for prior taxation years if they are not statute-barred. </P>

<P>In a three to two majority, the Court ruled that as illogical as it may be, the conservative principle of accountancy must prevail and that the matching principle need not be strictly adhered to.  In other words, land can be written down as inventory, like other stock-in-trade, as a business loss or deduction, if its fair market value falls below cost.  The asymmetry in this ruling is that the Income Tax Act does not tax unrealized profits, but it can recognize unrealized losses. </P>

<P>Georgists will be appalled at this decision.  First of all, land is not like ordinary stock-in-trade.  The ruling is frightening testimony to how a thoroughly illogical conclusion can be arrived at using the plain meaning principle of statutory interpretation.  Obliquely, the decision is judicial recognition of what has been a deceptive trend for some time - the commodification of natural resources.  This is the leveling out of the unique qualities of nature.  It is a transformation of the already created and pregiven into the re-creatable and finite commodities of human production.  This is a dangerous and very distortionary doctrine in neo-classical economics. </P>

<P>If land is inventory to be valued at the lower of cost or fair market value, then the imputed fair market value of land should be brought into the taxable income of the owner on an annual basis.  If this were the case, then economic rents would be more comprehensively captured by the Income Tax Act.  The government, however, has merely proposed a legislative change which states that the rules which apply to the valuation of inventory do not apply to "property" held as an adventure in the nature of trade.  This is mere slashing at leaves.  Essentially, it means that speculatively held land will only have a recognition of profit or loss for tax purposes on disposition.  Preventing the taxation of inert property will be one of the inevitable consequences of this recent judicial and legislative activity. </P>
