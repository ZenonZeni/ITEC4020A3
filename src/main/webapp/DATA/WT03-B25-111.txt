<H1>Why Is Drying So Hard With <BR>
Aqueous Cleaning Technology?</H1>

It's only water, so why does it take so long? . . .<P>

There are good reasons why aqueous cleaning technology does not provide
fast,
high-quality parts drying. The reasons relate to the differences in
physical
properties between water and other materials that do dry better. <P>


  Aqueous technology has become the most popular replacement technology
for parts
cleaning since the manufacture of ozone-depleting compounds (ODCs) was
banned. My
independent surveys suggest that in mid-1995 around three-fourths of
those
surveyed are converting to aqueous technology compared to two-thirds at
this time
in 1994.<P>


  Suppliers tout (correctly, in many cases) that the proper aqueous
cleaning
agent and process can improve cleaning beyond that obtained from ODCs.
End users
like it because of familiarity and perceived environmental security.
Regulators
like it for the latter reason. So users must love it after they have
converted to
it, right? Well, not necessarily so.<P>


  End users' most common concern is that parts drying is seen as poor.
That
perception is generally correct. However, parts drying can be improved
with
aqueous cleaning technology.<P>


<B>A Misconception.</B> It is not that drying water from parts is slow,
inefficient or
of poor quality; it is that drying is perceived to be slow, inefficient or
poorly
done compared to drying done with ODCs. If we did not have the benchmark
of parts
drying with CFC-113 or methyl chloroform (1,1,1 trichloroethane), we
would not be
disappointed.<P>


  Drying water from parts works as it always has worked. It has always
been
difficult to dry water from intricate sections, and evaporating water from
metal
surfaces has always left mineral deposits as cosmetic defects. It is not
that
aqueous cleaning technology has been oversold by its proponents; it is just
that
drying parts has not been mentioned because it was not an advantage of
the
technology.<P>

<B>The Perfect Drying Fluid.</B> First decide how you want to dry parts. If you look in many dictionaries for synonyms for drying, the word evaporation is often given. So, parts drying is evaporating water from part surfaces. The perfect fluid for evaporative drying would have the characteristics shown in Table I. The table suggests the type of problems that occur when trying to dry water from parts, relative to production or maintenance lines designed for use with methyl chloroform. Some problems are as follows:<P>

<UL> 
<LI>Water will not evaporate quickly from parts.
<LI>Parts will have to be heated to the boiling point of water to transfer enough heat to provide the evaporation.
<LI>Water will collect in complex sections. It will only be removed if
parts are heated to the boiling point of water to vaporize the water.
<LI>Drying loads will not be reduced as much because there will not be
much liquid
drainage from the parts.
<LI>Parts may have mineral deposits as residue after the water
evaporates.
</UL>
  
<B>How to deal with an imperfect fluid.</B> Table II shows some actions
that will enhance the drying of water. The actions are organized around the disadvantages shown in Table I.<P>

  Those who dry parts without taking these (or similar) actions will seek
to
improve parts drying by using what I call the "bigger hammer" theory. This
means
that they compensate for the natural problems of drying parts by
increasing air
flow and temperature. This adds energy costs, and means the parts will be
quite
hot at the completion of the process.<P>

  The question you have to ask about aqueous cleaning technology (or any
technology) is whether or not its advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
For
many, the advantages do outweigh the disadvantages. But for others, who
value
both high-quality cleaning and high-quality drying, other processes should
be
considered (co-solvent, chlorinated solvent, CO2).<P>

  When you choose a parts cleaning process, you must learn to live with its
virtues and faults. Some processes are better for those who value parts
drying;
some are better for those 
who highly value parts cleaning. <P>

Drying is the flaw of aqueous technology. This article has pointed out the
reasons for this situation, and offered some suggestions that have been
proven to
improve the quality and amount of time required to dry parts. <B>PF</B>

<TR>
<TD>Doesn't evaporate quickly</TD>
<TD>Consider use of another wash fluid to remove 
the aqueous cleaning agent, possibly a 
combustible organic liquid.</TD>
<TD>This liquid will evaporate more rapidly than water, 
but will add a VOC emission to the unit.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Takes lots of energy to evaporate</TD>
<TD>Decide what areas of the parts will be difficult to dry. 
Use second heater to overheat some of the air, and focus 
this air at the problem areas.</TD>
<TD>Only heat selected part areas as necessary to evaporate
water on those areas.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Films of water cling to complex surfaces</TD>
<TD>Use focused high-velocity air jets to knock 
off films of water from the complex surfaces. Can be done
by hand or automated.</TD>
<TD>Air velocity around 1,000 fps dislodges films of water,
whereas a velocity of 100 fps evaporates some of the water.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Water doesn't drain easily from surfaces</TD>
<TD>Delay drying step for 30 to 90 sec. Use time to vibrate parts
basket at 1-10 cycles/sec over rinse bath to maximize drainage.</TD>
<TD>It is much faster to "waste" 90 sec to drain the basket well, 
than to wait 5 min
to vaporize the water or 10-15 min to heat the parts hot 
enough to vaporize the water.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Water has non-volatile residue</TD>
<TD>Rinse with mineral-free (deionized) water. This can add 
significant cost.<BR><BR>
Use centrifugal dryerwhich doesn't dry parts by evaporation.</TD>
<TD>The evaporated water has no mineral residue.<P>
Water is "slung off" by centrifugal force, and the salts 
stay with the water.</TD>
