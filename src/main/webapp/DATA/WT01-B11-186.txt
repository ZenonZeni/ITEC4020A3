<B>Antlerless Deer Tag Draw:<BR>  New Telephone Application System On-Line June 17



</B>

</CENTER><P>
To help improve customer service, hunters can apply for the draw for antlerless deer validation tags by telephone, Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today.<P>

"This new 1-900 telephone application system will make the 1996 antlerless deer validation tag draw more efficient and cost-effective," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Hunters can still apply by mail, the way they always have, but the telephone system offers many advantages over the mail application system." <P>

"Results will be available faster than ever before," Mr. Hodgson added.  "Starting September 3, hunters can dial a dedicated 1-800 toll-free number to find out if they have received an antlerless deer tag."<P>

The telephone numbers are contained in a brochure that has been mailed to all deer hunters who have applied at least once for the draw during the last three years. The brochure explains in detail how to access the telephone application system and includes a worksheet to help applicants prepare all the information they will need when they make the call to the 1-900 line.  A $5.10 fee is charged for every call and it will appear on the caller's next telephone bill.<P>

The telephone application system opens at 7:00 a.m. (EDT) on June 17 and closes at midnight (EDT) on July 31. Hunters can apply from home seven days a week, 24 hours a day. The service is available in English and French, at two different numbers.<P>

"All you need is your valid hunting-version Outdoors Card number and the numbers of your first and second choice Wildlife Management Units (WMUs)"  Mr. Hodgson said.  "Another feature of the telephone system that hunters will like is that they don't need to buy a deer licence before the draw.  They will have to buy a licence if they have drawn a tag and wish to hunt an antlerless deer or an antlered deer."<P>

Hunters can access this system with a rotary-dial telephone or a touch-tone. Hunters should note that cordless phones, radio phones, cellular phones and pay phones will not work with the system.<P>
