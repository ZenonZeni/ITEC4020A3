An <I>in vitro </I>enzymatic method for the conversion of biomass-derived 
glucose to hydrogen requires relatively mild conditions and generate 
hydrogen without the immediate 
formation of waste gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CO.  Renewable 
sources of biomass include cellulose, starch and lactose.  These 
represent a vast supply of reducing power and, although themselves not 
reducing, the individual glucose molecules constituting these renewables 
(together with the galactose of lactose) can be oxidized using the enzyme 
glucose 
dehydrogenase (GDH).  This is an NADP+-requiring enzyme and this cofactor 
serves as a trap 
for the reducing equivalents from glucose.  If NADPH could be oxidized to 
yield molecular 
hydrogen, then it could be feasible that renewables could represent a 
vast source of hydrogen 
gas.  Furthermore, the cofactor NADP+ would have its own 
self-regenerating system.  Based 
upon the Z-scheme of photosynthesis and the known midpoint potential of 
the 
NADP+/NADPH couple (versus the HSE), which is -0.32 volts, this reducing 

potential is close to that required for the reduction of ferredoxin 
coupled to the 
enzyme hydrogenase.  Only two hydrogenases are known, so far, to interact 
with 
NADH or NADPH.  They are from the bacterium <I>Alcaligenes eutrophus 
</I>and 
from the Archeon <I>Pyrococcus furiosus.</I>
<P>
We have discovered a new <I>in vitro</I> pathway for the generation of 
molecular hydrogen from glucose.  The reaction is based upon the 
oxidation of 
glucose by <I>Thermoplasma acidophilum</I> GDH with the concomitant 
oxidation of 
NADPH by P. Furious hydrogenase.  It is of interest that both of these 
enzymes are from the 
separate group of microorganisms called Archaea which thrive in extreme 
environments.  This 
property clearly would be advantageous in a future bioprocess for 
hydrogen production based 
on this enzymatic reaction.  Stiochiometric yields of hydrogen were 
produced from glucose with continuous cofactor recycle.  We have also 
shown that if the substrate is cellulose or starch molecular hydrogen is 
generated if cellulase or amyloglucosidase, respectively, is included 
simultaneously in the reaction mixture.
<P>
Current studies include the optimization of conditions for hydrogen 
production from enewable 
sources of glucose as well as the immobilization of GDH and hydrogenase 
for their recovery 
and reuse.  An economic evaluation of this process will also be 
conducted.  It is of interest to 
note that the only other product of this reaction is gluconic acid, a 
high value commodity 
chemical.  Cellulose- and starch-derived glucose cost 7-8 cents/lb; solid 
glucono-8-lactone sells for $1.20/lb in aqueous solution the lactone 
hydrolyzes to gluconic acid.

<b><I>Recent Advances:</I></b>
<P>Several hydrogen generation experiments were performed to study

the effect of pH and temperature on yields and rates.  At pH 8.0,

two temperatures were tested, 40&#176;C and 50&#176;C.  At 40&#176;C

the yield was 72% and the rate was 1,959 nmoles H<sub>2</sub>/hour.  At 
50&#176;C,

the yield was lower (59%) and the rate was 3,058 nmoles 
H<sub>2</sub>/hour.

<P>

The effect of temperature at pH 7.5 was also tested.  The highest

yield, 97%, was obtained at 40&#176;C with a rate of 4,713 nmoles

H<sub>2</sub>/hour.  At 70&#176;C the highest rate (7,763 nmoles 
H<sub>2</sub>/hour)

was obtained with a yield of 66%.  The ability of the enzyme 
&#223;-galactosidase

to degrade lactose was also studied.  Lactose degradation was

measured after 2, 5, and 10 minutes by measuring the amount of

glucose generated.  The activity of the enzyme was 92.23 units/ml

at pH 7.5 and 40&#176;C.
