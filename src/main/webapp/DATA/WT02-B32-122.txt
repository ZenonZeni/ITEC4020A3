<font size=+2>RRSP  Update</font>

</center>

<blockquote>

Most Canadian taxpayers are aware of the main advantages of investing in RRSP's: 1) you deduct the contribution from income, saving tax at your marginal rate and 2) the savings are sheltered from tax inside the RRSP.<p>

The following is a list of other features about RRSP's you may not be as familiar with:<p>

<ol>

<li> The current RRSP limit is 18% of earned income from 1995 (less your PA number if you are a pension member) to a maximum of $13,500 (down from $14,500 last year).  However, you can contribute prior years unused limit on top of the above yearly number.  If you filed your 1995 tax return this information is detailed on the return assessment notice.<p>

<li> You can contribute up to your maximum limit either in your own name or your spouse's name, or both.  If married, the spouse in the higher tax bracket should purchase his or her RRSP up to the maximum, but the owner should be the spouse expected to be receiving the least amount of money from other sources.  Spouses should strive for equal income in retirement to decrease taxes and possibly increase tax credits.<p>

<li> RRSP's must now be converted to RRIF's or annuities by December 31st of the year in which you turn 69 (was 71).  There are phase in rules for individuals turning 69 or 70 this year.  Check with your advisor if you are in this situation.<p>

<li> Labour Sponsored Funds have been significantly altered and are not as attractive as last year.  The four key changes affecting potential purchases: (A) the credit has been reduced to 30%  (was 40%); (B) the special exemption for seniors or retirees has been eliminated; (C) the limit for the credit is reduced to $3,500 (was $5,000); (D) you must leave the money in the venture fund for 8 years (was 5) or you must pay the credit back.<p>

The LSIF's have less broad appeal than before but they may still make sense, especially for people with substantial unused RRSP room.  Someone in the top tax bracket can purchase a $3,500 LSIF for only $595.  It may make sense to try to save an extra $595 to add $3,500 to your RRSP portfolio, on top of what you usually plan to do.<p>

<li> Normally the maximum RRSP foreign content is 20%.  However, this can be increased if you hold qualifying small business property (SBP) inside your RRSP; defined as 3 times amount invested in SBP's to a maximum of 20%.  This is in addition to the 20% normal foreign content allowed, effectively raising the limit to 40% if you have enough SBP.  LSIF's mentioned above qualify as part of this.  Working out the arithmetic you can increase your foreign content to $40% by having 6.67% of your RRSP cost base in SBP's.  You must however, wait until the end of the fourth month after purchasing a SBP to make the change.<p>

<li> January and February can be a great time of the year to do some creative tax planning using RRSP's for income averaging.  If for example you are going to have a much lower income in 1997 (recently lost your job, etc.) you can effectively transfer income from 1996 to 1997 by purchasing RRSP's to be applied against 1996 and if the money is needed, cash it in. If done in the first two months of 1997, you are effectively moving income from 1996 to 1997.  Note that you will be using up some of your RRSP room by doing this.
