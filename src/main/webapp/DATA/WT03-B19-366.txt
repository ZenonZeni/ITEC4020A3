<H2>SPH201   Vibrations, Waves and Optics </H2><P>
<PRE>
Credit Points:          10<P>
Duration:               Second Semester.<P>
Methodology             2L, 1T and 3P per week.  <P>
Prerequisites:          SPH101 or SPH161, SPH102, SMA102<P>
Assessment:<P>
30% Practical, 55% Final Exam, 15% Continuous Assessment. 
Separate passes in the theoretical and practical components are required.<P>
Objectives:<P>
This unit is designed to advance the knowledge of the theory of vibrations 
and waves. The subject is then developed to study the theory of reflection 
and refraction of electromagnetic waves at boundaries, and the interference 
and diffraction of such waves.<P>
Description:<P>            
In the vibration section topics covered included simple harmonic motion, 
addition of two or more SHMs, free vibrations of physical systems, damped 
vibrations, forced vibrations, transient phenomena, resonances, coupled 
oscillations and normal modes.  This leads into standing waves, travelling 
waves (transverse and longitudinal) and basic EM waves.  Boundary conditions 
for waves at interfaces, refraction and reflection.  Physical optics 
including interference, Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction.  The associated 
practicals are designed to give students experience in physical optics.  
The experiments will cover damped and undamped vibrations with forcing, 
optical experiments with coherent and incoherent sources to observe and 
apply principles of diffraction and interference.  The lectures provide 
adequate knowledge for studying and analysing the experiments.<P>
