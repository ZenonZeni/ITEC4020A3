DROPPING ETHANOL INVENTORIES SIGNAL TIGHT SUPPLY, SAYS MARKETER

      Fuel ethanol stocks across the U.S. have been dropping since
September, and marketers believe that the decrease in inventories is
an indication of supply tightness throughout the system.  Ethanol
stocks at the end of November were about 2.1 million barrels,
according to the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA)
report.  This is only a  slight decrease from last year's level of 2.3
million barrels, but a substantial drop from the 4.2 million barrels
EIA reported in September 1995.
      MTBE stocks have also dropped in the last few months, but the
decrease is not as dramatic as that seen in ethanol.
      While EIA does not show a dramatic decline in ethanol production
since September, marketers say ethanol is beginning to show the signs
of a tight supply market.
      "A lot of the tightness has to do with the amount of supply that
has been removed from the market," said one ethanol marketer.  Four
ethanol plants have been closed due to poor production margins earlier
in the year and others have cut back fuel ethanol production, he said. 
"Right now we are in the middle of a heavy demand period, with the
oxygenated fuel seasons, and we are faced with a contraction of supply
but demand is still at about normal levels -- leaving a definite
tightness in the market."
      Ethanol prices continued to respond to the tightness last week,
with prices increasing 1-2 c/gal.  Gulf Coast spot ethanol traded at
$1.18/gal and export was in a range of $1.18-$1.22/gal.
      However, the current price support is expected to be short-
lived.  "We have about 30-40 days of strength left in this market,"
noted the marketer.  "The demand will begin to fall off in mid-
February, and prices should fall as well."
      After a strong showing in December, MTBE prices seemed to have
stabilized, according to traders.  Gulf Coast spot MTBE remained in a
range of 92-93 c/gal.
      Methanol prices also remained steady last week, though there was
some speculation in the market that contract list prices may increase
later in the month.

INDUSTRY GEARS UP FOR INTRODUCTION OF CARB PHASE 2 RFG
-State Tests Show No Problems in Vehicles or Off-Road Equipment-

      With less than two months until the production of CARB Phase 2
RFG is required in California, refiners, oxygenate producers and state
government officials are reporting no problems with the implementation
of the program.   Supplies of CARB RFG and the oxygenates required to
produce it are expected to be sufficient to meet demand.
      The start of the California Phase 2 RFG program will be the last
big regulatory boost for oxygenates, according to Jim Thomas, vice
president of market analysis for Bonner and Moore Associates, Inc. 
"After CARB Phase 2 begins, oxygenate demand will only grow with the
normal growth rate of gasoline -- which is usually not very large," he
said.
      MTBE will be the oxygenate of choice for most refiners producing
CARB Phase 2 RFG, predicted Thomas, though some ethanol, TAME and even
ETBE will be used to meet the increased demand for oxygenates.
      Demand for MTBE will gain an additional 40,000 b/d for the last
six months of 1996, when CARB Phase 2 RFG is required at the retail
level, said Thomas.  "If you look at the average annualized demand
increase in 1996, it is about 20,000-25,000 b/d," he said.
      Oxygenate supply should be sufficient to meet the new demand,
and non-U.S. suppliers will be aggressively seeking their share of the
new business, Thomas said.  "There is a lot of volume available that
can be moved around," he said.  "There are new plants coming online in
Korea that will help, and product is available from Brazil, Saudi
Arabia and Europe."
      Oxygenate pricing should strengthen due to the greater demand
structure and remain strong until the market adjusts to the new
demand, Thomas said.  However, large price spikes, like those
preceding the start of the federal RFG program, are unlikely since
MTBE contract pricing is now more closely tied to market factors, he
said, adding that such spikes are very difficult to predict.
      Many refiners are already beginning to stockpile MTBE for use in
CARB RFG, said Thomas.  "Some of the current strengthening in MTBE
prices is a reflection of that inventory building," he said.

State Tests Show No Vehicle or Equipment Problems

      CARB's test program, done in conjunction with some of the
state's key refiners, gave Phase 2 RFG a clean bill of health, said
CARB officials recently.  The tests involved 829 vehicles in eight
private and government fleets that drove about five million miles on
Phase 2 RFG from February through August 1995.
      "There was no meaningful difference between the frequency of
fuel-system problems in vehicles using cleaner-burning gasoline and
the pre-1996 (conventional) gasoline," CARB Chairman John Dunlap
announced.  "Cleaner-burning gasoline has been thoroughly tested and
has broad-based support within industry."
      The few problems noted were on vehicles with mileage above the
average of the fleet (95,000 miles) or vehicles that used an
especially low-aromatics fuel Texaco developed but does not intend to
sell commercially.  Separate, smaller tests on various off-road
construction vehicles, lawnmowers and farm equipment found no
performance problems, Dunlap added
      Mileage for the Phase 2 vehicles was about 1% less than Federal
RFG now sold in Southern California and 3% below conventional gasoline
sold in the state, CARB found.

SOUTH AMERICA RANKS IMPORTANT IN GLOBAL METHANOL MARKET
-Region Will Be 30% of World Trade in 1998-

      While demand growth for methanol in South America is not
expected to be great through the end of the century, growth in the
region's production capacity is projected to be one of the largest in
the world, according to experts.  "The South American region is one of
those strategic offshore locations on which increasing emphasis must
be placed if any realistic prognosis of the future direction of the
[methanol] industry is to be made," said Rampersad Motilal, divisional
manager of manufacture and marketing for the Trinidad and Tobago
Methanol Co. (TTMC).
      South America's share of world methanol export trade continues
to grow, making it even more critical to the global methanol industry. 
"At present, the South American net share of world trade is close to
2.5 million metric tons, which represents approximately 20% of the
world total," Motilal told attendees of CMAI's World Methanol
Conference in Phoenix.  "By 1998, South America will account for close
to 4.4 million metric tons of world trade -- over 30% of the world
total."
      With a capacity growth rate of more that 18% from 1989 through
1995, South America led other regions of the world in production
increases, Motilal said.  From 1995 through 1998, the region's
production capacity is expected to grow another 16.5%, he said.
      The five largest methanol-producing countries in South America
are almost all expected to see continued growth in production capacity
through the end of the century.  At the same time, demand for methanol
is not expected to keep pace, leaving more product available for
export.
      Chile and Trinidad & Tobago will be doubling or nearly doubling
their production capacity between 1995 and 1998, according to Motilal. 
Methanex is constructing a second methanol plant in Chile.  The
926,000-metric-tons-per-year plant is expected to be online late in
1996.  Trinidad & Tobago is expecting the addition of three new
production facilities -- making it the largest methanol producing
country in the region with 2.1 million metric tons per year of
capacity.  Methanex, TTMC and Saturn Methanol are all planing to build
facilities in the island nation.
      Brazil and Venezuela lead the region in methanol demand.  Most
of Brazil's demand comes from its national fuel alcohol program, while
MTBE production dominates Venezuelan demand.

Region Offers Producers Several Advantages

      Low feedstock costs are one of the advantages of methanol
production in many South American countries, said project developers. 
However, it is not the only advantage the region holds.  For example,
Trinidad & Tobago "not only offers competitive natural gas prices, but
also skilled labor, logistical advantages and duty-free access to both
Europe and U.S. markets and has the needed infrastructure available,"
said Deo van Wijk, president of Saturn Methanol Co.  Saturn announced
plans for the construction of a 2,500-metric-tons-per-day (287-
million-gallons-per-year) facility to be located in Point Lisas,
Trinidad & Tobago.  The plant is expected to be on-line by late 1997

SOUTH DAKOTA ETHANOL SUPPORTERS CONSIDER YEAR-ROUND OXYGEN

      Ethanol proponents in South Dakota are considering their options
to add a year-round oxygen requirement to the state's gasoline.  While
an exact course of action has not yet been devised, a bill may be
introduced as early as this session.
      "A year-round oxygen content has a lot of merit," said Trevor
Guthmiller, executive director of the American Coalition for Ethanol
(ACE).  "The question is, can we educate legislators on the issue in
time to pass it this year?  The lawmakers we have discussed the idea
with so far do seem positive."
      The South Dakota Corn Growers Association (SDCGA) have also
shown support for such a move, said Jane Heenen, program coordinator
for SDCGA.  The group passed a resolution to support legislation "that
would require the sale of gasoline that contains at least 2.7%
oxygenates such as ethanol" and "encourage South Dakota's governor and
legislators to take the lead in getting all PADD II states to have
similar oxygenated fuel standards."
      However, both ACE and SDCGA were quick to note that a year-round
oxygen requirement should not come at a cost of the state's other
incentives for ethanol.  "We don't want to lose the incentives we
already have in place," said Heenen, noting that almost 50% of the
state's gasoline already contains ethanol.  "This may not be the year
to proceed."
      Minnesota begins its state-wide oxygen requirement in 1997, and
Nebraska is also considering such a move.

API PETITIONS EPA TO REPEAL NOx REDUCTIONS IN PHASE II RFG

      In the first attempt to amend Federal Phase II RFG
specifications, the American Petroleum Institute (API) has filed a
petition with U.S. EPA seeking  a repeal of the agency's requirement
to reduce summertime NOx emissions.  "This move is an attempt to
formalize the complaint we have had with the NOx reduction regulations
since the rule was promulgated," said API spokesman Chris Kelley. 
      Oxygenate producers worry this move may be the first in a series
of attempts to change Phase 2 specifications, including one to remove
the oxygenate requirement.
      In the petition, API argues that NOx reduction is not a cost-
effective way to control summertime ozone and in some cases may
actually exacerbate the problem.  EPA estimates NOx reduction costs at
about $5,000/ton while API maintains that the cost is closer to
$10,000/ton. 
       "API remains convinced that EPA's estimates of gasoline
desulfurization costs and the cost-effectiveness of NOx reductions are
far too low because of flawed refinery modeling assumptions," the
petition states.  "Because consumers would be faced with the higher
costs of Phase II RFG, API's petition urges EPA to repeal the NOx
reduction requirements, which would require refiners to make
significant capital investments.
      Phase I of the federal RFG program calls for no increase in NOx
emissions from gasoline, while Phase II RFG, which takes effect in
2000, calls for a 5% to 7% reduction in NOx emissions.
      Since the 1994 promulgation of the RFG rule, EPA has granted
several state waivers from certain stationary source NOx reduction
requirements, API noted.  The foundation of these waivers stems from
the "undisputed fact that NOx reductions in many areas do not help and
may even hinder some areas in their progress toward complying with
federal ozone pollution standards," the petition said.  
      Like VOCs, NOx emissions are widely believed to be a precursor
to ozone.  However, some studies have shown that in a few cases, NOx
may actually serve to break down ozone and that NOx reductions could
work to increase urban ozone concentrations, depending on the VOC- to-
NOx ratio.  Across-the-board RFG NOx reductions are not warranted,
"especially when other, more cost-effective and more targetable
controls are available," API wrote.
      API called for a prompt rulemaking on its request to repeal the
NOx reduction requirement, asking EPA to suspend the requirement until
"a more comprehensive assessment of the NOx control strategies and an
evaluation of EPA's overall nitrogen oxides control strategy can be
performed."
      With EPA closed temporarily, there has been no recent movement
on the issue, noted a source at the National Petroleum Refiners
Association (NPRA).  "There was a meeting but it was nothing more than
a formality," said the source.  "We had discussions with EPA that the
cost and the effectiveness of a NOx control strategy has not been
properly analyzed."
      While no studies on this issue have been performed recently,
"work was done earlier in conjunction with the RFG regulations and
other work on sulfur issues," said the NPRA source.

Oxygenate Sources Call the Change A "Mistake"

      "We are concerned about any of these changes to RFG
specifications," said Douglas Durante, executive director, Clean Fuels
Development Coalition.  "To suspend NOx reduction or any other
requirement without indisputable data and a consensus of stakeholders
would be a mistake," he said.
      While agreeing that fuel science is constantly evolving, Durante
showed concern over proposed changes to RFG specifications every time
new data appears.  "There needs to be a better process for dealing
with changing data," he said.
      "At this time API is not looking for any other changes in the
Phase II RFG regulations," said Kelley.

GOVERNORS' ETHANOL COALITION SUPPORTS RFG IN ATTAINMENT AREAS

      Even as the U.S. EPA is on the verge of finalizing its rule on
RFG opt-outs, the Governors' Ethanol Coalition (GEC) is adding its
support to the growing list of those urging the agency to allow ozone
attainment areas to join the federal program.
      "Allowing ozone attainment areas to participate in the RFG
program at the request of a state governor will provide states with
another strategy with which to combat air pollution and achieve Clean
Air Act goals," wrote Govs. Ben Nelson (D-NE), Tommy Thompson (R-WI)
and Mel Carnahan (D-MO) in a Dec. 15 letter to EPA Administrator Carol
Browner.
      Allowing attainment areas to opt-in to the program is
appropriate for several reasons, according the governors:

* RFG has made a measurable contribution to air pollution control, is   
highly cost-effective and safe;
* Participation in the program may help areas in attainment avoid   
slipping into nonattainment;
* RFG would assist downwind areas to reach attainment through reduced
pollution transport; and
* Once in nonattainment, control measures required in an area would
limit industrial expansions and consumer freedom.
      "While the Clean Air Act establishes a number of mandatory
control strategies, the Act still demonstrates a clear commitment to
allowing states the flexibility to determine the appropriate mix of
measures needed to meet air quality goals," wrote the governors. 
"Voluntary participation by attainment areas in the reformulated
gasoline program is just such a measure."

THIRD QUARTER MTBE, METHANOL PRODUCTION OUTPACED 1994 RATES

      Production of both methanol and MTBE in the third quarter
outpaced the same period in 1995, says the International Trade
Commission's (ITC) Preliminary Report on U.S. Production of Selected
Synthetic Organic Chemicals.
      MTBE far outpaced increases of other key octane boosters,
growing 273,884 metric tons, or 9.46%, from third quarter 1994 rates
to 3.169 million metric tons.
      During the same period, methanol production also inched up,
rising 60,955 metric tons, or 1.69%, to 3.667 million metric tons.
      Benzene, which is limited to 1.0 vol% in RFG, fell 95.066
million liters, or 17.84% from the same time last year to 5.738
billion liters in the third quarter.  However, production of the two
other major aromatics used in gasoline blending -- toluene and
xylene -- made year-to-year gains on the strength of petrochemical
demand.  Toluene production advanced 1.21%, or 21.014 million liters,
while xylene production rose 9.23%, or 313.383 million liters.

E-95 SHOWS "SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS" IN TAILPIPE EMISSIONS, SAYS STUDY

      While E-95 surpasses premium gasoline in reducing carbon
monoxide, hydrocarbon and oxygen emissions, carbon dioxide emissions
are slightly increased, reveals a newly released study from Mankato
State University (MSU) in Minnesota.  
      The study compared the fuel efficiency, tailpipe emissions, fuel
economy, horsepower and drivability of E-95 (a blend of 95% ethanol
and 5% unleaded gasoline) to that of conventional premium unleaded
gasoline in a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder General Motors engine.
      Test results show significant reductions in tailpipe emissions,
as well as increases in fuel efficiency and horsepower with E-95 fuel,
researchers said.  However, the test vehicle's fuel economy decreased
with E-95 due to the lower energy density of ethanol.
      The study, which primarily involved laboratory testing for
horsepower and emissions, also included some road testing,
particularly for fuel economy.  It ran from January 1994 through June
1995, according to Fred Kuzel, director of the Great Lakes Regional
Biomass Energy Program, which supplied funding for the study.
Additional funding was received from MSU and the Minnesota Corn
Processors Association. 
      The vehicle used in the study was one of several test vehicles
designed and built by senior automotive engineering students at MSU. 
The fuel and ignition systems of a Recycled Automotive Design vehicle,
developed by MSU students in 1991, were modified to run on the
alternative fuels.
      For information about the study, call Associate Professor Bruce
Jones, MSU College of Science, Engineering and Technology, at (507)

PITTSBURGH COMES CLEAN BY JOINING DOE PROGRAM

      Pittsburgh has become the latest addition to the U.S. Department
of Energy's Clean Cities program, marking the second designation for
Pennsylvania.  Philadelphia earned designation in 1993.  Pittsburgh's
addition brings the program's year-end total to 43 Clean Cities
nationwide.
      Pittsburgh has more than 650 compressed natural gas (CNG)
vehicles fueling at 23 public stations in the area.  The stakeholders
involved in planning Pittsburgh's Clean Cities program expect to add
another 1,650 alternative fuel vehicles -- mostly CNG, with some
electric -- by the year 2000.  They also plan to add 40 fueling
stations.
      The program will get local support from the University of
Pittsburgh, with its Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Assistance
Program, to research the operation of NGVs.  The $1.13 million program
is being funded through Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
Improvement grants, Pennsylvania's Alternative Fuels Incentive Grant
Program, and Equitable Gas.

AGENCY EXPLORING WAYS TO CONTINUE FEDERAL FLEET PROGRAM

      While Congress struggles to pass a 1996 fiscal year budget,
others are looking for ways to ensure the federal government continues
adding alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) to its fleet despite budget
cutbacks.  
      Since the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) established federal fleet
AFV requirements in 1992, much of the incremental costs have been paid
for by the U.S. Department of Energy.  This year Congress nixed DOE's
$20 million request for 1996 after rescinding funds in 1995.
      Without DOE funding, many doubt that federal agencies will
purchase AFVs in substantial numbers.  So DOE proposed an executive
order requiring that agencies meet EPACT's AFV mandate by paying for
it themselves.  The requirement stipulates that AFVs comprise 25% of
1996 federal fleet purchases, an estimated 12,500 vehicles.  The
proposed executive order has been supported by the natural gas and
electric vehicle industries, which have expressed concerned that EPACT
rule delays and Congressional funding rescissions are sending the
message that AFV program support is waning.
      The proposed executive order, which is expected to be reviewed
by the White House as early as next week, would also require that each
alternative fuel comprise at least 10% of the federal fleet's annual
AFV purchases, depending on commercial availability of fuels and
vehicles.
      So agencies with aggressive AFV programs would not be penalized,
the proposed executive order would direct the General Services
Administration to average the incremental costs across the entire
federal fleet.

ASSOCIATION CHARTS EV RECHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

      There are 888 non-residential electric vehicle charging outlets
across the United States, according to a survey released by the
Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA).  Of those, only
43 of the 219 charging locations are at public stations.  Most (72%)
are located in California, with Georgia having the second highest
concentration.
      Conductive charging sites account for about 90% of those
available.  Conductive charging utilizes a standard plug outlet with
metal-to-metal contact and will be used by Ford and Chrysler electric
vehicles.  General Motors announced it will produce its vehicles to be
charged inductively, which transfers power through a magnetic
connection with no direct contact.
      "This is an emerging transportation technology, and we are now
seeing only the very first commercial stages of vehicles and
chargers," said EVAA's executive director Robert Hayden.  The
association plans to release a site directory and will continue to
annually track infrastructure development.
      The EV industry is working to make greater inroads in charging
infrastructure.  The Electric Transportation Coalition's "EV Market
Launch" begins this year with workshops in 10 cities selected to
become "EV-Ready":  Los Angeles; Sacramento; Atlanta; Washington,
D.C.; Phoenix; New York City; Richmond; Boston; Detroit; and Ft.
Lauderdale.  The program will focus efforts in those areas to address
issues such as local, state and federal building codes, safety
training, fleet acquisition and charging availability.  The
coalition's goal is to place 5,000 new EVs on the road by 1997.

ENVIRONMENT CANADA TO EXPAND ECOLOGOtm PROGRAM FOR OXYGENATES

      Environment Canada is reviewing the possible expansion of its
automotive fuels category beyond just ethanol to consider granting a
variety of oxygenates and alternative fuels EcoLogotm status, which
would likely boost their sales.
      The government is considering opening the status to more than
just ethanol, for possible inclusion of MTBE, ETBE, TAME, propane,
methane, natural gas and low-sulfur diesel.  The group will consider
all types of automotive fuels, including those intended for use in
modified spark-ignition engines, such as compressed natural gas and
propane, as well as modified compression ignition engines.  Additional
categories may be added later.
      The EcoLogo status, part of Canada's Environmental Choice
Programtm, signifies the government's endorsement of the fuel as
environmentally responsible.  The EcoLogo appears on wholesale and
retail packages, and the government provides incentives to fleet
owners who use the recognized fuel.  Ethanol is the first and only
fuel granted EcoLogo status, but a routinely scheduled review is now
also underway to determine if it will retain its status.  The program
is revised every three years.
      "It's pretty safe to assume that ethanol will remain in the
program," said Kevin Gallagher, Marketing and Customer Relations for
TerraChoice Environmental Services, Inc., administrators of the
Environmental Choice Program.  "In fact, it's just beginning to take
off in Canada."  One company he cited has enjoyed 20% sales increases
in the last year and a half, since it was granted the status. 
      Preliminary testing conducted on ethanol reveals it comes close
to meeting the tentative draft standards.  A final determination is
expected by June 1996.  Ethanol blends of 5% or higher qualify for the
EcoLogo label at this time.  Canadians use 35 billion liters of
gasoline annually.
      To earn the status, Environment Canada will review currently
available life cycle information to determine if the fuel reduces
toxic emissions, global-warming substances and tropospheric ozone or
smog.  The fuels will be compared with an established matrix, and
scored for each of its stages against pollutant standards.  However,
the fuels won't be compared with each other, Gallagher explained.
