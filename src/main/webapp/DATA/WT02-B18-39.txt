<H2>Making Biodiversity Work for Conservation</H2>

</CENTER> 



<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>The Challenge</H3> <P>One of the most critical and imminent threats to the earth's biodiversity is deforestation.  It is estimated that an area of tropical forest the size of Florida is lost to timber, mining, grazing, and other destructive forces every year.  In total, an area larger than the size of France has been deforested in the Amazon region alone, over 12% of the world's most diverse ecosystem.  This exponential rate of destruction leads to the marginalization and decline of indigenous cultures and the irreversible loss of genetic resources, two valuable national resources.

<H3>CI's Response</H3> 



<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/POLICY/Biopros.jpg" ALT="Biopros.jpg - 5.3 K" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>In an effort to turn the tide of this destruction, Conservation International is attempting to transform today's search for wild plants and organisms holding chemical and genetic building blocks for important new medicines and crops into a powerful conservation tool.  This search, known as bioprospecting, has a tremendous potential for conservation and stewardship over biodiversity resources.  To this end, CI has designed a bioprospecting program to foster incentives for conservation in tropical countries, illustrating to governments and forest peoples alike the economic potential of their genetic resources and the traditional knowledge.  The stakes are high.  The annual world market for plant-derived drugs is estimated at $200 billion.

<H3>Activities</H3><P> 



CI has moved aggressively into the bioprospecting field.  We now have experience in initiating a major bioprospecting agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Suriname, and the National Institutes of Health. We have also broken new ground by assisting the governments of Madagascar and Indonesia in developing legislation governing access to genetic resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
