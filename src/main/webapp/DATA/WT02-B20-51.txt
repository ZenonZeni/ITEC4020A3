<B><I> Help!  I need research to support the value of appropriate programs for gifted and talented students.  There is opposition to the idea and we are conducting a campaign to show support for the program.

</B></I><P>The first step in planning responsible advocacy for gifted students is to 
contact your state Department of Education in your state's capitol and speak with the person responsible for gifted education.  Find out if your state has written material on state policies or regulations that affect education for students who are gifted.<P>  

Responsible advocacy also includes an active lobbying effort for a rigorous 
regular education curriculum.  There are several reasons to do so.  First, a 
gifted education curriculum is based on the regular education curriculum.  And 
every child is entitled to an appropriate education, including continuous 
learning experiences.  Second, if the gifted program is perceived as the only 
"good" education, then all parents are justified in wanting this for their 
child. When measuring the rigor of the gifted education curriculum, let two 
questions guide your actions:  (1) Can every child do this? (2) Should every 
child do this?  If the answer to either question is "yes," then the 
curriculum would be difficult to justify as appropriate solely for gifted 
students. <P>

Other documents that are useful for advocacy include the following:<BR>

This report on the educational needs of American gifted and talented students 
identifies indicators of an educational crisis, describes the current status of 
education for these students, and presents recommendations to meet the 
educational needs of these students.  Indicators demonstrating the need for 
change include the relatively poor performance by American students on 
international tests and the small number of students performing at the highest 
levels on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests.  Recent studies 
have shown that gifted and talented elementary school students have mastered 35-
40% of the curriculum in five basic subjects before they begin the school year; 
most regular classroom teachers make few, if any, provisions for talented 
students; highest achieving students study less than an hour a day; and only 2 
cents out of every $100 spent on K-12 education supports special opportunities 
for talented students.  A review describes how gifted and talented students are 
currently identified, the number of students served, the kind of support 
available, the kind of education most gifted and talented students receive, and 
characteristics of effective programs for these students.  Seven 
recommendations are offered: (1) set challenging curricular standards; (2) 
establish high-level learning opportunities; (3) ensure access to early 
childhood education; (4) increase learning opportunities for disadvantaged and 
minority children with outstanding talents; (5) broaden the definition of 
gifted (a broadened definition based on the federal Javits Gifted and Talented 
Education Act is offered); (6) encourage appropriate teacher training and 
technical assistance; and (7) match world performance.  (Contains 43

The Program Status Research Study examined the status of local programs for 
students with high abilities and reasons given by key personnel for program 
status.  A mail survey to 2,900 local personnel in 19 states (divided into four 
groups according to economic health and the existence or non-existence of a 
state mandate to provide services) yielded a response rate of 54 percent.  
Analysis indicated that programs in states with mandates and in good economic 
health are "intact" and "expanded," while programs in all other groups are 
being "threatened," "reduced," and "eliminated" in high numbers.  Respondents 
attributed intact programs to the existence of a state mandate and advocacy 
efforts and threatened programs to a decline in state and local funds.  
Respondents indicated that 75 percent of high ability students in grades 3-8 
receive program services, 50 percent in grades 1-2 and 9-12, receive similar 
services, but program services for students at the Pre-K to K level were almost 
nonexistent.  Interviews with four key personnel from each state confirmed the 
main reasons given by survey respondents for variations in program status.  Six 
guidelines with accompanying research support are offered, including, among 
others: (1) maintenance of advocacy efforts in states with good economic health 
and mandates; (2) increase of advocacy efforts in states with poor economic 
health and/or where mandates do not exist; and (3) focus of advocacy efforts on 
policy makers at the state government level.  Appendices include the survey and 
exemplary policy statements of school boards.  (Contains 60 references.) (DB)<Br>

This digest offers guidelines for group advocacy efforts on behalf of gifted 
education.  Four potential pitfalls are identified: using an adversarial rather 
than a persuasive approach; assuming that people in administrative and 
political positions are not too bright or not very knowledgeable--or both; 
being impatient; and ineffectively coping with intragroup tensions.  In 
contrast, effective advocacy involves four basic phases: needs assessment; 
planning; contact; and follow up and evaluation.  Eleven guidelines for 
establishing and maintaining a successful parent advocacy group are suggested 
and include: focus on a mission and a sense of purpose; include not only 
parents but also business leaders and school professionals; contact the state 
advocacy group; adopt a constitution that spells out the organization's goals; 
identify and respect the group that holds the power; allow professionals to 
develop the program; conduct short- and long-term evaluation of the advocacy 
process; and be an informed advocate.  (DB)<Br>

This speech addresses the educational needs of gifted children in the context 
of the existing educational system's philosophy and various reform efforts.  It 
first examines the doctrine of progress, suggesting that important educational 
change is glacial and much of what purports to be educational change is 
ephemeral.  It claims that the present prime directive of our educational 
system is to socialize job holders.  Such reform movements as "authentic 
assessment" are seen to be more efforts to hold schools accountable to 
government than true examples of educational change.  An alternative view is 
offered, which states that: (1) progress along the path of improvement is 
uncertain; (2) schooling tries to make people useful, but ends by dumbing them 
down; (3) good schooling entails enlightenment; and (4) education is a process 
of liberation that does not require schooling.  It is concluded that teachers 
of gifted students need to see their prime mission as care of students' 
intellect, rather than development of their hypothetical usefulness.  The 
existing "one best system" for all students is seen as in decline and suffering 
from an epidemic of "thoughtlessness" which can only be countered by an 
emphasis on thoughtfulness in the education of the gifted.  (Contains seven 
references.) (DB)<Br>

This speech by an educator and parent of gifted children addresses the 
problem of appropriate educational services for gifted children, concluding 
that advocacy for these children entails pushing for acceleration, an often 
neglected but effective option.  The paper begins with anecdotes which 
illustrate the unmet needs of gifted children and which identify recent trends 
questioning the economic utility of higher education.  The paper suggests that 
gifted children often learn laziness in school and that the goal for such 
children should not be "normalization" as it is for exceptional children with 
handicaps but, rather, maximization of the child's potential.  The presentation 
claims that rapid progress is needed to stimulate gifted children to stay 
gifted, and therefore acceleration should always be considered when developing 
Individualized Education Programs for gifted students.  A framework for rapid 
progress is offered, listing service and placement options ranging from regular 
age-grade placement to an advanced program in a special school.  (DB)<Br>

New York State does not have a mandate requiring differential instruction for 
gifted students but has increased services.  Factors promoting program 
development have included financial incentives, mandatory screening, 
educational reform, and vigorous advocacy.  Negative factors associated with 
lack of a mandate have been inequities in program access, program quality 
control, and limited teacher preparation programs.  (DB)<Br>
