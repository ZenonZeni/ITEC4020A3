<h1>UK report 1996</h1>
UK Report for the Cambridge meeting of the SCAR WORKING GROUP ON
GLACIOLOGY, August 1996<p>

<i>covering the period 1993-1996</i><p>
</center>
Submitted by Eric Wolff, <a href="http://www.nerc-bas.ac.uk/">British Antarctic Survey</a>
<p>

This report covers the three-year period from 1993 to 1996.  During this period, the UK has
continued to operate a significant glaciological programme in the Antarctic, mainly through the
Ice and Climate Division of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), but with some participation
from other groups.  This report will summarise the work carried out; for a fuller description,
information can be found in the BAS Annual Reports, and in the papers listed at the back of this
report.  The lead U.K. organisation for all the work described is BAS, except where explicitly
stated.<p>

<p>

<b>Ice and Atmosphere Chemistry</b><p>

<p>

Work in this area has included:<p>

<p>

Analysis and interpretation of new and existing cores from the Antarctic Peninsula.   Analysis
has been carried out on a sequence of cores spanning the Antarctic Peninsula (Dolleman Island,
Dyer Plateau, Gomez Nunatak, Beethoven Peninsula).  The data are being used to compare
climate trends across the Peninsula, and also contribute to the ITASE programme.<p>

Collection (in 1994-95), in collaboration with the Alfred-Wegener-Institut of cores from the two
domes of Berkner Island.  The core from the northern dome (Reinwarthhohe), collected with a
new BAS drill (based on an AWI design), is 152 m long, and covers about 600 years.  The core
from the southern dome (Thyssenhohe) is 178 m long, covering about 1200 years. A sequence of
shorter cores was also collected.  A preliminary dating, based on electrical measurements, is
complete, and detailed isotopic and chemical analysis is underway.  Berkner Island has been
identified as a promising potential site for a deeper drilling at a later stage.<p>

Interpretation of cores in the Weddell Sea area.  Study of the stable isotope records has shown
that these are affected by ice conditions (affecting the moisture sources) as well as by
temperature changes.  An improved understanding of this effect has allowed a more consistent
description of temperature changes over the last two centuries to be derived.  The factors
controlling the very strong signals of sulphur species in the Weddell Sea area have also been
investigated.<p>

Studies of airborne pollutants.  Work was completed on analysing and interpreting a profile of
heavy metals from Coats Land, Antarctica.  This showed that the lead concentration increased  by
a factor approximately 3 during the period 1920-1980, with a subsequent small decrease.  This
mirrors trends in southern hemisphere lead usage.  the effect of Antarctic stations has also been
considered, and is estimated to be small beyond a few km from the station, although aircraft may
cause wider dispersal of pollutants.<p>

Air-snow transfer studies.  BAS has made a major effort at improving understanding of how
atmospheric signals are recorded in ice cores.  This has centred on analysis and interpretation of
aerosol and snow samples collected at Halley station.  These are being set in the frame of studies
undertaken simultaneously at Dumont d'Urville and Neumayer stations.  A new automated
aerosol sampler is being developed to carry out similar studies at remote ice core sites.<p>

Preparatory work for EPICA deep drilling in Antarctica.  The European Project for Ice Coring in
Antarctica (EPICA) is being funded by 10 European nations and by the European Union.  BAS
will be involved both in work on the Dome C (DC) deep core, and the reconnaissance work in
Dronning Maud Land (DML).  Planned scientific contributions include chemical analysis both at
DML and DC, electrical studies at DC, and ice radar studies in DML.  Groups from the School of
Environmental Sciences at University of East Anglia, and from the Open University, also plan to
take part in gas analyses of the cores, and are starting to test their procedures on existing cores
held by BAS.  The Rock Mechanics Laboratory at University College London have already
undertaken studies of ice mechanical properties on cores from the  Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (in
collaboration with AWI), and also plan to participate in EPICA.<p>

<b>Ice Dynamics</b><p>

<p>

Work in this area has included:<p>

<p>

Studies of ice-ocean interactions beneath the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf.  In 1995/96, the
improved BAS hot-water drill was used to complete an access hole through 825 m of ice just
west of Korff Ice Rise in the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf.  this complements two earlier holes
which have been instrumented in the past.  Conductivity, temperature and current meters have
been placed in and below the ice shelf at this site, and data from all three sites have been studied
to improve our knowledge of the sub-ice shelf regime.  Numerical models of the water flow
beneath the ice shelf, and of the interaction of the ice shelf with the water below it, have been
constructed, and compared with the data.<p>

Oceanographic studies in the Ross, Amundsen, Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas.  Studies (some
in collaboration with U.S. scientists, and using U.S. logistics) have been carried out, particularly
along ice fronts.  One notable finding has been of the very high melt rate from Pine Island
Glacier in the Bellingshausen Sea.  Such measurements have allowed a reassessment of the
Antarctic mass balance.<p>

Studies of ice shelf disintegration.  Remote sensing studies have shown that several ice shelves
fringing the Antarctic peninsula are in retreat.  This culminated in the break-up of a large part of
the Larsen Ice Shelf in early 1995.  This event has been studied by BAS, and by scientists from
other countries.<p>

Remote sensing studies.  A new high-powered airborne ice radar has been built.  This has
collected ice thickness data from various areas, including the Ronne Ice Shelf, and the Rutford
and Evans Ice Streams.  BAS has made detailed studies of the use of Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar (INSAR) over Antarctic ice.  A particular application of INSAR has been the
confirmation of  the slow movement of Carlson Inlet compared to  neighbouring Rutford Ice
Stream.  Ground-based survey measurements have also been made at these and other locations. 
Scientists from  Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Scott Polar Research Institute, and
University of Wales, used ice radar and satellite altimetry data to contribute to renewed studies,
led by Russian scientists, of the freshwater Lake Vostok, which lies beneath the Antarctic ice
sheet.<p>

Investigations of ice stream beds.  Seismic studies have been carried out to investigate the ice
stream bed, and the ice-bed interface in Rutford Ice Stream.  This work has shown that basal
conditions are very variable on a scale of a few kilometres.<p>

Ice sheet modelling.  Work has been carried out on modelling marine ice sheets, modelling flow
patterns at ice divides (of great interest to the ice core community), and modelling erosional
processes occurring at the base of ice sheets.  Modelling studies of the stability of the East
Antarctic ice sheet are also underway at the Geography Department of the University of
Edinburgh.  These studies contribute to the European Ice Sheet Modelling Initiative (EISMINT).<p>

<b>Sea ice studies<p>

<p>

</b>Scientists at the Scott Polar Research Institute have been studying the SAR signatures and
physical properties of MIZ ice in the western Weddell Sea during summer.  In a collaboration
with NIPR, Tokyo, they have compared the SAR signatures of Japanese ERS versus European
ERS-1/2  instruments, over Antarctic sea ice near Syowa. They have also investigated light
penetration through MIZ sea ice in spring.<p>

<p>

<b>Planned work</b><p>

<p>

Work will continue in most of the areas outlined above.  Major field programmes in the next few
years include:<p>

<p>

1. Participation in EPICA, both at Dome C and through ice coring and radar studies at DML;<p>

<p>

2. Hot water drilling south of Berkner Island;<p>

<p>

3. Shipborne oceanographic studies at the western Ronne ice front;<p>

<p>

4. Ice dynamics studies in Ellsworth Land;<p>

<p>

5. Passive and active seismic studies on Rutford and Carlson ice streams.<p>
