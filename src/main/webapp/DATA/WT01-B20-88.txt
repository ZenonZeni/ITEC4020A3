<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- What started out
to be a day of peace and love quickly descended into violence and
arrests, as this year's spring Hemp Fest at Credit Island Park
was closed early Saturday afternoon by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-three people were arrested
on charges ranging from possession of controlled substances to
assault, and one Davenport police officer was seriously injured. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police and festival participants
alike described the incident as a &quot;riot&quot; situation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-year-old police officer, a
16-year veteran of the department, suffered a leg injury that
requleed surgery at a local hospital. Because he is an undercover
officer, his name was not released by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reported no other injuries. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's festival began at noon.
Shortly before 1 p.m., police began making arrests.</tt></font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's when some of the
festival-goers violently resisted arrest and started
&quot;throwing bottles and rocks,&quot; said Officer Dave
Kanaack, one of about 20 officers at the scene. &quot;Our intent
was not to close the park down, but juat to monitor the situation
with regard to Iowa laws.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since possession and recreational
use of hemp, from which marijuana is derived, is illegal, Officer
Kanaack said, &quot;We're not just going to look the other
way.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, some of the
festival-goers held a different viewpoint. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's not right. We should be
able to do what we want,&quot; said Joe Smith of Rock Island, who
came to the festival just before the violence broke out.
&quot;Everybody was just having a good time until this started. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It just broke out out of the
blue,&quot; he said after police closed the island at 1:33 p.m. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said many in the crowd
defended those who were being arrested. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everybody stood up for
everybody else,&quot; he said, estimating the crowd to be about
1,000. Other crowd estimates were much lower. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said police officers
used Mace to control and subdue the festival-goers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer Kanaack said &quot;there
was an accident with a police officer&quot; who was trying to
control one individual and &quot;some residual spray got in the
direction of the crowd. Unfortunately, a lot of people were
involved in this.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hubert Evans of Davenport, who
left the park just before the riot broke out, called the police
department later Saturday to complain about their treattuent of
the public. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't appreciate them
being so reckless with people's lives, walking around
intimidating people,&quot; he said of police behavior before
arrests were made. &quot;They were creating a military threat in
a peaceful situation. It was deliberately provocative.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It used to be so different
at the different locations. They were so much more lenient,&quot;
said Sharon Valle of Bettendoff. &quot;Occasionally, cops would
stop by and look intimidating. But it would be very
peaceful.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least three men still were
being held in the Scott County Jail Saturday night. According to
a jail spokesman, the men, whose ages and addresses were not
available, were: Joseph Loughead, charged with rioting and
interference with official acts; Christopher Rice, charged with
assault with injury to a Police officer, rioting and Interference
with official acts; and Michael Winterlin, charged with assault
with injury to a police officer, interference with official acts
and disorderly conduct. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemp Pest organizer Robert
Moldenhauer of Rock Island was arrested and charged with unlawful
assembly, failure to disperse and possession. He could not be
reached Saturday for comment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Davenport officer Saturday night
said the department may be perceived to be harsher than others
because &quot;we've always pretty much had zero tolercance on any
kind of drug activity.&quot; He said that reflects Chief Steve
Lynn's position. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's melee wes not the first
time tensions have risen between police and attendants of Hemp
Fest in the Quad-Cities. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police made &quot;several&quot;
arrests in May 1995 during a festival at Loud Thunder Forest
Preserve near Andalusia. Charges ranged from possession of
cannabis, minors in possession of alcohol and contributing to the
delinquency of minors all misdemeanors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rock Island County Sheriff
Department Capt. Richard Fisher said at the time that the Loud
Thunder event &quot;was a complete disaster.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 1993, Moline police
received complaints of illegal drug use, fighting, open profanity
and yards being used as bathrooms during a hemp fest in Prospect
Park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that event, Moline Police
Chief Steve Etheridge said officers declined to make arrests in
Prospect Park, fearing the actions &quot;would start a
riot.&quot;</tt> </p>
