<h1><font size="3">Meta-Analysis of Adolescent Crime and
Substance Use, 1981-1995</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">Gordon E. Kenney, Ph.D. The University of
Memphis Memphis, Tennessee, USA 38152 </font><a
href="mailto:gkenney@memphis.edu"><font size="3">gkenney@memphis.edu</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">December, 1996</font></p>

<p><font size="3">INTRODUCTION </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The use of psychoactive substances has been
cited by drug enforcement officials as a cause of criminal
behavior. Apart from the manufacture, sale, and/or delivery of
illicit substances, substance *use* has been regarded as a
primary precipitant of criminal behavior, especially violent
behavior (e.g., Drug Enforcement Administration, 1994). To date,
however, it seems that such assertions have been based on
anecdotal evidence, with little, if any, empirical support. Even
data from the federal government fails to support such a link.
For example, during 9 contemporaneous reporting periods between
1972 and 1990, the correlations between adolescent (ages 17 and
younger) violent, property, and overall crime rates and mean
adolescent (ages 12-17) usage rates for 10 substances (both licit
and illicit) were .09, .27, and .20, respectively (Federal Bureau
of Investigation, 1972-90; National Institute on Drug Abuse,
1991). These correlations can hardly be viewed as suggestive of
any meaningful relationships between crime and substance use.
Such evidence, however, is circumstantial. Other indicators are
needed to establish any real relationship, whether large or
small, between crime and drug use.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The purpose of this study was to excavate the
body of recent scholarly research in this domain for any evidence
concerning the role of substance use in criminal acts perpetuated
by adolescents and to summarize these findings using
meta-analysis (Wolf, 1986).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">METHOD &amp; PROCEDURES </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Scholarly research products of a primary nature
were gleaned from social science databases (including
Dissertation Abstracts International, Educational Resources
Information Clearinghouse, PsycLit, and metropolitan Memphis,
Tennessee, book holdings). The search was limited to studies
concerning adolescent criminology reported between 1981 and 1995.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Resultant inferential statistics from each
study pertaining to general delinquency, reoffense, and/or
violence as each related to substance use were converted to
effect sizes in the form of r using Wolf's (1986) formulae. The r
statistic, here used as an effect size, remains essentially a
correlation coefficient which ranges from -1.0 to +1.0, where
-1.0 constitutes a perfect negative relationship, +1.0
constitutes a perfect positive relationship, and 0.0 constitutes
absolutely no relationship. A squared correlation coefficient
(r^2) represents the percentage of shared variance among the
variables in question.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">RESULTS </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Fifteen (15) primary research studies were
found which met the aforementioned criteria (see Table 1). Of
these, 13 were conducted in 10 states in the United States, and 2
were conducted in Canada. There were 6 research articles from
refereed journals, 6 dissertations/theses, 2 unpublished
conference research presentations, and 1 unpublished research
report. A total of 3,583 adolescent offenders were involved in
these 15 studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The mean unweighted r for the relationship
between adolescent crime and substance use was .22 (df = 13, not
significant), with a median of .17, and a range of .00 to .68.
The amount of shared variance between overall adolescent crime
and substance use was about 5%. The strength of these effect size
estimates was considered low.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only 4 of the studies investigated the
relationship between adolescent violent crime and substance use
(total number of offenders studied was 834). The mean unweighted
r for these studies was .10 (df = 13, not significant), with a
median of .08, and a range of .07 to .15. The amount of shared
variance between violent adolescent crime and substance use was
1%. These effect size estimates were considered very low.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Note. Studies listed
chronologically. Two-letter locale codes refer to states in the
USA. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">No discernible temporal pattern was observed.
Overall, the correlation between year of study and effect size
estimate was .02 (df = 13, not significant), which was considered
very low.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among 7 studies conducted in the
&quot;north&quot; (i.e., Canada, Idaho, Iowa, Massachusetts, and
Washington) the mean unweighted effect size was .23 (df = 5, not
significant), with a median of .25, and a range of .00 to 55.
This effect size was considered low. Among 8 studies conducted in
the &quot;south&quot; (i.e., Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) the mean unweighted effect size
was .22 (df = 6, not significant), with a median of .16, and a
range of .00 to .68. This effect size was considered low. The
effect sizes based on geography were not considered to be
substantially different.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Gender, ethnocultural heritage, property
crimes, and particular substances used were not evaluated because
these variables were seldom noted in more than a few of the
selected studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">CONCLUSIONS The relationship between adolescent
crime and substance use was found to be small. Overall, substance
use accounted for only about 5% of the variance associated with
overall adolescent criminal behavior, and less than 1% of the
variance associated with adolescent violent behavior. These
findings were remarkably similar to those involving federal
government data noted earlier. Neither temporal nor geographic
patterns were observed concerning the effect size estimates
reported in the 15 studies.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Therefore, assertions about the precipitous
role of substance use in adolescent crime do not appear to be
supported by the body of recent scholarly research in this area.
Similar investigations concerning adult crime and substance use
are warranted before any definite conclusions may be reached
about this controversial issue. It is clear, however, that
adolescent substance use, though a crime in and of itself, is not
fundamentally related to broader indices of adolescent crime.</font></p>
