The Department of Clinical Psychobiology, directed by Dr. Jack Gorman, consists of three separate components: schizophrenia research, anxiety disorders research, and depression research.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Schizophrenia Research</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A major focus of the Department of Clinical Psychobiology continues to be schizophrenia research. These efforts received important support with the funding of the Developing Clinical Research Center for the Study of Schizophrenia in August, 1994. This five-year grant is directed at elucidating the genetic and environmental determinants of schizophrenia. The study integrates research conducted on 38 inpatient research beds at Psychiatric Institute lead by Dr. Scott Clark, and at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center lead by Dr. Zafar Sharif.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Studies currently underway with the Center's various cores include:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Diagnosis &amp; Assessment Core</B>  (Dr. Xavier Amador and colleagues)-Evaluation psychopathology and psychophysiology in inpatients and their first degree relatives; assessment of awareness of illness; assessment of affective deficits in patients.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Genetics Core</B>  (Drs. Charles Kaufmann, Dolores Malaspina, Jill Harkavy Friedman, and colleagues)-Clarification of the relative roles of gene and environment on putative biological markers for schizophrenia; reduction of etiologic heterogeneity through the identification of phenotypic characteristics of highly familial schizophrenia; recruitment of parent/affected offspring "triads" for linkage disequilibrium studies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Epidemiology Core</B>  (Drs. Ezra Susser, Alan Brown, and colleagues)-Development of unique birth cohorts (located in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and the Netherlands) in which both genetic and epigenetic risk factors may be specified and their relative contributions to schizophrenia outcomes may be evaluated.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Neuroimmunology/Neuropathology Core</B>  (Drs. Norman Latov, Saud Sadiq, David Strauss, Andrew Dwork, and colleagues)-Replication of the finding of elevations in antibodies against the human heat shock protein in schizophrenia; evaluation of the specificity of this finding; mapping of the antigenic epitopes mediating the immune response recognizing of their similarity to proteins of known pathogens; identification of alterations in a neuronal protein, MAP2, in post-mortem subiculum.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Neuroimaging/Neurobiology Core</B>  (Drs. Dolores Malaspina, Ronald van Heertum, and colleagues)-Examining the role of dopamine D4 receptor alterations via SPECT, as well as examining the relationship between structural and functional hippocampal changes via MRI/MRS. These nascent neuroimaging efforts have been further strengthened by a major grant from the Mathers Foundation.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Anxiety Disorder Research</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Laszlo A. Papp is in charge of this group of studies which are based at Psychiatric Institute in the Biological Studies Unit and at the Phobia, Anxiety, and Stress Disorders Clinic at Hillside Hospital. Drs. Papp and Gorman continue to focus on the role of respiratory abnormalities in anxiety disorders. Aided by several RO1 grants, among them the largest NIMH-sponsored treatment study of panic disorder, they have evaluated the respiratory status of hundreds of panic patients before and after medication treatment and psychotherapy. In two independent samples, they have found significant medication-but not psychotherapy-also altered respiratory sensitivity. Respiratory challenges have also been conducted under "tryptophan depletion" condition and during "varying cognitive" environments. In collaboration with Drs. Pine, Schaffer, and Wasserman, the respiratory challenge strategy has been extended to include children with anxiety disorders. Drs. Papp and Ethan Gorenstein have begun to develop a new area of research-the assessment and treatment of patients with late-life disorders.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Jeremy Coplan continues his work with Dr. Leonard Rosenblum in non-human primates, studying the neurobiological effects of separation, and developing animal models for human anxiety. Dr. Coplan is also involved with the Department of Child Psychiatry in a series of biological challenges in children, including a collaboration with Dr. Janet Fairbanks to study young children at risk for behavioral inhibition.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Mindy Fullilove continues her promising work with patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, developing intervention strategies for use with inner city women with PTSD. Dr. Fullilove was appointed to the National Task Force on AIDS Development, to the editorial board of the American Journal of Psychiatry, and to the editorial board of Current Issues <BR>
in Public Health.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Jack Gorman, Richard Sloan, and Peter Shapiro continue their work with cardiac transplant patients. They study the effect of psychological stress on the heart, focusing on heart rate variability as a biological risk factor for myocardial infarction.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Depression Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Julie Hatterer continues to study "CSF Transthyretin in Refractory Depression." Together with Dr. Steven Roose and Dr. Joseph Herbert of New York University, we are pursuing this work along with other studies of thyroid hormone effects in depressed patients.
