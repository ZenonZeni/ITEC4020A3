<h2>2.2 Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Background</strong><br>
<p>
The December 1994 Program Plan described an approach for the Waste Acceptance, Storage,
and Transportation Project that included efforts to develop a multi-purpose canister by 1998 for
possible at-reactor storage; to maintain readiness to develop an interim storage facility if a site
were designated by the Congress and the authority and resources were provided; and to develop a
readiness to accept and transport spent nuclear fuel from reactors to a storage facility whenever
such a facility became available. The waste acceptance and transportation capability was to be
based on certifying a new high-capacity truck cask and a transportation overpack for the
multi-purpose canisters and constructing prototypes by the end of 1998. A fleet of casks or
overpacks would be purchased when a firm shipment schedule was available.
<p>
Further Presidential and Congressional guidance, together with reduced funding, have led to a
reassessment and redirection of the approach outlined in the 1994 Program Plan. The Waste
Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project's funding level was reduced by 76 percent from
$57 million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $13.6 million in Fiscal Year 1996. The reduction reflects the
Congressional reservation of $85 million from the Program's total $400 million appropriation
pending legislative authorization to develop an interim storage facility. 
<p>
The Congress is considering legislation that would direct rapid development of an interim storage
facility and designate a specific facility site. The Administration, however, opposes designation
of a site and any site-specific facility development work until the completion of a viability
assessment of Yucca Mountain as a geologic repository site in 1998.
<p>
<strong>A Revised Strategy</strong><br>

We have developed a revised strategy that will enable the Program to acquire the 
capability for waste acceptance, storage, and transportation as rapidly and efficiently as possible,
consistent with current guidance from the President and the Congress, and reflecting the
consequences of the reduced program funding level for Fiscal Year 1996. The later years of the
schedule are based on an assumption that after completion of the Yucca Mountain viability
assessment in 1998, the Program will receive the necessary statutory authority, sufficient
funding, and a site designation to initiate work on an interim storage facility in 1999.
<p>
Prior to interim storage facility site designation, the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project will establish a blueprint for the development of waste acceptance,
storage, and transportation systems. Activities during this period will be directed towards
achieving two major near-term objectives.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a market-driven waste acceptance, storage, and transportation approach that
relies on the private sector for implementation.
<li>Conduct non-site specific design and engineering safety analyses for an interim storage
facility to reduce facility licensing time once a site is designated.
</ul><p>
After designation of a storage facility site, Project activities will address development of an
interim storage facility at the specified site and the acquisition of related waste acceptance,
storage, and transportation services. These activities consist of system design and implementation
efforts that can occur only after a site has been designated, and thus are contingent on further
Presidential and Congressional action that provides statutory authority, funding, and storage
facility site designation. Assuming that these Presidential and Congressional actions are
completed in 1999, we would award multiple contracts for waste acceptance, storage modules,
and transportation services and equipment in the same year and submit our environmental
analyses, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and our license application
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2000. If the Program is given legislative authorization
to commence facility construction upon submittal of a license application, as was recently
proposed in the Congress, the target date to begin accepting spent fuel at an interim storage
facility could be as early as 2002. Activities and milestones planned for the period after site
designation are depicted in <a href="./fig9.gif"><em>Figure 9 </em></a>on page 67 and described further in <a href="./appc.htm"><em>Appendix C</a></em>.
<p>
In addition to priority activities directly associated with the two major near-term objectives and
summarized below, the Project will continue various support activities that will play a significant
role in successful  implementation of  the waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
components of the waste management system. These activities are described in<em> Section 2.2.2</em>.
<p>
<h4>2.2.1     Priority Activities to Achieve Major Near-Term Objectives</h4>
<p>
<strong>Developing a market-driven waste acceptance, storage, and transportation approach that relies on
the private sector for implementation</strong><br>
The Program plans to rely upon a competitive private sector procurement to create the necessary
national transportation capability to move spent nuclear fuel from locations throughout the
United States to a centralized interim storage facility. This capability would also be utilized to
transport waste to a permanent disposal facility. We intend to publish a Notice of Expression of
Interest in publications such as the <em>Federal Register, Commerce Business Daily,</em> and trade
journals to solicit industry and vendor views on the proposed approach, which is described
further in<a href="./appc.htm"><em> Appendix C</em></a>. We will be prepared to issue a request for proposals and award multiple
contracts for equipment and services on a timely basis when the national policy and schedule for
near-term management of spent nuclear fuel are resolved. This approach will offer a market
stimulus for private sector development of equipment and management capability required for
the transportation of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
<strong>Conducting non-site specific design and engineering safety analyses for an interim storage
facility to reduce facility development time once a site is designated</strong><br>
The Program will pursue opportunities to carry out preliminary work relating to the licensing of
an interim storage facility in advance of site designation,  including development of a facility
design based on conservatively determined environmental and design parameters that can
accommodate virtually any site, and performance of safety analyses. We will initiate interactions
with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to discuss and evaluate non-site specific safety issues.
Siting evaluation factors contained in Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations (10 CFR Part
72) and other Commission guidance will be used to assist in developing conservative design
parameters.
<p>
Subject to future funding considerations, the Program will complete a topical safety analysis
report for submittal to the Commission. Submittal of the topical safety analysis report and its
subsequent review by the Commission, ahead of site designation, will reduce the time required
later for preparation of the license application and reduce licensing risks related to design and
safety considerations. The report would describe facility design, operations, and supporting
systems; demonstrate conformance with the Commission's siting evaluation factors and general
design criteria; and present the results of radiological and safety analyses. The report would
contain the required analyses and evaluations necessary to demonstrate that operation of the
facility would not endanger the health and safety of the public. The Commission will document
its review and approval of the topical safety analysis report in a safety evaluation report which,
along with the topical safety analysis report, will be referenced in any subsequent interim storage
facility license application.
<p>
<h4>2.2.2     Other Activities Supporting Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</h4> 
<p>
<strong>Waste Acceptance Activities</strong><br>
Waste acceptance activities are those necessary for the Department of Energy to take title to and
physical possession of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste from owners and
generators of these wastes. In addition to the physical transfer of ownership, waste acceptance
activities include the planning, preparation, and completion of the procedures and documentation
necessary to accomplish the transfer. Waste acceptance is the first step in fulfilling the
Department's responsibility to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
The Program will conduct the following activities to support its waste acceptance responsibility.
<p>
<em>Interaction with contract holders</em>. The Program will continue activities in support of the standard
contract, codified in 10 CFR Part 961, for acceptance of commercial spent fuel from nuclear
utilities. Review and approval of delivery commitment schedules from utilities will continue. 
<p>
<em>Integration of Federal spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level radioactive waste into program
plans.</em> The Program will complete a memorandum of agreement with the Department of Energy's
Office of Environmental Management creating a unified system for the acceptance of Federal
spent fuel and defense high-level radioactive waste destined for geologic disposal. We will also
complete the development of acceptance criteria for these wastes.
<p>
<em>Preparing for material control and accounting of accepted waste.</em> The Program will continue
interactions with government agencies, utilities, and others to establish safeguards and security
requirements for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to be accepted by the
Department. Spent fuel verification requirements for utilities will be developed, and mechanisms
will be established for documenting and maintaining information on all spent fuel and high-level
radioactive waste loaded into sealed canisters. A unified data base system will be developed and
implemented in phases. The system will integrate existing data bases and provide a single source
of data for common use to support waste acceptance planning and operations, including
continued tracking of spent fuel generation, material control and accounting, and spent fuel
verification.
<p>
<strong>Storage Activities</strong><br>
In addition to planning for the potential development of an interim storage facility and associated
services and equipment, the Program's storage support activities will include technology
demonstration projects that may benefit one or more areas of the Program, and close-out of
activities related to the multi-purpose canister system. 
<p>
<em>Dry Transfer System.</em> The Spent Nuclear Fuel Dry Transfer System Development and
Demonstration Project, conducted under a cooperative agreement with the Electric Power
Research Institute, will be continued. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a low cost
system for handling individual spent fuel assemblies in the absence of a spent fuel storage pool.
The transfer of spent fuel into a cask or between casks generally takes place under water in
storage pools which provide cooling and shielding. Spent fuel storage pools may not be available
in the future at some reactor sites, such as reactors that are no longer operating, or at an interim
storage facility. In Fiscal Year 1996, the Program will also submit a topical safety analysis report
on the Dry Transfer System design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for review and
approval.
<p>
<em>Multi-Purpose Canister System</em>. We will close out efforts related to the development of a
multi-purpose canister system. The Department of the Navy, which had been a cooperating
agency on the Environmental Impact Statement for the multi-purpose canister system, has
become the lead agency and will proceed with the part of the Environmental Impact Statement
covering naval spent nuclear fuel container selection. The Program's documentation of its work
related to preparing an Environmental Impact Statement and developing designs for the
multi-purpose canister system will be archived. The Program will complete as scheduled the first
phase of the contract with Westinghouse Electric Corporation for development of a
multi-purpose canister design and completion of safety analysis reports.
<p>
<strong>Transportation Activities</strong><br>
<em>High-capacity truck cask.</em> Due to funding reductions, the contract with General Atomics to
design, develop, certify, and fabricate the GA-4 and GA-9 high-capacity legal-weight truck cask
system is being terminated. Cask designs have been completed. To support certification efforts,
safety analysis reports were submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and a half-scale
model of the GA-4 cask design was fabricated and tested.
<p>
<em>Obtaining "burnup credit" for cask or canister design.</em> "Burnup" is a measure of the amount of
fissionable material in reactor fuel that is used up in the nuclear fission process while the fuel is
in a reactor. The fuel burnup process also produces fissionable material and a variety of neutron
absorbing materials. The net effect is a decrease in reactivity (the fuel's ability to support a chain
reaction) over time. As the fissionable material is depleted in this way and neutron absorbers
build up, the reactivity of the fuel declines. Nuclear Regulatory Commission practices for safety
calculations for spent fuel storage and transportation technologies use the conservative
assumption that the fuel is fresh (with zero burnup) and therefore has the highest possible
reactivity.
<p>
Burnup credit refers to the concept of taking regulatory credit in required safety calculations for
the reductions in spent nuclear fuel reactivity that occur as a result of the usage of fuel in a
reactor. Obtaining burnup credit will improve overall system efficiency and may be important to
disposal.
<p>
The Program will continue to pursue partial (actinide-only) and principal isotope burnup credit
(actinide and selected fission products) to support the design of criticality control systems for
spent fuel storage, transportation, and disposal packages. Interactions with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission will be pursued on issues related to the partial burnup topical report we
issued in May 1995, and on planning experiments to support principal isotope burnup credit. In
Fiscal Year 1998, the Program will submit a topical report on principal isotope burnup credit to
the Commission.
<p>
<strong>Institutional Activities</strong><br>
Institutional activities of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project have been
reduced significantly in Fiscal Year 1996. These reductions include termination of institutional
work on the multi-purpose canister Environmental Impact Statement; funding cuts for all
cooperative agreements with State, tribal, regional, and technical organizations; suspension of
meetings of the Transportation Coordination Group (a long-standing group that represents a
broad range of public agencies and stakeholder groups); and termination or curtailment of
various public information activities and products.
<p>
Core transportation-related institutional activities will be maintained. The Program will continue
interactions with stakeholders to plan the implementation of Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act, which provides for technical and financial assistance to States and Indian Tribes for
training public safety officials through whose jurisdictions spent nuclear fuel and high-level
waste would be transported. In 1996, we will publish a<em> Federal Register</em> Notice of Proposed
Policy and Procedures for the implementation of Section 180(c) in which public comments will
be solicited. In the following year, the Program will publish a Notice of Final Policy and
Procedures to implement Section 180(c) of the Act.
<p>
We will also maintain interactions with stakeholders and with other Department offices through
the Transportation External Coordination and the Transportation Internal Coordination working
groups, and will continue to participate in meetings and briefings held by other parties to identify
issues, clarify policy options, and resolve issues wherever possible.
