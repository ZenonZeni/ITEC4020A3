<BR>
An analysis of biomass burning for the Australian continent: 1990-1998.
[R.D. Graetz] <BR>
<BR>
OBJECTIVE <BR>
<BR>
This project will extend the analysis of biomass burning over the Australian
continent currently being undertaken by the author for the period 1981-1990
(NGGI-funded) to 1998, thereby providing and publishing a total record of
17 years. This record will be used to: quantify the relative influence of
climate (interannual variation), landuse (people), and their interaction
in determining fire frequency; detect and interpret trends in continental
fire regime, 1981-1998; model the impact of future climate and landuse scenarios
(to 2060) on fire frequencies. <BR>
<BR>
This proposal, and a companion 'Ozflux: The translation of GCM simulations
of future climates into impacts at landscape scales', by Raupach, Cleugh
&amp; Graetz, have been submitted for funding to DEST in response to its
initiative on Climate Change Impact Assessment. <BR>
<BR>
Both this proposed subproject and D6 which follows, will make extensive
use of the experience and data from the GMS Pathfinder Project, and potentially
from the VEGETATION instrument to be carried on SPOT 4 in 1997. A strategic
objective of the Global Change Project is data integration; not only of
remotely sensed data with that from other sources, but also between space
datasets, see later. <BR>

ARTEMIS: Australia, Real-Time Environmental Monitoring Information System
[Graetz, R.D. et al]<BR>
<BR>
OBJECTIVE <BR>
<BR>
To develop a continental-scale, Terrestrial Biosphere Monitoring System
with which to detect and interpret the progress of Global Change, retrospectively
and prospectively. <BR>
<BR>
This subproject is being planned in anticipation of a national requirement
for this capability and capacity that has yet to emerge, but for which the
EOC could be the principal contributor. <BR>
<BR>
It is planned that such a capability would exploit the synergy of the AVHRR
data stream with that of GMS. The contribution of the Global Change Project
to the GMS Pathfinder Project is to enact and explore this synergy in the
derivation of seven Level 3 products; <BR>
