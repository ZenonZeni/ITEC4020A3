<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The difficulty in life is the choice.&quot; </p>

<p>George Moore (1900) </p>

<p>A constant tension exists in our society between individual
liberties and the need for reasonable societal restraints. It is
easy to go too far in either direction, and this tendency is
particularly evident where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>We have guided our decision-making by the belief that the
state is obliged to justify restraints on individual behavior.
Too often individual freedoms are submerged in the passions of
the moment, and when that happens, the public policy may be
determined more by rhetoric than by reason. Our effort has been
to minimize the emotional and emphasize the rational in this
Report. </p>

<p><b>Drugs In a Free Society</b> </p>

<p>A free society seeks to provide conditions in which each of
its members may develop his or her potentialities to the fullest
extent. A premium is placed on individual choice in seeking
self-fulfillment. This priority depends upon the capacity of free
citizens not to abuse their freedom, and upon their willingness
to act responsibly toward others and toward the society as a
whole. Responsible behavior, through individual choice, is both
the guarantor and the objective of a free society. <br>
</p>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>The use of drugs is not in itself an irresponsible act.
Medical and scientific uses serve important individual and social
needs and are often essential to our physical and mental
well-being. Further, the use of drugs for pleasure or other
non-medical purposes is not inherently irresponsible; alcohol is
widely used as an acceptable part of social activities. </p>

<p>We do think the use of drugs is clearly irresponsible when it
impedes the individual's integration into the economic and social
system. A preference for individual productivity and contribution
to social progress in a general sense still undergirds the
American value structure, and we emphasize the policy-maker's
duty to support this preference in a public policy judgment. </p>

<p>At the same time, in light of the emerging leisure ethic and
the search for individual meaning and fulfillment noted in
Chapter 1, we cannot divorce social policy from the questions
raised by the recreational use of drugs. Productivity and
recreation both have a place in the American ethical system. They
are not inconsistent unless the individual's use of leisure time
inhibits his productive role in society. </p>

<p>Drugs should be servants, not masters. They become masters
when they dominate an individual's existence or impair his
faculties. To the extent that any drug, including alcohol,
carries with it risks to the well-being of the user and seriously
undermines his effectiveness in the society, that drug becomes a
matter of concern for public policy. </p>

<p>An essential step in the process of policy-formation is a
determination of the circumstances under which use of any given
drug' poses such risks. For some drugs, the risks may be so great
that all permissible measures should be taken to eliminate use.
For other drugs, such risks may be present only under certain
specific circumstances, in which case society may defer to
responsible individual choice on the matter of recreational use
but take appropriate steps to minimize the incidence and
consequences of dysfunctional use. In our Report next year, for
which studies are already underway, we will consider from this
perspective the whole range of drugs now used for non-medical
purposes. </p>
