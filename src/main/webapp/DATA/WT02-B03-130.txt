<CENTER><P><B>JUICER INFORMATION</B> </P>
</CENTER><P>Dr. Gerson was very specific in his requirements
for special equipment for the best juice extraction for
patients on the Gerson Therapy. He found, and it was later
confirmed, that centrifugal juicers are not acceptable. There
are several possible combinations of juicers that fulfill
Gerson's equirement of a separate grinder and then a press to
accomplish the best extraction: </P>
<P>NORWALK JUICER- automatic with hydraulic press connected
to the motor and effortless to operate. Cost $1995-$2095 (4
models - different finishes. New models work on 50/60 cycles.
Available at the hospital from the local distributor, or
call: Richard Boger at 1-800-405-8423, or outside USA 619 755
8423. </P>
<P>K &amp; K GRINDER &amp; PRESS - the grinder is connected
to an electric motor; the press is hand operated with a jack
and requires some strength of the arm and shoulder. Available
through Al Hasser, 14410 Big Canyon Rd, Middletown, CA 95461
Telephone 707-928-5970 (Shredder $600, Press $249 + shipping
&amp; handling or $825 + S&amp;H if ordered together) </P>
<P>CHAMPION - not used as a juicer but as a grinder only;
plus the K &amp; K press (see above). Champion cost is about
$240. Available through local health food stores.
Occasionally, the Gerson Institute has listings of secondhand
Norwalks which you may want to consider. Check with us at

 </A> </P>
<HR><CENTER><P><B>GERSON THERAPY BREAD</B> </P>
</CENTER><P>Bread is allowed on the Gerson Therapy in small
amounts, not to replace a meal, but to provide a little extra
if the patient has consumed the full meal of the necessary,
building foods. It is generally best not to try to bake your
own bread because it is very time consuming. Since bread is
not such an important part of the patient's intake, it is
best to buy it ready-made. There is some organic sourdough
all-rye bread available now, without salt, which is ideal for
the Gerson patient. It is made and distributed by: Rudolph's
Specialty Bakeries, 390 Alliance Avenue, Toronto M6N 2H8,
Ontario, Canada, (800) 268 1589, and is available in health
food stores. Nature's Path Foods (an additional source we've
been advised of) carries an organic rye-carrot-raisin bread
without salt: Jim Robitaille, 916 354 1108. <A
