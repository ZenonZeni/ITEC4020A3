                         FLAWED VISION

Will Bob Frankenberg's attempts to abandon the legacy of his
predecessor and refocus Novell on its core competencies work?

For Sale By Owner, read the sign hung outside Building E at
Novell's Provo, Utah headquarters last month. It was a prank, of
course, and was quickly torn down by security guards. But it
accurately reflected the mood of uncertainty at the 7,000-strong
networking software market leader, where a firesale is underway
of many of the 20 businesses Novell acquired over the past five
years and where rumours persist that IBM and AT&T are eyeing the
company for acquisition.

In the 18 months since Bob Frankenberg took over the chief
executive's role from company founder Ray Noorda, he has been
forced to make a series of screeching U-turns. Initially an
enthusiastic supporter of Noorda's vision for the company,
Frankenberg has had to face the harsh reality that many of the
industry-shaking strategies set in motion by Noorda in his final
years at Novell, now seem misguided and in need of dismantling.

The Noorda dream was multi-dimensional, but it had one underlying
theme - to build Novell into a company with a breadth of products
that could stand up to the 'Redmond bully', Microsoft's Bill
Gates. Through its June 1994 acquisition of WordPerfect and
Borland's Quattro Pro division, Novell would be able to compete
as the number two vendor in the office applications software
market. Success there would come from creating a new breed of
'network applications' that resulted from the combination of the
applications with Novell's flagship product, the NetWare network
operating system. Another combination, of NetWare and Unix, made
possible by Novell's takeover of AT&T's Unix Systems Labs, would
make Novell the primary force in networked operating system
technology.

But the dream has turned sour. WordPerfect sales have atrophied,
flattening Novell's revenues and undermining the compelling logic
of building network versions of the products. Revenue growth has
fluctuated between -1% and 10% in recent quarters. At the same
time, NetWare 4, the two-year-old upgrade to the world's best-
selling network operating system, has been breaking records as
one of the industry's slowest selling software upgrades ever. And
rather than stand up to Microsoft, Novell has been forced into
retreat as NetWare has come under intense competitive pressure
from Microsoft Windows NT, which by many accounts is maturing to
match much of the unique networking functionality that previously
distinguished the Novell product.

                           THE REALITY

The upshot is that Frankenberg has been clicking the undo button
on almost all Noorda's major acquisitions in a desperate effort
to re-focus Novell on its core competencies in networking
software. Many of the very products that a year ago were going to
underpin the company's future, have now been sold off or are up
for grabs. The company has already divested itself of - or is in
the process of selling - businesses that when purchased cost
Novell close to $1.5 billion in shares and cash. Most notably,
WordPerfect and the Borland Quattro Pro assets, which it bought
for a combined sum of $965 million in mid-1994, are on the market
for an estimated $300 million; the rights to the Unix operating
systems, which came with its purchase of AT&T's Unix Systems
Labs, have been passed to Hewlett-Packard; and Novell's Unixware
Unix-on-Intel implementation has been sold to Novell's chief
competitor in the segment, Santa Cruz Operation.

James Tolonen, chief financial officer at Novell, claims that the
decision to sell WordPerfect was carefully considered and was not
a reaction to stock market sentiments: "When Frankenberg came on
board, he instituted his own strategy and decided to move away
from Ray's strategy of broadening our focus. Although he
initially supported Unix and WordPerfect, it became clear that
focusing on our core business was the best strategy."

Industry sources also point out that Novell is not quite finished
with shedding businesses and that its Appware division, which
produces software application development tools, is likely to be
dropped too. Tolonen said that several third parties had inquired
about purchasing the Appware business.

Novell has also backed out of several technology collaborations.
Most importantly it has quit its long-term involvement in
OpenDoc, an effort with IBM and Apple to build an object
communication architecture. As Gartner Group market analyst David
Cappuccio says, "Ray [Noorda] never saw a technology he didn't
like," and Frankenberg is having to live with the consequences.

                        POOR TRACK RECORD

That the WordPerfect and Unix acquisitions didn't work out is not
a surprise to some Novell observers who point out that Novell's
track record shows little success with takeovers. In his early
days at Novell, Noorda masterminded the acquisition of Santa
Clara Systems and Excelan - both of which came to little. Then
there was the acquisition of SoftCraft which failed to go
anywhere and was later resold to its previous owners. Digital
Research and its DOS clone DR-DOS was to have offered an
alternative to MS-DOS, another venture that failed to deliver on
its promise; then Unix Systems Laboratories from AT&T was to have
united the Unix world on a single standard to fight Microsoft
Windows and Windows NT.

But just how bad have things become at Novell? And how rock solid
is the networking base from which Frankenberg is trying to launch
a comeback? The answer to these questions is bound up with
Novell's competitive relationship with Microsoft.

                           THE LEGACY

Back in May 1994, when the former Hewlett-Packard veteran was
lined up as Noorda's successor, he stated that one of the primary
reasons for his interest in the position was the potential of
Novell's pending acquisition of WordPerfect. This was to have
been the final piece in Noorda's strategy to make Novell into
Microsoft's most formidable competitor.

Noorda did not see himself as someone obsessed with checking
Microsoft's expansion; rather he wanted to be seen as the man who
took action on behalf of an industry-wide resentment among both
vendors and customers against Microsoft's dominant position.
Noorda's public statements criticising Microsoft, and his efforts
to involve the Justice Department in an anti-trust investigation
of Microsoft, were all part of the crusade. It was to be his
legacy to the entire PC industry: Noorda would be hailed by
future generations as the man who stood up to Bill Gates.

Noorda's anti-Microsoft strategy has become an expensive failure,
primarily because "it is difficult to be anti-anything because
you're not selling anything", Dataquest analyst Paul Cubbage
points out.

According to Cubbage, Unix could have been the company's best bet
in taking on Microsoft. However, calling Unix the "Yugoslavia of
software", Cubbage says the different Unix backers could never
get their act together to challenge Microsoft on the desktop.
"Novell also threw away the Unix brand name, something it could
have used to great advantage in marketing," Cubbage adds.

Noorda is receiving much of the blame for Novell's wrong turn in
its business strategy, but his greatest weakness was, as one
industry insider says, that "he had a huge ego and wanted to be
as big as Bill Gates". Noorda's decisions were also emotionally
based. He not only disliked Bill Gates but harboured long-
standing resentments against other industry figures such as Lotus
Development chief Jim Manzi. Manzi earned a place on Noorda's
enemies list after the failure of efforts to merge Novell with
Lotus in 1990.

When Novell was discussing the acquisition of WordPerfect, Manzi
was also in the bidding for the $600 million word processing
giant, so Noorda saw an excellent opportunity to hit back at both
Gates and Manzi with one blow - albeit a questionably expensive
one.

Delaying his retirement until he could hand-pick a successor,
Noorda finally left Novell, confident that Frankenberg would
execute the grand plan. Yet within two weeks of Noorda's
departure, Frankenberg was sitting down with Bill Gates in
Seattle, trying to arrange a cease-fire and to end a stream of
customer complaints about how the lack of co-operation between
the two companies was affecting product compatibility and
creating technical support problems. Perhaps it is not surprising
that Frankenberg did this, he was at one time HP's Microsoft
liaison and the HP philosophy was that working with Microsoft has
always been good for business. Even Frankenberg, in various
interviews, stated that he thought Noorda had "gone too far [with
his] overfocus on Microsoft".

Part of Novell's grand plan with its acquisitions was to produce
"Super NOS". This was to be a close integration of NetWare
integrated with Unix to provide an application server - alongside
the NetWare PC LAN file and print server - that would compete
directly with Windows NT. Alongside that, the WordPerfect and the
Borland applications would provide a tightly integrated and
network-capable suite of powerful office applications,
PerfectOffice, that would compete with Microsoft's Office suite.
Add the OpenDoc software development technology being developed
with Apple Computer and IBM, and that would result in a broad
software portfolio capable of competing head-to-head with
Microsoft in operating systems, networking, applications and
applications development tools. The trouble was that it placed
the company in the path of the Microsoft steamroller and it
couldn't move quickly enough into a competitive position.

"It was a reasonable strategy but Novell just couldn't bring it
all together," says Stan Schatt, LAN research director at market
research company Computer Intelligence Infocorp (CII). "There was
never a strong Unix voice inside the company. And it was all 18
months too late. I still think that it was a wrong move to get
rid of Unix."

And although Novell's shareholders did not like the WordPerfect
acquisition, Karl Wong, software industry analyst at Dataquest,
says the company should have decided to hang on to WordPerfect.
"Novell capitulated to Microsoft too readily. It still had the
prospect of doing reasonably well with Windows 95 versions of its
software suite," he says.

But the advent of Windows 95 was the last straw. The legacy of
not co-operating with Microsoft meant that WordPerfect developers
made slow progress in readying a Windows 95 version of their
software. Even now it is not due to ship until early next year.
As a result, the launch of Windows 95 in August prompted a
nosedive in WordPerfect software sales as customers turned first
to the Microsoft Office suite, knowing it would work well in the
Windows 95 environment. WordPerfect revenues have dwindled ever
since. During the third quarter, applications software sales fell
35% to $86.1 million, representing only 16% of Novell's total
revenues. In the fourth quarter that was closer to $60 million,
or 13% of revenues, compared with $134 million, or 28% of
revenues, a year earlier.

That raised the 'For Sale' sign on all WordPerfect applications,
with one exception, GroupWise. This is the groupware package that
Novell still sees as a strategic component in its future network
focus.

But industry observers point out that there may be few keen
buyers of a business that is competing against Microsoft's 90%
market share of the $720 million office suite market. According
to Dataquest, Novell's PerfectOffice suite and IBM's Lotus
Smartsuite split the remaining 10% almost equally. Only a few
months ago, Frankenberg was talking of aiming for a 20% share of
the office suite market - inspired by an integration of the
applications with networking and groupware.

Unable to let go of his dream, Noorda, now in his early
seventies, is bidding again for WordPerfect through his
investment firm Canopy Technologies. Other potential buyers
include IBM, which might want to strengthen its SmartSuite set of
office software with a word-processing package that has a huge
installed base compared with the less than pervasive
AmiPro/WordPro. There is also a possibility of a management
buyout by WordPerfect executives.

Although shareholders applauded the news of the WordPerfect sale
by boosting Novell's share price, the move does not hearten
industry observers who question whether it is part of Novell's
carefully thought out business strategy or if it is a knee-jerk
reaction designed to revive the company's flagging share price.

The question is: was Novell pushed by the stock market to dump
WordPerfect or did it move of its own accord? Until fairly
recently, Frankenberg and Sheldon Laube, Novell's chief technical
officer, maintained their commitment to WordPerfect in interviews
and public speeches.

"You would have thought that if Novell had planned to sell
WordPerfect, it would have prepared it a bit better and not
chased away some of the top WordPerfect people," says David
Coursey, editor of PC Letter. "It diluted the WordPerfect
franchise which will make it harder to sell."

The other part of Noorda's anti-Microsoft strategy, OpenDoc, has
also faltered. Novell has passed the development of the Windows
version of OpenDoc to IBM - a move that worries some analysts.
"We know how quickly IBM can get products to market," says
Cubbage of Dataquest. "OpenDoc seems pretty much brain dead right
now."

                          THE NT THREAT

But dropping Unix, WordPerfect and OpenDoc still does not remove
Novell from the path of Microsoft. Windows NT, Microsoft's server
operating system, is rapidly gaining momentum, according to Jesse
Berst, editor of Windows Watcher newsletter: "NT is getting
better with improved file and print services." With Microsoft
pitching NT as a superset of NetWare functionality, Novell has an
increasingly difficult task in showing where it adds value.
"NetWare is still a better product in what it does, but companies
installing NT get the file and print services thrown in free of
charge," points out Berst.

"Windows NT is a serious threat to Novell," says Dataquest's
Wong.

Dataquest estimates that Microsoft will ship 1.9 million Windows
NT licences in 1995, compared with Novell's 1.3 million or so
licence sales of NetWare. What is not clear, however, is the
percentage of new NT sites that would have previously become
NetWare users or what percentage of NT sales are actually NetWare
knock-outs.

Computer Intelligence's Stan Schatt, for one, doesn't see a
dramatic move to NT within NetWare's installed base. "We conduct
more than 30,000 user phone calls each month and there is nothing
there that shows a big trend from NetWare to NT. NetWare has
about 66% of the [network operating system] market but prospects
for significant growth [beyond that] are doubtful. It will lose
market share slowly, just as any vendor with such a dominant
share can expect to."

Dataquest's Cubbage sees NT helping to grow the entire network
market which will mean that Novell's core business should grow
with the market even if its total market share declines. "NetWare
is a very good product and, as our analysis of the costs of
running networks shows, NetWare does pretty well, mainly because
Novell has ensured that support personnel are well trained,"
Cubbage says.

Dataquest reckons that about 20% of the NetWare user base will go
to NT rather than NetWare 4. In fact, where NT is displacing a
current system, in 80% of cases it is knocking out IBM's OS/2,
says the analyst group. Others agree: "Novell will remain the
dominant provider of network operating systems," says Forrester
Research, "while NT will become a critical applications
platform."

"With NT's growing popularity, companies are wondering if they
can't just install NT, eliminate Novell, and move forward.
Forrester believes the answer is no. NetWare is a network
operating system while NT is a server operating system. These are
very different animals.

In contrast to its previously aggressive tone regarding Microsoft
products, Novell has adopted a more realistic outlook on the
market regarding NT. "NT is a good product and we believe it will
be very successful for Microsoft," states Novell chief financial
officer Tolonen.

But it is not an either/or decision for customers - NT is more of
a data and applications server; NetWare is a network server. "We
see a world in which there are heterogeneous networks with
different operating systems and different hardware platforms,
with NetWare providing the 'glue' that binds them."

The strategy is to co-exist in the market with Microsoft - and
anybody else who emerges - and concentrate on Novell's focus on
its core network business. To that effect, Novell is working on a
version of NetWare for Windows NT, due early next year.

But what is the potential for that core networking business in
the years to come. Over the past two years, Novell has
encountered some difficulties in getting customers to switch
their networks to its latest technology, NetWare 4. Even now, its
most recent figures show sales of NetWare 3.1 outweighing those
of NetWare 4 , with 3.1 sales accounting for about 55% of NetWare
revenues compared with 45% for 4.1.

One reason is that NetWare 3.1 provides an adequate level of
functionality for a large number of its customers, and another is
that the initial upgrade, NetWare 4.0, had some technical
problems. These have been fixed and the product is now described
by analysts as robust.

To encourage a drift towards NetWare 4.1, Novell has cut its
price by 25% and now says that sales are exceeding those of
NetWare 3.1. That helped its networking software revenues grow by
17% during the first nine months of fiscal 1995.

Novell is also focusing on expanding the reach of NetWare through
NetWare Directory Services (NDS), although this key component has
far from fulfilled its promise yet. NDS is at the heart of
Novell's 'smart network' concept. It keeps track of NetWare users
- where they are, what they need - and automatically links users
to requested information and services no matter where these
reside on the network. In addition, extensions to NDS could be
used to manage licensing and use of applications.

Another important direction for Novell is to create virtual
networking with NetWare, to allow 'pervasive computing'. Through
NetWare Connect Services (NCS) it seeks to allow the linking of
more than 2.5 million NetWare networks into a single global
network. Novell has teamed up with AT&T to enable separate
NetWare networks to be connected through AT&T network services
and to allow NetWare users access to the Internet. Novell claims
that 15 telecommunications companies around the world have
committed to offering NCS services over the coming year. The
long-term goal is also to extend networking services into the
home through NetWare-enabled cable TV boxes and telephone
connections that could control and monitor appliances within the
home.

Key to this strategy is the development of an embedded, small-
footprint (50 kilobyte) version of NetWare which can be contained
in an inexpensive chip and can control office machines as well as
being used to network and control home-based electronic
appliances and for applications such as car monitoring systems.
Called NetWare Embedded Systems Technology (NEST), this is how
Novell hopes to achieve its stated goal of having a billion
NetWare nodes by the year 2000 - up from 50 million today.

Part of NEST is a technology that enables data to be sent over
domestic electricity lines. This may open niche markets such as
remote monitoring of electrical power use in homes. NEST-enabled
cars, another proposed application, would be able to diagnose
problems and call up and schedule maintenance automatically.

"We don't see this as a niche market," says Glenn Ricart, senior
vice president of corporate research and development at Novell.
"We see this all as networking which is our number one business.
With our technology that can use power lines to transmit data, it
opens up a world of possibilities in the home so that household
appliances can be controlled through NetWare."

Xerox and Lexmark are a couple of major names cited by Novell as
OEM device manufacturers that intend to connect office and
consumer products to the NetWare networks. Currently, NEST
contributes about $1 million a quarter to the company's revenues.

Ricart also reveals that Novell has had talks with Sun regarding
Sun's Java computer language which could also offer a more
significant challenge to Microsoft because Java is platform
independent. "The trouble with Java is that it doesn't make use
of the network as much as it could. We are very interested in a
network-enabled type Java technology," Ricart says.

In addition, to help develop applications for its smart global
network, Novell plans to offer its Net2000 set of application
programming interfaces supporting C, C++ and Object Linking and
Embedding components plus popular software development tools such
as Visual Basic, Delphi and PowerBuilder.

There is also call for software that allows users on the network
to share work, which explains why, in shedding WordPerfect,
Novell hung on to the GroupWise groupware package. Groupwise has
an installed base of some five million users and is showing
revenue growth of 100% a year, according to Novell. The software
has twice the number of users of IBM's high profile groupware
package Lotus Notes. But GroupWise is also tightly integrated
with WordPerfect applications, and one without the other might
not be as attractive to customers.

"We will continue to work with whoever purchases the productivity
applications but the two products are sold separately anyway,"
points out Tolonen.

Novell's future directions are interesting but they are mostly
vaporware for now and the prospects of the new businesses
generating significant revenues could be two to three years away.
In the meantime, Novell is saddled with trying to raise revenues
from a customer base that is considering Windows NT, that is not
upgrading as quickly as it wants it to, and that will be less
than impressed by the company's ditching of so many of its
previously strategic products.

The medicine that Frankenberg has dished out may be bitter, but
analysts say it was very necessary. Frankenberg has changed the
perception of the company from one with a floundering strategy to
one that "now seems to have a definite direction," says Coursey
of PC Letter.

Frankenberg is still purging the Noorda legacy and rooting out
the remaining Noorda loyalists among the management. In doing so,
he has brought Novell almost full circle, back to where it was in
1993, and focused on its core NetWare business.

Despite the bad news on the application sales, Novell is a highly
profitable company with net income of about $300 million on flat
revenues of $2 billion. Tolonen sees better times ahead: "Our
core business grew in fiscal 1995 and we expect continuing
improvements, especially since we will not have the same drain on
resources with the sale of WordPerfect." He says NEST is already
showing small revenues and NetWare Connect Services will start to
bring in revenues in 1996.

While Novell analysts are generally supportive of the company's
renewed focus on its core business, the short-term prospects for
growing revenues are not encouraging.

"It will take time for Novell to develop its new businesses and
to produce revenues. NetWare 4 is selling well, although Novell
had to discount the price. But there will be substantial numbers
of customers that won't upgrade because what they have is all
they need right now," points out Schatt at Computer Intelligence
Infocorp.

But has Frankenberg's paring to the core of Novell's activities
made the company, wittingly or unwittingly, an attractive
takeover target. Industry rumours are linking Novell with IBM and
AT&T, or even network systems vendors such as Cisco Systems.

Bill Gates, for one, thinks a deal is pending: "Novell is
splitting itself in two. You have to ask why they split
themselves if they're not for sale," he told a Forrester Research
conference in November.

Certainly, any purchase of Novell would amount to the largest
ever software deal - by a factor of two. Even the waning of
Novell's shares in recent weeks still puts its market
capitalisation at about $6 billion. That is a hefty starting
price for any acquirer, but it can be weighed against the 60%
market share it would be buying, the $2 billion in revenues and
the $1.2 billion in cash that Novell has stashed in the bank.

Novell's challenge now is to rebuild its NetWare franchise and
take it into a network-enabled future where corporate networks
link with each other and virtually any electrical appliance could
be a NetWare node. But no one knows for sure how far away this
future is and if Novell has what it takes to get there. Its track
record on vision has not been the best. r Tom Foremski

            NETWARE VERSUS NT - THE NOVELL CHALLENGE

Novell's decision to pare back its business to a core of products
centred around its networking software prompts a critical
question: What are the competitive differences and how much
overlap is there between the Novell NetWare network operating
system and its aggressively-pitched rival, Microsoft's
server/applications operating system Windows NT? The fortunes of
Novell over the next half decade will rise or fall on the answer
to this question. If it can convince corporate customers that
NetWare adds compelling value to their networks - even if these
are NT networks - it will prosper. If NT becomes a superset of
NetWare - or is even perceived as such - Novell will struggled to
prosper.

For many analysts, it all boils down to the design foundation of
the two technologies. Network operating software is optimised for
certain functions; a server or applications operating system such
as NT is trying to address a different set of criteria. The
primary function of network operating systems - such as NetWare
and Banyan Vines - is to allow PC LAN workgroups to share files
and printers. But distributed environments have become more
complex. Such products have been evolving to offer additional
network services. Forrester Research identifies three important
areas:

* Global directory. Directories provide consistent naming of
users and resources across the network and thus the ability to
find and use servers, printers, applications and files no matter
where they are.
* Security. Network security handles authentication of the user
and manages user privileges across the various network resources.
* Management and administration. The ability to oversee the
entire network - and implement changes, additions and deletions -
from any point.

With the launch of NetWare 4, Novell added NetWare Directory
Services - "The brains behind NetWare that allow it to self-
discover and configure large-scale, distributed environments,"
says Forrester. In addition, Novell ManageWise provided a
seamless view of the network, desktop and user environment and
"superior management", adds Forrester. In comparison, NT has
basic file and print services, naming services and NT-to-NT
security. According to Forrester, Microsoft's focus on making NT
a competitor to major Unix servers from IBM and HP results in a
lack of focus on improving NT's networking capabilities across
multiple platforms. Other observations are that:

* The NT microkernel is tuned for running applications; NetWare
is designed for network services.
* NT has NetWare 3.x-like file and print services "with
diminishing performance", while NetWare offers fast distributed
file and print with native support for DOS/Win, Mac, OS/2, Unix.
* NT's current naming scheme is limited and relies on future
technology due with Microsoft's Cairo object environment,
scheduled for 1997/8; NetWare Directory Services are scalable and
robust, but difficult to extend.
* Microsoft's Systems Management Services product is designed to
manage Windows and NT desktops - not the NT environment, SNMP-
instrumented network devices or MS Exchange; NetWare integrates
management across network product protocols - SNMP, RMON and DMI.

For large corporate buyers "NetWare or NT?" is the wrong
question, says Forrester. Rather it recommends co-existence: "The
Global2000 need both." It suggests current NetWare 3.x sites
should use 4.1 for new LANs, and when 40% of sites are running
this newer environment, there is a clear business case in terms
of reduced administration and value-added services for upgrading
the remaining 3.1 LANs to 4.1. For those fixed on an NT strategy,
Forrester suggests users should pressurise Novell to port NDS to
NT - or hope that Microsoft buys Banyan and integrates its
Streettalk directory services with NT.

COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNet
January 01, 1996

                         CROWDED SKIES

Will attempts to build new, vast satellite networks capable of
providing telecommunications from any portable device on the
planet succeed?

If the plans of six newly formed international consortia come to
fruition, by the year 2001 there will be 1,012 new
telecommunications satellites orbiting the Earth. Putting them
there will cost at least $20 billion - a massive figure but one
likely to be dwarfed by the tens of billions it will cost to
maintain and run them, and to build a related terrestrial
infrastructure.

The purpose of this new fleet of spacecraft, which because of
their low altitude will keep burning up in the atmosphere, is to
provide portable voice, data and 'multi-media' telecommunications
to people anywhere on the planet. If it all works, a user of a
portable telephone or a personal digital assistant (PDA) will be
able to make or take international phone calls, exchange urgent
data files or roam the Internet, even if they are travelling
through the remotest parts of China or trekking across
Antarctica.

The technological challenges - viewed by many scientists as
highly ambitious - are being tackled almost entirely by private
companies, with little governmental involvement (some governments
are hostile to the idea). The companies involved, including
Motorola, McCaw Cellular, Loral Space Systems, Orbital Sciences
and Bill Gates (of Microsoft), foresee huge revenues from
satellite-based mobile telecommunications - as much as $150
billion a year according to some estimates. The difficulty and
cost of putting the infrastructure in place, along with the
relative freedom from national telecommunications regulations,
makes the prize even greater. Any company that establishes a
clear lead may see its revenues rocket into orbit along with its
satellites.

                    TAPPING THE PHONE MARKET

The market does not require the widespread adoption of new
technologies such as PDAs or cheap, portable Internet terminals -
although they will drive demand for anywhere-to-anywhere
communications. The suppliers have judged that the current
addiction to mobile telephones will create massive demand for
worldwide bandwidth. The use of mobile telephones is accelerating
rapidly across the world; this year the number of phones in use
will grow by 58%. Analysts predict that by the year 2000 there
will be at least a billion mobile phones, compared with 50
million today.

But all of these users will be crammed into the big commercial
centres. At least 70% of the world's surface is beyond the reach
of today's mobile phones. The satellite consortia calculate that
if they can cover the whole planet, large numbers of business
people will pay dearly to remain in constant contact with their
colleagues as they roam the telecommunications desert.

This desert is not confined to the outback. Large areas of
advanced countries such as the US are beyond the reach of
conventional cellular communications; and it may never be
feasible to build terrestrial networks in many such places.
Currently the only way of bringing instant communications to
these regions is via satellites. And the only way of ensuring no
square metre is left out is by using dozens of satellites.

But the technical challenge is immense. Unlike the majority of
existing commercial communications and broadcasting satellites,
the new telecommunications satellites will not be put in
geostationary orbits (which make them appear to be fixed over a
single point on the surface of the planet). Instead, they will be
continuously circling the Earth from pole to pole at high speed
and at altitudes of between 400 km and 1,000 km. This is low:
conventional geostationary satellites are usually set at about
36,000 km. For this reason, these new satellites are said to be
low Earth orbit (LEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems.

The reason for flying so low is that the mobile
telecommunications companies need to reduce the time required for
the round trip of a radio message from ground to satellite. With
a geostationary satellite, it can take a few seconds; with an LEO
or MEO system, it can be reduced to a few milliseconds. That will
allow them to be used for real-time conversations which, the
network operators hope, will be indistinguishable from a normal
terrestrial or local cellular telephone call.

                         DOWN TO EARTH?

The low altitude brings a major disadvantage - the satellites are
not completely clear of the Earth's atmosphere which will
gradually slow them down and eventually cause them to crash to
Earth. Each satellite in the new constellations will therefore
have a finite life and will need to be replaced. Rocket and
satellite makers and owners of launch sites around the world are
looking forward to their first mass market and expect to earn at
least $31 billion from the business over the next five years.
This means satellite mobile telecommunications will never be
cheap.

The networks will also require complex switching. Each
constellation of satellites is analogous to a conventional
cellular telephone system except that the infrastructure of radio
transceivers is moving rather than fixed to the ground. In a
terrestrial network, the user moves past the transceivers which
pass a call from one to the other. With the satellite networks,
effectively the user is stationary while the transceivers orbit
above him, and hand over the conversation from one to the other
as each passes overhead and then moves out of range.

While a terrestrial cellular network may need several thousand
base stations to provide unbroken coverage over an area
equivalent to, for example, the UK, the number of satellites
needed to cover Earth ranges from a dozen to several hundred
(depending on the type and quality of service they provide and
the altitude of their orbits).

At least six LEO/MEO projects are underway. Between them they
will put more than 1,000 satellites in orbit, which will need to
be replaced continually. But these figures could change. More
consortia may enter the market, and some analysts believe that
some of the existing groups will be forced to merge their
projects to keep costs down. There are no plans for the satellite
networks to interoperate directly.

In 1994, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, made world
headlines when he announced his intention to develop a satellite
network with McCaw Cellular (CBR, April 1994). But the idea of
such a system is widely credited to the US company that has
already provided a large proportion of the world's terrestrial
cellular telephone networks and user terminals - Motorola.

                       MOTOROLA'S IRIDIUM

Motorola announced its intention to set up a universal mobile
communications network using a large number of low Earth orbit
satellites in 1990. It named its system Iridium. The name derived
from its original plan to use 77 satellites - the number of
electrons which orbit the nucleus in an Iridium molecule.
Subsequently Motorola found it could manage with 66 satellites.

Motorola's model is complicated. The Iridium satellites will
communicate with terrestrial subscribers through highly
directional antennas on the satellite that break each satellite's
2,000-mile wide 'footprint' into 48 overlapping zones or cells. A
packet switch aboard the spacecraft allows any cell to support up
to 256 simultaneous conversations. This means each satellite can
in theory support more than 12,000 conversations.

As an Iridium craft passes overhead, a caller on the ground
appears to move between the cells, taking about 9 minutes to
traverse the entire 2,000 mile coverage zone. An onboard digital
switch ensures any connections in progress pass to the next cell
within the antenna coverage pattern. As the edge of the coverage
zone approaches the subscriber's handset, it establishes contact
with the next spacecraft coming over the horizon. Linking to the
terrestrial network is also complex. Each satellite has switching
systems on board to bundle all their digital traffic and downlink
it to one of about a dozen terrestrial 'gateways'. These will
provide access to the wired public switched telephone network
(PSTN) using conventional telephony switching gear.

When a spacecraft cannot access a gateway directly (if it is out
of range), it can use side-looking antenna to pass the traffic to
adjacent satellites. In this way traffic can be relayed across
several satellites until it can be downlinked to a gateway.

Iridium has not faced only technical hurdles. When it was
announced, it made enemies of terrestrial cellular operators -
many of them major customers of Motorola - which saw Iridium as a
major competitor. Motorola has now opted for a 'one world, one
phone' policy. The idea is that a dual standard phone or portable
computing device will always search out the nearest terrestrial
digital cellular network first, and make a connection through
that. It will only talk directly to a satellite if no other
network is available. The same applies when trying to contact a
subscriber.

This policy shift could cost Motorola a significant slice of its
Iridium revenues - but gives it a clear, long-term advantage.
Many cellular operators have now signed up as Iridium partners.
Teledesic is also taking a similar line.

                         GATES AND MCCAW

If Iridium is ambitious, the plan hatched by two former school
classmates in Seattle, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Craig McCaw of
McCaw Cellular, must rate as one of the potential wonders of the
world. In fact, analysts have compared their Teledesic project
with the building of the Pyramids.

Gates is said to have approached Craig McCaw, founder of the US's
largest cellular telephone operating company, with the idea of
the Teledesic system in 1992/3. He was attracted by the Iridium
idea, but wanted to focus more on high-bandwidth data
communications. This means more satellites.

In fact, Teledesic will require no less than 840 satellites to
provide instant multimedia communications for users of personal
broadband terminals. Senior Teledesic executives say people who
want to use this type of personal communicator should be able to
do so on a whim wherever they are.

Teledesic seems to be an attempt to build a global equivalent of
existing public telecommunications networks in the sky. The plan
is to operate the satellites in flocks of about 40, in 21 polar
orbits ranging from 695 to 705 kilometres above the Earth. Each
satellite will cover a circular footprint about 700 kilometres
across, each overlapping the next by about 30%. The US, for
example, will be covered by 18 satellites at any time.

The network will require special terminals, because Teledesic
will initially use a microwave band to provide digital
connections of between 16 kilobits per second (kbps) and 2
megabits per second (Mbps). Even by landline standards this is
high bandwidth, but it can go higher. Teledesic aims to provide a
'space gateway' for corporate and other users with a minimum
bandwidth equivalent to today's T-1 lines (1.54 Mbps), rising to
1.2 gigabits per second, says Connie Kantor, Teledesic's director
of finance and administration. This could simultaneously support
mixtures of voice, video, image and data. Each satellite will be
designed to support up to 100,000 16 kbps channels at a given
time. The channels can be aggregated in 16 kbps increments to
support higher data rates.

The proposed Teledesic infrastructure would use the asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) technology now widely implemented for
multimedia networking. Individual users with fixed or mobile
terminals will access the constellation directly; large, fixed
subscribers with heavy traffic will use landlines to access large
local uplink facilities.

Teledesic's business model, partners and funding are less clear
than Motorola's. According to Kantor, Teledesic will not sell or
directly support user terminals, hand-held or otherwise. It will
sell small Earth gateway terminals that feed a terrestrial signal
to the satellite network. The goal is not to market services
directly to subscribers, but to provide an open network which
local organisations, such as telephone companies, can offer to
their subscribers.

Teledesic is not due to start until 2001, so its managers are
relaxed about the development of its technology and business
model. Kantor says: 'I get a dozen calls a week offering
finance.' It is in talks with telecommunications suppliers across
the world.

                           FOUR OTHERS

Four other proposed networks have a lower profile than Iridium
and Teledesic, are less ambitious, but may have a more immediate
impact. These are proposed by Globalstar, Odyssey, Orbcomm, and
I-CO. Technically, they are more like Iridium than Teledesic.

Globalstar, devised by Loral Space Systems Inc, will use 56
satellites orbiting above Iridium at 1,400 kilometres. These will
use a simple radio transmission technique known as code division
multiple access (CDMA) to deliver low-cost, cellular-equivalent
global telephone services. CDMA allows several users to occupy
the same radio channels without interference. Each satellite can
handle 1,000 calls at a time.

Globalstar's operators expect to earn a large portion of their
initial revenues by providing essential telephone services in
remote areas and developing countries that have no
telecommunications infrastructure. They calculate that half the
world's population lives more than two hours away from a
telephone.

A significant part of Globalstar's plan is to develop free-
standing solar powered public telephone booths in remote places.
Initial services will include cellular-grade voice, fax, and
9600-baud data transport services. This will clearly not be
sufficient for more advanced data networking needs.

Of all the networks, the simplest service, and the one closest to
being operational, is Orbcomm. This is aimed at a gap in existing
markets. Developed by Orbital Sciences Corp of Dulles, Virginia,
and Teleglobe Inc of Montreal, it is a micro-satellite-based two-
way messaging system. The system is relatively inexpensive to
deploy because it uses Pegasus, a low-cost launch vehicle
developed by Orbital. This can be carried to a high altitude by a
conventional aircraft, then launched. It can place a 1,000 lb
payload into orbit for about $10 million.

The Orbcomm satellites are small, light and cheap. Each Pegasus
vehicle can carry eight into orbit at a time. That means three
launches will place a fully operational constellation of 24
satellites in space. Most populated portions of the Earth will be
in sight of one or two spacecraft. Orbital has eschewed
sophisticated microwave radio links in favour of VHF radio.
Within its 3,000 mile diameter footprint, six uplink channels
will carry digital data at 2,400 bits per second; a single 4,800
bits per second channel will handle downlink traffic.

The relatively low-rate bit streams will be used to carry short
packet messages to and from small, inexpensive mobile terminal
devices. These self-contained, hand-held units will have small
LCD screens, and keyboards for reading and writing messages. By
using inexpensive VHF radio technology and a low bit rate, the
cost of a terminal can be kept low. For machine-to-machine
communications, the terminals can be fitted with serial ports to
interface with computers. Orbcomm is behind schedule, but should
begin operating in mid 1996.

Fewer details are known about two other proposed satellite
networks. One of these is proposed by I-CO, a consortium
supported by several telecommunications companies and Inmarsat,
the UK-based organisation that supplies satellite-based
navigation and communication services to shipping. The I-CO
network aims to provide services to airlines and ships. This
network will be based on medium Earth orbit satellites, which
will slow response times but increase coverage and reduce costs.

Another network was recently announced by TRW in conjunction with
Teleglobe. Details are sketchy, but it will be an MEO system,
using 12 satellites. Because of delays, this will reduce its
appeal to voice subscribers. TRW, the US electronics giant, has
been awarded a $2.28 billion contract to build hand-held
terminals.

                       WILL THEY TAKE OFF?

On paper, each of the proposed networks is technologically
plausible. But politics come into play. Each of these latter-day
merchant adventurers sets out to transcend jealously guarded
national government prerogatives and controls. Details such as
the granting of licences to operate, the approval of equipment
and the allocation and administration of radio frequencies must
be ironed out. Delays are seen as inevitable.

The liberalisation of telecommunications operations is proceeding
at some pace in North America and parts of Western Europe, but
state monopolies still prevail in the greater portion of
territories that the 'LEOsat' operators say need their services.

Most of the consortia have tried to get the support of public
telephone companies, but these partnerships may prove fragile.

At the same time terrestrial telecommunications technology is
developing rapidly. Terrestrial radio systems that can bring
services to remote rural areas quickly and for a relatively low
one-time investment are available. And in the developed world,
developments in optical and broadband radio networks are ready to
be deployed widely, which could undermine Teledesic.

The companies and consortia involved say they have well-thought-
out commercial plans. It remains to be seen if these are
technically feasible. Next they must find customers, despite
improving and increasingly cheap terrestrial systems. Finally,
they must face the problems of regulation, political debate,
environmental arguments and inter-company disputes.

              DISARRAY IN THE DISK DRIVE BUSINESS

Demand for disk drives is growing rapidly but wafer thin margins
and fierce competition mean few suppliers are making money. The
operating pressures are leading to widespread consolidation and
restructuring.

In August this year, William Miller, chief executive of Quantum,
the worldwide unit leader in the hard disk drive industry, quit.
After three and a half years of the unrelenting pressure of
running a major disk drive company, he wanted out.

Two months later, he was followed by Robert Maeser, president and
general manager of Quantum's High Capacity Storage Group. For
Maeser, a 30-year stint in the industry which even other computer
executives view as 'excessively turbulent', had taken its toll on
his health.

But it is not only individuals that are dropping off the pace.
According to figures from Disk/Trend Inc, storage industry
analysts, at the beginning of the decade there were 57
manufacturers of rigid disk drives worldwide. Today, there are 24
and falling.

Even among the top tier suppliers, the pressures are immense.
During the past weeks, Seagate Technology, the number two
supplier, has announced the acquisition of Conner Peripherals,
and Maxtor, the number five supplier, has announced its takeover
by the Korean electronics group, Hyundai. All are re-evaluating
their business models in the pursuit of greater operating
efficiencies.

                         BOOMING DEMAND

Demand for disk drives has never been greater. According to
Disk/Trend, 87 million disk drives will ship this year, up from
70 million in 1994, an increase of 25%. Total shipments for 1996
will be over 100 million.

Driving that demand is the boom in the PC industry and
particularly in consumer PCs. "The single most important trend
[in the disk drive industry today] is the rapid growth of the
consumer PC market. Consumer systems are 40% of US PC sales and
today and 30% of worldwide sales but they are growing twice as
fast as the rest," says Marlin Miller, marketing director of
Quantum. Consumer sales are so important because home PC users
put heavy demands on storage. While the average corporate storage
entry point is 400 Mb (megabytes of storage per PC), says Claude
Barathon, president and managing director of Quantum Europe, the
average consumer entry point is 1 Gb (gigabyte). "Games and CD-
ROMS are incredibly storage intensive," he says.

But even in the corporate market, the storage opportunities are
immense. "There are 180 million PCs installed. Half of those are
386 processor-based machines or older and have less than 120 Mb
of storage. What a market," says Barathon. In addition, midrange
and high-end systems, such as IBM mainframes, are increasingly
using arrays of commodity disk drives, rather than specialist
high capacity drives.

Chuck Haggerty, CEO of Western Digital, is equally enthusiastic.
The desktop PC and mobile system market amounts to 81 million
drives today but will be up to 180 million by 1999, he says. "By
1999, we will ship two disk drives to every PC."

                       FINANCIAL PRESSURE

But few suppliers are managing to turn this escalating demand
into growing profit. The problem is that even though disk
capacities are being pushed up at rates of 60% per year as
manufacturers struggle to keep up with user demands, drive prices
are falling fast. The value of the worldwide disk industry in
terms of revenue rose by just over 10% to $25.7 billion in 1995,
according to Disk/Trend, but will fall to $25.3 billion in 1996.
"Over the past year and a half, the industry has seen a 50% price
decline, slicing 20% a quarter [off prices]," says Bob Patent, a
storage analyst with IDC and former operations manager for
Quantum.

This fall in profitability is a direct result of the collapse in
disk drive prices. As competition has intensified, margins on
single platter disk drive products have been declining year on
year and, according to some, are down to an unsustainable 10%
from the high-teens back in 1994.

The pursuit of capacity is pushing all suppliers towards the
delivery of 'multiplatter' drives. Few suppliers are still
investing in one-platter technology - most are concentrating on
two-platter and three-platter drives where the margins are closer
to 18% and 30% respectively. But even here, the overall trend is
downwards.

To add to supplier problems, the rate of technology change in the
disk drive industry, and hence the demands on research and
development, are increasing. "The world used to run on 18-month
technology cycles," says Patent. "We are still near that at the
high-end but in the massive desktop PC sector we are down to six
to nine months between upgrades. The PC vendors would like it to
be six months."

This shortening of product lifecycles has led to severe inventory
problems, with suppliers repeatedly getting caught with the wrong
capacity disk drives at the wrong time. The pressure to dump
obsolescent stock has contributed to the overall margin erosion.

Now, a fresh round of industry consolidation has many predicting
a levelling off period for the industry. "Over the last 10 to 15
years we have seen lots of high peaks and low valleys but," says
Haggerty, "market forces are stabilising. Five years ago there
were 13 to 14 players. Now there are four or five - that brings
stability."

Others are less optimistic. With the rate of technology change
increasing and prices still falling, "1996 will be a difficult
year," says Marlin Miller of Quantum. Success for the remaining
market contenders is far from guaranteed and further
consolidation looks likely.

                             SEAGATE

With 1995 revenues of $4.5 billion, Seagate is the number one
disk drive supplier in terms of revenue and the most profitable.
Its pending acquisition of the ailing Conner Peripherals for just
over $1 billion is set to completely alter the landscape of the
storage market, putting the company way out ahead with combined
revenues of over $7 billion and a 38% market share by units.
"Seagate is now the unchallenged market leader," says Patent.

Key to Seagate's future strategy is a move away from complete
dependence on disk drives, although the majority of revenues
($4.3 billion) are still derived from this sector. In 1993, Al
Schugart, founder of Seagate and an industry stalwart, hired
Steve Luczo, a high-flying investment banker, to spearhead
Seagate's diversification programme. Schugart's target was to add
$1 billion to revenues in new storage hardware, $1 billion in
components and $1 billion in software.

According to Luczo, initial discussions with Finis Conner,
founder of Conner and joint founder of Seagate with Schugart,
centred on Conner's software business but, says Luczo, "Over
three or four weeks conversations expanded to incorporate the
whole company. The more we talked about it, the more it fitted."

Conner was a company in desperate need of a lifeline. Despite
being the industry leader back in 1992, before a particularly
deep 'valley' period, by the beginning of 1995 Conner's market
share had been whittled down to 13% by volume. For the nine
months to October, Conner's net income, already low, fell from
$65.5 million to $36.4 million, despite a rise in revenues from
$1.77 billion to $1.94 billion.

"The company was resource constrained and had been losing money
for several quarters," says Jim Porter of Disk/Trend. "It [the
buyout] is a good deal for Conner shareholders. The opportunity
for growth at Conner had come to a halt. The executive management
has been a revolving door for the last two years."

The two companies appear well matched. Seagate has focused on the
high-performance enterprise end of the market while Conner
specialises in low cost drives and also brings a portfolio of
tape products. Seagate shipped eight to nine million disk drives
at the high-end last year, while Conner shipped 11 million on the
desktop. In components, Seagate is a major supplier of heads
while Conner is strong in media. Together, they have a strong
manufacturing base which will help both in the struggle to keep
up with product demand.

Competitors have been publicly supportive of the deal, saying it
will help to stabilise pricing across the industry. Conner has
been very aggressive on pricing over the last year, forcing other
vendors to cut prices accordingly. Under Seagate ownership,
prices are expected to float up, reducing the margin pressure on
all suppliers.

Haggerty of Western Digital also thinks that Seagate's 38% market
share will be quickly eroded as customers re-evaluate their
supplier relationships. "I believe the Seagate/Conner deal will
create an opportunity rather than a problem," says Haggerty.
"There are a lot of customers out there which do business with
either Seagate, Conner or both and a number of them have come to
us looking for an alternative supplier."

Luczo dismisses these arguments, saying the acquisition of Conner
will give Seagate unparalleled strengths. "Drives are getting
harder to make, so a strong financial base, broad product line
and ownership of technology and manufacturing processes is
increasingly important. We are the only company to have all
that."

But even with the advantage of size, Luczo doesn't expect market
conditions in the disk drive industry to get much easier. "With
OEM [supplying to manufacturers], you are not sitting next to
final demand so there is an inventory risk and, where there is an
inventory risk, there will always be tough pricing. Business
won't get easier."

He is confident, however, that Seagate will be able to continue
posting good results. "Our operating model shows good profit on a
20% to 22% margin and that is sustainable." For the first quarter
of 1996, Seagate announced record revenues up 55% to $1.45
billion, with net income up from $22.5 million to $108 million.

                             QUANTUM

The company most directly affected by the Seagate/Conner tie up
is Quantum, the clear leader in desktop PC drives. Quantum
shipped 16 million drives in 1994 and expects to ship a
staggering 20 million this year, but its financial performance
has been patchy. While revenues in its latest quarter were up
from $726 m to $1 billion, falling margins and problems at the
high-end, along with a $32 million 'faulty goods' rebate to an
unnamed PC maker, meant net income slipped from $48.6 million to
$22 million.

One of Quantum's weaknesses has been its dependence on the
fiercely competitive low-margin desktop drive business and, for
this reason, the company's focus over the past year and a half
has been to extend its business in the more lucrative high-end
sector. To this end, Quantum bought Digital Equipment's Avastor
storage business back in 1994 and has been working to integrate
it ever since. The pressure of doing so is believed to have been
one of the key factors behind the resignation of chief executive,
Bill Miller.

Miller's replacement, 37-year old Michael Brown, former head of
the desktop part of Quantum's business and an 11-year company
veteran, is clear about the importance of the high-end. "Although
maintaining our leadership position in the desktop market is
important, our future growth and success depends more on on our
ability to grow and strengthen other areas of our business," he
says.

Quantum now claims a 22% share of the high-end storage market, up
from 7% before the Avastor acquisition. But, according to
analysts, the impact on the bottom line has not yet been
positive. "Quantum had lots of problems with Avastor and is still
losing money on the disk side," says Porter. "It will be a year
before it is all straightened out."

In a bid to address the problem, Quantum has embarked on a
restructuring of its high-capacity business, including closing
the company's inherited manufacturing facility in Colorado
Springs. The vast majority of Quantum's manufacturing is carried
out by a third-party, the company's Japanese manufacturing
partner Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics (MKE). Barathon claims
this gives Quantum greater flexibility and more efficiency than
can be achieved with an internal manufacturing set-up. "Disk
drive makers have always been dependent on merchant suppliers,"
he says.

Barathon believes the blip in Quantum's business performance will
be short-lived, blaming it on the product shortages affecting all
suppliers and a product transition back in May. The company's
goal going forward is to "get back to the number one spot". "We
are growing faster than the industry and prices are stabilising.
All the elements are in place," says Barathon.

Others believe the company has more hurdles to overcome.
Quantum's margins have gone from 18% to 13%, says Chris Brown,
director of distribution and retail channels at Maxtor.

But Marlin Miller of Quantum is confident that the company can
turn it around. "One of the key factors is to have a low expense
to sales ratio. Our desktop business operates at around 10%," he
says. With Michael Brown's continued focus on operating
efficiencies, says Porter, "They'll get it right in the end."

                               IBM

With Quantum struggling, the number two market spot behind
Seagate is potentially attainable and the man eager to fill the
gap is Dave Ernsberger, head of worldwide OEM sales for IBM's
storage systems division (SSD).

IBM only got into the OEM disk drive industry four years ago but
says it has already built up annual revenues of $2 billion,
growing at 50% a year, twice the pace of the rest of the
industry. "What other company could have done that?," says
Ernsberger. "Our technology is terrific. There is a huge demand
for our products. The only question is, how quickly can we
expand?"

IBM claims to have built four million drives in 1993, eight
million in 1994 and expects to do 10 to 11 million this year.
Next year, says Ernsberger, will see another significant jump.
"We started off doing $1 OEM business to $7 internal. Today, we
do $6 OEM for every $4 internal. Next year, 75% of output will go
to OEM customers."

However, some analysts suggest that the focus of Jim Vanderslice,
newly appointed head of SSD, is shifting away from the OEM
business. "Vanderslice is more interested in getting the
mainframe business back from EMC," said one, referring to IBM's
attempts to recover market share in high-end, integrated
mainframe disk systems. Ernsberger disagrees, "The OEM business
is not at all on a back burner. My aspiration is to be the number
one player".

To do that, however, IBM will need to pitch in to the fiercely
competitive desktop drive business. Today, IBM operates only in
the mobile and high-end markets, commanding a healthy share in
both. In the mobile sector, its 1995 market share is expected to
be close to 40%. "In the near-term, you will not see us at the
low capacity points on the desktop, it is not where our strengths
are. We do want to be big in that area but, today, rather than
try and compete across all segments, we have chosen to build at
the high-end sweet spot."

Despite the narrow focus of its products, Luczo rates IBM as
Seagate's "most important competitor". "They are vertically
integrated - the owners of technology. To date, we have been just
a little leaner and a little faster."

One problem for IBM is what Luczo of Seagate calls the "I won't
OEM from IBM" attitude from PC makers. But while he thinks it
will always be a factor, "If they are the only ones supplying
technology, people will buy it."

                         WESTERN DIGITAL

Four years ago, Western Digital was a company that many analysts
were predicting would go out of business. But, over the last two
years, it has grown revenues to $2.1 billion and has increased
its market share in the desktop segment from 12% to 22.5%. "From
1993 to 1995 we saw a significant turnaround. Of all the disk
drive companies out there, we now have the strongest balance
sheet," says Haggerty. Part of that, however, is due to the sale
of Western Digital's multimedia products unit to Philips.

Like Quantum, Western Digital is doing much to try and decrease
its dependence on the desktop disk drive segment. It is working
on a 2.5 inch disk for the mobile market and has snapped up a
number of ex-IBMers to develop a high-end product line with
drives of 2 Gb, 4 Gb and 8 Gb, a segment in which it believes it
can do well. "Some of the firmware of our competitors is very
aged. Ours is based on completely new code," says Haggerty.

But Western Digital is in a unique position. It is the only
company left in the industry that doesn't own its technology or
have an affiliation to a larger partner, a position which some
suggest is unsustainable. But Haggerty says the company is far
from vulnerable. "Our plan is to be the asset management leader.
We did $2.1 billion with 7,200 employees, Seagate did $4.6
billion with 65,000 employees. Over 70% of our disk drive
components are common which means we can turn assets very fast."
Certainly, Western Digital has garnered a reputation as a market
maker, being the first to ship at new capacity points.

Western Digital logged its highest ever quarter shipment in the
summer when it shipped 2.8 million drives and, like many others,
Haggerty believes the Seagate /Conner deal will create
opportunity for even bigger growth. He is also expecting a let-up
on margins. "The pricing pressure was created by Conner and
Maxtor so that will now stabilise," he says.

But despite his buoyant mood, Western Digital's recent results
were below expectation. The company reported revenues of $558
million, up from $464.5 million in 1994 but net income fell
markedly from $34.7 million to $8.3 million, a factor Haggerty
puts down to the slow take-off of its new 1.6 Gb drive and
"greater than anticipated competitive pricing".

Despite Haggerty's insistence, Western Digital may yet end up as
part of a larger concern. "There is room for the industry to
consolidate a little further, " says Brown of Maxtor. We could go
from five players to four and the only company without a
connection to a bigger one left is Western Digital." IBM, Quantum
and Samsung have all been rumoured as potential buyers.

                         MAXTOR/HYUNDAI

The most recent consolidation in the disk drive industry is that
of Maxtor and Hyundai. In November, Hyundai announced that it is
to buy the remaining 60% of Maxtor and turn it into a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Hyundai America.

According to Chris Brown of Maxtor, the effect on the management
and culture of the company will be negligible. "Hyundai took a
stake in the company in 1994 and has taken an active role since
then. The fact they now own 100% of the company wont be foreign
to us."

Maxtor is by far the weakest of the top tier storage players.
"The company has been losing money every quarter and would have
been out of business one and a half year's ago were it not for
Hyundai's cash injection of $150 million. The acquisition was
necessary to keep the company going," says Porter. Over the past
five years Maxtor has lost $326 million on sales of $5.5 billion.
In its most recent quarter, Maxtor announced a net loss of $44.5
million on revenues of $281 million.

Now, however, Maxtor is talking as though it is about to be
reborn. "Western Digital has had the best time to market and has
been the market maker but this quarter, we are shipping more 1.6
Gbs than they are," says Brown. "Next quarter we will be the
leader in 2 Gb drives." Importantly, the company has also just
won a new OEM contract to supply Hewlett-Packard with drives.

But Hyundai's aspirations for Maxtor are much greater. In a
statement, Hyundai said, "We have a plan to become the world's
second biggest hard disk drive producer by the year 2000 and the
largest by the year 2005." The company plans to invest up to $1
billion in Maxtor over the next few years in order to grow sales
to $5 billion by the year 2000.

It is a sizeable goal and some industry observers are worried
that Hyundai will adopt tactical pricing strategies to try and
steal market share in the short-term. Haggerty disagrees.
"Hyundai will not tolerate loss of money for a sustained period.
They will execute changes to stabilise pricing" he says.

Luczo says attempts to buy market share would be pointless. "You
can't buy market share in this industry, it is too expensive. Or
if you do take losses to buy market share, you only get it for a
couple of years. You win market share in the long-term by having
the best products."

Hyundai has a reasonable chance of turning the company around,
says Porter, "but they need to equip the company with an up to
date product line to do so."

                            OUTSIDERS

"The ongoing consolidation of the disk drive industry is going to
make it increasingly hard for new players to come in," says
Miller of Quantum. But many of the Eastern electronics
conglomerates have other ideas. Companies such as Toshiba,
Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC are all active in the market and all are
keen to extend their market share. But only Fujitsu is trying,
once again, to take on the US disk drive suppliers head on.

"The Japanese players pulled out of the OEM disk drive industry
three to four years ago because they didn't want to play down at
the 40 Mb range," says Adam Harris, director and general manager
of Fujitsu Europe. As are result, companies headquartered in the
US now control 85% of the OEM disk drive revenues.

Now, following a $100 million investment in magneto-resistive
head technology and 16 months of concerted effort getting its
technology and manufacturing right, Fujitsu says it is ready to
get back into the mainstream with products aimed at both the
desktop and the high-end. The company has production facilities
in Japan, Thailand and, next year, a factory is planned for the
Philippines.

Despite all this, even Harris is aware that Fujitsu will struggle
to make it as a top tier supplier. "Sure, we are not going to
have 20% of the market next year but we plan to be producing 1
million drives a month by the end of 1996 and 1.6 million by June
97." Harris says Fujitsu is currently in 10th position with a 3
to 4% share and is already taking business from Quantum and
Seagate.

While Fujitsu looks unlikely to seriously trouble the disk drive
industry leaders for many years, if ever, the Korean electronics
group Samsung has joined with its compatriot Hyundai in making
some bold statements about its chances in the market. It has said
that it wants to be in the top five OEM disk drive companies by
the end of the decade.

Samsung has set about its task by ramping up a research and
development facility in San Jose and it is now shipping around
two to three million disk drives a year. But realistically, say
analysts, Samsung's only chance of gaining a secure foothold in
the disk drive industry would be to team up with a US company.
Despite rumours that Samsung was in the bidding for Conner before
Seagate stepped in, and that it has also showed an interest in
Western Digital, the most likely target, say pundits, is the
California-based Micropolis.

As the Hyundai/Maxtor deal demonstrates, the preferred strategy
of Korean industrialists is to buy companies cheap when they are
weak and invest heavily to bring them back to health. Micropolis,
which has just announced third quarter net losses of $17.5
million on turnover down 26% at $58.8 million, is certainly weak.
It is also exploring alternatives for separating the operation
and management of its drive and value-added systems businesses, a
move which, analysts say, could suggest that it is ready to sell.

It is doubtful,however, that the combined force of Micropolis and
Samsung could actually have much of an impact on the top tier
disk drive suppliers, but Luczo of Seagate will not write the
Koreans off.

"The Koreans will be tough competitors," says Luczo. "If you
think back to the DRAM (memory chip) days, lots of people said
'no way'. Here we are, ten years later, and they are the dominant
suppliers. My guess is the Korean competitors will be significant
- Hyundai for sure and Samsung maybe.

                         CLOSING WINDOW?

But there may not be much of a long-term. Many vendors and
analysts believe the life of magnetic disk drive technology is
already into the twilight years. By the year 2000, they say, new
types of technology will start to emerge as magnetic disks reach
their physical limits.

"The life of magnetic disk drive technologies only has another 15
years," says IBM's Ernsberger. Like many others, IBM is already
working on a number of successor technologies, including
holographic storage.

Until then, day-to-day life in the disk drive industry is likely
to remain a roller-coaster ride, only for those with a strong
constitution. "We will definitely keep seeing those peaks and
troughs," says Porter of Disk/Trend. But the heavy financial and
technology players will certainly find it easier to flatten some
of the bumps.

            SUN SETS OUT TO BURN WORKSTATION RIVALS

Sun put on a good show to launch UltraSparc. But should the
technology behind the aggressive marketing message alarm its
workstation rivals?

When Sun Microsystems launched its new UltraSparc workstations
last month, it did so with all the razzmatazz of a Hollywood
spectacular. While thousands looked on via satellite link-ups,
hundreds of influential guests from around the world crammed into
the "Ultradome" big-top tent in the grounds of Sun's Menlo Park
facility in California. They were treated to fireworks, films,
live music, dry ice and "shoot-outs" between Sun's new systems
and rivals from Hewlett-Packard (HP), Digital Equipment and
Silicon Graphics.

Sun's desire to put on a show was understandable. In the $18
billion a year Unix workstation business, new product
announcements, usually featuring a significant advance in
computing power, are almost weekly events. But Sun needed the
UltraSparc message to stand out: Sun executives can now openly
confess that for several years its technology has been gradually
slipping behind rivals. But now, they say, the new UltraSparc
models, based on Sun's "revolutionary" 64-bit processor design,
are not just an incremental improvement over previous models and
those of rivals, but a major and ground-breaking advance that
will have a significant impact on the Unix server and workstation
market.

Apart from increasing the raw processing power of its systems,
Sun has introduced what it says are two groundbreaking
technologies: new on-chip graphics capabilities, which reduce the
cost of computer manufacturing and increase graphics processing
power; and Ultra Port Architecture (UPA), a cross-bar switching
method, adapted from supercomputer design, which increases the
internal bandwidth of a computer. This is important because it
cuts down latency - the time that components spend waiting for
instructions.

"This is truly a great day for Sun. This announcement is more
than about hot-boxes or leapfrogging ... this is a new paradigm,"
said Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Company
(SMCC).

Bill Joy, one of Sun's co-founders, concurred: "This is the
biggest announcement since the first Sparc [processor] five years
ago, and possibly even since the founding of Sun 15 years ago."
The technology, they add, will initially benefit all those
companies, such as HAL, ICL, Cray and Amdahl, that build systems
around Sparc processors.

Sun's executives were naturally circumspect about what the
UltraSparc processors and workstations might do for the company's
already impressive financial results and share price. But Sun
clearly expects to recapture some of the workstation market share
it has lost in recent years. Last year, according to market
analyst company Dataquest, Sun's share of the Unix workstation
business fell by 2% to 36%.

Sun now says it will inflict serious damage on its workstation
rivals. Zander said users of Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics
and IBM workstations will now consider switching to Sun machines.
And marketing director Anil Gadre claimed that Sun's improved
high-end graphics and floating point performance will take Sun
into the visualisation, high-end mechanical computer aided design
and "infotainment" markets for the first time.

Sun's claims were endorsed by more than 50 application vendors,
pages of testimonials from customers who had taken part in its
beta-testing programme and a glowing appraisal of its prospects
in Business Week magazine.

                            UPHEAVAL?

All of this points to a major upheaval in the workstation market
and problems ahead for rivals such as Silicon Graphics, Digital
and Hewlett-Packard. Moreover, Sun hopes that it has finally put
an end to analyst speculation that the Sparc processor family
will not ultimately survive the high-volume assault from rival
processor manufacturers such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard
(working together on a new design), and IBM and Motorola
(PowerPC).

Certainly, financial analysts like what they are hearing. Buoyed
by recent results (first quarter revenues up 17% to $1.49
billion, net income up from $38 million to $85 million), the
delivery of the UltraSparc technology and Sun's invention of the
Java programming language, which could become an Internet
standard, Sun's share price has doubled since July.

But is all the optimism for Sun justified? Assessing the claims
of rival processor and workstation suppliers, even with the aid
of sophisticated benchmarks, is always difficult. While some
analysts believe Sun has made some major technical advances,
others - especially its rivals - believe that Sun's achievement
is one of having successfully caught-up, rather than having
initiated a revolution. As one executive at Hewlett-Packard puts
it: "Sun's technology is good, but it is nothing like as good as
its public relations."

                      TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

If Sun is merely playing catch-up with its technology, it would
still be important for the company and its major customers. A
year ago, analysts such as the Forrester Group were predicting
that, of the major processor families, the Sparc was the least
likely to survive.

But Sun is claiming that it has taken a leadership position in
three core areas: raw power; on-chip graphics; and UPA. If there
is to be a real change in the workstation market, it will be
because Sun's advances in this area are substantial and not just
incremental.

Unfortunately, the impact of the innovations is difficult to
assess. In terms of power, the 32-bit SuperSparc processor, which
Sun has been using for the past two years, clearly lagged behind
rival designs from Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics and Digital.
The new UltraSparc processors and workstations are, according to
the Specmark benchmark figures provided by Sun, marginally ahead
of rivals, are cheaper, and will be superseded next year by
faster models. And in the "shoot-outs" demonstrated by Sun, the
UltraSparc system outperformed rivals dramatically.

But Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics and Digital are crying
foul: they say that Sun is comparing its systems with older or
non-equivalent models from rivals; that Sun is using out-of-date
Spec92 benchmarks, rather than the Spec95 benchmarks introduced
this summer (Sun says the Spec95 benchmarks are not ready yet);
and, in any case, some of Sun's new models will not be available
until next year, by which time HP and Silicon Graphics will have
announced their new PA8000 and R10000 processors (respectively).

Even so, there is some grudging recognition that Sun is back in
the technology race. "I concede they are good products. But what
they have done is caught-up," says John Saw, a technology
marketing manager with Hewlett-Packard. And Andrew Cresci, a
marketing director with Silicon Graphics, says: "They are good
but not good enough."

What of Sun's other advances? A crucial part of its announcement
is the on-chip graphics - known as visual instruction set (VIS) -
which "greatly improves 2D and 3D graphics, image processing,
video handling and animation". According to Mark Tremblay,
computer architect for Sparc Technology Business, it is both
cheaper and more efficient to put the graphics processing into
the main processor. He says that performance for graphics
applications can be boosted dramatically - and disproportionately
to the Specmark rating of the system: "We see more and more
graphics going onto the CPU." Other chip makers will follow Sun's
lead, he says.

Although other processor makers such as Intel (with NSP) and
IBM/Motorola (on the PowerPC) are moving in this direction, the
industry leader in graphics - Silicon Graphics - is not
impressed. "In general, if you want to increase performance, you
do the graphics separately. If you want to reduce the cost, you
put it on the chip," says Cresci of Silicon Graphics. His
argument is that Sun's innovation has been well understood for
many years but that the leaders in graphics processing have
forsaken the cost advantages of on-chip graphics because of
performance trade-offs.

Jack Gold, an analyst with the Meta Group, agrees: "It's not the
same as having an accelerator card. I still think Silicon
Graphics will take the top spot at the high-end." But Sun claims
dramatic improvements in the price and performance of graphics
applications and analysts expect it to have some impact on
Silicon Graphics at the lower end of its product ranges.

Sun's third major innovation - UPA - falls more squarely in line
with developments in modern computer design. Most designers now
recognise that increasing the internal bandwidth of a system is
probably more important than raw processing power. Sun's
switching technology means that one bus, such as Intel's M-Bus,
is replaced by several.

An important advantage of the UPA is that several processors can
be linked far more effectively - making it easier to reap
performance advantages from multiprocessor systems. For this
reason, powerful new Sun servers, aimed at commercial
applications, can be expected next year.

Although rivals have expressed doubts about UPA - Silicon
Graphics in particular claims its multiple bus design is more
efficient - it seems likely that Sun's approach will be widely
followed, especially as it can lead to substantially improved
input/output and network performance.

                             VERDICT

Two years ago, Sun Microsystems was widely perceived to be in
long-term decline, especially because it had fallen behind on
core chip technology (CBR, October 1994). In fact, chief
executive Scott McNealy says people have always been negative on
the company. "It has been 13 years of people thinking we're
toast," he said recently.

In this context, Sun has made a dramatic recovery. "There has
been a good deal of speculation that Sparc is dead. Sun has
finally said, 'Yes, we'll be there at the 64-bit level'," says
Gold of the Meta Group.

Market analysts at IDC also believe Sun has regained credibility.
"The new Ultra workstations put Sun back in the high performance
game ... Sun is well positioned to maintain its number one place
for the next several years," says analyst Tom Copeland.

Few question that Sun should now maintain its leadership and that
the stated goal of HP's general manager Bernard Guidon, to
overtake Sun in workstation sales next year, now looks far harder
to achieve. But Sun's wider claims - that it has redrawn the map
of Unix computing - are more suspect. By the middle of next year,
all the leading processor/workstation suppliers, with the
exception of IBM, will have leapfrogged Sun in pure processing
power at least once. Although Sun may regain the lead again, it
will not necessarily hold it.

Gold of Meta says Sun's announcement has not completely killed
off long-term doubts over the future of Sparc, because its
volumes will always be smaller than those of the Intel/HP and the
IBM/Motorola combinations. But, he says, it will "give people a
nice, cosy feeling and keep them interested in the platform."

Sparc still accounts for 36% of the Unix workstation market, a
market share which Sun held in spite of a long period when it
lagged behind rivals in performance. While this is unlikely to
dramatically change in the short term, suppliers that do not
compete effectively with Sun's aggressive pricing and its
performance improvement are likely to fall behind. IBM, which has
no 64-bit processor, may be a more obvious victim than Silicon
Graphics.

Sun's high share price today probably owes more to its
positioning as the number one supplier of Internet systems, and
its emerging Java language, than the competitiveness of its
hardware. But the real significance of Sun's UltraSparc
technology may not be seen until late next year, when, alongside
its workstations, it starts pushing powerful new commercial
machines. In workstations, Sun is defending its lead; in
commercial systems, it has everything to gain.

For the past four years, Geoffrey Moore has been the unseen hand
guiding the strategies of many major computer companies.
Executives don't often like to boast that they are drawing
heavily on his consultancy or on his 1991 bestseller, Crossing
the Chasm, as they plot their companies' courses. But the leaders
at Sybase, PeopleSoft, Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), Unisys, Sun,
Lawson Software, Tektronix, Bay Networks, Tivoli, Cincom and
Documentum, and the two hundred others Moore has worked with,
have all incorporated his IT industry models into their thinking.

In Crossing the Chasm, Moore distilled the essence of why some IT
start-ups develop into major suppliers and others - many, many
more - crash and burn before they even have a shot at the
mainstream market. Putting the classic technology adoption
lifecycle bell shaped curve under the microscope, Moore noted
that there are distinct waves of purchasing in a technology
market: buying starts with 'innovators' who will try any
technology that gives them an edge, then the technology is picked
up by 'early adopters'. This is followed by a phase of early then
late mass market take-up that represents the hump of the bell
before conservative 'laggards' come round to buying and the cycle
tails off.

That picture fell short in its sophistication, in Moore's
opinion, because it implied a continuous progression. His
experience indicates that there are, in fact, distinct gaps
between the various stages of the technology lifecycle that
vendors have got to leap if they are to successfully ride the
technology curve.

Most importantly, the gap between early adoption and the early
mass market is so large that it warrants being seen as a 'chasm'.
Into that pit have dropped many promising technologies - CASE
(computer aided software engineering), artificial intelligence,
and pen-based computing, for example. Explaining the forces that
push some companies into the abyss and propel others on to the
mass market is what his first book was all about.

Influential as Chasm was, the analysis stopped at the far side,
leaving a yearning for a more complete picture of the market
beyond. What dynamics do companies encounter once they have
crossed the chasm? How do they cultivate and exploit a mass
market for their products? And how should their strategies and
structures change as their products climb up one side of the
lifecycle curve and slide down the other?

With the publication in October of Inside the Tornado - Marketing
Strategies from Silicon Valley's Cutting Edge, Moore completes
all the pieces of the picture, focusing on the mainstream market
stages "where all high-tech wealth is created".

Three phases of a technology's life exist in the mainstream: the
building up of market momentum, the 'Bowling Alley' in Moore
terminology; a hypergrowth phase, the 'Tornado'; and finally, a
phase of consolidation, Main Street, when the market shakes out
and the remaining players reap all the benefits of a strong,
stable market.

One of the most interesting sections in the book deals with the
build up to the Tornado. Moore is adamant that, in order for
companies to attain the momentum of sales that precedes the
Tornado, they have to adopt a Bowling Alley approach. Flying in
the face of many vendors' desire to scatter bomb the whole
market, Moore insists that the approach that is most likely to
lead to a product entering the Tornado involves companies
embracing a niche market focus in advance of the general
marketplace. Getting into vertical industry sectors, where their
products satisfy a compelling customer need, is a crucial build
up to Tornado sales, he believes. As one niche topples like a
skittle, its momentum makes knocking over adjacent ones easier.

That may all sound dry and theoretical. But each of Moore's
points, each high-level idea, is backed by multiple examples of
companies which have got it right and others that have faltered.

One illustration: PeopleSoft, the client/server business software
company, entered the market initially by attacking the wide-open
niche of human resources. The management team knew that the big
spend on client/server packages would come not from HR but from
more mainstream business applications like financial management
and manufacturing, but they saw that it would take time for the
market to feel comfortable entrusting such 'mission-critical'
systems to the new paradigm of client/server. An HR application,
on the other hand, represented a much less risky starting point
for customers. PeopleSoft staked out its turf in HR in the early
1990s and has been growing at 80%-150% ever since. True to
Moore's model, the company is now using that base as a
springboard to launch into financials and manufacturing
applications. Despite the formidable competition in client/server
applications from larger vendors such as SAP and Oracle,
Peoplesoft is strongly established in the market and well-poised
to go forward.

Applying the same Bowling Alley approach, Lotus did not initially
offer its Notes groupware software package to the broad
marketplace. Rather, it targetted niche markets - first
positioning the product as a global account management tool for
Big Six management consultancies, then as a customer services
aid, before eventually taking the product horizontal. The Notes
success story "is all traceable back to the cascade of niche
markets developing one on top of another," says Moore.

That process, certainly in Lotus' case with Notes, leads to the
Tornado. This is when a product switches from niche acceptance to
wide market take-up, as the mass of pragmatists follows the early
adopters. German software vendor SAP has been in that phase for
the past 18 months; inkjet printer makers had their Tornado in
1991 to 1993. But the rush of growth can sometimes de-stabilise a
company. Oracle in 1991 came close to bankruptcy, even though its
revenues had grown by 100% a year for over five years.

For companies that survive that period in the Tornado, there is
Main Street - a period when the sales of a given product reach
their peak, the shape of market settles down, a market leader is
clearly established and huge profits are made.

But these are just the dynamics: what Moore's book is all about
is how to survive and prosper in each phase. His thesis is that
the forces, the management style, the sales model all have to
change as companies enter the different stages of the market's
evolution. The forces that operate in the Bowling Alley argue for
a niche-based strategy that is highly customer-centric; those in
the Tornado push in the opposite direction towards a mass-market
strategy; then on Main Street market forces push back again
toward a customer-centric approach.

"The winning strategy does not just change as we move from stage
to stage of the lifecycle," says Moore, "it actually reverses the
prior strategy. The very behaviours that make a company
successful at the outset of the mainstream market cause failure
inside the Tornado and must be abandoned. And, similarly, what
makes companies successful in the Tornado cause failure and must
be abandoned once that phase of hypergrowth is past."

Notwithstanding its unmatched insightfulness, Moore's book is not
without its flaws. Its layers of mixed metaphor can be tedious,
and at times childish. Aside from the lifecycle categories of
Chasm, Tornado and Main Street, the book characterises competing
companies in a sector as gorillas, chimps and monkeys, while
illustrating their positions in the market as imperialists and
natives, explorers or 49ers, barbarians or citizens.

Four years on from its publication, Chasm continues to double its
sales every six months, with 3,000 new copies selling each week.
Tornado is a better book - more clearly written and more
comprehensively illustrated with real world examples. Tornado's
title is certainly a little crass, and for many shelf browsers it
may be taken for yet another vapid management pep talk. But, even
so, this is an important book which is likely to be in and out of
the desk drawer of technology company managers for the next half
decade.

                           THE HP WAY

Last month, Hewlett-Packard moved comfortably into third position
in the world systems vendor top 50. At current growth rates it
should overtake Fujitsu within two years and be chasing IBM for
the number one position around the turn of the decade.

Here is a company that has the midas touch in many of its chosen
markets - most notably in Unix servers and printers - and whose
growth is more akin to that of start-up. During fiscal 1995, HP
added $6 billion in product sales, bringing revenues to $31.5
billion.

This success is no accident. HP was the first mainstream systems
vendor to wholeheartedly embrace RISC and open systems, without
killing sales of its proprietary midrange server platform. It
built the laser and inkjet printer markets virtually
singlehandedly and, through clever production and price
management, has turned printers into its primary engine of
profitability. In doing so, it became one of the few American
companies to take on, and beat, the Japanese in a commodity
technology market.

Yet, while two or three books a year are published about IBM,
Microsoft, and Apple, and there is at least one text each
detailing the life and times of Wang, Data General, and Sun,
there is remarkably little inside information on life at HP. The
garage in Palo Alto, CA where the company was founded back in
1938, has been designated a California Historical Landmark and
labelled 'the birthplace of Silicon Valley', yet the day-to-day
events, characters, chance meetings and carefully manoeuvred
strategies that helped Bill Hewlett and David Packard build HP
are largely uncharted. Unfortunately, the memoirs of David
Packard, do little to change that.

The HP Way, rather than giving a detailed insight into the
momentous events that turned a small test and measurement
instrument company into a computing giant, reads like a gushing a
fairy tale. A young, fit, talented Stanford scholar, David
Packard, in love with technology and nature, meets a like-minded
spirit in the shape of Bill Hewlett. Encouraged by a benevolent
professor, the happy twosome unite to create a new technology
company with the goal to "make an important technical
contribution to the advancement of science, industry and human
welfare". Through hard work and endeavour, coupled with enduring
respect for employees and business partners, the company grows to
be one of the most successful in North America.

The end result is a worthy corporate bible for HP employees and
perfect inspirational reading for budding high school
entrepreneurs. But those who might hope to finally get an insight
into what makes HP tick will find Packard's book a disappointing
and frustrating read.

Many key events in HP history are only mentioned in passing and
the book offers tantalising facts without any discussion or
explanation. For example, Packard notes how, in the 1960s, HP
entered negotiations to buy Digital Equipment for around $25
million, but decided against it. There is no further explanation
and no comment on why the deal was rejected. Neither does Packard
discuss the repercussions of Steve Wozniak leaving HP after
Wozniak's blueprint for a personal computer was rejected. With
Steve Jobs, that blueprint built Apple Computer.

What Packard does major on is his philosophy of workforce
management. There is a detailed discussion of 'the HP Way', a
seven point mission statement drawn up by Hewlett and Packard
covering all aspects of company operation from profit and
customers to employees and citizenship. Packard explains why
policies such as 'management by walking around' and 'management
by objective - the antithesis of management by control' evolved
and how they are executed. "Success depends in large part on
giving responsibility to the level where it can be exercised
effectively, usually on the lowest possible level of the
organisation, the level nearest to the customer. Each person in
our company is important and every job is important."

What also comes across is the clear attempt to stifle management
egos, a factor that has certainly contributed to a corporate
personality marked by its humility and low profile. In a typical
anecdote, Packard recounts how he travelled with his financial
entourage to a meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on the day
of HP's initial public offering. Despite the momentous occasion,
Packard and his colleagues took the subway from their hotel,
ending up late for the stock launch due to a missed train
connection. "It never occurred to me to take a taxi," he says
proudly.

For sure, these company codes have been instrumental in shaping
HP's success. But where is the discussion of the brilliant
product breakthroughs and of the key management decisions and
figures that propelled the company into market leadership
positions?

This book is less of a company history and more an investigation
of the moral and social beliefs of Packard. While there are many
corporate guidelines in The HP Way that managers today may wish
to emulate, others are now thoroughly outmoded and simplistic.
Packard concludes by saying, "Everywhere I look I see potential
for growth, for discovery far greater than anything we have seen
in the twentieth century." This book does not really throw any
light on how the HP corporate machine will work to exploit those
opportunities.

                   I SING THE BODY ELECTRONIC

When Tracy Kidder's The Soul of the New Machine appeared in 1982,
it established a blueprint for a certain type of technology book.
A writer, usually a journalist and almost always non-technical,
would spend a year or so in the company of a team of people who
were developing a technology product. The books are the written
equivalent of a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary, recording the
trials, emotions and turmoil of a group of people working against
time to develop an innovative product.

Kidder's was a Pulitzer prize winning account of the epic effort
to design and build Data General's first 32-bit computer. In I
Sing the Body Electronic - A Year with Microsoft on the
Multimedia Frontier, Fred Moody comes close to Kidder's
achievement. While Moody does not aspire to the almost poetic
style of Kidder's original, his book is a rigorously honest and
fascinating account of a year in the life of a Microsoft
development team.

Moody had almost unchallenged access to the team that worked on
Microsoft's Explorapedia, and he faithfully chronicles the
thoughts, emotions, struggles and doubts that guided the
development of the juvenile follow-up to the hugely successful
Encarta.

On his journey, Moody throws some fascinating insights into life
within Microsoft and the hopes, fears and doubts of the company's
employees and its founder and chief executive, Bill Gates.

It is to Microsoft's credit that Moody was given open access to
the team and the surrounding management, including Gates. But the
result is no PR exercise.

True to the portraits in other books of software builders, the
mainly young Explorapedia team work extremely hard - sleeping
under their desks, living off pizza, eschewing normal social
contact.

But the real insight begins with Moody's discovery that with 20
years experience writing about Microsoft - he works for Seattle
Weekly - and some 15 years covering the software industry, he is
a Gulliver among the Lilliputians. The people he mixes with may
know how to design and build software, but they don't know how to
manage people or a project. They have no idea how to hold a
meeting that achieves anything, they know little about life,
their interpersonal skills are non-existent, their observations
are frequently selfish and childish and they live in awe of that
great God, Bill.

Moody's take on all of this confirms some of Douglas Coupland's
fictional observations in Microserfs.

In his 1995 novel, Coupland raked over the soul of Microsoft and
found a bleak, cold heart. While Coupland has been more defensive
in recent interviews - pointing out that the average Microsoft
employee has a much better than average chance of becoming a
millionaire - the picture he created was of a corporation that
would be an unpalatable workplace for anyone with a personal
life.

While Microserfs is not as satisfying as the real thing portrayed
in I Sing the Body Electronic - in this case truth is stranger,
or at least more interesting, than fiction - Coupland has the
better cover title (Moody, inexplicably, derives his title from
the 1971 album 'I Sing the Body Electric' by the jazz group
Weather Report). These Microsoft programmers are truly serfs.
They may become very rich serfs, but they are serfs nonetheless,
serving an all powerful Lord as feudal in his people management
and distribution of largesse as any from the Middle Ages.

The prospect of serfdom still attracts 150,000 resumes a year from
keen young students and graduates. Given Microsoft's reputation
and commercial success this is understandable, but the appalling
treatment meted out to those 'lucky' enough to be granted an
interview gives pause for thought.

When the unsympathetic chief programmer on Explorapedia, Kevin
Gammill, takes relish in intimidating and humiliating would-be
programmers, the book hits a genuinely sombre note.

Given the pool of enthusiastic applicants, it is surprising to
learn that much of the development work is, in fact, carried out
by on-site contractors, who do not see anything of the Microsoft
share options, health benefits, free soda or even the possibility
of a plastic 'Ship It' award. The contractors usually join
Microsoft in the hope of getting offered a full-time job at the
end, despite the existence of an edict that bars them from being
recruited as permanent staff. As Gates puts it: "Where's the
added value?"

While Moody provides a fascinating insight into life on the
Microsoft campus, he also exposes some of the deepest worries of
the top management. Gates knows that the multimedia market is
going to be very large and that Microsoft should be heavily
involved. The problem for Gates is that while his company has the
expertise to build the delivery vehicle for multimedia, it does
not (yet) have the catalogue of material, the 'content', required
to ensure that Microsoft will be a major player. The book shows
Gates as paranoid about Microsoft's lack of 'content'.

The original material for Explorapedia came from Dorling-
Kindersley, the London-based publisher, famous for its
sumptuously illustrated children's books and travel guides. Gates
is portrayed as worrying that, through their involvement with
Microsoft, Dorling-Kindersley will learn how to produce
multimedia products and then deliver their own titles based on an
extensive back catalogue. He was right to worry, because Dorling-
Kindersley have since done exactly that.

The book gives the impression that Gates is kept awake at night
by the thought that the megamedia content owners, such as Time-
Warner, Sony, Disney and News Corporation, will make a fortune at
his company's expense. After all, while many companies can learn
how to develop multimedia software platforms, the copyrighted
material that actually sells multimedia products is may not
necessarily be available to Gates at any price.

          EMULATION WINDOW IS STILL AJAR FOR INSIGNIA

Initial public offering succeeds, but how long before the
company's core business fizzles out?

As suppliers, investors and analysts scour the globe for hot new
technologies and companies, the niche business of software
'emulation' tools is unlikely to attract much attention. Yet
emulation is the business of Insignia Solutions, the British
company headquartered in Mountain View, California. In spite of
pessimism about its niche, and a fall in technology stocks, last
month Insignia successfully placed its first public offering of
shares on Nasdaq. The issue raised $42 million in the form of
American Depository Receipts, about $16 million of which is
available to the company.

Insignia, now ten years old, is well known in the Unix and PC
markets, partly because its emulation tools have at times assumed
great significance in the battle between the key operating system
environments. Insignia's main product, SoftWindows, enables users
to run Microsoft Windows applications on Unix and Apple Macintosh
computers. This appeals to users that mix Macs or Unix machines
with swathes of PCs, but want them all to run particular Windows-
based 'personal productivity' software such as Microsoft Office.

Perhaps more importantly, the availability of SoftWindows has
enabled suppliers such as Apple to boast that their computers
will run Windows applications. Until recently, this was so
crucial to Apple that it bundled SoftWindows with its
PowerMacintosh computers. Unix workstation vendors such as IBM
and Digital Equipment also resell SoftWindows.

But Apple's decision in March 1995 to cease bundling SoftWindows
may indicate how tight a niche the Windows emulation market is
becoming. Apple's decision was partly strategic - it did not want
to endorse Windows - and partly because it saw little demand.
Products such as Microsoft Office come in nearly identical
versions for both platforms.

More worrying for Insignia, as the PC and Windows standard
becomes increasingly dominant and as the market for hardware-
based PC emulators for the Macintosh matures, the role of
software emulators may be further marginalised. If Microsoft's NT
operating system - which includes 16-bit Windows emulation -
continues to break ground in the server and workstation market,
there may be even less demand. Analysts say the emulation market
will grow only slightly over the next few years.

                        BEYOND EMULATION

Insignia executives are aware of the difficulties they could face
- although they say the end of the emulation market is many years
away. Brian Fawkes, Insignia's vice president of marketing,
hinted at acquisitions and new development projects, admitting
that one reason for the public offering was to raise money to
'look at other technologies and compliment what we are doing
today'.

But this does not mean the emulation business will be run as a
'cash cow'. Operating system emulation will be a "function that
we will always be following," says Fawkes. SoftWindows, he adds,
will be developed as a "very different product in three years,
able to support whatever products are out there". This could
involve adding value to the Intel processor instruction set
emulation which is likely to be built into RISC processors.

The emulation niche is not necessarily as small or as static as
some think. David Sidwell, Insignia's vice president of European
sales and support, agrees that Insignia is operating in a niche,
but insists it is a good one. He says the expected homogenising
of the desktop has not happened. The continued strength of the
Macintosh has meant solid but unspectacular revenues from
Insignia's Mac product, which makes up 60% of its sales and is
considered to have no competition.

Fawkes points to several new products to show its growing
diversity. One is NTrigue, developed with Network Computing
Devices, which will give users access to Windows NT-based
programs from their Unix X-terminals and low-end Macs and PCs
from early next year. A new version of SoftWindows for Unix that
provides full 486 emulation is due any moment.

The Unix market still has potential. Unix workstations are
selling in huge numbers, and SoftWindows, developed with the
approval of Microsoft, supports more applications than rival tool
Wabi from SunSoft. "Corporate buyers are looking at our Unix
product and many are looking at standardising on NT in the
future, which will make our NTrigue product very successful,"
Fawkes says.

Insignia's recent revenue history has been impressive, but not as
dramatic as some other young software companies. Revenues of $7.8
million in 1991 grew to $39.4 million in 1994 with profits of
$4.8 million. In the first nine months of 1995, Insignia
generated revenues of $41 million with profits of $4.6 million.
Setting aside a loss of $6 million in 1993, the year it worked on
its PowerMac version of SoftWindows, its performance has been
consistent, a sign that the well-connected company is also well
managed.

But how long before the emulation market slows or fizzles out?
Deborah Hess, senior analyst at Datapro in the US, says the
market will see steady but undramatic growth for a few years.
"This market has a definite two to three years. Beyond that it is
uncertain."

To secure a long-term future, Insignia must put the money raised
by the IPO to good use. Armed with $20 million and strong sales,
it is likely to make at least one acquisition - perhaps several -
and to intensify investment in research and development. Its
product and corporate announcements over the next two years will
provide more of an indicator.

            COMPANY SNAPSHOT: INSIGNIA SOLUTIONS PLC

Founded: Incorporated in the UK in 1985.
Ownership/financing: Owned by six venture capital firms plus
individuals and directors. Their shareholdings stand at about 48
per cent following the recent public offering.
Headquarters: Mountain View, California (since 1993).
Revenues: $41 million for the first nine months of 1995; $39.4
million in 1994.
Main products: Windows emulation software for Apple Macintosh
desktops and Unix workstations.
Competitors: PC emulator cards for the Apple Mac (from several
suppliers); SunSoft's Wabi for Unix.

            PC PROCESSOR MARKET FALLS INTO DISORDER

Pentium Pro's limitations offer reprieve for rivals. Competing
manufacturers struggle to innovate.

Until recently, the Intel compatible processor market was
reasonably well ordered. Custom- ers could tell which processor
was which and knew that upgrading to a newer microprocessor meant
more power. And as Intel sought to manage its growth, its volumes
and margins, it was also possible to chart roughly how much power
would be delivered by a new processor, and when.

 But all this looks set to change. As the competing vendors
struggle to innovate, and as the iapx86 design begins to near its
limits, the steady flow of Intel processors - from 286 up to the
Pentium '586', looks set to give way to a confusing mishmash of
competing products. By Intel's own admission, its new Pentium Pro
(or 'P6') processor does not run most PC software at all well.

Tests show that there is no significant performance gain from
running Windows or DOS applications on a 150 MHz (megahertz) P6
compared with a 133 MHz Pentium processor. Intel is now advising
PC makers to stick with the Pentium - a move that could later
impact its market share and profitability.

Meanwhile Intel's most formidable rival, Advanced Micro Devices
(AMD), is to take over rival NexGen, and is reviewing its product
line to accommodate NexGen's technology with its own. It will
drop its future K6 development in favour of NexGen's
architecture.

AMD, like Cyrix, another major competitor, is also changing the
numbering of its microprocessors in what many see as an attempt
to dress up older technology as new.

AMD is renaming its high-end 486 microprocessor the X5, in a bid
to grab some cachet from being associated as a fifth generation
part (ie, equivalent to the Pentium). Cyrix is playing the same
game, calling its delayed M1 microprocessor, originally a fifth
generation product, the 686 to make it seem like a sixth
generation product.

                            UNWELCOME

If the Intel-compatible processor market is to become less
ordered, it is not at the bidding of Intel or its rivals.

The first year of Pentium sales went according to the usual plan.
Intel then withdrew from the 486 market and took most customers
with it to the Pentium processor. US market research firm
Computer Intelligence Infocorp (CII) says that 486
microprocessors had about 55% of the market early in 1995 - this
is now just 25%.

It is not only user demand for more power that has led to the
rapid upgrade. "Intel's pricing strategy has made it financially
unwise for vendors to continue manufacturing and marketing 486-
based products," says Stella Kelly, analyst at CII. The threat of
the rival IBM/Motorola PowerPC RISC processor - a threat which
has since proved to be less immediate than Intel feared -
encouraged Intel to make the switch to the Pentium faster than it
had planned.

Initially, the strategy did no harm to the Intel-compatible
vendors but Intel, helped by the push to the Pentium, has
gradually got stronger. With prices now low, Cyrix has concluded
it cannot manufacture its 486 parts cost effectively and has
pulled out of the market. It is now concentrating on getting its
686 microprocessor out on time, to avoid a revenue blip.

 Analysts think highly of the 686 design - although its
competitive positioning would have been a lot worse if the
Pentium Pro was more powerful. "Cyrix's timing is a lot better
with the M1[686] and it should have few software compatibility
issues," said Mike Griffith industry analyst with US market
research firm In-Stat.

AMD's K5 Pentium competitor has suffered repeated delays due to
technical problems and will not now be delivered until the second
half of 1996. It is partly for this reason that AMD is taking
over NexGen. NexGen has been selling its Nx586 for a year but
sales have been hampered by the fact that it does not have a
Pentium 'pin compatible' part.

AMD is still confident of selling five million K5 units in its
first year and says it is talking with several major PC
manufacturers looking for an alternative to Intel. But it still
faces big problems: Linley Gwennap of The Micro- processor Report
points out that Intel's continuing price cuts on the Pentium mean
that AMD will be forced to sell the K5 for about $100, about the
same price as its high-end 486 part. Yet AMD will have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars getting the K5 part out and
ramping up production. "It will have trouble keeping its head
above water," says Gwennap.

                           WINDOW OPEN

If Intel had been able to deliver a powerful upgrade to the
Pentium next year, it would probably have crippled AMD. But while
Intel has managed to dominate the fifth generation market so far,
it will now be forced to leave the market window open wider than
it would have liked.

The reason can be traced back to its big software partner,
Microsoft. Four years ago, when Intel began designing the Pentium
Pro, Microsoft promised that its main desktop operating system
would be largely a 32-bit system - as are Windows NT and Unix. In
fact, the dominant operating systems are Windows 3.1 and
Windows'95 - both 16 bit systems. The Pentium Pro is only
significantly faster running 32- bit applications.

Intel points to faster versions of the Pentium Pro, running in
excess of 200 MHz, that will be out next year. It also says that
there will be increasing amounts of 32-bit software in future
versions of Windows 95. But, sources say, Intel realises there is
a problem and is working on a new version of the Pentium Pro
optimised for 16- bit software that will be out in early 1997.

"The Pentium Pro's poor performance in running Windows software
will give some extra breathing room for companies like AMD and
Cyrix," says Nathan Brook-wood, semiconductor analyst at US
market research firm Dataquest. To plug the gaps, in mid-1996
Intel will introduce the P55C, which is optimised for multimedia
processing. But the introduction of the 55C, which may offer
higher performance than the new architecture Pentium Pro, will
further confuse customers

If Intel's competitors want to benefit from any hiccup in its
business strategy then they will have to move fast. In 1997,
Intel will break with the iapx86 architecture and introduce the
VLIW (very long instruction word) P7, developed with Hewlett-
Packard. Even if the AMD, Cyrix and others are able to build
similar processors, competing against both Hewlett-Packard and
Intel - and the PowerPC consortium - is not going to be easy.

             SNI BENEFITS FROM CULTURAL REVOLUTION

German systems vendor back in profit

Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI) chief executive Gerhard
Schulmeyer spent 14 years of his business career in the US, first
as a senior executive at Motorola and latterly as head of the
engineering company Asea Brown Boveri. Those influences have been
all to obvious in his 18 months at the top of Europe's largest
indigenous systems vendor. His preferred working language is
English and he repeatedly looks to the entrepreneurial culture of
Silicon Valley for inspiration.

Last month, he was able to deliver evidence that his formula is
working. For the first time since it was formed in 1990 through
the combination of Germany's two biggest computer makers, Siemens
Data and Information systems division and Nixdorf Computer, there
was no red ink on the headline financial statement. Although much
aided by a revived German economy, SNI has managed an astonishing
turnaround. Losses that totalled DM350 million ($248 million) in
1994, swung to a slim profit of DM23 million ($16 million) for
the latest financial year ending 30 Sept-ember. Equally
impressive, revenues, which had been flat or shrinking for all of
its five years, jumped 10% in fiscal 1995 to DM12.8 billion ($9.0
billion).

How Schulmeyer has achieved the transformation is a lesson in
business re-engineering practice. But it also raises the question
of how SNI can sustain its elevation from its financial sickbed.

Over the 18 months, Schulmeyer has split SNI into 10 lines of
autonomous business, each of which "has to hold its own in its
own field". He has sent scores of managers to the US on
'entrepreneur' courses and tried to instill a culture of
innovation and openness, quickly dismantling SNI's historically
civil service-like clubbiness. "You no longer have to have your
ear to the wall to find out what is going on," says Schulmeyer.
"We have become a learning organisation." One manifestation of
this is the series of 'Friday Forums', where all of SNI's 37,200
employees get together to pick over issues ranging from working
practices to company strategy.

Schulmeyer says the reorganisation is now "more or less
complete". It has included a massive board level re-organisation.
Only three of SNI's top board of nine insiders and nine outside
directors have been with the company for more than three years.

Schulmeyer is now bullish about SNI's prospects. "There is now no
question of whether we have a chance of survival," he says. He
claims that SNI has moved into leading positions in many of
Europe's hottest computer markets. From nowhere, it has become
Europe's number four PC vendor - it is even turning a profit in
that market of wafer thin margins, despite the high cost burden
of building all of its PCs in Germany. In Unix mid-range systems,
it holds the number three spot. It also dominates the region's
market for high-speed bulk printers and is the second largest
vendor of point-of-sale equipment. In Germany, Europe' largest
market, it controls the number one position in all of these
products.

However, as the small overall profit indicates, not all business
units have made it as successfully into the black. Four, at
present, are still making losses, says Schulmeyer. Two can be
moved into profit this fiscal year, he says, and the other two
will be out of the tunnel in 1996/97. "Our agenda assumes that by
1996/97, all business units will be in the black." While he
declines to identify the loss-makers, he does point out that
SNI's mainframe division continues to show declining revenues.
The picture is the same in related computer maintenance.

In those areas and elsewhere, SNI has been making staff
reductions, though at a slightly slower pace than in previous
years. During fiscal 1995, headcount fell 5% to 37,200. Another
1,000 redundancies are expected this year.

Meanwhile, SNI's strongest engines of growth have been in Unix
servers and in point-of-sale systems. But perhaps the greatest
success story has been at its PC division, where revenues grew by
over 40% last year to DM2.8 billion ($2.0 billion) and units
soared from 390,000 to 636,000. Since October 1992, all decision
making for the PC business has been devolved to the unit managers
at the SNI PC factory in Ausburg near Munich. They have
drastically reduced the variety of models while investing heavily
in automation that allows PC to be snapped, rather than screwed,
together. To pare costs further, SNI took a 10% stake in Europe's
second largest PC retailer Escom, earlier this year. Buying
components together, the companies can benefit from volume
discounts and preferential supply. But most importantly, the
autonomy of the unit allowed the PC division to become highly-
responsive to market swings, allowing it to switch to new
specifications within weeks rather than many months. Back in
1992, when the factory was producing 190,000 PCs a year, it
calculated the break even point would be 500,000 units. Ausburg
is now running at 80% capacity and plans to produce 800,000 PCs
this year. But Schulmeyer believes that, to be a lasting success,
it has to get closer to 2 million units. That has encouraged the
thinking that SNI may be looking for less expensive manufacturing
sites outside of Germany, where 60% of its PCs are sold.

The location of the bulk of its PC customers points to SNI's
Achilles heel - the company's dependency on its home market.
Despite concerted efforts, Schulmeyer has been unable to raise
the proportion of business that SNI derives from outside markets.
For the past five years, 65% of revenues have come from Germany,
and he admits that the company is still searching for a formula
that will make it more successful elsewhere.

"Our market share often drops by a factor of 10 when we cross the
German border," says Schulmeyer. "International growth is our top
priority."

The goal is for revenues to be split one third from Germany, a
third from the rest of Europe and a third from the rest of the
world. But Schulmeyer admits "We don't have a solution to this
yet but somehow we will figure it out." He does not even express
optimism that SNI can attain its ideal of a three way split by
the end of the decade.

Nevertheless, that momentum in Germany has made the company the
world's 11th largest IT systems supplier, ahead of AT&T GIS, Bull
and Olivetti. In Europe, only IBM and Hewlett-Packard generate
more IT revenue.

In the US, the picture is very different. Revenues are barely
$500 million, although its acquisition of loss-making Unix server
maker Pyramid Technology in mid-1995 has come good. With Pyramid
no longer under threat of terminal decline, orders have picked
up, and it is now back in the black. Profits of over $10 million
were accompanied by revenues that grew by over 30% to around $300
million in 1995. That international expansion could be spurred by
further acquisitions - in the area of business services rather
than systems or software, says Schulmeyer, but Europe is the
priority.

SNI has not managed the turnaround without considerable help -
and a lot of patience - from Siemens AG, its $63 billion
engineering parent. Siemens has bankrolled the company through
its worst losses, and lent it capital to restructure. How much of
SNI's business flows from contracts placed by Siemens is not
public knowledge, but Siemens described as SNI's "preference
partner" by Schulmeyer.

In fact, SNI's revenues are due for a boost over the coming year
as Siemens begins transfering all of its computer centre
activities to SNI's outsourcing arm. Schulmeyer identifies these
activities as turning over DM 1 billion ($707 million).

That captive contract should help raise profits above 1995's
negligible amount. And Schulmeyer is under no illusion that he
has to get the company more solidly in the black. "We have got to
get away from the zero line, and show double digit growth to
avoid restructuring in the future."

However, if the German economy which has shown signs of decline
in recent quarters should falter, Schulmeyer will need every
ounce of his entrepreneurial flair to keep SNI bouncing back.

            HP CATCHING UP WITH IBM ON SYSTEM SALES

'Printer company' jibe rings hollow

Jealous rivals in the computer industry used to dismiss Hewlett-
Packard as 'a great printer company'. The description was meant
to imply that the computer, electronics, and peripherals giant
deliberately over-stated its importance in the computer industry
and played down the vital contribution of its printer business to
its phenomenal revenue and profits growth of recent years.

It is doubtful whether the jibe ever lost HP a single sale but,
even if it did, it is unlikely to be heard again after fiscal
1995. By any standards, HP has had a sensational year,
outstripping all its main rivals in just about every sector in
which it operates. Although HP does not break down its sources of
revenues, its total computer business, which it includes
workstations, servers, PCs and printers, grew nearly 30% to $7
billion during the quarter.

If HP can sustain this rate of growth for another 12 months, then
its executives can expect some banner headlines in November 1996.
Then, for one quarter at least, HP will be able to announce that
it has achieved what many must have thought impossible: in its
quarter ending in October 1996, it will have sold more hardware
than IBM did in its quarter ending September 1996. In fact, HP
nearly overtook IBM in the equivalent periods this year, with its
$7 billion worth of equipment nudging up against IBM's $7.75
billion.

True, these comparisons are a little unfair - IBM's much larger
fourth quarter ending in December is a fairer comparison with
HP's fourth quarter. Even so, they are an indication of just how
fast HP is growing. HP has a real chance of being the world's
number one computer maker early next century.

A few years ago, that crown once looked to be within the grasp of
Digital Equipment and, in order to put the heat on IBM, Digital's
salesmen wore badges bearing 2007, the year when they would
overtake IBM. HP is never likely to fall victim to such hubris.
With its fourth quarter revenue up a staggering 29% from $7
billion to $9 billion, and net income up from $476 million to
$678 million, its chief executive Lew Platt merely commented that
he "is encouraged by many aspects of its fourth quarter results".

Both financial and computer industry analysts were a little more
enthusiastic. "Phenomen- nally good", said a Merrill Lynch
analyst. HP is "extremely well positioned in almost every growth
market", said a Gruntal & Co analyst. HP reported big increases
in every one of its divisions, including its test and measurement
business.

Perhaps the most impressive performance by HP is in personal
computers, where it has come from almost nowhere to take a top
five position, with about 5.4% of the world market, in less in
than two years. Dataquest praised HP's performance in the PC
market, as did IDC, which described its growth as
"extraordinary". Analysts attribute HP's success to its strong
brand name, its manufacturing excellence, and its ability to
exploit its existing laser and inkjet printer distribution
channels. The downside of this success, however, is that its
overall gross margins have fallen by 3% because of the low-
margins of home PCs.

There is no immediate sign of a let up in HP's growth. Along with
its results, HP announced that its order book is healthier than
ever. It has $7 billion worth of orders for its computer systems,
it says, up nearly a third from a year ago. Against this
background, analysts dismissed speculation that HP will buy
Apple, circulating at the Comdex show in November, as fanciful.
Why. they ask, would HP, already growing so fast, want to take on
a company that is clearly troubled by major organisational and
strategic problems?

             TALIGENT NEEDS TO DEFINE FUTURE ROLE

Kaleida closure puts pressure on

When IBM and Apple formed their historic, three-part alliance in
1991, their goals could not have been more grand. First, they
wanted to create a new standard in microprocessors to challenge
Intel; next, they wanted to introduce a powerful new operating
system which would oust Microsoft from its position as the
leading supplier of desktop software. And third, they wanted to
lead in the supply of what was then viewed as the most exciting
technology of the day, multimedia tools.

Four years on, IBM and Apple still retain some slim hopes of
achieving some of their goals, but the grand vision lies in
tatters. Last month, IBM and Apple killed of their multi-media
software joint venture Kaleida, ending the company's long agony
(company insiders have been predicting its demise since early
this year). The move means a $75 million write off for each
company.

Down the road in Silicon Valley, some 400 employees at Taligent,
the object-oriented software tools company in which Hewlett-
Packard also owns a stake, are anxiously awaiting news. They have
been told it is business as usual, but persistent rumours suggest
that the company may be folded into IBM. This is because the
success of Microsoft in the past two years, along with other new
developments such as the World Wide Web, has almost killed demand
for a revolutionary new software environment.

"Employee morale is low. The ball is up in the air and no-one
knows where it will land," said one. Like many at Taligent, he
was recruited from Apple and says he does not want to work for
IBM.

As if this were not bad enough, the most successful part of the
alliance is also beset by difficulties. A top end 64-bit version
of the PowerPC reduced instruction set (RISC) microprocessor
family, jointly designed by IBM, Apple and Motorola, has been
indefinitely delayed (CBR November 1995). And IBM's failure to
deliver a viable PowerPC desktop system, along with Apple's
manufacturing and supply problems, have dimmed the long-term
prospects of the microprocessor.

Are the problems with each initiative related? In theory, each of
these projects is entirely separate, and involves other partners
and different ways of working. Yet Michael Braun, who headed
Kaleida Labs, can see at least one common factor: they are all
joint ventures. "Companies should have a counselling session with
me if they are thinking of doing one," he told reporters. "You're
stupid if you try."

Braun's complaint is that IBM and Apple could not stop bickering,
that they held a right of veto over Kaleida's decisions, and that
they prevented the company from developing software tools which
might compete with their own independent efforts. Although the
main authoring tool, ScriptX, is considered to be a technical
success, these problems meant it entered the market too late,
says Braun.

The two parents have now agreed that Apple will take over most of
the development work, although both will use some of the software
in future products. But does the failure of Kaleida bode ill for
Taligent? As one rival software supplier pointed out, "If the
model did not work at Kaleida, you have to wonder about
Taligent."

The comments of Joe Guglielmi, the former chief executive of
Taligent, are ominous. When he left in Septem- ber to head the
Motorola Computer Group, he said the company had completed its
first phase of software development and was on a "home run". Now,
he says, IBM and Apple are "re-evaluating everything".

The problems at Taligent are similar to those of Kaleida. Both
companies had grand ambitions and developed powerful technology
over a long period. But in each case, the fast-changing demands
of the market forced them to continually change their goals. In
the case of Kaleida, it missed development deadlines and its
ScriptX product was beaten to the market by Macromedia, which now
dominates (CBR November 1995).

Taligent has not missed any development deadlines, its defenders
note. But its original plan, to develop a completely new object-
oriented operating system, was abandoned because it became clear
there was no demand. Its lesser goal, of delivering powerful
object oriented tools and object "frameworks" for users and
software suppliers, has not fallen behind schedule, but it is a
much smaller market. Although the Commonpoint toolset is to be
delivered this quarter, making it unlikely that IBM and Apple
will pull the plug just yet, a scaling down of development effort
is likely.

That, in effect, puts the future of Taligent in the hands of the
market. If there is sufficient interest and take-up of the
development kits in the first half of 1996, then it is likely to
remain independent. But if there is insufficient demand, it will
be integrated back into IBM. As Guglielmi points out, "It fits
well into IBM's strategy." HP has so far remained silent, but has
never made the kind of commitment to Taligent that IBM and Apple
have.

Although almost every developer who has seen Taligent is highly
impressed, one commonly cited concern is that it was developed
before the Internet and the World Wide Web had caught on.
Companies such as NeXT Computer, which has a rival object
development tool, and Sun, which has the Java language, have re-
oriented their object oriented development environments in this
direction. In comparison, Commonpoint may be seen as a worthy,
but less immediately attractive development. If Taligent is to
make an impact, IBM and Apple will have to restate their
commitment and the company itself will have to demonstrate how it
is responding to market demands.

             CMG MAKES CAUTIOUS STOCK MARKET ENTRY

IT services group seeks 'fame' not cash

From its outset in 1964, CMG Plc, the Anglo/Dutch IT services
group, has always fostered a culture of employee ownership. With
share options built into every staff contract, around 1,850
employees, ex-employees and their relatives, along with their
pension and trust funds, own equity amounting to 90% of the
company whose headcount stands at 2,650.

But the fact that CMG has been privately held all these years has
meant that there was no way of cashing in that stock, apart from
trading on the internal spot market that grew up within the
company. All that changed in early December as CMG launched a
dual flotation on the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges,
establishing its market capitalisation at around $180 million.
That valuation is a modest one times the company's projected
annual revenues for 1995 of #200 million ($310 million), a figure
that betrays an underlying nervousness about the listing.

In fact, the company says its principal reason for the flotation
is in order to raise its profile in the eyes of its corporate
clients and within the pan-European services market. "We did it
for name and fame," says Cor Stutterheim, CMG chairman. CMG has
certainly has not gone public in order to raise large amounts of
capital. The share offering only netted CMG $6.1 million ($9.5
million).

For a company growing at 36% and which has been profitable for
each of its 31 years, that caution borders on the paranoid. Its
jumpiness has been picked up from the London stock market which
is justifiably bearish about high-tech issues. Over most of this
year, the market for IT stock has been poisoned after a number of
newly-floated companies missed their earnings forecasts by a
mile. That meant that CMG's initial run up to a listing, back in
the Spring of this year, had to be cancelled at a cost of half a
million pounds.

Companies like MDIS, a rival to CMG in certain markets, are still
trying to right their financial reputations. Judging from its
prospectus, CMG has grounds to be more bullish. Revenues grew by
14% in 1994 and CMG indicates that the strong performance that
result-ed in 36% revenue growth during the first half of 1995 has
continued in the second half of the year. This paves the way for
a #200 million year end.

Profitability is also solid - at least in Holland. After a first
half when its net profit was #5.3 million ($8.2 million), the
company is projecting a second half net of #12.1 million ($18.8
million) before flotation costs and #10.4 million ($16.2 million)
after. That is 44% up on last year's figure.

About 90% of the company's profits come from the Netherlands,
which has now become the UK-founded company's principle operating
region. Two third of revenues are derived from Holland, 26% come
from the UK and the other 10% from Germany, where CMG
strengthened its position in February with the DM18 million ($7.9
million) acquisition of system development/services provider
Pecom.

Operating profit margins at 15% are strong in Holland and weak in
the UK at 4%. The German operation is just moving out of the red.

In all three markets, CMG is still very much focused on software
development. Around 72% of revenues still come from projects and
applications software, while 21% is sourced from payroll
processing and facilities management contracts and the remaining
7% comes from management consultancy.

Despite its financial track record and the strong employee
loyalty that comes from collective ownership, CMG still has some
issues to resolve.

The death earlier this year of founder Douglas Gorman, coupled
with the fact that the company's principal financial centre has
shifted to Holland, raises some questions of whether the UK
should have such a strong role in the company as it expands
throughout Europe.

Secondly, despite the flotation, the company is not cash rich. In
fact, during the first quarter, when it paid out for Pecom, its
reserves dwindled to #5.1 million, forcing it to sell an 8%
tranche of equity to ABN Amro Bank. Even after the flotation, its
balance will only stand at #16 million, which is low given the
30% plus growth rate CMG is experiencing.

PERFORMANCE MONITOR

This month's results in the information technology sector
continue the trend that has been seen all year, with business
good across the board. Although certain companies may be
struggling, even companies in the less fashionable sectors are
faring well.

This month, one set of figures stands out - computer systems
builder Hewlett- Packard announced its fourth quarter and annual
revenues and, once again, enjoyed dramatic growth (see page 47).
It is now almost half the size of IBM and is close on the heels
of Fujitsu, the second largest largest supplier of IT equipment
and computers.

In personal computers, even the weaker competitors have been
reporting acceptable results this year, as the boom continues.
But there are exceptions. AST Research, a long-term survivor in
the PC market, has been having a difficult time for the past 18
months, and is beset by manufacturing problems and product
delays. In its latest quarter, AST announced losses of $96
million, compared with $39 million for the same quarter last
year. Revenues fell 19%, as price cuts, a shortage of new models
and the closure of some divisions took their toll. AST's weakness
enabled the Korean giant Samsung to take a 40% stake in the
company early this year, for $378 million. To protect its
investment, Samsung has now agreed a a $50 million line loan to
AST, backing up another $100 million line of credit that AST has
negotiated with BankAmerica. None of the cash is going into the
hands of the management that got the company into this trouble.
Three top executives resigned in September, including the
president, and a fourth, the chief financial officer, has now
decided to go.

Advanced Logic Research, a long-standing rival in the second tier
of PC makers, tends to concentrate at the higher end of the PC
market, but it too is suffering from increasing competition. For
its fourth quarter, revenues increased 12% to $53.4 million, with
net profits of just $2 million. ALR's financial performance is
improving - but its market share is falling and it is
underperforming compared to the market.

One PC maker that is most definitely back on track is Dell
Computer, which announced revenues up 60%, to $1,415 million, and
net profits up 80%, to $75.4 million for its third quarter. Dell,
which suffered two years of problems between 1992 and 1994, now
has a slick product line and is concentrating on its
traditionally successful direct sales channel. Dell said 82% of
its sales are from its higher value Intel Pentium-based machines.

One sector that most definitely is booming is Online Services and
Internet Tools. As the Internet began to take off, some analysts
predicted that suppliers of 'proprietary' online services, such
as America Online (AOL) would suffer; AOL's Steve Case, its chief
executive, always argued that AOL, the world's most popular
online service, would thrive as it would be used as a gateway to
the Internet. So far, he is right. AOL is thriving, with first
quarter revenues up 248% to $57 million for the first quarter.
However, it made a loss of $10 million because of a $17 million
charge related to the acquisition of Ubique Inc. AOL, which has
recently launched in Europe, signed up 700,000 subscribers in the
last quarter, compared with 525,000 who signed up for the
Microsoft Network, a service which many believed would fatally
damage AOL.

Another Internet related supplier is Spyglass Inc, the supplier
of the original Mosaic browser software. Given the enormous
popularity of Netscape, Spyglass is considered by many to be
underrated. But it is still a small company and, in spite of
alliances with the likes of Oracle, it may never gain the
critical mass needed to make a global impact. Fourth quarter
revenues rose 61% to $3.3 million, bringing the 1995 total to
$10.4. Fourth quarter net profits were $1.2 million.

Quarterdeck Software, once known for its PC utility software, is
in the process of re-engineering itself as a supplier of Internet
utility software. For its fourth quarter, revenues increased
142%, to $20.3 million, while losses fell from $15.4 million to
$0.6 million. Quarterdeck CEO, Gaston Bastiaens, described the
improvement as "a remarkable turnaround". So far, the company
derives 10% of revenues from Internet products, but this is
likely to rise fast.

One company which has analysts worried is General Magic, one of
the more glamourous IPOs of 1993. The company, which makes
operating systems and agent-oriented software, is considered to
be vulnerable to the success of Sun's Internet language, Java. In
the third quarter, sales fell 28% to $3.2 million and losses rose
to $5.1 million.

                       COMPUTER MARKETS

The US IT industry grew faster than the world IT market for the
third year running, according to market analyst IDC. Total US IT
industry revenues rose 10.3% to $183.8 billion in 1994, compared
with world IT growth of 7.5%.

US growth has been powered by the PC market, but analysts predict
a sharp slowdown in PC sales over the next five years. IDC
estimates that 22.6 million PCs will ship in 1995, a rise of
20.9% on last year, pushing revenues up 20.0% to $46.4 billion.
But in 1999 the market will be worth $67.9 billion, indicating
revenue growth of only 6.6%, with 36.5 million units shipping
that year, up only 10.3% on 1998.

The US software market will rise from $35.2 billion in 1994 to
$71.1 billion in 1999 - a growth rate in the "low-to-mid teens".
The US LAN hardware and software market will grow by 11% a year,
to $15.4 billion by 1998, from $9.1 billion in 1993. US spending
on outsourcing was up 9.4% in 1994 to $63 billion. The overall US
services market is expected to grow to $102 billion by 1998, says
IDC.

* The worldwide market for all types of electronics products -
computers, mobile phones, video consumer goods, appliances, and
so on - will grow by 11.7% this year to $791 billion, predicts
market analyst Dataquest. With a compound growth rate of 9%, the
market will rise to $1,196 billion in the year 2000, "providing a
strong foundation for semiconductor market growth over the next
five years".

                        INTERNET USAGE

The Internet will become a major vehicle for business
transactions in the next few years, as confidence in secure
communications grows, according to a recent survey by market
watcher IDC. The survey of 189 corporate Internet sites shows
that only 14% of installations use the Internet for product
transactions. IDC says that will rise to 34% next year and to 44%
over the next three to five years.

The survey of Internet usage shows that, most commonly, corporate
sites use the Internet for emailing suppliers and partners (62%),
job advertising or seeking (60%), document publishing (56%) and
competitor research (56%). In five years time, these will still
be high priority, but they will be joined by the use of the
Internet for customer service/technical support (73%).

The North American book-to-bill ratio, the primary gauge of the
health of the semiconductor industry, showed a steep rise to 1.18
in October, as PC and other electronics product vendors ramped up
orders in preparation for the Christmas selling season. The
October figure, up from an amended 1.15 in September, took the
index to its highest point since August, according to the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).

A ratio of 1.18 shows there were $118 of orders (bookings) in
October for every $100 of products shipped (billings). A book-to-
bill ratio of more than 1.0 indicates a positive market trend,
because orders are higher than sales. The figures are calculated
using a three-month moving average and are seasonally adjusted.

October bookings rose to $4.9 billion, up 4.4% on September, and
were up 55.7% on the same period last year. Billings increased to
an all time high of $4.15 billion, up 37% on October last year.
The SIA's forecast for 1995 is that the market will grow 40.2% to
$47.1 billion.

                      PERSONAL COMPUTERS

The PC market worldwide grew by 21% during the third quarter of
1995 to reach $11.7 billion with 14.2 million units shipped over
the period, according to market research group Dataquest.

The analyst group predicts that the fourth quarter will be the
hottest in the history of the personal computer industry as year-
long supercharged growth is capped by a Christmas buying frenzy.
About 17 million units should be sold in the three months to the
end of December, spurred by Europe's continued economic recovery
and strong growth in Japan and the US.

During the third quarter, Compaq continued its reign at the top
of the industry by shipping 1.5 million units, 265,000 or 21.6%
more machines than during the same period last year. This marks
its seventh consecutive quarter in the leadership position.

However, Compaq found Apple snapping at its heals. During the
three months, Apple's shipments were up 20.5% to 1.3 million
units, allowing the Macintosh PC supplier to regain the number 2
ranking from IBM. Aided by strong seasonal sales into the
educational sector, Apple ended the quarter with an improved
market share of 9.0%, up from 7.4% in the second quarter. With a
growth rate of 13.2%, IBM exhibited the slowest pace of the top
five vendors, although it still sells over a third more PCs than
its fast growing nearest challengers, Packard Bell and NEC, which
grew at 30.5% and 47.9% respectively.

* In Europe, Compaq, IBM, Apple, Vobis and Olivetti all suffered
market share erosion as relative newcomers to the market Escom,
Hewlett-Packard and Siemens-Nixdorf accelerated during the third
quarter.

Compaq's market share at 13.1% was down from 14.1% a year
earlier, and IBM saw a dip in its market share from 9.9% to 9.1%.
Germany's Escom pushed Apple into fourth place as its share of
the market grew from 3.9% to 5.4%. Over the year, Apple lost 1.3%
of the market, leaving it with a 5.2% share, while a newly-
aggressive Siemens-Nixdorf added 1.3% to reach 5.1% of the
Europe-wide market as it rose to take the number one position in
the German personal computer market.

Overall, European growth in the third quarter, at 24%, was again
much stronger than the 10% reported in the equivalent period last
year. However, the pace showed a slight slowing from the frenetic
29% and 28% growth recorded in the first and second quarters in
Europe.

                     OUTSOURCING IN EUROPE

The IT outsourcing market in Europe is expected to continue its
explosive growth over the next half decade, with demand highest
in the manufacturing, government and financial services sectors.

Market research analyst Input says that the outsourcing market in
the region will grow from $6.1 billion this year to $15.0 billion
in the year 2000.

The largest contributor and the fastest growing sector will be
the manufacturing industry. Here, outsourcing spend will more
than double from $2.2 billion to $4.6 billion. The government
sector will also be a source of huge growth, with revenues of
$1.4 billion in 1995 rising to $3.8 billion in the year 2000.
Those government sector numbers will be mirrored in the financial
services sector.

                            LETTERS

                   Second generation thoughts

Your article on Second Generation Tools in CBR November 1995 was
interesting and thought provoking. As you noted, the number of
players rushing to deliver client/server applications development
tools is growing at a rapid rate. As this market develops, I
believe the critical factors will be twofold: one, the
development tool's ability to deliver an enterprise-level
solution to companies with high-end mission critical
requirements; and two, the ability to deliver real business
benefits.

When organisations are selecting a client/server application
development tool, they should look for one that combines the ease
of use of a first generation tool with the power and robustness
of a second generation tool. This tool should enable developers
to build quickly and easily even the most complex enterprise-
level applications with sophisticated logic and data
requirements.

Experience is critical in this market, and it is a key reason why
I believe the market landscape is still to be determined. In
discussion with our customers, we have found that organisations
require certain key technologies in order to build enterprise-
level second generation applications, including object oriented,
team development and configuration management capabilities, as
well as a strong, widely known 4GL-based environment.

A second generation tool is clearly more sophisticated and should
offer developers not only the ability to quickly build enterprise
class client/server applications without the need to use a 3GL,
but also give the developers the choice of deployment platforms
without changing any code. The key differentiator that users
should look for is the flexibility to decide the deployment
platform at develop- ment or deployment.

The first generation and second generation application
development tools on the market today each meet specific user
needs. It is up to the user to determine their application
requirements and to choose a tool that best fits their
environment. The players in each generation are battling to be
the biggest and the best and, in most cases, claiming they can
offer an effective solution for both generations. At Progress
Software, we are delivering solutions now for enterprise-wide
second generation client/server development with all the
essential technologies.

                         Building blocks

I read your article on client/server application development
software, 'Second Generation Tools' (CBR November 1995), with
interest. While we see client/server as the driving force behind
computer technology in the future, 'second generation' is a
misleading term. I think the idea of 'componentware' is more
appropriate.

Componentware allows you to build applications by plugging
elements together. Thus, if I want to integrate 'Help' into an
application, I don't write the code, I just use what is already
available in Word or Excel. I don't commission 20 programmers to
write me a graphics engine over two years; Microsoft has already
done it. I just plug and go. Componentware is revolutionising the
way software is delivered.

What componentware means is very simple. Applications will be
delivered more quickly, more robustly, more flexibly and with
more functionality. It's simply about plugging discreet modules
together to create a system. If you get it right, you will be
able to plug in new technology as it arrives and unplug old
technology with minimum fuss.

For example, a recent experience [of ours] showed the power of
componentware. A customer wanted to plug into a database they
hadn't used before and it took less than one day. It also means
the user can drive the delivery of solutions far more than ever
before. [A supplier] cannot seriously consider asking users to
wait a year or two years for an all-important system. It's not
worth worrying about; they probably won't be around if you have
to wait two years anyway. Componentware is the smart way to build
systems for people who need systems to give them business
advantage.

                          Hard lessons?

I thought your article on Xerox (CBR November 1995) was a
thorough analysis of where the company has come from and where it
stands today. The portrait you paint is of a organisation that is
clearly highly successful but which has been complacent about
exploiting many of its technological innovations. What worries me
is that it is possibly about to repeat that mistake again.

Xerox's newly-launched all-digital photocopier, the Document
Centre, may make conventional photocopiers look crude, but where
is the real value for customers in knowing that the copying
process has involved digitising the resulting document. Unless
Xerox is also selling a complete digital office software
infrastructure that can exploit the digitisation of documents,
then there will be little perceived value in simply turning the
document into bits.

The document image processing industry knows this scenario only
too well. Its initial offerings could scan, OCR and store huge
quantities of documents. But it was only when the digitising
process of these document was encompassed in a workflow software
infrastructure that customers began to perceive that document
imaging was an enabling technology that could make their
businesses more efficient. Xerox needs to do a lot more than make
the copier a computer.

                          BOTTOM LINE

                    CLARIFICATIONS & UPDATES

In the article "Second Generation Tools" (CBR November 1995) Gene
Bedell, chief executive of Seer Technologies, was quoted several
times. Unfortunately, we misspelt his name as Bidell.

                       NETWORK THE DOGGED

Sun Microsystem's new corporate mascot, Network the Dog, a
greater Swiss mountain dog, has caused the company some cultural
difficulties. The idea of representing Sun's sometimes
complicated sales message in the form of a friendly dog was
dreamed up by an outside agency. Scott McNealey, Sun's chief
executive, overcame his misgivings and followed their advice.

But although Network the Dog's appeal to North Americans and
Europeans is obvious, he has not gone down well in China, where
dogs are considered dirty and low. And in the UK, the term "dog"
is often used to mean a "dud" or a poor performer (for example,
"This network runs like a dog").

There are further difficulties: Network the Dog has a crowded
schedule, appearing at exhibitions and the like. But some
countries have strict quarantine regulations, making
intercontinental visits difficult. To overcome this, Sun has been
using lookalike dogs. This means that if you are offered a photo-
opportunity with Network (a big part of Sun's campaign) outside
the western side of the US, the chances are that you will be
photographed with a Network emulator.

                           AGED JOKES

The old East Coast high-tech industries, typified by companies
such as IBM and Digital Equipment, are starting to become the
butt of some self-deprecating humour. First, there was Digital's
move out of its old headquarters, the Boston Mill. The building
was sold to an old people's home, it was said, so that they did
not have to move too many people out. Meanwhile, at Xerox's high
tech offices in Stamford, Connecticut, the environmentally
conscious company has installed lights that turn themselves off
when there is no movement. In the offices of certain senior
managers, it is said, the rooms frequently darken during the
afternoon.

                            HOMELESS

Digital Equipment has downsized so fast in some countries that
staff formed "DEC ex-employee" groups, partly to provide mutual
support and partly to reminisce about the days when Digital
expected to overtake IBM as the world's largest and most
profitable computer company. In France, Digital's ex-employee
group has a reported 1,700 members. Of these, two are now
officially homeless.

                         VIOLENT PIRATES

Software piracy is viewed as a harmless and relatively victimless
offence, in spite of the efforts of the Software Publishers
Association and the Business Software Alliance to portray it as a
practice that is crippling the industry. In fact, some analysts
even think that some suppliers approve of a certain level of
piracy because it draws in new users. But all this, it seems, may
be about to change.

According to recent reports, criminal gangs are moving into
software copying - perhaps encouraged by their success in
stealing and re-selling processor and memory chips. When police
recently raided the Los Angeles address of alleged pirate Thomas
Alefantes, they found $1 million of copied software, computers,
high speed disk copiers, label printers, shredders, a pair of
handcuffs (?) and two guns. Earlier this year police raided
another gang's premises, where they found 40,000 software
programs ready to ship, along with explosives and guns.
Discoveries of this kind are said to be delighting the SPA, which
is now able to publicise software piracy as a real crime.

                         SUPER-SURVIVORS

Shortly after our article on supercomputers (CBR, November 1995),
which outlined the recent success of IBM's RS/6000 SP
supercomputer and the problems being suffered by smaller
suppliers, market analysts IDC published a report outlining
European sales of the leading vendors. IDC echoes the view that
some of the smaller vendors will not survive, and pinpointed the
British owned company Meiko as particularly vulnerable.

Meiko's 1995 European sales, IDC notes, were about the same as
nCube's, the company owned by Oracle founder Larry Ellison's, at
just $8 million. NCube, as reported in CBR (August 1995), is also
thought to be suffering from a slowdown in sales. RS/6000 SP
sales are expected to be $75 million.

There was good news for one minor vendor last month: Thinking
Machines, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
earlier this year, has put together a rescue plan which involves
reselling software and designing systems based on the UltraSparc.
Sun Microsystems will recommend the systems to its customers, but
will not directly resell them. The plan brings into question
Sun's relationship with another troubled vendor, Cray Research,
whose system it currently resells.

                         EDUCATION BOOST

British educational software company SIR intends to float on the
new AIM (Alternative Investment Market) in the UK early in 1996,
say insiders at the company, rather than list on Nasdaq in the
US.

Although SIR is 30% held by the San Jose-based venture capital
company Berg & Berg, the UK market is favoured partly for
political reasons - both the Conservative and Labour parties want
to be seen to boost education in the run-up to a 1996/7 election,
and both are expected to announce grants or tax breaks for more
IT spending in schools. Both parties have been looking for co-
operative agreements like the recently announced BT/Labour party
plan. Under this agreement, BT has agreed to put public
organisations "onto the information superhighway" if it is
allowed to offer services. SIR, which is barely into profit, says
this is boosting the value of educational IT suppliers. Research
Machines, a leading supplier of computers to British schools, has
a remarkably healthy share price, in spite of poor results.
