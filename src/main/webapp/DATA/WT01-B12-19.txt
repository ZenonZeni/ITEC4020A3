 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 PLUS
 </H2>

<P>  Co-Enzyme Q-10 is a nutrient necessary to the functioning of every cell in our bodies. Our bodies could not survive without it.  If body levels start dropping, so does our general health.
   Scientists estimate that once levels drop below the 25% deficient levels, many disease states begin to flourish including high blood pressure, heart attack, angina, immune depression, periodontal disease, lack of energy, weight gain and even early death.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 AND ENERGY</H2>
<P>  Co-Enzyme Q-10 is known as CO-Q-10 and also ubiquinone.   It is a member of the quinone cyclic compounds that may be considered a relative of some potent anti-cancer drugs.  CO-Q-10 can add or remove oxygen from biologically active molecules.</P>
<P>  Every cell of the body contains many subcellular components called mitochondria, which produce 95% of the total energy of the body. CO-Q-10 is an integral part of the membranes of the mitochondria where it is involved in the production of ATP the basic energy producing molecule of cells.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND AGING</H2>
<P>  When immunity is low, so are the reserves of  CO-Q-10. When body levels of CO-Q-10 are raised, so is the immune potential. AIDS victims and other people with depressed immune systems can receive some help from antibiotic and anti-viral drugs, but they will not rebuild the immune system. Mice have been shown to have a 50% extended life span by supplementing with CO-Q-10.</P>
<P>   Co-Enzyme Q-10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells against free radical damage and exerting a protective effect on cell membranes. CO-Q-10 can naturally stimulate the immune system and result in a wide range of beneficial and protective effects.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE HEART AND BLOOD PRESSURE</H2>
<P>   Tissues that require the most energy (such as the heart) need the largest amounts of CO-Q-10.  Angina is a condition where inadequate oxygen is available to the heart muscle itself.  People with failing cardiac systems have shown to greatly benefit with increased strength and vigor when supplemented with CO-Q-10.  People with high blood pressure usually have lower levels of  CO-Q-10.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CO-Q-10 AND WEIGHT LOSS</H2>
<P>  It has been shown at the University of Texas and the University of Antwerp, Belgium that obese people can lose weight simply with the addition of CO-Q-10 to the diet. This research showed that obese people can have as much as a 50% deficiency of Co-Enzyme Q-10 in their tissues.</P>

<P>  People who eat a lot and yet stay slim have significantly higher levels of CO-Q-10 in their blood.  This wonderful enzyme can increase metabolic fuel efficiency within your cells - stimulating natural weight loss.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PERIODONTAL HEALTH</H2>
<P>  Co-Enzyme  Q-10  exerts  its  protective  and strengthening action in all tissues.  Working from the cellular level, it strengthens the gums as well as the heart muscle.  Many scientists believe that periodontal (gum) disease is a good indicator of low levels of CO-Q-10 in other tissues. The American Dental Association states that at least 87% of the American population has some sort of gum disease. This has been shown to be somewhat related to nutrition and particularly to levels of CO-Q-10, which has been shown to have a good protective effect for gum tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE CO-Q-10 FAMILY</H2>
<P>   There are at least ten common CO-Q's, that is, different sized molecules from CO-Q-1 to CO-Q-10. The liver can utilize other CO-Q's to make CO-Q-10.  If the liver is not functioning efficiently, body levels can be too low, especially with advancing age or if disease is present. Our internal ability to produce CO-Q-10 declines with age, and as we get older, we must rely more on our diet.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IS CO-Q-10 SAFE?</H2>
<P>   In tests of thousands of people, no toxicity has ever been shown, no matter how high the amount. Plants and animals get it from the soil, but we get it from the plants and animals that contain various CO-Q's.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CO-Q-10 PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CO-Q-10 PLUS</H2>
<P>  There is no definite amount determined, but remember that more is needed as more energy is required. This is especially so if extra nutritional support is needed for the immune system, the heart, to lose weight or to protect against degenerative disease.  Life Plus CO-Q-10 PLUS tablets are packaged in bottles of 60. One to three tablets are recommended one to three times daily.</P>
