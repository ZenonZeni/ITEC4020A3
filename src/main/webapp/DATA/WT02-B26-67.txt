<H2>MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE TREATABLE . . .</H2>
<hr>

Mental Illnesses Are Treatable Neurobiological Disorders
<P>
Our nation's investment in mental illness research has been
paying outstanding dividends.  New medications and psychosocial
treatments resulting from this investment will more than pay for
their development costs by offsetting the tremendous burden now
borne by society.
<P>
For example, the 1969 introduction of lithium to treat
manic-depressive illness resulted in average yearly savings in
treatment costs of $290 million in the United States.
<P>
In this, the "Decade of the Brain", research supported by the
federal National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -- now part of
the world-renowned National Institutes of Health (NIH) -- has
spawned revolutionary breakthroughs in treatment so that millions
of Americans can be helped to lead more productive, less painful
lives.
<P>
The 1990 introduction of clozapine to the U.S. market has
permitted thousands of previously treatment-resistant persons
with schizophrenia to regain social and economic productivity.
<P>
While the causes of mental illnesses remain unknown, data from
several major studies illuminate the role of biological factors
in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.  
<P>
The Cost Of Not Providing Care
<P>
Untreated or under-treated mental illness results in enormous
costs to society, including lost work, reduced productivity, and
prison recidivism.
<P>
The number of persons with mental illness among the homeless is
estimated to be between 200,000 and 350,000 persons.  There is a
shocking high rate of suicide among persons with severe mental
illnesses on our nation's streets, and in its shelters and jails.
<P>
The recent federal Interagency Task Force Report on Homelessness
and Severe Mental Illness " Outcasts on Main Street " vividly
depicts the personal and societal consequences of this failed
commitment to a vulnerable class of citizens.
<P>
In September, NAMI and Public Citizen Health Research Group
released a national study Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally
Ill: The Abuse of Jails as Mental Hospitals revealing that over
37,000  mentally ill individuals are now in jails, most charged
with simple misdemeanors such as loitering or trespassing.
<P>
Nearly one third of these persons have not been charged with any
crime; they have been arrested on "mercy bookings" because access
to mental health care is restricted or denied.  
<P>
A pervasive public stigma against persons with mental illnesses
manifests itself in countless ways, only one of which is in
insurance coverage.
<P>
Third-party payers typically cover the costs of treatment for
non-psychiatric or physical illnesses in full, or with minimum
patient contribution, while excluding or limiting coverage of the
treatment of mental (or psychiatric) illnesses. 
<P>
Schizophrenia and severe depressive illness are essentially
viewed by private industry and government as second-class
illnesses in this country.
<P>
Often private coverage is limited to $1000 a year for outpatient
care and 30 days of annual hospitalization with a $25,000
lifetime maximum, while similar limitations do not exist for the
treatment of cancer, diabetes or heart disease.
<P>
These misguided restrictions often force families to deplete
their lifetime savings, liquidate their homes and personal
belongings, and ultimately rely upon an under-funded and
overburdened public system.  
<P>
For persons fortunate to be enrolled in a minimally-acceptable
employer-provided insurance program, the irony is that
professional mobility is restricted because of industry-wide
"pre-existing condition" clauses.
<P>
Persons with severe mental illnesses are particularly impacted by
these restrictions, as mental illness often strikes during the
late teen years and early adulthood.
<P>
Many young persons find themselves in limbo -- too old to
continue coverage under their parents' policy and too young to be
in the workforce where insurance is generally purchased.  And
most persons diagnosed as mentally ill are unable to qualify for
any form of health insurance.
<P>
Insurance For Mental Illness Is Feasible
<P>
The debate over national health care reveals a concern that
insurance cannot support endless psychotherapy for "problems of
living" that affect the so-called "worried well". 
<P>
NAMI agrees that such non-medical interventions are not vital to
the needs of persons who suffer severe mental illnesses.
<P>
We do assert that advances in diagnosis and treatment for
specific, biologically-based, severe psychiatric disorders make
them relatively inexpensive additions to private coverage.
<P>
The cost of caring for persons with mental illnesses in the
community in the PACT Program of Dane County, Wisconsin has
reduced costs by two-thirds.
<P>
This model program, now 20 years old, is widely acknowledged to
offer state of the art treatment and support for persons with
severe mental illness.
<P>
In the 102nd Congress, a bipartisan group of twenty-one U.S.
Senators, led by Senator Pete V. Domenici and including then
Senator Albert Gore, Jr., co-sponsored legislation (S. 2696)
which would establish a comprehensive federal policy with respect
to provision of the health care coverage and services to persons
with severe mental illnesses.  
<P>
Several state legislatures have either enacted or considered
proposed legislation covering the more severe mental illnesses,
once presented with the relevant data outlining the incidence of
these illnesses and the modest medical treatment costs associated
with their management. 
<P>
Actuarial data on the costs/benefits associated with coverage of
the most severe mental illnesses have been instrumental in
convincing policy-makers across the country that these illnesses
can be included in insurance coverage at only a small additional
premium cost when set against a large pool of insured persons.
<P>
For example, the added cost of covering the biologically-based
mental illnesses on the same basis as other physical illnesses
for residents of the State of Maryland is estimated at
approximately $1.00 per covered person per month.
<P>
A Coopers and Lybrand study of residents of the State of
California yielded a $0.78 increase in premium cost. The federal
NIMH is currently evaluating national cost data for utilization
in the 103rd Congress.
<P>
In order to keep total costs within tolerable limits the Domenici
sponsors and certain state legislatures have recognized the need
to draw some  distinctions between the severe and persistent
illnesses and emotional distress associated with life events.
<P>
The costs of treatment of severe brain disorders are not
excessive as studies have proven, if the patient has available,
and adheres to, an integrated regime of treatment with
pharmacological agents, medical monitoring, and some supportive
services.  
<P>
Cost Containment Strategy
<P>
President Clinton has repeatedly stated his belief that
government must first serve those in our society who are most
vulnerable.
<P>
NAMI supports this position and believes that the direct and
indirect costs associated with the lack of adequate health care
coverage for people with severe mental illnesses far exceed the
costs associated with providing treatment services.
<P>
NAMI believes that mandating health insurance coverage for the
severe mental illnesses could slow the explosive growth of
Medicaid, SSI and SSDI since persons with mental illnesses are
the largest single group among those now covered.
<P>
Over time, more equitable coverage of persons with severe mental
illnesses will also stem the tide of persons with mental
illnesses in crisis now pouring into jails, emergency rooms, and
shelters.
<P>
People with severe mental illnesses are a growing burden on
public hospitals which face rapid escalation in the cost of
uncompensated care.
<P>
By shifting those specific costs to the private sector and
treating severe mental illnesses like any other major illness
such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, an entire group of
vulnerable disabled people can avoid descent into poverty which
typically occurs when psychiatric benefits are exhausted but the
illness continues.
<P>
Managed Care And Managed Competition
<P>
Given the dismal failure of our present fee-for-service third
party reimbursement system, NAMI members view with cautious
optimism the new emphasis on organized systems of health care
delivery.
<P>
The emphasis within these delivery systems on the total care
management for the individual seeking treatment services could
well mitigate the problems associated with the fragmented funding
and delivery system which currently exists for persons with
severe mental illnesses and allow for a continuum of
medically-necessary and appropriate services.
<P>
In addition, the large health insurance purchasing groups should
certainly have the economic clout to negotiate more comprehensive
coverage of benefits than is presently available for small
employers and individuals, thereby assuring greater consumer
access to coverage. 
<P>
The fact that pre-existing condition exclusion clauses would be
repealed also removes a widespread barrier to insurance coverage
for persons with disabilities.
<P>
The managed competition model's reliance on treatment outcomes
and practice guidelines should promote greater accountability to
insurers and consumers alike that limited health care dollars are
utilized wisely and effectively. 
<P>
NAMI strongly calls for a role for consumers and family members
in the governance of these new health insuring structures as well
as in ongoing monitoring to assure high quality clinical services
in both hospital and outpatient settings.
<P>
At the same time, NAMI members join with our colleagues
throughout the disability community in wishing to reserve
judgement until a new delivery system is operational and fully
evaluated by consumers and their family members.
<P>
Our primary concern at this time is whether specialty care
services -- such as those provided by a psychiatrist to an
individual with a severe mental illness -- can be integrated into
the core benefit package likely to be required in any accountable
health plan.
<P>
The range of treatment needs for persons disabled by illness is
presently provided through the state Medicaid program through
several optional benefits.
<P>
Should Medicaid be repealed the discussion must immediately
center on how best to ensure access to rehabilitation,
pharmaceuticals, case management and other support services
within the framework of the managed care model.
<P>
The acute care insurance model with its emphasis on physician and
hospital services is critical to this population, but not nearly
sufficient.
<P>
The services provided through the public sector of government
(Medicaid and the state hospital system ) must continue to
be provided, either through direct inclusion in the basic
benefits package or perhaps through contracts or other
affiliations with existing public providers.
<P>
For the longer term services needed for full consumer functioning
in society, such as housing supports and vocational
rehabilitation services, NAMI insists that government continue to
support them categorically and with sufficient funding.
<P>
Continuous and timely access to specialized treatment and
rehabilitative services must be assured if in fact these services
are mandated within the managed care model.
<P>
With the emphasis on pre-paid capitated financing, an incentive
is inherently created to prudently manage the fixed health care
budget, perhaps to the point of discouraging access to
psychiatric specialty services. 
<P>
NAMI feels that for those individuals in need of more than
primary care services consideration be given to assigning a
psychiatrist as the primary care gatekeeper who would then be
responsible for managing that individual's treatment planning. 
<P>
All too often, our members report, general medical professionals
are poorly trained in the management of psychiatric illness and
lacking the continuing education to stay abreast of modern
effective treatment interventions.  
<P>
While severe mental illnesses cannot be prevented with the
current state of medical science, specific, recurring episodes of
psychosis, mania, depression and other aspects of the illnesses
can be prevented by early identification and early initiation of
good treatment regimens. 
<P>
Innovative programs such as those in Madison, Wisconsin and
Waterloo, Iowa feature a central authority, like the managed care
"gatekeeper" which is responsible for all aspects of treatment
and services provision.
<P>
In these example areas, the cost of treatment was reduced by more
than two-thirds in the years following implementation. Important
to the success of these integrated services models is the
continuous treatment, team concept which integrates and links
medical and social support services.
<P>
Summary
<P>
Given the broad agreement that coverage of severe mental illness
reduces societal costs in terms of homelessness, reliance on the
criminal justice system, and other social and welfare programs,
the following summarize NAMI policy objectives in health care
reform efforts:
<P>
-- Distinction between severe, disabling brain disorders and
emotional distress associated with problems of living in order to
keep program costs within reasonable limits. 
<P>
-- Attention and resources must be devoted to the needs of
persons with chronic and disabling illnesses in any acute care
model.
<P>
-- Integration of medical, rehabilitative and social support
services in the delivery system.
<P>
-- Attention to the needs of special populations, e.g. veterans,
children and ethnic minorities.
<P>
-- Attention to maintaining and equalizing guaranteed access to
long-term rehabilitation services when and if Medicaid support is
phased out.
<P>
-- Emphasis on treatment guidelines and treatment outcomes to
create accountability.
<P>
-- Consumer and family involvement in evaluation of program
effectiveness.
