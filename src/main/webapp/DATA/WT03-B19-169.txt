<P>
In 1994, 38,603 local students completed degrees in Victorian
universities, of which 11,053 were postgraduate degrees.  Some
of the major areas of study and the numbers of students who completed

Such is the international reputation of Victoria's education system
that in 1993 there were also some 19,000 fee-paying students from
overseas undertaking courses in Victoria, some 30% of the national
total.  Around 90% of these students are from Asia, particularly
Hong Kong, Malaysia, the People's Republic of China, and Singapore.
<P>
The technical and further education system caters for the occupational
training requirements of trades, para-professional and operative
staff.  There are an estimated 400,000 people enrolled in technical
and further education courses in Victoria.  The providers of these
services are particularly responsive to the needs of industry
through flexible training programs and other initiatives to meet
the changing needs of firms for a trained workforce.
