<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>

Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker would
be Rep. Richard Gephardt.  After flirting with many "New Democrat" political
themes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decade
to espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,
and other forms of government intervention in the economy.<p>
<p>
As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in the
congressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victory
in this November's congressional races would probably have three immediate
effects on the economy.<p>
<p>
It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar.<p>
<p>
It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico as
well as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable to
congressional demands for more restrictive trade polices.<p>
<p>
It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about new
investment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election would
affect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor market
regulation.  Ironically, <i>such caution might cause bond yields to fall during
early 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 the
weakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economic
slowdown.</i><p>
<u></u><p>
As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, it
is doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets might
fear this autumn.  But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised by
the upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries during
early 1996.  With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such a
rapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary.<p>
<p>
Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politics
of the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income.  He
suggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusing
on the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which had
helped to produce the Buchanan primary victories.  If the Democrats regain
control of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in their
legislative agenda for 1997.<p>
<p>
The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints.  First, real wages
have been stagnant for several years.  Secondly, there is growing income
inequality on the basis of differentials in education.  Thirdly, corporations
provide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same time
that they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle income
workers.  <p>
<p>
There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to the
growth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's.  <i>But it is
far from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are a
good proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation.</i>  There is
considerable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation.  If we adjust
wages with the GDP deflator or the non-farm business deflator, there has
actually been moderate growth in real wages during recent years (see charts
21-25).  Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in
order to avoid taxes, including pensions and health care.  Such benefits are
now equal to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late
1940's.<p>
<p>
There is growing income inequality based on education because new developments
in technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workers
compared to people with fewer skills.  With the economy now close to full
employment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity to
improve their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.
The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost one
half of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment has
always encouraged faster wage growth in the past.<p>
<p>
Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for their
executives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices have
risen sharply.  The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13% of
U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong to
ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership).  As a result, there is a weak link in
the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership.  About 51
million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,
defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but they
do not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives in
most corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has been
magnified  in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500
companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980.  During
the past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced their
employment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact that
total U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million.  The high visibility
of the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense of
insecurity among American workers than can be justified by the economy's
overall employment performance.<p>
<p>
While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock option
programs and insensitive public relations in the way it conducts
restructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labor
market for job creation in the industrial world.<p>
<p>
<i>Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor
force of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor force
entrants.</i>  About 20 million American also change their job every years.
Since 1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a
labor force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor
force entrants.  As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt
digit levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people.<p>
<p>
The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility compared to the other countries.
Among those in the bottom income quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to
the top income quintile, 30% to the second and 21% have moved to the third.
The number of American households earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994
dollars has risen from 1.0 million in 1967 and 2.7 million in 1980 to over 6
million today.<p>
