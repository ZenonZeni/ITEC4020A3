Abstract: The Ontario Home Builders' Association has commissioned
a research and demonstration project to investigate critical aspects
of basement wall performance. Specifically, this project addresses
the problems of water leaks and examines the feasibility of installing
full-height insulation at the time of construction.

Abstract: Historic buildings often consist of uninsulated masonry
walls. Such structures have lasted well because the absence of
insulation and relatively low humidity levels of interior air
have kept the stone cladding warm and dry. The growing need for
controlled conditions inside the existing building have led to
an increase in typical levels of humidification, which presents
serious threats to the integrity and performance of traditional
wall construction. The dynamic buffer zone (DBZ) has been designed
to introduce an intentionally controlled space between the controlled
interior environment and the variable exterior environment. This
limits the migration of moisture-laden air from the interior into
the exterior masonry wall, thereby greatly increasing the potential
service life of such assemblies. Further benefits of the DBZ can
be derived by integrating the DBZ with the building's HVAC systems.
This paper describes the building physics issues, the DBZ system,
and outlines its application to a 60 year old building in Toronto.

Abstract: Heating ventilating and air conditioning duct insulation
in a building located in south Florida was removed because of
heavy fungal infestation of the building. Samples of these materials
were examined by direct microscopy and enrichment culture. Additional
insulation samples were desiccated for three weeks over silica
drying gel, weighed, then placed over saturated salt in water
solutions at known relative humidities. At relative humidities
approaching 95% some insulation samples on an average gained 6%
of their dry weight in water. The water gain at various relative
humidities ranged from a low of 2% to a high of 9.3% of the dry
weight. The hygroscopic nature of duct insulation and its capacity
to absorb or trap organic particulates or volatiles is most likely
a contributing factor in fungal colonization. The urea and formaldehyde
levels in some insulations may control which fungi colonize these
substrates. This paper also reviews efforts to made the face coating
of insulation more resistant to fungal colonization.

Abstract: Describes a case study which involves a nursery school
in which fungal infestation led to serious health complaints from
staff members. Despite only partial implementation of the investigators'
recommendations, the situation was improved. The structure in
question is a nursery school that occupies a large brick one-story
building in eastern Canada. The school is a nonprofit organisation,
and several parents had contributed to the design and construction
of the facility. Because of inadequate funds, part of the basement
remained unfinished. The building housed about 80 children and
staff members. The 6,000 square foot, one-year old building had
a concrete basement floor under one-half of the structure. The
other half of the basement was covered with sand, which became
humid due to lack of good drainage. The main retaining wall was
covered with gyproc going from the ceiling to the sandy floor.
There was no mechanical ventilation in the building, except for
washroom air exhausts. The building had openable windows, except
in the unfinished basement area, which had air vents and an outside
door.

Abstract: This article deals with the different factors which
influence the thermal comfort of operating staff. It seems not
possible to all members of the operating staff to realize thermal
comfort. The different activity levels and the different clothing
play an important role. Thereby we suppose that the surgeon will
be dressed in hygienic clothing and he will receive heat radiation
from the operating lamp, so he will wish the lowest temperature.
For the anesthetist who is often dressed lighter and has a lower
activity can cold complaints arise.

Abstract: Past thermal comfort research has shown differences
in the thermal sensation votes given in field and laboratory settings.
However, such research tends to compare the votes of different
groups of people in different environments rather than comparing
the same people in each environment. Therefore, a two-phase study
was conducted of the thermal comfort of 30 BRE employees in their
home, in their office, and in a climate chamber. In the first
phase each subject spent two 3h sessions in each environment and
the temperature was adjusted between sessions within the range
18-26oC. Data loggers were used to record the air and mean radiant
temperature, air velocity and relative humidity; subjective ratings
of thermal sensation were obtained using questionnaires. The subjects
wore the same clothing in each session and were allowed to conduct
only sedentary activities. The reported thermal sensation votes
were compared with those predicted using ISO 7730. The observed
neutral temperatures for each of the three environments differed
by up to 2oC and were up to 1oC different to those predicted.
This finding has implications for energy use. In the second phase,
the subjects were studied in their home and office only. No restrictions
were imposed on clothing, previous or current activities, or environmental
conditions. The observed thermal sensation votes were very poorly
correlated with those predicted and with operative temperature.

Abstract: A Canadian consulting company and university jointly
developed an HVAC system that can be controlled by office occupants
to suit their individual desires. The system consists of ceiling-mounted
nozzle-type air diffusers which can be swivelled in any direction
and whose air flow can be controlled by a motorized damper. The
damper is controlled by a hand-held remote controller.

Abstract: Tracer gas concentration is measured using a gas analyser.
These can be extremely complex and costly systems which add considerably
to the expense of performing a tracer gas test. Various types
of systems exist and it is vital that the correct detector is
chosen for the gas and gas concentration used.

Abstract: Acceptable thermal environmental conditions for healthy
people may be determined using thermal sensation votes and physiological
data, but, for laboratory animals, alternative methods are necessary.
Previous reports have shown that exposed body surfaces play an
important role in thermoregulation. The noninvasive procedure
of thermography does not disturb the natural behavior of the animals
but allows for the estimation of comfortable temperatures by measuring
changes in skin temperature. Using this procedure, it was observed
that tail skin temperatures of rats, mice, and house musk shrews
caged singly differed from individual animals of the same species
housed in groups. Also, a temperature gradient between the animal
cage and the climatic chamber was detected; the gradient was smaller
for singly caged animals than for groups. The data suggest that
comfortable temperatures for rats range from 26 to 27.5oC; 25
to 27oC for mice; and 23 to 25oC for house musk shrews.

Abstract: Detailed air turbulence characteristics in a full-scale
and running fan-filter unit type clean room (4.20m x 2.97m x 2.70m)
with and without a clean bench loaded are investigated experimentally.
The measurements of the three components of air velocity were
conducted by means of a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer.
Velocity vectors, turbulence intensity, turbulence kinetic energy
and probability density functions of velocity direction and velocity
contours in the space domain are presented. The results show that
the non-uniformity and deflection angle of air velocity are within
13% and 7.9 degrees, respectively. Moreover, the mean flow patterns,
turbulence characteristics, and histogram features of the air
flow are discussed. The detailed experimental data are not only
useful for clean room design and equipment layout but also helpful
for use in the evaluation of numerical modeling in clean room
flow fields.
