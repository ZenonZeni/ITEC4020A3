<p>
The Kobe earthquake crisis offers Japan a unique opportunity to begin
implementing a vision of 21st Century economic and environmental
re-development.  A team of American experts from a variety of disciplines
ranging from construction and economic redevelopment to environmental planning
are offering their expertise to help with the rebuilding of the Kobe region in
the aftermath of the recent tragedy.  This American team would work together
with local counterparts to develop a vision and series of concrete steps for
the sustainable re-development of Kobe.  The process of providing this
sustainable design assistance could be greatly facilitated by support from our
two countries' governments.<p>
<p>
The core American team would be comprised of members of the American Institute
of Architects (AIA), the Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology
(CREST), Daybreak International, Global Environmental Options (GEO), the
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and the Union of International
Architects (UIA).  These organizations have consulted with staff in the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE) and
Department of State (DOS) on this proposal.  The American team is seeking to
develop a public/private partnership with both the Japanese and U.S.
governments, as well as with private sector parties in both countries.  Members
of the team have begun to make contact with their counterparts in Japan.  <p>
<p>
The organizations represented by the American team have carried out
"Environmental Design Charrettes" (EDC) of one form or another to kick-off
sustainable design programs.  Simply stated, an Environmental Design Charrette
is a cooperative and integrated approach to design and planning problem
solving, which recognizes long-term economic and social development, and
environmental responsibility as key components to the realization of a
sustainable vision.  EDCs succeed in bringing diverse elements of a community
together in collaboration to develop a comprehensive view of the
interconnection between economic need, community development and long-term
environmental sustainability.<p>
<p>
Over a several-day period, design professionals and community participants
could conduct an EDC to target opportunities to rebuild Kobe, taking into
account the community's vision for Kobe in the 21st century.  Kobe could become
the model environmental city advocated by Madame Wakako Hironaka, former
Environment Minister of Japan.  A multi-discipline group of
experts--experienced in the EDC process--will assist the local participants.
In addition, teleconference, Internet, and satellite links can be established
to create on-going communication between the project and outside resources.  By
the end of the Charrette, a successful EDC will have used a multi-faceted group
of community participants to identify and address the key sustainability issues
for their chosen design problem.  <p>
<p>
The EDC process has been successfully undertaken in several places in the
United States, sometimes in response to natural disasters (Mississippi Floodway
Communities), sometimes in response to economic problems (Chattanooga), or an
environmental problem (Grand Canyon).  Here are some specific examples of EDC's
that have successfully merged environmental sustainability considerations and
economic viability with building and community design:<p>
<ul>
<li><u><b>The Greening of the White House:</u></b>  A comprehensive, multi-year project
designed to improve energy efficiency and cut waste through the complex.
Nearly 100 national experts from the fields of architecture, engineering
building management and environmental concerns were brought together to engage
in this process.<p>
<li><u><b>Valmeyer, Illinois &amp; Pattonsburg, Missouri:</u></b>  The EDC process
assisted their efforts toward disaster mitigation in rebuilding these
communities after the Mississippi River's Great Flood of 1993.  The project
involved technical design assistance to help the civic leaders and residents to
create more environmentally sound community plans.<p>
<li><u><b>The Sustainable Grand Canyon Workshop</u></b>:  At the Grand Canyon--which is
threatened by overuse--the EDC team is working to create an on-going regional
partnership to address and implement integrated environmental solutions in the
areas of: economic development, energy efficiency, land use, wastewater,
buildings, and human factors.<p>
</ul>
<p>
The focus and emphasis of each charrette depends on the design problem, but the
following sustainability elements should be included:<p>
<ul>
<li>Energy building envelope and windows; lighting and daylighting; plug loads;
heating; cooling and ventilating systems.<p>
<li>Building ecology; materials; indoor air quality.<p>
<li>Air, water and landscaping:  site design; aquifer recharge; surfaces.<p>
<li>Physical infrastructure:  water, utilities, parks, transportation, etc.<p>
<li>Waste management: pollution prevention; construction and demolition waste;
building operations waste; water and waste nutrient recovery.<p>
<li>Economic development: creation of "green"industries; reducing pollution from
existing business.<p>
<li>Human Factors: cultural issues;, environmental equity; social and community
involvement; city scale and liveability.<p>
</ul>
<p>
The number of participants varies according to the needs of each EDC and is
determined in conjunction with the host community.  Most Charrettes to date
have consisted of 30 to 60 people usually working in small groups.  An EDC
planning team will work to integrate approaches developed by the groups to
achieve a comprehensive set of recommendations.  Three elements are essential
to a comprehensive solution:  economic opportunity, social equity and
environmental responsibility.<p>
<p>
However, the EDC workshop is only a small step toward creating awareness of
opportunities and the need for long-standing commitment to environmental and
economic development of our communities.  Experience has shown that a number of
elements are essential for effective and sustained community development that
builds upon design assistance initiatives:<p>
1. Multi-disciplinary linkages: link university-based and community-based
professions.<p>
2. Impact area methodology: create focus by combining project and programs
within "high-impact" areas selected for demonstrable and replicable results.<p>
3. Community participation and initiative: emphasize working with communities
in collaborating and participatory partnerships that maximize local initiative,
volunteerism and community based leadership.<p>
4. Integrative coordination: link local initiatives (bottom up) to broad
networks of programs and policies (top down).<p>
5. Participatory design process: emphasize the skills of group brainstorming,
design and decision making, best illustrated by the "charrette" process.<p>
6. Sustainable community development: emphasize the need to combine economic,
social and environmentally sustainable practices.<p>
7. Research and documentation: summarize the work including evaluation of EDC
process so that others can learn from the process.<p>
<p>
The power of the EDC is that the community is given the key role in helping
create their vision of the future.  The role that the American team of experts
would provide is one of facilitation and sharing of experience and knowledge.
The process of developing this project results from lessons learned during the
process of these Environmental Design Charrettes:<p>
<ul>
<li>The first lesson involves the need to get involved early, before too many
decisions are made.  Often some of the best opportunities to incorporate
sustainable design are lost because the urgent need to return life back to
normal forces decisions to have been made before the EDC process could take
place.<p>
<li>Another lesson is: do not cause delay in the redevelopment process.
Fortunately, experience has shown that the EDC process can take place as
quickly as conventional redevelopment planning, while leading to spectacularly
improved results.  <p>
<li>The third lesson is that technologies and designs which reduce energy
consumption and improve environmental quality often cost the same as or less
than conventional approaches, but result in significantly reduced costs and
waste produced.  <p>
<li>The final lesson is that by being a leader in implementing forward-looking
approaches to re-development results in economic opportunities which were not
present before.  For example, it is possible that Kobe could become the
manufacturing and distribution center for Japanese energy efficient and other
"green" products.  Their initial market base, of course would be their own
rebuilding efforts, but as environmental opportunities continue their explosive
growth around the world, there should be a ready market for both the production
as well as the implementation expertise developed through this project.<p>
</ul>
<p>
It should be stressed that Environmental Design Charrettes are only the
beginning of a <u><b>process</u></b>.  This process is begun with the EDC and can be
sustained through follow-up visits, teleconferencing, Internet links, and the
use of digitally-based live/video communications technology, depending upon the
interests of the host community.  Based on our past experience, a project of
this nature is likely to have three basic phases:  <p>
(1) <b>Project Development</b>:  This phase would involve establishing a
constituency in Japan for the services being offered, and assembling bilateral
teams of specialists in the U.S. and Japan.  During this phase the potential
for incorporating sustainable development principles and technologies into the
normal rebuilding process will be assessed.  The scope and content of the
Environmental Design Charrette would be agreed upon by both sides and
foundational organization would be undertaken.  Because of the urgency of
returning Kobe to normal, this phase would need to be accelerated.<p>
<p>
(2) <b>Conduct Environmental Design Charrettes</b>:  The actual workshops would
take place and the working contacts between Japanese and American experts would
be formalized.  The American expert team would be there in support of Japanese
specialists.   Plans for future in-situ and electronic follow-ups would be
developed as appropriate.<p>
(3) <b>On-going Exchange and Support</b>:  Since this process will be a
learning experience for both sides, opportunities to apply lessons learned in
Kobe to situations in the U.S. should be explored.  The "nitty-gritty" work
that follows the long-range planning most likely would be conducted by site
visits and through various electronic link-ups.<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
Hope and opportunity often spring from tragedy.  We hope that both sides will
embrace this opportunity to build an enduring relationship between our two
countries in order to create a more sustainable vision for our shared future.
Our organizations stand ready to work with our Japanese neighbors to quickly
develop an environmental design process to help Kobe rebuild sustainably.<p>
