Sertindole</FONT></FONT></I></B></DT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">On July 15, 1996, the Psycholpharmacologc Drugs
Advisory Committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted
to recommend that Serlect ( Abbott’s Brand Name for sertindole) be approved
for the treatment of psychotic disorders. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Among the data reviewed by the committee were
the results of a seven-arm, multi-center, double-blind, eight week clinical
trial comparing three doses of Serlect (12, 20 and 24 mg/day) to three
doses of haloperidol (4, 8 and 16 mg/day) and placebo. In the study, all
Serlect doses and haloperidol doses showed significant improvement in the
positive symptoms of schizophrenia compared with placebo and in reducing
the total scores on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS). Only
Serlect at a dose of 20 mg/day improved negative symptoms, as measured
by PANSS Negative Symptom Subscale. On a comprehensive, global scale of
improvement, all doses of Serlect and haloperidol were associated with
significant improvement compared to placebo. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The positive symptoms of schizophrenia include
delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behavior. Negative
symptoms include apathy, social withdrawal, and decrease in productivity
of thought and speech. Patients using haloperidol experienced motor side
effects called extrapyramidal symptoms, or EPS, at rates significantly
higher than those given placebo. EPS profiles for Serlect at all doses
were clinically and statistically indistinguishable from placebo. In addition,
patients treated with any of the three doses of Serlect exhibited less
EPS than patients using any of the three doses of haloperidol. Researchers
measured EPS rates by the number of EPS-related adverse events, use of
anti-EPS medication, and three standard movement rating scales. This EPS-profile
is important because EPS can be extremely disabling, can cause severe discomfort,
and may reduce treatment compliance. This is also important because studies
show that, among patients receiving currently available short-term treatment,
as many as 70 percent may have some clinically important EPS side effects.
While recommending approval, the committee discussed the need to make patients
aware of a condition that potentially increases the risk of abnormal heart
rhythms. In clinical studies, approximately 4 percent of patients showed
an increase in QT intervals -- alterations in the heart’s usual rhythm.
QT interval prolongation is sometimes a precursor for serious alterations
of heart rhythm. In clinical trials, adverse events with an incidence of
5 percent or more in patients treated with sertindole and at least twice
that of placebo were: nasal congestion, dry mouth, abnormal ejaculation,
and vaginitis. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">In clinical trials, Serlect was administered
once daily in a capsule formulation. It is a novel, limbic-selective antipsychotic
drug. As with other antipsychotics, the exact mechanism of action of Serlect
is not known. However, in pre-clinical studies, Serlect was demonstrated
to be a potent antagonist at dopamine D2 , serotonin 5HT2 and alpha1 receptors
without activity at histimatic H1 or muscarinic receptors. This selectivity
suggests that Serlect mitigates both the positive and negative symptoms
of schizophrenia, but should not produce sedative effects or anticholinergic
effects related to these other receptors. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+2>Clozapine May Curb Nicotine Craving</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">A study published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry shows that clozapine leads to a reduction in smoking among patients
with schizophrenia. The prevalence of smoking in this group of patients
runs as high as 90 percent. Several factors may account for these higher
rates of smoking, including alleviation of depressive, psychotic and anxiety
symptoms through the effects of nicotine on relevant neurotransmitter systems.
Smoking also may relieve some of the side effects of psychotropic medications.
Tony George, M.D., a coinvestigator at the Yale University Connecticut
Mental Health Center in New Haven, reports studying 29 outpatients enrolled
in the clozapine clinic of a community mental health center. The most significant
decrease was associated with the heavier smokers. There also are anecdotal
reports linking clozapine to reduced alcohol and opiate craving. </FONT></B></P>

<H2><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Treatment Preference Act</FONT></I></B></H2>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Signed into law by Governor Edgar on December
15, 1995, The Treatment Preference Act will enable those receiving mental
health services to plan for the types of services they may need in the
event their judgement becomes impaired due to their illness. In the Declaration
for Mental Health Treatment, you assign an “attorney-in-fact” to act on
your behalf, who follows your pre-ordained, written instructions. These
instructions determine whether you are to receive psychotropic medications,
the types of medications you are willing to receive, whether or not you
desire electroconvulsive therapy, and whether you are willing to be admitted
on a short-term basis (no longer than 17 days) to a treatment facility.
The instructions which you include in the Declaration will only be valid
if 2 phsycians, or a court, find you incapable of making treatment decisions.
Otherwise, you will be considered capable to give or withhold informed
consent. You may also revoke the Declaration, either in part or in its
entirety, at any time you are considered capable by a physician to give
or withhold informed consent. Otherwise, the Declaration remains in effect
for three (3) years. Below, and continued on page 11, is a sample Declaration
for Mental Health Treatment. Once signed and witnessed, (it does not need
to be notarized) it becomes effective upon being delivered to your attending
physician. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Lilly’s Zyprexa (olanzapine)
Cleared for Marketing for Treatment of Psychotic Disorders </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The United States Food and Drug Administration
has granted Eli Lilly and Company permission to market Zyprexa (olanzapine)
for the treatment of the symptoms of psychotic disorders. This is the second
major regulatory clearance for Zyprexa. Zyprexa was cleared for marketing
in 15 European countries by the European Medicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA)
on September 27, 1996. Zyprexa has demonstrated a promising therapeutic
profile, including once daily dosing, low risk of drug interactions, no
requirement for blood monitoring and a therapeutic starting dose without
a requirement for titration in most patients. In clinical trials, patients
were assessed using several test instruments, including the Brief Psychiatric
Rating Scale (BPRS), an 18-item inventory of symptoms traditionally used
to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in psychosis. The BPRS score
was extracted from the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS), a
30-item rating instrument that evaluates each symptom item on a scale of
1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The BPRS psychosis cluster assessed psychotic
symptoms, such as conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness
and unusual thought content. A second assessment, the Clinical Global Impression
(CGI) measures the overall severity of the illness. In addition, patients
were evaluated on the PANSS and the Scale for Assessing Negative symptoms.
In a sic-week, placebo-controlled trial involving 149 patients, patients
received either placebo or a fixed dose of Zyprexa at 1 and 10 mg/day.
In this trial, Zyprexa at 10 mg/day (but not 1 mg/day) was superior to
placebo on the PANSS total score, the BPRS total, the BPRS psychosis cluster,
the PANSS negative symptom subscale and on CGI severity. In a six-week,
placebo controlled trial involving 253 patients, patients received placebo
or one of three fixed dose ranges of Zyprexa (5 &plusmn; 2.5 mg/day and
15 &plusmn; 2.5 mg/day). the two highest Zyprexa dose was statistically
superior to placebo on the SANS. The overall rate of early discontinuation
due to an adverse event was comparable to placebo. Lilly’s clinical trials
also included a 1,996-patient trial in which patients were given either
Zyprexa or the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic. In addition, Lilly
is currently conducting trials comparing Zyprexa with other new antipsychotics
on the market. Many currently available older antipsychotic medications,
although effective, have been linked to extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) events,
including abnormal muscle spasms, Parkinson’s-disease like symptoms, abnormal
jerking or writhing, and an inability to sit still. Clinical studies have
associated Zyprexa with a low incidence of EPS. In clinical trials, treatment-emergent
EPS assessed by formal rating scales occurred at incidences comparable
to placebo. As assessed by these scales, the incidence of EPS did not increase
as the dose of Zyprexa was increased. Given the concern about agranulocytosis,
a sometimes fatal blood disorder associated with other psychotropic compounds,
careful attention was given to the examination of hematologic parameters
in clinical trials. There is no indication of a risk of clinically significant
agranulocytosis associated with olanzapine treatment. Consequently, Zyprexa
patients will not have to submit to weekly blood monitoring tests. As with
all antipsychotics, Zyprexa was associated with some side effects. In acute-phase,
placebo-controlled trials, the most frequently observed treatment-emergent
events associated with olanzapine at an incidence statistically greater
than placebo were somnolence, dizziness and weight gain. The incidence
of elevated hepatic trasaminase levels was greater with Zyprexa; these
elevations were generally transient and asymptomatic. About 1 percent of
patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment due to transaminase
increases. Other commonly observed adverse events associated with the use
of Zyprexa were constipation, personality disorder and postural hypotension;
these event rates were not statistically greater than placebo. In only
one analysis of a placebo-controlled study, only one specific form of EPS,
akathesia, was reported significantly more often with Zyprexa (at 10 &plusmn;
2.5 mg/day or 15 &plusmn; 2.5 mg/day) compared with placebo.</FONT></B>
