<p><font face="Arial"><tt>The Women's National Committee for Law
Enforcement</tt></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>During the 1920s, the Women's National
Committee for Law Enforcement, a federation of Protestant women's
organizations that claimed at least 12 million followers,
observed that prohibition was partially effective in achieving
its goals. The group sought better law enforcement for the better
realization of the reform, as its president, Mrs. Henry W.
Peabody, informed a Senate committee. </tt><i><tt>The National
Prohibition Law</tt></i><tt>, Hearings before the Committee on
the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, 69th Congress, 1st Session (1926):
666-67</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>We represent here to-day not only
organizations of women, but, as a whole, we represent the home,
the school, the church, and we stand firmly for no amendment to
the eighteenth amendment. We hold the Constitution of the United
States inviolate. We stand for no modification of the Volstead
Act, but rather a strengthening. We stand for strict law
enforcement, with the removal of all men who do not strictly
enforce the law.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>We believe that in the greater part of
the territory of this country the law is observed as well as any
law. Having traveled in various parts of this country we did not
observe more drinking than ever. We find conditions vastly
improved. Health, as testified to by the insurance companies;
morals, as shown by the statements which will be produced later;
and certainly the economic condition, on the word of our
Secretary of Commerce, seem to have justified prohibition.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>The conditions in States like New York
and Maryland, where there is no State enforcement law, which is
required by the eighteenth amendment, framed to secure concurrent
action, are bad. The only remedy, it seems to us, as women, is
not a change of law which is satisfactory to the majority of the
States, but to do what the Constitution requires to make the law
enforceable. That would remove very many of the offenses which
are piled up to prove that the Nation is not appearing to enforce
its laws.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>As women, we know the old saloon and
the wreckage in homes and lives of boys, men, and women. While
the vote for the eighteenth amendment was the vote of the men--it
was also the vote of the women who had prayed and worked for
protection from this ancient evil. We had thought it settled, and
perhaps for that reason and believing in the Constitution, we
have not done as much as we should have done to see to the
enforcement of the law. Perhaps we as women, not being in the
position to select men who should administer these laws, trusted
too much and needed the awakening which has come. We are
convinced that we have a good law--a righteous law--written into
the Constitution of the United States--that it does not in any
way affect the personal liberty of well-doers--those loyal to the
highest interests of the country and the great majority of the
people.</tt> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><tt>We are not satisfied that the law is
being enforced in all places. We are sure it will be when the
Nation has had time to adjust itself. In a well-regulated home it
is the policy of a mother to work faithfully and patiently,
knowing that perfect obedience requires law and discipline. It is
never the policy of a good mother or teacher to say the children
are disobedient--therefore let us give in to them and let them do
as they like.</tt> </font></p>
