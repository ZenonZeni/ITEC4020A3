<center><h1>Alternative Therapies</h1>
<h2>Slowly gaining mainstream acceptance </h2>

<h6>by Charlotte Gerson, President, The Gerson Institute</h6></center>

On January 1, 1996, the Los Angeles Times carried a front page article titled New Life for Old Remedies.  We felt this to be a very important development.  Our members and other friends will surely find it encouraging that "old remedies" (the true healing
 of herbs, nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathy, etc.), according to this article, are once again finding acceptance.  Since orthodox doctors, too, are spokesmen, we would like to report in some detail on this front-page news article.<p>
The article"s subtitle reads: "No longer dismissed as fringe ideas, such "traditional" therapies as acupuncture and herbs are going mainstream.  Once-wary doctors are using them to complement conventional medicine." The article was written by Marlene Cimons, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer.  <P>
The article opens with a report on a patient suffering cruelly from one of the most violent pains known: trigeminal neuralgia.  The pain is caused by a nerve inflammation in the cheek.  Narcotics and nerve blocks gave this patient only little relief, and 
had severe side effects: the patient was unable to sleep, couldn't concentrate and suffered from depression.   The physician who was finally consulted, Dr. Brian Berman in Baltimore used homeopathic remedies, derived from herbs.  Within six months, the pain receded by two-thirds.  The patient continues to use these remedies, and is able to keep the pain under control.<P>
The author continues: "Now many other doctors are beginning to do the same thing.  They have discovered that integrating the unconventional with the mainstream not only can provide relief but also can do so with fewer side effects and without more invasive procedures, such as surgery." More and more scientific evidence is strengthening approaches once considered radical or alternative, that are now being considered "complementary".   The article claims that many physicians, "even those most resistant to alternative medicine," are now taking a second look.  The article quotes Dr. Nancy Dickey, a family practice physician, chair of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association, a most conservative even reactionary organization.  Dr. Dickey admitted that "if I had a patient who said, "I quit using codeine since I started doing acupuncture", I'd say, "Terrific"."<p>
Since these so-called "alternative" methods are, in fact, the ancient and original approaches to treatment of illness, they are actually "traditional" medicine.  Outside of the United States, they are referred to as such.  According to the World Health Organization of the United Nations, 65% to 80% of the world’s health care services are what we would call alternative.  Dr. Wayne B.  Jonas, director of the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), is quoted as saying that "These 
become complementary, alternative or unconventional when used in Western countries.  Even in countries where modern Western biomedicine dominates, the public makes extensive use of unconventional practices."<p>
A 1990 study showed that one in three Americans saw an alternative health care practitioner that year.  More than 80% used alternatives in conjunction with conventional medicine, according to the NIH.   However, an item in The Cancer Chronicles, published
 by People Against Cancer, discusses a summer 1993 convention of the AMA, in the course of which delegates proposed a resolution condemning "recognition and endorsement of non-scientific alternative medical care paltriness".  This was done in the name of 
"freedom and patient's rights"! According to the logic of B. J. Kennedy, MD, a delegate from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, "Use of these therapies interferes with patients' access to regular medical care."<p>
According to a report under the heading of "Abstracts" in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, January 1996, Vol.  2, No.  1, "A survey by David Eisenberg and colleagues indicated that in 1990, consumers made an estimated 425 million 
visits to providers of alternative therapies (they also made 388 million visits to primary care physicians) and spent $13.7 billion , mostly out-of-pocket (they spent $12.8 billion out-of-pocket for all hospitalizations during the same period).  It was estimated that one of three Americans used alternative therapies in 1990, and most did not tell their physicians they were using these therapies." <p>
After the results were in from a carefully designed questionnaire, the journal continues, "180 physicians returned completed questionnaires; 70% to 90% considered many alternative therapies to be legitimate and a majority had referred patients to nonphysicians or used these therapies in their own practice.  Of the respondents, 70% expressed interest in training in multiple areas of alternative medicine."<p>
Medical schools are beginning to add training in alternative therapies to their curricula.  "Insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plans have begun to cover alternative treatments in part," the author continues, "because they often cost less than standard procedures, and also because customers want them."<p>
A most interesting item follows: it seems that physicians themselves have become "consumers of alternative medicine" says Dr. James Gordon, chairman of the program advisory council of the NIH’s OAM.  "I've certainly seen physicians change because they had
 a health problem that was not helped by conventional therapy."  Dr. Gordon had injured his back and obtained no relief from "orthodox" remedies, but was apparently helped by an osteopath. <P> 
"The NIH's Jonas points out that a new drug's average "half-life" or period of peak use is about 20 years.  Homeopathy has been around, unchanged, for almost 200 years, acupuncture for more than 2,000 years, prayer and spiritualism for at least 20,000 years.  And if one believes reports of monkeys using plant products to regulate their menstrual cycles, herbalism, probably the oldest, has been around for greater than 200,000 years." <p>
Homeopathy was originally introduced from Europe by Dr. Hahnemann and is based on the idea of "like cures like".  Homeopathy consists of treating a disease by giving highly diluted preparations of substances that, in larger doses, actually cause the same 
symptoms.   The author of the article quotes several success stories with alternative medicine, including that of the wife of a physician, herself a nurse, who could not stand the side effects of the painkillers she was taking to treat fibromyalgia.  She 
was highly skeptical but, with acupuncture, homeopathy and herbs, she could wean herself off drugs.  [The wife of a patient at the Gerson Treatment Center, who was suffering from fibromyalgia, was cleared of her pain in three days by simply eating the organic vegetarian, unsalted foods served at the hospital.] <p>
Many doctors are still resistant to alternative medicine, partly because they feel that there is not enough scientific evidence demonstrating its effectiveness, and that most of what evidence there is, though striking, is "anecdotal".  Dr. Berman predicts
 that it will take another decade for society to undergo a major transformation in its acceptance of alternative therapies.  He feels it will only happen when there is enough "scientific" evidence to prove these therapies effective.  The author also admits that even though doctors are more and more willing to turn to alternative medicine, the medical establishment in the United States is so strong that it is still able to define what "health care" should be.   Physicians are still being taught that alternatives are mostly folk medicine, supposedly a "less evolved" form of medicine.<P>
The fact remains, however, that the public is becoming demonstrably more disenchanted with the ineffective treatments of allopathic, technological medicine, especially for degenerative diseases, and is "voting with their feet" by their patronage of alternative practitioners, for the ancient methods that still work.<p>
