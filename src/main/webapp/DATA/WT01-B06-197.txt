<TITLE>McDonald's Unhappy Meals</TITLE>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff" TEXT="#000040"><H1><B>The Sad Side of Happy Meals: Involuntary Imports</B>

</H1><P>

<P><B>I have a beef with McDonald's.  While their hamburgers are made with

All-American beef, their Happy Meals usually include a plastic toy that is

made in China.  Most Americans consider McDonald's to be as American as apple

pie, but as the company drifts farther from the vision of its Founding Father,

Roy Kroc, it becomes less and less patriotic.  One of these days the corporate

bean counters will start importing beef from Argentina and Roy Kroc will

turn over in his grave.</B>

<P><B>Sadly, Kroc's beliefs died with him at age 82 in 1984.   Roy Kroc believed

in America and in making his products "All-American."  He proudly required

that all McDonald's hamburgers contain only U.S. beef and that they be labeled

"Made in the USA."  </B>

<P><B>McDonald's obviously imports the Happy Meal's little plastic pieces

to make its arches more golden.     But McDonald's Kroc said "If you just

work for the money, you'll never make it, but if you love what you're doing

and you always put customers first, success will be yours."  Most McDonald's

customers don't want imported items surreptitiously slipped into their lunch

boxes.  By doing so, McDonald's is force feeding America involuntary

imports.</B>

<P><B>Surely, McDonald's customers would pay an extra nickel to get a true

All-American Happy Meal.  Though the Happy Meal is just an "All-American

Meal" (hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and a drink) with a ten cent imported

toy.  Let's just call it an "Un-American Meal."</B>

<P><B>Last month China became the number one country in terms of a trade

imbalance with the United States, surpassing Japan.  Remarkably, the United

States does not use its economic leverage against China to promote democracy

or oppose its abysmal human rights record.  In addition, China has a vast

network of more than 1,000 prison camps where political prisoners and other

inmates manufacture products for export.  These prison factories make plastic

toys, games, and hundreds of other products that wind up on the shelves of

Toys-R-Us and Wal-Mart, and could very well make it into your Happy Meal

container.</B>

<P><B>"Involuntary imports" are products that the purchasers believe are

made in the USA, thought they are actually manufactured overseas.   McDonald's

is not the only company to blame for these involuntary imports.  The small

toys found in Happy Meals, guaranteed to last 24 hours before breaking, are

commissioned by Disney, Tonka, the Flintstones, Barbie, Cabbage Patch and

Animaniacs.  While all of these toys were originally created in the United

States, none of them are made here now.</B>

<P><B>When Sears or Wal-Mart fails to make American products available on

their shelves, they also make us involuntary importers.  When you go into

J.C. Penney's or Macy's or Nordstrom to buy an American shirt, only to find

that none are available, and you are reluctantly forced to buy an import,

you make an involuntary purchasing decision.  When you buy a pair of Nike

shoes without realizing they were made overseas, you areinvoluntarily buying

an import.</B>

<P><B>There are many fine, inexpensive American products that would make

excellent Happy Meal companions.  For example, Crayola crayons with a coloring

book, a small Little Tikes toy and baseball cards are three examplesthat

are Made in the USA.  In fact, baseball cards would probably create more

repeat customers than many</B> <B>current Happy Meal trinkets, with youngsters

trying to get their favorite players.</B>

<P><B>So the next time you walk into a McDonald's, wake up and smell the

coffee.  Don't buy a Happy Meal.  Write to McDonald's at Kroc Drive, Oak

Brook, Illinois 60521 and tell them that you want your Happy Meals to be

made in the USA.  Or send McDonald's an e-mail at mcdfct@ibm.net.  Roy Kroc

would be proud of you.</B>
