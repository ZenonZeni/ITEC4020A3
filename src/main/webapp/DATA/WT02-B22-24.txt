<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>beautiful
<LI>i love humping the screen
<LI>Easier than buying magazines
<LI>It is all over the place however it can be avoided with practice or supervision
<LI>people writing true sex stories
<LI>people writing trues stories
<LI>I'm in favor of it because the worst thing that could happen is that you get a computer virus...
<LI>Love it bring it on
<LI>Sound and progressive
<LI>Shouldn't hve to pay...
<LI>It should be available to adults.  Those areas should be accessed by passwords that are given out after proof of age has been checked.
<LI>It is probably adding to the immorality of society, much like the sixties and seventies.  However, I don't feel that we should totally rid ourselves of it.  Parents should use security software to prevent access to pornography web sites, news groups, ircs, etc.
<LI>I like it, but I think it's bad for me.
<LI>It is there and if I want to find something to relate to it I am sure I will.  Sex is the #1 human drive let's not make it something perverse.
<LI>Too hard or too soft, but not much sensual in between.
<LI>For geeks only. The real thing in the real world is better.
<LI>its fun
<LI>i love porn
<LI>You can't have sex online, you can only exchange sexually-oriented media, which is a lousy substitute -- like "near beer."
<LI>its weak
<LI>i don't find very explicity images
<LI>I think it's great! Sex on the internet provides an outlet for any type of tension you might have... It's also a great turn-on. My girlfriend and I have had sex while talking on irc many times.
<LI>I think that there should be online sex site, as long as they do not contain pictures relating to pedophilia or any other illegal sexual pictures
<LI>I LOVE it!
<LI>I am surprised ayt the treatment women ( or those with female logins) get on some of the Chat sites.  I think that there may be a danger of devaluing sex for younger net users who often seem to be the most "foul" on the net.
<LI>With our generation being so "open" it's just natural that this be the next step.
<LI>for losers who can't get a real sex life.
<LI>I discuss with my friends and even my instructors that there should not be a governmental regulation of sex on the net.  If so, why is there sex on tv and in magazines.  I thought that God created humans in his form, so why are we covering it up?
<LI>internet shpuld provide a url on personal experineces for other users to enjoy and read
<LI>YAHOO!!!
<LI>THE ULTIMATE SAFE SEX
<LI>If the Govn't is going to stop sex on the Internet, then I guess they will have to stop it at the book stores, magazine stands, TV, movies, music and so on.... It is up to the parents/guardians to ensure the children are educated about sex and monitored.  Making it against the law only makes it more apealing.  
<LI>I'm glad that it can be expressed openly...in this day and age it is necessary to be able to access information if it is needed.
<LI>we see ppl die on tv daily, why not see ppl make love?
<LI>should be used as an information tool not.to educate
<LI>no harm 
<LI>Sex on the net is a harmless outlet for sexual fustrations and fantasies. However it is hard to find without a major credit card, therefore much remains in my imagination.
<LI>I am still exploring it, so no comment as of yet.
<LI>Haven't had much exposure to it. This survey is the first.
<LI>There should be more
<LI>i love sex.  sex on the internet gets me hard and wet.  mmm  mmm good!  ooooh yeah  give it to me some more    faster harder faster harder
<LI>establish some kind of rating system for sites essentially.
<LI>It is a wonderful to open up to people and truly discover the depth of your own sexuality.  I feel like a sexual being now... I am liberated.
<LI>The internet stimulates the imagination.  The imagination needs to be utilized more by people as a way of spicing the sex life up.
<LI>no censors please, let me do it myself
<LI>i wish there were more ways to interact with other horny people on it. i might just not know how to find it yet though.
<LI>I like it.
<LI>I believe that it is good to have on the internet.NO A.I.D.S
<LI>Sex on the internet provides a location that allows the sampling of various forms of sexuality from mild to bizarre
<LI>its grrrrrrrrrrrreat!!
<LI>Well I love to try to find pictures of womens feet.  I really love long toes that have red polish on them and that is really hard to find.  I wish it was eathier to locate then it is.
<LI>I love Sex, The internet is okay
<LI>where is it?
<LI>i would like more sex stories and pictures
<LI>I have been on only a short time.  I don't see the access the news media seems to have.  It takes money.
<LI>Sex links were the primory reason I persued net access.  I have found other stuff too, but sex was my primary intrest.
<LI>It's fun, but a lot of it is in very poor taste. It is also very easy for minors to get access to.
<LI>I haven't found much yet
<LI>great 
<LI>yes,it is gooood
<LI>not mucht
<LI>Very fun!
<LI>Why doe this shit cost so much????
<LI>Difficult to find generally - but some interesting areas
<LI>Tragic that people are living such sheltered lives that they prefer the canned sex of the internet to the real pleasures of sex in marriage!
<LI>It may well be the last bastion of sexually explicit material. lets keep it that way!
<LI>The "problem" is vastly over-rated -- the potential for both good and harm is great, but it must remain a matter of indivdual responsibility.
<LI>LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE ITS THERE IF YOU WANT IT, IF NOT DON'T LOOK AT IT.
<LI>Actually, I already answered that in question #13.
<LI>I can find anything that interest me on the net
<LI>my friend rachel likes to touch herself while on line.  consider a "talk dirty" segment to help her stimulate herself
<LI>Sex in the internet is a source of knowledge to promote how aids and other sexual desease will afect a person.. Also for entertainment.
<LI>valuable tool for a variety of stimulus
<LI>Sex is not the only thing you should pay attention in the Net. There's much more dangerous material available, such as instructions for building a bomb.
<LI>Ok, as long as there are ways to keep children off the sex pages.
<LI>Pornography and other social illnesses are nothing new. What the Internet does is provide "home delivery".
<LI>I believe Sex on the Internet is fine.  I think that males are more visually stimultated than women.  And for that reason pornography on the "net" allows me to view material in another medium.
<LI>It's better than phone sex, because you don't have to hold the reciever.
<LI>I am new to the internet and haven't had too much experience with it. I hope to view more and I believe that people have the right to be sexually "free".  The problem with children start in the home and sex education is the solution to all those who can't control themselves or their children.  I was educated and i appreciate and respect all sex if it doesn't harm anyone participating.  
<LI>the net should be completely open
<LI>Socialists promote it.  It should all be removed from the NET, as it is a private matter.
<LI>I feel that it enables safe contact with sexual desires without having to worry about cheating, or coming in contact with any sort of std's.
<LI>I would like to see more information about homosexuality.
<LI>I would like to see more information abour homosexuality.
<LI>I think its a good forum of sexual topics
<LI>I believe that any for of restriction in the access to infomation is dangerous.  The world in general needs to be better educated in making their own moral judgments and not for their restrictiveness onto others.  Parents should be pro-active in this, not reactive.
<LI>its ok
<LI>Everybody does it. Everybody likes it. So open the internet for it.
<LI>Can show people many things, some bads some goods, but mostly bad things: in the sens of morality!!!
<LI>It takes money to access the internet; I'm supposed to accept that parents purchase this access yet never want to take responsibility for what there children access.  It tends to follow the current trend of society in that the people never want to accept any responsibilities, but rather set the responsibilities on others and complain.
<LI>It's great..i love it!!
<LI>i love it i cum all the time
<LI>n/a
<LI>I want to got all!!
<LI>its cool.
<LI>Very intriguing, an outlet, not something I would ever allow my children to access
<LI>Most of my experience with sex on the Net has been in chat rooms, where I have a few regulars "partners". My fiance is aware and approves of this. We borrow ideas used in my "play time" as well as monitoring the other's sexual escapades without the knowle
<LI>It's great, I wish I could Find More - Better stuff.
<LI>I like sex on the internet.  
<LI>ITS COOL TO BROWSE AND LATER TRY WITH YOUR SPOUSE!
<LI>anything goes
<LI>ITS COOL TO BROWSE AND LATER TRY WITH YOUR SPOUSE!
<LI>Given the inferior graphics compared to video or film, I don't know why anyone would bother. Besides, sex clubs are much more invigorating!
<LI>It's empty, but entertaining
<LI>just curious&want to learn more
<LI>When is someone going to figure out how to transport themselve through the computer?
<LI>I love to masterbate while surfing the net
<LI>It's Great
<LI>it's nothing like the real thing but you take what you can get
<LI>helps me understand my needs and wants and what other types of sex and displays of such to explore.
<LI>I'm glad it's there/here as I don't get it anywhere else.
<LI>I think that there should be a club for this kind of thing
<LI>Well, I can't say that I have !!
<LI>Sex & Internet is just another part of real life and should continue forever.
<LI>I'll take the old fashioned face-to-face meeting people anytime.
<LI>I enjoy this 1st amendment activity
<LI>I love sex, I wish you had more about bestiality!!!!!!!!
<LI>Cool!
<LI>Governments must not attempt to legislate morality.
<LI>It's ok, but it not the same as the real thing.
<LI>I think it is nice and good but you should find it easier
<LI>I DON'T MIND SEX ON THE INTERNET IF THE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE NO ACCESS, AND NO GROSS PICTURES SUCH AS AUTOPSIES.
<LI>I don't appreciate the pictures at the bottom of the page.
<LI>No Answer
<LI>The more the better
<LI>We love it!!!!!!!
<LI>Sex on the internet is fantastic! No one should take it away!
<LI>I can't really get a hold of alot of it to make a decision.
<LI>I think it is very good that it exists
<LI>I've hard pronography in European bookstores--harder than any in the States.  I've not seen anything that I'd consider hard core on the net yet.
<LI>very prevalent
<LI>cool
<LI>A lot of good things.
<LI>I am all for sex on the internet.  I fell that there should be more easily accesable hardcore.  I also feel that it is the parents responsiblitie to control their children.
<LI>I only wish it were real.
<LI>I THINK CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN ABOUT SEX NOW INSTEAD OF WHEN THEY END UP GETTING THAT GIRL PREGNANT
<LI>so far I haven't seen anything too disturbing, none of which can't be found in other locatons such as magazines
<LI>so far I haven't seen anything too disturbing, none of which can't be found in other locatons such as magazines
<LI>i dont mind at all
<LI>need more of it
<LI>Hi, well, what I think is if you're a horney intelligent, young female, and you want to talk to a horney, intelligent,hard and fun male...... you should e mail me at bart4032.@tao.sosc.osshe.edu  we'll have fun!!! bye!
<LI>I love hearing about, talking about and especially paticipating in all kinds of horney and kinky sex. I also feel that sex on the internet or phone sex is a healthy way to live and experience some of ou're deepest darkest sexual fantasies, or is fun for "fucking" around..... In fact if you're a horney, intelligent, young and wet female and you would like to talk to a horney, intelligent, young male, you are invited to send me ANY of your fantasies .I would love to hear you!! Send to   bart4032.@tao.sos
.osshe.edu   mmmmmmm it'll be fun!!!
<LI>There isn't enough, and what there is seems no worse (or better) than newsagents' top shelf stuff.
<LI>I am very intrigued and have longing fascination for the subject of sex, having sex and the sexuality of my (especially female) fellow human beings. I feel that sex can be a healthy and natural way to explore your self and the people you are closest to. also , in short.... Sex just feels soooooo good !!! bye.
<LI>there should be more beastiality and no service charge for pictures.
<LI>cool idea, but how do you know people only answer it once?
<LI>There definately should be looser restrictions on pornography... And faster phone lines, some of those files are large.
<LI>Assists fantasies
<LI>It's a new experience
<LI>I think it is great. Thanks!
<LI>benign harmless fun, however that is how I met my fiance :)
<LI>as a newbie I can not seem to find anything that my provider has not censored.
<LI>I love it
<LI>It's FUCKING GREAT!
<LI>It is wonderful, and I feel it should continue.
<LI>I think it is ok and if you have a problem then don't look
<LI>I would like to learn more about it.
<LI>a goldmine
<LI>Nothing Wrong With It
<LI>I think it is great. If you don't want to see it, don,t look
<LI>It is OK, but should be some what guarded.
<LI>I like the content but downloads are slow, Spiders everywhere
<LI>I don't see any harm for people of age
<LI>I think it is great.  It gives me a chance to learn what kinds of different people are out there.  It is also a lot of fun.
<LI>I love it!!
<LI>i like it
<LI>New to internet.  Somewhat surprised at openess of net, but I don't see anything wrong with it.  Government is sure to take some stupid action.
<LI>its great
<LI>I love sex
<LI>I wish photos and online letters were not censored
<LI>I wish it were more interactive!
<LI>If there was more of it , it would be great
<LI>good. can be expanded upon here and there.
<LI>there is way to much of it and to easy to get into
<LI>Good for me, but would not want my kids to see it.
<LI>SAVES ME MUCH MONEY AT THE NUDEY BOOKSTORE
<LI>really, i prefer the real sex
<LI>I like sex, but I don't care for the internet too much.
<LI>I wish one would not have to subscribe all the time. Subscribtions cost money and then one has to turn the computer off with a big disapointment. I also wish they had more movies
<LI>sex is everywhere, why not the internet?  it's how we all got here.
<LI>COOL
<LI>I think that there is a place for sex on the internet.  However, I think that there needs to be some guidlines and maybe even a rating system established.  I was e-mailed a pornographic picture and felt offended.  There was no reason that should have hepp
<LI>harmless-fun-challenging
<LI>Cool !
<LI>I like the Net.  I like sex.  I hope that the Net encourages more perversion so that society will crumble sooner.  Thanks and have a nice anarchy.
<LI>I use it purely to facilitate masturbation.
<LI>It could be instructive et pleased for a couple to see picture 
<LI>Its Ok
<LI>it sucks
<LI>because of the overload many sites receive there is a demand for this service. to take these services away from consenting adults because some parents can't control their kids is wrong. and if some uptight adult doesn't want to see the material hit the "back" key, most of the sites give plenty of notice to the content.
<LI>should be more open to public
<LI>It is a good way to explore areas of sexuality that I normally wouldn't
<LI>i dont know
<LI>i like it
<LI>It should stay. Let individuals make their own decisions.
<LI>very hard to access for a beginer
<LI>i'd rather not think about it
<LI>diffrent
<LI>not really sure
<LI>Great Entertainment
<LI>It's damn hard to find sex on the net. Censorship is unAmerican in any form.
<LI>I think that the Internet could be used for an excellent exchange of sexuality, but it seems to promote the more "deviant" side of sex.  There is a lot talk about homosexuality and even sex with children, and little talk about sex after a safe stable marriage relationship has occured.
<LI>Sex on the Net is what I do 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
<LI>***
<LI>Too difficult to locate and too control
<LI>hold on I"m spanking my monkey.
<LI>I don't know how to download dirty pictures!!
<LI>IT DOES NOT TURN ME ON, BUT HELPFUL TO MY FRIENDS
<LI>I think its awesome that we don't have to pay the outrageous prices that they charge for magazines at the newstand.  With the net, pictures can be looked at and downloaded for free, and for costs that are cheaper that the magazines.  That is the ultimate way to get satisfaction, free masterbation is the only kind of masterbation.  
<LI>I think it's great. I have fun looking for pictures and I met my fiancee online so I think there's nothing wrong with it.
<LI>Hiding sexual material on the internet only fosters curiosity in children.  Parents should be open with their children about sex and understand that just because sex material can be more explicit online than on tv it is far less exploited.  
<LI>I think it is very damaging to our nation.  At the least we should allow a key system which would be incoded by the POP to determine if a user is consered an adult (or have adult access) and a minor (or non-adult access).  If a system is registered as an adult group they can do basicly what they want (non-moderated) but if it is a non-adult group the group must be moderated.  Anyone providing a loop hole for non-adults to get adult accesses should be prosecuted.  To me this is a simple solution.  Freed
m of speech (or what we have perverted it to mean) and protection of our youth (or semi-protection because the prevers our still out there).
<LI>A whole new style to enjoy
<LI>Easiest way to find explicit material.
<LI>????????????????????
<LI>good for voyerism and ideas.
<LI>Its difficult to find non-member or non- censored stuff
<LI>Thank God for it! Now i don't go out looking and may have ended up dead! I can explore things safely on here. Questions, thoughts, all of it. Without embarassment.
<LI>AIDS and herpes makes sex more and more dangerous every day. The Net allows people to experience more and communicate more with people in a (for the most part) safe setting with no risk of disease. I'm all for more sex on this planet!
<LI>Mostly kinky and tasteless but a few good areas that deserve encouragement - above all we must as a community uphold the first amendment and all other parts of the Bill of Rights!
<LI>It would be helpful to the newest "Net-surfers" to have access to information concerning the downloading of all pictures.
<LI>Sex with a partner is infinitly better
<LI>great
<LI>boys will be boys, girls will be girls
<LI>pretty cool
<LI>great
<LI>Kids should not learn about sex on the net, education begins at home.
<LI>I think it's great you can learn more about sexually things and possible meet others interested in the same things.  I wish I could find more.
<LI>Very hot, I am fucking myself right now!!!
<LI>people like it, so it's going to stay on the Net, but I don't need it
<LI>It is great! In today's society- people need to be able to use computers.  What could be a better way than on your computer when working the wonderful world of sex and the Internet..
<LI>I think that it is okay to talk about sex and be open to all different opinions. People who want to see pictures of naked people and masturbate, or people who want to have cybersex, or even people who just want to learn more about sex should be able to co
<LI>Sex is part of life and part of democracy
<LI>It's great!!
<LI>Love it , keep it free and uncensored
<LI>Great if I new of all the networks
<LI>It's okay.
<LI>It started as safe fun and has led to unexpected true love.  I thought I was happily married....now I wonder why I was there in the first place.
<LI>I hate having to join a freakin www page in order to get stuff!!  Tha pisses me off!!!
<LI>its great,when you find it
<LI>It's fun for many people having "virtual" sex, and really helps some people develop flirting skills.
<LI>It is good.  I am able to find out some answers to questions that I've had.  It has opened my eyes to what is out there and what can be done.
<LI>Should be as open as possible, with clear indication of contents, so as to let the person chosse to continue or not.
<LI>amazing what people imagine/do
<LI>BEcause of this,,,my dad cheated on my mom!  I hate it!
<LI>The Net is a great place to read/write about anything. Sex is always going to be a topic of interest and will obviously be read/written about on the NEt.
<LI>Good!
<LI>I THINK THAT SEX ON THE NET IS FUN ADN CAN BE AN OUTLET FOR SEXUAL FRUSTRATION. I DO NOT FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE CENSOED. I FIND THAT IT CAN BE ACTUALLY PRETTY DIFFUCULT TO FIND SEX ON THE NET ANYWAYS!!
<LI>personally enjoy what I see. Favor childproofing, though. Too many parents can't/don't monitor their children 24hrs a day. WE are a society, they are OUR children!
<LI>I love it!There should be much more
<LI>I Think its cool
<LI>Frankly it is a way for children to learn, really learn, about sex.  My first experience was watching a porno at a friends house in 3rd grade.
<LI>It's pretty cool.
<LI>very good
<LI>INTRESTING
<LI>i think its great that adults can learn more about sex in the privacy of their own homes.
<LI>It is a citizen's right under the Constitution to be able to exercise freedom of speech.  Since access is private it should be up to one's own morality as to access.
<LI>I think that since it is a free country, we should have the freedom to expose people to a variety of subjects.  Sex is a natural part of life, and it's eventually the reader's choice as to whether or not they wish to read the material.
<LI>Its natural and healthy.
<LI>Revere Sex and its Power, don't objectify women or children, RESPECT women, men, children and animals.  Keep the sacred in sex.
<LI>I think it is ok.
<LI>I wish more sites did not require plastic, why not cash?
<LI>Disapointing
<LI>it rocks!!!!
<LI>I think that it is fine.
<LI>I wish there were more free jpeg photos. I like the stories
<LI>I think it's great?
<LI>It  is fine  and  it sould  be  left  alone.
<LI>i haven't had mush experience with it.
<LI>sucs dick
<LI>cool dude
<LI>Sex has a place on the net but sex places should be open and clear about what their sites contain so parents have an easier time regulating their children
<LI>I THINK IT IS GREAT TO HAVE THE OPTIONS WE DO ON THE NET, IF PARENTS DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS LOOKING, LET THEM DEAL WITH IT, IT IS NOT OUR PROBLEM IT IS THE PARENTS PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH.
<LI>cool!!!
<LI>very good pictures
<LI>If you want to access it you should be able to :)
<LI>I wish there was more
<LI>Wish it were more well organized and easier access to specific topics.
<LI>It's different and very interesting
<LI>perspective
<LI>I want to find more stories they turn me on. Where can I find them!?!
<LI>very interesting
<LI>it must be
<LI>people will get sexually explicit material anyway, the net is a safe alternative to some adult bookstores.
<LI>I think it is great
<LI>No too hard but beautiful!!
<LI>I WANT MORE!!!
<LI>I LIKE THE AMOUNT ON THERE.  I DON'T LOOK FOR HARD CORE, BUT LIKE TALKING DIRTY TO OTHERS.  IT'S A GOOD WAY TO RELEASE SEXUAL FRUSTRATION, AND IT'S HUMOUROUS!
<LI>I think sex on the net is great.It opens doors for free speach.SO KEEP IT CUMMING!
<LI>Sex is a part of our humanity and comes in many variations. The number and bizzarness of the variations will continue to grow as our directionless society grows bored with itself. The material on the 'net is some times stimulating but mostly boring and really lacks in artistry. There are exceptions, and no doubt the number of these will grow as use of the 'net grows but so will the proliferation of commercial sites and sites made by people who have no tallent at all.
<LI>Pretty Perved
<LI>Wow.  Too bad it isn't real.  Who ever thinks of the VR CUp first is sure to make billions of dollars instantly
<LI>Sex on the a something shared between consenting persons and the Internet is a sort of free press which does not intend to offend anybody but however, I do believe that a rating system is logical to help those who are supervising their children.
<LI>I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS?
<LI>From Chat rooms to News Groups, Sex is everywhere and too easilt accessable to children.
<LI>ITS GREAT FOR ADULT PEOPLE, BUT EASY ACCES FOR CHILDREN.
<LI>It has let me be more honest with my self and my desires.  I thought I was the only person who felt the way I do.
<LI>I think Sex on the Internet is wonderful.  It has broaden my mind and made want to try more things with my wife and myself.
<LI>good!!!
<LI>It is as variable as it is in the outside world.
<LI>not accseable and not esay to find
<LI>people worry to much!!!
<LI>if safe sex, okay 
<LI>It cracks me up...and people like Exon freaking out about it crack me up even more.
<LI>something cool to masturbate to.
<LI>no opinion
<LI>It gives a private way to learn about things you may not want to ask about of a friend or doctor.
<LI>for the things that can be openned gives me something to do on my spear time
<LI>what fun!
<LI>don't know much about it
<LI>No opinion--haven't found any
<LI>I like it.
<LI>Providing that politicians keep their damn hands of the internet, it will be the future of safe sex.
<LI>I think it is okay, but I am not wild about children gaining access. Also, it seems like everyone is so excited to post sex EVERYWHERE, so I am a bit disappointed (in us, as a society), but not really surprised.
<LI>I think that it is great, it helps me live out fantasies,things I couldn't do in real life.
<LI>If your curious, you can learn without being embarrased.
<LI>I don't belive it should be on here.
<LI>Sex is part of life, so is Internet
<LI>i love to wax down my stick and surf the net
<LI>I have just gone on line.  I am interested in many things including sex and I hope to explore further.
<LI>I think people should lighten up it's just for fun and those who abuse it do get caught so whats the harm. People should just spend a little more time with their children and stop worring so much about what they are seeing a on the net. Put some sort of password or something on thier internet conection so their unsupervised children can not get in.
<LI>I think sex on the internet is OK.  If people are looking for outlets for their frustrarions, or looking to see if ohter feel the way they do, they should have access.  IUf people want to look at pornography, let them, it is their choice
<LI>I think sex on the internet sholud be avaiable to everyone.
<LI>it is a great way to find answers.
<LI>brings out the horniness in me
<LI>i've found some rather interesting information regarding sex....i would also like to say that the only way that i was able to find the hard-core sex stuff was through a post on what are your kids seeing on the internet....ironic huh???
<LI>It's great stuff.
<LI>I'm new at this so no idea.
<LI>A MAJOR FORCE IN THE NETS CONTINUED GROWTH
<LI>No government intervention, let people take personal resposibility for their actions.
<LI>I like it, because i am horny as hell
<LI>I like the fact you can speak openly and honestly with others
<LI>I think it's great, because I find some of it very informative.
<LI>I do not think that the government has any right to censor what people are allowed to show, but I do think that parents have a great responcibility, along with the people who are making pornagraphy public... a rating system would help, but would be totally ineffective without help from the parents.
<LI>it's a good thing
<LI>i love them both
<LI>No comment
<LI>I wonder if what I see on the Internet really reflects what people desire/ want/ crave / are, etc.  Is this just an American phenomena?
<LI>I think the religious right should leave the net alone.
<LI>It is very interesting and should be allowed
<LI>not much
<LI>Sex on the Internet is great and provides a great escape for those who are not getting it
<LI>This is a lot of harmless fun- and difficult to access.
<LI>Good!
<LI>It would be nice to have more interaction with other people.Also,more dirty pictures of fetish interests would be appreciated
<LI>It is fantastic.  You can get around government legislation totally on this type of material.  It should be more accessable and all of the critics should enjoy sex more by using it.
<LI>Please,give me more erotic pictures!!
<LI>It's starting to be too much question about creditcard when you want access to places whit sexual oriented stuff.
<LI>more more more
<LI>It's great
<LI>very exciting
<LI>good
<LI>I love IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I think Sex on the Internet is great you can DO THINGS with other people you meet and not be guilty of cheating on your boyfriend /girlfriend... Plus its SAFE SEX!
<LI>Wish it was easier to find the Realy Good Stuf.
<LI>It's very erotic.  It gets me horny!!!
<LI>I think it's great, there is less embarassment since there's no need to walk into a video store and confront people with your sexuality.
<LI>The Internet is the perfect place to relieve sexual frustrations. It is harmless. As long as it is not used to harm anyone else, I believe that it is alright.
<LI>I think that the internet and related electronic information services promote free communication, the transfer if ideas and useful information, and a safe environment in which to experiment, meet new people, and learn abour different facets of one's self.
<LI>need more 
<LI>Personally, I think it's the best thing to happen in terms of both safe sex and personal self-esteem in ages.  On the Net, no one has to hide behind a socially acceptable mask, and a person gets the opportunity to mentally bolster themselves.
<LI>opened my mind to all types of choices for myself and my wife.
<LI>I have just started visiting sites, but feel I will be able to meet with others with similar interests throught the net.
<LI>I THINK SEX ON THE NET IS A FUN RECREATIONAL PAST TIME. HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN CATCH A COMPUTER VIRUS FROM CYBER-SEX.:-)
<LI>very good
<LI>cool!!!
<LI>Sex is good.  The Internet is good.  Sex + the Net = good.
<LI>There should be alot more of it!!
<LI>I think the pornographic phots that can so easily be downloaded should be eradicated completely from such an open forum like the Net.  
<LI>ok...dont let youngsters see stuff they shouldnt
<LI>like i said if you like it look if not dont!!!!
<LI>Just like sex in real life..when I want it..I REALLY want it!  When I don't..I get really sick of guys not taking no for an answer.
<LI>Thanks for it!!!
<LI>I'm tired of censorship and goverment intervention in my private life!
<LI>I'm new on the net so I can't tell much about that.
<LI>great
<LI>No comments
<LI>I think it is fine if you don't like it don't use that part of the net.
<LI>It´s a good way to connect people who are in the same vibrations - I hope so!!
<LI>what sex?
<LI>It's a great way to express your desires and not be embarrassed
<LI>I think it's a great way of exploring different sexual preferences, desires.
<LI>Not realyy experienced much
<LI>I would very like to be able to access harder pornography than at present. As you can see my interests are possibly frowned on by society but everybody should ba able to access what they want and freely.
<LI>I think number 16 says it all.  If you are looking at porn, you have gone through a great amount of time, effort, and just plain searching to get to a site with "real" pornogrophy.  Then the site gets shut down bcause of traffic . . .
<LI>Never expected the net to play a role in my sexual life
<LI>It should not be regulated, except by self regulation.
<LI>Don't get enough of what I really want. Wife not kinky enough for me.
<LI>very slow downloads
<LI>I think its a great representation of the freedom of the net
<LI>Those engineering students use up all the GPU time looking at Nudies!  That picks my ass!
<LI>I think it is an outlet for sexual frustration
<LI>interesting
<LI>This is the first page I've come accross about sex and I've been looking for about 10 minutes now.
<LI>Sex is great.. I met my girlfriend on the net, and hope to meet a male lover online.
<LI>I think sex on the NET is cool but I just wih it were easier to find the really good stuff....
<LI>i think that it is a good reliever of stress
<LI>I love it
<LI>It provides info
<LI>Parents must have the capability to "lock out" their children from porno material on the web, end of story.
<LI>i love sex on the net
<LI>For those who seek it I have no problem with, only it should not be every aspect of the internet and be limited to specific areas.
<LI>It' fun to browse
<LI>i think that everyone should be fucking their children in the ass 
<LI>Let those who don't want to see it, block it with some kind of security device/program. The Cable compnanies seem to handle this well, why not the net!
<LI>Sex is one of lifes greatest joys and can not be summed up in a sentance.
<LI>I beleive sex on the net is an excellent outlet for people that have built up anxieties and stress to express themselves openly and freely. I would rather hear that people are wacking off all the day and doing nothing with they're lives than venting their anger, physically, toward our society. Shit, Rabin was just shot. I should now eat my own words.
<LI>There should be more good content for free
<LI>to each his own
<LI>I am totally against censorship, all control of access shall be the responsibility of ISPs, authentication systems should be used where possible, they should be difficult for children to bypass.
<LI>if you want it,it should be there.
<LI>It rises the limits of the horizons of my soul on the matters concerning the sanctity of lunch meat.
<LI>I am 14 years old, and i really enjoy the newsgroup alt.sex.stories, it helps me let out sexual tention, and I don't think that parents should disaprove of children past puberty looking at pornografy, as long as it is not to hardcore.
<LI>i like it very much
<LI>Multimedia
<LI>it makes me get realy horny
<LI>I wish it was easier to find!
<LI>I think that there should be no restrictions on the net for people who have access to the hardcore picture files
<LI>It's a societal problem, not Internet's.  It's being scapegoated.
<LI>Sex is great, wouldn't live without it.  Internet needs more "AREAS" for open sex conversation.
<LI>The internet stinks of semen and acnecream... Doesn't bother me though...
<LI>Interesting
<LI>I think that sex should be a way of personal expression towards another you love, but as far as on the Internet, well you know people.
<LI>Sex rocks! The internet does it well.
<LI>I like all this fucking sex!!!
<LI>I love it i think that they should have more of it
<LI>Opens your mind to new things!
<LI>Many in fact most areas of the internet are depraved, sick and I am personally surprised that nothing more has been done to remove it
<LI>I Love It!!
<LI>To hard to get an overview
<LI>i like it but it should not be seen by children
<LI>ok
<LI>I find nothing wrong with "sex" on the internet.  There are way to may steps to go through to access porn on the internet not including the WWW and most the hard core stuff if First Virtural or some form of payment is required.
<LI>That's why I am on-line most of the time.
<LI>I'm going to sleep now. Good luck.
<LI>i don't get much sex at home so i look on the net and it should no be regulated
<LI>Go
<LI>I have no problem with it ay all.
<LI>The varieties of new taste!
<LI>look and feel
<LI>If the stuff is illegal off the net, it should be illegal on the net. There should be a rating system as well, and then a way to automatically block areas with ratings you don't want.
<LI>i like free sex, and i think that the parent has to have a complete control under their childrens. (i don't speak too much english)
<LI>Internet is a tool,no censsorship should be tolerated.
<LI>it rocks my world
<LI>i wish i could find more
<LI>NO COMMENT
<LI>it's not as perverse as i thought it would be.  some of it is actually educational
<LI>I think that it is a good means of "safe sex" but in a way it also incouarges sexual perversion.  It is also too easy for children to access.
<LI>I would like to know how to access the information.  I find it  very difficult to find anything at all on the internet yet alone something that Itruly have to look for due to some rich politician that doesn't want it to be known that their child actuallly started this whole controversy.
<LI>Keep it up.
<LI>Allows one to explore sex uninhibited and ask questions that otherwise one would feel uncomfortable asking other let alone a total stranger, and yet trust the information given. The truth can be told with no consewquences.
<LI>People are making way too big a deal of it...if you are really into porn you're going to get it anyway...for most people they experiment a little and then quit.
<LI>Kewl!
<LI>nothing
<LI>BORING!!!!!
<LI>its kinda cool sometimes
<LI>It's great, but harmless
<LI>I think it is great for the curious, and a good outlet for those who can't afford 'commercial' sex mags
<LI>I love sex, the internet is only ok.
<LI>Wish I could find more. Its a nice outlet for fantasy and imagination
<LI>Bad idea 
<LI>i see nothing wrong with it
<LI>I want to get fucked on the internet.
<LI>overrated
<LI>The only free sites are in usenet newsgroups
<LI>very hot, if you know where to look.
<LI>I think it is great
<LI>It provides access to sexual things you stupid #$!#$# loser! Didn't you know that already
<LI>You could learn some things about it on the net.
<LI>Free speech must continue for the benifit of truth.
<LI>I wish  there was more free stuff, free dl's.. i hate paying
<LI>Should be continued
<LI>it can be fun
<LI>Im mexican gay and some times a nide somthing in spanish
<LI>i don't know, I like it, and want to see more videos of it
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is an excellent form of safe-sex and a great way to have fun.
<LI>IT SHOULD BE ENTIRELY BANNED
<LI>I havn't spent much time looking for it.  I have been using the internet mostly for gathering information and email.  I plan on checking out some sex sites on the internet, though.
<LI>good !
<LI>Their are no good stories or good pictures
<LI>THE GOOD STUFF IS BLOCKED BY MY COMPANY.  WHERE ARE THE ROOMS TO HAVE CYBER-SEX??
<LI>Sex is awesome, plain and simple.  Sex on the net is by far overrated compared to the real thing.
<LI>I love it!
<LI>Is very beautyful
<LI>I think it's only natural, this is just another area of life and sex is a parte of life.  It is a little more prolific here, because people can talk without fear of discovery: they don't have to let others know who they are to share their feelings.
<LI>Intense
<LI>I think that the beneficial information available on the net far outweigh the few questionable sites
<LI>My Japanese girlfriend says that sexual topics in Japan are not something to hide, ergo the internet is giving Americans an outlet for that (in USA) ashamed interest.
<LI>ok for consenting adults
<LI>it is informative,and i am a voyeur
<LI>i wish there was more sex on the net yeah!!!!!!!
<LI>Free speach
<LI>Interesting, but greatly overblown by the media.
<LI>nothing special...
<LI>I just stumbled on it today, and I could not believe all of the sick and perverted things I came across.  From gays, lesbians, weirdos, etc...   Are my boyfriend and I the only normal and straight people left?
<LI>DIDN'T KNOW IT EXISTED TILL NOW...SOUNDS LIKE FUN!
<LI>I think sex on the internet provides a natural, private means of people getting their sexual needs filled. It beats going to the adult bookstores for those who do.
<LI>there might be more pictures
<LI>there might be more pictures
<LI>boring
<LI>It's entertaining, and many of the articles on human sexuality have actually helped my relationship.  A little enternet voyeurism with your lover before bedtime,  why not?
<LI>Over-rated.
<LI>I think it is wonderful and it helps me get-off!!!!
<LI>it's great
<LI>I think it's a great new device for information and a way to interact with other people in ways you'd normally be considered a freak or pervert.  I think it's good.
<LI>Mostly harmless fun...
<LI>Its just a format to talk, thats all,its up to you as to whaT
<LI>Sex should always stay on the internet.. openly.
<LI>I do not see anything wrong with it.
<LI>I would do it everyday if possible!
<LI>a great place to pick up horny chicks.
<LI>I'm curious to see stuff.  I think sex on the net(safe sex, no violence or discrimination) is an interesting way to stimulate the imagination (like magazines or books).
<LI>I think it is a safe way for people to explore their sexuality.
<LI>oh yes Pinky
<LI>It, potentially, could be a great thing, but it isn't.
<LI>Good stuff
<LI>has allowed me to become more sexual..has opened new sexual doors to me  ..has greatly pleased me
<LI>It's interesting to view and at times ejoyable
<LI>pritty two dementional
<LI>not enough panty pictures
<LI>it is OK
<LI>I really would like it to be easier to access but I understand why it isn't
<LI>I think it gets annoying.
<LI>It's great
<LI>I think it provides a way to add spice to any relationship.
<LI>I LIKE IT
<LI>too inexperienced on internet to know(a few weeks), but very curious
<LI>it has potential
<LI>I'd like to see more accessability to the hard-core stuff.  I believe that the US Government should stay out of our Cyberlives and not even try to regulate Sex on the Net.
<LI>The internet is a good outlet for sexual frustration if you are on the lean side of dating right now.  At least there are conversations you can have with the opposite sex without feeling intimidated about a date.  
<LI>I'd like to see more accessability to the hard-core stuff.  I believe that the US Government should stay out of our Cyberlives and not even try to regulate Sex on the Net.
<LI>Sex is great, especialy on the net
<LI>I think it is cool.  Anything ileagal such as children in porn, should be caught, and put away, but otherwise let it be.  It is not hurting anyone.
<LI>I don't have a problem with it in general.  I do with kiddie porn though.
<LI>Keep it up!!!!!
<LI>need more picture and a chance to talk "dirty" to others based on your sexual preferences.
<LI>its incredible
<LI>I love it!
<LI>The net is a reflection of our culture which sex is a part of
<LI>I'm very open about sex.  The Internet is one way to learn and communicate about sex. 
<LI>i want to know more
<LI>it's kinky.  I love hard core sex.
<LI>SEX IS GOOD
<LI>I enjoy it.  I think its safe fun for adults and quite erotic.
<LI>The internet is finally a place where most people are themselves, and it proves just how curious people are in sex, and such.  The internet should NOT be regulated, by anyone but the servers, and the users.  Just like that "V" chip they want to put into TV's to block sex, and violence, there should be an option when you get service, or evertime you login, to activate a censoring program, with a password, only available to those over 18, or 21 (depending on state)
<LI>The internet is a free place; so all natural things are present.
<LI>nothing wrong with it
<LI>I am still looking for some real porno on the net. As for kids seeing it ITS THE PARENTS FAULT there are many locks that can be put on.
<LI>its ok if it stays in the right hands.
<LI>It is a good source to get ideas and be creative.
<LI>If you've got both sets of equipment, call me!!
<LI>I believe that sexual openness should not be discouraged on the net, but in the same sense it shouldn't be exposed to children during thier developimental years. The reprpocussions for damaging childrens psychological development is not a burden that any one one entity would admit to bear or take reponsibility for.
<LI>It's done pretty well. It gives good exposure to those who want it.
<LI>MORE!
<LI>Fun, fun, fun
<LI>it is a good way to say things you wouldn't normally, it helps most people be more open to their feelings
<LI>It there .... Just search for it ... and ye shall find!
<LI>It is easy to acsess sexual material on the net.
<LI>no censorship....kids should be protected by parents/guardians
<LI>i get off everyday using the internet,i even giz on my screen once in a while
<LI>Do not regulate anything on the internet!!
<LI>cool!
<LI>Sex is part of our life. Why shouldn't it be a part of the internet?
<LI>the only problem is people who view sex as bad
<LI>I think that it's a wonderful thing.
<LI>Sex on the internet should be limited to mild erotica, in consideration of photography.  There should not be any photographs of children dealing with any aspect of nudity.  The written text should be limited to mild to intermediate sexual presence.
<LI>where can i find more!
<LI>I don't think it is a problem and I like it sort of.
<LI>The media has blown it out of proportion, which isn't surprising really.  If you're not looking for sex, then it is very unlikely that you will find it accidentally.
<LI>without alt.sex.stories and alt.binaries.pictures.errotica.whatever, we cyberpunks would have to actually pay for playboys (or playgirls...)!  how horrid!
<LI>As an adult, I think it should be left up to the people.  If I wish to see it, I should be able to, I'm fed up with others telling me what I should be able to do, I'm not a young child and the internet is not my mother. As far as kids, I brought mine up to respect my wishes and they know what I permit them to see/do and I haven't been let down. They're open, and so am I with each other, maybe others should open up their relationships with each other an find out how each of us are different, individual,
and have our personal desires.  Thanks for letting me put this thought here,
<LI>I believe it is a very important facet of our society, so therefore should be an important part of the 'net'.
<LI>Need more pornogrphic pages and fewer links to links to links of pornographic pages getting you nowhere.  Plus, I want to see some hermaphrodites
<LI>It's keeping me up to late!
<LI>awesome
<LI>If it does it for you, then proceed
<LI>I love it, I have sex here every night.  Well, not here, but on the net!!!!!!
<LI>Aside from the annoying 900 number spams, I see nothing wrong with it.
<LI>the video & picture quality is not worth all the fuss, and you can find the same stuff anywhere if you are looking for it.
<LI>I would like sex on the internet to be freely open to everyone. It is getting harder to access such things, and our sillyheaded government isn't going to make it any easier. 
<LI>I think it the hottest most wonderful thing!
<LI>I think it's overrated and only a small % of porno is on the net.
<LI>like the access
<LI>Love them both
<LI>it rocks
<LI>Wish there was more of it
<LI>I think that people tend to overestimate the amount and availability of pornography on the Net. 
<LI>I think it is what America craves
<LI>Sometimes it is just pleasant to watch.  I only see my girlfriend every once in a while It's nice to stay in touch.
<LI>I haven't had any experience, yet.
<LI>Screw the gov't; parents are to blame for children's access. If parants can't control their children, they shouldn't have had kids in the first place. No one is forcing them to have kids.
<LI>wow!
<LI>It's a great way to meet people
<LI>I think it is Ok for adults and should be clean and healthy.
<LI>I love the idea! In fact there should be more about crossdressing
<LI>I love it, I love smut and I cant get enough!
<LI>I think it is great!
<LI>i think on sex on the net is bad because it can be accessed by those people who are at the very tip of thier teenage.This would defenitely have a very bad impact on them..and unless science can come up wiyh ways to check this i believe it should not be allowed to take a place on the net.
<LI>I AM NEW TO THE INTERNET LOOKING FORWARD TO A NEW EXPERIENCE
<LI>interesting; maybe we can learn the truth about what's in the closet.
<LI>just 2-D it has no depth.
<LI>Any sort of regulation that actively affects the way the Internet operates will not be tolerated.
<LI>I think its o.k. in some cases
<LI>excellent! I just need to find a left-handed mouse.
<LI>I'm new to the net, I want sex talk and pictures, HELP
<LI>I think that it's not that influential, and that is should remain open.
<LI>It is every where! I see no problem - yet!
<LI>Too commercialized! I spend hours roaming and searching - and inevitably end up with "Send Us Money!" Where is the juicy stuff? I am getting really annoyed, you know!
<LI>There's certainly a lot of interesting stuff.
<LI>I think it is great and very safe.
<LI>interesting
<LI>Sex???...Please,the sex is natutal.The War,no
<LI>This is a democracy, jam-packed with 1st amendment rights, tell the conservatives to cool off!
<LI>I think there needs to be more pictures and stories of teenager girls making love to one another.  I also think there should be more erotic incest story for those who find it a turn on!
<LI>I feel that sexual resources are a good start for outlet, curosity, and they are harmless, PROVIDING there is no child pornography involved!
<LI>Sex is fun, The internet is fun, I haven't put them together.
<LI>I don't think stories and pictures cause any harm. I haven't seen anything too hideous, so perhaps I'm not qualified to answer. I do not have irc access at this time either. (Soon.)
<LI>Very nice!
<LI>I think it's very good.
<LI>I like both!
<LI>I have not found much material. Some friends have but not me.
<LI>i think its great!
<LI>With something as open as the internet, it doesn't surprise me, that sex is so abundant. I find simulated net-sex to be kind of silly, but I am not personally offended. To me it is much better than real-life promiscuity. I do worry about the concepts of "sexual freedom" that seem to be promoted in some areas, though.
<LI>it´s fun
<LI>Looked at the erotic binaries and erotic literature, but nothing else.  Didn't know there were online personals (although it certainly makes sense).  I like the idea of this survey!
<LI>n/a
<LI>IT'S GREAT. NEVER REMOVE IT!!!
<LI>Cool because it's open and free.
<LI>I can't wait til someone makes a monkey homepage so that I can fuck them in my dreams.  I want to play with my little penis while I Cum on someones head.  I want to get payed to shit on someones face and stick beads up my butt and pull them out.  I want everyone to know that I am a fucking sick person!! Thankyou. :)  
<LI>It's everywhere: porno, gifs, bmps, au, docs. 
<LI>haven't looked, therefore, haven't found
<LI>It's a matter of personal preference.
<LI>I love sex and the interrnet.  Why not mix the two!
<LI>The net needs more FAQ's and informational sites
<LI>Ilove both!!
<LI>GREAT FUN
<LI>It's an opportunity to overcome inhibitions. Just be oneself and enjoy life. We only live once - go for it!!
<LI>Think its a good place to learn, discuss and judge sex and sexual information
<LI>Yes its nice to read and see
<LI>its just another way of expressing freedom of choice on a system that is not regulated
<LI>Like any mode of communication, it has the capacity to be either used well or abused.
<LI>some sites have an educational value
<LI>great i want more!
<LI>Sex-not yet experienced     internet- Great
<LI>i like it
<LI>I'm very curious as to what it offers. I think its exciting, and I would love to find another way to channel my sexual energy.
<LI>i really haven't found any useful material, just a lot of pictures of naked women.
<LI>I think that it should be more hardporno fore does who want it. I have trouble finding what i want. "Jimmy"
<LI>The keyboard makes my penis hurt.
<LI>By leaving the censoring to local or national governmental control, you open up a can of worms to this question:  what does pornography entail?  Everyone will have a different view.  If you go to the solution of local control, people who post things could be penalized in one state, but not in another.  If you leave it to to national control, people see this as heavy censorship...where will they draw the line.  What is new with the internet, is that the international boudaries are not as heavy...  Contr
l of pornographic material will have to be self-censorship by parents and legal guardians.  It's just like putting childproof locks on the household cleaners cupboard.  Household cleaners are obviously poisonous, so you take precautions to prevent a child from getting into them until they understand the pros and cons.  Porn on the net should be handled the same way.  
<LI>Absolutely no problem at all. If you want to see it, there it is. If not, then just don't look.
<LI>All you prudes can go hide behind your Bibles.  This is the last unregulated vehicle for free expression.
<LI>amazing
<LI>keep it coming
<LI>We need more!!
<LI>When you work on for a big Internet provider like I do I form many opinons.
<LI>more cumshots freely delivered!
<LI>fuck you
<LI>The way it should be right now.
<LI>the internet has so many topics of interest from a-z, sex is one of those topics
<LI>Its fun! Focus on the positive. Control access/maintain freedom.
<LI>I'm not looking for sex on the internet
<LI>What you think about sex is not for government intervention, only what you you do about sex should be of societies concern.
<LI>The internet is a good free way of finding pornographic material on the cheap but some of the stuff is very hard and possibly contravenes some of the laws of he country.  But all in all a good system.
<LI>i think that sex on the net is totally cool. it is the ultimate in safe sex.
<LI>I think of sex on the net the same way that I look at sex in general, it's healthy and good.
<LI>It's called Freedom of Choice! and parents, control your KIDS!!!
<LI>It´s cool!!! And you are learning somenthing if you are under 13 (me).
<LI>Since I haven't got any lately I don't see any problem
<LI>Like it !
<LI>I think it provides an open, safe outlet for normal feelings. People will act on these feeling one way or another. The net is safer than the streets.
<LI>I don´t know enough, but I´d like to know more.
<LI>Sex is fun, Internet is fun. Combining two fun things can lead to more fun :-)
<LI>I need a cigarette!...
<LI>Open it up!
<LI>A valuble and interesting way to broaden horizons and view the phsyche of human kind, a representation of an unregulated form of communication.  Perhaps a model of an unregulated society.  Actually pretty scary given the possibility of educational value.
<LI>The internet is a free sex zone. As it should be.
<LI>cool...would like to know how to chat on line with others
<LI>'s okay!
<LI>Way too many perverted people out there!
<LI>no
<LI>great
<LI>If I could find it I would tell you.  I'm still a virgin on the net.
<LI>The I-net should be free of any or all censorship. Lest we forget the key role that the internet played during the aborted Russian coup. If we start on offending pornography, do we stop when we hurt peoples feelings with words. We cannot censor a free exchange of ideas no matter how distasteful. It should be the parents responsibilty to teach the children what is right and wrong.
<LI>I have no thoughts because I have not found anything on the INTERENET that I would consider Sex or pornography.
<LI>i like it a lot
<LI>i like it a lot
<LI>i love it
<LI>Blown out of perportion
<LI>NEED MORE!!!
<LI>interesting outlet for exploring new ideas
<LI>I don't find anything wrong with it on the internet
<LI>There should be more penetration shots
<LI>Thousands of people who would never dare buy a Penthouse magazine because of the fear of someone seeing them can now do it. Inhibitions exist for a reason, they are our gage between right and wrong. If I did not think it was wrong to buy a Penthouse magaz
<LI>Sex should be easy to obtain on the internet if it truely is a tool for and of the users. People hung up on censorship should not query sexually implied pages. I still assume we do not live under military rule!
<LI>its ok
<LI>easier access to nudes and movies
<LI>sex is great!!!  Have sex often!! It's fun!! keep sex on the net!!!
<LI>a healty combination is expected
<LI>I've been looking for more of it, just can't find enough ! :)
<LI>The internet was established for exchange of data...let's keep it that way.  If you don't want to find sex on the net...either go to a server that doesn't offer that type of material or one that censors everything.
<LI>Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<LI>i love it :-)
<LI>It's fun--and if people don't like it--they should not look at it!!!
<LI>I would like to see more i have tried to find it it is hard 
<LI>love it
<LI>What they have in common are keyboards
<LI>It's an obsession.
<LI>it's great
<LI>i have no time for it but if people choose to spend their money masturbating at a keyboard then it is their business. There should be some way to stop insulting instant messages to people who want to recieve IM's but not get into cybersex. Maybe a key that awakens the so called regulators and they could stop any porn there. If they are talking sex in aroom well then its the individuals responsibility to cchange rooms. No one is chaining you to your keyboard and forcing you to watch.
<LI>it seems to be self regulated, that is, sites are posted, and advance warnings are present to avoid being surprised or viewing something that would offend.
<LI>It's a safe place to have it and it's fun.
<LI>Censorship is the parents job, not the governments.

<LI>have only pornography
<LI>Parents should take the time to block out unwanted material. If a person knows or comes to know that a particular site is offensive, those people should stay away or lock that material out of their system. The real problem is that those people who want to
<LI>have the parents be responsible for their children
<LI>Parental control "lock out" features.  Make parents realize they must accept full responsibilty for their child.  Do not force government or other sanctioning bodies to regulate material.
<LI>Anal Rape and a nice ham on rye (if you know what I mean, wink wink)

<LI>it should be allowed with a key pasword to adults over 18
