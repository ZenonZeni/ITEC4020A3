UTILITY WORKS TO CHANGE NDE CRITERIA FOR
GENERATOR TUBES

In the coming months, Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)
plans to spend $3-4 million to help develop new
nondestructive examination criteria for cracked steam
generator tubing in nuclear reactors.  If approved by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the new criteria
would, for the first time, allow some circumferentially
cracked tubes to remain in service.

ComEd's action is prompted by the discovery in November
of about 2,000 indications of circumferential cracking in the
steam generator tubes of the utility's Byron-1 nuclear reactor.
Because of the extensive cracking, the utility has proposed to
pull 10 tubes from Byron-1 -- one of the largest tube pulls in
the U.S. to date.  The tubes will be used to validate NDE
crack detection and sizing techniques as well as estimate leak
rate and burst data.

ComEd will be working with the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), which is leading the nuclear industry's
efforts to develop new plugging criteria for cracked steam
generator tubes.  Circumferentially cracked tubes traditionally
have been plugged upon discovery.  However, with
extensive cracking being found in several plants around the
country, large-scale plugging is threatening the economic
viability of some reactors.

EPRI's project to develop alternate plugging criteria is being
carried out by three contractors -- Westinghouse, Zetec, and
Aptech -- which are developing NDE techniques and stress
corrosion cracking samples for inspector qualification testing.

EPRI recently ironed out an agreement among all major
nuclear vendors on the NDE parameters for sizing
circumferential cracking in non-sleeved tubes.  The agreement
should help to yield a consistent set of inspection data when
reactors around the country undergo their next outages.

The inspection data collected during the outages, and from
laboratory testing, will be used to develop approximate flaw
growth rates for cracking tubes.  Being able to accurately
predict how fast cracks will grow is essential for reducing the
chance of a tube rupture.

The means to assess crack growth rates took on even more
importance in November when EPRI submitted a proposal to
the NRC to allow known circumferential cracks to remain in
service so that their growth rates can be tracked.  EPRI
proposed that a cracked tube could be boxed in by plugging
all the surrounding tubes so that, if a rupture occurred,
damage to nearby tubes would be minimized.  The NRC has
accepted the proposal with some reservations, but has not yet
made a final decision.

ComEd technicians hope that by pulling tubes from Byron-1,
they can gather data about crack growth rates and NDE
detection capabilities that could be applied to Braidwood-1,
another ComEd reactor.  Commonwealth is seeking to make
Braidwood a lead plant for implementation of alternate
plugging criteria for top of the tube sheet circumferential
cracking.

ComEd technicians recently found 25 indications of
circumferential cracking at Braidwood, which has a similar
design to Byron.  The utility is preparing itself in case the
extensive cracking that occurred at Byron happens at
Braidwood as well.  Braidwood-1 has two cycles and Byron-
1 has two and a half cycles remaining before their steam
generators are scheduled to be replaced.

Commonwealth has already been able to obtain an alternate
plugging criterion for another problem at Byron and
Braidwood: outer diameter stress corrosion cracking at the
tube support plates.  In November, the NRC approved a 3-
volt eddy current criterion, which is the highest to date.
NRC's traditional criteria is more stringent, requiring utilities
to plug reactor steam generator tubes when an eddy current
reading of one volt or greater is detected.

NRC's approval of the higher voltage standard included a
requirement to lock in a number of tubes into the tube support
plates.  ComEd estimates that using the higher voltage
threshold could save it from plugging 1,020 tubes at Byron-1
and 913 tubes at Braidwood-1.  This would result in a
combined savings of at least $5.7 million.

The agency's decision is an important indication that a 3-volt
threshold may come into wider use by the NRC.  Although
the criterion applied only to ComEd, Westinghouse, which
designed Byron and Braidwood, is expected to seek a generic
approval of the new threshold.

IOWA STATE DEVELOPS NDT TECHNIQUE FOR
GLOBAL INSPECTIONS

Researchers at Iowa State University have developed a new
NDT technique called GlobalView that achieves the global
inspection of objects of all sizes using ultrasound.  Its
inventors say the technique has a variety of applications
ranging from inspections of civil structures and airframes to
earth crust monitoring.

The GlobalView technique, also known as spread spectrum
nondestructive testing, combines ultrasonic testing with
technology from the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System
and radar signature analysis.  GlobalView transmits a very
wide bandwidth ultrasonic signal that floods the test object or
structure with acoustic energy.  As with traditional pulse-echo
ultrasonic systems, this signal propagates in the material and
is reflected by inhomogeneities which may be flaws.

However, unlike pulse-echo systems, which rely on the
transit time of the ultrasonic wave to locate flaws, the
GlobalView system measures the composite characteristic of
the entire acoustic system including the structure and the
transducers.  By measuring the cross-correlation functions
between the various input and output transducers, the system
can form an aggregate acoustic signature of an object or
structure.

The GlobalView unit compares the original, or reference,
acoustic signature with one taken at a later date to indicate the
presence of flaws or to determine if changes in the object
have occurred.  By taking an object's acoustic signature, the
system can detect changes in the object's characteristics such
as volume, shape, dimension, composition, density,
homogeneity, and acoustic velocity.

The signal processing used with this wideband signal is
capable of increasing the sensitivity of the measurement by
many orders of magnitude beyond what is possible with
conventional ultrasonic testing.  Thus, the instrument can
penetrate highly-attenuative materials.

Iowa State researchers, led by principal investigators Steve
Russell, Samuel Wormley, and Emmanuel Papadakis, have
built and tested two prototype systems.  The first system
mainly consists of software that is used in conjunction with
commercially-available ultrasonic instrumentation.  The
second prototype is mainly hardware, using analog methods
for most of the signal processing.

While the software approach provides maximum flexibility,
researchers say the hardware approach would be less
expensive to manufacture and would have faster processing
times.

The technique is particularly useful for inspecting objects
with "blind spots" or other geometries that prevent the use of
pulse-echo or pitch catch ultrasonic techniques.  Parts or
structures composed of high attenuation materials or with
restricted access are also good candidates for GlobalView.

Researchers have found that the technique can distinguish
between flaws because different types of changes or identical
changes in different locations show up uniquely in the
correlation signature.  GlobalView has been successful in
locating small flaws in copper blocks, small steel assembly
line parts, and large sections of bridge structure.

The developers say GlobalView will make it possible to
perform continuous, low-cost, monitoring of bridges and
airframes and other critical structures.  For example,
airframes could be automatically monitored before each
takeoff to insure structural integrity while avoiding expensive
down time for detailed inspections.

However, the technique also has applications beyond
traditional NDT tasks.  Earthquake fault zones could be
monitored for changes below the surface of the earth to help
predict earthquakes.  GlobalView could also be used for oil
exploration by creating an acoustic signal that penetrates deep
into the earth's crust.

NRC AUDITS WESTINGHOUSE FOR MISSED
INSPECTIONS

In October, a four-person team of auditors from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) visited a Westinghouse
testing facility in Pennsylvania to determine why the company
had failed to discover several obviously cracked steam
generator tubes during a 1993 inspection of the Salem-1
nuclear power plant.  NRC auditors are also seeking
information on why Westinghouse used an eddy current
probe that had not been fully qualified to inspect 4,000 tube
support intersections during the reactor's current outage.

According to Ted Sullivan, a section chief in NRC's Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulations, the agency has prepared a draft
audit report that is due to be finalized and released to the
public in January.  Sullivan said that the site visit to the
Westinghouse facility near Pittsburgh lasted from Oct. 23rd
to Oct. 27th.

The NRC began the audit after finding out that Westinghouse
technicians had used an 0.080-inch-diameter motorized
rotating pancake coil eddy current probe to inspect dented
intersections at Salem-1.  The Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) has approved the 0.080-inch-diameter probe
to detect cracks for tube support plates without dents, but not
at dented intersections.  EPRI has qualified an 0.115-inch
diameter probe for inspections of dented intersections.

While using EPRI-qualified probes is the industry norm,
inspection vendors and utilities can also approve
independently the use of other probes for specific tasks such
as inspecting dented tube support plate intersections.
However, there is the danger that flaws may be missed unless
the proper probe and instrumentation is used.

Westinghouse is trying to get the 0.080-inch-diameter probe
qualified by EPRI, but the company will most likely have to
re-inspect Salem-1's steam generators before the qualification
process is completed.

The NRC also wants to find out why Westinghouse
inspectors failed to detect a number of tubes with greater than
40% throughwall cracks during a 1993 outage at Salem-1.
These tubes had remained in service during the reactor's
operating cycle, although they should have been plugged
prior to restart.

The NRC has had to inspect the Salem-1 plant several times
over the last few years because of numerous operational
violations.  The agency has fined Public Service Electric &
Gas Co., Salem's operator, more than $2.3 million since
1980.

PARTNERS SCORE SUCCESS WITH ULTRASONIC
SENSOR

Morton International's Automotive Safety Products Division,
based in Utah, has adapted an ultrasonic system developed by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
inspect airbag inflators for welder verification and process
control.

Morton-ASP is the leading supplier of airbag inflators to the
automotive industry.  Under a cooperative research and
development agreement, NIST's Materials Reliability
Division in Boulder, Colo., worked with Morton engineers to
develop, test and install a prototype nondestructive testing
system for verifying that there are no anomalies associated
with the weld joint process of the mass-produced inflators.

A unique feature of this inspection system was the use of
electromagnetic acoustic transducers, or EMATs, which can
perform the necessary ultrasonic tests at high speed without
contaminating the part or the environment with couplant
fluids.

Off-line trials involved examining up to 100,000 inflators and
were so successful that Morton contracted Sonic Sensors of
San Luis Obispo, Calif., to build three commercial units.
These units are now installed on the production lines and
provide process control information on the welding
operations.

NAVAL CENTER MARKETS ITS NDE EXPERTISE TO
THE PRIVATE SECTOR

As defense budgets shrink, an increasing number of military
bases and research centers are marketing their R&D efforts to
the private sector.  The newest installation to join this list is
the Naval Surface Warfare Center located in Carderock, MD,
which is hoping to provide expertise in NDE sensors,
metallurgy, welding, and structural monitoring to the railroad
industry.

At a December 7th meeting, officials from the Center noted
that Navy and railroad operations overlap in many ways.
Navy ships require high-quality welds whose integrity must
be monitored nondestructively, as is also true for welded rail.
Moreover, maintenance and machinery diagnostics are
concerns for both parties.

The Warfare Center has developed several NDE sensors such
a portable coating analyzer for substrate/coating adhesion
assessment and acoustic weld sensors.  Warfare Center
officials hope that these types of technologies can be
transferred to the private sector through the use of cooperative
research and development agreements (CRADAs).

The number of CRADAs entered into by the Center pales in
comparison to many other military installations and officials
hope that meetings like the Dec. 7th event will increase this
total.  The Warfare Center currently employs more than 4,000
people, more than half of which are scientists and engineers.
The Center's fiscal year (FY) 1994 budget totaled $767
million, which included $312 million for research and
development of test and evaluation technologies.

NDT FINDS CRACKING AT TWO REACTORS

Engineers using nondestructive testing recently found steam
generator tube cracking in the Point Beach-2 nuclear power
plant operated by Wisconsin Electric Power Company and in
the Diablo Canyon-1 plant operated by Pacific Gas & Electric
Company.

At Point Beach-2, eddy current inspection discovered axial
defects in the reactor's steam generator tubes within the
tubesheet crevice.  Circumferential cracking was also found
in the parent tube of previously sleeved tubes near the upper
sleeve joint.  The crack findings extended Point Beach's
outage, which started on October 7th, by an extra two weeks.

Previous tube plugging and sleeving had already reduced
power in the two-loop 497-MWe reactor by 10-15 MWe.
Wisconsin Electric Power has applied to the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin for permission to replace the
reactor's steam generators during the plant's fall 1996
refueling outage.

Engineers at Diablo Canyon-1 in California recently
discovered 70 corroded tubes in one of the plant's steam
generators.  This finding pushed the number of pluggable
tubes at Diablo Canyon-1 over the threshold 1 percent of the
tubes tested.  Pacific Gas & Electric notified the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission as required by regulations and
expanded the testing program.

The testing involved extensive ultrasonic examinations and
engineers decided to pull several tubes for metallurgical
testing.

A total of 1.7% of Diablo Canyon-1's steam generator tubes
are now plugged.  The utility expects Diablo Canyon-1 to be
back in service sometime before January 30, 1996.

IN BRIEF

%  The American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT)
has a new site on the World Wide Web called "NDT Link."
ASNT can be reached at http://www.asnt.org/ndt.  The Web
site contains technical information, which is comprised
primarily of online articles from Materials Evaluation
magazine, society information, local society events, a
schedule of events, industry services, and links to other
NDT-related sites.  At this point, most of these areas lack
complete information, but hopefully in the near future the site
will be finished.

%  XiTec (Windsor Locks, CT), a leading manufacturer of
mini c-arm fluoroscopic imaging systems with applications in
health care, NDT and other industrial fields, recently reported
an increase in profits.  The company's net income for the first
quarter ended Oct. 31, 1995 amounted to $1.65 million, an
increase of 36.9% over the comparable prior year's period.
The quarterly revenue performance was the second best in the
company's history, falling short of the record fourth quarter
of last year by approximately 12 percent.  XiTec attributes its
increase in revenue to the market's continuing acceptance of
the company's XiScan 1000 track system coupled with
favorable results from increased emphasis in the marketing
and sales sectors.

%  In early December, dye penetrant inspection helped
engineers in California discover why a five-ton electronic
message board collapsed in Rancho Cucamonga, killing a
freeway motorist.  Caltrans engineers using dye penetrant
found several fractures in the signpost, ranging from
microscopic to several inches long, which were invisible to
the naked eye.  Caltrans is now inspecting each of the 228
signposts statewide.  At this point, no fractures have been
found on any other signposts.

%  With the help of ultrasonic testing, a 71-year old riverboat
is undergoing an overhaul in New Orleans, LA.  The
riverboat President is used for gambling on the Mississippi
river and is usually based in Davenport, Iowa.  Workers at
Trinity Gulf Repair will replace steel in the 297-foot
President's hull, if necessary, then sandblast and paint it.
Ultrasonic testing will determine if the bottom's steel meets
the prescribed 3/8-inch thickness.  Depending on the extent of
the repairs, the job could run as high as $750,000.

%  In early November, Asoma Instruments Inc. (Austin, TX),
a manufacturer of X-ray fluorescent analysis tools for
nondestructive testing, purchased Twin Cities Inc., which
makes products similar to Asoma's.  Asoma will provide
sales and field support for Twin Cities from its locations
around the world, while factory support for Twin Cities'
products will continue to be handled from an office in North
Tonawanda, NY.

FAA TIGHTENS WING INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

In late November, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
issued a series of airworthiness directives (ADs) intended to
improve nondestructive inspections on the wings of Airbus
A300-series, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, MD-11, and Air
Force KC-10A aircraft.

The AD applicable to Airbus A300-series transports requires
repetitive high frequency eddy current inspections to detect
cracks at the aft spar web of the wings.  The FAA's action
was prompted by reports that cracks have been found in the
rear spar web of the wings of an in-service airplane and
during fatigue testing on a test wing.

The cracking, which could result in reduced structural
integrity of the wing, occurred due to fatigue-related high
shear stress.  The directive affects 89 airplanes of U.S.
registry.

A second AD applies to McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, -30,
and -40 series airplanes, and KC-10A military airplanes.
This action requires repetitive visual inspections to detect
corrosion or cracking of the lower front spar cap and the skin
panel of the horizontal stabilizer, and repair of corroded or
cracked parts.

The spar cap must be modified according to a McDonnell
Douglas service bulletin before the accumulation of 42,000
total landings for DC-10-10 airplanes and before 30,000
landings for DC-10-30, -40, and KC-10A aircraft.  The AD
was prompted by reports indicating that corrosion, caused by
water entrapment, was found on the horizontal stabilizer in
these types of aircraft.

The FAA's new requirements affect approximately 286 DC-
10 and KC-10A aircraft worldwide, 142 of which are
registered in the U.S.  The FAA estimates it will cost
operators $20 million to comply with the AD.

The FAA also added extra inspection requirements for DC-
10-10 series planes.  In a separate AD, the agency is
requiring visual and eddy current inspections of the wings to
detect cracks in the aft spar lower cap, in certain stringer
butterfly clips on the bulkheads, and in certain fastener holes.
The FAA has found that, during fatigue testing of the wing
structure, cracks developed in these areas due to fatigue-
related stress.

The inspections must be performed before 15,000 landings
have accumulated and modifications to the affected parts must
be completed within five years of the AD.  The FAA
estimates that 53 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by
this AD, costing a total of $7.5 million for compliance.

Another AD requires eddy current inspections to detect
cracking of the upper spar angles on the left and right sides of
the wing pylons on McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplanes.
This inspection must be repeated if an aircraft experiences an
excessive maneuver, turbulence overload, or hard landing.
The upper spar angles must be replaced by Dec. 27, 2000.
Approximately 123 MD-11 aircraft worldwide are affected by
this action.

AFTER NDT DISCOVERS PROBLEMS, NRC BOOSTS
OVERSIGHT AT MILLSTONE REACTOR

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is adding
inspectors at the Millstone Station nuclear power plant in
Waterford, Connecticut after intensive nondestructive testing
turned up several faulty welds in piping systems that need to
be repaired.

In December, the NRC decided to place both a senior resident
inspector and resident inspector at each of the three Millstone
units.  Currently, one senior resident and four resident
inspectors are assigned to the site.

The NRC's action was prompted when the Millstone 3 unit
was taken offline in late November so workers could remove
insulation in the reactor coolant system and evaluate a leaking
valve that prevents water from backflowing in a 10-inch pipe.
During the inspection, workers discovered a defective weld
on one of four 3/4-inch pipes in the instrumentation for the
reactor coolant system.  Northeast Utilities, the reactor's
operator, decided to shut down the plant to repair the faulty
weld and to replace an additional 15 welds in the
instrumentation system as a precaution.

At the same time, an intensive ultrasonic inspection was made
of 154 welds in piping systems around the Millstone 1
reactor.  Inspectors discovered 11 welds that needed repair.
The utility is now using a robotic welding process to lay new
weld material over the old weld.

In addition to increasing its oversight of Millstone, the NRC
also sent Northeast Utilities a letter requesting information on
what actions the utility has taken to ensure that future
operation of Millstone 1 will be conducted in accordance with
its operating license and NRC regulations.  According to a
statement by the NRC, this request stems from the findings
by the NRC Acting Inspector General that certain activities at
Millstone 1 "may have been conducted in violation of license
requirements."

AGEMA DEVELOPS NEW THERMOGRAPHY SYSTEM
TO SEE BELOW THE SURFACE

Agema Infrared Systems has developed a new NDT
technique called "lock-in" thermography that can spot flaws
several millimeters below the surface of a material.  Its
developers say the new technique is faster and more accurate
than active thermographic inspection techniques.

Lock-in thermography is unlike either passive or active
thermographic techniques.  Passive thermography converts
infrared radiation emanating from an object into a thermal
picture of the object's surface.

In active thermography, an energy source such as a flashlamp
is aimed at the test object and the heat flow through the
specimen is measured.  Flaws in the specimen cause changes
in the heat flow which are detected by a thermal imaging
system.

While active thermography has the advantage of being a
noncontact technique, it also has certain drawbacks.  The
technique requires several lengthy tests to eliminate the effects
of different emissivities across the surface of a material.
Active techniques such as pulse thermography must take into
consideration the effects of ambient radiation and often
require high energy levels that can lead to unacceptable
heating of materials.

Lock-in thermography was developed to overcome the
limitations of both active and passive techniques.  In lock-in
thermography, a harmonically modulated source, usually in a
sinusoidal waveform, is used to energize the test material.
Defects in the material produce reflections that interfere with
the incoming waves and create a pattern that is detected by a
thermal imager.  The imager measures the signal amplitude of
four phase-correlated points on this wave and the results are
averaged.

A computer is used to interpret the measurements picked up
by the imager and to create amplitude and phase images of the
test object that are independent of ambient radiation and
variations in emissivity.  According to Agema, amplitude and
phase images of an object can be produced in a couple of
minutes using a high-speed computer.

The lock-in system is based on Agema's Thermovision 900
thermal imaging system which produces real-time
measurements and has 12-bit digital image processing.  The
unit also includes a dedicated system controller for high-
speed data processing and specially adapted software that
coverts thermographic measurements into amplitude and
phase images.  The system produces a pure sine wave that is
synchronized with the frequency of the Thermovision 900
scanner.

Lock-in thermography is being developed in partnership with
Stuttgart University and MTU Munich, a leading German
manufacturer of turbine blades.  The technique has been used
to inspect objects like an electronic resistor and a honeycomb
structure, but the researchers are now examining a wider
variety of materials.

To date, most of the tests have been carried out at frequencies
between 3.75 Hz and 0.03 Hz, giving depth rages of 3 mm
for non-metals and 10 mm for metals.  The next stage of
development will involve adapting the lock-in thermography
system for a range research environments.

NASA EVALUATES NDT TECHNIQUES FOR
COMPOSITES

Researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center in
Cleveland, Ohio recently completed a study that evaluated
various NDT methods for characterizing ceramic-, metal-,
and polymer-matrix composite materials.  The study found
that certain ultrasonic methods can provide quantitative data
on microstructural anomalies and that time-resolved
thermography can be a useful noncontact method for
detecting delaminations.

The researchers evaluated a method for obtaining precise
ultrasonic measurements and mapping which provides data
on sound velocities, coefficients of attenuation, and peak
frequencies of echoes.  Also evaluated was an acousto-
ultrasonic technique that generates data on velocities and rates
of decay of waves in plates.

Among the study's finding were that speeds of sound vary
with fractions of volume occupied by pores and fibers.
Researchers also determined that coefficients of attenuation
increase with degrees of inhomogeneity of volume fractions
of pores and fibers.

The researchers' results also confirmed the efficacy of using
time-resolved thermography as a noncontact, nonionizing
method for detecting anomalies such as delaminations.  The
method is particularly valuable because it requires access to
only one side of a specimen.  This allows the technique to be
used at more stages of fabrication and processing than other
NDT techniques that require access to both sides.

NDE Research for Navy

The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is interested in
receiving proposals for long range projects which offer
potential for advancement and improvement of naval
operations. Research areas of interest include the
development of new NDE probes, integration of various
probes into a single system, and more importantly, the
integration of NDE information with respect to materials and
structural properties.  The goal is to determine remaining life
of any structure based upon NDE data acquisition and
structural materials knowledge.  One or more examples of
any devices, components, or systems and software developed
under this effort shall be delivered for testing and
performance analysis by the Navy.  NRL is not interested in
