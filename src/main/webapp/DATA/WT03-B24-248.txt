<h1>The Hippocratic Oath vs Profits in Health</h1>
<h2>by Don Sloan</h2>

 <p>"There is no concrete evidence that would not allow for the 
patient to be discharged." That was the reply given recently 
by a nurse and her doctor supervisor at the other end of a 
long distance number at one of the major insurance carriers 
in the country to my request that my patient be authorized 
for a fourth post-op day in the hospital after major 
surgery. Without such a sanction, the insurance company 
would deny payment to the hospital. This so-called "carve 
out" is aptly labeled. Hospitals are quickly learning not to 
bite the hand that feeds them. Sides are being drawn - on 
one are the patient and the doctor; on the other are the 
third party carriers and their extensions, the hospitals.</p>

 <p>This scenario is becoming commonplace in the daily workings 
of America's physicians and their insurance company bosses. 
For assured payments, the physician must now request 
permission for treatment of either a medical or surgical 
nature. Indeed, any form of hospitalization short of a life-
threatening emergency must first be cleared through the 
carrier's offices.</p>

 <p>How has this come about in these past few years? The answer 
is in the euphemism for a health care program for America. 
It is called managed care or competition, as engineered by 
the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and/or the 
Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), two forms of groups 
of physicians and their ancillary health care 
professionals.This is all very much a part of the equation 
we are coming to know as the Contract With America.</p>

 <p>All of the nation's physicians recently received a mailing 
from the various states' departments of Social Service. This 
is the same Medicaid that took several hits along the way 
during the Reagan and Bush administrations and is now 
heading for even greater dismemberment. What is the real 
message and intent of these newly contrived programs? That 
corporate America is finding ways to outsmart and 
outmaneuver the American medical community and the American 
people in trying to convince us that something is being done 
to improve our health care delivery.</p>
<p>The U.S. remains the world's only developed country without 
a comprehensive health care package for its citizens. The 
insurance industry, the only one along with organized 
baseball that is exempt from antitrust regulations, is 
continually seeking new ways and means and tricks to keep it 
that way. Thus, managed care, with a corporate mother and a 
congressional father, is being applied in the spirit of 
privatization of Medicaid and even Medicare. Indeed, 
Medicare has gone through changes this past decade that 
allowed for third-party carriers such as Blue Cross to 
supervise and disperse funds from the Medicare pool, all, of 
course, after skimming the pot as a commission. That all of 
these systems sop up an almost one-third in administrative 
expenses as compared to, for example, the ten percent in 
Canada, is no surprise. </p>

 <p>Once the insurance cabal got its proverbial feet in the 
door, it went for the whole picture, and it now dictates the 
lengths of hospital stay, the procedures allowed, and even 
the after discharge care. The penalty for disobedience or 
even resistance is severe. Carve outs are liberally applied, 
and after the hospitals are denied their reimbursements, the 
patients are left with the burden of payment. Many have been 
pestered by collection agencies. </p>

<p> Some of these standards for lengths of stay and procedural 
codes that are used for billing purposes are based on the 
Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) formula created for Medicare 
and adopted by most if not all of the insurance providers or 
on formulas of the carrier's own making. The goal is the 
same - to reduce the number of patient-hospital days to the 
barest minimum. The status of the patient has little to do 
with it. The physicians' fees are not affected in any direct 
way; they remain the same no matter the extent of the care 
offered the patient because they are preset by the code. 
Happily, the doctor can remain altruistic with regard to 
patient care. However, there are subtle penalties meted out 
for physicians who do not keep the short stay goals of the 
carrier in mind. </p>

<p> The insurance people are in an all out competition war. 
Medical services are being peddled like just another 
commodity. CEOs and heads of operations at the nation's 
multinationals are being wined and dined as a part of the 
hard sell. U.S. Healthcare, the Blues (Blue Cross/Blue 
Shield), Aetna and the others have hired high powered 
Madison Avenue agencies to hawk their wares to both the 
corporate buyer and the media listener and consumer. Many 
are using celebrities as a part of the glitz of this ad 
campaign.</p>

<h4> Merger Craze</h4>

 <p>More, in this now hectic atmosphere that is being created 
by Wall Street's merger craze, medicine as an industry is 
not escaping the rush. Just as Chemical and Chase are 
seeking to control more of the banking business business-
driven conglomerates are reaching out with their tentacles 
that are engulfing medical PPOs and hospitals. This type of 
consolidation alone would reshape the entire health care 
picture in America, putting more and more of the emphasis on 
profit, business, and net worth. </p>

 <p>In New York State, with the nation's largest Medicaid 
enrollment, it is no wonder that newly elected governor 
George Pataki, is already busy clearing the way for Medicaid 
to come under the control of a managed care unit. This is a 
part of his often announced plans for a privatization 
blueprint in general, which includes many other public 
services.</p>

<p> That mass mailing to doctors indicated that in certain 
areas in the state, such managed care is now mandatory. It 
is anyone's guess as to how soon the whole program will 
convert to such a status.</p>

 <p>Has the buying public benefited in any way? Are the doctors 
providing better care for their patients? Are hospital 
services more sensitive to patient needs? Are there any 
rewards for the buying public in the forms of reduced 
premiums or deductibles? The answer to all four is No! The 
hospitals are under the gun, as already noted, to obey the 
rules of the DRGs, and the timed discharges and their 
rewards, in the form of no carve-outs, are given only if the 
patients are discharged as quickly as possible. This past 
month, in a move that should have been embarrassing to the 
provider insurance company, Governor Christie Whitman of New 
Jersey used an executive order to allow post-cesarean women 
to stay three days instead of two in the hospital; other 
states are taking notice.</p>

<p> Doctors are seeing more and more patients in the same time 
frames with the obvious less astute care that comes with a 
fast take. Moreover, if anything, patient insurance premiums 
have risen. The funds have simply shifted from physicians 
and hospitals and other health providers to the insurance 
company coffers.</p>

<p> Medicaid's credibility is owed to the fact that it is the 
only plan available to the poor. But that is where it stops. 
Vast improvements are needed in the forms of more funding 
and more comprehensive services for all. The solution is 
within internal improvement and not in a sellout to private 
carriers. By the same token, physician control is also 
lacking. A plan to demystify, deglorify, and 
deprofessionalize the medical community is long overdue. The 
logical overseer would be a civilian review board. </p>

<p> Apparently, more and more states are encouraging their 
Medicaid participants to enroll in their strictly-for-profit 
HMOs, and this is happening all over. Florida is the first 
state to have started such a program and they are well under 
way. There followed the expected windfall of Medicaid monies 
into the HMOs. </p>

 <p>The subterfuge used is the claim that Medicare and Medicaid 
are not being gutted but "saved." The report that Medicare 
will be "broke" by the year 2002 is a trick at its best. As 
with Social Security, monies are being siphoned off from 
Medicare by every administration in a Peter-to-pay Paul 
arrangement. Peter is the entitlements that are for the 
people; Paul becomes the military complex and the Pentagon. </p>

<p> Another euphemism for fund cutting of the Medicaid program 
is the block grant. This is the plot out of the early Reagan 
years when monies for Medicaid were allocated in a lump sum, 
always bearing the boast that it is "more than enough." When 
the earmarked reserves are met, patients are denied medical 
care, either through a raise in the eligibility criteria or 
by just closing the doors of the health station or clinic. 
It is as simple as that. And as cruel.</p>

<p> The proverbial worm seems to have turned. The American 
medical community is awakening to its role on the side of 
the patient and opposed to the insurance industry and the 
health care conglomerate. It is regrettable that physician 
organizations are not oriented toward that thinking, 
although they may be in the future. The buying public has 
long been victimized by a system that placed them second to 
profit. It should welcome the doctors as a part of that 
equation. Until America joins the ranks of the other 
industrialized nations and provides its people with their 
rights to total health care, Medicare and Medicaid will have 
to suffice. Vigilance will be needed to protect what we have 
already fought for and won. </p>
