<P>
&quot;When my doctor did our postcoital test, she said Larry's
sperm were dead,&quot; Kelly M. told the RESOLVE group. &quot;She
also found some white blood cells. She thought one or both of
us might have an infection, so she ordered cultures on my cervical
mucus and Larry's semen. She also ran some tests to see if we
had sperm antibodies,&quot;
<P>
&quot;What did she find out?,&quot; the support group leader asked.
<P>
&quot;Well Larry's sperm survived in donor mucus. And donor sperm
survived in my mucus.''
<P>
&quot;Then what was killing Larry's sperm in your mucus?'' a woman
asked.
<P>
&quot;The cultures didn't show infection, so she said it was antibodies,&quot;
Kelly M. said. .&quot;My doctor told me that I was rejecting Larry's
sperm just like I might reject a kidney transplant.&quot;
<P>
&quot;What can you do about it?&quot; her friend asked.
<P>
&quot;Several things&quot;, Kelly answered. &quot;First, we want
to try washing Larry's sperm and using intrauterine insemination.
If we can get around my mucus, we may be able to get around the
antibody problem.&quot;
<P>
Kelly and Larry M. belong to a special group of infertile couples
whose problem we are just beginning to understand and resolve.
I'm very excited about the fertility research taking place in
the field of immunology. Antibodies, however, are only one reason
why cervical mucus may be hostile to sperm. Other mucus problems
may also impair their journey to the egg.
<P>
<B>Cervical Mucus: Protector and Pathway</B>
<br>
Acting as the gateway between the vagina and the uterus, the cervix
secretes a thick, impermeable mucus to plug the canal. Normally
this &quot;hostile&quot; mucus protects the woman's reproductive
tract from invading organisms and foreign particles. At the time
of ovulation, however, the mucus transforms into a &quot;friendly&quot;
path through which sperm can travel in safety. Under the influence
of estrogen the thick and sticky mucus becomes clear and stringy.
Like lanes in an Olympic swimming pool, tiny tubular paths form
to guide the sperm toward the uterus.
<P>
When the mucus fails to become &quot;friendly&quot; as it does
with 5 to 10 percent of all infertile women, the sperm cannot
safely begin their journey toward the egg. The hostile mucus,
as it is called, will either block the sperm's passage or will
damage the sperm so severely that they can no longer function.
The aim of fertility treatment is to restore the quality of the
mucus so it can:
<UL>
<LI>Facilitate or interfere with sperm transport at appropriate
times of the month
<LI>Protect the sperm from the acidic vaginal environment
<LI>Preserve the sperm in the cervical canal and release them
in a steady stream over a period of time
<LI>Filter out abnormal sperm
<LI>Protect the sperm from white blood cells which may destroy
them as they would invading microorganisms
<LI>Provide nutrients to the sperm
<LI>Prevent bacterial contamination of the uterus
</UL>

<B>Performing the Postcoital Test</B>
<br>
The postcoital test is the primary tool for diagnosing cervical
mucus problems. Performed at the time of ovulation, it assesses
mucus quality. When I examine the cervical mucus approximately
8 to 12 hours after intercourse, I look for three things:
<UL>
<LI>If the husband delivered good quantities of sperm to the cervix
<LI>If the sperm are swimming vigorously through the mucus
<LI>If white blood cells are present, indicating an infection
in either partner
</UL>

If the results of the test are good, I don't worry about the mucus
being a fertility problem. If the results are poor, I know that
a mucus interaction problem exists or that the test was performed
at the wrong time in the cycle (the most common reason for a poor
postcoital test). The best way to insure that the test is performed
at the correct time is to plan intercourse with a <a href="http://kerouac.pharm.uky.edu/hometest/Ovulate/OHP.html">urine LH test kit.</a>  Since we can predict ovulation more accurately than we could when only the BBT chart
was available, we are less likely to get poor results from poor
timing.
<P>
A number of factors can cause an abnormal postcoital test:
<UL>
<LI><I>Infection</I> in either partner (indicated by white blood
cells in the mucus) 
<LI><I>Sperm antibodies</I> produced by either partner will cause
the sperm to die, to agglutinate (clump together), and/or to shake.

<LI><I>Abnormal mucus quality:</I> High-viscosity and/or low-volume
mucus can block sperm. 
<LI><I>Abnormal semen</I>: Sperm antibodies produced by the man
as well as infections in the man can adversely affect test results,
as can a low sperm count and poor motility. 
<LI><I>Poor coital technique</I> or <I>ejaculation disorders</I>
can also prevent the sperm from reaching the cervix. 
</UL><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<img align=left src="ch152.gif">
<H2>Infections: Diagnosis and Treatment</H2>
<I><B>Diagnosis</B></I><br>
Infectious organisms in either partner may kill or maim sperm.
I suspect an infection if I find dead sperm, white blood cells,
and/or cellular debris in the postcoital specimen. Specific microorganisms
can often be identified by performing a culture of the cervical
mucus but, often I more it more cost effective to initially treat
each couple with a short course of antibiotics. In the presence
of white blood cells, however, I may prescribe an antibiotic even
if the culture comes back negative.
<P>
<I><B>Treatment</B></I>
<br>
Both partners must be treated to ensure that they are not passing
the disease back and forth. The semen and mucus cultures for Dan
and Marie C., for example, revealed the presence of chlamydia.
I prescribed an antibiotic (<a href="http://www.hovione.com/doxy/index.htm" target="new">doxycycline</a>) for both of them. To
avoid exposing an early pregnancy to antibiotics, Marie took the
medication during the ten days following the start of her menses.
<P>
If I continued to find white blood cells in Marie's mucus, I would
try to isolate the problem. To make sure Dan was not depositing
white blood cells with his sperm, I would ask them to abstain
from sex until just before their next postcoital. A normal semen
analysis and the presence of the white blood cells only immediately
following intercourse would tell me Marie was producing them in
response to Dan's semen, which could indicate a sperm antibody
problem. I was relieved when I found Marie's mucus free of white
blood cells after antibiotic therapy.
<P>
If treating an infection with antibiotics restores a normal post
coital test, up to 42 percent of the couples treated will conceive
within three months, and 84 percent within one year.
<H2>Testing for Sperm Antibodies</H2>
<I><B>The Sperm-Mucus Cross Tests</B></I>
<br>
Normally antibodies attack foreign substances invading your body.
For some unknown reason, however, 4 percent of all men produce
antibodies against their own sperm. (The incidence of this autoimmunity
increases from 4 percent to 50 to 60 percent in men with vasectomies.
The sperm antibodies are probably a protective mechanism to help
get rid of millions of unused, trapped sperm.) The effects of
antisperm antibodies will usually show up in the semen analysis:
the sperm may clump together (agglutinate) or shake in random
motions.
<P>
Sperm antibodies are also found in the cervical mucus of 30 percent
of women with unexplained infertility problems. If a fairly recent
semen analysis shows that unexposed sperm have normal forward
motility, but the postcoital test shows them shaking or clumping,
I'll suspect that the woman is the source of the sperm antibodies.

<P>
A sperm-mucus cross test will help me understand the exact nature
of a couple's sperm antibody problem.
<P>
John and Leslie P. were referred to me after four years of unexplained
infertility. John's semen analysis was normal and their cultures
were negative. When their family doctor did a postcoital, however,
he found dead sperm. Since they used a urinary LH test kit to
predict ovulation, I knew they had timed the test perfectly. The
couple obviously had a sperm-mucus interaction problem.
<P>
If I suspect an antibody problem, I can order special tests to
look for antibodies in the woman's blood, cervical mucus, and
attached to sperm using an immunobead sperm test.
<H2>Treatment for Antisperm Antibodies</H2>
<I><B>Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)</B></I>
<br>
When the sperm from the man are antibody-bound, they can achieve
only a 15.3 percent pregnancy rate. Sometimes, though, we can
reduce the adverse effects of the antibodies by having the man
ejaculate into a nutrient liquid, washing the semen from the sperm
and using them for <a href="insem.html">intrauterine
insemination</a>. When washing restores function to more
than half of the sperm, we can achieve a 66.7 percent pregnancy
rate.
<P>
IUI may also be helpful for women producing sperm antibodies.
This is what John and Leslie P. decided to try. By washing John's
sperm and injecting them directly into Leslie's uterus, we gave
his sperm a head start against her hostile mucus. I cautioned
them, however, that since Leslie's antibodies could be anywhere
in her genital tract, IUI might not work. Moreover, women with
sperm antibodies are twice as likely to have a spontaneous abortion.
If IUI didn't work, they might want to consider in vitro fertilization.
<P>
Although a sensitive pregnancy test showed a pregnancy after the
second insemination, Leslie's period started a week later. I was
sorry to tell them that she had probably aborted. They were not
discouraged; in fact, they were elated. Now they knew that John's
sperm could swim to her egg and fertilize it. Undaunted, they
continued with IUI two months later Leslie's period was late again.
We didn't   know whether or not to celebrate because she wasn't
out of the woods yet-and wouldn't be for a few months. We all
sighed a breath of relief when she entered her second trimester
with Mom and baby doing well-Dad too. Now they have a red-haired,
green-eyed baby girl who's made them forget they ever had a fertility
problem.
<P>
<I><B>Condom Therapy</B></I>
<br>
Use of condoms during intercourse for a prolonged period of time
may reduce the level of the woman's antibodies to the extent that
the sperm will not be affected. The woman must avoid all contact
with the man's sperm for three to six months; this includes oral
sex as well as skin contact. (If the man is producing antibodies
to his own sperm, however, condom therapy will not work.) Many
people do not want to go this time-consuming route and will elect
to use IUI instead. This method was more popular prior to availability
of IUI and has fallen out of favor because it is less successful.
<P>
<I><B>High-Dose Steroid Therapy</B></I>
<br>
Experimental therapy with high-dose steroids for men with antisperm
antibodies appears to produce a 30 to 40 percent pregnancy rate.
Although few studies have been done with women producing sperm
antibodies, steroid therapy may prove to be more effective than
condom therapy. In addition, suppressing the antibodies may diminish
the spontaneous-abortion risk. However, this therapy is not without
risk. High dose steroids result in loss of calcium from the bones.
 There have been cases reported where steroids used to treat infertility
have resulted in hip fractures requiring hip replacement surgery.
 At this time, I fell that the risk of this therapy is too great
to warrant its routine use. 
<P>
<I><B>In Vitro Fertilization</B></I>
<br>
By washing antibodies from the sperm and fertilizing the woman's
egg outside her body through in vitro, we can avoid exposure to
antibodies in the semen and in the mucus. Before attempting in
vitro fertilization, a hamster penetration test should be performed
on the man's sperm to ensure that once they are treated they will
be able to fertilize an egg.
<P>
Since sperm antibodies produced by the man or woman are associated
with a high spontaneous-abortion rate (50 percent), many couples
may wish to try IAIH first. IAIH is much less demanding on the
couple and quite a bit less expensive More research is needed
before in vitro can be considered a viable option for resolving
sperm antibody problems.
<P>
<B>Poor Mucus Quality</B>
<br>
Mucus viscosity and volume abnormalities may be caused by surgical
procedures performed on the cervix, by in utero DES exposure,
and by clomiphene citrate ovulation induction treatment. About
40 percent of the time a low-dose estrogen supplement will improve
mucus volume and viscosity.  However, I generally recommend IUI
to bypass the mucus problem as the result is more predictable.

<P>
Women suffering from cervical stenosis (scars sealing the cervix)
may respond to gradual dilation and estrogen therapy.
<b>Ejaculation Disturbances or Poor Coital Technique</b><br>
When the semen is poor or when the coital technique does not provide
an adequate supply of sperm to the cervix, the postcoital test
may appear abnormal, even though neither of these abnormalities
represents a sperm mucus interaction problem. Artificial insemination
with the husband's sperm and/or counseling on coital techniques
may be helpful in overcoming these problems.
<P>
Immediately before ejaculation, a muscle at the opening to the
bladder constricts so that sperm rushing from the ejaculatory
ducts are forced out through the penis and not back into the bladder.
 Occasionally diabetics or men with neurologic disorders and men
who have undergone prostate surgery may have difficulty constricting
that muscle.  At the time of ejaculation, the semen spurts into
the bladder rather than out the penis.  I will suspect this if
the amount of semen is very low. I can check for this by testing
a urine sample immediately after ejaculation.  If I find sperm
in the urine, I know retrograde ejaculation is the problem.
<P>
Although urine is normally toxic, we can often collect a good
sperm sample for intrauterine insemination by draining the bladder
and instilling a small amount of nutrient media into the bladder.
I will ask the man to empty his bladder immediately after ejaculation
and will often retrieve healthy sperm for insemination.  When
coupled with<a href="sproviui.html"> ovulation
induction medication, intrauterine insemination</a> can
often be successful. If this fails, a specimen can be retrieved
as mentioned above and used for in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic
sperm injection. But more about that in <a href="ch21mb.html">Chapter
21</a>.
<P>
The sperm's journey from your vagina to the egg through your fallopian
tube is fraught with peril. Only a hundred or so will survive
to encounter this precious genetic package, provided your egg
can pass into and through your fallopian tube. Unfortunately tubal
problems are the most common cause of infertility. In the <a
href="ch16mb.html">next chapter</a> you'll
learn what can cause tubal problems and what you can do to correct
them.
