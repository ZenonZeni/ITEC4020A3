 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> YEAST</H2>
<P>Candida Albicans is the technical name for a yeast that is a normal inhabitant of the human body. It is passed to us from contact with others either at or shortly after birth, and remains with us throughout our lives. It quickly finds its way onto our skin and into our intestinal tracts where it takes up residence with other microorganisms.  Under normal conditions, Candida Albicans live and perform normal vital tasks in harmony with all of their neighbors within our body.</P>
<P>  Over the past forty years the occurrence of elevated levels of yeast have increased dramatically in many people to the point that it has become a problem for hundreds of thousands of individuals. Part of the reason is the more extensive use of  some of the modern immune system depressing drugs such as the steroids like hydrocortisone and antibiotics. They help create an environment that is ideal for overgrowth of Candida yeast. When the Candida balance is shifted slightly, the result can be a vaginal discharge, anal itching, or an oral yeast infection usually called thrush, which deposits an aggravating white coating on the tongue. In the severely debilitated person, the yeast can grow very rapidly, creating a number  of problems ranging from headaches, joint pain, night sweats, fatigue and allergies to severe mental and physical disorders. Quite often people have a general overall feeling of malaise.   They don't feel good and have difficulty concentrating.  Many people with this problem seem to walk around in a daze.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM</H2>
<P>  A comprehensive nutritional support program is important in interrupting the self perpetuating cycle of yeast overgrowth.  The use of a carefully selected nutritional program along with dietary measures can help restore the normal balance necessary to keep these microorganisms in check. The basics of such a diet are to severely limit the simple carbohydrates (sugars) in your diet,  avoid  fungus  or yeast containing foods  like mushrooms, wines, etc., concentrate on foods that are known to be good for the immune system and supplement with specific products that fight the yeast naturally and help restore healthy ecology of the digestive tract.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY PAK is the only program of its kind that supplies the many special amino acids such as L-Cysteine and L-Tyrosine, along with others known for their natural detoxifying and immune supportive effects. They also help maintain consistent blood sugar levels that is so important in yeast management.  Also included in ECOLOGY NO. 1 are the synergistic herbs, Pau d' Arco, Clove and Horse-radish. These special herbs are known for their nutritional effect of naturally supporting the healthy ecology of the intestinal tract. Restoring normal colon ecology plays a key role in maintaining a healthy immune system. The normal healthy colon contains a considerable amount  of fatty  acids  as  byproducts  of the bacterial breakdown of dietary fiber and other organicmaterial. These fatty acids play a key role in maintaining the proper balance between yeast, healthy bacteria and other microorganisms that inhabit our digestive tracts naturally.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 1 supplies many of the nutrients necessary for support of the immune system while at the same  time  helping  the  body  deal  with  the toxicity created by an imbalance of yeast organisms. Along with generous amounts of Vitamin A in the form of Beta-Carotene and Vitamin C as Calcium Ascorbate, ECOLOGY NO. 1 supplies concentrated tissue nutrients from Thymus, Lymph and Spleen, all of which provide nutritional support for the immune system. Also included is Zinc, which is also well known as a natural immune stimulant.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 2 provides a generous amount of these short-chain fatty acids as Caprylic Acid and Undecylenic Acid. These fatty acids are carefully manufactured in a special tablet form to ensure a constant slow release along the intestinal tract.  They work in combination to help restore and preserve the body's normal ecological balance between yeast and bacteria.</P>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 3 is a concentrated form of a synergistic combination of different bio-cultures from Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, Lactobacillus  Bifidus  and  Lactobacillus  Salivarius. Normally these microorganisms help maintain proper pH in the colon and provide a number of other health supporting benefits.   They are normally present in low levels when yeast overgrowth is present. Supplementing with ECOLOGY NO. 3 is the ideal way to help re-establish them in the colon.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  Both ECOLOGY NO. 1 and ECOLOGY NO. 2 are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added  benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE ECOLOGY PAK </H2>
<P>Take two ECOLOGY NO. 1 tablets three times a day with meals.  Take one ECOLOGY NO. 2 tablet plus one-half teaspoonful of ECOLOGY NO. 3 and one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE twice a day between meals. Take one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE twice a day between meals. For best results it is important to avoid refined carbohydrate-s (sugars) in the diet as well as known fungus and yeast containing foods such as mushrooms, wines and yeast breads. Eat foods known to be of value for the immune system. Eat lots of vegetables and plenty of fiber. </P>
<BR><BR><BR>
<P>  ECOLOGY NO. 1 tablets are a broad spectrum supplement that provide many nutrients that support
