COMMON EUROPEAN CREW LICENSE SYSTEM APPROVED BY MINISTERS
French Win Flight Attendant Objection

(Luxembourg)
European Economic Community transport ministers have agreed to a system of
common licensing for member nation air transport crews, beginning Jan. 1
when the states will accept as valid cockpit crew licenses obtained in
other EC countries. Rejected, however, was a similar proposal for cabin
crew members. European Commission was empowered to develop regulations
leading to pan- European license, and expected to complete development of
these common rules by the end of 1992. The French, who have stricter
standards for flight attendants than other EEC nations, objected to
including cabin crews in the initial phase of the changeover to a common
European license.
   In another major development, the ministers agreed to incorporate Joint
Airworthiness Requirements (JARs) into European Community law, making their
application mandatory throughout the EEC. Decision came only after heated
debate between the Commission and ministers from member states over
procedures to be used before the technical rules could be adopted into EEC
law.
   The Commission, composed of independent civil servants, sought sole
authorisation to transcribe the JARs into Community law after simple
consultation with a committee of experts. The transport ministers wanted
the last word on the adoption of all standards, and they rejected the
Commission view that the debates would be extended by presenting every JAR
to ministers who would have the interests of their own countries in mind.
   Final agreement calls for a regulatory committee of experts from member
states to assist the Commission. The committee must first adopt each new
measure before it can be incorporated into EEC law.
   Also at the meeting, the ministers took up the thorny issue of waivers
to noise rules after Greece complained the phaseout of some Chapter 2
aircraft as early as 1995 would be too expensive for Olympic Airways.
Olympic is looking for a temporary exemption for its Boeing 737-200s.
   A similar exemption is being considered for Third World country
airlines. The Commission staff is developing a list of these airlines and
their aircraft, with the issue to be raised again at the Dec. 16-17
transport ministers' meeting.
   The ministers failed to adopt a proposal that would have extended the
Community's transport regulations to Sweden and Norway, a decision that is
unlikely to mean any radical change for SAS. That airline, because of the
involvement in its structure of Denmark, a Community member, already was
following Community rules.
   Agreement, which was to formalise the arrangement for SAS, was rejected
on procedural grounds, and will be raised again at a forthcoming meeting of
the ministers.
   SAS is supporting extension of EEC rules to Sweden and Norway, seeing
this action as a means to obtain further marketing opportunities in the
face of stiffening competition from Community airlines.

AIRLINE EXECUTIVES ATTACK COMPETITION POLICY,URGE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON ATC

   European airline chief executives, describing the European Commission's
stand on competition between Community carriers as "ideological," have
attacked it claiming attempts to create more competition were misguided and
damaging to the industry.
   Led by Air France's Bernard Attali, the heads of five members of the
Association of European Airlines (AEA) told Competition Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan, and Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert, in a "frank
exchange" that their attempts to create more competition ignored the
economics of the airline business.
   European airlines are worried the Commissions competition watchdogs are
subjecting routes where only two carriers operate to increased scrutiny.
The presumption appears to be that only two carriers operating on a route
is suspicious and the situation should be looked at.
   Joining Attali were the chief executives of Alitalia, Lufthansa, KLM and
Swissair, who also called for urgentaction to reform Europe's inefficient
and often cash-starved air traffic control system, run by individual
countries. Air traffic problems are a major source of airline delays.
   Disagreement with the Commission on the competition issue comes as the
EC is asking for an increase in its powers to oversee airline competition.
EC has asked member governments for approval to examine competition on
routes within countries in the 12-nation Community and routes between
Community and third countries.
   Major airlines are worried by a commission proposal on slot allocation,
designed at encouraging new entrants at congested European airports, apart
from Amsterdam's Schiphol, by taking slots from large operators and
redistributing them.
   Brittan and Van Miert "do not seem to understand that some routes cannot
support more than two operators. If you added a third, all three would be
running at a loss," said an AEA spokeswoman.
   Attali told Commissioners their polices were injecting uncertainty into
the airline industry when companies needed to plan years ahead on airline
orders and strategy.
   Commission plans also were attacked as shortsighted since they only take
into account competition between airlines and ignore the fact airlines
compete with cars and Europe's fast developing high-speed train network.
   On the air traffic control problem, the executives, according to the AEA
spokeswoman, said "We are creating a Europe without borders on the ground
but they still exist in the air."
   Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert last month called for
Eurocontrol's powers to be boosted as a means of creating a unified
European air traffic control unit.

AIR FRANCE SUMMONED BY GOVERNMENT TO EXPLAIN PENDING JOB CUTS
Cresson and Attali in Private Talks

   Air France's plan to cut its workforce by 3,000 by the end of 1993 has
come under government scrutiny, with the carrier's president, Bernard
Attali, being summoned to see Prime Minister Edith Cresson to explain the
actions of the state-controlled company.
   The Cresson government is angered that a series of state-run companies,
including Air France and auto maker Renault, have announced plans to cut
their work forces when French unemployment is above the average of its
European Community neighbors and shows no sign of falling. Cresson told the
French Parliament that state-run companies should only announce layoffs
after consultations with the unions, the government and the Employment
Ministry.
   Air France has refused to comment on the meeting or on whether its plans
to save 1.5 billion French francs a year would change. Most of the
employment cutbacks are expected to come through attrition and voluntary
early retirement.
   Cresson is reported to have shocked executives of state-run companies by
suggesting they cut their pay in proportion to the cuts in staff. Head of
Aerospatiale is said to have asked for a raise because he is taking on more
workers.

SABENA TAKES A BACKSEAT AS BELGIAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE

   Future of Belgian airline Sabena has taken a backseat as the government
wavered and finally resigned Friday. Spokeswoman for the Ministry of
Transport said the Sabena file has been delayed by the coalition squabble
about arms shipments and telecommunications contracts.
   Air France is now recognized as the front runner to take a stake in and
conclude a wide partnership agreement with Sabena. A spokeswoman for the
airline said the Air France talks had progressed further than those with
British Airways. BA is said to have balked when asked to put in more money
for a bigger share of Sabena.

TRANS-EUROPEAN SELLS TOUR SUBSIDIARY

Trans-European Airlines, Belgium's second largest carrier, has received a
much-needed cash infusion by selling its tour subsidiary, Sunsnacks, for a
reported 670 million Belgian francs.
   TEA, which is operating under the Belgian equivalent of Chapter 11
bankruptcy, is in desperate need of cash to meet its debts. Sale of
Sunsnacks to Neckermann, the Belgian tour subsidiary of Europe's fourth
largest tour operator, Frankfurt-based NUR Touristic, came as TEA's U.K.
subsidiary ceased operations.
   Charter carrier TEA U.K. ceased operations when Manchester Airport
officials impounded one of its five Boeing 737s for non-payment of landing
fees. TEA U.K. operated from Manchester, London Gatwick and East Midlands
airports.
   French charter subsidiary, TEA-France, continues to operate and search
for a new shareholder in spite of its announcement to a Nanterre commercial
court that it has stopped making debt payments. Neckermann said TEA
Belgium would continue providing charter service for Sunsnacks.

IBERIA DELIVERIES PUSHED BACK TWO YEARS

   Iberia, facing a $450 million loss this year, has renegotiated the
delivery schedule for new aircraft purchased from the big three
manufacturers, postponing deliveries of new Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas and
Airbus aircraft by two years.
   Spanish carrier said post-Persian Gulf War market trends forced it to
reconsider its original schedule.
   The carrier originally placed orders for 24 McDonnell Douglas MD-87s, 22
Airbus A320s, six A340s, and 16 Boeing 757s, with the total value of the
package coming to $4 billion. All the MD-87s and 12 A320s have been
delivered. Delivery of another A320 was postponed from 1991 to 1993.
   Delivery of the eight A340s, scheduled for 1994, will be spread over two
years into 1995. New schedule for the Boeing aircraft, programmed for 1993
and 1994, calls for three to be delivered in 1993, five in 1994, three in
1995 and five in 1996.

DAN-AIR ASKS SHAREHOLDERS FOR FINANCIAL INFUSION, SEES RECOVERY AHEAD

   Davies and Newman, parent company of British airline Dan-Air, has begun
selling a new issue of shares valued at 49.3 million pounds sterling to
raise cash needed to continue its fleet modernisation. Issue, backed by 19
London financial institutions, was described by the firm's chairman as the
start of the airline's recovery.
   The carrier already is the leading airline operating from London Gatwick
Airport, with 17.7% of total traffic, a position strengthened by the
collapse of Air Europe.
   At the same time that Davies and Newman disclosed the stock issue, the
company also revealed it had incurred a pre-tax loss of 40.4 million pounds
sterling for the first half of 1991. Loss for the full year should amount
to 35 million pounds sterling, compared with 38.8 million pounds sterling
in 1990.
   Turnover for the first half of 1991 amounted to 139.2 million pounds
sterling, down 19% from last year's 171.2 million pounds sterling.
   David James, chairman of Davies and Newman, said the share issue will be
used to purchase 20 737 aircraft over the next four years, and to
inaugurate 11 new routes. Carrier will not increase the size of its 38-
airplane fleet, but will replace older 727s and BAC-111s with newer 300-
and 400-series 737s.
   Earlier this year, Dan-Air applied to the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority
for 11 route licenses to complete its European network. Routes from London
Gatwick to Oslo, Stockholm, Rome, Athens, Istanbul, Cairo and Barcelona
should be started by the end of the year or early next year. Dusseldorf,
Malta, Palma de Majorca and Copenhagen will be added later.
   Dan-Air had been considering flights from Berlin to Moscow and other
Eastern European cities, but decided not to proceed with the project.

ALITALIA POSTS FIRST-HALF LOSS, EXPECTS NEAR BREAKEVEN SECOND HALF

   Alitalia reported a 104.2 billion lira loss for the first six months of
1991, the airline announced, compared with a 75 billion loss for the same
period last year. One dollar equals about 1,259.90 lira at recent exchange
rates. The airline carried out sale and lease-back transactions of aircraft
that produced 155.3 billion lira. Alitalia said it was particularly
penalized by the Gulf War because of its geographical position and emphasis
on service to the Middle East. Despite a 39% falloff of international
traffic in February, the carrier said it bounced back better than other
European airlines, with traffic share increases of 2% to Germany, 5% to
Spain, 4% on long-haul routes and 8% to the U.S.
   For the period, total revenue shrank 16.5% from 2.103 billion lira in
the first half of 1990 to 2.086 billion lira this year. With a set-aside
of 156.8 billion lira, the carrier had an operating loss of 90.6 billion
lira. The airline said it expects to reach near breakeven revenues in the
second half of the year despite the uncertain economic outlook.

SAS SHUTS DOWN NORDIC, TRANSATLANTIC ROUTES

   SAS is ceasing operations on three intercontinental route and one
between Sweden and Finland, saying the decision was temporary but related
to poor profitability on all four routes. Copenhagen to Sao Paolo, Chicago
and Toronto will be closed down, as will Stockholm-Tammersfors, Finland's
second largest city.
   Airline, which is negotiating sharp salary cuts with its pilots, said it
does not exclude abandoning more routes. The wage cuts, it said, are
indispensable if SAS is to remain one of five surviving intercontinental
airlines in Europe by 1995, SAS said.
   The carrier will relinquish traffic rights between Copenhagen and
Toronto in the summer of 1992 to its partner, Austrian Airlines, which will
fly to Toronto from Vienna via Copenhagen. Danish charter company Sterling
Airways is interested in the route.
   Sao Paolo route could go to SAS's other partner, Swissair, although no
decision has been made.
  SAS will cease operations between Copenhagen and Tammersfors, 200 miles
north of Helsinki, Oct. 27.
   Scandinavian carrier also has decided to close its Copenhagen-Belgrade
route, which it had flown five times weekly. SAS cited security and low
load factors as reasons.

AUSTRIAN AIRLINES BUYS AIRBUS FOR VIENNA-LOS ANGELES ROUTE

   Austrian Airlines has ordered two A340-300s, and taken an option for two
more, to be used on African and Asian routes, and a new Vienna-Los Angeles
route. Aircraft, to be delivered in December 1993 or January 1994, would be
operated Vienna-Johannesburg, Vienna-Tokyo, and the carriers's new
Vienna-Los Angeles route, which it intends to inaugurate at that time.
   Austrian flies to Johannesburg via Nairobi once a week, but intends to
double that frequency by the end of this month. It will open a new route
to Nairobi Oct. 9, and hopes to obtain the necessary authorisation to link
up with Johannesburg within the following weeks.
   In keeping with its decision to focus on East European routes, Austrian
also is doubling the frequency of its flights to Kiev. Beginning this
month, it will fly four times a week to the Ukrainian capital, and
negotiations are under way for the launch of a route to one of the Baltic
states by the end of March 1992.

NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT IN TALKS TO OPEN UP NORTHERN MARKET

   The Norwegian government is in the middle of negotiations that could
result in 200,000 extra passengers a year for Scandinavian carrier SAS.
Negotiations are taking place between the Ministry of Defense and the
Ministry of Communications over whether the military should end its well-
developed services in northern Norway in favor of civilian companies.
Military services have arranged a program to give soldiers and their
families the six free flights a year home they are given as a right. SAS
has been lobbying hard for the last 20 years for such a move and for the
first time, it appears the military may give way. Such a move would double
SAS's northern Norway market overnight and give the carrier a chance of
breaking even after losing 90 million Norwegian kroner on services last
year. One dollar equals about 6.59 Norwegian kroner at recent exchange
rates. SAS has warned that it might have to end loss-making services in
northern Norway as it streamlines to prepare for the 1993 liberalization of
the European airline market. The carrier says it could easily cope with
the new demand because existing flights are underused.

IATA PROTESTS FINNISH TRAVEL TAX PROPOSAL

   International Air Transport Association yesterday labeled a proposed
Finnish travel tax a "rip-off" and charged that the tax is designed only to
generate revenue for the government and would not provide any benefits for
airlines or travelers. According to IATA, the tax would apply to all
travelers leaving the country using tickets purchased locally. Scheduled
airline passengers would pay roughly $37 per departure and charter
passengers would pay $49 if the tax proposal is adopted by the Finnish
Parliament and the country's president.
   "This proposed tax on travel is just a rip-off," charged IATA Director
General Guenter Eser. "It does nothing for the passenger and the Finnish
government has the nerve to expect the airlines and agents to collect the
money," he said. "This taxation is going on all over the world and, sooner
or later, the consumers are going to decide that they have had enough."

FINNAIR BEGINS TALKS WITH LUFTHANSA AS IT LEAVES QUALITY ALLIANCE

   Finnair and Germany's Lufthansa announced the start of partnership
negotiations after Finnair withdrew from the European Quality Alliance
(EQA) partnership with SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
   A Finnair spokesman said talks with Lufthansa could center on reviving
joint flight agreements that ended in the 1980s. He pointed out that both
Finnair and Lufthansa were actively extending their networks to the Baltic
states and Eastern Europe.
   Negotiations, which start immediately, will aim to have some agreements
in place for the start of summer 1992's timetable.
   A deal between Finnair and Lufthansa would appear to make commercial
sense. Finnair flies to five destinations in Germany, more than to any
other country. Lufthansa recently stepped up flights to Finland and
announced new services to Latvia starting November.
   Lufthansa for its part said the companies would increase cooperation in
both the freight and passenger sectors. Links might extend to catering and
technology, it added. The Finnair withdrawal from the EQA was a bid for
independence as the other companies decided to enter into even closer
cooperation.
   The closer cooperation, agreed in Vienna on September 30, will focus on
marketing and sales,a joint traffic system and product cooperation. It will
stop short of mergers between the three remaining EQA airlines.
   The cooperation will cut costs and increase the companies' market share,
the partners said. Finnair will negotiate bilaterally with the EQA partners
about existing agreements. The hourly shuttle service between Helsinki and
Stockholm will continue. The EQA partnership was already close before the
Vienna decision. Partners share office space, handle each other's airport
services and exchange cockpit crews. Scandinavian Airlines System took
partnership with Finnair one step further when its tour operator,
Vingresor, took a 50% stake in Finnair's tour company Toivelomat and
Finnair acquired a minority stake in SAS International Hotels.

PARIS AIRPORTS PROFITS DOWN 45 PERCENT

   Net profits of the state-owned company, Aeroports de Paris, which
operates Paris' airports, dropped 45.5% in the first half of 1991, to 90.4
million French francs from 165.6 million French francs earned in the first
half of 1990. Turnover declined slightly, reaching 2.462 billion French
francs, compared with 2.511 billion the previous period.
   Traffic also declined, showing a 9.9% decrease between January and June
1991 compared with last year. Most pronounced drop, 11%, was in
international traffic, while domestic traffic was off 7.4%. Company
attributed the decline to the effects of the Persian Gulf War on North
African and Middle Eastern routes out of Paris.
   Turnaround appears to have started. Traffic in July grew slightly and
remained stable in August. The trend, if it persists, would offset much of
the first six months' decline in passenger count and bring profits for the
year to 350 million French francs.

BRUSSELS INSTITUTES PENALTIES FOR CHAPTER 2 AND NIGHT OPERATIONS

   Brussels Airport has approved penalties for operating Chapter 2 aircraft
but has stayed their implementation temporarily because noise equipment is
not in place. Airport will instead issue warnings to airlines flying the
aircraft, threatening an eventual ban on their operations.
   Meanwhile, the airport approved higher landing fees for night
operations, an attempt to encourage more daytime scheduling of flights.
Collection of the night-time fees was implemented Oct. 1.
   New rules provide economic incentives to use quieter aircraft. Belgium
Ministry of Transport said a 30-tonne aircraft rated as Chapter 3 would pay
a nighttime landing fee of 4,800 Belgian francs, compared with 5,400
Belgian francs previously.
   A similar aircraft rated Chapter 3, however, would see landing fees for
night operations climb, from approximately 7,860 Belgian francs to 9,240
Belgian francs.

NEW REGIONAL AIRPORT OPENED IN FRANCE

   A new airport designed to group the activities of two neighbouring
French regional airports at Metz and Nancy, will begin operations this
month in the northeast of France.
   The international Metz-Nancy-Lorraine airport will open Oct. 28, with a
2.5 km runway and a terminal with capacity of 200,000 passengers a year. It
will not be suitable for large aircraft, or for freight traffic.
   All of TAT's flights to Metz and Nancy will converge on the new
facility. The French carrier operates internal routes to Paris, Lille,
Marseille, Nice, Nantes, Bordeaux and Lyon.
   Airport's international label results from its use by Luxemburg airline,
Luxair, which will operate a 29-seat Embraer Brasilia to London Stansted
via Metz-Nancy-Lorraine six times a week.

OAA CARRIERS AGREE ON YIELD PRESERVATION

Orient Airlines Association's 14 member carriers have informally agreed
that projected increases in traffic and capacity in the Asia/Pacific region
not be achieved at the expense of lower yields and higher breakeven load
factors. Organization, at its 35th Assembly of Presidents in Hong Kong,
issued a statement saying that "further yield deterioration will severely
impact on the viability of airline operations."
   OAA expects passenger traffic to increase 9.5% and freight traffic to
grow 11.5% annually over the next four to five years. Capacity in the
region is expected to increase 10-12% annually. OAA member carriers posted
a combined operating profit of just over $2 billion for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1991, down 22.1% from a year earlier, when the OAA airlines
had a systemwide operating profit of $2.6 billion. Operating revenues
increased 8.5% in fiscal 1990/91 to $30.8 billion, but operating expenses
were up $28.8 billion.
   Airlines carried a combined 129.6 million passengers, up from 120.6
million a year earlier. Passenger traffic increased 5.2% to 271.3 billion
revenue passenger kilometers and capacity 5.6% to 374.3 billion available
seat kilometers.
