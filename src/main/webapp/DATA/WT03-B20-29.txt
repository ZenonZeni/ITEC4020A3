<title>Wind Plants of Yorkshire, England</title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants of Yorkshire, England</h1></b></head><p>

<body>

Though Britain has the best wind resources in Europe, wind development 

only began in earnest in the early 1990s when dairyman Peter Edwards 

installed ten wind turbines on his farm in Cornwall. Subsequently, most 

development in the United Kingdom has been concentrated in England, 

Wales, and Cornwall. <p>



There is currently 170 MW of installed capacity, but the third tranche 

of Britain's Non Fossil Fuel Obligation has awarded contracts for 300 

MW of new wind power plants in England and Wales. Another 100 MW of 

contracts were awarded in Scotland.<p>

<h3>Car Park at Royd Moor</h3></center><p>



Tourists enjoying a beautiful summer evening on Royd Moor. The car 

park (parking lot) provides a comfortable place for viewing the 13 

Bonus 450 kW wind turbines on the site in the southern Pennine chain. 

The hill top site offers spectacular views of southern Yorkshire. The 

37-meter turbines stand in two rows on the paddock. <p>



Wind development in Britain is following a far different pattern from 

that in California or elsewhere in Europe. Unlike northern Europe, where most of the wind turbines are being installed singly or in small clusters, wind turbines have been installed in 

England and Wales in small wind power plants of 10 to 100 turbines. These wind plants are far smaller than those in California where it's not uncommon to install 300 turbines at one time.<p>



British wind plants are models of uncluttered, aesthetically pleasing 

development. Many, such as this one on Royd Moor, include car parks 

for visitors, and provide access for ramblers (hikers). <p>
