<P>Responding to the current phthalate controversy</P>

<P>The recent incident concerning levels of phthalate in baby milk formulae has once again illustrated how the media can distort a story to create a major food scare.  Many food manufacturers and retailers have been monitoring the levels of phthalates in their products for some time and have taken steps to reduce levels either from packaging materials or environmental sources.  The potential damage to brands from this type of media attention can do untold harm to responsible manufacturers who endeavour to produce safe and high quality products.</P>

<P>RSSL first reported on phthalate contamination through our company newsletter Contract in 1994 and have for some years developed GC-MS methodology to analyse for the whole range of phthalates in foods and food contact materials.  The methods are not straightforward because of the need to eliminate accidental contamination from phthalates already present in the laboratory environment.  These methods have enabled levels of potentially toxic phthalates such as di-n-butyl phthalate and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate to be monitored at mg/kg levels.  </P>

<P>By providing these services on a routine basis, RSSL has assisted companies to monitor levels of phthalates in their products as part of  &#39;due diligence&#39; screening programmes.  We also offer companies an Emergency Response Service for the immediate analysis of products.  This service is available 24 hours a day,  365 days of the year and provides emergency cover in situations where companies need all the analytical facts before they can determine their most appropriate response.</P>

<P>Data on the toxicity of phthalic acid esters have been collected over many years with references dating back to the 1930&#39;s.  RSSL has compiled an extensive information file on phthalates covering toxicity information and surveillance reports.  If you would like some of this data for your own records, please contact Di Amor on 0118 986 8541.</P>

<P>To give a brief history of the situation, the majority of the work has been carried out on rodents  which showed that high doses of certain phthalate esters can lower blood lipids and have adverse effects on the testes and embryonic survival.  In their Food Surveillance Paper in 1987 (No. 21) MAFF reported that there was around a 100,000-fold margin between the no-effect levels for reproductive toxicity and the maximum likely human intakes. Nevertheless an update on food contact materials in Food Surveillance Paper No 30 (1990) showed that certain foodstuffs (potato snacks and chocolates) contained up to 18.6 mg/kg of dicyclohexyl phthalate and it was recommended that steps be taken to reduce the chance of  any contamination.</P>  

<P>During 1994, MAFF further acknowledged the widespread occurrence of very low levels of phthalates in the environment, including food packaging materials, and stated that it intended to include routine phthalate determinations in its Total Diet Study from early in 1995.  It also continues to look at the migration of phthalates and other printing ink components as part of its surveillance of paper and board food contact materials.</P>

<P>The debate on the dangers of so-called &#34;environmental oestrogens&#34; was re-opened in 1994 by American scientists who claimed that a cocktail of pollutants from food and water were damaging the reproductive functions of the Western male.  Although the original articles focussed on DDT and PCBs, which are chemically distinct from phthalates, concern about the reproductive toxicity of phthalates has resurfaced in the UK media and teams of biologists at Brunel and Edinburgh Universities are currently looking at the hazards posed by longer term, cumulative effects of  phthalates and other plastic components.</P>

<P>The recent controversy over infant formulae has arisen from a MAFF survey which indicated that dietary intakes of phthalates by formula-fed infants expressed on a body weight basis would be proportionally higher than intakes by adults on a mixed diet.  MAFF have recommended that sources of phthalates in the formulae should be established and steps taken to reduce levels found where possible.</P>

<P>To reassure customers, retailers can encourage their suppliers to test products for phthalate levels. In this way companies can determine whether they have a widespread problem in their own products and if they do, to test samples at various stages of the production process to establish the sources of contamination. </P>
