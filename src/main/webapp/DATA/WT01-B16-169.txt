<TITLE>High Blood Pressure</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P>A normal blood pressure is under 140/90. High blood pressure
is diagnosed if the reading is above this level on more than one occasion.
<P>We treat high blood pressure to prevent the development of its complications.
These are strokes, heart attacks, heart and kidney failure. It usually requires
continuoud lifelong therapy. A patient with high blood pressure can not tell
it it is high by the way he or she feels. Most patients with high blood pressure
are completely asymptomatic.
<P>The treatment of high blood pressure is very effective in preventing its
complications. If you have not had your blood pressure checked lately, come
to our office and ask to see Jesse for a free BP reading.
