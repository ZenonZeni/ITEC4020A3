<H1>Financial Outlook</H1>
<UL>
<LI> Inflation was only 0.3% for the 12-month period ending in February. The
construction index indicates a price decline of 0.3%, while the WPI rose 4%. The
government predicts 1.5% inflation for 1996. Price stability should continue,
despite rising food prices.
</LI>
<LI> Interest rates are going down more slowly than the government would like.
The VAT on bank loans and interest has been reduced in order to spur the
descent.
</LI>
<LI> Exports are expected to show a 12% increase this year, after having soared
32% last year. Sales to principal trading partner Brazil are forecast to rise
15%. Imports will increase more slowly, depending on when the economic upturn
begins. Current predictions are for imports to reach $21.1 billion, resulting in
a trade surplus of $2.2 billion.
</LI>
<LI> Bank deposits &#150; including dollar deposits &#150; grew 9.1% during
January and February to $46.7 billion, surpassing the $43.8 billion registered
at the end of 1994. (The end 1994 figure was calculated after the Mexican crisis
began; it does not reflect the $6.2 billion that left the country during
first-quarter 1995.) Time deposits in pesos jumped 23.5% in first-quarter 1996
and dollar deposits rose 8.7%. Loans grew far more slowly: 11.3% in pesos and
barely 1.7% in dollars. Bank liquidity has surged, as bankers hold potential
borrowers to higher credit standards in an effort to avoid increasing the
sector's bad loan portfolio, which jumped 64.8% during the first eight months of
1995. The excess funds are invested abroad or in bonds. The unwillingness of
banks to lend is reinforcing the recession.
</LI>
<LI> Convertibility is being strictly maintained. Gold and forex reserves
exceed the monetary base by 30.8%. In February, the government reached an
agreement with the IMF for $1.1 billion in standby funds that will be disbursed
quarterly over 21 months.

</UL>
<H1>Economy Monitor:  Argentina</H1>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Growth Outlook:</B> GDP defied all earlier forecasts and shrank 4.4%
during 1995. Economy minister Domingo Cavallo is sticking to his 5% growth
prediction for 1996, but local private forecasts are running as low as 1.5%. The
forecasts vary so widely because the economy still shows few signs of having
climbed out of recession. The one sign of incipient recovery is lower car
inventories.
</LI>
<LI> <B>Political Factors:</B> The economy ministry's second in command, Juan
Llach, has publicly blamed 70% of the recession on the friction between
President Carlos Menem and economy minister Cavallo. Hostilities appear to have
abated. After much discussion, congress has approved the important
administrative reform measures to shrink the size of the federal government by
merging and eliminating various agencies, but it remains to be seen whether new
cabinet chief Jorge Rodriguez will show the same enthusiasm for such reform as
his predecessor, Eduardo Bauza.
</LI>
<LI> <B>Fiscal Situation:</B> Despite the VAT hike from 18% to 21%, the
recession continued to push down tax revenues, which then pushed the fiscal
deficit up to 1.7% of GDP last year. The 1996 deficit could be 1% of GDP unless
the economy begins a strong recovery.
</LI>
<LI> <B>Major Sectors:</B> Agrochemicals grew 27.8% in January and February,
compared to the same period in 1995. Food products grew 5.7%, cigarettes 1.1%
and aluminum production 0.7%. But manufacturing fell 10.5%, according to
economic think tank Fiel (5% according to official statistics agency INDEC), as
consumers stopped buying for fear of losing their jobs. Six industries declined
more than the Fiel average: auto manufacturing (40%), petrochemicals (29.1%),
cement (26.6%), freezers and washing machines (25.7%), tractors (22.3%) and
tires (20.3%).
</LI>
<LI> Despite a drought that lowered crop yields 6%, farmers' income will
increase 37% this year due to large price increases for wheat (81%, also the
sowing area will increase 25%), corn (79.3%), soybeans (28.7%) and sunflowers
(13.1%). But farming comprises only 6% of GDP, so the effect will be minor.
Sales of farm machinery, seeds, fertilizers and agrochemicals are expected to
increase steeply; already, sprinkler sales in January and February matched
annual sales for 1995. Beef exports are improving and revenues may reach $1
billion.
</LI>
<LI> <B>Unemployment: </B>The jobless rate went down to 16.2% in the official
October poll after having shot up to an unprecedented 18.6% in May 1995. But the
reduction was due more to disappointed jobseekers abandoning their search rather
than to the 40,000 new jobs created since the May survey. The government
predicts that unemployment will fall again in the May 1996 survey, but private
analysts are dubious.
</LI>
<LI> <B>Stock Market:</B> Both stocks and bonds dipped in mid-February when
hostilities reignited between President Menem and economy minister Cavallo, but
later recovered as the two made up again. Though the blue-chip index has sunk
2.9% since the beginning of the year, it has registered a 42.9% hike over the
past 12 months, when tequila effect fallout first pushed it down.
</LI>
</UL>
<H1>Company Monitor</H1>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Rhodia-star</B>  is deciding whether to build a second 90,000-ton
plant following <B>Eastman Chemical</B>'s decision to produce 130,000 tons of
PET. Investment would be $70 million. <B>YPF</B> and <B>Shell</B> are
considering a joint venture for a PET plant targeted mainly for exports.
</LI>
<LI> Chile's <B>Embotelladora Polar</B> paid $19.8 million for a <B>Coca Cola</B>
permit in Patagonia, and also bought licenses from four Coca Cola companies in
Bahia Blanca, Chacabuca (Buenos Aires province), Neuquen and La Pampa. Total
cost was approximately $55 million.
</LI>
<LI> Spain's <B>Iberia</B> sold 60% of its equity in <B>Aerolineas Argentinas</B>
to <B>Merrill Lynch</B> and <B>Bankers Trust</B> as well as its entire stake
in Argentine regional airline <B>Austral</B> and in Chile's <B>Ladeco,</B>
though the Spanish company will continue operating all three airlines. The sale
price for all three companies was estimated at $280 million. The two new owners
plan to seek potential buyers.
</LI>
<LI> <B>Nabisco</B>  affiliate <B>Terrabusi</B> bought baked-goods company
<B>Mayco Capri</B> for $35 million. Mayco's annual sales are $30 million.
