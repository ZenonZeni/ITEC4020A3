<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Logging and mining concessions; road construction;  insufficient protected areas, systems, and policies; limited economic opportunities. </I> 



<P>With
nearly 90 percent -- or 15 million hectares -- of its original
forest cover intact, Suriname harbors rich biodiversity, including
674 species of birds, 200 species of mammals, 130 reptiles, 99
amphibians, and roughly 5,000 plants.   

<P>
CI Suriname is committed
to protecting this country's remarkable stretches of pristine
rain forest, while identifying initiatives that will yield income
for its inhabitants.  By presenting options like bioprospecting
and ecotourism, CI is helping policymakers realize that they have
economic alternatives to wholesale environmental destruction.
 As a first step, CI prepared an in-depth economic analysis of
the logging companies' proposals, &quot;Backs to the Wall in Suriname.&quot;
 From this report, government and private forest experts have
concluded that Suriname would actually see only a small fraction
of anticipated revenue.  CI also sponsored a visit to Costa Rica
for the first group of Suriname Paliament members to gather information
on development options -- notably ecotourism and bioprospecting
-- that offer two potentially profitable alternatives to logging.

The Suriname program is now helping design environmentally sustainable
national policies through the development of the CI-Suriname Policy
Group.  This nonpartisan group is currently exploring how to implement
Earth Summit's Agenda 21 and Biodiversity Conventions, including
how to make sure that intellectual and genetic property rights
benefit local people.  Policy decisions on these questions will
have long-term impact on Suriname's economic development and ecosystems.
CI is also active in the villages, forging conservation-based
economic development programs to benefit local communities. 

<P>
<H4> <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/shaman.htm">Bioprospecting</A></H4>

<P>
Recognizing the possibilities for economic return
from native plant products,  CI is guiding a major bioprospecting
initiative that has already begun to produce some income for Suriname.
 Partners to the bioprospecting agreement include CI, the U.S.
National Institutes of Health (NIH), pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Surinamese government agencies, NGOs, and the indigenous
Saramakaner tribe.  Launched in 1994, the project has been collecting
flowering plants from rain forests in southern Suriname and screening
them for biological activity against HIV and cancer.   

<P>
By the
end of 1995, 650 specimens had been collected. Of these, 61 show
promising chemical activity, and 20 have been selected for further
pharmaceutical testing.  Royalties from even one new plant-derived
medication could dwarf logging revenues--and leave the trees standing.

<P>
<STRONG>The Forest Peoples Fund</STRONG> was established by CI to channel funds
from the bioprospecting agreement into conservation initiatives
in indigenous communities in southern Suriname.  This year, the
Forest Peoples Fund helped organize a community center in Asindopo
village to house ecotourists, promote arts and crafts development,
and provide equipment and training to traditional woodcarvers.
 The Fund also financed a delegation of Amerindian and Maroon
village chiefs to visit EMBRAPA, a Brazilian community organization
working on agroforestry and alternative forest products, to exchange
ideas on conservation-based development. 

<P>
<H4>The Shaman's Apprentice
Program</H4>  

<P>
The healers, or shamans, of the tropical forests hold
a world of knowledge about medicinal plants--most of the them
yet unknown to Western science.  To help preserve this knowledge,
foster pride in indigenous traditions, and create an incentive
to protect the forests, CI began the Shaman's Apprentice Program
in 1992 in the Amerindian village of Kwamalasamoetoe.  This program
supports young Tirio men and women in learning about the uses
of rain forest plants from shamans, thus ensuring the knowledge
will be passed on.  Following a visit to the CI project, the neighboring
Wayana people invited CI to start up a similar project in their
village of Tepu, which got underway in 1995.
