<h1 align=center>DONOR INSEMINATION</h1><hr>
<h2>AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE</h2>
Approximately 10% of couples in the United States are involuntarily infertile. Of these, approximately 50% are due to cases of low male fertility. Artificial insemination, utilizing donor semen, has become an acceptable alternative to many of these patients.  It is estimated that in 1983 over 20,000 births in the United States were the result of donor insemination.<p>
Artificial insemination utilizing an anonymous donor, may be necessary for a number of reasons. The absence of sperm in the husband is, by far, the most common.  In other cases, husbands may have a low sperm count or immotile sperm which are incapable of fertilizing an egg.  Other men are unable to ejaculate because of  neurologic disorders.  Donor insemination may also be indicated when the husband is a carrier or a victim of a serious inherited disease.<p>
Although adoption can be an attractive alternative as well, there has been a growing scarcity of adoptable babies and prospective parents may have to wait a long time before adoption becomes possible.  Artificial  insemination, in selected cases, may have certain advantages.  The child conceived by artificial insemination is biologically closer to the parents both physically and, in some cases, emotionally.  The wife has an opportunity to experience pregnancy, birth, nursing, and all the other roles of motherhood she wishes.<p>
Arrangements will be made for your physician to obtain frozen specimens from a local "sperm bank."  The bank is directed by a physician assisted by staff with a special interest in male infertility and who maintain the highest standards possible.  The physician is a member of the American Fertility Society and observes their guidelines for donor insemination.  Donors are carefully selected by obtaining the donors' background in depth, taking a careful history to rule out hereditary diseases, chronic infections, or any venereal diseases.  The majority of the donors are knowledgeable graduate students who, in most cases, have demonstrated previous fertility.  Donors may be chosen to represent the race, blood type, and physical characteristics of the husband, including eye and hair color as well as complexion and height.  All donors are screened for AIDS and hepatitis, and their specimens are cultured for venereal disease.  <p>
The arrangement with donors are kept in strict secrecy and it is impossible to connect a donor with a recipient since these records are never established.<p>
At the beginning of the insemination process, both the husband and wife are asked to sign a consent form.  The husband consents to the artificial insemination of his wife and agrees that if the wife should bear any child as a result of the artificial insemination process that the child will be treated by law as if it were the husband's natural child.  Naturally, the outcome of any pregnancy would be subject to the same risks and possible complications affecting pregnancies in the general population.<p>
Artificial insemination has become an acceptable and recognized practice throughout the world.  The moral, philosophical, and religious aspects must be considered by each couple on an individual basis.  Therefore, we ask you to visit with a counselor prior to initiating  therapy.<p>
If further information is needed to help you with the decision, please feel free to  ask your physician.<p><hr>
