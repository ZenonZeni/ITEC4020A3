<H3>CDT Letter to Senate Commerce Committee Members regarding Pro-CODE Committee
Vote</H3>
<BR>
<PRE>September 9, 1996

Dear Senate Commerce Committee Member:

Outdated government regulations on encryption products continue to
jeopardize the privacy and security of our computer networks.  Later
this week, the Senate Commerce Committee will have an opportunity
to address this problem when it acts on S.1726, the Promotion of 
Commerce On-line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996 co-
sponsored by Senators Burns, Leahy, Pressler, Lott, Wyden, Ashcroft, 
and others.

<STRONG>The Center for Democracy and Technology strongly urges you
to report S.1726 out of the Senate Commerce Committee without
amendment.</STRONG>

Individuals and businesses need strong encryption products to protect 
their personal communications, confidential records, and proprietary 
information online. Such trust in the security of the network is needed 
if we are to realize the tremendous promise of the Internet to 
invigorate our democracy and promote electronic commerce.  Moreover,
the widespread use of strong encryption actually prevents crime and 
protects our sensitive infrastructure from possible &quot;information warfare.&quot;

Yet Cold War-era regulations on encryption continue to restrict the 
export and use of encryption products. Since strong encryption products 
are readily available abroad, these export controls do little to keep 
encryption out of the hands of terrorists, criminals, or foreign 
governments.  It is only law-abiding U.S. computer users who must 
sacrifice their security under current regulations.  The Administration 
has been unable to justify this loss of privacy for millions of computer 
users to satisfy a law enforcement concern that has already been 
compromised.
 
S.1726 would sensibly ease the export controls on encryption while 
guaranteeing the rights of American computer users to choose the 
security products most appropriate for them.  Congressional action is 
urgently needed given growing concerns about the security of our 
information infrastructure and the Administration's continued 
intransigence on this issue. 

As a public interest group deeply involved in promoting democratic 
values in new electronic media, the Center for Democracy and 
Technology has had a chance to see first-hand the real need for privacy
and security online that only widely available strong encryption products
can provide.  Help send a message that Congress is serious about the 
privacy and security of computer users. Please pass the Pro-CODE bill 
out of the Commerce Committee without amendment.

Sincerely,

Jerry Berman
Executive Director
Center for Democracy and Technology</PRE>
