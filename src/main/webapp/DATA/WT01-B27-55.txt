<p><b>The LaGuardia Report </b></p>

<h1>FOREWORD </h1>

<p><b>by Fiorello LaGuardia</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>As Mayor of the City of New York, it is my duty to foresee and
take steps to prevent the development of hazards to the health,
safety, and welfare of our citizens. When rumors were recently
circulated concerning the smoking of marihuana by large segments
of our population and even by school children, I sought advice
from The New York Academy of Medicine, as is my custom when
confronted with problems of medical import. On the Academy's
recommendation I appointed a special committee to make a thorough
sociological and scientific investigation, and secured funds from
three Foundations with which to finance these studies. </p>

<p>My own interest in marihuana goes back many years, to the time
when I was a member of the House of Representatives and, in that
capacity, heard of the use of marihuana by soldiers stationed in
Panama. I was impressed at that time with the report of an Army
Board of Inquiry which emphasized the relative harmlessness of
the drug and the fact that it played a very little role, if any,
in problems of delinquency and crime in the Canal Zone. </p>

<p>The report of the present investigations covers every phase of
the problem and is of practical value not only to our own city
but to communities throughout the country. It is a basic
contribution to medicine and pharmacology. I am glad that the
sociological, psychological, and medical ills commonly attributed
to marihuana have been found to be exaggerated insofar as the
City of New York is concerned. I hasten to point out, however,
that the findings are to be interpreted only as a reassuring
report of progress and not as encouragement to indulgence, for I
shall continue to enforce the laws prohibiting the use of
marihuana until and if complete findings may justify an amendment
to existing laws. The scientific part of the research will be
continued in the hope that the drug may prove to possess
therapeutic value for the control of drug addiction. </p>

<p>I take this occasion to express my appreciation and gratitude
to the members of my committee, to The New York Academy of
Medicine, and to the Commonwealth Fund, the Friedsam Foundation,
and the New York Foundation which supported these important
investigations so generously.<br>
</p>

<p>F. H. LaGuardia </p>

<p>Mayor<br>
<br>
