<CENTER><B>Ontario Parks - A New Approach To Park Management In Ontario</B></CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced the launch of Ontario Parks, marking the beginning of a new era in the 100-year history of provincial parks in Ontario.<P>

"With the creation of Ontario Parks, the government is charting a bold new course in park management in Ontario," said Mr. Hodgson.  "As an organization within MNR, Ontario Parks will operate like a business.  It will work closely with business partners, and provide our customers with the products and services they want and need.  Most of all, it will ensure that Ontario's provincial parks system remains one of the finest in the world." <P>

Mr. Hodgson made the announcement this morning at the official opening of the new Sandbanks Provincial Park entrance way.<P>

Ontario Parks is the first entrepreneurial program of its kind in the Ontario Government.  It is designed to maintain the goals and objectives of the existing parks system while managing the parks more efficiently.  It will be accountable to the Minister through a newly-appointed board of directors, and will develop a "special purpose account" for retaining and managing park revenues.<P>

"Maintaining our parks system and protecting Ontario's irreplaceable natural heritage is a priority with this government, and a core responsibility for MNR," said Mr. Hodgson.  "The new organization will provide opportunities for the private sector and allow the provincial parks system to continue to prosper in a challenging fiscal environment.<P>

"Ontario Parks will ensure that the parks system continues as a provincial showcase, enhancing tourism and business objectives for Ontario," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>
