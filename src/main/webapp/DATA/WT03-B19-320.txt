<H3>VICTORIAN  FIRST IN MULTIMEDIA INDUSTRY</H3>

<P>
Victoria has embarked on one of tlae major economic developments
of its history - in the burgeoning information Technology and
multimedia industry.
<P>
This sector had potential in the first half of the 21st century
to have a bigger impact on Victoria than the gold rush, the Premier,
Mr. Kennett, said today.
<P>
'The Victorian Government will be the first in Australia to develop
a comprehensive public and private sector plan for infrastructure
and services to capitalise on the emerging information superhighway.
<P>
The Premier told Parliament the Government was well advanced with
a strategy that would open the way to enormous efficiencies in
government, improved service delivery for Victorians and dramatic
expansion across the communicatons and multimedia sector.
<P>
'The Government has set the groundwork, for the strategy with:

<UL>
<LI>The establishment of a special Cabinet Subcommittee;
<LI>Formation of a working group of senior public servants to
identify opportunities for application of multimedia technology
in government;
<LI>The appointment of the Victoriian Communications and Multimediia
Task Force of top level Government and private sector representatives
headed by the Premier;
<LI>The creation of an Office of Communications and Multimedia
within the Department of Premier and Cabinet to drive and co-ordinate
-.vork in this field from a whole-of-government perspective;
<LI>Provision of $3 million to back up the work of the task force;
and
<LI>The allocation of $80 million in last week' s Autumn Economic
Statement for technological projects across government over thee
next year.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The task force has set up three subcommittees - to promote business
development in communications and multimedia, specially in communications
systems and the software and content required to service the multimedia
industry, to act as an advocate on behalf of Victoria with industry
and other governments; and to advise on the Government's use of
multimedia technologies in its administration, service delivery
and communications.
<P>
Mr Kennet has detailed Victoria's initiatives in a letter to the
Prime Minister this week and sought a prominent role for the State
in the Commonwealth's establishment of the National Information
Services Council, the Australian Multimedia Enterprise and its
Co-operative Multimedia Centres program.
<P>
The Premier has suggested some overlapping membership beitween
Victoria's task force and the national council and that the multimedia
enterprise should be based in Victoria.
<P>
He also offered an initial contribution of $500,000 and ongoing
project support for the establishment of a Co-operative Multimedia Centre 
in Victoria.
<P>
&quot;I am particlarly excited about the possibilities for Victorian
firms to carve out a major role in The global provision of multimedia
products and services,&quot; Mr Kennett said. &quot; addition,
 the Government will use the power of communications technology
and mullitmed to transform the way it provides services to and
communicates with the public.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The Government  is acting quickly on a wide front to maximise
opportunities an edge on competing locations both within Australia
and in our region.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We have set objectives that over the next six years the
Government should develop extensive communications and multimedia
networks and services, and that the industry in Victoria should
achieve pre-eminence in the field.&quot;
<P>
The Government is already trialing new technology in satellite
links to school, InterNet access, telemedicine in health diagnostic
services and the digitisation of Film Victoria's library.  Further
trials are proposed in delivery technology, including broadband
trials conducted by carriers, kiosks to provide street-front delivery
of Government services and information, and promotion for the Victorian 
food industry.
<P>
Advanced communications networks are being established within
the public sector, and the Premier said it was envisaged the systems
being developed for the Government would be marketable to other
governments in Australia and overseas and, in some cases, to the private 
sector.
