MUNI BRIEFS

First-time buyers of municipal bonds are quick to pick up on the
apparent contradiction of double-A-rated bonds yielding less than
supposedly more secure triple-A insured bonds, according to Robert W.
Chamberlin, senior vice president and chief municipal analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
     While Chamberlin and other analysts agreed there is no simple
explanation, they all said supply and demand is a major factor behind the
difference, typically four to eight basis points.
     "In pure economic terms, a lot of anything tends to cheapen the
price -- even with something that (in theory) should be high-priced,''
Chamberlin explained. "That clearly is what is happening with triple-A
rated bonds.''
According to the Public Securities Association, almost 45% of
new municipal issues came to market with insurance in 1995.-- Jon Birger

Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., is working on separate legislative
proposals that would dramatically change municipal market disclosure and
make it harder for municipalities to file for bankruptcy.
     The legislation, which is still being drafted but could be
introduced during the next few weeks or months, stems from a hearing on
Orange County that was held last July by the House Banking Committee's
capital markets subcommittee that Baker chairs, an aide and other sources
said this week.
     Baker had said after those hearings that he planned to introduce
legislation to improve municipal disclosure and to make it more difficult
for local governments to file for bankruptcy.
     It is not yet clear what support Baker would have for the
legislation from congressional committees that have jurisdiction over these
issues or from municipal market groups.
     But the Public Securities Association and Government Finance
Officers Association plan to consider the draft disclosure bill at meetings
later this month, officials with those groups said. --  Lynn Stevens Hume

Environmental and transportation bills important to
infrastructure finance are expected to see a lot of congressional activity
this year -- but not necessarily passage.
     Lobbyists and analysts give flow control and drinking water
bills better chances for final action than reauthorization of the Clean
Water Act. On transportation, the House is expected to take more initiative
than the Senate in laying the groundwork for next year's debate on
reauthorizing a major 1991 highway law.
     Analysts Debra Coy and Gregg Orrill of Washington Analysis,
which is part of the investment banking arm of the HSBC Group, said in a
recent report that drinking water and flow control bills, along with
Superfund legislation, "continue to be our best bets for completed
environmental legislation by mid-1996.''-- Martha M. Canan

Potential changes in federal funding will move to the front
burner as the number one item affecting state credit ratings in 1996,
according to a report from Moody's Investors Service released earlier this
year.
     Health care and welfare are the areas in which state credit
quality is most vulnerable, the rating agency said, emphasizing the
widespread reliance of states on federal support -- and voter pressure for
lower taxes.
     But Moody's said ratings changes this year do not have to be all
one-way.-- Peter List

The National Association of Bond Lawyers is calling on federal
regulators to withdraw the long-pending private-activity bond rules, offer
a new set of proposed regulations for comment, and move quickly to make
them final.
     Although a number of issuer groups have suggested re-proposing
the private-activity bond rules, this is the first time the bond lawyers
association has called for a newly proposed set of regulations since the
rules were first published in December 1994.
For a number of reasons, "including the significance of this
regulatory project and its widespread impact on state and local
governments, we believe that re-proposing the proposed regulations with
modifications and amendments would be the most prudent way to proceed with
this project,'' NABL said in a letter released earlier this month.-- Joan
Pryde

Rep. Christopher Cox is working with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to draft legislation that would simplify municipal disclosure
and make it more like corporate disclosure without repealing the Tower
Amendment to the securities laws.
     The draft legislation may also propose setting federal
requirements for municipal financial reporting, accounting, and auditing.
     "The idea would be to avoid any conflict with Tower and to avoid
the imposition of any new costs'' or burdens on issuers and other market
participants, Cox, a Republican from Orange County, said in an interview
Jan. 5.
     Cox said he hopes to have a draft bill ready within 30 days to
discuss with state and local groups, the Public Securities Association, and
other municipal market participants.
     "I intend to work closely with the commission and with
interested market participants for an extended period before introducing
the legislation,'' he said.-- Lynn Stevens Hume

LOS ANGELES PLANS TO SELL ONTARIO AIRPORT BONDS IN APRIL

The City of Los Angeles Department of Airports will sell
between $90 million and $150 million in revenue bonds this spring to pay
for a new terminal complex at Ontario International Airport in Southern
California's Inland Empire.
     The financing team is already in place. The financial
advisers are Lazard Freres & Co., Charles A. Bell Securities Corp., and
Marilyn L. Garcia. The agency was working with Lazard Freres' Los Angeles
office before it closed. The firm's relationship with the city continues
from its New York office. O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles is bond counsel.
     The Ontario bond issue, tentatively scheduled for April,
will be for about $90 million if the department builds only two terminals
in the new complex and leaves space for a third structure to be built
later.
     But the city also sought construction bids for building all
three terminal buildings to see if it could get an attractive price, given
the current weakness in the state's construction industry. Construction
bids are due Jan. 26.
     If all three buildings are constructed at this time, the
project's cost will be $343 million, with bonds financing $150 million of
the project, said Kathy Van Ness, deputy management analyst for the
department.
     "We've been having some protracted discussions on the
structure of the bond issue," Van Ness said. The agency is discussing how
to finance the project using airport revenues, passenger facility fees and
federal grants.
     Last year, the department refinanced revenue bonds tied to
Los Angeles International Airport so it could remove covenants that
prohibited the use of airport revenues for non-airport uses and restricted
the transfer of airport revenues to the city's general fund. In addition to
LAX and Ontario, the department also runs the city's Burbank Airport and
Palmdale Airport.
     In last summer's bond sale, the department included
insurance at the bidder's option that was provided by FGIC. It's uncertain
whether the agency will offer enhancement on the Ontario issue, Van Ness
said.
     Ontario handles 6 million passengers a year in its fast-
growing service area that includes five million residents and covers San
Bernardino and Riverside counties, and portions of northern Orange County
and eastern Los Angeles County. By comparison, 50 million passengers travel
through LAX annually.
     Ontario airport's lower profile among investors will be a
challenge for the agency. Van Ness said she is considering offering an
optional tour of the airport and region to the ratings agencies.
     Passenger traffic at the airport, located about 35 miles
east of Los Angeles, has increased steadily for the past decade.
     In 1975, 1.29 million people used the airport. In 1993, 6.2
million travelers used the airport and 353,000 tons of air freight were
shipped from the facility. The new terminal complex will provide capacity
for 12 million passengers.

MWD HOPES A BOND RALLY WILL PERMIT REFINANCING

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
spent much of last week watching interest rates, waiting for the
opportunity to sell a $200 million refunding issue.
     "We need to get down to record low interest rates to do
this deal," said Bert Becker, chief financial officer for the MWD. As
California Public Finance was going to press Jan. 10, Becker said interest
rates were about "20 basis points away from our target."
     "There's still some optimism from several economists and
brokerage firms that there's still some hope for a rally," he said from his
Los Angeles office.
     Becker, who described the market-sensitive bond sale as a
"day-to-day, week-to-week" situation, said he's hopeful the deal will be
completed this month.
     Smith Barney Inc. is the underwriter. O'Melveny & Myers and
Robinson & Pearman are co-bond counsel. Hawkins, Delafield & Wood is
disclosure counsel and Fulbright & Jaworski is underwriter counsel. O'Brien
Partners Inc. is serving as financial adviser.
     Bond proceeds will be used for both advanced and current
refundings.
     The refunding will include a 1991 offering that helped pay for
work on the district's Eastside reservoir project and Jensen treatment
plant.
     The district is paying an average interest rate of 5.6% on
its outstanding debt of $2.1 billion.

POLLUTION AUTHORITY SELLS $11.2 MILLION ISSUE FOR RECYCLING

The California Pollution Control Financing Authority sold
$11.2 million in revenue bonds to build recycling facilities in Contra
Costa County.
     Bond proceeds from the Dec. 7 sale will allow Contra Costa
Waste Service Inc. to convert an existing building into a materials
recovery and transfer facility and build a processing facility in
Pittsburg. The project, which will process 1,500 tons of solid waster per
day, is expected to create 17 jobs.

BANKAMERICA OPENS ATLANTA OFFICE

BA Securities Inc. opened a public finance office in
Atlanta Jan. 2 to work on muncipal securities and corporate-related
transactions in the tax-exempt market. The new office is the third public
finance unit that BankAmerica has opened in the last two years outside of
California. In October 1993, the company opened an office in Dallas, and
another in Chicago in May 1995.
     The office is headed by J. David Hospodar, an Atlanta
resident who has worked for Goldman, Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston. The
bank is likely to gradually add staff in Atlanta.
     "We're looking for additional people -- and it's a buyer's
market right now -- so I'm taking my time," said Anthony J. Taddey, senior
managing director.
     The firm also has public finance offices in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and in Seattle through the banking company's Seafirst
subsidiary.

MERRILL LYNCH MOST ACTIVE UNDERWRITER IN 1995

After a tumultuous year in public finance in which several
firms left the business and the aftershocks of Orange County's bankruptcy
were felt nationally, many look forward to a brighter year ahead.
     Merrill Lynch & Co. topped the list of lead underwriters in
California for full-year 1995 despite its ties to Orange County. Merrill
Lynch worked on 40 bond issues in California totaling $3.3 billion, giving
the firm a 16.5% share of the market. Issuers the firm worked with last
year included the State of California, the San Diego County Regional
Transportation Commission, San Bernardino County, Los Angeles County, and
the City of Long Beach.
     "We hope to see more issuance at the state level" this
year, said H. Cody Press III, managing director and manager at Merrill
Lynch in Los Angeles.
     Other players also see increased activity this year.
     "I see volume about 10% higher than last year nationally,
and maybe a little higher in California because our recovery is underway,"
said Anthony J. Taddey, senior managing director at BA Securities Inc. He
also anticipates a very strong note season in California this summer.
     Michael P. George, managing director at J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. in San Francisco,  said he expects "clients will continue
to be very judicious about bond issuance."
     "There will be more strategic financing and less clean,
plain-vanilla financings," he said, adding that issuers will be under even
greater pressure to do more with fewer dollars.
     Merrill Lynch was followed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the
most active underwriter in California last year. Goldman worked on 27 deals
totaling $2.3 billion for an 11.4% market share.
     PaineWebber Inc. followed with a 10.6% share of the market.
The firm worked on 43 issues totaling $2.1 billion in principal amount.
     Smith Barney Inc. was the fourth most active underwriter,
handling 44 issues totaling $1.8 billion in principal amount. Smith Barney
held 8.9% of the California market.
     Rounding out the top five was Morgan Stanley & Co., which
handled 10 issues totaling $1.6 billion. The firm captured 8.1% of the
market. Morgan Stanley's 1995 major clients included the City of San Diego
and the San Jose/Santa Clara Clean Water Financing Authority.
     Among bond counsel, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in San
Francisco captured the top spot in both California and nationally.
     "While Orrick has been ranked number one for seven of the
last eight years, holding that position for 1995 is particularly gratifying
in light of the nearly 50% reduction in dollar amount of debt issued by the
State of California," said Roger Davis, chairman of Orrick's public finance
department. Davis also anticipates the state will be a more active issuer
this year.
     Orrick served on 215 issues with a principal amount of $8.3
billion, giving the firm a 41.4% market share. Following Orrick was Jones
Hall Hill & White; Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth; Pamela S. Jue P.C.;
and O'Melveny & Myers.
     The most active financial adviser last year was Public
Financial Management Inc., which worked on 30 issues in California with a
principal amount of $2.9 billion, giving the firm almost 15% of the
California market. Following Public Financial were Public Resources
Advisory Group, O'Brien Partners Inc., Seidler-Fitzgerald Public Finance,
and Kelling , Northcross & Nobriga Inc.

SNOWFALL IN EAST BOOSTS BAROMETER

In an unusual week in which the Blizzard of '96 hindered market
activity, the California Debt Barometer's yield jumped seven basis points
to 5.74%.
     Among the larger deals underway in California last week was the
tentative sale of $200 million in revenue bonds from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California. The district was waiting for lower
interest rates to complete the transaction, which is being handled by Smith
Barney Inc. (See story on Page 1.)
     An $85 million revenue bond issue from the California Health
Facilities Finance Authority, originally planned for last week, was
rescheduled for this week. PaineWebber Inc. is handling the transaction.
     Elsewhere in the market, bond fund managers remained generally
bullish and continued to favor discount and noncallable bonds, Cadmus Hicks
wrote in his weekly market report for John Nuveen & Co.
     As the barometer data were gathered, the Bond Buyer's 30-day
visible supply of new issues expected to come to market within the next
month stood at $4.74 billion.

MENLO PARK ISSUE ENJOYED RIGHT TIMING

The importance of timing a bond sale was apparent in this
month's sale of Menlo Park Community Development Authority's $32.3 million
tax allocation refunding bonds.
     The deal was among the first out of the gate this year,
coming to market on the morning of Jan. 2.
     "We priced it first thing Tuesday morning, right after the
holiday," said Richard G. Kiss, a managing director at Piper Jaffray Inc.
in San Francisco.
     Trading got off to a quiet start that day, but by midday
activity picked up.
     "We did exactly the right thing because I don't think we
could have achieved those levels" later in the week, Kiss said, adding that
the final decision to price Tuesday morning was made at a 6:30 a.m.
conference call that day.
     Cadmus Hicks at John Nuveen & Co. in Irvine also noted that
"the deals priced earlier in the week did extremely well."
     Menlo Park wanted to achieve $1 million in present-value
savings through the refinancing of bonds originally issued in 1988 and
1992. The Silicon Valley community achieved that objective by realizing
$1.04 million in present-value savings, Kiss said.
     Menlo Park originally planned to sell the bonds in the
second week of December, but the market moved away. Wishing to avoid
pricing the bonds during the slow holiday period of late December, the city
decided to wait until this month to sell the bonds.
     The original bond proceeds paid for improvements in housing
projects, a senior citizen center, and other capital improvements in the
redevelopment area in the city's Belle Haven neighborhood, said Uma
Chokkalingam, Menlo Park's finance director.

SF SHOPS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown announced in his inaugural
address Jan. 8 that he is considering financing $150 million in affordable
housing.
      Details were sketchy on how the bond financing would be
structured. In his speech, Brown suggested that some of the money would be
raised through a tax-increment bond issue.
      Word has it that San Francisco's new mayor is considering a
$100 million general obligation bond issue and a $50 million tax-increment
issue, tied to the city's Golden Gateway Project Area.
      Brown also noted in his inaugural address that the city
must invest in its infrastructure, with or without state and federal
dollars.
      Brown's reference to infrastructure is another sign that
public finance issues will get more attention from the general public this
year as San Francisco and other California cities try to meet public
service demands with increasingly scarce dollars and debt capacity.

LAWMAKERS KICK OFF NEW YEAR WITH BIG BOND MEASURES

The California Assembly elected a new speaker and agreed to
place a $3 billion school bond measure on the March ballot when it
reconvened Jan. 3.
     The Assembly elected Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, to be
the body's fourth speaker in the last 12 months after ousting Brian
Setencich, R-Fresno, who held the position with primarily Democratic
support.
     The school bond measure received a vote of 68-to-6 in favor
of placing it on the March ballot. The proposal died in the final hours of
the 1995 session when Republican lawmakers linked their support of school
bonds to Democratic support for prison bonds.
     The $3 billion bond measure for the March ballot would
provide more than $2 billion for school rehabilitation and construction and
$900 million for improvements to state college and university campuses.
     The outcome of the election is somewhat uncertain,
especially given voters' current mood to limit government spending and to
keep tax dollars at the local level, instead of sending them to Sacramento
and Washington.
     At the forefront of the effort to persuade voters to
approve the school bond measure will be the California State PTA.
     "There are a lot of people who are concerned about
government debt, and it's not a concern to be taken lightly," Betty DeFea,
director of legislation for the PTA, acknowledged. "It's like personal and
corporate debt, however. You have to realize what it is you're going into
debt for and then assess whether it's worth the financial risk."
     "Schools and children are worth that up-front investment,"
she said. "It's wise not to put ourselves in bonded indebtedness for
everything we want, but some things we need."
     Education was also a priority reflected in Gov. Pete
Wilson's proposed $61.5 billion budget, which was announced Jan. 10. Wilson
proposed spending more money on schools, canceling fee increases at
colleges and universities, and providing a tax cut for almost every
California resident.
     The governor is asking Californians to approve $7.8 billion
in bond measures to help pay for new schools, prisons, juvenile jails and
the replacement or seismic retrofitting of state roads and bridges.
     State Treasurer Matt Fong and Finance Director Russ Gould
will be going to New York later this month to discuss the state's financial
plans, among other matters.
     "While infrastructure needs require $7.8 billion in
additional debt, those bonds will be issued by my office in a prudent
manner, balancing the necessities with our ability to pay for them," Fong
said.
     "Californians may be in a better position to take on more
bonded debt because our economic outlook remains positive," he said. "For
the fifth year in a row, revenues exceed general fund expenditures,
demonstrating that government spends within its means."
     "The investment community does recognize our state's
improving performance. Often our bonds trade at the double A rate, rather
than at the single A rating," the treasurer said.
