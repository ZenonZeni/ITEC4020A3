The Army has thousands of tons of obsolete chemical warfare agents stored
at several sites across the U.S., the bulk of them dating back to World
War II. A treaty with Russia, as well as concerns about the safety of long-term
storage, has prompted plans to dispose of these chemical weapons within
the next 10 years. Although new technologies such as biological degradation,
plasma destruction, and supercritical water oxidation are under consideration,
the preferred method of disposal is incineration, which can build on the
most extensive industrial experience. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1991, I have been involved in a large interdisciplinary research effort
designed to help the Army ensure that the incineration process is safe and
complete. The two main thrusts of the program are improving our understanding
of the combustion chemistry of the chemical warfare agents and developing
real-time monitoring techniques to determine whether proper combustion conditions
are maintained during incinerator operation. The other Cornell faculty members
involved in the project are Fred Gouldin (also in Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering), Terry Cool (Applied Physics), Paul Houston (Chemistry), and
George Wolga (Electrical Engineering); the work is sponsored by the Army
Research Office. Recently, a related travel grant from NATO has allowed
us to begin a substantive collaboration with scientists at Sandia National
Laboratories, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the
Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Most of the Cornell
faculty, including myself, will travel to Novosibirsk for brief research
consultations during the next two years; several Russian scientists will
work in our laboratories for more extended periods.<BR>

<HR>My research is mainly in the combustion chemistry part of the research
program. The simplest description of combustion - the reaction of fuel with
oxygen to form water and carbon dioxide, while releasing heat - indicates
only the gross endpoints of the process. To understand pollutant formation
and to identify appropriate compounds for monitoring, it is necessary to
learn the details of the destruction mechanism. Combustion occurs through
a combination of physical processes such as diffusion of heat and radicals,
and chemical processes such as fuel pyrolysis, attack by highly reactive
radical species, and radical recombination reactions. Even simple hydrocarbon
combustion involves a large set of sequential and competing reactions -
for example, a complete combustion mechanism for even so simple a molecule
as methane involves tens of species and hundreds of reactions. Larger molecules
such as the chemical warfare agents have more decomposition pathways open
to them. Incineration of chemical warfare agents is further complicated
because phosphorus, fluorine, sulfur, and/or chlorine are present, and because
temperature and the extent of fuel/air mixing vary significantly from one
part of the incinerator to another.<BR>
<BR>
In order to understand the combustion chemistry of the chemical warfare
agents, my colleagues and I are performing a series of experiments in a
variety of combustion environments. Although our interest is in the destruction
of nerve agents such as sarin, we perform our experiments with a family
of much less toxic &quot;simulant&quot; organophosphorus compounds with
some chemical resemblance to the real chemical warfare agents. Each experiment
is designed to highlight a particular class of combustion reactions. For
example, in our flat-flame burner experiments we use a relatively stable
simulant molecule; this choice minimizes the importance of unimolecular
decomposition reactions and makes radical attack the dominant mode of destruction.
The relative simplicity of a given experiment gives us some hope of understanding
the decomposition mechanism relevant to it. By combining data from several
experiments, we will build a chemical kinetic mechanism that is valid over
the broad range of conditions present in an incinerator. The development
of a detailed mechanism may also lead to advances in other areas; for example,
phosphorus compounds have been proposed as additives for fire retardancy
and for increasing the combustion efficiency for hypersonic aircraft propulsion.<BR>
<BR>
My research involves experiments in (1) a low-pressure premixed flat-flame
burner (joint research with Fred Gouldin) and (2) a turbulent flow reactor
for pyrolysis studies. Graduate students Eric Zegers and Daniel Sokol, postdoc
Scott Hurst, and I have applied a variety of techniques to study the decomposition
of simulant molecules in the two experiments. Undergraduates play an important
role in the research program. Last year Aaron Levine and Jim Sperry, M&amp;AE
seniors, designed, built, and tested an optical system for directing an
infrared beam through the gases above the flat-flame burner, to allow in-situ
measurements of combustion products' infrared absorption spectra. The following
semester Aaron wrote a program to determine temperatures above the burner
from the infrared absorption spectrum of carbon monoxide. In all, seven
undergraduates have contributed to this project, two of them supported by
Cornell - NASA Space Grant summer fellowships. <BR>

<HR>Sampling and analysis of the organophosphorus compounds pose huge challenges:
the extremely low vapor pressure and high polarity of some of the decomposition
products make it extraordinarily difficult to get the sample through an
analytical device without loss of important constituents. On many occasions,
our main research question has been, &quot;Where did the phosphorus go?!&quot;
Non-extractive measurements, such as the in-situ infrared absorption technique
described above, may be our best way of avoiding the sampling difficulties.<BR>
<BR>
Having solved some of the organophosphorus analytical problems, we have
been able to move on to more interesting questions, for example, &quot;Does
the presence of phosphorus inhibit the flame?&quot;, &quot;What mechanism
is responsible for the formation of certain observed products?&quot;, &quot;How
quickly does decomposition occur?&quot;. No one measurement technique will
provide information about all the species present in a flame; thus it is
vital to combine data from many types of measurements. We test hypothetical
decomposition mechanisms for consistency with all the experimental results
and for plausibility. Our work is reaching an interesting point, where results
of many experiments and computations are beginning to fit together and provide
a general picture of the organophosphorus combustion process.<BR>
