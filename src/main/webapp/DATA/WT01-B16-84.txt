<H3>Uranium Mining Operation in Spain. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/riosbio.html">Jose-Miguel Rios</A>, Javier Arnaiz, Marcial
Criado and Antonio Lopez.</H3>


The uranium division of ENUSA is responsible for uranium mining and production in Ciudad
Rodrigo, Salamanca province. Activities are based on open pit mining, heap leaching, and
dynamic leaching. The paper describes technical innovations in the field of uranium concentrates
production introduced by ENUSA in order to cut production costs, and to improve
decommissioning processes.

<P>
To cut production costs firstly the best possible information on the deposits must be obtained so
as to plan mining operations accurately. These investigations are concentrated in the  FE  area
at Ciudad Rodrigo, and concern information on grade and tonnage forecasting; distribution of
the ore; barren areas suitable for waste dumps; design of haulage roads; and characterisation of
the ore. Phases of the process which have been upgraded are ore body modelling by geostatics
and other methods; economic optimisation of open pit design, the objective being to design a pit
to yield maximum value and which will, once worked out, permit remaining lower-grade ore to
be mined if necessary; and estimation of recoverable resources under different economic
conditions.

<P>
ENUSA's innovations in mining include increasing the height of the working bench from three
to six metres; replacing semi-automatic pneumatic drilling equipment with totally automatic
hydraulic rotopercussion equipment, which cuts operating costs by 50%; increasing the diameter
of the bore holes, enabling spillable explosives to be used, which moreover are produced locally;
increasing capacity of buckets and dumpers; and automating radiometric procedures.

<P>
Total production of concentrates, from three plants, is 4149 t of U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>. Improvements in the
minerallurgic operation are based on concentration of uranium in fine fractions of the mineral;
automated plant control; and improved safety and radiological protection. These have allowed
production to be maintained at 300t annually. Overall productivity improved from 0.7t U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> per
man-year in 1981 to 1.6 t U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> per man-year in 1994. There have also been staff reductions and
total quality programmes.

<P>
A description follows of the decommissioning and restoration at La Haba (Badajoz), which
comprises an open pit mine plus its waste rock disposal areas; the Lobo-G hydrometallurgical
treatment plant; depleted ore from heap leaching; and a tailings dam. Conclusions drawn from
this exercise as reference for future closure plans are: an integral closure programme for the
mine s various component parts confers significant advantage; use of the waste rock to fill the
open pits and cover the tailings dams aids site restoration; assessment of the long-term
radiological impact should be based on the natural background level of the zone; closure criteria
(e.g. of long-term stability of refuse storage systems) facilitate viability of closure by
conventional means; and restoration of the mining site allows large surface areas to be returned
to other uses.
