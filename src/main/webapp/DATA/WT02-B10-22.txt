l-Selegiline Treatment for Survival Curve Shifting</i></font></p>
<p>OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, March 27, 1996 -- Deprenyl Animal
Health, Inc. (NASD OTC Bulletin Board: DAHI; Toronto Stock
Exchange: DAH) today reported that it received from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office a &quot;Notice of Allowance&quot; for
a patent covering the company's veterinary pharmaceutical
Anipryl&#174; (l-selegiline) to extend the life expectancy of
dogs. </p>
<p>In a two-year &quot;blinded&quot;, placebo-controlled trial
conducted under &quot;Good Laboratory Practices&quot; using 41
age-matched pairs of laboratory beagles, dogs between 10 and 15
years treated with l-selegiline daily had a statistically
significant increase (p = .024) in life expectancy compared to
placebo-treated controls. While the mechanism responsible for
increased life expectancy is unknown, DAHI believes that this
patent provides broad patent coverage for use of l-selegiline in
geriatric pet dogs. </p>
<p>This patent for &quot;survival curve shifting&quot; in dogs is
the sixth U.S. patent issued to DAHI covering new uses of
Anipryl&#174;. In addition, the company holds two European
patents for Anipryl&#174;. </p>
<p>Anipryl&#174; is approved for treatment of canine Cushing's
disease in Canada, and DAHI is expected to complete its first
shipment of the pharmaceutical this month. The Company has filed
its Phase III-equivalent clinical trial report with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration covering the use of Anipryl&#174; therapy
in treating canine Cushing's disease. Approximately 165,000 cases
of canine Cushing's disease are diagnosed each year in Canada and
the U.S. </p>
<p>DAHI is currently evaluating its options for distribution of
Anipryl&#174; in the U.S., including negotiating with several
companies to establish a marketing alliance. Marketing rights in
selected European markets have been acquired by Hoechst
Veterinae, which is conducting clinical trials. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health was established in 1990 to develop
animal health applications for Anipryl&#174;. The Company is also
identifying other animal health product opportunities to become a
multi-product animal health pharmaceutical company. </p>
