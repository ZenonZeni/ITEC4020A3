<p><b><i>Fish Reproductive Physiology/Marine Toxicology</i></b> </p>

<p>Purification and molecular actions of hormones and their receptors,
environmental endocrinology, applications of endocrinology to fish culture;
biochemical and environmental toxicology of marine fishes, especially reproductive
and endocrine toxicology. </p>

<p><b><i>Research Interests</i></b> </p>

<p>Most of the complex series of morphological, physiological, behavioral
and developmental changes that occur during the teleost reproductive cycle
are thought to be under endocrine control. However, the hormonal regulation
of many reproductive processes remains poorly understood, especially in
marine perciform fish, which represent the largest order of extant vertebrates.
Extensive research on Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout in our laboratory
has identified several novel features of the endocrine control of reproduction
in these marine perciform fish, particularly during final oocyte maturation
and spawning. Research is being conducted on the purification and biological
actions of pituitary hormones and steroid hormone receptors, the cloning,
sequencing and expression of their mRNAs, the neuroendocrine control of
gonadotropin secretion, the biosynthesis and molecular actions of steroid
hormones, the physiological regulation of steroid hormone receptors, the
endocrine control of egg growth, spermatogenesis and meiotic maturation,
and applications of endocrinology to fish culture. The goal of this research
is to develop a comprehensive model of the endocrine control of reproduction
for representatives of this important vertebrate group. </p>

<p>The release of toxic chemicals into marine and estuarine environments
has increased dramatically as a result of rapid industrialization in many
regions of the world, but the long-term ecological consequences of increased
environmental contamination are not known. The development of early-warning
biomarkers of pollutant exposure may enable deleterious changes in the
environment to be detected early enough so that remedial actions can be
taken. Our research emphasis has been on the development of endocrine biomarkers
of impaired reproductive function in marine fish because relatively low
pollutant concentrations can disrupt fish reproduction with serious consequences
for the long-term survival of the entire population. The mechanisms of
chemical interference with reproductive endocrine function, the physiological
functions of ovarian and hepatic metal-binding proteins, and the role of
maternal transfer in the embryotoxicity of chemicals are under investigation.
In addition, reproductive biomarkers are being evaluated in fish collected
from contaminated sites in Texas and California. </p>
