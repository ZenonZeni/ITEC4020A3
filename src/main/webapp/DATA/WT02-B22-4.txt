<H2><CENTER><I>Who will be president in 1996 and why?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PREZ -->
<LI>Bill Clinton all the way.  
<LI>Bill Clinton I believe his philosophy is more socially and economically inclusive than Bob Doles.  
<LI>Dole: to downsize the federal gov't and reduce taxes increasing the domestic revenue so to keep reducing the deficit
<LI>Clinton should be re-elected.
I don't trust Dole's story about tax cuts.
I think Dole and Gingrich would destroy Medicare.
Dole voted against Medicare in 1968 and re-affirmed his vote 5 months ago.
I Despise Newt Gingrich!!!
<LI>Harry Browne. He espouses my philosophy pretty close and I am sure he means what he says. I doubt that the "big three" are saying anything except campaign rhetoric.
<LI>Ralph Nader.  Although unrealistic to expect his election, I certainly would like to see that because he stands for the same principles I do - purity in democracy, with the citizens at the helm.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Two words: Smaller government!
<LI>Harry Browne, because he would eliminate the national debt and end the income tax. 
<LI>Dole, because Clinton is a clown and a liar.  The media is carrying him.  
<LI>Ross Perot. He has great ideas for major problems. In the debate they just bashed eachother and did not get to answer any hard question that had to deal with the real problems. 
<LI>Bob Dole. He has the right ideas and he is a true leader.
<LI>Either the Libertarian or Green candidate. Individual freedom, but
protect people and environment from harm by individuals and corporations
<LI>Bob Dole. He has the right ideas and he is a true leader.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  I think he has done a good job and I think that he would be able to accomplish more he congress would cooperate.
<LI>Harry Browne - He is the only legitimate candidate that is
intent on reducing the size and expense of the government.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The major problem in America is the size, extent and influence of government; Browne is the only candidate who is really, truly dedicated to drastically reducing government.
<LI>CLINTON--REASONABLE & ATTAINABLE SOLUTIONS. DEMONSTRATES ABILITY TO ARRIVE AT THE BEST PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS THAT ARE POLITICALLY FEASABLE FOR THE TIME BEING. LAYS LEGISLATIVE GROUND WORK WELL.
<LI>Bob Dole, to return integrity to the White House and break the back of big government liberalism.
<LI>Harry Browne. He advocates exactly what I believe in: smaller 
government, returning federal powers to state control, protection 
of civil liberties, lower taxes/less government services, etc. 
<LI>Harry Browne.  Our government is bloated and intrusive.  It is destroying the Bill of Rights and everything that this country once stood for.
<LI>No comment. But someone who is going to positivly affect our society economically and morally. BOB DOLE YEAH!!!
<LI>Bill Clinton.  I feel better off today than 4 years ago and 
our economy is strong.  Bob Dole comes across negatively and 
certainly not "presidential"
<LI>Bill Clinton; Because out of the possible candidates he will be the best for the country
<LI>Harry Browne
The only one who understands what this country was founded on
<LI>Harry Browne. I want the government out of my wallet, bedroom,
business, and life.

<LI>I believe that character is one of the most important issues.
How can I believe anything someone says if they do not have character.
I will vote for Dole as the best candidate among the potential winners.
<LI>I would like to see Harry Browne because his party and platform are the only one's consistently based on a single overriding philosophy: unlimited individual freedom with concurrent responsibilities
<LI>Harry Browne - he is against censorship,
wants to end the war on drugs, and repeal
laws against victimless crimes.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He understands the Constitution and its limits on the federal government and protection of individual rights.
<LI>Bob Dole because he understands the proper role of the federal government plus he is a leader that can be respected.
<LI>Ralph Nader: he is pro-civil liberties and anti-big business. what i used to think of the democrats before i was disillusioned

<LI>I believe Bob Dole is the best for president because I feel
 Bill Clinton has lowered the high .
 standards that have been the bulwark of our nation.

<LI>Bob Dole is a liberal.  I cannot vote for a liberal.  In my state Howard Phillips is not on the ballot, therefore I will vote for Harry Browne
<LI>Bob Dole because he is not a draft dodging, pot smoking, wife
cheating, sexual harrasing, stand for nothing worm like the current occupant of the Office
<LI>I would like to see Bob Dole for president in 1996 because I believe that he will restore the morals of this economy by setting a good example for our children.  He will also improve the economy and foreign relations, and his plan for education will greatly improve our schools.
<LI>My children will be paying off the national debt with very oppressive taxes unless something is done now.  Harry Browne offers the only solution.
<LI>I want Harry Browne because he is the only canidate commited to reducing the federal government to it's Constitutional  mandates.
<LI>Clinton - Dole is an old, out-of-touch dottering senile relic of a time that never was.
<LI>I would like to see Fred Rogers run for president with Mr.McFeely as his running mate.  Because as far as I'm concerned the candidates now are living in the land of make belive anyway.
<LI>John Engler..Gov of Michigan...good politics and a strong sense of priorities
<LI>Bob Dole.  Bob Dole is good.  Bob Dole. Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Vote...Bob Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne. A Libertarian President to begine with, and then House and Senate members are the only hope this country has.
<LI>Bob Dole, He will improve the U.S. majorly!!!
<LI>Dole--Higher moral standards, trustworthiness.
<LI>Any person other than Dole.  He is too old and is a very mean man.
<LI>Howard Phillips
<LI>Bob Dole,because I know that he will help decrease the amount of
government in our lives.  Bob Dole will also restore the respect
and honor to the high office of the president.  Bill Clinton is
a disgrace to the highest office of our land.  By the way, I am
a former democrat.
<LI>Harry Browne. He stands for real freedom and making govt do what it's suposed to. 
<LI>no foriegn aid, bring all the troops home, uncap the oil wells divert tankers to Japan to U.S.
<LI>Harry Browne, I believe he will and can do what he says.
<LI>I'd like Harry Browne to president in 1996 because he has a consistent, simple philosophy about government's role. Furthermore, he believe the Constitution should be our guiding light. No other representative holds these views and plans on implementing them if elected.
<LI>H.Browne - might tell the government that the people are tired are tired of being "lied" to and "stolen" from.
<LI>Dole, because Clinton is a crook!
<LI>DOLE- THE CLINTON SCANDAL OF THE WEEK PRESIDENCY IS OVER! WHERE IN HISTORY CAN YOU FIND A LEADER WHO HAS ANYONE HE HAS EVER ASSOCIATED WITH IS 1). A CONVICTED FELON, 2). ENDITED & AWAITING SENTENCING, 3). ALREADY ASSUMED ROOM TEMPERATURE DUE TO SOME FORM OF ARKANSIDE ???  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT NEARLY AS STUPID AS CLINTON & HIS BAND OF MARXISTS BELIEVE. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF FILES,...WELL MAYBE A HUNDRED,..WELL 3 TO 4 HUNDRED, WELL MAYBE 800,.... WELL OVER A THOUSAND....
SHAZAM....  I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW THESE FBI FILES GOT HERE?  WHO HIRED THE WHITE HOUE SECURITY CHIEF CRAIG LIVINGSTONE ?  GEE WIZ, I DON'T REMEMBER. HOW DO GARDENERS WITH GREEN CARDS FIND THE RESOURCES TO CONTRIBUTE $40K TO THE RE-ELECYION CAMPAIGN?  AS ERIC ENGBERG WOULD SAY " TIME OUT! "
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who deals with the economic
reality of today. He is the only candidate with and economically
viable plan for allow our country to prosper. To quote him, 
"Government Doesn't Work". We need more Harry and less
government.
<LI>Harry Browne. He is the only candidate that truly respects individual liberty. All the others want to make the individual a slave to one agenda or another.
<LI>Perot-It would definately shake things up in Washington, and possible 
knock some sense into those people that run things there.  Maybe they'd
start to think seriously about people and how they feel.
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate who has demonstrated that he is willing and able to return the U.S. government to a point more consonant with the Constitution and the vision of the Founding Fathers.
<LI>Dole . . He stands for the type of America that made us what we are and are now losing it with the Clintons moral outlook on life.
<LI>I want to see Bill Clinton for the 1996 president.  I want to see him as president because he has done a lot for the people.

<LI>Bob Dole.  The Democrats are steering this country straight into Socialism in conjunction with labor unions, teacher's unions, and lawyers.
In time, if they're allowed to continue, they will also break the bank.
<LI>I have no answer.
<LI>BIll Clinton, because he is the best candidate
 for the job and four years is not enought time to work his plan
<LI>no answer

<LI>Harry Browne to protetct civil liberties.
<LI>Return of America to a constitutional republic.
<LI>I would like to see Bill Clinton win the presdency again, becuase he is a very good president and he has done many good things. I hate Bob Dole!!!!!!
<LI>Browne or Perot.  Browne or Perot could run the government as a business, not a political machine.  Favor Browne since he has a political machine in place & operational.
<LI>Harry Browne- Libertarian. He is the only candidate that supports both individual liberty and personal responsibility.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he fights for the human right to freedom.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  He sees issues from both the business side of the 
coin and also the littl guy who is trying to make ends meet.
<LI>Ralph Nader, because he would protect us from the influences of
big business.  At least, he would try.
<LI>Bob Dole because I truly believe that I can not trust Clinton.  Clinton has made so many promises over the past 4 years that were not kept and now he is making a whole new collection for this years election.
<LI>clinton because he seems more credible and I believe that our
country has improved for the past 4 yrs.
<LI>Bob Dole. Because Clinton cannot be trusted. We need a man 
with  principles, not a con man/liar--of any party.
<LI>Bob Dole a man with character and morals.
<LI>Harry Browne, principle!
<LI>Jesus Christ, take a wild guess.
<LI>Dole, ethical, experienced, has moral values, not motivated by
ego.
<LI>This survey has limited itself by the same debate which has limited our political process.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he didn't do that bad for the last four years. I feel that if BOb Dole become president then the social welfare of the American society will be worse off than it was under Clinton.
<LI>Bob Dole because he is a moral and a man of good character.Bill Clinton does have any morals, and he is the world's greatest liar.
<LI>Howard Phillips US Taxpayers Party; because he is a Christian,
and would be the nearest to our foundation; out of the 55
founding fathers, 52 of them were Christian, including our first
few presidents!!!
<LI>Harry Browne, Freedom works.
<LI>Harry Browne is a lifelong enemy of intrusive government, has proven it by the life he's led, and won't change his mind if elected.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate with a principled stand of protecting our civil liberties.
The worst problem with our society is abdication of personal responsibility, which is fueled - at least in part - by big government.
Harry Browne, in his call to reduce the size of government, is in effect advocating a return to personal responsibility, which is a necessary ingredient in a free society.
<LI>Harry Brown, he's the only candidate who adheres to the philosophy
and principals of the Constitution and Bill of Rights as it was 
written by the founding Fathers. Only he has the vision to cut
through the last 80 years of socialist (13 planks platform)and 
laws and regulations.
<LI>Dole...we ca't afford another Clinton scandal...
<LI>Harry Browne. Platform I agree with.
<LI>Howard Phillips - sticks to the constitution AND is not a life-long politician.
He fits the mold of some of our greater presidents.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate proposing a reduction in  the scope of government.


<LI>someone, anyone who can lead.  someone who has vision, a passion for the job, and a global view of issues.
<LI>Harry Browne - he is the only candidate who truly intends to
reduce the government to what it was intended to be.  Right now 
the government absorbs a huge percentage of our GDP for vritually
no productivity on the dollar relative to privately employed
people.  This needs to change, and the only way to change it
is to get rid of the huge and hugely ineffecient beauracracy 
running our country.
<LI>[How could an answer to that question be anything *but* partisan
and rhetorical?!]  Harry Browne would dramatically reduce the size,
cost, and intrusiveness of Public Enemy #1, the Federal government.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Bill Clinton -The Republican Party is too much in the hands of the Religious Right, and other radical fringe groups.
<LI>Bob Dole -- to give the Republican Congress the opportunity to reverse 40 years of socialist policies
<LI>As a united states legal resident, i wold like to see Bill Jefferson Clinton as US's next president because he is no anti emmigrant as dole and the economy under him has been in good shape.
<LI>Dole because we need someone who has some morals.
<LI>Bob Dole because I believe Jack Kemp will promote the idea of
Bob Dole because I believe that Jack Kemp will be in a position to promote the idea of a major overhaul of the IRS and therefore reduce its impact on American lives.

<LI>Dole, because I agree with him on many of the issues

<LI>Bill Clinton because he seems to be the best canditate for the job.
<LI>Dole so he will implement the voucher system.
<LI>Harry Browne-He will not accept matching funds (it's welfare for politicians) & he knows that reducing the Federal govt to its constitutional limits will solve the problems in welfare, drugs & crime!
<LI>Harry Browne because he wants to reduce govt dramatically and abolish IRS and Federal income tax.
<LI>Harry Browne would be our best bet.  His book "Why Government
Doesn't Work" is a well thought out plan, with the kind of details
that tells me that it isn't just another campaign promise.
<LI>Bill Clinton, because his policies are already working,and are 
successful.
<LI>Harry Brown because he will adhere
to the Constitution and Bill fo Rights
<LI>no answer
<LI>Bob Dole, because I am strictly from a Republican family and I think that he will be a great president!
<LI>Bill Clinton because he stands for the American people as a whole and is willing to attack issues head-on.  He stands for Americans, not just rich Americans like Dole.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only political candidate dedicated to reducing the federal bureaucracy.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Clinton, for all his blustering, is a tax & spend
liberal (i.e., health care "reform"), who has no moral foundation
and cannot keep a promise.
<LI>Bob Dole:  I feel that he is smarter, more experienced, and more qualified to be president.  However, I also feel that he is a terrible politician and has great trouble getting accross his message.  As a result, I expect an electoral landslide in favor of Clinton.
<LI>Good standers, intelligence, an understanding of American's, commen sense, family values, a clean record.
<LI>Bob Dole -- I am tired of Clinton's class warefare, I want a revised Internal Revenue Code with flatter taxes and minimal deductions,  I am tired of Clinton discriminating against couples with no children in his tuition tax deduction.  Bob Dole is to legislation that Lyndon Johnson was to legislation and I believe we could get alot of good legislation under Bob.  There is and has been an odor coming from the White House and it is not getting any better.  
<LI>DOLE-HONESTY AND INTEGRITY WHICH ARE COMPLETELY LACKING IN CLINTON.
<LI>I want Harry Browne to become President.  He will start the needed redirection and reduction of the Government.
<LI>Clinton.  He seems to be willing to compromise without giving in.
<LI>Bob Dole - America needs a leader who is of high moral fibre and character
<LI>Harry Browne, because I basically support the Libertarian party.
<LI>Bill Clinton returned as president, and the congress to go democratic. We can no longer trust the erratic behavior of Newt Ginghrich and the republicans.
<LI>Since the invasion of privacy and scrutiny of those potential 
candidates that may do a better, are so all invasive, we are 
limited to those whose egos are large enough to be able to
handle the scrutiny, I vote for Clinton as a quantity that 
is known and whose publisized views are most similar to mine.

<LI>Bob Dole. I believe in his sincerity to bring this country 
together both morally and economically, and I believe he will 
turn control back over to the states where it belongs. 
<LI>Howard Phillip for President.  The USTP has a platform and has promoted that platform and stayed on course.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Clinton's promises of more government will reduce the work incentivese of the aMERICAN PEOPLE.
<LI>n/a
<LI>Bill Clinton for 1996 president.
He is in the presidental office and is aware of US situation.
<LI>Bill Clinton. Because his first term was a productive and memorable one. I feel he did a great job. If given another chance, he can do the same, but better. He is honest and seems to think on the same level as most Americans.
<LI>I want to have a president that will make sure that our amendment rights are protected.
<LI>Bob Dole, he is a better man and has better ideas for America.
Clinton offers nothing but fear.
<LI>Lots of work,
<LI>Bob Dole --- He has the experience and character to move this country forward.
<LI>Not Bill Clinton...an abyss of moral aptitude.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only intelligent choice among those offered.

<LI>Harry Browne. To get the Government out of our lives.
<LI>I only want DOLE because he is lesser an idiot than CLINTON!  Jack Kemp is Doles best quality. 
<LI>Bill Clinton.  I think that Doll is very honest, but unwilling to accept many modern concepts
and beliefs.  I think Clinton is more in touch with plans that will work right now.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who will get the monkey of government off our back.  He will eliminate income taxes, personal and corporate welfare, and bring prosperity to the country.
<LI>Harry Browne. The only candidate to offer a constitutional alternative to the current federal bureaucracy.
<LI>Clinton.  He is very bright, and extremely competent.  He has been very responsible fiscally
<LI>Bob Dole, because of his more conservative economic plan to
decrease federal government's power and give more freedom and
power to the citizens.  
<LI>Dole because he is the right man for the job 

<LI>dole. we can not stand another of bill clintons tax cut.
<LI>Hillary Clinton because she's an intelligent woman and a good
feminist.
<LI>Harry Browne for President. He's not a politician. He acutally
believes that he's identified problems and believes in the solutions
he's proposed. No other candidate can say that truthfully.
<LI>either harry browne or john hagelin, because i agree with both of their principles.
<LI>Bill Clinton shows that he could responsibly reduce the deficit 
and manage to protect the environment, the economy and the American
family.
<LI>Harry Browne, who is the only candidate who promises to restore the federal government to its Constitutional limitations.

<LI>bob Dole. I think his ideas are better for our country than President Clinton's
<LI>ralph nader, third party politics, grassroots politics, no big business backing
<LI>Clinton, because he has a vision of where this country should be headed. He also has a track record.
<LI>I want to see Bob Dole as president.  I think he is trustworthy, and holds himself to reasonably high ethical and character standards.
<LI>Bill Clinton--I do not agree with everything--especially moral issues.  I think he has tried more for the common person
<LI>Harry Browne or Howard Phillips because these two men value the constitution above political issues of the moment. 
<LI>Bob Dole.  He is against abortion, and stands for higher tax breaks in our government.
<LI>Browne--the only candidate who supports personal responsibility & freedom
<LI>Clinton.  Because he's not in the pocket of the Religious Right.
<LI>Howard Phillips, because he is the only 100% pro-life candidate.
<LI>Bob Dole will be the next president because of his genine love of country.
 
<LI>Harry Browne
It is time for a change in the way we have been doing things.
Without quoting the 10 Amendment, it is the states who who should
be handling the peoples affairs. U. S. Goverment is too large. 
<LI>I hope that Bob Dole is elected president because he, unlike President Clinton, will reduce our taxes and the government.
<LI>Harry Browne; eliminate the IRS & get the govt back to basics.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who understands the critical importance of freedom in a society.  The others only give it lip service.
<LI>I would like to see The President be reelected because I feel he is more in tune with whats  we need and what will keep the ecconomy on tract. Thank You
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is a business professional, excellent public speaker, and could be an effefective political leader.  He is truthful, and is loaded with common sense.  He has not just come out of the woodwork.  He has expounded Libertarian principals for many years.  He would be a breath of fresh air where now there is only stagnation.
<LI>Bob Dole - he's honest, truthful and a man of character. He has
served his country faithfully thru the military and the Senate and
has proven himself a worthy candidate. One who would bring 
honor back to the presidency and respect back to the country.
One more term with Clinton will surely destroy this country.

<LI>The only candidate standing up for personal liberty and individual responsibility is Harry Browne, Libertarian.  I'd love to see him as President, so America can once again be the land of the free -- become one of the brave: vote for Harry Browne!
<LI>Bob Dole because the President should be a person who has experience and integrity and can be trusted.
Additionally, the President should seek to get the Federal government in line with the 10 th Amendment.
<LI>Harry Browne. He is the only candidate who will reduce the fed gove to its constitutional role and give states their constitutional authority. This will be painful for everyone at first, then ultimately benefit us all.
<LI>I feel Bill Clinton has  better understanding of the issues and problems hat we faces a nation.
<LI>Harry Browne - Browne is the only candidate concerned with solving our number
one problem- the size of government.
<LI>Nader - He's the only candidate running who I feel can actually be trusted.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Experiance.
<LI>I want to see Harry Browne elected so we can get rid of all the non-essential government employees who we don't need.Let 'em get A REAL JOB!

<LI>Harry Browne. The gov't of the united States of America has no
Constitutional authority to regulate education, fund welfare,
prosecute Citizens for drug or firearms crimes, regulate health
care, provide "social security"--a Ponzi scheme, barbecue its
Citizens (innocent or guilty), tax the American people, interfere
with or fund political activity of foreign nations with our
confiscated monies, maintain a standing army on our Land, enter or
honor a treaty that supercedes the Constitution for the united
States (UN Treaty), or so many more illegal and immoral activities
that this socialist government (which Hillary stated she and Bill
are trying to achieve) continues to pursue. Mr. Browne will make
America a prosperous and free nation during his first year in
office.
<LI>Harry Browne: his libertarian philosophy, less govenment, abolish
the IRS, protect civil liberties, legalize drugs,abolish FDA
<LI>Harry Browne is my choice for President in 1996 because he is the only candidate of any party that advocates views that 
closely mirror my own.
<LI>Nader: agree with his stance against corporate welfare and the 
way that political campaigns are financed. 
<LI>Bob Dole because of his honesty, integrity and experience!
<LI>When America called, Bob Dole gave his right arm,  Bill Clinton gave his middle finger.
<LI>Bill Clinton should, and will, be president again because he cares
about helping everyone, not just his friends, family and the rich.
<LI>Anyone but Clinton.
<LI>Harry Browne--He's correct. Government doesn't work. The bigger the government, the less it works.
<LI>No answer
<LI>Keyes comes closest to elucidating workable answers to the problems we seem to be facing.
<LI>Ross Perot, I think it's time we had a president who has an expertise in business.
<LI>If it's working don't fix it. It's got to be Clinton.
<LI>President Clinton. He brings new solutions to many of the problems we are now facing. Furthermore, he also understands that true democracy cannot stand by itself if we only apply capitalism.
<LI>Harry Browne best understands the nature and limits of government.

<LI>colin powell.  He seems to be the only sincere person on the spectrum.
<LI>Ross Perot for the following reasons:
1. - Changing electoral vote into a popular vote
2. - Run the country as a business
3. - Shut down the special interests in our government
4. - Downsize goverment
<LI>A president without a past of drugs,infidelity,pardoning of drug
dealers,murder and abuse & misuse of power.
<LI>honest bob
<LI>I want to see Clinton I hope he can put into practice some of the things he really wants now that he won"t have to worry about re-electoin.
<LI>Harry Browne because the solutions of the two major parites do not work. Like Browne's ideas or not, they head in very different directions and these directions need to be investigated to see if they work.
<LI>Harry Browne would eliminate not only the deficit, but the debt 
with his economic plan.  He would also drastically reduce crime 
by eliminating its major source:  Drug LAWS.
<LI>I want a Libertarian government that will properly limit the Federal  government to the things it is Constitutionally empowerd to be doing, ending the reign of terror of the left- and right-wing socialists of the two major parties.
<LI>browne-less government and more personal freedom
<LI>Bob Dole;
Rightiousness and virtueness should be the character of the man in the White House and Clinton is not the man to be there.
<LI>Bill CLinton, because I think he has done a satisfactory job so far and Bob Dole is just too old to represent this country and those who are a part of it.
<LI>Pat Buchanan; if that could be possible.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The only candidate who I believe genuinely wants to downsize government.
<LI>Bill Clinton.
<LI>Bob Dole.  He's moral & ethical.  He's conservative.  He will help scale back an expansive & intrusive gov't.  He will cut gov't spending & truly balance the budget.
<LI>Dole in 96 - Clinton fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.
Clinton can not be trusted to keep any promises and will walk on any one that gets in his way, mostly the little guy.
<LI>Howard Phillips-Do not want to vote for lesser of two evils, want to return out government to the ideals established in our Bill of Rights and the Constitution.  One nation under God.  We should not develop man's, God has established His law and on this law our system of govenment should be based.
<LI>Howard Phillips
<LI>Bob Dole.  I just feel that Bill Clinton is too willing to tax, and spend in a time when the economy is still fairly week and should be nurtured by giving the available funds to the people, and let them use their discretion with them.  I believe that the Market does everything better than government, some people just think it socially unacceptable.

<LI>Libertarian Harry Browne--the only candidate who is serious about cutting government and taxation, as evidenced by his refusal to accept matching funds.
<LI>I want to see Bob Dole as President in 1996.  I do believe honesty and integrity are critical to the Presidency.  I believe the Federal Government has far exceeded its realm as defined in the Constitution.
<LI>Bob Dole, He is really focused on people taking responsibility for themselves and their actions, and bettering our (US Citizens) family values. I believe that he will do a lot to stop illegal immigration as well.  The fact that is pretty old,does however throw a strike against him. He is the best candidate in the election this year.

<LI>HARRY BROWNE.  To end income tax , ballance the buget, pay off debt
                and bring back the CONSTITUTION as the rule of law
                there is no other choice
<LI>Mr. Dole.  His 15% Tax cut would help the economy, and his subsequent Tax reform program would help everyone in the country.
<LI>Harry Browne-Libertarian, He is the only candidate who
will not be lying if he took the oath of office.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who promises to make huge,
drastic cuts in the size and scope of the Federal Government.
Scott Swain
<LI>Dole, he is cool and experienced

<LI>Bill Clinton, because he is as close to a liberal as we can
reasonably hope for given the conservatisim of the times.
<LI>I believe that Gen. Colin Powell represents the best that the country has to offer America in the way of President.  I believe that Bill CLinton's character is flawed at best, and that he should not run this country.
<LI>Bob Dole- Bill Clinton is sorry!
<LI>Bob Dole would be a prime candidate, because of his background, and superior choice of a running mate.  I would feel safe with Kemp as president if anything were to happen to Dole.
<LI>I will vote for Harry Browne because he will end the insane war on drugs and because he is the only candidate who will reduce the sixe of government. Clinto wants to increase the size of government 4% per year and Dole want to make it bigger by 3% per year. Harry Browne is the only candidate who wants less government - LESS, not less growth - Less government now!
<LI>Of the candidates that will be on the ballot I will choose Harry Browne.

He states very clearly what he believes and wants to do when elected.
He wants to reduce the federal government to its constitutional mandated role.
He wants to elimate the many unconsitutional federal agencies such as IRS,
Dept. of Education, Federal Reserve, etc.

<LI>Harry Browne.  His goals are clear.  His methods have been
explaned in detail.  If he is elected we will know what to
expect.  (as opposed to the other canidates that will randomly
damage some freedoms, in order to give us other random 
"entitlements")
<LI>Bill Clinton because he had done pretty good during the past few years in office. Plus I have doubts about Dole's proposal.
<LI>I'd like to see Harry Browne as President as I think the Libertarian
platform is miles in the right direction of reducing federal government and 
privitizing those services the citizens desire.
<LI>Harry Browne.  We need to get the government out of our business.  Once we do this then maybe we can fix some of the problems that plague our country.
<LI>President Bill (I didn't inhale, but I would if I got a chance) would say anything or do anything to get re-elected. If this country votes for him, they deserve what they get in the next 4 years, he has no more re-elections so he can do what he wants, even by Presidential Order, if necessary.
<LI>Bob Dole should be elected, because he's a man of integrity and understands our position in the world.
<LI>As a registered Republican, I feel that we are better off today than we were four years
ago, therefore President Clinton is the only REAL choice.
<LI>DOLE, BECAUSE CLINTON WILL BE FORCED TO RESIGN IF HE IS RE-ELECTED. HIS MORAL CHARACTER IS SO BAD THAT IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO ME AND THE COUNTRY.
<LI>Harry Browne.
<LI>Dole; Self control, Morality, Anti-beaurocratic, Trusts the people, A clear unwavering vision 
<LI>President Clinton has succeeded in passing into law such things as the Brady Bill, assult weapons ban and has signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  He has also worked to protect our environmental laws, reduce the dificit, and create new jobs. The economy is growing at a steady (non-inflationary) pace and I personnaly am much better off than I was 4 years ago.
<LI>pat buchanan for his stand against any form of abortion. and his views of the morial decay of society due to the absence of god in the family.

<LI>Browne. Less government. Self resposibility. Self ownership.
<LI>Someone honest enough to confront problems *responsibly* and working to AVOID politicizing these critical issues.  Unfotunately, I doubt that either candidate will really do that...
<LI>Harry Browne, he seems to be the most reasonable of those I have 
heard, the only one who doesn't seem to be a politician.
<LI>Bob Dole he has the ability to get the job done.

<LI>As a human being, I own myself and no one, especially government, has any business telling me what to think or how I must spend my money. The Declaration of Independence articulated this well and the U.S. Constitution was established to guarantee those rights! Therefore, I support the party founded on the basic prinicple of liberty--I support Harry Browne for president.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Conservatives want to cut taxes, lower spending and
make the government smaller.
<LI>Dole the least of the two eviles.
<LI>Brain, he is in touch with the majority of the american public.
<LI>Ross Perot, because he is the only candidate that has shown
any intelligence in the problems of the U. S. A., he is realistic.
<LI>Dole!!!!!
<LI>I see Clinton as being elected, mostly because of the successful lies and the obvious bias of mainstream media (i.e. New and even sitcoms)
<LI>Harry Browne makes no attempt to be all things to all people,
slinging around the tired rhetoric of a wishy-washy, indecisive
candidate with amorphous ideals.  The time has come for a government
firmly grounded in its dedication to preserving civil lib...
oh wait, I was about to turn this into a partisian/rhetorical
argument :-)

<LI>Harry Browne is the only choice for President that has the courage to stop the Congressional and Judicial branches of our government in their vote-pandering, influence-peddling, tax-us-into-financial-disaster tracks.

<LI>harry browne as he is the only candidate worth a damn.
<LI>Bob Dole because he will bring honor and integrity back to the office of President.
President.

<LI>bill clinton- i feel that he is the best candidate
<LI>Howard Phillips, because he agrees with all of my views.  I like Libertarrians,
But not where they stand on moral issues.  Phillips has it right.
<LI>Bill Clinton because Dole is too old, too conservative, and too much of an old Nixon man
<LI>A want a president who will protect Civil Liberties and the
Environment.
<LI>Bob Dole
Clinton displays poor leadership at home and around the world.
<LI>Dole-He is more honest anf presidential with a lot of government experience
<LI>dole  character matters

<LI>I want to see Ross Perot for president in 1996 because his concerns are mine and because I believe in him.
<LI>clinton be cause he is doing a good job
<LI>ROSS PEROT, ONLY ONE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP, THE PEOPLE.
<LI>Harry Browne and his libertarian ideas could return us to the limited government that is the only good government. Government has the potential to do extreme damage, so it must be extremely limited.
<LI>Bill Clinton because i beleve he should stay in office because he works very hard and Dole is way to old to be in office.
<LI>Bob Dole because of leadership character and experience
<LI>Harry Browne because he has specific and do-able plans to liberate everyone in the USA and potentially the world.  God gave us free will to co-create and manifest our "reality."  Let's just do it.
<LI>Harry Browne -- A strong believer in fiscal responsibility, the reduction of government, and the protection of civil liberties.
<LI>Bill Clinton,although not my first choice,is the only candidate who has an ideology close to my own and has a realistic chance of winning.
<LI>Perot, I believe he will address our need to reduce government and make an attempt to reduce the amount of money I give the government every week.
<LI>Harry Browne all the way.  The federal government has gotten WAY
too large and intrusive; its time to hit the reset button on the
federal government.
<LI>Howard Phillips, we need to trust in God for our future. God gives us government and it should not be corrupted by money, lusts, and selfish ambition.
<LI>Clinton=Socialism. This is America. Socialism in any form is not
allowed. Pretty simple. Dole is the only viable candidate excluding
Socialists...this election should be an easy choice for all voters.
<LI>Harry Browne.  We must take from Federal government powers not specified in the Constitution.
<LI>Harry Browne - the only real alternative to the big-government
policies of the Democrats and Republicans.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE - HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO WILL LIMIT GOV'T TO THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM NECESSARY.
<LI>Bob Dole, his vision outshines that of our current prez.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he is the best candidate for the job.
<LI>Dole because I think that Cliten is a liar and only does what is best for him.
<LI>Howard Phillips because he seems to want to downsize government 
and he is against abortion. We have become too socialist in our 
government.
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only one who WILL cut spending,
ELIMINATE TAXES and reduce the size of government.
<LI>Dole because Cliten SUCKS
<LI>Dole
<LI>Bob Dole because even his critics say that he's a man of his word.
<LI>Bob Dole is the only candidate with a "Less Government" stand who will be taken half way seriously by any significant portion of the electorate.
<LI>Dole because he comes across to me as a person I can trust. Clinton 
would be great as a Used Car Sales Manager. He would get top
dollars for this position.
<LI>Harry Browne because he understands that government is force and force should only be used for defense or retaliation...it's immoral to initiate force (example: taxes)
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who can fix this mess that
Dems and Repubs got us into.
<LI>Harry Browne, but failing that, Clinton. The republicans need to be taught a lesson that they can't win an election with the same old crap they have always done, picking a candiate merely because it is "his turn" and sabotaging the candidacies of Forbes and Gramm.
<LI>I want Harry Browne to be the next President because he is the ONLY CANDIDATE who will dramatically reduce the size of the Federal Government to the level that our Founding Fathers and the U.S. Constitution and our Bill Of Rights had originally intended.
<LI>Harry Browne... Smaller Gov't. It's time for a change....

<LI>Though I'm not a big Perot fan, his VP Pat Choate, is the most intelligent and well-spoken of all the candidates. He should be primed as a legitimate candidate for 2000. Then, this 
nation's economic woes have a chance of ACTUALLY being fixed. As for perot, dole & clinton: I really don't know who I will vote for yet.
<LI>Dole, otherwise our national debt will skyrocket.
<LI>Bill Clinton-He has our country moving forward-socially,economically,and morally.

<LI>Bob Dole because he is atleast trying to reduce the size of government  Also, he is pro-life which is extremely important to me.
<LI>I want to see Bob Dole a president because we need a honest man there not a womanizer,dope smoking liar and I might add draft dodger.
<LI>Anyone but a Democrat.  
<LI>Harry Browne - he's our best hope to slash government back down to its original, intended size.
<LI>Gen. Colin Powell. Becuase he is a patriot. He has fought for our country, and he is an outsider to the political arena of kickbacks, and porkbarrell politics.
<LI>Clinton has worked hard for this country.  His basic instincts are correct.
<LI>Bob Dole.  Of the two viable canditates before the American public,
his record of service to his country and his honesty and integrity
make him the only possible choice.  Bill Clinton is nothing more
than a charlatan and snake-oil salesman, who will say whatever it
takes to get a vote.  He has disgraced the office of President,
and should have been impeached long ago.  If the American people 
do not wake up and see this man for what he really is, then God
save us all.    
<LI>Browne represents what I want for my courtry and is HONEST.
<LI>bill clinton because he has restored usa to a world leader andmoral example to other nations.
<LI>Harry Browne.  I've voted Republican for years, but now I can't tolerate the religious overtones. 
I voted for Clinton as a vote against Bush. 
We need a totally new agenda, and I now know the Libertarians think the way I do.

<LI>Bill Clinton..he has proven his worth more than his predecessors
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the ONLY candidate this year to offer realistic, workable proposals for making real changes in the things causing most of the country's problems.  Thanks for giving us a chance to speak.
<LI>Dole. Because I think the President is a laughing stock of the whole world. We need a president that can't be indirectly connected to every scandal known to man. We need someone people can look up to.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the ONLY candidate this year to offer realistic, workable proposals for making real changes in the things causing most of the country's problems.  Thanks for giving us a chance to speak.
<LI>bill clinton  he is still a new comer to washington and  has a better view of the future for everyone
<LI>Harry Browne. The Dems And Reps are all BS. They have been running this mess forever and still can't get it right.

<LI>I want to see Harry Browne be elected to the office of President.  Mr. Browne has an understanding of the role of government!
<LI>Someone other than a ruling class weasel like Dole and Clinton
<LI>    Harry Browne, the Libertarian, is for Freedom in all areas.
Libertarianism is CONSISTENT; other political philosophies aren't.

<LI>Bill Clinton, he's a better choice than Dole, although I terribly hate to say so.
<LI>I would like to see a President that would take a positive handle on the nation and it's economy and also take responsibility for his/her actions as president.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is against censorship and wants to end
the war on drugs.
<LI>Harry Browne should be president because he supports reduction of government intrusion,
which happens to be the root cause of nearly all the "worst problems" listed in #2 above.
Reduce government intrusion and eliminate "seven in one blow"; what more must one say?
<LI>Bob Dole - a vote for anyone else is a vote for a pot smoking, womanizing, draft dodging, waste of sperm, Bill Clinton
<LI>harry browne because he is a hell of a guy

<LI>Harry Browne because he's the only candidate who will reduce government to its constitutional minimum and will promote civil liberties.
<LI>Libertarian Harry Browne because he/they are for limited government,
lower taxes, and both personal & economic freedom - what this country
should be about!
<LI>I want to see Harry Browne as President of the United States.  The Government should get out of the American peoples lifes completely.
<LI>I will vote for Browne because the more votes he gets, the sooner we'll elect Libertarians to Congress and/or force other politicians to reduce government power.  For now,  I hope Dole wins so that Republicans get throughly disillusioned with their party (even when they control everything, total government spending will not be cut by even one penny.)
<LI>I will vote for any candidate who is most likely to reduce the governments influence in my life.
<LI>Bob Dole.  A divided partisan representation between executive and legislative branch is of absolute no use.

<LI>Harry Browne -- not that he'd be able to implement Libertarian ideals but it's be neat to see them brought to the table at last.  We finally got someone in Washington who actually used her brain -- J. Elders -- and she was fired for proposing that we should reconsider a thing or two!  Hmmm.

Thanks - Tony
<LI>Harry Browne, I believe in his view that govenrment doenst work and that it must be reduced as much as possible.
<LI>bob dole...why should we suffer another four years of b.s. from a draft dodger, hillbilly, womanizer, follower, liberal.
<LI>Harry Browne! The U.S. Constitution is the place to start saving our nation. Any person or group that is willing to step outside the bounds set forth in the constitution and telling you that it's really for the best, is lying to you. HARRY BROWNE will bring the Federal Government back to it's constitutional limits and not "allow'', but rather "help" us restore our freedoms and deal with the nations problems as ADULTS, not as children that "higher-ups" in Washington must tell what to do. 
<LI>Bob Dole,
I think that of the two major choices, Bob is less
inclined to force more government down my throat.  He also 
opposes further gun control legislation.
<LI>Howard Phillips simply because he is dedicated to reducing government.
<LI>Clinton, because the economy has improved in the last four years.
<LI>Reagan with alzheimer's would make be a better President than either of these two major candidates.  That said, Bob Dole has the integrity, common sense, and experience to lead the nation in a better direction than it's headed now.
<LI>Bob Dole- He seems to have a trustworthyness about him!Bill Clinton on the other hand has had his chance and blew it with lies and deception!!!!!
<LI>I would like to see Bob Dole as our next President, mainly because I would like to see more integrity in thr white house!!!
<LI>Harry Browne will reduce the federal government back to its constitutional limits! He will also reduce taxes AND balance the budget at the sametime!!!
<LI>Ronald Reagan!
<LI>I believe that Bill Clinton is the better qualified candidate.   The Republican Party economic philosophy of "trickle down" economics has been proven not to work.
<LI>Harry Browne, because government has tried to solve social and economic problems for years and has never succeeded.
<LI>Harry Browne, he's the only candidate with the will (and the lack of PAC money) to cut the size of government and REVERSE the IMMORAL, DESTRUCTIVE, and UN-CONSTITUTIONAL trends of the past century.

<LI>The structure of this poll indicates that you support the notion that we cannot reduce taxes and the debt at the same time, therefor, it doesn't matter that I am supporting Harry Browne, because you are so entrenched in Democratic politics that this nation is doomed, anyway. Their goal of making Americans accept serfdom is complete. We've lost.
<LI>Harry Browne because he has no vested interest in big government.
<LI>clinton.  He has a better grasp of almost the issues and is more open to diverse viewpoints.                           
<LI>I want to see Harry Browne for president.  Government has grown too big, to intrusive, too expensive and too dangerous to allow it to continue on the path that the old parties have put it on.  We face a massive debt, all of our entitlement programs are on the verge of collapse and the young people of today will be left holding the bag for the irresponsible tactics of our parents.

<LI>Harry Browne.   He is the only serious candidate trying to Reduce the size of government. The Reps and Dems have lied too much already.
<LI>I would like to see Howard Phillips/Herb Titus for Pres and VP because they know their constitutional bounds and duties.
<LI>Bill Clinton shows the highest of moral standards, can play 
economic hardball, and doesn't lay down for any reason.
<LI>Bill Clinton - the Dole supporters I know are incredibly mean-spirited and bitter people.  I think hate radio is destroying their brains.
<LI>Clinton - Christian Conservatives are very scarey and have too much influence on the Republicans
<LI>Harry Browne - freedom must be put first and none of the other
candidates truly stand for freedom.
<LI>Harry Browne -- government is a barrier to peace and prosperity.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>Harry Browne because he wants to dismantle govt to the smallest size. This
which would protect civil liberties, and give the financial power
back to the people so that WE may solve our own problems. Big govt wastes
money that could be better spent by the private sector. 
<LI>Bill Clinton has 12 years experience as Chief Executive.  Life now in general is better than ever.
<LI>Howard Phillips.  The Federal Government is operating illegally outside the limits of the Constitution.
<LI>Smaller government, with a tough stance on abortion.
<LI>I believe Bob Dole can balance the buget and lower our taxes, only if the economy is strong. He has a good vision of our future.

<LI>A leader that can hear and is willing to listen the grass roots from inside the lofty tower, filled with the deaf and the corrupted.  
<LI>Dole-Clinton is a socialist & Hillary has a Woodstock mentality of government which means re-distribute the wealth & individual iniative is irrelevant
<LI>Clinton, because his ideas seem more sensible than those of dole.
On the contrary, if his wife is doing his work she really isn't doing a bad job.
<LI>My ideal choice for President is Nader, because he is the only candidate who is addressing the basic issue, which is the rapid change of America from a democracy to a corporate/media controlled illusion of democracy.  None of the other candidates are willing to admit that our government is now run by and for unelected big business personalities. 
<LI>Harry Browne, because he's the only candidate who stands for
individual liberty in all areas, and a sharply reduced
government.
<LI>Harry Browne for smaller govt, less taxes, increased personal liberty, reduced crime, legalized drugs, abolish laws and agencies that don't work, rethink foreign policy.

<LI>Harry Brown is the only candidate that can see a clear method of returning this country to the foundation it was formed on. Cut Government back to the Constitutional powers originally granted to it, take away the money and you put the power back where it belongs with the people. Harry Brown is willing to admit the truth - Government doesn't Work ! All the rest are liers and Thieves. Let the people vote with their money. Peaceful withdrawal of funds will allow the peoples voice to be heard. Income Taxes
have always been voluntary - Stop the IRS from coercing money to pay for beliefs that are against the Constitution.
Abolish the IRS. Abolish the corrupt FBI and ATF. Stop the government in its tracks every time it trys to moralize and establish a religion. Turn back to the communities to solve the communities problems and get the government out of our wallets!!
<LI>Bill Clinton because he has done a good job and the Republicans have gone off the deep end

<LI>Harry Browne-because he is the only cantidate with answers and real dealings with the issues rather than platitudes.

<LI>new candidate.clinton too crooked,dole too old.perot tooscary.
<LI>BILL CLINTON, HE IS THE BETTER OF THE TWO THAT IS RUNNING FOR PREIDENT.
<LI>Bill Clinton because watching Newt "effect" I was frightened by what Repulblicans and supporters(Radical Christian right, big business, corporate polluters,) et al would do.  Change of
goverment to a smaller focused body is critical.  The government should provide appropriate support and they must be there to keep watchful against those who destroy our country  as a whole, our environment, our social fabric
and allow us improve our families, our neighborhoods and our country.
make-up  (rich getting richer, etc)                                                                                                    
<LI>Harry Browne is the only one telling the truth about gov't.he is 
the 
<LI>Bill Clinton! The Republicans must be stopped! The lunatics on the Religious Right have to much influence!!
<LI>Bob dole-Cause Bill Climton is pice of----- theif!
<LI>Clinton.  I agree with his priorities.
<LI>Harry Browne, less government
<LI>Bob Dole - B.C. has shown he cannot keep his promises, so Dole needs a chance to keep his
<LI>Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne is extremely
articulate -- he's a polished candidate and would make a great
leader.  He's probably the most honest human being I've ever met!
<LI>Howard Phillips is my choice. Morality is a trickle down concept, as is
immorality.. our kids learn by example.  All things ARE connected.
<LI>Harry Browne will balance the budget in his first year and clear
the debt within five years.
<LI>Bob Dole, I think of the two, Trust.....
<LI>Libertarian Harry Browne is the only candidate with a solid, workable plan to reduce the federal government to its constitutionally mandated size and scope.
<LI>Harry Browne -- the only candidate whose position makes sense.

<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate talking about making government smaller and returning responsibility to the individual not other politicians.
<LI>Bill Clinton because I think he has done a good job for the past 4 years, even though he has had to fight the nay sayers since day one.  He has improved the economy and yes we are better off than we were four years ago.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate that get the gov't out of our daily lives, get us out of the UN immediately, bring our troops home, curtail foreign aid, and strengthen our defense system.
<LI>Bob Dole because I can trust him unlike Mr clinton who will be looking for the Polls to see what he should do in a crisis situation.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The present Federal Government is the greatest threat to our liberty in our countriy's history.
<LI>President Clinton may or may not have lived his life the way I would.  But I don't vote on a President for his own personal life.  I vote based upon what he has done or can do for our country.  The president has done a good job and I think he deserves a second term.
 
<LI>Browne, the only candidate who wants to lead us *away* from the precipice of national bankruptcy.
<LI>I want to see dole, a more honest, and honorable person representing our country.  There is no excuse to let a liar who want to TAKE CARE of america in the white house. We need to be responcible.
<LI>Bob Dole,  his past record, moral standards, honesty, concern for economic welfare of this country. He'll make the tax reduction work or adjust it.  The tax cut is not as important to me  as his character.
<LI>Harry Browne because the Democrats and Republicans are one and
 the same, Big Government and Lsightly Smaller Government.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he has a credible and honest plan for
restoring our freedoms by reducing the size and scope of the
federal government.
<LI>Bob Dole. I do not trust Clinton. He had his chance & screwed up.
Now it is time to step aside.
<LI>Bill Clinton. He has done a good jub so far and is the best man for the job.
<LI>Harry Browne!  End the income tax!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He's the only candidate who wants to shrink
government to constitutional size.
<LI>Bob Dole. I support tax cuts and less gov. involvment in our day
to day lives, basic conserv. policy.
By the way, tax cuts DON'T need to be "payed for".  Socialist
giveaways do.  
<LI>Bob Dole has better values 
<LI>I would like to see Harry Browne as President so that he can veto
every left-wing and right-wing collectivest program to come from 
the Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
<LI>Harry Browne...Please read his book "Why Gov't Doesn't Work" and the suggested reading list at the LP WEB Page. That should give you enough info to make "the" decision; Socialism or Freedom
<LI>BOB DOLE; Honesty,Integrity,Experienced & A strong defense.



<LI>Neither the Republican nor the Democratic party seems to think the american public is smart enough to control their own destiny.  I hope a Harry Browne will change this.
<LI>Bob Dole, becuase he will bring new un-liberal ideas into the White House.
<LI>Bob Dole - the Clinton administration is fluff without substance.  He cannot marshall support from his own party regulars on the centrist items he is touting.
<LI>Bill Clinton, simply because he has reduced government and had
<LI>Ross Perot, he is the only one that is more concerned with America rather than
being concerned just about government
<LI>BOB DOLE, HE CAN BE TRUSTED WITH THE WELL BEING OF THE UNITED STATES, HE'S HONEST AND HAS A BETTER FEEL FOR OUR COUNTRIES FUTURE.
HE SUPPORTS A STRONG DEFENCE PROGRAM. I AGREE WITH HIS APPROACH TO STRENGHTEN THE ECONMY.



<LI>HARRY BROWNE  We need to reduce taxes a lot.
<LI>Bill Clinton. We victims of the Reagan Revolution are just beginning to recover economically.
With 4 more years of Clinton and 8 more of Gore we might be back to where we were before that 
Fascist Republican Bastard came along. 
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he has delivered on most of his promises 
and none of the republicans had any plans on improving the economy
until Bill Clinton came up with his plans
<LI>I will vote for Harry Browne http://www.HarryBrowne96.org/ because he believes the Bill of Rights must be restored and because he will reduce the federal government.
<LI>Harry Browne. The Libertarian Party is the only party I know of that has a consistent philosophy of self-determination in both personal behavior and finances.
<LI>John Hagelin is the only intelligent candidate.
<LI>Harry Browne. Only candidate that seems to actually believe in freedom for
people.
<LI>Dole.  I think the president needs to be a leader with a long range vision and not a manager/supervisor whose policies are at the mercy of media interpretation and public perception.  Let the congress and govenors provide the management and supervison to support the vision of the president - all levels reflecting the voice of the majority.
<LI>Clinton for pres. because he will hopefully fund education for everyone, keep reducing the deficit, be a peacemaker in the world and at least vocally supports campaign finance reform legislation.
<LI>Harry Browne, he's the only candidate who seems to recognize the "Bill of Rights"
<LI>Bob Dole-He is not radical and has the same views as me!
<LI>Harry Browne...He is the only candidate who seems to be
saying anything that is legitimate for our future good.
<LI>Tired of BS.  Looking for someone who says what they mean, and mean 
what they say.
<LI>Harry Browne. He's the only candidate who has workable solutions for veering this country away from the abyss of destruction. I believe he is an honest and sincere man.
<LI>Browne is the only presidential candidate with legitimate viable
plans for making America work by returning power to the people.
<LI>Harry Browne.  Government doesn't work.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The only one with a plan to eliminate the deficit and 
debt, to return to a Constitutionally authorized government.
<LI>Bill Clinton and Al Gore as then represent me and my generation and my 
political philosophy and Bob Dole and the republicans are going 
right religious extreamism.  I would like to see the moderates retake 
the republican party.  I have voted for republican moderates.
<LI>Harry Brown. He'll reduce government, while protecting civil liberties and social freedoms. He'll run our country the way the founding fathers wanted it run.

<LI>dole - strong state-weak federal
<LI>james baker, because he has more experience with foreign governments than anyone else.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is a true libertarian who wants huge tax cuts NOW,
a balanced budget NOW, huge spending cuts NOW.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate in this race with a genuine committment to reducing the size and scope of government.
<LI>dole  The better man
<LI>Harry Browne (Libertarian).  Mr. Browne is the only candidate who favors large tax cuts and huge reductions in the federal budget and opposes government intrusion into our personal and financial matters.
<LI>Charles Collens, who is conspicuously absent from your list and
many others. He was the only one that saw the WHOLE picture.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only one who wants to significantly reduce government
<LI>Harry Browne presents a moderating view that will reduce the size of our overgrown beaurocracy.
He will also provide a neutral ground between the politically warring factions of the Demopublicans and the Republicrats.
The Libertarian view also will help the morale of the country by eliminating the oppressive elements that have crept into out government.
<LI>Al Gore
<LI>Clinton. He has compassion and can relate to the average person.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate who wants to reduce government intrusion in everyones lives.

<LI>Browne, the Libertarian Party has the most logical economic 
personal fredom stance.
<LI>Harry Browne.His plan is more firm and practical than anyone else's.
<LI>Ross Perot, a man with a genuine love for his country who will bring dignity back to the Presidency and reform government in the name of Lincoln, Jackson, and Washington.
<LI>Only Libertarian candidate Harry Browne can be trusted to limit government to its Constitutional (in other words LEGAL) functions.  I truly fear the United States government!
<LI>Bob Dole, because Clinton not much of a respectable person.  I do respect him for being the President, but not much more than that.
<LI>I would love to see Harry Browne win since he is the only candidate
who realizes that government doesn't work. He recognizes the fact
that more personal and economic freedoms would greatly increase
U.S. prosperity and security.
<LI>Harry Browne
We need to reduce government to constitutional size, thats why our founding fathers wrote it in the first place 
<LI>Bill Clinton
<LI>harry browne, because he is the only candidate who is addressing the real issues, regardless of the "politcal liablility" it may besow on him. We must reduce govt, and restore personal liberty and responsibility.
<LI>Harry Browne, the Libertarians.  His is the only platform which offers a genuine alternative to the basic premise of the old parties.  All other parties believe the arbitrary powers of government exist so they can take your money and spend it to compel you to live in accordance with their social, political - and yes, even their personal - goals.  Libertarians, in total contrast, believe that where governments are formed, they must not violate the rights of any individual.
<LI>Unfortunately, in this election year the difference between Republicans and Democrats is spelling.  I do not have a good feeling about either major candidate.  They are both politicians first and more concerned about themselves than their country. 
<LI>Harry Browne, because Liberty has primacy over Security, and Libertarianism is the only consistent principle (against tyranny over economic as well as social behavior).  He is the only rational alternative in an increasingly irrational world.
<LI>Bob Dole  Honesty, He Will Do More For The People                                                            
<LI>Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are men of character and of their word. What they say, they will do! It doesn't "take a village" to raise a child, it takes A FAMILY!
<LI>Bob Dole. Although he isn't my ideal candadate (Ronald Reagan is) he will sign important legislation from a republican congress. Also, when Dole announced his economic plan the liberal media smothered him on how the government could finance it. However, when Clinton/Gore announce new spending bills nobody asks how the American citizen will finance it!!!!!!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate that will really work
towards reducing the size of our overgrown goverment.  All
others are just playing lip service to the concerns of the public
over government grown amuck.


<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the only candidate who will decrease government.
<LI>Who: Harry Browne     Why: Libertarian Party platform
<LI>I am a "radical moderate", and dislike seeing politicians of both major parties fawning over their respective extremists.  I'll vote for Harry Browne as a protest vote.
<LI>bob dole
I'm worse off than 4 years ago not better.
<LI>Harry Browne...Government doesn't work and he is the only one who will do what he says he will do, reduce the size of government.  Unlike politicians who have gotten sucked  up by the system,  he is a free agent.
<LI>It is time for a change. Of all the candidates whose views I have been able to sample Harry Browne and the Libertarian Party come closest to what I believe is best for the country at this time.
<LI>Ross perot, because hi is insane
<LI>Harry Browne - Less Government
<LI>Harry Browne because he would radically cut government, end the War on (some) Drugs, and cut back the military to the small amount we need to just DEFEND ourselves.
<LI>Harry Browne (and I pray, enough voter/supporters to help him fix things)
My god America, WAKE UP and change things before we go broke(er).
<LI>I want no government controls of any person place or thing.
<LI>Howard Phillips should be President because his ideas are most
consistent with the wording and original intent of the Constitution.
<LI>Harry Browne, Libertarian.  He will reduce government
intrusion in our lives; eliminate income tax, welfare,
the fraudelent social security scheme, overseas foreign
policy misadventures, the "War on Drugs," and balance the 
budget.  Besides, I refuse to vote for the evil of two lessers
any longer.
<LI>Harry Browne, he has real ideas to solve problems others choose to ignore
eg. social security reform 
<LI>Mary Cal Hollis. She can cut crime, improve education, and fight oppresion.
<LI>Harry Browne because he is apparantly the only candidate who can read and write English. All of the other candidates feel they need an interpreter to understand the U.S. Constitution (which is not now officially recognized by the current government).
<LI>Harry Browne.  He's serious about reducing the federal government instead of arguing whether
it should increase by 3 percent or 4 percent.
<LI>Bob Dole, because  he wants to see all Americans prosper, not make all Americans poor.

<LI>Harry Browne. There are many candidates that want governement to
intrude on our lives, but only one who wants to leave us alone.
<LI>ross perot because we need a huge change that will show both political parties that we, the people, are fed up.
<LI>Browne, because he is my ideal candidate, but since this is
unlikely, I would prefer Dole to Clinton, because at least Dole
will not veto the Republican congress' better bills.
<LI>Harry Browne ; if we donot reverse the big govt. trend ,we will seea total govt. meltdown in about 20 years its simple math!!!
<LI>Bob Dole--He has integrity. He has a vast amount of knowledge gained from experience.  His ideas are sound.
<LI>I would like to see Harry Browne.  It is time to change the way
the government functions, and the Republicans and Democrates are
not interested in change.
<LI>I want to see Bill CLinton primarily because I trust that he will protect civil rights and, very importantly, the right of women to chose an abortion if she deems neccesary.  I do not trust Dole with either of these things.
<LI>Bob Dole. He more than Clinton can lead us rather than follow.
<LI>Bob Dole. He does not make lying part of his governing strategy
<LI>Dole.  Why?  I can't say without getting into arguement.
<LI>Harry Browne because he believes in the rights of individuals and freedom from government.

<LI>Harry Browne  - Reduction in government , increase in personal freedom and liberties, placing rsponsibilities back upon the  individual
<LI>Clinton is the only logical choice in an extremely poor field.
<LI>Harry Browne - The only candidate who believes in the Constitution.

<LI>make government more efficient,give education priority, protect individual privacy
<LI>I would like to see our next president start to make policy 
changes that will induce long term effects in the education of 
our young, the improvement in our economic practices both in 
regards to the environment and productivity, and the improvement 
of the U.S. education system.  Without these changes our short 
term wants could lead to the loss of our long term needs.
<LI>Harry Browne. Of your options above which don't include my views: 
No tax theft is acceptable, even a reduced rate; Perot should only 
be in the debates if it gets Browne in; a village is fine if it's 
not the government; Dole's tax cut doesn't go nearly far enough;
Marrou 92.
<LI>Harry Browne, the ONLY candidate with a real plan to eliminate the
National Debt, Cut Violent Crime in half and save our children from
a life of fiscal slavery at the hands of the government!
<LI>Harry Browne because he will help make smaller government

<LI>Harry Browne! He is the only candidate who has a plan to reduce 
the size of the government. Also he is the only candidate who 
didn't take matching funds; thereby proving he wants to fix the
problem, not become part of it.

<LI>Harry Browne, because we need GOOD MORALS, *ETHICS*, and COMMON SENSE in a MUCH SMALLER federal government.
None of the other 3 national candidates impress me as having a full deck in ANY of these areas.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he unwaveringly supports personal
freedom and responsibility on all issues at all times. He
understands that government is force, and should therefor
be reduced to the minimum necessary to protect people's freedoms.
<LI>Dole, he will sign republican passed bills.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate truly committed to real
goverment reduction -and- preservation of personal liberty.
<LI>get government out of our lives!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Mary Cal Hollis (Socialist Party USA)- because she is intent on putting an end to corporate welfare and military pork, while keeping in mind that people are more important than profits.
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate proposing a 
significant reduction in government and realistic methods for 
doing so without hurting people in the process.  
Thanks for hosting this forum!!!
<LI>Harry Browne, so as to not merely increase government spending by 20% over the next 4 years (under the Democrats), or by %14 (under the Republicans), but to actually cut the Federal Spending by 50% (or more) the first year in office!  Who else besides the Libertarians talk about actually retiring the entire Federal debt, much less getting a balanced budget?  Getting rid of the "Insane War on Drugs" (which is actually a war on children and civil liberties) is another major plus also.  When alcohol prohi
ition was repealed the absolute homicide rate fell for nine(9) years in a row!  Imagine that!
<LI>Harry Browne- The only hope this country has lies with 
the Libertarian Party.
<LI>I want to see Harry Browne in the presidency as he seems to 
represent a fair, logical, and principle-based stand on the
role of the federal government.
<LI>Ross Perot, because he seems to truely understand the problems facing the U.S. and will honestly work to serve all Americans including YOU the reder of this poll !!!
<LI>Bob Dole.  His plans are the most logical and have had proven results in the Reagan administration. 
Bob Dole.  His plans are the most logical and have had proven results in the Reagan administration.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate with a serious plan to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.  I'd like to see Harry Browne as President.
<LI>I would like someone who loves the American country and 
defends for her liberty and freedoms of life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.  Abortion is the opposite of 
life.  It is murder.
<LI>Dole, simply because of his moral and character leadership abilities.
<LI>Because Bill Clinton is a lying, cheating, idiot, whose wife really runs this country.
<LI>Quite frankly, I am a perfectionist, and I wish the imperfect 
government to leave me alone.  Harry Browne in '96 to reduce govt.
<LI>Ross Perot knows how to fix the deficit!  He is the only canidate who has any history of budgeting anything rationally.  The democrats and republicans just want to spend, spend, spend and make goverment grow, grow, grow while they slowly erode our civil liberties.
<LI>Clinton - more aware of today's issues and problems
<LI>Harry Browne, because he is the only candidate who is against the
insane "War on Drugs".  Prohibition didn't work in the 1920s and it
is not working now.  Drug prohibition provides huge profits to criminals
and fails at its stated goals of reducing drug abuse.  Drug abuse is a
medical problem and should be treated as such.  Drug _use_ is, as they
say, "nobody's business but my own."
<LI>Harry Browne because he is the only candidate that stands for individual liberty, responsibility, and freedom from government.
<LI>Howard Phillips.  USTP platform.
<LI>I will vote for Harry Browne and Jo Jorgensen.  I like what they
stand for.
<LI>Howard Phillips.  He's is the ONLY candidate running on a platform that combines the best of the others, while avoiding the worst.  e.g: I'd probably be a Libertarian if they didn't take such a casual attitude toward moral issues (abortion-rights, legalizing drugs, prostitution..etc)
<LI>Harry Browne.  He has the only honest platform.
<LI>HARRY BROWNE.  He'll fight against internet censorship.
<LI>Harry Browne, he understands what a monetary system is all about. 
<LI>Harry Browne.  The Democrats like to pick people's pockets.  The GOP
wants to have cops hit people over the head.  I'll go with Browne.
<LI>Bob Dole because we need:
A) To restore integrity and honor to the Presidency.
B) We need consistency and rational in the actions of government.
c) We need to take steps to prevent/reduce the impending fiscal
& economic crisis that will result from unbridled federal spending.
<LI>I support Harry Browne, because he has presented concrete, plausible plans to drastically reduce government and its intrusion into both business and people's personal lives.
<LI>Harry Browne - would repeal unconstitutional federal government
and repeal the income taxes entirely
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who has both a compelling
message about where America should be headed and a plan for
getting us there.
<LI>I support Harry Browne, because I'm pro-choice, because I support
free trade, and because I support immigrants' rights.
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>I think a vote of "No Confidence" applies to all candidates.
<LI>Who I want to see in the White House and who realistically
 has a chance of getting into the White House are two 
different people.
<LI>Bob Dole
Morals, Family issues, Veteran,
<LI>Harry Browne because he wants to DRASTICLY reduce gov.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate who respects the strict limitations placed on the federal government by the constitution.

<LI>Harry Browne, he's the only candidate that gives us even half a chance to 
get back to a Constitutional government.
<LI>I SAY BRING BACK AuH20!  FOR THOSE THAT QUESTION IT THAT IS BARRY GOLDWATER.
<LI>Harry Browne will reduce goverment.  Let the free market handle retirement,
medicine, and everything else thats not specified in the Constitution.
<LI>Dole - I want a man of integrity in my White House and as my leader!
<LI>Harry Browne.  Government intrusion has killed the family and the
community -- by REPLACING them.  Back to personal responsibility!
<LI>Harry Browne.  While I don't agree with everything he stands for, reducing the federal government and ending the insane "War on Drugs" are vitally important to keeping our civil liberties.
<LI>Bob Dole because he is of the upmost moral character as opposed to his main competitor. His economic plan is much stronger than Bill Clintons.

<LI>Harry Browne because his prescription for change offers a clear break from current trends and is a return to the constitutional principles espoused by our founders who rightly feared runaway government.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate running on principles--
The principles stated in the Constitution.
"Libertarians - Fouding Fathers and Future Leaders"-kc 
<http://www.harrybrowne96.org/> 
<LI>Harry Browne. He is the only candidate who understands Government Doesn't Work and, he would restore the Bill of Rights, particularly Second Amendment.
<LI>Harry Browne: He is the only candidate that has promised to reduce government to its constitutional limits and has a plan to accomplish the job.
<LI>Bob Dole because he is of the upmost moral character as opposed to his main competitor. His economic plan is much stronger than Bill Clintons.

<LI>Bob Dole
Character, Morals, Ethics, Veteran, He's The Man!
<LI>Harry Browne understands that to cut taxes, you must cut
spending.  
<LI>I prefer Mr. Harry Browne for president because hi is the candidate who stands for what I believe.  As a member of the Armed Services, my job is to protect and defend the Constitution of the U.S.  This is what Mr. Browne wants to do.
<LI>Anyone who will cede government power back to the people.
<LI>I do not want Cliton,but unfortunately there is not a canidate I can agree with.
<LI>Ross,  the two major political parties are loaded with faggits, nazis, and communists.
<LI>Bob dole because he supports less government, is against gay people, and abortion.

<LI>Harry Browne has the vision and a plan to reduce many of the ills of society and to return America again to a place where people can live a good life.
<LI>Harry Browne - I'm Tired of the same big-government answers to personal problems.
<LI>Dole, who else can you trust
<LI>Clinton.  He supports public education and higher education incentives.
<LI>Bob  Dole  has  the  moral  leadership  this  country  needs  if  we  are
to  survive  with  dignity  into  the  21st  century.
<LI>Harry Browne - he is the only candidate that I agree with on important
issues:  No military intervention overseas, no government intrusion in our
private lives, open immigration, no "war on drugs", no "legislated morality,"
and no more "victimless crime" offenders being jailed.
<LI>Harry Browne - America, freedom was the whole idea!
<LI>Harry Browne - He promotes the ideas of adhering to the Bill of Rights and personal freedom.  Every other candidate advocates more government control to solve our problems.  We've seen this fail time and time again.
<LI>Harry Browne is the only candidate willing to address major problems, i.e., the War on Drugs, the War on Poverty and our incessant foreign wars.  He will not tinker with or "reform" the federal government, he will get it back to Constitutional levels.

<LI>Bob Dole, because he is a man of conviction.  Not someone who sways with the wind.
<LI>Harry Browne because he will limit the intrusion of politics into
everyday life.
<LI>I would like to see Harry Browne as president in 1196. I believe that he would restore an American where the individual rather than the mob rules.
<LI>Harry Browne.  His entire platform is dedicated to returning the 
Federal Government to its constitutional limits.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  Simply, he's doing a great job!
<LI>Harry Browne.  He's the only one promoting minimal federal govt, no federal income tax and keeping the govt out of our lives
<LI>Ross Perot.  Because he and Mr. Choate are experienced in SOLUTIONS, not creating PROBLEMS. It seems that over the years we (the American people) have been asleep. It's time to wake the sleeping giant, and to require Government to be responsible and accountable for their actions and inactions.
<LI>Harry Browne to cut government by 95%.
<LI>Harry Browne !!!  He has not only listed out the things he would like to accomplish if elected, but exactly how he would accomplish them.  Call Ripley's IF Dole or Clinton ever do!
<LI>Harry Browne should be our president because he has a clear vision of the founding principles of our country, and is the only candidate who seeks to work to restore these principles which have been destoryed by years on neglect and government intervetion..
<LI>I am scared of the type of socialism Bill Clinton espouses.  Bob Dole is better than Bill Clinton, but HARRY BROWNE is by far the best candidate.

<LI>Harry Browne.  Mr. Browne is the only candidate who speaks to the
issues in a clear, consistent manner.  He is the only candidate
who truly recognizes that government is at the root of most of
our problems.
<LI>Harry Browne.  The government injustifiably involves itself with every aspect of American life.  
<LI>Ideally, I would have voted for Phil Gramm.  The media ignored him because he was Bill Clinton's worst nightmare.
<LI>Harry Browne, the only candidate with a consistent principled approach to the role of government.
<LI>Ralph Nader is the only candidate addressing the growing inequality, and corporate domination of America.
<LI>Harry Browne--because he is the only candidate who has a real and workable plan to eliminate government-created problems.
<LI>Neither Clinton nor Dole. They have nothing to offer this country except the same old political crap. We need someone who is truly concerned for the needs of the American people, not for the needs of their own or special interest needs.
<LI>Bill Clinton--I am from kansas. Bob Dole forgot Kansas years ago and started running for pres.
<LI>Harry Browne--he is the only candidate to present a 
credible, consistent, persuasive case for smaller 
government.
<LI>I prefer Bob Dole.  As Ross Perot says, who would you trust with your money.  Of course, if you don't care if it's used legally, then I guess you could give it to Clinton.
<LI>Dole/Kemp....It's the best choice of men to lead our country.  Clinton
and Gore remind me of those that threw bags of urine and dog crap at me when 
I got of the plane in Travis airport on my return from
Viet Nam.  I was drafted and my dad said Canada or the Army?
I had to make my choice of living with myself at the time, I
chose the service and a hopeful and safe return.  I made it.
Clinton and Gore have lied to themselves so much that the art of the
lie has permeated into the souls of this country so deep that
I feel in may be irreversable if they are elected.  If they are
re-elected, this is an indication of our country's soul. And if so,
God help us all.  Time to hed for the mountains.
<LI>Bob Dole - he is sincere, honest and has integrity.  It's time
we returned some dignity to the Presidency.  Clinton REALLY scares
me - another term will unleash him and Hillary.
<LI>Harry Browne for the 100% tax cut!  Harry Browne to eliminate the
IRS, cut government in half, Balance the Budget NOW, Tax Cuts Now
, Privatize and save Social Security NOW. Get the government off
our backs and out of our pockets and out of our bedrooms NOW.  
Harry Browne to restore the Constitution NOW and eliminate those 
government programs that exist beyond the scope of the 
10th ammendment.  Harry Browne to restore Prosperity to the 
land of the once free and home of the once brave NOW. 
<LI>Harry Browne.  Individual rights and responsibilities are 
supreme.  Government is wasteful and corrupt.  Eliminate the
Federal Reserve Private Banking Monopoly,  get us out of the
U.N., stop all government licensing, and leave us alone.
<LI>Harry Browne understands that government is analgous to a giant
cancerous tumor on the verge of killing it's host - citizens
<LI>Bob Dole should be the next president because I trust him to lead our country in the proper direction more so than I trust Clinton.
<LI>Bob Dole.  He is a better role-model for everyone.  He is more trustworthy.

<LI>Bob Dole/Jack Kemp:  Smaller government (not NO government, as the press would paint conservatives),
and less bureaucratic control of individuals' lives is critical to our nation.
<LI>DOLE
<LI>One interesting thing I note is that most of the people I talk to
who are against Clinton have an almost irrational hatred of the
man almost exclusively based on what they've heard on radio & 
television.  You can't talk to a single anti-Clinton person who
doesn't spew a bunch of unsubstantiated innuendo; the basis of
their prejudice is not logical.  If you look at Clinton's record
of accomplishments, it's quite clear he has worked very hard to
deliver on his promises. Anyone who expects too much from politicials
(in general) is deluding themselves, but I believe history will
show Clinton to be an excellent president, probably even better
than Kennedy. He supported a wide variety of very intelligent legislation
that various special interest groups love to demean but when you 
look at the facts, things like the Brady Bill, Family Leave, Feinstein
Amendment, Don't Ask Don't Tell in the military, are sound and
moderate proposals - they're not liberal - they just make sense.
Clinton WILL become re-elected because the American people are
stupid, but not quite stupid enough to think the republicans, or
any other candidate is being realistic in their promises or sincere
in their concern for the country's future.
<LI>The person who will revamp the goverment before Social Security is gone and before Medicare is gone and before we become tax slaves.  
<LI>Bob Dole because he has honest plans to make America a better place.
<LI>Bob Dole -- High moral and ethical charactor. His honorable service to America during war time. And his belief in the American people.
<LI>Bob Dole. We all must take more responsibility for our own lives. We have been giving away too many of our freedoms.

<LI>I want to see a communist revolution in 1996.
<LI>Either Ross Perot or Ralph Nader because they would shake things up
and boot out the entrenched special interests.
<LI>ANY OF THE THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES, AS THEY ARE PRESENTING REAL ISSUES UNLIKE  THE TWO BOZOS THAT ARE PART OF OUR PROBLEM.
