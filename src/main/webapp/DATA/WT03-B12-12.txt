VALUE-ADDED PROVIDERS FILL NICHE FOR BUSINESS
BUT IS IT REALLY EDI?

      Third-party service bureaus for electronic data interchange (EDI)
are a small, but rapidly growing segment of the EDI support industry
that can help smaller businesses comply with federal procurement
mandates.  But some industry insiders we spoke with cautioned against
relying on service bureaus to help you convert your business to
electronic forms.
      "It is not EDI when one is going from computer application to
hard copy and back," says Steve Young, EDI program manager at Mountain
View, Calif.-based Input, a research company.
      But such value-added services (VAS) can offer you everything from
government requests for quotations (RFQs) servicing to off-site EDI
third-party delivery to document faxing-to-EDI, if you know how to
evaluate the vendor and services you need. 

Finding the Easy Way Out

      Not everyone sees the service bureau concept as a good
alternative to doing it yourself, however.  The question has been
raised whether using service bureaus is even true EDI.
      Input's Young says the paperwork that VAS produce is moving
backward and causes more errors because the human element is
reintroduced to the process.  "The point of true EDI eliminates
errors," he added.       
      But VAS see themselves as filling a niche in the EDI spectrum. 
"Our role is to fill in the blank for small business so they are not
compelled to get EDI or use a value-added network (VAN)," says Ken
Kohler, vice president of sales for Comptech, a VAS in Amarillo,
Texas.  
      Kohler says he is amazed at the number of businesses he comes in
contact with that still don't use a computer.  "These are [thriving]
companies that are doing business with the federal government.  Now
they have to do EDI to win a new contract and where are they going to
go to do that," he says.              
      There are a lot of limitations to EDI regarding the sending of
specifications or design alternatives, Kohler maintains.  VAS, on the
other hand, can enhance a small business's reach beyond EDI by
offering the small-and medium-sized enterprise a multitude of
alternatives, other than just doing EDI with one or two clients, he
says.
      VAS break themselves out into different slots, particularly when
it comes to being a provider of government procurement information. 
Some do very little business with commercial companies, but all do
business with government contractors.  The EDI Connection in Torrance,
Calif., for example, specializes in the retail business.  Cathy
Mueller, its president, says her clients range from those with only a
fax machine to fully-integrated EDI companies that just don't want to
bother with going through the process of mapping transactions over
again.  "We are finding that there are more specialty retailers needing
EDI," Mueller says.            
      The most commonly-used standard for Mueller is X12 for its 850
purchase order, 856 ship notice, 997 functional acknowledgement and
864 message text.  
      Mueller says her company will be expanding its services and has
recently signed a reseller agreement with Datamatix for RFQs. 
Datamatix is a certified VAN with the federal government, located in
Plymouth Meeting, Pa.

Going for the International Market

      Trade Point's specialty is expanding trade opportunities by
giving companies international exposure.
      The Columbus, Ohio-based firm uses the World Wide Web to find
domestic and international markets for its clients.  "We show them how
to use research tools, such as Dun & Bradstreet, Price Waterhouse and
the Journal of Commerce," says Christy Bauer, general counsel for
Trade Point. 
      Cataloging company products is another way that VAS can assist
businesses to expand their exposure and to use EDI in taking and
receiving orders. 
      Neither Infomaze in Dayton, Ohio nor Ali Corp in Diamond Bar,
Calif., provide third-party EDI services to commercial clients. 
Instead, they are strictly government-service providers of RFQs to
contractors. 
      Infomaze has a bulletin board service for the U.S. Defense
Logistics Agency.  The Ohio company began its business providing the
information on paper, graduated to diskette and now provides the data
electronically.  
      Ali Corp. has aligned itself with General Electric Information
Services based in Rockville, Md., to offer its clients a VAN.  
      "Pretty soon, all the VANs will be interconnected and everyone
will be able to access information through a number provided by the
federal government," says Sam Saffari, chief information officer of
Ali Corp. 
      The largest growing segment of the VAS provider is the delivery
of RFQs, according to most VAS.  The delivery system for RFQs that uses
FACNET, the federal government's procurement network, has improved and
more government agencies are on board (EDI NEWS, Oct. 2,).  No one has
firm figures reflecting the increase in RFQ volume, but VAS tell us they
expect the volume to double over the next 12 months. (Christy Bauer,

SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE KEY TO OPEN EDI AND INTERNET USE

      Take a multi-track approach in migrating to open-EDI, industry
experts advise small- and medium-sized businesses.  Make sure your
evolution from traditional EDI involves the personnel and a technical
infrastructure that can support multi-platform programming languages,
such as Java, and advancements in intelligent agent technology, these
experts told EDI NEWS.  
      But don't get ahead of the game, they caution:  Movement to the
UN/EDIFACT standard from X12 won't be coming any time soon.  "You
can't do [EDI] across the Web without human intervention," says Shaw.
      That's the lay of the land painted for us as the new year
unfolded--lots of growth in EDI use is expected in the year ahead,
particularly as enterprises move to the Internet.  "A large number of
small- and medium-sized businesses are excited about EDI," says Jack
Shaw, president of the Atlanta, Ga.-based consultancy, Electronic
Commerce Strategies.  "Within two or three years, we'll see a large
number of [these] businesses using EDI across the Internet and using
open EDI."
      "We see great prospects for doing EDI over the Internet," said
Elizabeth Hudson, director of marketing for Concord, Calif.-based
Premenos Technology Corp.  "Although the Internet is still in its
infancy, we foresee a great acceptance of the Internet in 1996."

New Players

     Shaw sees a lot of new players moving into the market in the next
several months, to join the "old savvy" EDI providers.  He cited
Premenos (see related story, p. 8) and Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling
Software, as two companies that can be expected to take advantage of
how "the Internet will change the way EDI is done." 
     But not everyone is convinced EDI will grow, especially in the
banking industry.  "EDI is dead ... Not only have EDI implementations
flattened, they've trailed off," said Mike Alfonsi, who manages the
treasury consulting practice at Philadelphia-based Core States Bank. 
"We've hit a wall with the cost," he said.  Alfonsi anticipates little
growth in EDI at the current price of implementation.
    A consultant who asked not to be named, suggests "EDI is taking on
another form."  Moving transaction information electronically is
available through procurement card data, lockbox imaging and E-mail,
observes this consultant, who added: "Over the short run, no one is
going to make a lot of money on EDI."
    According to The EDI Group Ltd., based in Oak Park, Ill., EDI and
E-mail will be the fastest growing markets in electronic commerce. 
The firm's report puts the total volume of all business-to-business
transactions at exceeding $45 billion and growing at a compound rate
of six percent a year.
    EDI itself has been gaining in use over the last five years, with
an annual growth rate of 24 percent in the United States since 1990
when 12,000 companies were using EDI.  Today 100,000 companies use
EDI, according to The EDI Group.
    The EDI Group sees EDI growing at more than 20 percent a year and
is taking an increasing share of electronic commerce volume.  The EDI
Group cited the transportation services industry as increasing
electronic commerce expenditures 10.2 percent per year, with EDI and
E-mail accounting for most of the growth.  
    On average, the 15 industries included in The EDI Group's market
forecast are increasing electronic messaging by 8.5 percent.  Other
industries in the study included: Retail, manufacturing, health care
and insurance, government, auto/aerospace, chemical, wholesale,
utilities and financial services. 
    The total business-to-business document volume is projected to
increase from 45.5 billion in 1995 to 58 billion in 1999.  EDI's
growth is undeniable but still only a small portion of the potential
marketplace, analysts say.
    But the real action has been on the Internet where use has grown,
and continues to grow, at a much faster rate than EDI alone.  The
World Wide Web hit the scene in July 1993 with 130 sites.  As of July
1995, there were 38,800 Web sites.  At last count, the number of
existing Web sites was doubling every 48 days, said David L. Taylor,
vice president and research director at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner
Group.
    The EDI community wants to merge the Web's exponential growth with
EDI's utility to forge a ubiquitous electronic commerce solution.  If
EDI vendors can secure the Web to the satisfaction of corporate users,
the two technologies should mean easily available, cost-effective
electronic commerce for businesses of any size, the analysts said.
    "A large number of small- and medium-sized businesses are excited
about EDI," said Shaw.  "Within two or three years, we'll see a large
number of [these] businesses using EDI across the Internet and using
open EDI."
    But EDI's growth will be bolstered only if it becomes more
interactive and more Internet-friendly, industry insiders said at the
Electronic Messaging Association's annual Messaging Solutions Summit
(EDI NEWS, Oct. 30, p. 6).  There's still room, though, for
traditional EDI, says Shaw.  

Internet Security

    The race to secure the Internet for EDI use is changing the way
value-added networks (VANs) are offering services, encouraging use of
open systems, and sparking a firestorm of product development,
industry analysts told EDI NEWS (EDI NEWS, Nov. 27, p. 1).
    Users of the Internet are becoming more comfortable with security
products, and are watching how the federal government and private
enterprises are moving ahead in implementing electronic funds
transfers (EFT), product data and credit card orders secured with data
encryption, and digital authentication products.   "There has been a
lot of hype about the potential for break-ins, but now with recent
[product] developments, the Internet is viable," said Iang Jeon,
senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research.
    Premenos' Templar Certification Program, for example, allows EDI
vendors to incorporate Templar with their translation software to
offer secure Internet EDI.  Internet security companies such as
Premenos and Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security are not the
only companies realizing that Internet security is important -- though
they are out in front.
    Maynard, Mass.-based Digital Equipment Corp.'s Digital's new
Internet Services Roadmap also offers a set of secure Internet
services for users and service providers.  Other security companies
taking advantage of the growing acceptance of the Internet for
sensitive data transmission include Netscape Communications Corp. in
Redwood City, Calif. and VeriSign Inc. in Mountain View, Calif.

0135.)

APL STANDS FIRM IN VISION OF COMPANY AND PRODUCTS

    APL Group Inc.'s strategy for business is to insist on training
potential users on its electronic data interchange (EDI) translation
software products, to be sure they understand just how to use it. 
    Taking control of training has landed APL a profit margin of 67
percent in 1995 sales revenues over 1994 for this year and projections
for 1996 expect to be about the same. 
    "The strategy that has led us to such success is to diversify into
delivering professional services and education along with product
offering," said Stuart Sawabini, president of APL Group.              
    APL takes pride in its ability to provide EDI services to all
levels of users.  "The typical delivery of PC [personal computer]
products to the marketplace come from the Fortune 1000 company.  We
are able to offer strategic level EDI consulting and EDI
implementation services to the HUBs and PC-based solutions to the
supplier," Sawabini said.      
    Big manufacturing companies and government prime contractors have
benefitted from the government's mandate to use EDI for all
procurement processes.  It's the small and medium-sized enterprises
that need more support, Sawabini said. 

A Different Approach

    APL competitor St. Paul Software, based in St. Paul, Minn., designs
and sells translation software, but focuses on multiple platforms
beyond the PC.
    "The final function of what we do is similar, but the majority of
their business is consulting and they [APL] have a translator to go
along with it," said Larry Hastings, vice president of marketing for
St. Paul.
    Hastings said his company focuses mainly on the product and will do
consulting around it.  
    "We just have a different approach--they grew up in the consulting
business and we grew up in systems business," Hastings said.                
    APL client Heavenly Intimates, a manufacturing company in Mt.
Vernon, N.Y., has been using the company's Qualedi translation
software for three years.  "We use it as a front-end for
communications and translation," said Rob Rosenbaum, vice president
for operations.  
    Rosenbaum said he learned of the company at a Kmart suppliers
conference.  "I can process effortlessly 10,000 EDI documents
[transaction] a week," he said.  (Stuart Sawabini, APL Group, 203/762-

FDA TO HOLD JANUARY CONFERENCE ON EDI ADVERSE REPORT FILINGS

    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH) is planning a conference Jan. 25 in
Gaithersburg, Md., to introduce its plans to develop an electronic
data interchange (EDI) system for submission of medical devices
adverse event reports.  The system will be called MEDIC (Medical-Event
Electronic Data Interchange Compact) and will use EDI to automate the
exchange  of "adverse reports"  between the FDA, health device
manufacturers and end-user facilities such as hospitals. 
Manufacturers and hospitals are required by law to file adverse
reports.  The conference will include a forum for industry
representatives to provide input on the MEDIC plan.  (Brenda S. Lucas,

DISA PUBLISHES MODEL EDI AUDIT GUIDE TO TRACK AND VERIFY EDI

    The Legal and Business Controls Work Group of the Accredited
Standards Committee (ASC) X12 of the American National Standards
Institute has developed a "Model EDI Audit Guide."  The guide is
designed to track and verify the trail through which a message is
transmitted from sender to receiver.  It addresses transmission
controls, translating software controls, information security controls
and usage of legal agreements regarding electronic data interchange
(EDI).  The guide provides information for evaluating control issues
that are unique to EDI and is meant to be used as an addendum to
existing application audit programs.  It should prove helpful for EDI
and MIS managers and others who desire a "high-level" understanding of
the objectives and requirements for auditing EDI, the Workgroup said.

PREMENOS CERTIFICATION CAN HELP YOU TO OFFER SECURE INTERNET EDI

    Software translation developers looking for Internet clients now have an
edge by becoming certified vendors of Premenos Corp.'s Templar Certification
program.  Premenos, a subsidiary of Premenos Technology Corp., started its
program recently to allow interested electronic data interchange (EDI) vendors
to incorporate Templar with their translation software, to offer secure 
EDI over 61the Internet.
    With the Templar Certification Program, customers who have implemented
EDI can utilize the Internet as an inexpensive, high-bandwidth form for EDI
communications, says Elizabeth Hudson, director of marketing for Premenos. 
"We see great prospects for doing EDI over the Internet," she explained. 
"Although the Internet is still in its infancy, we foresee a great 
acceptance oftthe Internet in 1996."  Templar is a suite of standards-based 
software, service and network
solutions designed to enable the secure transmission of end-to-end EDI
documents over open networks.  Templar software is the layer between the mail
agent, such as SMTP/MIME, and the EDI translation software to ensure
confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of both origin and
recipe.
    The first companies to participate are personal computer (PC) EDI
translation vendors Wilton, Conn.-based APL Group, DNS Worldwide and TSI
International.  The APL group is a translation software and services company. 
Its soon to be released Qualedi for Windows was the first to be Templar
certified by Premenos as a solution for PC users to send EDI over the Internet. 
DNS Worldwide, which provides electronic commerce software and services for
PC workstations, has integrated its EDI EDGE electronic commerce products
with Templar for Windows.

Internet Opportunities

    Hugh Stewart, DNS president, said that the number of companies that will
be able to conduct EDI over the Internet "will greatly expand by incorporating
our PC EDI translation software with Templar."
    TSI International, the leader in Windows-based software with more than 85
percent market share of that market, will offer Templar as a transport option
for its thousands of Trading Partner PC kits.  Connie Galley, president of TSI,
said that although TSI customers have always been free to make their own
communications choices, Templar gives them a "viable Internet alternative"
backed by a leading company.
    The certification program is available to vendors from UNIX, AS/400 and
MVS mainframe EDI translation software companies.  EDI software companies
can become certified in less than one week.  (Elizabeth Hudson, Premenos,
510/602-2000.)
