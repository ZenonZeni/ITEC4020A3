     The Department's graduate-level offerings, as well as some related
courses, are listed below, together with those who customarily teach them.
All basic and many advanced courses are given every year;  some courses
are taught every other year.  Those courses surrounded by brackets are
taught only when there is sufficient student and faculty interest.  A
variety of advanced undergraduate courses may be taken, under certain
conditions, for graduate credit.  This list is current for the 1994-95
academic year.  <P>

</A> 

<B>Econ 501   Applied Microeconomic Theory</B>.  Cross. 
<P> 
A course designed for students in the MAE program.  Basic models in the
principal areas of microeconomic theory are covered: consumer demand,
production and costs, product markets, factor markets, allocative
efficiency, and corrections for market failure.  Most of the course is
spent studying the use of these tools in the analysis of specific
microeconomic policy problems.  Application of theory to current policy
problems is stressed, and a substantial amount of class time is devoted to
exercises based on such problems.  Prerequisite:  Intermediate
microeconomic theory. 
<P> 

<B>Econ 502   Applied Macroeconomic Theory</B>.  Hymans, Johnson. 
<P> 
A course designed for students in the MAE program.  Approximately
one-third of the course is spent reviewing and elaborating on standard
macro theory of the sort covered in an advanced undergraduate course.  The remainder of the time is spent on applications of this theory to problems of stabilizing aggregate demand, unemployment and inflation, economic growth, and macroeconomics of open e
conomies.  Students will normally do a computer project involving hypothesis testing or model simulation. 
Prerequisite:  Intermediate macroeconomic theory. 
<P>
 
<B>Econ 555   Microeconomics</B>.  Courant, Levinsohn.
<P> 
A course designed for students in the SPP program.  This course begins a
two-term sequence designed to provide students with an understanding of
the economic implications of public policies and with analytic tools
useful in system design and policy planning.  Major topics include
production, costs, prices, resource allocation, governmental involvement
in economic activity, and the operation of market systems.  Prerequisite: 
Permission of instructor.

Topics include models of aggregate supply and business cycles (rational
expectations, new Keynesian, real business cycles, coordination failure
and multiple equilibrium), money supply and demand, investment and
consumption demand and their relationship to financial markets, and fiscal and monetary policy.  the primary emphasis of the course is on
understanding different models, their interrelationship, and empirical
evidence, but new analytic tools are developed and applied as needed.

multivariable calculus, and optimization theory.  Econ 653 is highly
recommended for students taking 601 (653 and 654 are required for Ph.D.
students).  The second semester provides an extended treatment of these
topics, as well as an introduction to differential and difference
equations and convex programming.  Students can place out of either or
both courses by exam.  The pace and content of both courses are strongly
influenced by students' current math needs in other core courses.  There
is a course pack on elementary calculus and matrices which prospective 653
students should read during the summer and an optional 12-hour math review class which begins the day after Labor Day.  Prerequisite:  Familiarity

<B>Econ 668/NR 668   Advanced Natural Resources Economics</B>.  Salant.
<P> 
This course reviews the literature on the pricing of natural resources
(agricultural goods, renewable and nonrenewable resources and durables)
overtime.  The first half of the course considers resources which are
privately owned; the second half considers resources that are common
property.  To provide a point of reference, the behavior of resource
markets in the absence of government intervention is studied first.  There
is then an extensive treatment of the dynamic effects on market equilibria
of widespread government policies (unanticipated, partially anticipated or
fully anticipated).  Policies analyzed include: bufferstocks used to
affect prices (ceilings, floors, bands, and pegs); bans, embargoes, price
controls and whatever else is timely or of interest to participants.  To
simplify the mathematics, discrete-time methods are used predominately. 
The Kuhn-Tucker theorem is utilized when studying competitive equilibrium under certainty.  Dynamic-programming is used to study single-agent (planning or monopoly) problems under uncertainty (with or without learning).  Multi-stage game theory is used to
 investigate dynamic
common-property problems.  A working understanding of these methods is developed during the course.  Prerequisites:  Econ 501 or 601, 653 and 654
or permission of the instructor.

In the presence of pollution externalities, market allocations are
typically inefficient and corrective government regulation may be
desirable.  This course first reviews Pigouvian taxes, pollution permits
and other traditional "remedies" but then points out various real-world
informational, technological, and political constraints which make such
"solutions" infeasible.  The course then focuses on optimal regulatory
policies in the presence of these real world constraints.  Topics
discussed are likely to include 1) optimal regulation when firms possess
more information about compliance costs than regulators; 2) the law and
economics of monitoring and enforcing compliance when monitoring is
costly; 3) collective choice of pollution control strategies (e.g. voting
in pollution control organizations such as the Genossenschaften); 4) the
implementation of systems for trading pollution rights and/or
sophisticated pricing schemes for controlling pollution; and 5) the
inclusion of "stock effects" and other more realistic technological
assumptions into economic models of pollution control. Prerequisites: 
Econ 501 or 601, 653 and 654 or permission of the instructor.
