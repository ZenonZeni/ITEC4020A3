<P ALIGN="RIGHT">September 27, 1996</P>
<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   Unfazed by union recalcitrance, and spurred on
by the 17% unemployment rate, President  Menem is pressing ahead with his labor
reform that severely limits union power and gives employers much more
flexibility in managing the work force.  &#167;  In a victory for the
government, the fiscal package boosting tax revenues became law after quick
senate approval.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;    The sale of federal southeastern railway holdings
to private consortium MRS Logistica opens the way  for the ports to go on the
auction block. And the upcoming privatization of Sao Paulo railway Fepasa will
complement the rail-port efficiencies now in sight.  &#167;  The government is
helping states restructure their debts in return for privatization pledges.  
Page 3</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;   Import duties may be slashed from 11% to 7%
beginning in 1998 as part of a renewed free-trade push.  &#167;  A disagreement
over always-contentious agricultural duties and foreign investment rules has
torpedoed hopes that a Canadian-Chilean trade accord could be signed during
President Frei's October visit to Canada.  &#167;  Hyundai may build a $300
million copper smelter to supply its auto factories.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   Winning a contract dispute with Ecopetrol,
British Petroleum may have opened a Pandora's box  of other foreign oil
companies hoping to convince Colombia to grant them sweeter profit-sharing terms
as well.  &#167;  The government says it wants to quickly revive the moribund
privatization program and sell off some major electricity holdings this year.  &#167;
 In his New York visit, President Samper kept far afield of the controversies
that dog his administration.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>ECUADOR</B>  &#167;   Bucaram's eccentric public spectacles and populist
rhetoric notwithstanding, the flamboyant  president is giving signs of
moderation, with a neoliberal economic plan presented to the IMF and renewed
efforts to attack the budget deficit. His government also seems to be endorsing
privatization and has settled the oil contract row with Maxus.  Page 6</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;   A restive PRI, yearning for its populist roots,
challenged President Zedillo at the party's national  assembly, where the rank
and file tried to stalemate upcoming petrochemical privatizations and limit his
ability to pick another economic reformer to succeed him four years from now.
Their moves strengthen interior minister Emilio Chuayffet, one of the few
cabinet members eligible to run for the presidency.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>PERU  </B> &#167;    President Fujimori's quest for a third term and his
long and increasingly publicized connections with  a military operative are
causing his popularity to sink.  &#167;  Chile will protest to the WTO that
Peruvian plans to develop the southern ports of Ilo and Matarani unfairly
prejudice Chilean trade.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA</B>  &#167;   The Caldera administration faces a true test of
will in management of an oil windfall: how to  put the oil monies to use without
kicking off inflation or an addiction to loose money, as has happened in the
past.  &#167;  A slowdown in cable installations is casting a shadow over the
planned November sale of a 40% stake in telecom monopoly CANTV.  &#167;  Carlos
Andres Perez is back, looking for a new political future.  Page 9</P>
<P><B>PENSION FUND REPORT/BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   Pension funds are seen as
growing five-fold or more over the next  several years from the $66 billion in
assets they hold now. Behind this dramatic prediction is recognition that social
security reform and financial stability are changing the way Brazilian middle
and upper classes save. Meanwhile, the pension funds are already showing their
worth as sources of capital, having taken big equity stakes in several large
corporations.  Page 10</P>

<H1>Populist Theatrics Muddle Promising Signs Of Moderate Policies</H1>
<P>President Abdala Bucaram's populist leanings emerge in his eccentric public
gestures, like a compact disk record ing and the shaving of his moustache in
exchange for a $900,000 donation to a humanitarian foundation. Indica tions from
his first weeks in office, however, are that he could well follow an economic
path more market- friendly than earlier feared. A series of economic targets
have been set, although not yet backed up with detailed policies. Meanwhile the
economy remains stable, some of the problems that surged in the oil sector have
been settled and privatization appears to be going forward.</P>
<P><B>Economy A La Cavallo.</B> An economic plan inspired by former Argentine
economy minister Domingo Cavallo aims to create 600,000 jobs in four years and
bring two million Ecuadorans above the poverty level by the year 2001, double
average per-capita income to $3,200 in ten years and boost economic growth to 6%
annually within two years. The plan, which the government presented to the IMF
September 24, has met with the approval of business but not of labor, the left
or indigenous groups.</P>
<P>Bucaram's economic appointments have helped maintain confidence. Alvaro
Noboa as chief of the monetary board, David Goldbaum as top man at the national
finance corporation, and Roberto Isaias as chief of the presidential economic
commission (LL 7/19/96) remain market-pleasing appointments. Worries linger,
however, over whether rivalries between the Noboa and Isaias business groups
will cause strain within the team. It is also unclear how much influence central
bank president Augusto de la Torre, a respected holdover from the Duran-Ballen
government, continues to have. </P>
<P><B>Indicators Stay Positive.</B> So far, at least, efforts to portray a
rational economic front have smoothed out economic indicators. Since Bucaram
took office Aug. 10, interest rates have fallen, the dollar has remained stable
and international monetary reserves have risen from $1.45 billion in August to
over $1.6 billion now. Labor and business have taken the first steps toward a
social pact. Still, the country is in recession and 1996 inflation is expected
to hit 27%, above the 21% target.</P>
<P><B>Oil Reform.</B> The August brouhaha over Maxus oil operations has died
down. After the government prohibited Maxus exports and threatened to send the
military into the YPF subsidiary's oil fields, Maxus agreed to negotiate a new
contract. About to be signed, the new accord would give the state a 29% share of
Maxus crude production. Other oil multinationals (Arco, Occidental Orix, Elf
Aquitaine and Tripetrol) have also quietly agreed to renegotiate their deals.
</P>
<P>State oil company Petroecuador, is also about to undergo an overhaul.
Operations will be re-centralized. Energy and mines minister Alfredo Adum has
also announced the planned construction of a new pipeline for heavy crudes, with
public international bidding possible for the contract. </P>
<P>But Adum ran into trouble trying to end gas subsidies, which would have
raised $160 million but returned $40 million to Ecuador's poor via a Christmas
bonus. When it became clear the bonus would be logistically unfeasible, Bucaram
scotched the whole plan.</P>
<P><B>Privatizations Revived.</B> Privatizations planned by the National
Modernization Council (CONAM) are re putedly still on track despite initial
worries that Bucaram would slow them. Operation of Ecuador's four main harbors
will be transferred to the private sector, with international bidding expected
by year-end for Guayaquil, early 1997 for Puerto Bolivar and Manta, and later
for Esmeraldas. The country's main roads will be turned over to the private
sector via concessions averaging 15 years. The privatization of telephone
utility Emetel is expected by April 1997.</P>
<P><B>Bolivia Model For Power?</B> But signs of trouble are evident in the
energy sector. Energy minister Adum has pushed for the sale of 39% of the
national electricity institute to private investors. Bucaram signed the new law,
but less than a week later announced he would make the reform more like a
Bolivia-style &quot;capitaliza tion&quot; in which privatization is accomplished
by bringing in more capital rather than selling an existing stake.</P>
<P><B>No Nonsense. </B>Bucaram has let some of his populist campaign stances
slide. Though he had promised to make one of his first tasks as president
dismantling a controversial decree allowing monthly fuel price hikes, Bucaram
let the measure stand. He dedicated just 19% of the budget to education though
he promised 30%. In late September, Bucaram will inaugurate the first phase of a
construction plan, some 13,000 houses near Guayaquil, but has not yet guaranteed
government financing for the other 187,000 planned.  </P>
<P>The president has also taken measures to attack a budget deficit estimated
at 2-4% of GDP. A tax compliance program is now in place, with several firms
closed for evasion and 250 more on a blacklist. Many import duty exemptions will
be suspended. </P>
<P>The wild card remains of how the country will settle in to the &quot;junk
news&quot; style of an unpredictable president who brags about his music video
and compact disk, who has insulted everyone from former presidents to &quot;union
mafias,&quot; &quot;lazy congressmen,&quot; and &quot;corrupted indigenous
leaders.&quot; If he sticks to theatrics on trivial points and leaves economic
policy to capable advisers, business' worst fears will not be realized.</P>
