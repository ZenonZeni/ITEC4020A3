Netscape and Sun Release JavaScript

Netscape Communications Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc.
have released JavaScript, an open, cross-platform object
scripting language for the creation and customization of
applications on enterprise networks and the Internet.  A
complement to Java -- Sun's object-oriented, cross-platform
programming language -- JavaScript is available in its initial
form as part of the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0, which
may be downloaded from Netscape's Web site.

The draft specification of JavaScript, as well as the final draft
specification of Java, will be published and submitted to
appropriate standards bodies for industry review and comment this
month.  Netscape and Sun plan to propose JavaScript to the W3
Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
as an open Internet scripting language standard.

Twenty-eight companies -- America Online Inc., Apple Computer
Inc., Architext Software, Attachmate Corporation, AT&T, Borland
International, Brio Technology Inc., Computer Associates Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett- Packard Company, Iconovex
Corporation, Illustra Information Technologies Inc., Informix
Software Inc., Intuit Inc., Macromedia, Metrowerks Inc., Novell
Inc., Oracle Corporation, Paper Software Inc., Precept Software
Inc., RAD Technologies Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.,
Silicon Graphics Inc., Spider Technologies, Sybase Inc., Toshiba
Corporation, Verity Inc., and Vermeer Technologies Inc.  -- have
agreed to adopt JavaScript as an open standard object scripting
language and have stated their intentions to provide it in future
products.

Complementary to and integrated with both Java and HTML,
JavaScript is designed specifically for the Internet and network-
centric applications.  It is designed to be used by people with
little or no programming experience to quickly construct complex
applications.  While Java is used by programmers to create new
objects and applets, JavaScript is designed to allow HTML page
authors and enterprise application developers to create live
online applications that link objects and resources on both
clients and servers.

Java "was designed from the ground up for the Internet," said
Bill Joy (vice president of research, Sun).  "JavaScript is a
natural fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and
Unicode-based worldwide use.  JavaScript will be the most
effective method to connect HTML-based content to Java applets."

Netscape will support Java and JavaScript in client and server
products, as well as in programming tools and applications.  The
company is building Java and JavaScript support into all Netscape
products to provide a unified, front-to-back, client/server/tool
environment for building and deploying live online applications.
Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit
JavaScript scripts; Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs
to be installed, run, and managed on Netscape servers; and
Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for JavaScript connectivity to
high-performance relational data bases from Illustra, Informix,
Microsoft, Oracle, and Sybase.

Java, the Java Compiler, and the Java Developer's Kit, as well as
the HotJava browser and related documentation are available free
of charge from Sun's Web site at http://java.sun.com.  In
addition, the Java source code can be licensed for a fee.
Existing Sun Java licensees will receive a license to JavaScript.
Moreover, Sun and Netscape intend to make a source code reference
implementation of JavaScript available for royalty-free
licensing, further encouraging its adoption as a standard in a
wide variety of products.

To date, Sun has licensed Java to a number of companies,
including IBM Corporation, Borland, Macromedia, Mitsubishi,
Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Spyglass, Toshiba, and Microsoft
Corporation (see related story ).

IBM plans to implement the Java technology in products such as
Web browsers and Web servers.  In addition, IBM intends to port
the Java technology to its OS/2 and AIX operating systems, as
well as Microsoft's Windows 3.1.  IBM will make those ports
available over the World Wide Web so users can begin to work with
Java on these platforms starting in the first quarter of 1996
(Sun, 2550 Garcia Avenue, Mountain View CA 94043-1100, 415/336-
5337; Netscape, 501 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View CA
94014, 415/254-1900, fax 415/528-4124).

Microsoft Reveals Internet Strategy, Jumps on Java Bandwagon

7 December -- At a day-long press briefing in Seattle,
Washington, Microsoft Corporation outlined a broad set of
Internet strategies and products designed to propel the software
giant to the forefront of the exploding Internet industry.  In
the most dramatic announcement of the day, Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates not only endorsed Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java
programming language, but revealed that Microsoft has licensed
the rival technology for use in its operating systems, software
programs, and Internet tools.

Acknowledging the "importance of embracing the industry's love of
Java," Microsoft's Internet strategy involves a shift away from
proprietary standards and a nod toward the overwhelming support
of Java as an emerging Internet standard.  A report in The Wall
Street Journal called Microsoft's move a "key gesture, since Java
had become a rallying cry for Internet competitors aligned
against [Microsoft]."  The Java licensing deal was reached just
ten hours before the Microsoft press briefing was scheduled to
begin.

Microsoft said it plans to include the technology in its Internet
Explorer browser, to be offered in 1996 as part of a free add-on
product for users of the Windows 95 and Windows NT operating
systems.  Under the licensing agreement with Sun Microsystems,
Microsoft will make sure that Java works well with its two
operating systems and then will submit the altered code to Sun.
At that point, either Sun or Microsoft may license the Java code
to third parties.

In addition to the Java announcement, Gates also said that
Microsoft will accelerate its repositioning of the Microsoft
Network (MSN) subscription service as an Internet gateway --
offering much of its content free of charge over the Internet or
at a discount to MSN members.

Gates also discussed Microsoft's new interactive 3D multimedia
animation technology for the Internet, ActiveVRML.  Optimized for
authoring and playback on personal computers, ActiveVRML allows
content authors to create three dimensional effects on Web pages.
The technology is being offered as an open industry specification
and has been submitted as a proposal to VRML industry working
groups.

In addition, the company has signed a host of cross-agreements
with companies that include Computer Associates, Oracle, and
Spyglass.  The Microsoft-Spyglass deal calls for Spyglass to
enhance its popular Web browser Mosaic with support for OLE
(object linking and embedding) Controls, Visual Basic Script, and
the latest HTML extensions.  It also will include support for
several new Microsoft server technologies.

Also making its debut at the press briefing was Visual Basic
Script, an Internet scripting language Microsoft will offer over
the Internet at no cost.  The OLE-based Visual Basic Script will
allow developers to link and automate elements among Web pages --
not unlike what may be accomplished with Java and the
complementary JavaScript languages (Microsoft, One Microsoft Way,
Redmond WA 98052, 206/882-8080).

Online Christmas

By ROCKLEY L. MILLER
EDITOR AND PUBLISHER

The early results are in, and it seems to have been an "Online
Christmas."  While many retailers reported weak sales in most
gift categories, multimedia computers and high-speed modems were
on a roll, with Dataquest projecting a 46 percent increase in
1995 modem sales to 17.8 million units and IntelliQuest claiming
that nearly 90 percent of new computers are being sold with
installed modems -- up from 70 percent last year.  Also selling
big were books having anything to do with the Internet and
software for getting connected.

The pace of people moving online is matched by the migration of
multimedia capability to the World Wide Web.  New browsers and
home page development tools abound.  The Hot Java programming
language from Sun Microsystems allows programmers to create small
cross-platform applications or "applets" that can include
multimedia and interactive elements, can be transported easily
over the Internet, and can be swapped in and out of user's
computers on an as needed basis.  These specialized self-
contained programs gain value from their small size and targeted,
purpose-specific functionality and ability to interact with other
Java-based programs to perform intelligent tasks such as updating
personalized stock prices or weather reports.

The Java language is being embraced by many of the major Internet
players including Netscape and Microsoft and will allow anyone to
create and upload Java applets as building blocks for others to
use in assembling larger Java applications.

Low-cost hardware devices for Internet access are about to arrive
from Philips (as a CD-i variation) and from Bandai (in the newly
configured Pippin, based on Apple's Power PC chip and operating
system).  Right on their heels are IBM and Oracle, each promising
to develop powerful $500 network terminals that will provide
dedicated communications capabilities and run Java-style software
applets.

For most users, however, the online experience remains a
frustrating series of "clicks and waits" as large graphic files
load slowly via even the fastest 28.8 Kbps conventional modems --
taking more than a minute for a simple two megabit image.  Even
those who step up to ISDN 58 Kbps service will be twiddling their
thumbs for over 30 seconds.  Start downloading video and
animations, and the wait can easily become hours or days.

Thus, I predict that the "giant sucking sound" we hear in 1996,
won't be Ross Perot's jobs heading south of the border, but
consumers sucking up high-speed cable modems as fast as the cable
companies can process the orders.  Offering 4 Mbps data rates, a
cable modem will pop that same two megabit image up on your
screen in half a second.  Large file transfers become viable, as
minutes become seconds and hours become barely minutes.  Cable
companies already have ordered more than 500,000 of the devices
for distribution beginning in early 1996.  Given the patience
level of the typical American consumer, and given a competitively
low monthly cost for both modem leasing and service access, these
devices promise to totally transform the online landscape in the
coming new year.  q

Note:  This is not a joke.  In the Christmas rush, we received an
interesting letter, dated 30 December, from Keith Barland at the
Microsoft corporate library.  It seems that Microsoft has
developed a whole new perspective on copyright protection and
site licensing that might contain good news for users of its
software.

The letter humbly requests permission to reproduce articles from
Multimedia Monitor "obtained from any source and in any format,
whether print or electronic, for distribution solely to employees
of Microsoft for internal use only."  This permission was to be
granted without additional payment and without any other
limitations.  The clincher was the last sentence, which read, "If
we do not hear from you we will assume your approval of this
agreement."

Might I humbly suggest that we all issue similar requests to
Microsoft for permission to reproduce its software for internal
use only, without additional payment or any other limitations.
Of course, should Microsoft fail to specifically and directly
deny such a request -- or should their denial become conveniently
lost in the mail -- we can all presume they have approved our
request, and we can save a bundle on corporate-wide software
purchases and site licenses.

Get real, Microsoft.  The request alone is arrogant enough, but
the presumption of a default loss of rights is beyond the pale --
and this from the company that hopes to pave most of the
information highway.  Are information providers like us mere road
kill in the Microsoft vision? Or is Microsoft somehow exempt from
the intellectual property rules that they expect everyone else to
respect?

Microsoft and NBC Enter Cable Television, Online Deal

After weeks of speculation, Microsoft Corporation and NBC have
entered into a joint venture to form MSNBC Cable, a 24-hour cable
television news channel, and MSNBC Online, a complementary
interactive online service.  Under the terms of the agreement,
totaling approximately $420 million, Microsoft will invest $220
million over the next five years for a 50 percent stake in the
cable network.  In addition, NBC will put up $200 million over
five years for its part in funding the cable channel and the
supporting online service.

MSNBC Cable will feature NBC News correspondents, live coverage
of world events, news analysis, and "a multimedia presence on-
screen."  According to Bob Wright (president of NBC), the new
cable service will be launched in late 1996.  Wright said he
expects the new cable service to have between 25-35 million
viewers by the end of 1996, compared to CNN's 67 million viewers.
The MSNBC Online service, accessible through the Microsoft
Network, will leverage content available globally from NBC and
sister service CNBC.  According both parties, NBC will handle all
news gathering for the joint venture, as well as for the
Microsoft Network online service.

Executives with both companies expect that the three services --
NBC News, MSNBC Cable, and MSNBC Online -- will work in concert
to strengthen the other's position through cross-promotion.
Furthermore, the new cable service will extend its reach
internationally through NBC's ownership and interest in NBC Super
Channel in Europe, CNBC in Asia, CNBC in Europe, Canal de
Noticias NBC in Latin America, and the soon-to-be-launched NBC
Asia (Microsoft, One Microsoft Way, Redmond WA 98052, 206/882-

IMA and Blockbuster Both To Release CD-ROM Matching Software

The Interactive Multimedia Association and Blockbuster Video
Corporation separately have released CD-ROM matching software to
aid consumers in pairing CD-ROM software titles with their
personal computer systems.

For its part, the Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA) has
released the beta version of its CD Match software.  The CD Match
initiative (Monitor 12/95 p7) is an industry-wide campaign to
help consumers better match CD-ROM software titles with their
personal computing systems.  The software runs on a variety of
platforms and creates a printout of a system's capabilities.
Consumers can then take this printout to a local retail outlet
and compare it to the IMA-recommended "Uniform Label" that will
appear on CD-ROM packages to determine if their computer system
will support a particular title's system requirements.  The CD-
Match package labels will not be seen in high quantities until
late second quarter 1996.

The beta version of the CD Match software is available on the
IMA's World Wide Web site (ftp://ftp.ima.org/pub/cdmatch) and
also through Horizons Technology Inc.'s Web site
(http://www.horizons.com/cdmatch).  According to Ken Christie
(vice president of marketing at the IMA), "Getting the various
individual companies in both hardware and software publishing to
agree was not difficult.  The industry had seen a need for CD
Match and the IMA has a working relationship with Software
Publishers Association (SPA) to ensure that the systems
requirement portions are in sync.  SPA is doing a similar thing,
so they are in support of uniform labeling, as we are in support
of uniform packaging."

Meanwhile, Blockbuster Video Corporation, in conjunction with
Windows utility software publisher Touchstone Software
Corporation, rolled out the Blockbuster PC MatchMaker on 4
December 1995 into eight markets.  This utility lists all the CD-
ROM titles available at the retailer and indicates which titles
are compatible with a shopper's computer.  The floppy disk will
sell for $9.99, but will be free to consumers who buy and rent
CD-ROMs at Blockbuster (IMA, Suite 202, 48 Maryland Avenue,
Annapolis MD 21401-8011, 410/626-1380; Blockbuster, PO Box
407060, Ft.  Lauderdale FL 33340-7060, 305/832-3000).

Intuit Plans Internet Banking Service, Skirts Deal with AOL

Despite signing a strategic agreement with America Online Inc.
just last month to jointly provide electronic banking services to
AOL customers (Monitor 12/95 p5), Intuit Inc.  has announced
plans to introduce an independent Internet-based home banking
service.  The new service will be available to customers by the
second half of 1996.  According to Intuit, customers will be able
to download free software via the Internet to establish a "home
banking link" that will work essentially the same way the
AOL/Intuit banking service will work -- but at no charge to the
user.

Currently, Intuit offers users of its popular Quicken personal
finance software the option to bank online via the company's
private network.  With the new Internet service, customers will
be able to bank online without being required to own Quicken.
Customers will be able to monitor bank accounts, transfer funds
between accounts, and pay bills via the Internet -- with all
transactions protected by an encryption process.  Intuit will
receive a fee from the participating bank for each transaction.

Jones Launches The Internet Channel in Virginia

Jones International Ltd.  has launched The Internet Channel, a
high-speed Internet gateway service now available to Alexandria,
Virginia cable TV customers who are served by Jones Intercable (a
subsidiary of Jones International).  Through a cable modem
connected to a home PC, customers may access The Internet Channel
to explore a virtual "Old Town" Alexandria, where storefronts
symbolize Internet destinations -- as well as local, regional,
and global merchants.

For example, users can click on a movie theater marquee to access
local showing information and hyperlink to the home pages for
each featured movie title.  Other destinations include:  a
Newsstand that connects users to cover pages of magazines and a
City Hall building that links users to municipal information.
Because cable modems can provide connections that are as much as
100 times faster than telephone modems, "the Internet Channel
will allow its subscribers unlimited usage of the service for a
fixed rate of about a dollar per day," according to Bill Nestel
(president, The Internet Channel).

The Internet Channel, which will operate as a sister company of
Jones International, has entered into an arrangement with LANcity
Corporation, which will supply the cable modems that will be used
in Alexandria.  Eventually, The Internet Channel plans to license
its gateway services to other cable TV systems, in addition to
those operated by Jones (9697 East Mineral Avenue, PO Box 3309,
Englewood CO 80155-3309, 303/792-3111, fax 303/792-5608).

3DO Signs Definitive Agreement with Matsushita, Buys Cyclone
Studios

Six weeks after announcing plans to license its M2 technology to
Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, The 3DO Company has
signed a definitive agreement effecting the $100 million deal
(Monitor 12/95 p5).  Under the agreement, signed on 7 December
1995, Matsushita will pay 3DO a $100 million license fee plus
additional royalties.  3DO will receive $60 million in mid-
December and the remaining $40 million by the middle of 1996.

The agreement gives Matsushita exclusive rights to use the M2
technology to power next-generation consumer and commercial
products (including DVD, set-top boxes, and 64-bit games
machines).  Matsushita also may sub-license the M2 technology to
hardware companies and software developers.  3DO has the rights
to develop products based on the M2 technology for coin-operated
arcade game systems, personal computer applications, general
computing, and software development tools.

Trip Hawkins (CEO, The 3DO Company) said 3DO will use the funds
to diversify.  "We will exploit our core technology to enter the
PC market with software and hardware, the Internet arena, as well
as the 64-bit video game market," he said.

As a part of its diversification efforts, 3DO has entered into an
agreement to acquire the assets of Cyclone Studios, a company
devoted to developing action/arcade-style video games.  The
acquisition is intended to bolster Studio 3DO's ability to
deliver titles on advanced 32-bit, 64-bit, and PC platforms.  3DO
will acquire the assets of Cyclone Studios for a combination of
cash, common stock, and other considerations.  Terms of the
agreement were not disclosed.  Cyclone Studios will operate as an
independent division within Studio 3DO (3DO, 600 Galveston Drive,
Redwood City CA 94063-4746, 415/261-2792; Matsushita, 1006

Group of Nine Agree On DVD Format Name and Specifications

The core group of nine digital videodisc (DVD) development
companies -- Sony Corporation, Philips Electronics NV, Toshiba
Corporation, Time Warner Inc., Matsushita Electrical Industrial
Company, Pioneer Electronic Corporation, JVC, Hitachi Ltd., and
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (reportedly, Thomson Multimedia
of France will become the tenth member of the group) -- have
formally adopted "Digital Versatile Disc," or "DVD" for short, as
the official name of forthcoming high-density CD format.

The group also reached an agreement on the basic technical
specifications for DVD hardware media.  The discs will be 120 mm,
or five inches, in diameter and 1.2 mm thick with 4.7 GB of
memory per side (allowing 133 minutes of video per side).  The
format also will be backwards compatible with existing compact
disc technology, meaning that it will run current CD music discs,
as well as CD-ROM storage and game discs.

For video storage, MPEG-2 (Motion Picture Experts Group type 2)
video compression will be the standard.  For audio, Dolby AC-3
will be used.  The discs will be able to carry a maximum of eight
sound channels and 32 subtitle data channels alongside each
movie.  For computer data storage applications, the group agreed
to use the Micro UDF or ISO-9660 file management structure.
Specifications for music applications will be completed after the
group hears opinions from music industry representatives.

The group reported that the first DVD players are expected to go
on sale in late 1996 or early 1997 and are expected to retail in
the $500 to $600 range.  These early machines will not be able to
record until copyright issues are resolved.

In related news, Toshiba Corporation proposed to the companies
involved in the DVD development that a joint company be
established to centralize management of royalty contracts and
revenues.  The purpose of the joint company will be to avoid any
doubling of royalty charges or unnecessary increases in license
fees for users of the technologies.  Sources within Toshiba
report that a company will be established by the end of January
(Sony, 9 West 57th Street, New York NY 10019, 212/371-5800;

Pioneer Drops LaserActive

Pioneer Consumer Electronics is quietly closing out its
LaserActive interactive videodisc system, with players now
selling for around $299.  According to David McCollough (AV brand
manager at Pioneer), the company intends to sell through its
remaining LaserActive inventory by early 1996.  A Sega module
will be packaged with each player.  The LaserActive system --
which combines a videodisc/CD combi-player with optional control
packs developed in cooperation with Sega and NEC -- was launched
in 1993 in an attempt to appeal to the upscale interactive
entertainment consumer.

McCollough said, "In the game industry, a lot of people make the
money on the software, not on the hardware.  We were trying to
making some profit on the hardware side, as well as the software
side, which is not how that industry is structured."  He added
that, "LaserActive suffered from software developers' reluctance
to invest in authoring tools needed to create games for the
system."  According to McCollough, Pioneer is still dedicated to
the videodisc format.  Current plans for the company call for a
shift in focus towards the entertainment and home theater aspect
of videodisc by adding such features to standard videodisc
players (Pioneer, 600 East Crescent Avenue, Upper Saddle River NJ
07450, 201/327-6400).

Quark Brings Desktop Publishing Online

Envisioning a leap into the next generation of online publishing,
Quark Inc.  has developed QuarkImmedia -- a multimedia software
program that will allow users of the company's popular
QuarkXPress desktop publishing system to package material for the
Internet and the World Wide Web.

QuarkImmedia consists of two components -- an authoring tool,
which builds on QuarkXPress, and a viewer.  The viewer will be
available for downloading, free of charge, via the Internet once
QuarkImmedia is released in the first half of 1996.  Prior to its
final release, QuarkImmedia will be distributed to 300 customers
at Quark's Vail customer conference (12-15 December) for the
purpose of "test driving" the program.  Feedback from the test
group will help determine the look and feel of the final product
(Quark, 1800 Grant Street, Denver CO 80203, 303/894-8888).

SoftKey Works Deal with Tribune, Woos TLC Away from Broderbund

On 30 November, SoftKey International Inc.  entered into a
definitive agreement with Tribune Company to purchase two Tribune
subsidiaries -- Compton's NewMedia Inc.  and Compton's Learning
Company -- in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $106.5
million.  SoftKey also has agreed to assume up to $17 million of
intercompany debt in connection with the acquisition.

"By combining Compton's NewMedia with SoftKey, we can reach
millions of new homes that were previously untapped.  We view the
SoftKey investment as a part of our commitment to the future of
the consumer marketing business," said Robert Bosau (executive
vice president, Tribune New Media/Education).

In a related deal, Tribune Company agreed to make a $150 million
strategic investment in SoftKey in the event that SoftKey
acquires a majority of the common stock of The Learning Company
(TLC).  Tribune's investment would be in the form of 5.50 percent
convertible/exchangeable notes from SoftKey (due in the year
2000).  The notes will be convertible into SoftKey common stock
at a conversion price of $53 per share.

Within a week, TLC signed a definitive merger agreement with
SoftKey International Inc., terminating its earlier merger
agreement with Broderbund Software Inc.  (Monitor 9/95 p12).
Under the terms of the 7 December agreement, SoftKey's wholly-
owned subsidiary, Kidsco Inc., will offer to purchase
approximately 8.28 million shares of TLC for $67.50 per share in
cash.  These shares represent all TLC shares outstanding,
including vested stock options, as of 6 December 1995.
Approximately 1.1 million unvested TLC options will be converted
into SoftKey options, a transaction valued at about $606 million.

Commenting on his company's decision to terminate its Broderbund
merger agreement and to pursue the SoftKey deal, Bill Dinsmore
(president and CEO, The Learning Company) said, "Our board of
directors unanimously concluded that the revised SoftKey merger
terms are clearly in the best interests of the... stockholders."

Broderbund -- which had filed a lawsuit against SoftKey alleging
"questionable business and accounting practices" -- has agreed to
withdraw all litigation related to TLC, SoftKey, and Tribune
Company (SoftKey, 1 Athenaeum Street, Cambridge MA 02142,

DataMark Media, Katz Offer Free Online Shopping Service

Direct marketing services firm DataMark Systems Inc.  and Katz
Media Group have unveiled plans for an advertiser-supported
online direct marketing service called ValuOne Online.

The free service -- designed to drive purchase decisions in
retail and catalog channels -- helps consumers easily find and
select information about a broad range of products and services.
ValuOne Online offers consumers the ability to preview products
and promotions before making a purchase; gives them a direct
connection to catalog marketers; and includes a "coupon clipping"
feature that gives lets users print out coupons for their
favorite products for redemption at their local supermarket.

"ValuOne Online takes advantage of how consumers really prefer to
use online services:  as a resource before buying rather than as
a place to actually make purchases," said Chad Evans (chief
executive officer of DataMark Systems).  Evans noted that
according to a recent Advertising Age study, 60 percent of
respondents said they were interested in interactive services
that allow them to research products before purchasing.

DataMark Systems used a proprietary consumer profiling technology
to "hand-pick" four million online consumers who will be the
first to experience ValuOne Online.  DataMark Systems will
distribute ValuOne Online diskettes to these qualified users.
The service is scheduled to launch in the first half of 1996.

Katz Media Group will sell advertising space on the service.
Advertisers can display or promote products through a number of
advertising options, including Power Display "prime" display
space; Prime Marquees; Sponsor Marquees; time-sensitive
promotions for limited time opportunities,; and coupons for users
to view and print for redemption.  In addition, ValuOne Online's
Admaker function allows marketers 24-hour access to their ads, so
they can change any part of their promotional offer almost
instantaneously (DataMark Media, Suite 220, 348 East Winchester,
Salt Lake City UT 84107, 801/268-2202).

HomeArts Launches Breast Heath Center on WWW

HomeArts, a division of Hearst New Media & Technology, has

(http://homearts.com/depts/health/00breaf1.htm), a World Wide Web
site that offers broad coverage of breast cancer and breast
health awareness issues.  The site also contains a forum for
those affected by breast cancer to share support and information.
According to HomeArts, online access to this type of information
has been compromised in recent days by some commercial services
that censor content containing the word "breast," thereby
preventing subscribers from participating in breast cancer
survivors' bulletin boards and other services (HNM, 3rd Floor, 4

Dimension X Offers Web Users a "Liquid Reality"

Dimension X has released Liquid Reality, which fully integrates
the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) into a Java-based
browser to transform static VRML objects into realistic
characters with lifelike responses and behaviors using motion and
audio.

According to Dimension X CEO Karl Jacob, Liquid Reality turns
existing three-dimensional VRML sites into "interactive Web
movies.  Right now, VRML worlds are lifeless and static places.
Liquid Reality enables us to create environments which mimic the
world around us, full of motion, sound, and interaction," he
said.

Liquid Reality lets users customize VRML Web sites that can then
be viewed and shared by other Liquid Reality users.  A Web site
can be developed to automatically trigger responses based on the
location of the user within the site, or they can be developed so
that the users must select objects to activate the responses.

Kodak Unveils Photo CD Technology for World Wide Web

Eastman Kodak Company and the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) have released a technology that allows World
Wide Web users to zoom in and examine small details of Photo CD
images transmitted over the Internet.  To experience the
technology firsthand, online users may access the NCSA Web site
(http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/HomePage.html)
and download special Photo CD-Aware NCSA Mosaic 2.1 for Windows
software.  Web users can, for example, zoom in and read tail
numbers of historic planes featured on the Smithsonian's National
Air and Space Museum Web site.

The current enabling technology is available to users of NCSA's
Mosaic browser software on the Windows 3.1, Windows for
WorkGroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT platforms.  To discourage
unauthorized use of copyrighted images, Kodak also is developing
technology that will limit access to higher-resolution Photo CD
data and which will allow providers to watermark their images
with identifying words or graphics (Kodak, 343 State Street,
Rochester NY 14650, 716/724-4000).

OSTA Establishes Interchange Standard

The Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA), a trade
association representing optical product manufacturers, has
established the Universal Disk Format (UDF), a single-file system
interchange standard for computer applications.

The UDF, developed by OSTA to make optical storage solutions
independent of the data or operating system, will work with the
International Standards Organization interchange standard for
non-sequential recording of data, called ISO 13346.  The aim of
the UDF "is to facilitate data interchange independent of
hardware, software, and operating system," said Isaac van Kempen,
senior product line manager at Fujitsu America Inc.  and chairman
of the OSTA Technical Committee.

OSTA said it will develop a new specification based on its UDF
that will provide a standard file system for digital videodisc
(DVD) to ensure playback compatibility between DVD players and
computer-based systems supporting the OSTA compliant portion of
the ISO 13346 file system.

According to a report in the Electronic Buyers' News, the
specification to be developed will extend data interchange to
include the consumer environment, will separate hardware from
content, and will create compatible file systems for both
entertainment and computer-based content.  The UDF format will
then support read-only, write once, and rewritable applications,
as well as combinations of those applications.

Philips Develops CD-R and Erasable Chip for SCSI and ATAPI
Interfaces

Philips Semiconductors has developed a highly integrated CD-R/E
chip with a choice of external SCSI or ATAPI interfaces.  The
SAA7390 also condenses sophisticated functions from four
integrated circuits (ICs) into one to reduce both board area and
costs.

The SAA7390 contains all of the logic required to connect
decoders to a host.  The IC is capable of 6X read and 4X write
with a maximum burst data transfer rate of 16.9 MB per second
into the external interface IC.  The SAA7390 includes third level
error encoding and decoding in hardware and an easy-to-use memory
management system with ten levels of arbitration.  Philips offers
the chip with a choice of SCSI or ATAPI interface capability with
high level of integration.

The SAA7390 chip will cost $25 per 10,000-piece quantity and will
be available in January 1996.  In early 1996, CD-ROM developers
will be able to purchase total systems software from Philips
Semiconductors that will be fully tested for compatibility and
functionality.  The total systems packages are expected to reduce
the drive development time by about eight months (811 East Arques
Avenue, PO Box 3409, Sunnyvale CA 94088-3409, 408/991-2000).

Speech Systems Unveils PCMCIA-Based Speech Recognition System

Speech Systems Inc.  has unveiled the Phonetic Engine 1000
(PE1000), a PCMCIA card that enables mobile, Windows-based
computers to run speech-driven applications using Speech Systems'
continuous speech, speaker-independent speech recognition
technology.

Based on a Multimedia PC Card from DSP Solutions Inc., the PE1000
is a Type II Extended PC card that integrates a Texas Instruments
TMS320C50 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for highly accurate
speech recognition in real-time.  The PE1000 PC Card receives
incoming speech through a microphone, and the DSP converts it to
speaker-independent phonetic codes that are used for recognizing
speech.  The PE1000 card features two jacks for speech
recognition -- one for voice input, the other for audio output --
allowing card to serve as a single source for sound and CD-ROM
playback.

Speech Systems also plans to offer an OEM version of the PE1000
PC Card, which can be embedded in mobile data terminals such as
belt units or hand-held computing devices with the ability to
process speech input and send it to a host computer.

Scheduled to begin shipping in the fourth quarter of 1995, the
PE1000 will be available as a Run-time System (RTS) that includes
the PE1000 PC Card, RTS software, and a noise-canceling
microphone ($595).  Speech Systems' VoiceMatch SDK software is
$595.  A bundled development system that includes a PE1000 RTS
and VoiceMatch is available for $995.  SpeechWizard software,
also for use with the RTS, is an additional $295 (Speech Systems,
2945 Center Green Court South, Boulder CO 80301-2275, 303/938-

IMA Joins in Launch of EC-Funded Intellectual Property Consortium

The Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA) has joined in the
launch of IMPRIMATUR, an international consortium funded by the
European Commission (EC) and announced at the European
Information Technology Conference in Brussels on 29 November.
The goal of IMPRIMATUR is to develop international consensus on
practices for managing intellectual property to support
"electronic commerce for content" -- making intellectual property
accessible, yet secure.  While a number of proprietary solutions
exist for such information management, there are as yet no
agreed-on specifications that allow different systems to
interoperate.

IMPRIMATUR's 15 members include ALCS, Bertelsmann AG, the British
Library, CISAC, CliPet Communications, Digicash, EUSIDIC,
Florence University, IFPI, ILC Ltd, Imperial College, Teles GmbH,
Telia AB, Thomson Multimedia, and, now, the Interactive
Multimedia Association.  The Authors Licensing and Collecting
Society (ALCS) in the United Kingdom is the coordinator of the
Consortium.

Unlike other members of the consortium, the IMA will not receive
funding from the European Commission.  Instead, the IMA will
commit itself to providing a link between the other members of
IMPRIMATUR and US industry (IMA, Evan Shubin, Suite 202, 48

Pac Bell Moves Into Wireless TV

Pacific Bell plans to acquire, for approximately $175 million,
all of the stock of Wireless Holdings Inc.  (WHI) and Videotron
Bay Area Inc.  (VBAI) -- giving Pacific Bell access into cable
television markets in California, Florida, South Carolina, and
Washington State.

According to a Newsbytes report, Craig Watts (manager of
corporate communications for Pacific Telesis Group) said, "The
move into wireless TV is our means of competing with the
aggressive moves of Cox Cable and TCI Cable into telephony over
cable.  Our acquisitions to date give us the ability to offer 100
channel television to over seven million homes in California."

The consideration will be payable by delivery of $120 million of
Pacific Telesis common stock and the assumption of approximately
$55 million of debt to Videotron and Transworld.  The transaction
is intended to be tax free to the Transworld shareholders, who
will receive shares of Pacific Telesis common stock in exchange
for their Transworld stock on its liquidation.

Pacific Bell also reported that, through its Pacific Telesis
Video Services unit, it plans to develop content for the cable
operations.  It will also obtain video content from Tele-TV, the
joint venture formed by Pacific Telesis, NYNEX, and Bell Atlantic
(Pacific Telesis Group, 130 Kearny Street, San Francisco CA

Thomson Invests $25 Million in StarSight

Thomson Multimedia has become the second largest owner of
StarSight Telecast Inc., by purchasing 13.25 percent of
StarSight's stock for $25 million, with an option to raise its
investment to 19.5 percent at $42 million.

The move provides working capital for StarSight, a developer of
on-screen TV program guides, which reported a loss of $25.5
million in the first nine months of its fiscal year'.  "The real
story is that we are banking on the success of StarSight and
backing it with our dollars in an aggressive move.  We would like
to see StarSight become the standard," said James Myer (senior
vice president, Thomson Consumer Electronics).  "We... believe
that electronic program guides will become a very important
feature in televisions and VCRs in the future."

Under the agreement, Thomson is expected to ''aggressively
incorporate'' and promote StarSight technology and related
services in selected product lines.  In return, Thomson will be
compensated for its marketing efforts and will share in StarSight
Telecast revenues with respect to StarSight Telecast's consumer
electronics business.  According to StarSight, the two companies
also will establish a marketing fund for joint promotion of
StarSight-capable products.

Other corporate "partners" in StarSight are:  Viacom, which owns
23.4 percent; Cox Broadcasting (8.6 percent); The Tribune Company
(4.5 percent); Providence Journal (3.15 percent); and Time Warner
(3.1 percent) (Thomson, 10330 North Meridian, Indianapolis IN

Multimedia is Disappearing
Fall Comdex 1995

13 - 17 November:  Las Vegas NV
Sponsored by Softbank

By JOHN N. LATTA, Ph.D.
Senior Contributing Editor

Welcome to Comdex.  In a town packed with 200,000 visitors over a
five-day period, patience certainly wears thin.  While the
conference seemed to run more smoothly under new owner Softbank's
guidance, no matter how you describe the event, the bottom line
is that Comdex is a one-of-a-kind -- unpleasant to navigate, yet
essential to attend.

Comdex continues to deliver the best keynotes in the industry.
An outstanding talk was given by Louis Gerstner (Chairman and
CEO, IBM Corporation) which is summarized in this issue.  In
another keynote, Bill Gates (Chairman and CEO, Microsoft)
examined the future of computing with the aid of a video
depicting life in a small town.  In many respects Gates'
presentation was similar to the "Information at Your Fingertips -
- 2000" speech he delivered last year.  However, his emphasis has
shifted to the Internet and how PCs and applications
(Microsoft's, of course) can be seamlessly linked together.
Missing from his presentation was the wallet PC which Gates had
described several times in the past -- including his presentation
at last year's Comdex (Softbank, Softbank, 303 Vintage Park
Drive, Foster City CA 94404, 415/578-6900).

3D Comes Out

In the area of 3D chip development, what was a trickle only six
months ago (see Siggraph 95 coverage, Monitor 10/95 p20) has now
turned into a flood.  What follows is a summary of the chip
announcements at Comdex.

Analysis:  The Significance of 3D

o    For consumers, 3D means "fun."  Because real-time 3D
technology allows users to change their viewpoint, it places the
users in control and not subject to the whims of the designer.
This flexibility extends beyond games and is applicable to the
proliferation of consumer programs which permit walk-throughs of
spaces, the design of homes, and 3D visualization.

o    3D brings a new level of visual realism to the PC
experience.  The public has become accustomed to higher levels of
entertainment quality, founded on multimedia, and 3D is the next
logical step.

o    3D is rapidly becoming a mainstream component of software.
Already, home design programs, especially those in 3D, are
selling very well.  Individuals relate to visual realism, easy-
to-use programs, and their ability to control the creation of the
content and participation in it.  With 3D, the PC becomes a
visual computer, even more so than it did with the introduction
of video.

o    PC entertainment software is continually looking for ways to
press the leading edge of the user experience.  3D extends the
range of opportunities for content developers.  q

3D Game and Content Developers

o    Mindscape Inc.  recently released CyberSpeed, the first game
to use Microsoft-owned Rendermorphic's Reality Lab API and a
direct port of the Sony PlayStation game.  Mindscape wanted to
show how well 3D can be accomplished in a software only
application, and the company achieved 25 frames per second in
320x240 mode -- stretched to 640x480.  Kevin Bachus (Manager of
International Development) said, "the improvement in graphics
quality will be a major boost to the game industry." Mindscape's
development strategy, according to Bachus, is to price titles
aggressively (from $19.95 to $29.95) and to stress the
development of fewer titles -- which imparts a sense of quality
to consumers.  This combination will enable Mindscape to set new
levels of sell through -- in the 500,000 to 1,000,000 range per
title (60 Leveroni Court, Novato CA 94949, 415/883-3000, fax
415/883-3303).

o    Velocity chairman and chief technology officer Moses Ma
noted that many market opportunities for 3D software come from
the many bundling deals being offered by the chip and board
companies.  "As with CD-ROM bundling in the early phases of this
market, bundling with 3D will drive most of the installed base,"
according to Ma "Bundling will force the developers to squeeze
every bit of performance from the 3D chips."  At the same time,
he said that an essential component to the success of 3D is the
need for the business 3D equivalent of Lotus 1-2-3.  "There must
be a mainstream 3D application," said Ma.  Unfortunately,
according to Ma, developers are limited by a lack of good 3D
tools (Suite 3100, 4 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco CA 94111,
415/776-8000).

o    Aaron Howard (president and CEO, Media Station) said the
potential for 3D lies in the context of its existing underlying
object-oriented technology.  He said that "3D should be a plug-in
module." Predicting that 3D will reach its potential in 1996 and
beyond, Howard said, "The move to 3D will be incremental." He
expressed some reservations on the potential of Microsoft's
Direct X tools for game development -- not because of the
technology, but because it limits the delivery platform to
Windows 95.  "Media Station has the technology to allow a single
CD-ROM to work on either a PC or Mac," he noted.  "Thus, cross-
platform support is essential."

The Internet, according to Howard, has the potential to increase
the sense of community and experience when used in conjunction
with CD-ROM.  For example, it is possible to add, via the
Internet, other characters to a title.  "Although today's model
for the Internet with Web home pages is a publishing metaphor,"
Howard said, "VRML and Java allow possible extensions to a
virtual world."  However, he warned, creating this new Internet
model will be an evolutionary process.  As with many executives
looking at the Internet, Howard is still examining how the
Internet can be a money-making proposition.  One way might be to
charge a nominal fee to give the user access to a new metaphor,
provide control, and offer value-added features (1140 Eisenhower
Place, Ann Arbor MI 48108, 313/971-1112).

o    Dave Feldman (director of technology at PF Magic) said,
"With 3D acceleration, the PC is finally competitive with home
video game systems; however, the $2,000 price for a PC will
always position it as a high-end, general purpose solution
against the low-price home video game." Feldman said 3D chips
will be used more and more for accelerating the functions in
Microsoft's Reality Lab in order to obtain maximum performance.
The first-generation 3D cards are inadequate, and it will take a
year to get cards which take maximum advantage of Microsoft's
Direct 3D capabilities.

"One of the key issues in the game industry is that the profits
are not there yet.  The attention, budgets, and talent still go
to the feature movie productions," he said (Suite 400, 501 Second
Street, San Francisco CA 94107, 415/495-0400).

o    According to Rob Harris (vice president of technology at
Accolade Inc.), two components are missing in PCs equipped with
3D chips:  3D acceleration and a PC game controller.  When PCs
finally acquire these missing ingredients, they will begin be on
a more level playing field with home video game systems.
"Neither platform will dominate the other, however," he said.

Harris said that Microsoft's Direct X, Direct 3D, and Direct Play
will make the PC more truly "plug and play."  However, the
industry remains in a transition period while Windows 95 gains a
foothold, and titles are developed which make best use of both
the operating systems and the new additions for gaming (5300
Stevens Creek Boulevard, San Jose CA 95129, 408/985-1700).

3D Software Companies

o    Eric Hautemont (president, Ray Dream) predicted a
significant shift in the market to the casual user of 3D.
Originally, Ray Dream positioned its tools for the graphics
professional.  However, with the recently released Ray Dream
Studio, Hautemont expects more than 40 percent of sales will be
to hobbyists -- mostly young males from 15 to 30 who are anxious
to replicate their game experiences enhanced with 3D.

With the addition of animation capabilities, Hautemont's products
will be able to compete with high-end packages such as 3D Studio
MAX, but are much more cost effective and -- at the same time --
provide a tool for the graphics professional and the budding
casual user.  To bolster the position of Ray Dream Studio, the
company supports an open architecture with an open API.  The
program CD-ROM includes a 400-page document on how to write plug-
ins for Ray Dream Studio (1804 North Shoreline Boulevard,
Mountain View CA 94043, 415/960-0768, fax 415/960-1198).

o    Mark Walton (vice president for Marketing and Sales at
3D/Eye Inc.) said that his company's emphasis on intelligent
models and drag-and-drop functionality "will make it possible for
anyone to create 3D content."  Walton said that although the
current chip sets are tuned for the game market, this technology
also will still support the task of making 3D omnipresent in the
workplace.  To do this, 3D/Eye has taken its CAD modeling
experience and included visual, physical, functional, and
behavioral information in the model.

3D/Eye wants to make 3D simple enough to allow it  to be used by
many parts of an organization.  This scope of model
transportability requires a new level of model description and
ease of use -- an objective which 3D/Eye expects to fulfill (1050
Craft Road, Ithaca NY 14850, 607/257-1381).

o    Doug Richard (CEO, Visual Software Inc.) said, "The 3D
accelerator chips will make applications much easier to use."  To
create a large 3D software market, Richard said, models must be
readily available and reusable.  His company's Visual Reality
includes 2 GB of models and textures.

Visual Software is geared to meet the needs of three audiences:
the professional (via Visual Reality 2.0), the enthusiast or
hobbyist (Simply 3D), and the office worker who must create a
presentation (Instant 3D).  "Our strategy requires that we must
have the highest level of tools to gain the broadest market
acceptance," said Richard (21731 Ventura Boulevard, Woodland
Hills CA 91364, 818/883-7900).

o    Another view of the 3D market comes from those with a long
history in it -- the professional animators and those who supply
the software.  One leading company, Side Effects, offers two
programs for the Silicon Graphics family of computers:  PRISMS, a
3D animation system, and Houdini -- a next-generation animation
tool which integrates 2D and 3D.

Greg Hermanovic (principal, Side Effects) said that the high-end
-- that is, SGI -- platforms provide real-time interaction for
the artist.  The introduction of high-performance, 3D chips will
allow professional animators to use lower-cost platforms -- but
for the PC to be effective against the SGI platform, it needs not
only chips, but an operating systems and work station level-
performance.

Hermanovic said that Windows NT could provide the necessary
software, and DEC Alpha systems could provide the hardware.
However, he said, "as long as the SGI platform is superior in
price performance -- even at the $30,000 to $50,000 range, it
will offer the more viable high-end solution."  He predicted that
the market for 3D animation software and hardware will continue
to grow at a rate of 40 percent per year (Suite 1001, 477
Richmond Street West, Toronto ONT MSV 3E7 Canada, 416/504-9876).

3D Home Design

o    3D has already established an important market niche with
home design programs.  Planix, which merged with Softdesk Inc.
in January 1995, is a company that has moved from the high-end
CAD market to the mass market with products such as Planix Home
Architect and Exterior Designer.  Augie Grasis (vice president
for Retail Products, Planix) said he credits the growth of this
market with the fact that "people like 3D -- it's fun.  The
typical home user does not relate well with how a plan will look.
Having 3D visualization brings plans alive."  From a developer's
perspective, Planix is continually faced with the trade-off
between realism and performance.  What the 3D chip allows is a
significant increase in realism.  The Planix software has already
sold 100,000 units.  Grasis predicted a potential market upwards
of 500,000 to 1,000,000 units (Softdesk, 13618 Robin Hill Court,
Houston TX 77059, 713/480-4630).

o    Ken Tarolla (vice president for development, Expert Software
Inc.) reported that his company has already sold one million
copies of its 3D home design programs.  One of the newest
enhancements allows users to produce a layout of the outside of
the house.  Another feature enables the placement of plants and
trees and simulates the growth of this flora over a five to
fifteen year period -- all in a matter of minutes.

Tarolla said the future success of this product category hinges
on the inclusion of texture mapping and built-in links to home
construction products and furnishing companies.  Such links will
allow the home user to realistically see the home before
committing to a design.  Tarolla said he looks forward to 3D
accelerators, "but I cannot have my products dependent on their
penetration."  Growth in capabilities and performance will from
the improvement in processors, he predicted.  Tarolla also
expressed reservations about the potential for VRML and networked
3D.  "I am not sure it will provide the support and quality which
my products need," he said (1443 Franklin Street, Santa Monica CA
90404, 310/828-8719).

3D Networking

o    An early pioneer in networked 3D is Ziff-Davis Interactive,
which announced a interactive virtual reality area, called ZD3D,
on its Web site (http://www.zdnet.com) and in its Microsoft
Network edition (GO ZDNET).  ZD3D is based on software technology
licensed from InterVista.  Tom Aley (product manager) said that
"3D will lower the barriers of entry into the Internet and bring
an element of entertainment."

The Ziff-Davis mission is to support early adopters, and ZD3D is
very much in line with that objective, said Aley.  According to
Aley, the Ziff-Davis Web site is seventh most heavily visited
site in existence, with 350,000 hits per month.  Aley noted that
the impact of the 'Net as an advertising medium are only now
being felt.  "The impact of the 'Net caught many advertisers off
guard," he said, "and, already, ten percent of the media spending
will be shifted to the Internet in 1996 (25 First Street,
Cambridge MA 02154, 617/252-5000).

3D Creative Talent

o    Many producers and suppliers to the industry repeatedly
sited a significant problem present in the industry today:  the
lack of enough 3D animation and content development talent.
According to Bob Stanton of TSC Management Services Group, the
skills most in demand are at the high-end (i.e.  SGI platforms).
Top talent commands salaries of $80,000 to $140,000, plus
royalties and commissions.  "The industry has become so
competitive," according to Stanton, "that the recruiting model is
changing to a talent agency model."  Individuals or firms have
begun to hire firms to represent them in negotiations for
projects or productions.  "The net result," said Stanton, "is
that the price of success continues to escalate, which makes it
more difficult for the small production company to create a
market presence without the help from major publishers or
production companies."

3D Animation and Production

o    Chris Wallace of TOPIX Computer Graphics and Animation
reported that his firm recently opened a division called TOPIX
Interactive, which is specifically focused on creating content
for CD-ROMs and the Internet.  He pointed out that "much of the
3D we see today is of low quality, and this parallels the early
products from the desktop publishing systems."  Thus, he
predicted, the market will gravitate to the professionals (of
which he sees far too few) to create compelling content.

Multimedia in Chips

Comdex was something of a "coming out party" for the first
generation of multimedia chips.  The last several years have seen
an important transformation of the PC industry.  With the home PC
growth rate at 25 percent and household penetration at 33 percent
and climbing, it is no wonder that the home PC market is
increasingly dominating the industry.

Central to the success of the PC in the home is multimedia.
Beginning in 1994 and continuing in 1995, the Pentium processor
has been the processor of choice among consumers.  The Pentium
has fueled the market for better video display and better
multimedia titles.  Yet, the economics of silicon continue to
force increased functionality into fewer and fewer chips.  What
was once supplied on add-in cards will move to the motherboard.
Rumor has it that in 1996, Intel will announce instructions for
the next generation Pentium, the P55C, which will support
multimedia.  An overriding question within the industry is, "Will
Intel make the multimedia instruction set on these machines
open?"

By reducing the technology to silicon, costs can be significantly
decreased and the functionality increased.  The last six months
have seen increasing numbers of multimedia chips announced.  It
will take at least 12 months for these chips to migrate to the
motherboards.  When this migration happens, the quality of
multimedia should again increase (i.e.  the image quality of the
full-motion video playback, along with improved sound and 3D
quality).

o    ATI Technologies Inc.  introduced the ATI-264VT, a full-
featured 64-bit multimedia processor that offers 2D graphics
acceleration, as well as full-screen, full-motion video playback
(including MPEG).  This latest addition to ATI's mach64 family of
products uses a unique video buffer architecture that scales in
both the horizontal and vertical directions, resulting in smooth-
and natural-motion video.  It supports full screen, full-motion
television-quality MPEG or Video CD output.  In addition, the
ATI-264VT was built specifically to enhance game play and has
been designed to take advantage of Microsoft's Windows 95 Game
SDK.  The accelerator contains an integrated 135 MHz RAMDAC and
supports multiple memory types, including FP/EDO DRAM, SDRAM, or
SGRAM.  In production in the first quarter of 1996, it will be
available for $33 in large quantities.

ATI also introduced its Enhanced Visual Architecture (EVA), which
provides a method for multimedia devices to share resources and
exchange video, audio, and graphics data.  The EVA architecture
is supported the ATI-264VT.

ATI also showed the 3D Rage accelerator chip for 3D graphics and
multimedia.  In addition to 3D graphics performance of up to
600,000 Gouraud shaded triangles per second, the accelerator also
provides 2D and video acceleration.  The 3D capabilities include:
perspective corrected bi-linear and tri-linear texture filtering
modes, alpha blending, and fog and texture lighting.  Sporting
broadcast-quality, full-screen, full-motion MPEG video, 3D Rage
offers the easy add-on design of TV tuners, hardware MPEG, and
video conferencing.  Also integrated into the chip is a 135 MHz
DAC with a true 24-bit palette that supports gamma correction.
Priced at $48 for large quantities, full production is slated to
begin in the first quarter of 1996.

Further, ATI introduced Video Xpression, an extendable, 64-bit
multimedia accelerator board designed to bridge the gap between
the PC, television, and game console.  The product features TV-
quality video on a PC and significantly enhanced Windows 95
utilities.  By using the video processor capabilities of the ATI-
264VT, Video Xpression displays full-screen, full-motion TV-
quality video for MPEG and Video CD movie discs on the PC.  It
displays 30 frames-per-second video on all Pentium-class systems.
Video Xpression will be available in January 1996 for $199 (33
Commerce Valley Drive East, Thornhill ONT L3T 7N6 Canada,
905/882-2600, fax 905/882-2620).

o    Avance Logic Inc.  introduced a 64-bit PCI graphics/video
accelerator chipset, combining video acceleration, graphics
functions, and the ability to input live video data streams from
MPEG and TV decoders.  The ALG25128 chipset supports full video
input and output and enables full-screen MPEG playback.  It
includes the company's Video Wizard technology, which is
necessary for MPEG playback, and includes functions for color
space conversion, XY interpolated zoom, and pixel packing.

The scaling technology also has been enhanced to provide 30 fps
full-screen viewing for television signals, MPEG video, and
interactive CD-ROMs.  In addition, the ALG25128 has the ability
to output to either VGA or NTSC/PAL, allowing consumers to output
video to a TV screen.  Application drives will be available for
Xing and Mediamatics MPEG decoders and Indeo, CinePak, and
QuickTime.  The chipset is being offered to OEM customers at less
than $18 for large quantities.  Full-scale production is
scheduled to begin in January 1996 (47509 Seabridge Drive,
Fremont CA 94538, 510/226-9555, fax 510/226-8039).

o    Chromatic Research Inc., together with Toshiba America
Electronic Components Inc.  and LG Semicon Company Ltd.,
presented the Mpact media engine (Monitor 11/95 p7), a multimedia
acceleration chip whose two components -- a single, ultra-high-
bandwidth, highly parallel media processor, and "mediaware"
software modules -- enable seven chip functions:  video, 2D and
3D graphics acceleration, audio, fax/modem, telephony, and
videophone.

The chip includes a PCI interface; Rambus interface; Peripheral
Bus (PBus) interface, Display interface, Video interface, and the
Mpact Mediaware Modules (for JPEG, MEPG-1, MPEP-2, VGA, and GUI
2D Windows acceleration, 3D graphics, audio, fax/modem,
telephony, and video conferencing).  The high bandwidth
capabilities of the Mpact are evident in the Rambus Interface
which will support 500 MB/second burst data transfers.  The PBus
can support up to 14 virtual channels (programmable), which can
include DMA, parallel, and serial interfaces.  The DMA channels
have a total bandwidth of 25 MB/second.

The Mpact will support a wide variety of display resolutions,
from television standards (including NTSC) to computer displays
as large as 1,200x1,600.  The programmable Video interface
supports both the input and output of video in 16-bit YUV format,
and the chip can handle pixel scaling, color space conversion,
and dithering.

Currently the only chip to offer a complete multimedia solution -
- combining VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) and Single
Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectures for very fast
performance -- the Mpact also makes use of Rambus memory
technology, offering very high bandwidth coupled with reduced
board space and cost (CRI, 800 East Middlefield Road, Mountain
View CA 94043-4030, 415/254-1600; Toshiba, 9775 Toledo Way,
Irvine CA 92718, 714/455-2000, fax 714/453-0125).

o    MicroUnity Inc.  revealed some of the details of its
anticipated MediaProcessor design.  The MediaProcessor
architecture is a revolutionary multimedia and broadband
communications technology based on a mixture of CISC, RISC, and
DSP technologies.  It is expected to run at clock frequencies up
to 1 GHz, which is three times faster than the fastest
microprocessor today.  The MediaProcessor is intended to
eventually supplant today's microprocessors by providing high-
speed networked processing power.  In addition, it can also
implement all conventional multimedia functions, such as 2D and
3D graphics acceleration, video compression and decompression,
and audio synthesis.

MicroUnity plans to start production on the first generation of
MediaProcessors in early 1996.  The key discriminator of
MicroUnity is its focus on broadband signal processing.  Today
these broadband solutions typically are accomplished by using
multiple ASIC chips, a method that certainly can accomplish the
task.  However, MicroUnity purports that such a method results in
fragmented , poorly integrated, inflexible designs.

The MicroUnity solution is based on three components:
MediaBridge, MediaProcessor, and the MediaCodec.  The MediaBridge
connects the MediaChannel to DRAM memories or the PCI bus.  The
MediaCodec is a mixed-signal device which has two broadband RF
transceivers (6-8 MHz channels within a 1 GHz range) and support
for video I/O, stereo audio I/O, telephony, and infrared.  The
critical component of MicroUnity strategy is software which
enables the MediaProcessor to exercise its flexibility.  Integral
to the design of the MediaProcessor is a MediaChannel which
provides multi-Gigabytes per second interfaces between the
processor and outside devices, operating at a peak bandwidth of 4
GB/second.

MicroUnity claims that the MediaProcessor would be very well
suited for 3D processing and image generation.  The company
intends to provide a library of functions which include:  audio
(MPEG, Dolby AC-3); video (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and NTSC encode and
decode); communications (QAM and QPSK modems); Reed-Solomon error
correction; DES encryption; broadband MAC protocols; and network
protocols including Ethernet, MPEG control, and ISDN.

MicroUnity has been described as a high-risk, high-payback
proposition.  The company is understood to have in excess of $100
million in funding.  Although its backers have not been
disclosed, they are widely rumored to include Microsoft,
Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, TCI, US West, and Cray Research (255
Caspian Drive, Sunnyvale CA 94089-1015, 408/734-8100, fax 408-
734-8136).

o    nVidia Corporation displayed its NV1 multimedia accelerator,
which was unveiled earlier in the year (Monitor 10/95 p24).  In
addition to 2D Windows GUI acceleration, the chip also features
photo-realistic 3D graphics capabilities based on nVidia's unique
"curved-surface polygon" rendering techniques, as well as
"lightning fast" texture-mapping.  Based on a second order
quadratic surface description, the NV1 rendering technology
allows for simpler objects and lower memory bandwidth
requirements in the rasterization process.  However, this
modeling approach requires features in tools which are not widely
available today.  The vast majority of 3D content is presently
done using a polygonal approach.

The chip supports wavetable audio synthesis and full-motion video
playback with a sustainable rate of 30 frames per second of true-
color digital video.  The NV1 chip is also the first of its kind
to features a digital game port, which allows a joystick to
directly access the PC's main memory.  The NV1 is priced around
$200 (1226 Tiros Way, Sunnyvale CA 94086, 408-720-6100, fax 408-
720-6111).

o    Philips Semiconductors Inc.  introduced the TriMedia
embedded microprocessor architecture, on which the first product,
the TriMedia-1 will be based.  Consisting of a single
microprocessor, the TriMedia-1 architecture combines the benefits
of VLIW and DSP architectures, resulting in a peak performance of
2.5 billion operations/second operating at 100 MHz.  One goal of
the design was to integrate digital signal processors,
specialized chips (or ASICs), and a general purpose processor
into one chip.

This high-performance design permits mixed multimedia processing
including MPEG-1 decoding at 30 fps with superimposed texture-
mapped 3D graphics.  A 100 MHz TriMedia chip uses only 22 percent
of its processing power to perform MPEG-1 decoding, while the
remaining 78 percent will support 3D at 150,000 polygons/second
with texture mapping, alpha blending, and Z-buffering.

The TriMedia processor contains a programmable CPU core, which
can be programmed and optimized at the C language level.  A full
software development environment is provided, offering
programmers powerful and easy tools for developing software.  The
TM-1 -- the first in a family of TriMedia processors -- is the
core processor with a PCI bus (due for release in mid-1996).  The
TM-VP, a Video Phone Chip, is also due out in 1996.  Another
chip, expected in 1997 or 1998 is the TM-TV the digital TV chip.
(811 East  Arques Avenue, Sunnyvale CA 94088-3409, 800/234-7318,
fax 708/296-8556).

o    Tseng Labs Inc.  unveiled the ET6000, a high-speed graphics
and multimedia engine.  Designed to take advantage of the Windows
95 operating system, the ET6000 offers a 128-bit graphics
accelerator employing the new MDRAM memory architecture by MoSys
Inc.  It also supports Microsoft's DirectDraw API for an advanced
gaming experience.  An internal video processing engine delivers
full-motion, high-resolution video playback and allows the
simultaneous display of up to four digital video windows.  The
chip supports YUV to RGB conversion, color keying, gamma
correction, and 128-bit GUI acceleration.  The ET6000 will handle
playback of software codecs for Indeo, Cinepak, TrueMotion, and
MPEG.  Production is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of
1996 (6 Terry Drive, Newton PA 18940, 215/968-0502, fax 215/860-
7713).

COMDEX, CONTINUED: Other New Products

Windows 95 Update

o    Microsoft Corporation provided a snapshot of the "state of
Windows 95."  As of this writing, more than seven million units
of Windows 95 had been purchased (including OEM and upgrade
sales) and over four million PCs had been sold with Windows 95
preinstalled.

In the first eight weeks of availability, Windows 95 was
purchased and deployed by at least 160 companies worldwide; and
more than half of Microsoft's top 1,000 US corporate accounts
have moved beyond the pilot stage to deploy Windows 95 across
their organizations.  More than 25 percent of software revenue
generated in September 1995 was attributed to products designed
to run on Windows 95; currently, some 700 products are designed
to run on Windows 95.  Finally, according to a survey by Burke
Customer Satisfaction, more than 90 percent of customers in
Europe and the US are satisfied with Windows 95 (One Microsoft
Way, Redmond WA 98052, 206/882-8080).

3D Graphics

o    3D Labs Inc.  introduced Permedia, its second-generation,
low-cost 3D graphics accelerator family, which offers 2D, 3D, and
video acceleration.  The Permedia provides high-performance 3D
acceleration based on 3D Labs' GLINT graphics processors, with up
to 25 million texture-mapped pixels/second, with perspective
correction and full bi-linear filtering.  Other 3D capabilities
include Gouraud shading, optional z-buffering, fogging,
transparency, overlays, and stencils at a rate of up to 500,000
50-pixel triangles/second.  3D Labs will first make the Permedia
chip available to selected OEMs in the first quarter of 1996.
Catering to the home PC market, the resulting multimedia graphics
solutions are expected to be priced at under $250 (Suite 403,
2010 North First Street, San Jose CA 95131, 408/436-3455, fax
408/436-3458).

o    3Dfx Interactive Inc.  introduced Voodoo Graphics, a 3D
graphics accelerator targeted at 3D entertainment applications in
both the coin-operated/arcade and home consumer markets.  The
accelerator features several 3D functions including advanced
texture mapping, texture compositing, texture morphing, and
animated textures.  Optimized for real-time 3D generation, Voodoo
Graphics supports perspectively correct polygons with point-
sampled texture mapping, z- and double-buffering, Gouraud
shading, LOD MIP-mapping, and bilinear filtering.  On a typical
Pentium-90 computer system, the resulting performance is more
than 45 megapixel/second fill rate, with over 350,000
triangles/second.

Voodoo Graphics consists of two separate chips:  the pixelfx,
which is the primary graphics controller, and the texelfx, an
advanced texture-processing unit.  The chipset operates under
most PC operating systems and development environments (DOS,
Windows NT, Window 95, and SGI's IRIX) and provides support for a
number of 3D APIs.

To date, both Orchid Technology Inc.  and FMI Graphics Products
have signed OEM agreements with 3Dfx to develop consumer 3D game
boards based on Voodoo Graphics.  In addition, 3Dfx is working
with a large number of leading PC and coin-op game developers to
create multimedia titles based on the chipset.  Voodoo Graphics
is priced at less than $75 in 20,000 piece quantities (Suite 105,
415 Clyde Avenue, Mountain View CA 94043, 415-934-2400, fax 415-
934-2424).

o    Elsa Inc.  introduced the Winner 1000Trio/V, a low-cost
multimedia graphics accelerator board.  Winner 1000Trio/V
features 64-bit graphics and full-screen MPEG/AVI acceleration,
DirectDraw/DCI support, and flicker-free VGA refresh rates.  The
board also includes a software MPEG decoder and support for Video
CD full-screen playback (Suite 165, 2041 Mission College
Boulevard, Santa Clara CA 95054, 800/272-ELSA, fax 408/565-9650).

o    Rendition displayed its Verite graphics processor, which
provides hardware acceleration for 3D graphics, video color space
conversion, and 2D graphics acceleration.  Using an on-chip RISC
processor, the Verite accelerates more of the 3D graphics
pipeline than conventional low-end rasterization chips.  It can
render up to 160,000 Gouraud-shaded, bi-linear filtered,
perspectively correct texture-mapped, fogged, 50-pixel
triangles/second -- double-buffered scenes to be rendered at 30
frames/second at 640x480x65 KB colors, resulting in smooth,
realistic animations.  In addition, the chip provides MPEG-1
color space conversion and video scaling at 30 frames/second.
The Verite chip will be available in early 1996.

Rendition also announced it has signed an agreement with Creative
Technology Ltd.  to provide the Verite graphics processor for
Creative's next-generation 3D Blaster products (1675 North
Shoreline Boulveard, Mountain View CA 94043-1366, 415/335-5900,
fax 415/335-5999).

o    S3 Inc.  introduced the ViRGE and ViRGE/VX 64-bit graphics
and video accelerators.  Based on the company's S3d architecture,
these single-chip products integrate 3D rendering, 2D GUI, video
acceleration, and a clock synthesizer.  The S3d provides
triangle-based polygon rendering, along with complete texture
mapping capabilities.  It also supports advanced features such as
bi-linear filtering, MIP-mapping and tri-linear MIP-mapping for
clear and realistic-looking images.  In addition, the S3d MUX
buffering feature permits z-buffering support without the high
cost of dedicated hardware z-buffer memory.

The ViRGE chip, which is targeted at the mainstream home PC
market, offers 2D GUI acceleration for resolutions up to
1,280x1,024x256 colors at 75 Hz, as well as support for 30
frames/second video and audio decoding.  The ViRGE/VX chip --
geared for the high-end of the market, such as arcade-level
games, PC-based CAD, and large-screen applications  -- supports
resolutions up to 1600 x 1200 x 16 million colors at 75 Hz.  It
has RAMDAC performance levels of 220 MHz.

The ViRGE chip will begin shipping in the first quarter of 1996
for $40 each in volumes of 10,000 or more.  The ViRGE/VX will go
into production in the first quarter of 1996 and will be
available for $65 each in 10,000-unit or more quantities (2770
San Thomas Expressway, Santa Clara CA 95051-0968, 408/980-5400,
fax 408/980-5444).

o    Trident Microsystems Inc.  displayed its T3D2000 2D GUI and
3D graphics acceleration chip.  The product features a graphics
accelerator, VGA controller, bus interface, and memory
controller, providing 3D and video playback acceleration,
hardware rendering, and image enhancement.  The T3D2000's 64-bit
2D GUI accelerator supports resolutions up to 1,600x1,280 with
color depths up to 24 bits.  The 3D rendering engine sports a 64-
bit pipelined architecture, with support for Gouraud shading,

Comdex in Context

Several interesting parallels are apparent in the progression of
computing technology.  Desktop publishing, for example, brought
together the Apple Macintosh, Apple Laser Writer, and Aldus
PageMaker and, in the process, decimated the pre-press business.
Multimedia has yet to completely transform the audio production
business, but very few facilities exist without a Macintosh or
PC.  Likewise, the computer is changing the face of television
studio and post production facilities.  Avid Technology Inc.  is
at the forefront of integrating general purpose computers into
the television production environment.

All of these are examples illustrate how general purpose
technology -- albeit smaller in form and less expensive -- has
managed to assimilate the functions of older technology, becoming
ubiquitous in presence and still providing improved functionality
and performance over the old technology.  Where do 3D and
multimedia chips fit into this advancing tide of technology
progress? With the success of the movie Toy Story the prospect of
creating Toy Story-like animations on the computer and in real-
time is a frontier which companies are anxious to explore.

While 3D chip technology is in its infancy, it's potential has
excited many.  More fundamentally, multimedia technology is
making inroads upon itself.  Where multimedia brought sound to
the PC, we now see sound as part of a chip which offers all the
multimedia functions -- what one might call the super multimedia
chip.  What was standalone and isolated on the PC as an add-in
function has now disappeared into a chip with many functions.
This is the progressive pattern of electronics functionality --
the integration of more functions into silicon, so that its
distinct identity as a component is lost, but the functional
capabilities continue to increase.  Thus, as the quality of
multimedia improves, it becomes present in every PC, but
disappears as separate technology.  In the next wave of
technology advancement, multimedia is being transformed again.
One might say that at the same time it is disappearing,
multimedia is becoming omnipresent.  q

Keynote Address by Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., IBM Corporation

By JOHN N. LATTA, Ph.D.
SENIOR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

IBM CEO Louis Gerstner's keynote was unique, because it featured
very few visual aids.  In a relaxed, walk-around-the-stage
manner, Gerstner gave a compelling assessment of the impact of
information technology on society.  His announcement of the
Interpersonal Computer received considerable press --  but his
keynote was more profound than a product pitch.  Gerstner's
speech was both historical and visionary.  It challenged the
industry to address future issues on how computing technology
will impact society (PO Box 2150, Atlanta GA 30355, 404/238-
3182).

"Every now and then," Gerstner said, "a technology or an idea
comes along that is so profound, so powerful, so universal that
its impact changes everything -- the printing press; the
incandescent light; the automobile; manned flight.  It doesn't
happen often, but when it does, the world is changed forever.  I
joined this industry and IBM because I believe that information
technology has that potential."

Gerstner offered his thoughts on the future of IBM and its role
in making information technology "the defining technology of this
decade" and of the next century.  "IBM researchers see no limits,
for at least a decade, to the underlying technologies that drive
our industry," he said.  "Processor power, memory, disk capacity,
bandwidth -- the trajectories will continue upward."

To illustrate, Gerstner shared a few of the projects under
development in IBM labs.  He described a new kind of optical
microscope that could potentially image a single atom in visible
light.  "This same technology may eventually enable incredibly
dense storage devices that can pack information at densities one
hundred times higher than anything we can demonstrate today," he
said.  "That's the equivalent of putting the entire collection of
the Library of Congress -- sixteen million books -- on a diskette
the size of a penny."

Another product under development at IBM is a high-resolution
ThinkPad flat-panel display.  According to Gerstner, the
prototype that he saw at IBM's research laboratory delivered such
a high-quality image that he was unable to tell the difference
between a color photo attached to a ThinkPad display and a color
panel displaying an actual digital image.

Gerstner also described a speech-technology interface "that
doesn't just recognize dictation -- we have products today that
already do that.  This interface understood what I was saying, it
extracted the meaning of what I was asking for and delivered some
information in response."

The future of computing, said Gerstner, may be more than just
super high-resolution displays and speech recognition.  As he put
it, "Some [technologies] are really 'out there.'" Noting the
industry's tendency to describe itself in terms of faster,
better, cheaper pieces of hardware and software, Gerstner said,
"We're at the threshold of the next major phase of computing," he
said.  "It draws upon many of the technologies we've been
discussing, but one in particular -- high-speed, high-bandwidth
networking -- which is why we refer to it as 'network-centric
computing.'"

This phase of computing, Gerstner pointed out, follows two
others:  "The first was 'mainframe-centric' -- with a large
central processor, centralized data, centralized applications,
centralized systems and network management -- all serving
hundreds and hundreds of 'dumb' terminals," he said.  "This
wasn't a great model for end-users, because they were chained to
the central I/S department for computing power and applications."

The second phase of computing history occurred in the 1980s with
the emergence of the microprocessor, "which made possible the PC,
which made possible shrink-wrapped software, local area networks,
and on and on," according to Gerstner.  "So the model of
computing went from centralized to decentralized, and -- not
surprisingly -- so did the composition of our industry.  We went
from a few large integrated companies to 60,000 niche players,
and that nearly blew IBM up."

However, noted Gerstner, the promise of distributed computing has
not been fully realized.  "Our industry promised customers that
they could buy all these individual pieces, and put them together
very easily.  But that hasn't happened."  Faced with such issues
as system incompatibility and the expense of client/server
computing, "customers are beginning to wonder if they're getting
full value from all of the horsepower and software capability
they buy," said Gerstner.

While the PC solution is a step in the right direction, "is it
really the end-game?" asked Gerstner.  "We've come to understand
that client/server is, in fact, not a full-blown phase of
computing.  It's really the leading edge of what will be the next
phase:  network-centric computing."

While PCs and servers have become enormously powerful, he said,
"they communicate through the equivalent of soda straws."
Gerstner predicted that "very powerful networking technologies --
principally ATM -- will be to the next phase of computing what
the microprocessor was to the current phase... If the
communications link between the PC and the network is cheap
enough, fast enough, and has virtually unlimited bandwidth, why
not migrate a lot of the functions that currently reside inside
the PC to the network -- the applications, the data, the storage,
and even some of the processing?"

Customers, he pointed out, don't care where these functions take
place, "as long as what happens in front of the screen is
compelling, simple to use, and is the least-expensive solution
available."

In making the jump to network-centric computing, end-users will
find a number of advantages.  For example, Gerstner noted,
customers will be able to upgrade their PCs "by subscribing to
higher levels of computational power on the network."  Instead of
the consumer having to "figure out those arcane things called
operating systems," the network will "mask that complexity and
incompatibility."  In addition, with network-centric computing,
consumers will no longer have to buy "a shelf-full of
applications, swapping dozens of diskettes in and out, and
repeating this delightful task when version 2.5.4 comes out in
nine months."

Envisioning the evolution of a new "Interpersonal Computer" that
truly is suited for communications and interaction, Gerstner
predicted that there will be fundamental changes in PCs.
However, he said, "the network-centric world will not replace the
PC world entirely any more than the PC world replaced the
mainframe world entirely."

Network-centric computing will arrive in a number of guises, said
Gerstner.  It has already arrived in the form of the explosive
growth of the Internet, and it will come to the consumer market
in the form of interactive services to the home.  "We are seeing
[network-centric computing] take off first in businesses and
large institutions," Gerstner said.  "Technology is only an
enabler of a much more powerful force:  a whole new way that
institutions and companies have conceptualized their strategic
priorities.  They've discovered a powerful new form of leverage:
the leverage of organizational knowledge as a means to compete
more effectively and to differentiate themselves in the
marketplace."

Gerstner opined that the "most important, most valuable, most
sought-after content in the world belongs to corporations and
large institutions.  It's created and collected every minute,
around the world:  intellectual property, designs, market
intelligence, supply and demand, customer trends."  He said that
powerful networks can "unlock this knowledge, and move it to the
people who can use it effectively.  This drives shorter cycle
times and allows teams of people to become more productive and
creative."  These concrete, real-world benefits, said Gerstner,
are key in convincing companies to make large-scale investments
in network technology.

Gerstner predicted that as companies use networks to reach out to
their customers directly, the nature of competition will change
dramatically.  "Companies that stand between a supplier and a
customer will be on dangerous ground," he said.  "Something very
significant is happening here.  For the first time, the models of
computing that support businesses and institutions on the one
hand and individual users on the other are coming together...
They're converging network-centric computing."

As network-centric computing evolves, said Gerstner, "it will
transform every business, organization, and institution in the
world... It will change the way we do business, the way we teach
our children, communicate and interact as individuals."  Noting
that IBM is making "enormous investments in Internet products and
services," Gerstner stated, "We're taking network-centric
computing very seriously at IBM.  I'd say we're betting much of
our future on it."

According to Gerstner, some of the important issues involved in
network-centric computing include "complex network management,
systems management, heavy transaction processing, massive data
bases, powerful scalable servers, and systems integration... Now,
let me think, what company knows how to do all that?"

All kidding aside, Gerstner said that the future of computing is
"right before us," but will only happen if "we step up to certain
responsibilities as an industry."  These responsibilities, he
said, fit under one banner:  listening to the customer.  "I don't
think we pay nearly enough attention -- or spend nearly enough
money -- being sensitive and responsive to customers," he said.

"I think we need to work on many things, but three in
particular," said Gerstner.  "The first is ease of use" -- an
issue that "ranges from basic confusion over on-off switches and
loading software to the way we integrate and manage complex
systems."

The second major issue facing the industry is standards.  "Ours
is the only major industry I can think of that refuses to rally
around standards," he said.  "How are we ever going to get around
the problem of incompatible hardware and software systems?"
Gerstner offered two choices:  asking customers to set aside
their freedom of choice, and "all of us move to one architecture
provided by, priced by and controlled by one company.  Or, we can
embrace open industry standards.  Compliance with standards does
not mean that we won't compete aggressively or that we can't
distinguish our products.  We will.  But we'll compete on the
basis of innovative implementation of industry-standards
technologies and architecture -- on performance, features,
design, service, and support."

Finally, said Gerstner, "We've got to come to grips with the fact
that the proliferation of our technology raises some very
provocative and serious societal issues... Our industry operates
in free space.  It's part of the reason for its success.  This
freedom must be honored and protected -- but it also must be
earned."  He pointed out that while some people see the Internet
as the proverbial "information superhighway," others view it as
"a dangerous pipeline for pornography, intellectual property
theft, and a serious threat to commerce and privacy."

Another grave concern, Gerstner noted, is the issue of universal
access.  People are concerned about "creating a society of
technological 'haves' and 'have-nots.' Just last week," he said,
"I read a survey in Time magazine.  Nearly half the respondents
said that technological change was responsible for the growing
economic inequality between people.

"These are serious issues," he continued.  "There are many
different and divergent views on what to do about them.  Frankly,
most of the solutions that are being proposed are equally
troubling.  They raise questions of censorship, over-regulation,
and, of course, the specter that the fires of innovation that
drive our industry will be stamped out."

The information technology industry, said Gerstner, has grand and
ambitious visions.  "We're talking about no less than changing
the world in very fundamental ways," he said.  "Yet... what will
you hear and see here at Comdex? Megahertz, gigabits, and
multitasking.  There's a disconnect between our priorities and
those of a lot of people and governments."

The time has come, said Gerstner, "to step up to these
challenges... We must do this as individual companies, but also
as an industry."  He pointed to several effort already underway
to address some of these issues:  "The Worldwide Web Consortium
based at MIT is working with many companies, including IBM, on
filtering technologies and content rating for parents to use.
The Center for Democracy and Technology, also with the support of
many companies and advocacy groups, is working on free speech and
child protection.  And trade associations like the Computer
Systems Policy Project are working on privacy and cryptography."

While these organizations "have a lot of good thinking under
way," said Gerstner, "we have to be careful not to confuse
activity with results... We've got to lead, rather than be led."
Referring to such monumental events in history as the inventions
of the printing press and the incandescent light bulb, Gerstner
noted that it is "extraordinary and rare -- and humbling --
opportunity to earn a place in history.  I, for one, think we
will.  I think we will make our visions reality.  I think that as
stewards of our industry, we will step up to the challenges of
social responsibility."

Gerstner summed up his vision of the industry's future with an
inspirational call to arms.  "We will improve the world, and the
way we work, the way we communicate and live and learn as people.
I'm excited about that," he said.  "That's why as much as I've
talked to you today about various phases of computing, I also
wanted to emphasize that we must now also pass into a new phase
as an industry.

"We have grown, we have innovated, and we have prospered at a
rate unsurpassed by any other.  It's been an amazing,
breathtaking ride.  It can continue -- and accelerate -- if we
remember that our future rests on how well we respond to the
total needs of society and of our customers all around the
world."

Multimedia Partnering:  A Clash of Cultures

By Harrison M. Rose
SENIOR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR -- WEST COAST

In the November issue of Multimedia Monitor, this column focused
on raising money for multimedia production and development
(Monitor 11/95 p16).  This month, we will discuss multimedia
partnerships, with an emphasis on the people part of the
equation.

One way of looking at multimedia is through the convergence of
digital technology development and creative media development.
With this convergence comes the cultural clashes of language,
thought processes, deal making, and, especially, ego.  Many
multimedia industry participants are aware of the differences
arising from the conflicting methods of doing business, but the
conflicts of goals and ideals can be just as big a problem.
Though these problems are always there, the enthusiasm and spirit
of the entrepreneurial effort will often mask them, hiding them
from view -- only to have them come out to the deal-killing
foreground right when the legal groundwork is being laid to make
the deal real.  Avoiding the legal issues only make matters worse
in the long run, and trying to deal with the matters right up
front can destroy the project by souring the creative juices.

There is no easy time to get it right, especially when the
partners are in a rush to bring the project together.  If the pot
is big enough, and all of the necessary team members have enough
shared vision to either set their egos aside or to invest their
egos in the project, then the project has a good chance to
succeed.  However, often team members' personal goals are not
aligned with the project's goals.  This divergence becomes
critical when the misalignment is over the long-term purpose of
the venture -- is this to be an on-going business, or is this a
one-time project that may lead to additional projects in the
future?

The creative teams that produce intellectual property in the
movie business have a long history of "being virtual."  Many will
go from project to project together, adding value from their
history of working together, but there is no long-term commitment
to building added value.  In the software industry, only contract
programmers work to build such commitments.  Many executives,
marketers, and software developers (who prefer employment
positions over consulting contracts) see themselves in the
business of creating living products.  While most media-based
entertainment producers expect their participation to end once
the product ships (with the exception of public relations and
some marketing activity), software developers build products
expecting them to require after market service and support.
While entertainment producers may license previously existing
media (e.g., movie rights for a published book) or produce
sequels, software developers constantly build the new production
from scratch -- leveraging previously developed code, concepts,
or technologies.

Some entertainment producers, such as television producers or
magazine publishers, amortize creative costs over a series of
related story-line products.  With TV series, for example, major
sets will support several episodes, possibly the whole series,
like Star Trek:  Voyager.  Currently, multimedia titles do not
have available audiences the size of a television show or motion
picture.  Therefore, amortizing creative costs over a series of
CD-ROM titles is not currently in vogue.  In time, it will
probably come to be so.  The size of the installed base for the
CD-ROM and Internet markets (and maybe in several years,
Interactive TV) will grow to allow the cost-benefit equation to
fit the new creative medium.

Multimedia developers, especially ones seeking venture capital
funding, will often amortize the cost of the technology engine
over several proposed titles, while traditional film and video
producers build the technology for one-time usage and therefore
account for it on a cost basis.  Besides the accounting issue,
herein lies an obvious strategic-level conflict:  Software
developers need to plan for multiple titles, while entertainment
producers plan single titles.

On 8 November 1995, the Los Angeles, California-based law firm of
Irell & Manella, which specializes in "high
technology/multimedia/intellectual property law," held a seminar
in Menlo Park, California on Building Multimedia Alliances and
Making Them Work.  (Call them at 310/277-1010 for future
seminars.) Partners Roger Steinberg, Lois J.  Scali, and Theodore
E.  Guth, used a hypothetical situation to demonstrate the four
major recurring issues that groups face when negotiating an
alliance, whether formulating a single project or a new business:
exclusivity, termination, compensation, and control.  "Timing" is
a fifth and separate issue.

"Exclusivity" refers to the issue of deciding who may work for
others.  For example, take a record company entering into an
alliance with a multimedia developer.  To what extent can the
multimedia developer produce competitive products for other
record companies? On the other side, can the record company use
other multimedia developers? Another aspect of this issue,
especially seen here in the Silicon Valley and other high
technology centers, is the issue of time.  How much of the time
and staff will each devote to the venture? Creative media
producers often will have many projects going at the same time.
Software developers, who devote significant thought and effort to
any given project, will commonly work on only one project at a
time.  A software development executive may have several teams
working on several projects, but rarely will the hands-on
software folk work on several projects at the same time.

Another view of exclusivity is commitment.  If the principals of
a new start-up are not willing to be essentially exclusive to the
start-up, potential financial backers will flee.  They will tell
you, "Why should I put money into something of yours that you are
not committed to?" It appears that many members of the creative
media production community don't understand this concept, since
they have the experience of successfully raising funds for
individual projects.  This cultural conflict of focus can kill a
deal, as well, especially one that is attempting to raise venture
capital.  Because the market size in the multimedia universe is
substantially smaller, the risk is greater and the potential
return on investment more difficult to project.

With "termination" comes all the attending issues of dividing the
revenue streams, equity, and derivative values.  Who owns the
intellectual property, especially the new derivative product? If
there is a split-up, how do the parties divide the residual
revenues? What are the circumstances by which one person can walk
and start another business? Sometimes things don't work out
because constraints keep one partner from unexpected
opportunities.  For example, What if Disney offers your creative
partner an unbelievably rich opportunity? How could she say,
"No?" More to the point, why should she say, "No?"

"Compensation" covers the whole set of issues of who puts in the
money; how do they get recovery; how are the risks distributed;
and what are the relative values of intellectual property,
contacts, and abilities? When it is difficult to project
revenues, as happens with multimedia content products,
negotiating the revenue split becomes a problem.  Once you choose
the method of dividing income (which may have the initial revenue
going to pay back the investor), then control of costs becomes an
issue.  A project may generate subsequent value for the
multimedia developer's business that the partners feel should
benefit all partners.  As Steinberg says, "If the alliance is a
joint venture, there is always spill-over from the good will
created by the joint venture to the individual companies.  For
example, a multimedia developer getting more independent work
based on the joint venture, could pay royalty to the joint
venture or other partners."

When determining relative values contributed by the founders of a
new venture, it is relatively unimportant who came up with the
initial idea.  You have to ask what team you need to make the
venture fly, and recruit the missing members through equity and
other incentives.  To work out all of these issues, the proposed
team members need to engage in much dialog.  Theodore Guth
observes, "You often have to make a lot of these decisions before
you know the result."

When the joint venture is between existing companies, more
complex solutions are proposed.  "Complex solutions have their
own costs," Guth adds.  "Most end up with a 50-50 solution."  One
of the most difficult problems, however, is that, "models and
language between software and entertainment [companies] are very
different.  You have to listen to their language in their
context.  However," notes Guth, "these complex models help
minimize the risk.  The complexity rises as you deal with larger
companies."

An important reality check before initiating one of these
projects is the budget.  Ask the partners, "Do you realize how
many units you have to sell to provide a break-even?" Good
distribution is a necessity, because it is critical to the
success of the venture.  When the average price of a title drops,
the margins are hit hard.  If neither partner brings distribution
to the venture, then the venture has to establish a channel --
which can be very expensive and difficult to accomplish.

"Control" is the big bugaboo!  No matter how well the people get
along, there needs to be a designated method for tie-breaking.
Sometimes, it is a definition of who makes what kinds of
decisions.  Sometimes, it is a designated outside board member
who sits in as arbitrator.  If the team members' visions are in
competition, then there will be conflict.  In multimedia, "you
are making decisions with people that you don't have twenty years
of experience with," points out Ms.  Scali.  "Don't get too
quickly to a form, business model, relationships, etc., before
forming the corporation."

This is especially true when bargaining with larger partners,
such as between a small multimedia development group and a large
record producer.  According to the attorneys from Irell &
Manella, "The general perception when a break up occurs is
negative to the small company, regardless of reason.  Bargaining
power for the little company declines over time as you approach
the crisis point of effectiveness."  This is an important point -
- don't believe you are irreplaceable.

The issue of "timing" is a general issue for all alliances, joint
ventures, and business development.  Who do you bring in, at what
point, and at what cost? As the project advances, the variables
change values.  For example, a major challenge that often causes
alliances problems over time is that people often forget that
alliances need to be maintained.  As Guth puts it, "Like a
marriage, there is a lot of work that goes into maintaining an
alliance.  What are the pressures your champion faces within the
organization?" He strongly recommends periodically reflecting on
what's happening with your alliance partner.  Check your contract
regularly to see how it applies as your business and the alliance
develop and change over time.

As a profound example, consider the recent events at Kaleida (as
reported in last month's Multimedia Monitor).  Calliope Media's
CEO Jay Haifitz told me in response to the impending shut down,
"The announcement came as a complete shock.  Some people like
surprises, and I'm not one of them.  This was not a good
surprise."  In fact, Calliope Media was quite embarrassed by it.
When the announcement came, the company was at Comdex
demonstrating the first consumer title to be based on ScriptX.
"We were in a booth beating a drum very loudly," Haifitz recalls.

The attorneys from Irell & Manella point out, "The tension you
have between the two models, Hollywood versus Silicon Valley, is
absolutely real.  You need to ask the right questions and use the
same language."  They continue, "You can satisfy missing needs
with additional alliances.  There has to be a fundamental buying
into a common vision to make it work.  Otherwise, it could end up
with one person being the company and the other being a
consultant."

As a real world example of how difficult these issues really are,
consider a recent business deal I was trying to put together with
a highly talented group of movie makers who moved to the Silicon
Valley.  They had outlined a series of projects that had little
cohesion, while expressing the desire to build a digital studio
with long-term value goals.  I saw this as an opportunity to
marry several technologies and create a "21st century
entertainment company" that could produce digital interactive and
linear product for multiple distribution channels with inter-
channel leverage.  Several of their planned productions could be
dovetailed with a little planning.  They agreed, and we started
working together.  I began to pull the technical and business
teams together.  Suddenly, the deal hit a major road bump,
because of a cultural conflict.

In this case, the cultural conflict was essentially a question of
control.  These movie makers had left Hollywood to gain control
over the creative process and feared the possible control that a
CEO and board of directors would have over them.  By using a
creative organizational structure, I thought we had solved this
issue, only to have it resurface when they sought legal advice
about the structure -- without me.  The legal advice they
received caused them to collapse the structure and, hence, the
deal.

Attorneys will give you advice based upon the information that
you give them.  If they do not have all the information -- which
they never do -- their advice will reflect this knowledge gap.
Lawyers rarely ask about the underlying issues.  This is
especially true during a preliminary information meeting, since
the attorney is trying to win you as a client at this point.
When you seek legal counsel about setting up a partnership or new
corporate structure, all parties should be present.  You should
have separate counsel, as well, to represent your own interests.
Remember, if the deal is killed, then there are no interests to
protect.

During the formative period, conflicts between partners or team
members will occur.  One of the parties -- preferably the team's
leader -- should have the training or ability to negotiate and
settle conflicts by raising the actual issues out of the muck and
mire of the specific circumstances.  (I recommend the classic
Getting To Yes by Roger Fisher, published by Houghton Mifflin, if
this technique if it is new to you.) People make the business --
and multimedia requires many kinds of people.  The process is
very difficult -- but, potentially, very rewarding.

multimedia and Web development tools presented at MacWorld.

3DO Reports Second Quarter Results

The 3DO Company reported that for the second quarter ended 30
September 1995, it had a net loss of $8.8 million, or ($0.34) per
share, against a loss of $12.8 million, or ($0.55) per share, for
the same period one year ago.  Revenue in the quarter rose 42
percent to $7.1 million from $5 million last year.  Publishing
revenues rose more than fivefold in the second quarter to $2.7
million -- up from $500,000 in the second quarter of last year.
Meanwhile, royalties and pressing fees roses to $2.8 million from
$2.3 million.

``We're feeling pretty good these days,'' said Trip Hawkins (3DO
chairman and chief executive officer).  "... The big increase in
revenues should continue in the current quarter.'' Hawkins said
he expects 3DO to turn a profit in its fourth fiscal quarter
ending March 1996, but does not expect a full year profit before
fiscal 1997, which begins in April (600 Galveston Drive, Redwood
City CA 94063-4746, 415/261-2792).

Study Shows Apple's Worldwide Market Share is Up

According to Dataquest Inc.'s preliminary results for the third
calendar quarter of 1995, Apple Computer Inc.'s worldwide market
share rose to 9.0 percent -- up from 7.4 percent in the second
calendar quarter of 1995.  Compaq, with a worldwide market share
of 10.5 percent, still holds the lead.  Dataquest cited healthy
US sales and Apple's continued strength in the education and
consumer markets as factors influencing the company's increased
market share.

"These findings illustrate the vitality of the Macintosh platform
around the world," said Michael Spindler (president of Apple).
"Clearly, our strategic focus on key customer segments is
increasing customer acceptance, and helping us achieve our
desired goal of overall increased market share" (Apple, Lynne
Keast, One Infinite Loop, Cupertino CA 95014, 408/974-5431;
Dataquest, 408/437-8000).

Hall Dickler Forecasts Says Internet Lawsuits Inevitable

In its annual ADLAW Forecast, Hall Dickler Kent Friedman & Wood
offers some predictions for advertisers and the Internet in 1996:

Calling cyberspace "a virtual free for all," Doug Wood (Hall
Dickler executive partner) said that "reckless abandon will cause
a plethora of lawsuits in 1996."  In the rush to create a Web
presence, more and more agencies and advertisers will be faced
with lawsuits over copyright and trademark infringement, privacy
rights, and union talent claims, predicts Hall Dickler.
"Agencies and advertisers are simply not exercising their usual
restraint," said Wood.  "Many are ignoring third-party rights as
they enter cyberspace."

Wood also predicted that 1996 will see the first major libel case
against an advertiser or an advertising agency for its billboard
or "chat" locations.  "Unlike Prodigy and Compuserve, which both
had novel defenses as publishers and common carriers in recent
cases, those same defenses will fail in an action against an
advertiser or agency," said Wood.

The Hall Dickler forecast also suggests that as the Web explodes,
the big online services will make major attempts to control more
pages and domains in order to prevent opening competition to
independent server providers.  "Antitrust lawsuits and
investigations will spring up in reaction to brutal competition
and business failures by independents," according the report (909
3rd Avenue, New York NY 10022-4731, 212/339-5400).

IDC/LINK Says International Market Hot for Home PCs

In its Global New Media Consumer Survey, IDC/LINK said that by
the end of 1995, consumer PC shipments to Europe, Asia, and
Pacific Rim were expected to outpace shipments to the US by 34
percent ($22 billion versus $16 billion).  By the year 2000,
consumers in international markets are forecast to spend more
than $48 billion on home PCs, exceeding by 78 percent US
estimated expenditures of $27 billion, according to the report.

The Global New Media Consumer Survey also notes that 20.4 million
households in the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific Rim
owned multiple PCs in 1995 -- a figure IDC/LINK expects will more
than double to 50 million households by the year 2000.
Additionally, repeat buyers are more likely to purchase the same
brand as their current PC.

The Global New Media Consumer Survey was based on primary
research gathered through telephone and in-home interviews with
more than 15,000 households in the United States, France,
Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, China, Hong Kong, India,
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan (Suite 1420, 2 Park
Avenue, New York NY 10016, 212/726-0900).

Consumer CD-ROM Titles in Print Up 93 Percent in 1995, Says
InfoTech

According to its year-end survey of the CD-ROM industry, InfoTech
reports that consumer CD-ROM titles in print grew from 2,032 in
1994 to 3,919 in 1995 -- an increase of 93 percent.  However,
retail shelf space increased just 24 percent over 1994.  With the
majority of US retailers stocking just slightly more than 250
titles, few of thousands of titles in print get any significant
US retail distribution.  According to InfoTech president Julie
Schwerin, it is the "established publishers with a track record
of hit titles and captive distribution arms" that attain the
breadth of distribution necessary for success.

The average shelf life of consumer CD-ROM titles has decreased
from 130 in 1994 to 102 in 1995; the shelf life of titles in the
highly competitive games category can be considerably shorter.
"A new title must sell-through strongly immediately at launch,"
said Schwerin.  "If not, there are 15 other titles waiting to
take its place."  This strong competition also has contributed to
a 21 percent decline in retail weighted average selling prices
for consumer titles.

Nevertheless, publishers remain "enthusiastic," according to
InfoTech, which predicts an increase of 42 percent in the number
of titles in print during 1996 (against a 20 to 25 percent growth
rate in the retail channel).  "As the industry consolidates and
product lines are rationalized, we expect the rate of growth in
titles in print to slow to around 30 percent in 1997," said
Schwerin (Box 150, Skyline Drive, Woodstock VT 05091, 802/763-
2097, fax 802/763-2098).

Zona Says Consumer Potential of Internet Over-Hyped

In its new study entitled Internet vs.  Intranet:  Markets,
Opportunities, and Trends, Zona Research Inc.  says the golden
opportunity for Internet technologies lies not in consumer-
oriented commerce across the 'Net, but in applying Internet
technologies within organizations:  "The Intranet."

"Based on our surveys and analysis of Internet domain
distribution, online service customers, and other available
surveys, we conclude that the prospects for commercial consumer
use of the Internet are vastly overstated," said Stephen Auditore
(president, Zona).  In fact, Zona estimates that there are less
than six million commercial online service subscribers who even
possess the connectivity underlying technology to use the World
Wide Web.  "The notion of tens of millions of consumers jumping
online, exercising their purchase prerogative, is grossly over-
hyped," Auditore said.

"The real market potential for Intranet technology -- servers,
browsers, indexers, retrieval and authoring systems, and other
related technologies," said Auditore, "will exceed $400 million
for 1995."  With more than 15 million users who have an
infrastructure in place allowing them to use the World Wide Web,
organizations and enterprises will be able to more easily
quantify the benefits associated with using Internet technologies
for internal communication and productivity enhancements, Zona
contends.  Internet vs.  Intranet:  Markets, Opportunities and
Trends is 170+ plus pages and is priced at $895 (Suite 102A, 497
Seaport Court, Redwood City CA 94063, 415/568-5700, fax 415/306-
