<H2>Welcome to the Center for Industrial Technology Systems</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<B>MISSION</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Industrial Technology Systems acts as a national resource in supporting the missions of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and private industry.  The Center is strongly committed to DOE's Office of Industrial Technology (OIT) in transferring clean, efficient energy technologies into the marketplace to benefit U.S. companies, federal government customers, and the general public.  To leverage its resources, the Center partners with various Argonne divisions, other national laboratories, industry, universities, not-for-profit organizations, and others.
<P>
For efficient and effective operation, the Center is divided into three sections:
<P>
<P>
<B>INDUSTRIAL AND UTILITY TECHNOLOGY</B>
<P>
The Industrial and Utility Technology section focuses on the development and application of cost-effective process, environmental, and power generation technologies for the industrial process and utility industries.  In addition, this section is providing planning support for two DOE "Vision of the Future" programs:  Refinery of the Future and Forest Products Industry of the Future.  The section's core activities center around process industry technology; pollution prevention and control; utility technologies and systems; and analysis, simulation, and modeling.  Effort has been organized in this manner to respond to DOE's and other sponsoring agencies' desire to work more closely with U.S. industry in the development and commercialization of technologies and to take optimal advantage of the technical expertise of the section's staff.  This expertise is concentrated in chemical and mechanical engineering, with a strong emphasis on chemical processes, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, thermodynamic processes, and combustion and emissions measurements and control.
<P>
<P>
Key projects include the Refinery of the Future advanced environmental control technology, carbon disulfide removal from viscose plant emissions, CO2 capture/utilization/disposal, and industrial cogeneration.
<P>
<P>
<B>PROCESS EVALUATION</B>
<P>
The Process Evaluation section conducts applied research and technical and economic analysis of innovative technologies for industrial applications.  It develops cost-effective technologies for waste minimization/utilization applications, with an emphasis on materials recycling.  Technical, economic, and market analyses of advanced energy and environmental technologies help determine technology R&D requirements and commercialization potential.  The section works closely with  large-scale industries and industry-supported associations.  Core activities include development of physical/chemical separation processes and metallurgical processes, process simulation and cost analysis, and process control and sensor development.
<P>
<P>
Representative projects include electrochemical dezincing of galvanized ferrous scrap, selective removal of antimony from aluminum scrap, recovery of materials from auto shredder residue and aluminum salt cakes, evaluation of the process for recovery/recycling of rocket motor chemicals, and development of electrocatalytic gas microsensor technology.
<P>
<P>
<B>WASTE MANAGEMENT AND BIOENGINEERING</B>
<P>
The Waste Management and Bioengineering section applies physical, chemical, and biological processes to solve real-world problems for industry and government in a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable manner.  This section has aggressively pursued individual-company industrial collaborators for all projects.  Major environmental issues being addressed include development of "green" chemicals from biobased materials and development of remediation technology.  Core activities include membrane separations, remediation, environmental biotechnologies, and gas and oil industry technologies.
<P>
<P>
Key projects include implementing an alternative feedstocks program, bioconverting high-starch food wastes into high-value products, minimizing use of chemicals in gas/oil operations, removing salts from produced waters, undertaking a landfill gas program, cleaning textile parts with sonication, removing salts from reactive dye solutions, and designing and using foams to remediate non-aqueous-phase liquids.<BR>
