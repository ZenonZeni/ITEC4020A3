<B>We are excited to announce that the All American Made Products Exhibition
U.S. EXPO '97 will be held on March 17-21, 1997 in Amman, Jordan. The expo
is certain to be the focal point for buyers and distributors throughout the
Middle East and Arab Gulf States. Encompassing an area whose market value
has risen to over $33.3 billion annually, the Middle East and Gulf States
have become one the major areas for business opportunities in the world today.
Indeed the buyers at the expo will represent the fastest growing economic
region in the world.</B>
<P>
<B>The Kingdom of Jordan is strategically positioned as a gateway to the
rest of the Middle East. Its economic stability, security and strategic location
put Jordan in an ideal position as a commercial, communication and industrial
platform. In addition, with its three free zones, the Amman market offers
a connection to trade throughout the region. All these factors indicate a
great market potential that cannot be ignored. The expo serves as an excellent
opportunity for American manufacturers to promote their products for export
in the Middle East.</B>
<P>
<B>This event has been organized by U.S. EXPO '97, an American company based
in California with a branch in Jordan, in conjunction with a long established
Jordanian exhibition company. A large number of professional buyers from
across the Middle East will be visiting the expo, and an extensive media
campaign will be run throughout the countries of the region. The buying capacity
has a market of 10,000 companies requiring new consumer products and modern
technology, so the demand for American goods is large. </B>
<P>
<B>The Amman International Expo Center is located on the main highway towards
the Jordan International Airport. With a total area of 76,000 feet, the center
offers a full range of interior and exterior facilities, as well as parking
for over 1000 cars. 300 booth spaces will be sold for the event. The Expo
Center is only minutes way from all major services, including banks, hotels,
restaurants, communications, trade and advisory institutions, and transportation.
</B>
<P>
<B>Opening ceremonies will commence at 11 AM on March 17, 1997, at the Amman
International Expo Center under the patronage of His Majesty King Hussein.
The Minister of Business Development and Trade, ambassadors, trade counselors,
government officials and leading members of the Middle East business community
will also be in attendance. </B>
