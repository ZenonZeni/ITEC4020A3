COTS SYSTEMS MAY REPLACE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS IN BOSNIA

     U.S. military leaders are drafting a proposal to replace some of
their communications assets in Bosnia with commercial-off-the-shelf
equipment and services so crucial military resources can be freed up
for other potential operations, according to a senior American
military planner in Europe.
     "We would like to put more commercial equipment in place in order
to withdraw some of our tactical [communications] assets," Air Force
Brig. Gen. Buford "Randy" Witt, the U.S. European Command's director
of command, control, communications, and computer systems, told C4I
NEWS in a Jan. 8 telephone interview from Stuttgart, Germany. "We
would like to replace some units before the year is up."
      Equipment likely to be replaced by commercial industry includes
systems that offer long-haul connectivity between various
communications centers and computer terminals and networks, Witt said.
      NATO and Pentagon approval would then be necessary to go forward
with the effort. Funding will also have to be identified to support
contract awards.   
      The concept is driven by the fact that U.S. forces, while only
making up one-third of the 60,000 NATO peacekeepers, are providing the
bulk of the communications apparatus in Bosnia. And Witt contends that
at some point during the course of the year-long operation, those
assets may be required to support operations elsewhere. 
      "We are the only armed forces with enough equipment to do this,"
he said. "Only a few nations have satellite communications equipment
and assets. The U.S. is certainly the most dominant player. We have
the most infrastructure in place from a tactical standpoint."
      And much of EUCOM's communications assets have been supporting
operations in Bosnia for some time. Before the introduction of U.S.
ground troops in December, the U.S.'s communications infrastructure
was supporting United Nations peacekeepers in the region and was later
tailored for a possible U.S. intervention to withdraw those troops
should they be placed in jeopardy. That infrastructure is now
supporting U.S. and NATO troops on the ground, at sea, and in the air.
      "We have tied up a huge resource with this deployment," Witt
added. "I want to replace some of our military gear so that equipment
can be used elsewhere."
      Bringing in private contractors to alleviate the communications
burden placed on U.S. forces in Bosnia is not an entirely new idea.
Some commercial firms are already playing a part in supporting
Operation Joint Endeavor. 
      For example, the U.S. is already leasing bandwidth on the
commercial satellites of some Southeastern European countries and
plans to lease more as the operation progresses. Also, EUCOM plans to
award a contract in the near future for commercial telephone service
in-theater.
      "There are some [from the private sector] working for [EUCOM],
but they are not huge efforts," Witt said.  
      Before contracts would be awarded and commercial equipment
brought in to replace some of the military assets in Bosnia, Witt and
others must first ensure all necessary communications support is in
place.  
      Witt estimates that roughly 60 percent of the communications
equipment required to support the operation is Bosnia is in theater
and up and running, most notably high-frequency satellite links. "But
we're still deploying equipment," he said. "NATO said the total
deployment of [60,000] troops will take 60 days. The skeleton is down,
but the operating forces are just getting started. The remaining 40
percent will be for units in the field."

U.S. WANTS DBS DEMO IN BOSNIA

     U.S. commanders are anxiously awaiting the introduction of the
Direct Broadcast System (DBS) into Bosnia, hoping that its ability to
transmit large pieces of voice and video  communications will enhance
the C4I picture of Operation Joint Endeavor.
     The Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Defense Information
Systems Agency have received Pentagon approval to pursue DBS as part
of an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD), with Bosnia as
a potential laboratory, according to Air Force Brig. Gen. Buford
"Randy" Witt, the European Command's director of command, control,
communications, and computers systems. 
     DBS would rely on commercial communications satellites to
transmit scores of information to warfighters on the ground and at
sea. 
     The Navy is currently pursuing such a capability--called the
Global Broadcast System--but a DBS ACTD "offers the potential of
fuzing [the system] into the force more rapidly," Witt said in an
interview with C4I NEWS. 
     The desire for DBS "is driven by the need to better manage and
move information to people in the field, rather than headquarters,"
Witt said. Its application in Bosnia "is more than promising."
     Before the ACTD gets going, however, DoD must identify additional
resources, Witt added.

IMPROVED TARGETING COULD SAVE DOD MILLIONS, ANALYSIS SUGGESTS       

      By improving the ability of military forces to locate and
identify enemy targets the Defense Department could drastically
improve attack operations while allowing it to scale back plans for
expensive buys of precision munitions and high performance aircraft,
Air Force officials have learned from a recent analysis.
      A cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA) recently
completed for the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System
(Joint STARS) has led service officials to conclude the Pentagon would
be wise to pursue more systems like the Northrop Grumman-developed
long-range, air-to-ground surveillance and battle management system. 
      By investing in such advanced sensors, operations such as bombing
sorties could be significantly improved and much-needed dollars saved
over the long term by leveraging more information rather than more
hardware, Air Force officials believe.
      
  ...Results May Boost C2 Investment

      "The results say improve target acquisition," an Air Force
official said of the COEA. "In other words, if [Joint STARS] gives a
quantum improvement [in lethality], it's natural to assume in other
sensor areas it would be the same."
      "This [analysis] might have a significant affect on command and
control investment in the future," the official said.
      Joint STARS provides commanders with real-time information on the
whereabouts of enemy ground targets. The system is currently
completing its operational test and evaluation while deployed in
support of the NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia (Defense Daily,
Dec. 22, 1995). 
      Joint STARS consists of a modified Boeing E-8 aircraft and
ground-based terminals and is slated for full rate production in FY
'96.
      The COEA results suggest that improvements in DoD's command and
control architecture can introduce as equal an improvement in
lethality as new precision munitions and aircraft, service officials
said.
      Moreover, if Air Force fighters can destroy an enemy target with
two "shots" instead of four, for example, some aircraft can be freed
up to kill additional targets, one service official observed. In other
words, "the current [Air Force] force structure is adequate, and we
don't have to buy more [fighters]" if the right investments are made,
the official said.
      "We don't need 40 fighter wings, but need to invest more in our
architecture."

PENTAGON RESTORES MOST OF ARMY'S SINCGARS FUNDING       

     Late last month the Pentagon's leadership heeded the Army's cries
over the past few months and agreed to restore nearly all of the
service's funding request for the Single Channel Ground and Airborne
Radio System (SINCGARS) in the next two fiscal years, according to DoD
officials and budget documents.
        The service is now set to accelerate fielding of an improved
version of the primary tactical radio system and believes it can
retain two prime contractors and continue to keep costs down. General
Dynamics and ITT  compete annually for SINCGARS production and are
both working on the SINCGARS System Improvement Program (SIP).
        In early December, Deputy Defense Secretary John White restored
the $92.8 million in FY '97 money DoD Comptroller John Hamre
recommended be cut last November. However, until last week, the Army
was set to lose all of its $298 million request for FY '98.
        In program budget decision (PBD) 731 on Dec. 28, White restored
$267.9 million in FY '98, $30 million less than the Army was looking
for. The decision came after continued Army assertions that the FY '98
cut would put the program and force readiness in jeopardy.
        Although the Army won't be able to buy as many radios in FY '98
as originally intended, service officials are confident the program is
out of the woods.                      
        "We see that as a pretty fair cut," an Army budget official
said of the $30 million FY '98 decrement. "We made our case and got
most of what we asked for." 
        Budget requests are made for two fiscal years at once, but
Congress appropriates funding for only one year at a time. This year
the Pentagon is at a disadvantage going into its final budget
deliberations because without a federal budget for FY '96 it lacks a
funding baseline for FY '97 to work against. Without a federal budget
soon, the FY '97 request will likely be delayed beyond the statutory
deadline for being submitted to Congress. 
        The comptroller's original recommendation to cut FY '97 and FY
'98 SINCGARS money was based on the belief that the Army planned to
use the resources to outfit the National Guard with the primary
command and control system used by infantry, armor, artillery and
aviation units. But, the argument went, the National Guard has no
warfighting mission, does not require SINCGARS, and should make do
with its older VRC-12 series radios.
        But the Army, in an appeal to Hamre's recommendations in
November, said it plans to field the SINCGARS SIP radio to first-to-
fight units and that the National Guard will benefit only by receiving
those SINCGARS already fielded and set to be replaced by the SIP
radios. The appeal by Neil Ginnetti, principal deputy assistant
secretary of the Army, prompted White to approve the FY '97 request in
December. But the Army's continued fight led to White's decision last
week to approve FY '98 funding as well.
        Last fall the Army decided to accelerate the SINCGARS program
in an effort to field the required 225,000 radios as quickly as
possible and save nearly $500 million over the future years defense
plan by buying out the program in three years instead of eight. The
Army plans to apply those cost savings to other areas.
        The accelerated plan calls for $283 million in FY '97, $298
million in FY '98, and $15 million in FY '99 and FY '00, according to
internal Army documents.

TRW NABS DESKTOP TELECONFERENCING CONTRACT

        TRW's  attempts at applying its commercial technologies to
military needs is continuing to pay off, with the company announcing
its receipt of a contract award last week from the Army Communications
and Electronics Command for a desktop video teleconferencing system
(DVTS).
        The five-year, $11.4 million contract will allow DoD personnel
throughout the world to conduct "face to face" meetings without
leaving their offices, the company in a statement.
        Commercial off-the-shelf equipment upgrades will be installed
on existing Army computers, providing state-of-the-art performance at
a significant cost savings. The system also promises to save time and
money by reducing the need 
for military officials to travel to meetings.
        "This contract represents the largest single commitment of any
agency to make desktop video teleconferencing an integral part of the
workplace's communications backbone, said Fred Reinhardt, TRW program
manager. "The Army's vision for this system is the scaffolding to the
future, in terms of meeting our military's challenge to do more with
less."
        DVTS is a spin-off from an inventory control program TRW was
asked to do for the Air Force's B-2 bomber effort, according to a
company official. 
        The company official said TRW is currently negotiating with the
other military services for the introduction of DVTS. One in
particular is interested in the system for its telemedicine
capabilities, he said.
        TRW is teamed with AT&T on the Army contract and lower tier
partners will provide other services.
        Initial installation has already begun and will continue
through 1997, with options to extend installation another year.
Maintenance support will be performed during the remaining three years
of the contract.

IN BATTLE FOR SCARCE DOLLARS, C4I EMERGING AS HEAVYWEIGHT

     With the Soviet threat fading into memory, a quick glance at how
the United States has changed its national security posture over the
past six years leaves little doubt that domestic concerns increasingly
command the attention of American leaders and any attempt at
justifying the bloated defense budgets of yore would be viewed as an
effort in futility.
      But from a closer look at how America goes about the business of
defending itself these days emerges the maxim that "the more you know
the better." And despite what threats may arise, the Clinton White
House and the Republican-led Congress appear to agree at least on one
thing: that U.S. military forces must be equipped with the latest
advances in communications technologies to ensure they remain relevant
in international security affairs.
      In fact, spending on command, control, communications, computers,
and intelligence (C4I) programs is one of a few areas of the defense
budget that has remained stable over the past few years and is even
expected to grow in real terms, defense experts tell C4I News John
Pike, a defense analyst with the Federation of American Scientists,
believes overall defense spending will fall victim to the budget ax as
more and more discretionary spending is identified to balance the
federal budget. 
      But C4I programs "will probably be less affected in the sense
that if you look around DoD and ask yourself which programs have a
story to tell and are telling it well, the answer is C4I," Pike said.
In other words, "it's not that hard to make the case as to why these
programs are important." 
      All the military services are involved in highly visible attempts
at folding advanced communications technology into their warfighting
plans. For example there are Army's battlefield digitization effort,
or Force XXI, the Navy's "Copernicus Forward" plan, and the Joint
Staff-sponsored "C4I for the Warrior" philosophy.
      "I can't think of any program that has that type of explanation
going on," Pike said. "There are more slogans than all other DoD
programs put together."  
      "All things considered, C4I programs are in reasonably good
shape" as future defense budgets are formulated, Pike said.
      Besides, numerous sources have pointed out, C4I programs are not
politically controversial as funding for the Air Force's B-2 bomber
and missile defense spending.           
      Steve Olson of Hughes Aircraft , who heads the Electronics
Industries Association's annual 10-year forecast of defense spending,
believes the C4I market will remain "relatively flat" in the near
future, "but the government will buy more C4I stuff than it ever has
before."
      Olson believes spending in this area may not increase in real
terms in large part because the military services are relying on more
and more commercial products and systems to meet their needs, thus
keeping costs down. "They will be paying less for more," he said.
      Olson contends that small, rather than big ticket items will be a
Pentagon focus in information systems acquisition and spending on the
operation and maintenance of such systems will also increase. Systems
which enhance the ability of the services to communicate with each
other in joint operations will also be high on the Pentagon's priority
list, he believes.
      But despite what programs budget officials and analyst believe
C4I money should be spent on, it's clear that the interests of defense
companies lies in the investment in information technologies.
      "The overall budget will fall but C4I will, in proportion, remain
stable because the technology revolution necessitates maintaining that
spending level," Tom Moore, a defense analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, contends. "In general, C4I spending will probably remain
constant."                        
      "I don't know anybody that would object to" such spending, added
former Pentagon official and Brookings Institution analyst Larry Korb.

C4I DRIVES BUYOUTS, ANALYST SAYS

     The recent spate of defense industry consolidations demonstrates
the widespread belief that C4I spending is on firm footing in a period
of reduced defense budgets, according to a leading market analyst.
     According to James Schwendenger, of Los Angeles-based Deloitte &
Touche Consulting Group, the decisions by Lockheed Martin to purchase
Loral's  defense business and Northrop Grumman's  expected buyout of
Westinghouse's  defense and electronics division were driven in part
by the desire to cement a position in the C4I and defense electronics
markets.
     Both defense giants currently have limited involvement in these
growth areas and "have been looking for an opportunity to acquire
businesses to allow them to get involved," Schwendenger told C4I NEWS
last week.
     Schwendenger estimates that Northrop Grumman's C4I business will
increase from roughly 10-15 percent to 30 percent if its acquisition
of Westinghouse goes forward. "It put them on the [C4I] map."
     Moreover, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are currently
heavily rooted in airframe production, the future of which is
uncertain. "Will Northrop Grumman make fighters in 2020?" Schwendenger
asks. "That's questionable."
     But the technology boom in communications and electronics, on the
other hand, has a bright future, he said.

SBIRS IDENTIFIED AS POSSIBLE BOSNIA BILLPAYER

    The Air Force's Space-Based Infrared    System (SBIRS) has been
identified by DoD   Comptroller John Hamre as a possible billpayer for     
U.S. operations in Bosnia. In a recision list drafted last month,
Hamre recommended Deputy Defense Secretary that John White cut $135
million in FY '96 funds from the demonstration/validation program. The
Clinton administration asked Congress for $130.7 million for SBIRS
development in FY '96, but lawmakers appropriated $230.7 million. Like
a myriad of other programs boosted by the Republican-led Congress,
SBIRS is on the table to offset what Pentagon budget officials believe
will be a more than $2 billion bill for the U.S. peacekeeping effort.

JWID '95 GUIDE TO BEST COMMUNICATIONS IN BOSNIA

    Pentagon leaders holding discussions on how to best outfit U.S.
forces in Bosnia with communications systems are using the results of
the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration '95--held last fall--
to identify the best solution, according to DoD officials. Due to the
impressive performance during the exercise, Pentagon leaders are
considering deploying several emerging communications to the Balkans.
Candidates for Bosnia use include he Global Command and Control
System, the Collaborative Contingency Targeting system, which will
help solve targeting problems encountered by pilots, the
Communications on Operational Modeling, Planning, and Simulation
Strategy, a training tool aimed at improving air mission plans, and
the Global Broadcast System.

THAAD PM CONSIDERS REPLACING JTIDS IN GROUND STATIONS

    Officials in the Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
program office would like to replace the Joint Tactical Information
Distribution System as the primary radio for the missile defense
platform's ground station, according to service officials and
documents. In its stead, they believe the Secure Packet Radio,
manufactured by ESCO Electronics subsidiary Hazeltine will provide
enough throughput to meet program requirements. Army leaders, however,
are unconvinced such a change is necessary and have asked THAAD
officials to justify their request.

CLINTON SIGNS INTELLIGENCE BILL

    President Clinton signed the FY '96 Intelligence Bill earlier this
month, providing funding for the likes of the Central Intelligence
Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, and
Defense Intelligence Agency. The bill, which is classified, is
estimated to contain just under $30 billion in budget authority.The
congressional intelligence panels have been grappling over the past
months on whether funding for NRO satellites should be shifted from
ongoing larger satellite systems to fund smaller, cheaper satellites.
Lawmakers were said to have reached a compromise on the issue in the
final bill.

    CIA Director John Deutch believes he should play a larger role in
defense intelligence matters, such as having the authority to approve
DoD intelligence appointments, and an important voice in defense
budget planning. Testifying before the House Select Committee on
Intelligence, the former deputy defense secretary also said he thinks
the creation of a director of national intelligence is unnecessary, as

FIRST MESSAGE SENT USING MILSTAR CROSSLINK ANTENNAE

    The Air Force's Milstar satellite transmitted its first message
using its crosslink antennae late last month, according to prime
contractor Lockheed Martin. The message was uplinked to Milstar
satellite one, which relayed the information to Milstar satellite two
with the crosslink antennae on the spacecraft. The transmission was
then downlinked to the U.S. Pacific Command, Camp Smith, Hawaii, and
the U.S. Atlantic Command, Norfolk, Va. It marked the first time 
a communications signal has been transmitted over such a long distance
through more than one satellite without the use of ground relay
stations.

MILITARY, COMMERCIAL SATELLITES SHOULDER LARGE BURDEN IN BOSNIA

    Space-based assets, many owned and operated by commercial entities,
are playing a vital role in the NATO peacekeeping operation in 
Bosnia, according to an Air Force official. A mixed bag of commercial
and military satellites are being used for a variety of applications,
including communications and reconnaissance, Maj. Gen. David Vesely,
commander of the 14th Air Force, told reporters last month. Heavy
demands on the military's satellites during Desert Storm demonstrated
the need for more bandwidth during large-scale operations and since
then DoD has begun to exploit the capabilities of commercial
satellites through leasing arrangements, especially for high data rate
transmissions.

KAMINSKI APPROVES TACTICAL UAV DEMONSTRATOR

    Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski in December authorized the
pursuit of a close range unmanned aerial vehicle as an advanced
concept technology demonstration (ACTD) in December, after the Army
and Navy agreed on system requirements. In a Dec. 21 memo, Kaminski
called for the demonstration of the joint tactical UAV--formerly
called Maneuver--to last 18 months, with an eventual system cost not
to exceed $300,000, and a range of 200 kilometers. The demonstration
will also include some pre-planned product improvements and be
launched from both land and sea. A draft request for proposals for the
program is expected shortly, according officials in the Navy-led Joint
Program Office.

CACI BUYS IMS

    CACI International, Inc., purchased IMS Technologies, Inc., for
$6.5 million the company said earlier this month. IMS, a management
information systems company, generates about $21 million in revenue
each year. The company specializes in re-engineering,
telecommunications, multimedia data management, mission support, and
full systems life cycle management. Clients include the Navy and
Justice Department. The buy is a good move for the company because it
will allow CACI, an information technology products company, to grow
in "synergistic, anti-dilative niche acquisitions," said CEO Jack
London.

AIR FORCE TO MERGE C4, INFO MANAGEMENT BRANCHES

    The Air Force will merge its information management branch with its
C4I branch, the service's secretary said last month. The merger is set
to take place early this year, creating a new branch called
"communications and information, Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall. A
general officer steering group recommended the two areas be merged
after a month-long series of studies and analyses. "The combination of
these disciplines into a single functional area will guarantee that
the vision the Air Force has for information dominance will be met,"
says a Dec. 29 service statement.

ARMY EXPECTED TO MAKE NTDR AWARD BY MONTH'S END

    A source selection for the Army's Near-Term Digital Radio is
expected by the end of the month, according to service and industry
officials. The Army embarked on the program last year to fill a
perceived shortfall in digital communications required by troops
participating in the first brigade-sized digitization exercise
scheduled for next year. The service is pursuing the Enhanced Position
Locating and Reporting System to outfit digitized forces, but will not
have enough to equip what is known as Force XXI.

ESC LAB HELPS FIND BOSNIA COMMUNICATIONS FIXES

    The Air Force's Electronics Systems Center has set up a Joint
Endeavor Laboratory at Hanscom, AFB, Mass., to help U.S. forces in
Bosnia ensure their command, control, communications, computers, and
intelligence systems are interoperable. "We are trying to replicate
the communications conditions that exist in Bosnia so we can find
better ways to be more responsive and helpful in working C4I issues in
Europe," said ESC Commander Lt. Gen. Charles Franklin. Lab officials
hold a teleconference with the theater commander in Bosnia every other
day.
