<P>
ASHRAE Standard 62 on Minimum Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor
Air Quality has become the 'Model' for ventilation standards in
many countries. The latest revision is currently undergoing public
review. Included is a proposed change to the specification of
ventilation rate which separately takes into account pollutant
generated from occupants and that generated from furnishings and
fittings. This is quoted at 3.0 l/s.p and 0.35 l/s.m2 of floor
area. Assuming an office occupation density of approximately 10
m2/occupant, the per occupant ventilation rate amounts to about
6.5 l/s.p and corresponds to a steady state indoor CO2 concentration
of 1000 ppm. However, in more densely occupied spaces, CO2 concentrations
of up to 2000 ppm can be expected.
<P>
For more information: Copies of the public review document are
available from Ashrae Customer Service at 800-5-Ashrae (US and
Canada) or 404 636 8400 (worldwide), Fax 404 321 5478, 1791 Tullie
Circle, NE, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA, and comments are needed by
12th December 1996.
<P>
For pilot test purposes, the draft will be available by August
15th free of charge through the ftp site at ftp.ashrae.org in

<H3>&quot;Building Ventilation:Theory and Measurement&quot;</H3>

Both David Etheridge and Mats Sandberg are well known for their
pioneering work in improving the theoretical understanding of
ventilation and air movement in buildings. This comprehensive
presentation details the knowledge they have gained during the
course of their research. It focuses on fundamentals and theory
and is therefore deeply mathematical. Topics cover mechanisms,
flow through envelope openings, mathematical models, mass transport,
mixing, momentum, buoyancy, air flow in rooms, flow through large
openings, experimental techniques for evaluating flow characteristics,
multi-zone representation of buildings, tracer gas methods for
ventilation and age of air evaluation, scale models and computational
fluid dynamics. It also considers both natural and mechanical
ventilation. This textbook represents a definitive account of
the theory and measurement of ventilation and should be suitable
for anyone who requires a good numerical outline of the topic.

<H2><A NAME="Inexpensive">Inexpensive </A>Ventilation Pre-heat
Absorbs in Excess of 60% of Solar Energy</H2>

<P>
The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
in Golden, Colorado, in conjunction with Conserval Systems Inc,
in Buffalo, NY have developed a solar collector which pre heats
incoming ventilation air by as much as 30oC. It consists of a
dark corrugated perforated sheet that is mounted several centimetres
from a sun facing wall. The dark panel absorbs solar radiation
and heats incoming air drawn through its perforations into a plenum.
Heat escaping from the building is also captured in this plenum.
Solar heat transfer has been maximised by optimising the air flow
rate, and the spacing and size of the perforations. The simplicity
of this product ensures reliability and ease of production. Above
all it does not contain any of the complexities of earlier solar
panels.
<P>
The system has been demonstrated in a wide variety of buildings.
In cold climates it takes advantage of both direct and diffuse
solar radiation to provide pre-heat, while in warm climates, especially
in developing areas, it has important applications in crop drying.
The 'Transpired Solar Collector' has been recognised by the United
States Department of Energy's, 'Energy Related Inventions Program'
as being among the top 2% of energy inventions. It also features
DOE's R&amp;D 100 award.

<H2><A NAME="Swing">'Swing' </A>Window Provides Uniform Air Flow
Rate</H2>

<P>
From Japan comes the 'Swindow'. This is a counterbalanced openable
window that responds to pressure difference, thus allowing an
almost constant air flow rate irrespective of driving force. Both
exhaust and supply versions are available. It is recommended that
supply windows are set in the lower part of opposite walls, while
exhaust windows are placed in the upper part of the same walls
(see Figure). Irrespective of the nature of the driving force
or the direction of wind, a cross flow or stack flow ventilation
pattern will be established.
