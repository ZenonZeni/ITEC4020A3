<H1>Cutting back greenhouse gases<BR>
with tradable<BR>
emissions permits</H1>
<HR>
<B>Tradable permits are a cost-efficient, market-driven approach to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.</B> A government must start by deciding how many tons of a particular gas may be 
emitted each year. It then divides this quantity up into a number of tradable emissions entitlements - 
measured, perhaps, in CO2-equivalent tons - and allocates them to individual firms. This gives each 
firm a quota of greenhouse gases that it can emit over a specified interval of time. Then the market 
takes over. Those polluters that can reduce their emissions relatively cheaply may find it profitable to 
do so and to sell their emissions permits to other firms. Those that find it expensive to cut emissions 
may find it attractive to buy extra permits. Trading would continue until all profitable trading 
opportunities had been exhausted.<P>
<B>Permits would ensure that emissions do not exceed a given level.</B> They are not as good 
as <A HREF = "fs230.html">carbon taxes</A>, however, at guaranteeing 
that the costs of abatement will be neither too large nor too small. So in choosing between the two 
main market-oriented approaches of tradable entitlements and carbon taxes , a government must 
decide whether it is more important to be certain of the quantity of reduced emissions or of the costs 
involved.<P>
<B>Tradable permits are already being used to address several other environmental 
problems.</B> For example, the US regulates <A HREF = 
"fs031.html">chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</A> with tradable emissions 
entitlements, and it is introducing a similar system to limit emissions of pollutants that cause <A 
HREF = "fs235.html">acid rain</A>. <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer</A> also includes provisions for the international trading of emissions permits, although 
no such trades have yet taken place.<P>
<B>To be successful, a permit scheme would have to be carefully designed.</B> If the rules 
governing trading are complex, or if the market for permits consists of only a few players, trading 
may not be efficient. This will also be true if trading involves substantial transaction costs. On the 
other hand, even an inefficient permits system may be a more cost-efficient way to reduce emissions 
than using most forms of regulatory control. <P>
<B>If implemented internationally, tradable permits could lead to resource transfers from rich 
countries to poor ones.</B> International trading could take place between governments as well as 
between firms. But before trading could begin, governments would have to agree on how to make the 
initial allocation of permits. One proposal calls for  allocating entitlements on an equal per-capita 
basis.1 Such an allocation would guarantee resource transfers from the North to the South because, 
having fewer greenhouse gas emissions per capita than do industrialized ones, developing countries 
would be net sellers of permits, while rich countries would be net buyers. However, it is highly 
unlikely that such an allocation would be acceptable to the rich countries. They would probably prefer 
to have no agreement at all than to make such large transfers.<P>
<B>To win broad acceptance, an international scheme for tradable permits could not allocate 
quotas on a simple per-capita basis</B>. The problem is that OECD countries have high per-capita 
emissions, the developing countries have low per-capita emissions, and the former Communist 
countries are somewhere in between. An allocation based on population would be attractive to 
developing countries, but probably unacceptable to OECD countries because it would require them to 
make huge transfers to poor countries (assuming that the agreed goal was to reduce global emissions 
on a large scale). Allocating entitlements according to a slightly more complex formula could reduce 
these transfers and ensure that every party to the agreement is better off than it would be without the 
agreement. Agreement would be far more likely if the entitlements were initially allocated according 
to a formula that reflected the different circumstances of these country groups. For example, the 
OECD could receive somewhat fewer permits than would be required for current emissions levels, 
and the poor countries a slight surplus, with the total quantity of entitlements being somewhat below 
current global emission levels. One study estimates that such an allocation would lower resource 
transfers to a fraction of current overseas development assistance.2 <P>
<B>International tradable permits could be effective even if implemented on a small scale. 
</B>Economists analysing schemes for emissions permits have usually focused on international 
agreements for making large-scale reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. But trading may 
also be effective in more limited circumstances. For example, a country facing high abatement costs 
may meet its own national target for emissions reduction by providing incentives for other countries 
with low abatement costs to undertake abatement on its behalf. Such bilateral agreements (known as 
"offsets") may involve relatively high transactions costs, but their small scale may make them easier to 
negotiate and implement, at least in the short run.<P>
