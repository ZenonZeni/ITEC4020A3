<B>PHASE 1: TO BEGIN THE PROCESS:</B>
<UL>
<li>Contact the Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), if you would like our information booklet, or review the information we have on the Internet.

<li>Call CSP to make an appointment for a consultation. This is a 4-6 hour consultation during which you meet one on one with a counselor, the attorney, and each member of our staff.  There is a $400.00 flat fee for this consultation.  ($200 for CSP and $200 for the counselor's consultation).  No documents are signed and no commitments made by either party.  This consultation gives CSP the opportunity to teach you about the reality of surrogacy  and ensures you understand surrogacy prior to your committing to signing retainers with our program.
<li>After the consult, we will provide you with our Retainer Agreements .  We request you do not retain us the same day, but take these retainers home to review the documents.  Once you are comfortable with all the legal issues, and you wish to retain CSP, the next step would be to  sign and mail the Retainer Agreements along with the retainer fees.

<B>PHASE 2: THE MATCHING PROCESS:</B>

<UL>
<li>There is usually a waiting period between the time a couple retains CSP and when a couple selects their surrogate mother. (although it varies, 3-8 months is average, depending upon which program you enter, and your criteria.  We will keep you informed of the current wait period).  During this waiting period, CSP is processing surrogate mothers through the program (psychological and medical screening, etc.,), as well as ensuring the couples file is complete.

<li>The Match with your surrogate

<li>Couple and surrogate receive profiles of each other
<li>Once you have selected one another, a meeting is arranged with your  counselor present
<li>Contracts are drafted, Surrogate has independent legal counsel, and contracts are signed.
