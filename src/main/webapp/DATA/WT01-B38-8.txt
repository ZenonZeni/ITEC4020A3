IS THE PURPOSE OF DRUG LAWS?</b></a><b><br>
by John Lystad</b> </p>

<p align="center">My name is John, and I am currently in a
methadone program since I have long past the stage where I could
tolerate what I would have to do in order to support my habit of
heroin. Here is a short essay on how I view restrictive drug
laws.<br>
<br>
Let us not forget that drug addicts are human beings and as such
are guaranteed certain rights in the Constitution--the Bill of
Rights. Is this not correct? Consider for a second that modern
medical science has recently determined addiction to be genetic
in nature and not a choice. Even without that, don't we have the
right to the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hurt other
people at least in the physical sense? If so, why are we treated
worse than violent offenders when it comes to punishments handed
down by the courts? It seems absurd that a nation could actually
release a murderer from prison so as to make room for a drug
offender. As far as I can see, drug use in and of itself is a
victimless crime if there is no legal or emotional stigma
attached to it. When extreme artificial importance is attached to
something such as the propaganda supporting the &quot;drug
war,&quot; a common result is fascination, neurosis, and
irrational behavior. If an adult wishes to use a mind or body
altering substance, it should be up to that individual.<br>
<br>
No one owns your body except yourself so, therefore, shouldn't
&quot;you&quot; be the deciding factor of what goes into it? If
not, who is to decide and on what basis or whose consideration?
It seems that for all my adult years, somebody or something has
been preventing me from exercising my freedom of choice in a
fundamental way. It has been decided for me one of the most basic
of human rights--what I can or cannot put into my own body. Am I
not smart enough or important enough to decide for myself what
goes into my own body?<br>
<br>
Why was &quot;drug prohibition&quot; started in the first place?
When the Harrison Narcotic Act was passed, there was hardly any
drug problem at all. Out of all the drugs available when they
were legal, there was maybe one addict out of a thousand people,
and anyone could just go to the corner store and buy drugs
cheaply. Now, after over eighty years of this vicious drug war
Puritanism, just look at the marvelous result. Drugs, having
become profitable, are everywhere. Enough is enough; besides, I
hardly think there is anyone on the face of the planet who is
better qualified than me to decide what is right for me.<br>
<br>
Since I was born, I have never seen a day when drugs have not
been hunted down, demonized, condemned, scapegoated, and oh yes,
widely used and hugely profitable. I do not advocate drug use
but, at the same time, I do not condemn it. After all, &quot;drug
prohibition&quot; causes the very thing it is supposed to
suppress--large scale use. This widespread usage comes from the
fact that if you know you have something that people will always
want and have always wanted, then lo and behold it's suddenly
made illegal, you can practically set your price, thus producing
huge profits for any person willing to risk selling it.<br>
<br>
Many people seem to think that addicts are involved in crime so
much because they are high on drugs; nothing could be further
from the truth. In reality, it's more like this: The addict wakes
up in the morning with a terrible knowledge that he/she must come
up with an almost unreal amount of money just to sustain their
habit in order to be able to function for one more day. Since no
honest job can afford them enough money to support their habit at
prohibition prices, the addict must resort to crime if no other
legal way exists for them to continually come up with exorbitant
amounts of money. <br>
<br>
In early addiction, many people, if employed, can afford a light
indulgence on their salary alone. It is common, however, that as
the addiction grows, the job will no longer support the growing
appetite for the drug. This causes absenteeism because a person
going through withdrawal is likely to miss work in order to come
up with some quick money, legal or not, just to feel better. Of
course, this costs the employer money and often leads to
termination of the employee which in itself has a tendency in
many people to increase their desire to use.<br>
<br>
There is another problem with highly restrictive drug laws. They
are terribly expensive to maintain. Who pays? We all do in our
taxes that no longer go toward truly beneficial social programs
that improve our quality of life so as to be able to pay $30,000
per inmate per year to keep drug offenders in overcrowded jails.
Law enforcement and penal institution budgets must also be
continually increased to keep up with the unnecessary but now
abundant drug-related crime.<br>
Our ill-conceived drug policy also takes an emotional toll. Who
nowadays isn't worried about becoming the victim of crime? Could
this lead to an automatic distrust of people unknown to us? What
effect does this have? What parent isn't worried about their
child becoming a casualty of drug-selling violence or peer
pressure? Schools are infested with drug
&quot;entrepreneurs&quot; marketing their product. Why? As long
as drugs are illegal, they will be unnaturally profitable, and
wherever there is a lucrative market for something, people will
take advantage of it and cash in. So, ultimately, anti-drug laws
produce more, not less drug consumption.<br>
<br>
If you're hip to hypocrisy, look at the U.S. as regards Columbia
or Panama. America told Columbia to stop growing coca or suffer
economic consequences while, at the very same time, the U.S. is
their biggest customer for it, making it a most profitable crop.
Second, think of the Noriega incident where America actually
invaded another sovereign nation to kidnap its president,
ostensibly because he didn't do what the U.S. told him to do
regarding the coca trade. I say &quot;ostensibly&quot; because I
believe the real reason America captured Panama's president and
put him in prison is because he had somehow become a threat to
some powerful people's business interests. I wonder how America
would feel if Panama invaded America and took the president
hostage? Not too good I would imagine.<br>
<br>
Cocaine production will never decrease as long as there is a
lucrative market for it, and as long as people keep making a big
fuss about it, there will always be a lucrative market. This is
simply an aspect of the law of supply and demand that holds true
for all goods and services.<br>
<br>
It's time America stopped confusing a medical problem with a
criminal one. The damage already done is immeasurable. The
dangers of holding on to our greed-inspired drug policies include
the very real possibility of losing some of the most precious
things that this country was founded on--Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, free from unreasonable intrusions into some
of the most private aspects of our lives under the guise of law
and order. </p>

- IN MEMORY OF IRA SOBEL</b></a><b> <br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">Ira Sobel died Sunday, July 7, 1996. He had
been hospitalized the week prior for symptoms resulting from
Hepatitis C. According to Joycelyn Woods, Executive
Vice-President of NAMA, he checked himself out of the hospital
against medical advice and started having chest pains a few days
later. He called 911 but by the time they arrived, he was dead. <br>
<br>
Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver, and it is common among
addicts due to the sharing of needles and other infected
paraphernalia. Active addicts and those who have not used in
years are susceptible to this virus. Interferon is used to treat
Hepatitis C, along with strict diet, good personal hygiene, and
abstinence from alcohol. <br>
<br>
Ira experienced a bout of Hepatitis C in March 1995. In his own
words from an article he wrote: <br>
<br>
I experienced severe pain in my legs and ankles. My legs swelled
up and became bloated. I had water retention. I was unaware that
this swelling to my legs is a tell-tale sign of something bad. I
went to a liver specialist who took my blood, and he directed me
to have a sonogram.<br>
<br>
Signs of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) are:<br>
<br>
Elevated liver enzymes<br>
Blood transfusion history<br>
Sex with an IV drug user<br>
Intravenous use history<br>
Swelling of hands or feet (Edema)<br>
Scab-like lesions over arms and legs<br>
<br>
Many of you have commented that you enjoyed reading Ira's
articles. I still have some that he sent me to publish, so you
will see his name in print periodically (In fact, the article by
Ira <b>&quot;LAAM: The Real Deal&quot;</b> was written just
before he died. He was having trouble faxing it to me, and he
decided he was only going to try one last time--fortunately for
us, it worked because he died soon after). Just out of the
hospital, he was worrying about the newsletters for which he
wrote. Ira made a great contribution to Methadone Today, and we
will miss his enthusiasm for methadone advocacy. I know I will
certainly miss his Sunday phone calls to find out how the
newsletter was going. Ira was a great support to me and <b><i>Methadone
Today.<br>

<p align="center"><a name="LAAM:  The Real Deal"><b>LAAM: The
Real Deal</b></a><b><br>
by Ira Sobel (New York City)</b> </p>

<p>I was recently informed by my counselor that my program will
be offering Levomethadyl Acetate Hydrochloride (LAAM) in January
1997. Right up front I will say that LAAM is <b><i>not</i></b> a
long-acting methadone!!! It is a different medication altogether.
LAAM is growing due to its false claims made by the
pharmaceutical company, Roxane. The company puts out a colorful
brochure with claims that by switching to their drug, it
&quot;gives your patients time for a productive life.&quot; What
hooey!!!<br>
<br>
Believe me, it's all about diversion and how the DEA is going to
deal with it. I will try to be objective but again, I say that we
on methadone should know all about every change and proposal
taking place in the methadone treatment field. In this case, LAAM
is just another part of the big picture--just a tip of the
iceberg. There are many new changes and proposals taking place in
the methadone treatment field, such as:<br>
<br>
1. The 7 Day a week, no take-home issue.<br>
<br>
2. The conversion from one type of methadone to another type,
such as the changeover from orange diskette to cherry methadose.
There are at least 4 different types of methadone being dispensed
in methadone programs in New York city.<br>
<br>
3. LAAM, marketed under the name ORLAAM, is being offered at more
programs throughout the United States.<br>
<br>
I have written articles relating to each new development. In the
June 1996 issue of <b><i>Methadone Today</i></b>, I wrote
&quot;The Seven Day Issue: Sneak Attack!!!&quot; concerning the
DEA and their fight for <b><i>all</i></b> patients on methadone
to report to the clinic 7 days a week with no take-homes. The
basis for these proposals are directly linked to loitering and
diversion. To stop diversion, the DEA wants to stop all
take-homes.<br>
<br>
The DEA has not been successful in busting cocaine cartels. The
&quot;War on Drugs&quot; is a failure. So, the powers that be
decided to go after people on methadone throughout the country. A
Real Sneak Attack!!! <br>
<br>
In October 1995, I wrote an article for <b><i>Methadone Awareness</i></b>
called &quot;Winds of Change&quot; in which I depicted the
different types of methadone being used in New York City. In that
piece, I talked about the fears and crucial questions every
person on methadone has about the possible changeover.<br>
<br>
I spoke to many patients who expressed concern when they learned
of changes and about the new types of methadone. For years it was
felt that the orange diskette would be the only form of methadone
dispensed to all people on methadone. Currently, there are at
least four different types being used in New York City. They are:
Orange diskette, Cherry Methadose, White Diskette, and Clear
Liquid, made from powder. When a methadone program changes types
of methadone, there is a transitional period whereby the
patient's body must adjust to the new medication. So, it seems
natural for the patients to have trepidation concerning the
change from one type of methadone to another.<br>
<br>
I see a similarity between the types of methadone development and
now LAAM in that the critical questions and fears remain the
same, such as, &quot;Will I feel different or normal? Will I
experience a feeling of sickness or anxiety? <b><i>Will this new
type of medication hold me?</i></b>&quot; That's the bottom line
here. It all boils down to the fear of the unknown that makes
patients fearful of any change. And that includes me.<br>
<br>
<b>Methadone vs. LAAM <br>
</b>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LAAM, which
is the first alternative medication to treat opiate addiction in
years. It is touted to be a synthetic opiod similar to methadone
but, brothers and sisters, that is not the case. LAAM &quot;is
fundamentally a different medication because it produces a lower
level of narcotic effects than perceived by the methadone
patient.&quot; This quote was made by Walter Ling, at a symposium
in New York City, co-sponsored by The National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) to brief heroin treatment practitioners on the use
of LAAM. Mr. Ling was the principal investigator on two LAAM
studies.<br>
<br>
LAAM was developed in 1948 as a pain killer. When LAAM was tested
in 1952, it was found that the drug could prevent withdrawal
symptoms for 72 hours. That is the major selling point to LAAM.
The simple fact that the drug lasts up to 72 hours, compared to
methadone which lasts from 24-36 hours, is LAAM's ace in the
hole. LAAM has some similarities to methadone, but it is not
methadone. Yes, LAAM is a synthetic narcotic and yes, it lasts up
to 72 hours so patients can reduce the number of times they have
to report to the clinic if they choose LAAM1<br>
<br>
LAAM is fundamentally a different medication than methadone, and
more and more clinic systems are making the switch to include
this medication. Roxane, the pharmaceutical company that produces
ORLAAM, puts out a pamphlet entitled, &quot;Information for
Patients and Family Members&quot; to explain the changeover from
methadone to LAAM. <b>Peace.</b> </p>

<p align="center">1That is, unless they have earned once - or
twice - per - week take home privileges. There are no LAAM take
homes. </p>

<a name="Dangerous Precedent"><b>Dangerous Precedent</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">On March 29, 1996, President Clinton signed
into effect Public Law 104-121. This law eliminates addicts from
eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social
Security Disability (SSD). The new eligibility requirements are
effective &quot;immediately for any new or pending claim for
SSI/SSDI benefits based on the disability determination for
substance abusers where alcoholism and/or drug addiction is a
contributing factor material to the eligibility
determination&quot; (AMTA News Report, May 1996). For those
already receiving benefits, they will be terminated January 1,
1997 unless they reapply by July 29, 1996 and qualify under the
redetermination for something other than alcohol or drug
addiction. <br>
<br>
This is a dangerous precedent. If drug and alcohol problems are
not included in the definition of disability, this could affect
Medicaid and insurance companies' funding of drug and alcohol
treatment. It is very unfortunate that legislators voted this in
and that our President allowed it.<br>
<br>
It is very easy to attack addicts, the poor, women, and children.
It is very easy to take away from the powerless in society, those
who have no voice. This was the easy way out. Addicts have been
so demonized that it is very easy to disallow benefits to them.
It is the old adage--penny wise, pound foolish. Yes, it may look
like a few dollars are being saved, but the fact of the matter is
that for every $1 spent on drug and alcohol treatment, there is a
$7 saving to society. <b><i>For every $1 spent on methadone
treatment, there is a saving of $12 to $14</i></b>. Does it still
look like the same good deal now?<br>

<p align="center"><a name="SAD TALES FROM NASSAU COUNTY JAIL"><b>SAD
TALES FROM NASSAU COUNTY JAIL</b></a><b><br>
</b>Reprinted from Methadone Awareness - October 1995<br>
<b>by Donna Schoen (Long Island, NY)<br>
</b></p>

<p align="center">Several months ago, a friend called me up
unusually upset. The father of her child (who was a patient at
L.I.J. MMTP) called her from Nassau County Jail. Sick with the
AIDS virus, the jail was refusing to medicate him with his
methadone. Phone calls from his program were received by the
jail, pleading with them to medicate this patient. After all, his
body was going through hell from the withdrawal from the
methadone and from being sick with the virus.<br>
<br>
After 7 days of leaving Mr. J.B. sick, crying and begging like a
dog, they finally gave him methadone - a blind 7-day detox.
Whatever the blind dose was, it was inadequate. He still
suffered. After the 7-day inadequate detox, he was given
Clonadine - which is a blood pressure medication which is also
inadequate in detoxing someone off of opiates.<br>
<br>
Being a Patient Advocate, I was outraged at hearing this. I could
feel his suffering. As chairperson of the Patient Committee at
Long Island Jewish, and a member of NAMA, I started hearing more
and more tales of the mistreatment of methadone maintenance
patients at Nassau County Jail. I've heard at least 40 stories
from people that I know were there.<br>
<br>
I was at Rikers Island back in 1992, and I know they have the
&#145;KEEP Program' there. I believe Suffolk County also makes
provisions for methadone patients. All I could think was
&quot;What's wrong with these people? How can they treat human
beings like this?&quot; They are treating us like dogs. They make
us squirm and beg like dogs for our methadone. It is done on a
case by case basis. If they decide to detox you, they will. <b><i>Hard,
fast and dangerously!!!</i></b> And they leave you hanging for <b><i>days</i></b>
while deciding this.<br>
<br>
People have likened the doctor there to someone out of the
Gestapo. The stories were outrageous. All I could think of is
that something has to be done. Any of us living here in Nassau
County could end up there and in the same situation as these
people. I started asking people for their stories about their
stays in the N.C. Jail. Aside from Mr. J.B.'s story (which I just
gave), here are excerpts from some of the stories which I
received:<br>
<br>
<b>Mr. R.C.<br>
</b>&quot;I <b><i>repeatedly</i></b> informed the detectives and
then the guards at NC Jail that I was on a Methadone Program and
on a dosage of 100 mgs. I told them that a detox from such a high
dose could be detrimental. The guards told me &quot;That's your
problem. It's not our fault that you're a drug addict.&quot;
While in lock-up, I started having heart palpitations and was
rushed to Nassau County Medical Center (NCMC), where I was
medicated. But no one would tell me what amount was being
administered.&quot;<br>
<br>
(<b>**What other person, asides from a desperate addict, would
accept being given a medication and not knowing what dose they
were receiving??!)<br>
<br>
Mr. M.G.<br>
</b>&quot;My fifth and most terrifying experience went like this:
I came down to 40 mgs. in anticipation of spending 4 months in
Nassau County Jail Hell. I received a 9-day detox. About 3 days
after the end of my detox, I got really sick and was unable to
stop vomiting. In the course of 1 month, I lost at least 40
pounds. I visited NCMC at least 2 times and was told it was a
stomach virus. I was put on a liquid diet and I stayed in the
shower all day and threw up all night. I told them I was sick and
withdrawing, but none of the doctors at the jail wanted to hear
that. To make a long story short, they gave me exploratory
surgery, and I have the 12-inch scar to prove it. The only thing
they found was a partial obstruction, which the surgeon said was
formed from vomiting for such a long time. I wouldn't wish this
treatment on an enemy! Nassau County needs a change! It's long
overdue!&quot;<br>
<br>
(<b>**Mr. M.G. had similar experiences with other detoxes at
Nassau County Jail, but none as devastating as this one.)<br>
<br>
Mr. B.D.<br>
</b>&quot;I went to Nassau County Jail on A DWI in January 1992.
I told the doctor that I was on methadone and was legally on a
prescription for Xanax (see note below). I never saw an actual
doctor, just a guy with a limp. They said, &quot;Get this guy out
of here.&quot; They sent me to NCMC. They chained me to a bed and
let me withdraw. They gave me Ipecac syrup to induce vomiting.
After 2 days, I was finally given methadone. They never gave me
anything to detox me from the pills. <b><i>I was chained to a bed
for 21 days</i></b>. Then I was returned to the jail. I hadn't
slept in 44 days. <b><i>After I got back to the jail, I had a
seizure.</i></b> Another inmate, (Mr. S.) Had full-blown AIDS. He
was on 100 mgs. of methadone. The doctor told him that the
methadone was killing him. They scared him into stopping the
methadone. He ended up in unbearable pain, had dementia and was
given dialysis. He died.&quot;<br>
<br>
(<b>**Xanax is one of the most dangerous detoxes. Anyone that is
detoxing is vomiting enough on their own without being given
something to induce vomiting. Inducing vomiting on a person that
is detoxing is cruel and dangerous. This could cause the person
to dehydrate, among other things</b>.)<br>
<br>
Something must be done. Although the right thing would be to
maintain meth patients on their present dose (like diabetics
are), the least that could be done is for the jail to institute a
&quot;KEEP&quot; program. None of these people deserve to be
treated like this. This is the 1990's - not the Dark Ages!
Methadone has been used successfully for 30 years. We should not
be thrown in a cell like animals, left without our medication and
sick like dogs. Do these people have any compassion? I guess not.
<b><i>Something has to change.<br>
<br>
Note from the editors of Methadone Today: </i></b><i>Although
these stories happened in Nassau County Jail, any city, Anywhere,
USA could be substituted. It is a sad fact that this is what we
have come to because addicts have been so demonized that people
don't care what happens to them. If an animal was treated the way
these people were treated, there would be animal rights activists
knocking down doors and screaming for resignations. But, these
are &quot;</i><b><i>just&quot;</i></b><i> addicts, and
&quot;they&quot; didn't go to jail to be fed their drugs. That's
the mentality of this country when discussing drugs, I'm sad to
say. Something certainly does have to change, and that
&quot;something&quot; is people's attitudes about a medical
problem that has been made a criminal &quot;justice&quot;
problem.</i> </p>

<p align="center">They hadn't seen such a crowd on Delancey
Street in years. Two weeks ago, ACT UP and Jon Parker's National
AIDS Brigade, incensed by the mayor's decision to close the
city's needle exchange program, came to hand out syringes and
bleach. The Guardian Angels came to stage a counter-protest. When
the cops moved in, the shouting reached a feverish pitch. As the
TV cameras focused on activists being handcuffed, a few addicts
took advantage of the confusion, grabbed some bleach, and fled
down a side street.<br>
<br>
Opponents of safe drug-use programs have long argued that
distributing needles and bleach only encourages addiction. They
maintain that people who use drugs are seeking death and won't
take steps to protect themselves from AIDS. They say that addicts
like to share needles. They are wrong on all three counts.<br>
<br>
I first shot drugs in 1986. A friend gave me my wings. I heard
ringing emptiness in my head and wanted the sensation to last
forever. My friend had injected me with his own works. As I went
on to shoot heroin, I continued to share--but only when there
weren't enough needles to go around. When sociologists first saw
needle sharing, they labeled it a &quot;sub-cultural
ritual.&quot; The myth was that sharing was somehow part of the
high--like passing a joint. But no one asked addicts why they
share. The media was all too willing to point out negative
attributes of drug users, but when it came to needles we were
suddenly supposed to be generous.<br>
<br>
In fact, I never saw needle sharing as a ritual and never heard
of anyone who has. Needles are not meant to be reused. The second
user gets a duller point. When you shoot someone else's blood,
you might get a highly unpleasant reaction--called a
&quot;bonecrusher&quot; on the street.<br>
<br>
The only person I've known who was eager to share was notorious
for it--because no one else liked to do it. He was the poorest of
the crowd of junkies I knew. He injected other people's blood
because he thought there might be dope left in it (He later died
of a cocaine overdose, leaving behind a pregnant, HIV-positive
girlfriend).<br>
<br>
A second myth is that addicts don't care enough about life to
protect themselves from AIDS. While I was doing heroin, I didn't
want to die; I wanted to live without pain. I told myself heroin
was keeping me from suicide. AIDS did not offer such
promise--only slow, painful, almost certain death.<br>
<br>
Two months after I started shooting up, a counselor from San
Francisco showed me how I could protect myself by cleaning my
works. From that time until I got straight, I was never without a
bottle of Clorox. I cleaned my works compulsively, just as I used
them.<br>
<br>
My experience is hardly unique. In San Francisco, before 1986,
only 12 per cent of drug users surveyed said they cleaned their
needles. But three years later, after a massive street education
campaign, the portion had jumped to almost 80 per cent. Infection
rates among IV users in San Francisco haven't risen above 15 per
cent since the campaign got underway. <br>
<br>
Some needle exchange opponents look at these figures and say
bleach alone might do the trick. But with bleach, needle sharing
still occurs, and with it the chance that HIV might be
transmitted. San Francisco's success isn't just due to bleach;
though needles are illegal there too, the city quietly tolerates
an informal exchange program.<br>
<br>
In cities where needle exchange is openly permitted--Seattle,
Portland, Tacoma, Sydney, Hong Kong, Paris, London, Glasgow,
Liverpool, and Amsterdam--HIV infection rates have stabilized at
low levels. In Edinburgh, after a police crackdown on syringes in
1987, infection rates abruptly jumped 10 per cent; six months
after needle exchange was instituted, no further increase was
seen.<br>
Meanwhile, according to a 1988 New York County Lawyers
Association study, in nine states where needles are illegal the
rate of infected IV users is six times higher than in states
where needles can be bought over the counter. The state with the
highest rate of all is New York, where as many as 150,000 addicts
are believed to be infected and each day risk spreading the virus
to other addicts, to their spouses, to their unborn children.<br>
<br>
Opponents of needle exchange are blinded by a third myth: that
distributing needles encourages drug abuse. But there has been no
increase in cities where needles are exchanged. In fact, in some
of these cities, drug abuse has declined.<br>
<br>
Some opponents, particularly in minority communities, believe
that the government purposefully tolerates drug dealing and
mistake the effort to save lives through needle distribution as a
form of genocide. They believe the only way to stop AIDS among
users is drug treatment. But those in the minority community who
work with addicts daily, like Yolanda Serrano of the Association
for Drug Abuse, Prevention, and Treatment, are vocal advocates of
needle exchange. They understand that even in the best rehab
programs only a very small fraction stay clean for life. <br>
<br>
On my last day using drugs, I weighed only 80 pounds. I had
pulled out large clumps of my hair and I was an etiolated
grayish-green. I was 23 and looked twice my age. I looked like an
AIDS patient in the final stages. I found myself begging a friend
for his heroin--pleading, groveling, humiliated. Suddenly I had a
moment of clarity. I saw that I was near death.<br>
<br>
This moment can't be artificially induced. Being around others
who are recovering helps, but the desire to quit must come up
from within. And once it's there, the sight of a needle isn't
going to remove it. That's why the Pavlovian argument against
needle exchange fails. The sight of a needle is no more likely to
make a recovering addict shoot up than the sight of a spoon.<br>
<br>
And needle exchange can be a bridge to treatment. When I went
with Jon Parker's brigade to the streets of Bushwick, where I
used to cop dope, within minutes addicts surrounded him, as if
drawn magnetically. They didn't just take the needles and run.
They listened so they could learn how to stay safe. And they
asked about getting clean.<br>
<br>
When you give addicts needles, you're giving them the right
message--that someone cares enough to want them to stay free of
AIDS even if they continue to use drugs. Dead addicts don't
recover. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Recovery and Harm Reduction"><b>Recovery
and Harm Reduction</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">Since the beginning of the so-called &quot;Drug
War&quot; and &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; our government has been
waging war on the citizens of this country without regard for the
realities of life. It is unrealistic to demand zero tolerance,
especially when we know that addiction is a disease and
genetically passed on from one generation to the next. However,
the Drug Enforcement Agency has become a bloated, powerful
bureaucracy that does not intend to give up its power without a
fierce fight. This also applies to some other agencies who wield
their power and will not let go. This in the face of interfering
with harm reduction policies and treatment of addiction in any
other way than total abstinence. Recovery and success do not have
to mean total abstinence and, in fact, to wait for total
abstinence to deem an addict <b><i>successful </i></b>dooms most
to total failure. Addiction is a medical problem and belongs with
the medical profession--not the criminal justice system. <br>
<br>
I found a newsgroup on the Internet devoted to harm reduction,
and several disturbing items were emailed to me. The first was an
article concerning a needle exchange project in New Jersey. Two
volunteers doing needle exchange work were arrested by the
Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. This is absolutely
intolerable in this day of AIDS. In a perfect world, no one would
be addicted, and no one would be using IV drugs, but this is not
a perfect world. To arrest people devoted to harm reduction is
imposing death sentences on addicts who are PEOPLE who happen to
have a disease. For anyone interested in contacting the DA who
ordered the arrest, his name is Robert Gluck, P.O. Box 71, New
Brunswick, NJ 08903.<br>
<br>
Another item from the San Francisco Chronicle, April 19 (UPI)
concerned &quot;Illegal Mexican black tar heroin contaminated
with an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria [which] killed two
addicts and sickened another 15.&quot; One of the ways health
officials got the word out to addicts was through the needle
exchange program. Of course, this happened in San Francisco and
the needle exchange activists who were arrested were in New
Jersey, but how many addicts contracted AIDS through needle
sharing while these activists were in jail? One is too many!<br>
<br>
Probably none of us knew John Szyler, but we all probably know
someone like him. He was an addict, the founder of the Chicago
Recovery Alliance, and his definition of recovery was &quot;any
positive change.&quot; John died Saturday, May 4th with three
bags of heroin at his side--one was used. It is unknown whether
he overdosed, had &quot;an allergic reaction, poison or
whatever--John had little control over the chemical composition
of the drug [or] its contaminates.&quot; Because addicts cannot
go to their doctors and because doctors usually want nothing to
do with addiction because they will have the Drug Enforcement
Agency breathing down their necks, addicts do not know what they
are getting when they buy a drug. Sad--this person was described
as &quot;a man who loved life and lived it to the fullest. He was
an example to all around him by his kindness and advocacy for
people with HIV and for drug users. He will be severely missed by
all who knew him.&quot; I did not know John, and you probably
don't either, but he most likely did not have to die. Had he been
able to go to a physician for his addiction, he would probably be
alive today to continue to be an example for his kindness. <b><i>Hey,
everybody out there with all this power over life and death, we
are people--we are addicts, yes, but we are people, and we do not
deserve a death sentence.<br>
<br>
</i></b>We, in methadone treatment, are in a different phase of
recovery. Most of us are not using street drugs anymore, but we
are still treated like criminals. We are looked down upon. We are
treated not as people with a medical problem, but we are treated
like a person with a moral deficiency. We do not deserve that
kind of treatment; we need to be treated as any other person who
has a medical problem, and it is about time for a wake-up call
for our politicians. We no longer (if we ever did) have a
&quot;war on drugs.&quot; What we have is a &quot;war on
addicts&quot; in this country. We have totally impossible laws
regarding drug possession--on one hand, we have the Supreme Court
saying that addiction is not a crime, but just possessing the
materials needed to relieve the addiction is a crime. <b><i>What's
goin' on here?</i></b> It is time we found out which politicians
are for us, which are against us and force them to take a stand
one way or the other. Addicts are people, not criminals. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="The Seven Day Issue:  Sneak Attack!!!"><b>The
Seven Day Issue: Sneak Attack!!!</b></a><b><br>
by Ira Sobel (New York City)</b> </p>

<p align="center">The issue at hand is in black and white. The
DEA wants all people on methadone to report to the clinic 7 days
a week. The charge: <b>DIVERSION OF METHADONE</b>. That's every
day, brothers and sisters. It won't matter if you are working and
haven't had a dirty urine in years. The DEA doesn't discriminate.
It will be across the board and that, unfortunately, means all of
us. I have to admit that if these proposals go through, we on
methadone will suffer.<br>
<br>
The basis for these proposals are directly linked to <b><i>loitering
and diversion</i></b>. That's the bottom line. The DEA does not
care to talk about &quot;good&quot; patients or &quot;good
programs!!!&quot; No, all they see is diversion. In their eyes,
every person on methadone diverts their take-home medication.
Anyone who has read one of my articles on the concept of <b><i>methaphobia
</i></b>will understand when I say that the DEA is one of the
biggest <b><i>methaphobic</i></b> organizations in the USA today.
That's fact!!!<br>
<br>
The DEA is getting their noses into the wrong arena. Every person
on methadone is in recovery. Statistics will reveal that the DEA
should stick to busting cocaine cartels and stay out of the
mental health and addictions field. In truth, the DEA has not
been successful in bringing international drug dealing operations
to their knees. The so-called &quot;<b><i>war on drugs&quot;</i></b>
is a failure. <br>
<br>
So the powers that be decided to go after people in methadone
programs throughout the United States. A real sneak attack. It
doesn't matter to them that methadone is a treatment modality.
So, they employed the same surveillance techniques and undercover
operations they regularly utilize in order to catch cocaine
barons. So, to the DEA, each person on methadone is a criminal.<br>
<br>
The DEA is fervent in their aim to have every person on methadone
report to their clinics 7 days a week. There are thousands of
people on methadone who have matured out of committing felony
crimes and drug-related activities. Methadone has been the key
factor in helping thousands upon thousands of recovering people
to change from their previous life of failure and defeat into the
new life of integrity and victory. The DEA sees diversion, and
all I see is that hidden population of methadone patients who
have stopped committing crimes, are gainfully employed, own
businesses, are going to school, getting job training, are
raising children, and haven't had a dirty urine in years. The
last contact with the &quot;<b><i>old life&quot;</i></b> is
coming to the clinic. Sometimes the program is located in the
same neighborhoods where they used to buy and use drugs. So, they
fight for phase changes. These people have simply beat drugs and
have been assimilated into the mainstream, the work force, the
straight world.<br>
<br>
Loitering is one of the most negative behaviors to affect
methadone treatment. The central problem is that <b><i>some </i></b>non-working
patients have too much time on their hands. If these patients had
a structured schedule, whether inside their methadone programs or
referred out to other agencies, programs, services, and schools,
then the authorities and people who live in the community would
begin to see less loitering and patients hanging out near the
clinics.<br>
<br>
People in programs have a lot of talent that just needs
encouragement and support. If there were programs like day care
from 9 to 5, patients could be transformed into productive
members of society. Methadone programs should adopt a plan to
give patients realistic goals to strive for. It would enable us
on methadone to excel at something constructive. This is very
important because anyone on methadone knows first hand the slurs,
chides, and put downs made by family, law enforcement groups, and
people in general who know nothing of the reality of methadone
maintenance. With a new component, patients everywhere would get
a boost in the self-esteem department!<br>
<br>
Since I walk by many programs here in New York City, it's simple
to tell whether the program has a loitering problem or not. In
its place could be a combination of program security, outreach
workers, counselors, and other staff members. I would love to see
a counselor motioning with his arms to the patients outside to
come on in because we have so many new activities! &quot;Welcome,
welcome!&quot; I would love to see that. The sooner the welcome,
the better!<br>
<br>
I believe that together we can change people's attitudes about
methadone treatment by reducing loitering and diversion and
finding new interests for the patients by: 1) Running
programs/classes inside the clinic, 2) Having GED classes so that
patients can get their high school diploma, 3) Indoctrinating
more methadone awareness meetings at every clinic, 4) Setting up
a patient committee to address the loitering issue and other
aspects of the program, and 5) Dosing patients at a dose high
enough to eliminate the need for diversion (as evidenced by
scientific instead of criminal justice guidelines). This would
entail a holistic approach for the good of the program, the
patients themselves, and the community at large.<br>
<br>
I think that a patient committee could be set up with eight
patients, two staff members, and the doctor of the clinic. This
group can help patients with problems, institute more services at
the clinic, and run methadone awareness meetings. I also feel
that having GED classes would help those who had problems in
schools or are self conscious about their shortcomings with
reading and comprehension.<br>
<br>
To require attendance at the clinic 7 days a week will hurt <b><i>all</i></b>
patients in the program, <b><i>but it will be the &quot;good
patients&quot; who have successfully demonstrated their progress
in the program who will suffer the most</i></b>. They are
invariably on a one or two-day-a-week pickup schedule and have
been for years because of their courageous fight to beat drugs
and advance themselves in the workplace.<br>
<br>
Patients who work full time will be forced to report to the
clinic daily, before work. This proposal is really unfair because
the DEA doesn't want to know that many patients are working today
due to being on methadone which has allowed them to stop drug
use. Methadone treatment works. When a patient hasn't had a dirty
urine for a specified amount of time, that patient gets a
supervised urine, and then the phase change goes through. This
translates into coming to the clinic less frequently. These are
the patients (and there are many) who work towards progressing in
the program. And by working, we patients are beating the odds
that are against us. That is why everyone on methadone, who is
employed or who is otherwise using their time constructively, is
a winner.<br>
<br>
Most clinics close before 5:00 p.m., so if we cannot come on a
certain day due to our jobs, we will suffer the consequences--NO
MEDICATION! So, the person is stuck. <b><i>Which is more
important: The job or the methadone? For most, there will be no
job without the methadone.</i></b> This is a crucial point. Many
people have made the wrong choice and are now back on drugs. The
DEA doesn't want to know what a relapse is or if the person has
bounced back and is making strides in methadone treatment.<br>
<br>
There are some providers and owners of methadone programs who are
more interested in policing their programs and making money off
patients than finding new ways to improve treatment and make
services available for you and me (State and Federal agency
regulations have to share in the blame--timewise, she sheer
enormity of the tons of paperwork that has to be dealt with
excludes this. Paperwork is more important than the patient's
life). Loitering will cease when methadone programs start
adopting goals for us to strive for, and this will only be
accomplished when medical treatment is turned back to medicine.
Despite the odds against us, the majority of patients, like
myself, do not loiter and/or divert. We are in recovery, and
there are hundreds of people who go to 12-step and other
self-help groups. <br>
<br>
<b>WE ON METHADONE MUST BE UNITED IN ORDER TO FIGHT AGAINST OUR
COMMON NEMESIS<br>
<br>
</b>In this case, that means the DEA. Diversion is ruining
everything for everybody. We patients who report to the clinic
one or two days a week are the ones who will get burned the most,
and anyone working toward that goal will lose all initiative to
do well. The DEA is pushing for this change in policy which will
affect the entire methadone system in the United States of
America. We must be aware of these proposals, and we as patients
must be united in order to change policy. Methadone advocates are
increasing. The National Alliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA)
is expanding day by day. New chapters are forming. In essence,
these are exciting times for everyone on methadone. We have a
sole purpose: <b>PATIENTS' RIGHTS. </b>That is for you in
Marysville, California; you in Milwaukee; you in Gary, Indiana;
and you in Detroit, Michigan. <br>
<br>
<b>We are all brothers and sisters living on the same spirit! We
will make our stand together. I declare, &quot;All patients on
methadone throughout the USA must unite to fight against the
oppressors, the persecutors, the enemies, the methaphobics, the
DEA.&quot; - Peace.</b> </p>
