	America Needs to Make a Sacrifice
      </H1>
      <P>
      <P>
      <B>America is under attack from all sides and our standard of living is at
      stake. Canada and Europe are dumping imported goods on us, and Mexico, Latin
      America and Asia are invading the U.S. with goods made by child labor. Meanwhile,
      China thumbs its nose at us while subjugating its citizens, employing prison
      labor and selling nuclear arms to Pakistan. Pakistan, at the same time, allows
      the sale of eight year olds to rug manufacturers who produce carpets for
      the American market. And we call this free trade.</B>
      <P>
      <B> Moreover, Canada, our closest ally and friend, has been taking us to
      the cleaners in the trade wars. Canada sells us huge quantities of subsidized
      lumber, but refuses to buy our beer and has been holding the value of the
      Canadian dollar down for years. </B>
      <P>
      <B> While we may have a $200 billion dollar trade deficit for the first time
      in history, most politicians esouse a "don't worry, be happy" attitude. The
      Clinton Administration continues to boast about our exports, yet these same
      policy wonks have ignored the rising tide of imported goods.</B>
      <P>
      <B> Unfortunately, the resulting trade deficit has cost us four million jobs.
      Statistics indicate that six million Americans are now unemployed Americans
      and millions more work for less than they did five years ago. These figures
      do not even mention the fact that many Americans also have to work two jobs
      to make ends meet.</B>
      <P>
      <B> But we can't rely on a government solution to this problem- we have to
      do it ourselves. And we can. While a $200 billion trade deficit sounds
      insurmountable, it helps to look at this problem at the individual level-
      what economists call microeconomics.</B>
      <P>
      <B> If we divide the total U.S. trade deficit by the country's population,
      we find that the average American has a trade deficit of about $740 per year,
      or about two dollars a day. This deficit amounts to the equivalent of buying
      one Japanese automobile every decade, or doing your Christmas shopping for
      a week. Of course, many Christmas decorations are from China, as are many
      toys. But does buying Chinese toys and electronic gadgets that may have been
      made by political prisoners further the Christmas spirit? If you buy a bottle
      of imported beer every day, you may think that it is a small matter, only
      $2 a day. Yet this adds up to over $700 a year, the average American's personal
      trade deficit. Why not try an American microbrew instead? Or if you buy Perrier
      or another imported water every day for a few dollars, why not try America's
      own water, Quibell or Lauret? </B>
      <P>
      <B> Bloomingdale's features elegant holiday gift baskets that include only
      imported products, candy from Holland, apple cider from Canada, cookies from
      Scotland and cheese from France. I received one of these baskets as a gift
      and promptly returned it, trading the gift in for American products. Why
      doesn't Bloomingdales offer a gift basket with a variety of American products?
      It could include olives from California, cheese from Wisconsin, cookies from
      Maine, Salmon from Washington State and citrus from Florida. Instead of bringing
      a bottle of French wine or champagne as a gift for your friends or relatives,
      think about giving them an American present, perhaps something from your
      hometown or one of these regional specialties.</B>
      <P>
      <B> During World War II every American on the home-front had to make sacrifices
      because of the rationing of gasoline, butter, meat and other essentials.
      Now Americans are so pampered that we get upset if our cable service is
      interrupted for a few minutes.</B>
      <P>
      <B>The same could be said for our purchasing practices. Are we so lazy that
      we consider it a sacrifice to look at labels when shopping for products?
      Are we so spoiled that we won't go a little bit out of the way to find American
      products?</B>
      <P>
      <B> Automobile imports remain a large chunk of our trade deficit. We have
      started to sell a small stream of American cars to Japan, but we are still
      flooded with boatloads of Japanese imports. According to J.D. Power and
      Associates, the quality of American cars and Japanese cars is virtually equal,
      with European cars lagging far behind. However, the myth of Japanese and
      European superiority still survives. </B>
      <P>
      <B> If your heart is still set on a Japanese automobile or a European one,
      how much of a sacrifice is it to buy a comparable car made in the USA? Acura
      already manufactures several of its models in America. BMW makes its Z3 model
      in its new state-of-the-art plant in South Carolina. Honda has been making
      Accords and Civics in Ohio for more than ten years. Toyota manufactures its
      Corolla, Camry and Avalon models in California and Kentucky. Nissan makes
      the Quest minivan here, as well as the Altima and some Sentras. With this
      wide variety of "imported" models made in the USA, there is no reason to
      buy an imported car.</B>
      <P>
      <B> For help in buying American products you will need a copy of a book,
      Made in the USA: The Complete Guide to Buying America's Best Products and
      a telephone. The guide shows you how to find top-quality American-made products
      via catalog and by telephone. Unfortunately, many retailers only carry cheap
      foreign goods marked up 400% instead of American-made products that they
      can only be doubled in price. It's really not much of a sacrifice to order
      products over the phone or through the mail because you'll be saving gasoline
      and time. Plus, most of that gasoline is imported anyway, so you will be
      protecting the American economy in two ways.</B>
      <P>
      <B> The truth is, you're not really the one undergoing hardships by searching
      out American products. It's the eight-year olds who stitch Nike soccer balls
      in Pakistan who have made the sacrifices, not the Americans. But the American
      dream can be restored by a new movement, lead by our youngest citizens, to
      look for U.S.-made products. I call upon younger generations to give up your
      Nintendos, Volkswagens, Nikes and Evian spring water. You complain about
      the state in which this country has been left, but now you can do something
      to improve it while contributing to an American revival. The future of America
      is in your hands. Think about this every time you open your wallet- and vote
      with your dollars for American-made products. It's a small sacrifice to
      make.</B>
