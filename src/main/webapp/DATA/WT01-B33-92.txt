<p><font size="2">'It's opium, Dearie. Neither more nor less. And
it's like a human creetur so far, that you always hear what can
be said against it, but seldom what can be said in its praise.' -
Charles Dickens, <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Introduction </h1>

<p><font size="2">I claim that, if one does NOT insist that (i)
drugs are essentially neutral - having good or bad effects
depending upon circumstances only - and that (ii) one has a moral
and legal right to take the drugs of his (or her) choice without
government regulation, control, or interference, that: (1) the
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) position can be defended
effectively by a non-governmental person (unconstrained by
separation of Church and State) and (2) the pro-legalization
position can be defeated in debate as Charles Rangel defeated
William Buckley in the &quot;Firing Line&quot; debate on the
Public Broadcasting System. (The letter I sent Buckley subsequent
to that debate is in Appendix A.) The argument recommended by
Cliff Schaffer in his paper, &quot;Persuasive Strategies&quot;
and Schaffer's point-by point rebuttal to the DEA position is
convenient to employ as the (imaginary) argument to be defeated
by the (imaginary) civilian apologist for the War on Drugs. By
&quot;civilian&quot;, I mean someone unconstrained by separation
of Church and State and for whom a prohibitionist position does
not represent a conflict of interest, e.g., someone who is not
employed by the DEA. On the other hand, if one insists upon the
aforementioned (provable) conditions, the DEA can be defeated, as
will be shown in the second part of this paper.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Armed with the philosophically and
pharmacologically correct positions on the two crucial issues, I
can defeat an imaginary &quot;civilian&quot; apologist for the
DEA, i.e., a supporter of the War of Drugs. First (1), I show why
the laws against drugs are immoral and illegal
(unconstitutional). Next (2), I attack the morals, motives, and
methods of the drug warriors, thus my argumentation must be
squeaky clean even if I have to admit weak links in my chain of
reasoning (I am generous and give my opponent all the ammunition
he is ever likely to find to use against me; of course, my armor
plating has been designed to withstand this very ammunition).
Then (3), I give arguments for legalization avoiding nearly all
of the arguments discussed in the unnumbered book <i>Drug
Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions</i>; these are the
arguments for which my opponent is not likely to be prepared. If
he can't prepare an argument on the spot, he will be in serious
intellectual trouble. (Cliff Schaffer points out that the reason
this book has no document number or control number or any
reference number whatsoever is that the government didn't want to
publish or admit to publishing this book. I believe he is right.)
Finally (4), I demolish most of the arguments the DEA gives in
the book avoiding the two or three points that I am willing to
concede as I don't believe any of us knows very much about them,
viz., alcohol prohibition in the U.S., the experiences of foreign
governments, and environmental uses. However, I do point out the
unfair tactics used by the DEA. The DEA employs fallacies even in
the very few cases where an honest argument would have sufficed.
I shall omit Step 3 in this presentation as it is covered
adequately in my earlier essays, which shall be made available to
interested parties (Actually, this, my latest essay on drug
policy, may be part of a complete collection if it can be
arranged.)</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Partial Rebuttal of Cliff Schaffer's Argument
by an Imaginary &quot;Civilian&quot; Apologist for the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA) </h1>

<p><font size="2">Assume that drugs are unmitigated evil and that
no one has a moral or legal right to use them. As an example of a
defense of the DEA position let us attempt to rebut Cliff
Schaffer's argument - not line by line at this time, although I
have annotated his argument against the DEA essentially line by
line, but this results in too much repetition. Rather, I will
give a few samples of rebuttals that will suffice for one or more
of his arguments. This half of my thesis is less important and
will receive considerably less space, since, like Cliff, I am
interested to defeat the DEA. We differ only in which approach to
the common goal we prefer.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1) A DEA apologist might say, &quot;You
misunderstand the aims of our strategy, which have been fulfilled
to a remarkable degree for the present generation. We must push
forward to benefit future generations similarly. To ask for a
drug-free America is asking too much. However, we have made it
much harder for the productive members of society to get drugs
and, in contrast with the sixties and early seventies, almost no
one approves of drugs. Even artists no longer use drugs to any
great extent, which you can tell by the lack of deep feeling in
their work. In the inner city, the drugs are so weak that it is
difficult for people to become addicted - even to heroin.
Conceivably, most heroin habits are largely imaginary. Jail is an
essential part of our strategy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Mr. Schaffer is either being dishonest or
facetious when he asks us if jail makes people more productive.
We never said (and Mr. Schaffer knows that we don't mean to
imply) that people who go to jail are more productive than they
would be otherwise (they probably were not very productive to
begin with), however many people abstain from drugs or
drastically curtail their drug use to avoid or reduce the risk of
jail and they are the ones we expect to be more productive.
Certainly, Mr. Schaffer knows this. The deterrent effect of jail
is greater in the white population because whites do less well in
jail and jail is more of a disgrace for them, whereas many black
men take jail in stride. Some even feel more at home in jail that
on the street. It's good that they are in jail as they are
provided for and they do not set a bad example in the population
at large.&quot; (From now on I drop the quotes. Also, I shall
abandon the effort of the speaker to emphasize that he is not
part of the DEA, but the reader is to understand he is not
anyway. Therefore, his community standards argument can be rather
religious in nature, which will be harmful to Mr. Schaffer's
likeability - as he, Mr. Schaffer, appears to be going against
God! It is doubtful that Mr. Schaffer holds a degree as high as
the PhD as he puts his SAT scores in English up as evidence of
his entitlement to criticize his interlocutor for using
&quot;big&quot; words. Twice he refers to big words as
sequipedalianistic, which, of course, is an old joke, apparently
not understood by Mr. Schaffer as jokes are not usually told
twice. This is <i>ad hominem</i> and not part of the argument.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">2) Mr. Schaffer continues to preface his
remarks with &quot;Every major study shows ...&quot; How did he
become qualified to determine which are major studies and which
are not? How does he know that he is familiar with every study?
This is indeed remarkable. I have here the tables of contents of
the latest issues of the five leading refereed journals dealing
with this subject. Would he be willing to state the results of
each study as I state the journal and authors' names? The
throwing around of names of authoritative studies is an example
of what Jeremy Bentham calls the <i>ad verecundiam</i> fallacy,
i.e., an appeal to the natural modesty of the interlocutor. This
is a form of sophistry designed to make us seem inferior when
there is no good reason why we should. Undoubtedly, Mr. Schaffer
is not familiar with the results of most of the best science done
in this area although he would like us to imagine that he is.
Also, Mr. Schaffer is cavalier with expressions such as &quot;No
one believes ....&quot;, &quot;Everyone knows ... &quot;. These
are sweeping statements and rather dubious to say the least.
Could it be that Mr. Schaffer plays fast and loose with the
facts? Since his remarks obviously are memorized, conceivably he
has read none of the studies, and receives his information
second-hand. A few simple test questions should determine if this
is the case. I have in this box photocopies of hundreds of
reviewed articles supporting our claims. Shall we see how
familiar Mr. Schaffer is with these studies and which he
considers major? Shall we plumb the depth of his knowledge of the
study he last mentioned?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3) Mr. Schaffer refers frequently to historical
facts that tend to support his thesis that drug laws were passed
for all the wrong reasons. Besides being irrelevant to the
question of whether or not they are good laws, what gets written
in history books tends to depend upon the biases of the
historian. Much of this history was written during the long
period, which has not yet ended, in which history departments at
most universities have been dominated by left-wing liberals who
tend to denigrate the white male patriarchy regardless of what
actually occurred. This is part of being &quot;politically
correct&quot; and is only just now being recognized as just as
unfair and biased as history in praise of chattel slavery. The
white male is inevitably cast in the role of demon and the
minority or economically disadvantaged groups are portrayed
always as victims regardless of how many white males they
scalped.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4) Mr. Schaffer claims he wants sensible drug
laws, but he doesn't say what is sensible nor does he give an
example of a sensible drug law.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5) On the contrary, if drug use is immoral it
is certainly not sensible to tolerate it under the law. If we
did, the law would be incomplete and therefore flawed (containing
something immoral but not illegal). (This is as bad as something
moral but illegal and imputes evil unto the law - if I may
paraphrase Bertrand Russell.) To be fair we should say &quot;more
flawed than it already is&quot;. We are trying to reach an ideal
set of laws, which can be done only after an infinite period of
struggle. We must never bring discredit to the law knowingly,
though. The law does not enjoy much respect - even in the
middle-class. This does not promote the welfare of the State.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">6) Arguments about the success or failure of
drug legalization or prohibition in foreign countries can be
skewed because drugs may not be despised as much abroad as here.
We have done a better job of drug education, presumably. I don't
think we should have too much confidence in anyone's ability to
evaluate the success or failure of drug policies abroad,
therefore I wouldn't make too much of Mr. Schaffer's defense of
so-called legalization programs abroad. Clearly, though,
variations in punishment of drug use from place to place be it
continent to continent or county to county are bound to engender
some migrancy. As we do not approve of unnecessary and wasteful
migrancy because of its environmental and social effects, we
should continue to insist upon a universal international attack
on drugs all over the world to avoid providing safe havens for
moral degenerates.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">7) If adults can get drugs more easily,
children will be able to get drugs more easily. Many adults are
willing to provide drugs for kids as they provided alcohol for me
when I was a kid - either for monetary compensation or for other
reasons of their own (perhaps misguided goodness of heart). I
nearly died driving a car after adults gave me so much liquor
that I had to be carried to my car and placed behind the wheel
where my automatic pilot took over until I plowed into three
parked cars totaling all three and the brand new car I was
driving and putting myself in the hospital. Some goodness of
heart. This could occur if drugs were legal and supplanted
alcohol as the party enhancer of choice.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">8) If multi-national corporations were free to
market drugs, they could employ the media blitzes that have made
Advil a household word in a very short time. If they were no more
scrupulous in the sale of heroin or cocaine than they have been
with Tylenol or Micatin - making extravagant and patently false
and/or deceptive claims, society might be even more threatened
than it is now with dangerous patent medicines. A Tylenol OD is
not a pretty picture. Virtually every vital organ shuts down.
These companies have no morals. It is not their business to have
morals. Profits feed the bulldog and we all know it. &quot;A man
with a wife and children to support will do anything for
money.&quot; His justification is represented by the charming
family portrait on his desk next to his calendar.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9) If heroin were legal, it stands to reason
that it would be more popular than alcohol. It's a much better
drug and gives more pleasure to the user. Many people do not
realize they are hooked until they try to stop. They don't want
to stop because it's so enjoyable and, for awhile, they may be
able to carry on their lives more effectively than they could
without it. Thus, they have a large window of opportunity to
become addicted. Young people think they are invulnerable.
&quot;Other people might get hooked but not me.&quot; The upshot
is that, with such a seemingly superior product and a long period
of time before its drawbacks are perceived, we have circumstances
guaranteed to result in many more users than currently and quite
plausibly more users than alcohol has ever been able to attract.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">10) The following is a very important point and
the simulator would like the reader to imagine that this speech
is to be delivered with many embellishments and passionate
religious fervor. We cannot have laws in conflict with our
community moral standards and our family values. We cannot allow
these degenerates and perverts to walk freely among us - possibly
infecting our children with their vile condition. This is a
God-fearing Christian country and we will not let the devil have
our children. Blah, blah, blah.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11) Jail is more effective than treatment.
People must be held accountable for the laws they break.
Prevention works especially when backed up by the deterrent of
jail - both the physical inconvenience of jail especially to
whites and the shame of going to jail particularly for whites.
The black religious leaders must make blacks more ashamed of jail
than they are currently. They may employ the argument that their
own shame is shared by all blacks and that they have let down
their brothers and sisters if they go to jail. One Black in jail
is a disgrace to all Blacks. Consider the argument used by
Dickens with respect to the Jew in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>. He
is a good man, so he leaves the money lending business, which he
was fronting for a gentile anyway, so as not to disgrace all
Jews. &quot;When a Greek goes bad, they say, 'Well, there's some
bad apples in every race', but when a Jew does something of which
society does not approve, they say, 'All Jews are bad.' &quot;
So, Riah leaves the money-lending business and goes to work in a
factory operated by Jews that is a model enterprise for its day
with the best treatment of employees imaginable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This ends Part I, wherein I have played the
Devil's advocate against an opponent not armed with moral outrage
and faith in all the good uses of drugs.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Rebuttal to the Arguments in the Book: <i>Drug
Legalization: Myths and Misconceptions</i>, by Raymond J.
McKinnon, Published by the Drug Enforcement Agency to Teach
Prohibitionists How to Argue with Pro-Legalization Advocates </h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p><font size="2">I now wish to refute the arguments of the DEA
armed with moral outrage and faith in all the good uses of drugs,
which, according to the beliefs of this author, a benevolent and
far-seeing God included in His design of Nature so that men might
be spiritually inspired by song, story, verse, and imagery to
draw closer to Him. (The author's religious viewpoint toward
drugs explains, metaphorically, why he claims that virtually ALL
great artists used and use drugs as do the greatest scientists
who share the worship of the infinite with artists as discussed
by Whitehead, which makes them the only true scientists, the
others being more or less technicians, though not to be entirely
disparaged if that is all they are capable of. If they took drugs
they might be capable of much more; but, in many cases, their
love of this earthly life, however fleeting and petty, far
exceeds their love of the infinite in the sense of Whitehead -
and Russell, too (writing independently). Therefore, they avoid
drugs because they believe, perhaps correctly, that drugs might
shorten their lives. The author has no intention to prove his
belief, which is, after all, a religious belief. He asks merely
for the same respect that other religious people ask for their
views. Obviously, this view is protected by the Free Exercise
clause of the First Amendment, regardless of what anyone else,
e.g., a Supreme Court justice, thinks.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thus, I have not proved this close connection
between art and science and drugs. Nevertheless, I am permitted
to assume that such a connection exists in this exposition as an
example of a good use of drugs, which is assumed to exist; and
this positive use is as good as any and reasonably easy to
believe. I do not believe it is fair to &quot;out&quot; living
artists and scientists, but many artists and scientists who are
deceased and have left adequate documentation of their drug use
should convince a fair-minded person that this connection exists.
</font><a name="rmzgreats"><font color="#0000FF"><font size="2">See
Appendix B.</font></font></a> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Declaration of Independence written ca.
1776 gives man the unalienable rights of life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. Surely by 1789 the Founding Fathers had not
forgotten this when they wrote the Ninth Amendment: &quot;The
enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
people&quot;. [quoted loosely from memory] Among those other
rights must be liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They did not
guarantee happiness - only its pursuit. Certainly, many men
pursue happiness in no other way than by taking drugs. Your
opinion of whether they are likely to find happiness in this way
does not abrogate their right to pursue happiness in this way.
Needless to say, a man is not free, i.e., possesses not liberty,
unless he can take whatever drugs he wishes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amazingly, the argument that drugs actually
enslave the user has been advanced lately; so, apparently, it is
not &quot;needless to say&quot;. This is very easily refuted. A
passage borrowed from another essay should suffice:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">[R. Emmitt] Tyrrell employs the term
&quot;enthralls&quot; with two distinct meanings. This is
equivocation, which is unfair in debate. Since we are enthralled
by drugs as we would be by a great love, it is easy to agree that
these wonderful, miraculous, divine drugs of antiquity have lost
none of their charm with age. It is as though our beloved were
snatched from our arms when the word is suddenly used to connote
slavery, which we detest. We are no more enslaved by our favorite
drugs than we are by our favorite foods - or, to bring home the
sharp sword of truth, far less than the average employed American
is enslaved by his job. The average drug user is free compared to
the average corporate employee. This is the beauty of Jack
Nicholson's speech in the pot smoking scene in the film <i>Easy
Rider</i> when he tells the bikers that the townspeople fear them
because they represent freedom. The druggies of the Beat
Generation and subsequently have been symbolic of man's quest for
freedom. From among us come the free spirits of the land. Only
the oppressor's iron yoke can bow the heads of those who dare to
tread the paths of the liberated criminal saints of the
free-wheeling drug culture. The whole world knows this is true.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">This enslavement argument is extraordinarily
perverse as the whole point of the War of Drugs is to enslave the
world in the interests of the multi-national corporations, i.e.,
the rulers of the world, and those who serve them. Drug users are
not good candidates for wage slaves and they are most likely to
break the mental shackles forged by the massive indoctrination to
which ordinary people are subjected beginning even before
pre-school as their parents are very likely mental zombies and
which continues throughout school and on the nightly news and in
every statement made by the government or big-business through
its massive advertising campaigns, which, lately, have taken to
disseminating such philosophical gems as &quot;Life is a sport;
drink it up.&quot; Drugs serve as a conscious shock, in the sense
of Uspenskii [1], which reorders rigid mental patterns by which
the received wisdom of the church, the workplace, and the State
keep us in line - docile servants of the agendas of the rich
whose &quot;vile maxim&quot; is &quot;everything for us and
nothing for anyone else&quot;. Business (capitalism) requires
large supplies of readily available, unthinking, docile workers,
who may be employed when needed and laid off when not. They refer
to these unfortunate human beings as human resources, which is
supposed to be a more advanced term than <i>employee</i> but
which tends to corroborate our claim that business thinks of
people as so many tons of coal just like any other business
resource.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Allow me to reprint my earlier remarks [2] on
this subject:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Users of drugs are referred to as
&quot;slaves&quot; even though they act more independently than
the average employee of the average American corporation.
Actually, the average religionist, who accepts religious dogma
without reservation is more of a slave than is the most hooked
addict; i.e., the religionist's soul is entirely subjugated
whereas the body only of the addict is under the control of the
addicting drug, as evidenced by the fact that his will remains
free to wish to be free of the addiction. Even this analysis is
granting too much to the use of the word slave. How can one
become the slave of an inanimate substance, which has no will!</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">After we have cleared away the garbage-speak
and the double-speak, we see that freedom to take drugs is a
major point. Many people rate taking drugs higher than sex. Would
you like to prohibit sex? Just try it. To many people, (taking)
drugs is not just the best thing - it's the only thing. Drug
tyranny is total tyranny. Then there is art, which, without
drugs, is gone. Naturally, the establishment wants to keep us
from taking drugs. Taking one tip from Uspenskii, another clue
from Aldous Huxley, and from personal observation, I have
determined that drugs is the fastest route to political. social,
and economic enlightenment - perhaps the only route. (A friend of
mine confessed that he had been a hidebound, right-wing Christian
reactionary until he smoked one joint. The scales fell from his
eyes - instantly.) Cast off the shackles of your mind. &quot;Turn
on; tune in; and drop out.&quot; As Jack Nicholson's character,
George, an open-minded lawyer and an alcoholic, in <i>Easy Rider</i>
says, &quot;They're afraid of you because you represent freedom
and freedom terrifies them.&quot; [quoted loosely]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Tenth Amendment may be violated as well,
since, as we have shown, such laws may not be enacted by the
federal government. The only question is whether the Constitution
prohibits the States from enacting such laws. In any case, the
Texas Constitution, for example, prohibits the passage of such
laws because of their religious nature. (The Texas Constitution
separates Church and State more definitely than does the U.S.
Constitution.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have alluded to the religious aspect of drugs
above. Drugs also entail normally a great deal of group ritual
that has every feature of a formal religious observation or rite,
thus the Free-Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is violated
by any law that prohibits these rituals. Actually, the decision
to take drugs or not is a moral decision; moral decisions are
religious decisions; thus &quot;Congress shall make no law
respecting&quot; [with respect to] them, which is the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Moreover, the
controlled substances act has no proper definition of
&quot;substance&quot;, which, according to Bertrand Russell [3],
is a nonsense term, nor is the odd term &quot;drug abuse&quot;
defined. (Does it mean that the user is harming the drug as in
child abuse or does it mean the drug is abusing the user? To
satisfy the due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment, laws have
to make sense. The controlled substance law, employing undefined
terms, does not make sense, thus the drug laws violate due
process as well. Throw in a little illegal search and seizure and
violation of privacy (Fourth Amendment) and you have a nice mess
of constitution bashing all in the name of protecting us from
ourselves. Not a pretty picture. What do you do when you live in
a tyranny with unfair, illegal, and plain wicked laws? You break
them and with a vengeance. If hard drug users would act up like
Act Up, the government would be reeling. I wish drug users would
act up a little more. I believe some &quot;dirty tricks&quot; <i>a
la</i> Abbie Hoffman are in order. A little polite ass kicking
might get some people's attention as well. You know, the place to
get their attention is where they live. (I prefer massive
graffiti attacks, e.g., spray painting &quot;liars&quot;,
&quot;thieves&quot; in huge black letters across the front of the
DEA building in Washington or on the homes of prominent drug
warriors.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have written voluminously on the positive
uses of drugs and the rights of drug users. This is as much as I
need to repeat here, because I am going to assume the two
condition in my argument anyway. They don't have to be true for
this argument to be true. I wish only to illustrate the utility
of proving that they are true. I wish to show how much you can
prove once you have these two simple principles at your disposal;
namely, (i) the laws against drugs are illegal and immoral and
(ii) drugs are inherently neutral such that the desirability of
drug use depends upon circumstances.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">After I attack their arguments, I plan to
introduce arguments from my earlier papers that they are
undoubtedly not prepared to rebut. If I am to go first, I would
studiously avoid every argument in their book! This should create
general confusion among poor debaters who cannot think for
themselves on their feet. I intend to approach their arguments in
two ways: (i) logically, i.e., without an appeal to questionable
data, and (ii) empirically, concentrating mainly on their
misstatements.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally and most importantly, one can state
with confidence that no valid scientific evidence exists to
indicate that the use of drugs is more harmful than it is
beneficial or that it causes any type of impairment rather than
enhanced abilities as we claim. Actually, no satisfactory
experiment can be performed to test the effects of drugs on
humans so long as we are living in a state of mass hysteria that
is guaranteed to skew the results. Nor will any such experiment
be performed before drugs are legal and drug use is normalized to
the point where a drug user is considered no more abnormal than a
reader of poetry, say.</font> </p>

<h2>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES </h2>

<p><font size="2"><b>Fletcher's Doctrine:</b> This comes from
legal philosophy. It proposes that the drunken man is not
responsible for what he does when he is drunk, but the sober man
he was when he decided to become drunk and, then, performed the
acts required to become drunk is responsible for what the drunken
man has done. This is fair because the person enabling the
drunkard presumably had good knowledge from personal experience
of how the drunken man might behave. No one gets away with
anything.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Dram shop laws:</b> The Fletcher Doctrine,
which is valid, is in sharp contrast with the dram shop laws,
which punish individuals who may have no knowledge of the
individual whom they enable to become intoxicated, who are in the
business legally of so enabling him, and who have every right to
assume his behavior will be rational and normal. Dram shop laws
are unfair and violate due process, probably, as they are
unreasonable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Definition (Imaginary offense).</b> An
imaginary offense is an act that appears to violate the rights of
another individual only because of how that individual conceives
of that act. But, with a different viewpoint on the part of the
person putatively offended would not violate any rights
whatsoever, in contradistinction with acts that violate the
rights of individuals regardless of what they think. An example
is a mother who imagines that her son's homosexuality is ruining
her life, but would not be offended or inconvenienced if her
attitude toward homosexuality were different. Many family members
of drug users imagine that they are disgraced by the behavior of
their close relative who uses drugs, but this is because they
have a bigoted and intolerant attitude toward drug use, in many
cases inculcated by anti-drug propaganda and mass hysteria. The
proof of this is that in some families no one thinks anything of
it. If the rights of one family are not violated by the drug use
of one of its members, then no family's rights are violated
because the verdict depends upon how the non-users think and is
completely independent of the behavior of the drug user. If, on
the other hand, the drug user beats his wife when he is on drugs,
the Fletcher Doctrine kicks in.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Wayburn's Doctrine (unless a prior
enunciator of the doctrine can be identified): </b>One cannot be
convicted of a crime in the average. Crimes do not apply to
statistical averages, but to individuals only. A statistical
average cannot commit a crime. If an activity is harmless in some
cases then it cannot be considered a crime. One must discover
what aspect of that activity is always harmful to identify the
crime. Thus, since using drugs is normally (or even sometimes)
harmless, in which case it interferes with no one's rights and
the State has no compelling reason to prevent it, it cannot be
considered a crime even if it is harmful in some particular case
involving some particular individual or individuals. One must
base criminal law upon the combination of the activity and the
harmfulness. If, due to societal conditions, harm is done
independent of the user of the drugs and because of circumstances
that are not of his making, the harm should be blamed on the
social conditions operative and, since all of society is to
blame, no criminal law can be construed. This is very much
related to the commonly known principle that a person may not be
punished for a crime until he commits it - certainly not because
people who share some characteristic with him have committed the
crime in the past.</font> </p>

<h2>SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE DEA ARGUMENT </h2>

<h3 align="center">Dyslogistic and Eulogistic Fallacies
(Respectively) </h3>

<p><font size="2">These consist in using terms that have negative
or positive (respectively) connotations in situations that call
for neutral expressions, generally because they belong to
statements about which nothing has been proven, often statements
that would be the conclusions of their logical developments, if
they had resulted from logical developments rather than a jump
directly to the conclusion without evidence or logical
development of any type, usually appealing to nothing better than
popular opinion or the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;, which in
some cases has been &quot;manufactured&quot; by their own
propaganda. A good example is the use of the conclusory terms
&quot;myths&quot; and &quot;misconceptions&quot; in the title of
their book, which, by the way, is in violation of their mandate
and represents a clear-cut conflict of interest.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Passing off unscientific work as scientific </h3>

<p><font size="2">The literature cited by the DEA refers, in some
cases, to &quot;scientific&quot; studies funded by organizations
with a vested interest in the outcome. Impartiality is an
absolute requirement for science. That work is disqualified. In
other cases, unrefereed journals such as the <i>New York Times</i>
are cited. This, too, cuts no ice. Only very few studies have
even a chance of having been performed by scientists who are
disinterested in the outcome. Even university professors know
what side they are on before the study commences.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Shifting the Purpose of the Drug War to
Accommodate the Argument </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is not very specific as to the purpose
of the War on Drugs. Obviously, the intent is to prevent people
from taking drugs. But, why? Actually, a host of social ills are
ascribed to the manufacture, sale, and consumption of drugs.
However, over the course of their (imaginary) rebuttal to the
affirmative of the question: Should Drugs Be Legalized? one ill
or the other is mentioned depending on the argument they pretend
to be refuting.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Occasionally, the great &quot;evils&quot; that
are supposed to arise due to legalization are inherently neutral
and may actually be beneficial under important circumstances. For
example, addiction is beneficial if it is in the best interests
of the &quot;victim&quot; of &quot;addiction&quot; not to forget
to take the drug in question regularly. If blood pressure pills
were addictive, we wouldn't forget to take them, would we!</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Sometimes the &quot;bad effect&quot; to be
avoided actually favors one or more of the other goals of the
War. For example, early death by overdose of heroin certainly
reduces the share of the national health-care budget consumed by
the victim. Also, if the user can write his own prescriptions -
for athlete's foot medication, as well as for sleeping
medication, if indicated - the doctor's time is saved and the
health-care budget is reduced. Physicians, in particular, do not
want the health-care budget to be reduced. They wish to gather
more and more conflicts in living under their already sweeping
purview. For example, physicians want to take charge of the
gang-warfare problem!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is careful not to mention mitigating
circumstances that do not favor their argument. Clearly, they are
interested in winning this debate by whatever means necessary
rather than arriving at a valid policy, which, unfortunately,
would cost them their jobs. They have a definite bias, but so do
I. I want a longer drug menu. Moreover, I wish to avoid going to
jail. Actually, jail for me, even for five minutes, is absolutely
out of the question!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It makes sense to look at the DEA rebuttal from
the point of view of its goals, real or pretended, to determine
if a goal is worth achieving or if a circumstance that interferes
with one goal achieves another. I shall employ an outline form in
which the Roman numerals correspond roughly to chapter numbers.
This section may serve as a brief summary of the remarks that
will follow, although I will have much to say that will not be
repeated.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">I. ADDICTION</font> </h4>

<h5>A. Biological </h5>

<p>The only difficulty with addiction occurs if it becomes
necessary to stop the addictive behavior. But, why would anyone
want to stop taking drugs unless an external influence were
operative. (Occasionally, though, people just stop for no
apparent reason, in which case the addiction has disappeared and,
therefore, was not a serious problem - at least not the problem
it was cracked up to be.) Normally, the external influence arises
because of the laws against drugs and the propaganda necessary to
&quot;sell&quot; an inhuman and unnatural point of view to
otherwise rational persons. Taking drugs is a natural trait of a
natural person and has been since drugs were discovered in
pre-history. No one has any evidence to the contrary, thus the
position need not be defended. If one disagrees, one merely holds
a different view and nothing more. This is insufficient reason to
exercise tyranny. </p>

<h5>B. Psychological </h5>

<p>The psychological aspect of &quot;addiction&quot; is, in the
view of Dr. Robert Goodman [4], a manifestation of the simple
fact that we like to repeat pleasant experiences. It is simply
absurd to try to turn that into a pathology. In Iran, when
opiates were legal, a large proportion of the population consumed
them. Is it reasonable to suppose that a large proportion of the
population of Iran was mentally ill! </p>

<h4>II. CRIME </h4>

<p>As will be shown, it is futile to claim that crime will be a
serious consequence of drug legalization. Crime is caused by our
insistence upon allowing human activity to center around
competition for wealth and power - our refusal, in the face of
incontrovertible evidence, to abandon competition for wealth,
power, and fame utterly! [5] </p>

<h4>III. PLACES WHERE LEGALIZATION FAILED </h4>

<h5>A. Addiction increased. </h5>

<p>For every bad case of addiction they can find, I can find a
good case. Addiction like drugs themselves, is neutral, i.e.,
depending upon circumstances as to its desirability. One may not
demonize addiction any more than one may demonize drugs. The
demons are imaginary. This view is just as good as any and must
be respected until a valid scientific experiment proves
otherwise. No such experiment has been made. Always drugs are
placed in a singularly disadvantageous position, thus ensuring
the results desired by the biased pseudo-scientists. (A true
scientist must be absolutely fair if not completely
disinterested. It is practically impossible to find a
disinterested scientist and, if he could be found, who would fund
his research?) </p>

<h5>B. Death rate of users increased. </h5>

<p>The true spiritual man is undaunted by this kind of talk. It
means nothing to him. But, his death, in any case, if, indeed,
there is any rational reason to fear death from drugs in a
normalized society where drugs are legal and drug users are
treated like everyone else or like an avid reader of good
literature, for example, i.e., merely an anomaly, I say, his
death will normally be quick and inexpensive so that people who
think along such lines (sorry specimens of humanity in my view)
needn't worry about having to support health care for someone
they don't like or have no interest in. (In Appendix C, I show
that the laws against drugs cause many more deaths than are
caused by drugs themselves. This provides a compelling reason for
legalization.) </p>

<h5>C. Crime increased. </h5>

<p>The evidence presented by the DEA seems to indicate that the
only crime that increased, at least in Great Britain, was the
State-manufactured crime of taking drugs itself. </p>

<h5>D. Cost of law enforcement increased. </h5>

<p>If any crime other than the artificial crime of taking drugs
itself increased it was caused by competition for wealth, power
including negotiable influence, i.e., influence that can be
converted to wealth or power, and negotiable fame. Drugs have
nothing to do with our need for law enforcement. Perhaps, if
everybody &quot;turned on and tuned in&quot;, we wouldn't need
law enforcement or, for that matter, armed forces. This view is
as good (and better if one reads my book [5]) as any other view
until proven otherwise. I remain confident that no such proof is
forthcoming as I have proved (in my book) the view supported by
myself as well as social theorems are ever proved (without the
absolute necessity to employ drugs to achieve the spiritual
revolution of which I have spoken). </p>

<h5>E. Addicts will burden welfare and the health-care sector. </h5>

<p>If, as we demand, drug users are given the same opportunities
as everyone else, they will out-perform everybody. No experiment
to disprove that has ever been attempted even though it is easy
to design one. (Remember, the drug users must be free of any
negative expectations or social stigma or fear of social
retaliation or demonization or scapegoating during the trials of
their effectiveness at tasks of their own choosing.) So much for
welfare. </p>

<p>The health-care issue is settled. Prohibitionists can't have
it both ways. Either drugs will shorten lives or they won't. If
they don't, drug users are as likely or more likely to contribute
to health care (by virtue of their genius) and less likely to
burden the system as many will choose to doctor themselves. </p>

<h4>IV. CRACK BABIES </h4>

<p>Let's wait six months to a year. I can virtually guarantee
that, by then, so-called crack babies will prove to be yet
another myth surrounding drugs - in a category similar to
&quot;reefer madness&quot;. See below. </p>

<h4>V. MONEY </h4>

<p>As will be shown, the money is in prohibition. What will all
the quacks, charlatans, and parasites do when peace breaks out?
The ineptness of drug users that is supposed to cause workplace
accidents has no scientific basis as in the previous cases. </p>

<h4>VI. MORALS </h4>

<p>The American government and the Christian right are not
qualified to comment upon morals. The moral position is held by <i>us</i>
as will be made abundantly clear as the argument unfolds. </p>

<h4>VII. MEDICAL USES OF SO-CALLED ILLEGAL DRUGS </h4>

<p>The DEA opposes the medical use of certain drugs for their own
political reasons only. This is criminal. They wish to pretend
that they can make certain drugs go away completely. The War on
Drugs has been amazingly successful in demonizing drugs and drug
users. (I can hear Chomsky saying, &quot;Goebbels would be
impressed&quot;, which is not something I would write.) However,
in stopping the flow of drugs it has been a dismal
&quot;failure&quot;. I predicted [5] that we would see new
horrors and we have seen them. Too many people have too much to
lose if drugs disappear. The DEA, itself, will never let that
happen! So, the typical pro-legalization cant that the War on
Drugs has failed is only half right and by no means the best
half. Personally, I think the DEA has achieved nearly every goal
on its agenda. </p>

<h4>VIII. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS </h4>

<p>The DEA claims that individual rights must bow to the
potential harm done by a few; however, it seems that the
trampling of human rights itself is the <i>raison d'être</i>. A
free people do not permit the punishment of people before they
commit a crime and the prohibition of drugs is just that. For
many of us, it is a draconian punishment that we shall struggle
against as we would struggle against the worst sort of tyranny -
for which drug prohibition is a good candidate. No measures
should be ruled out in a struggle for an essential element of our
humanity, e.g., the ability to make our own decisions, which is
part of the definition of freedom, cf., The Random House
Dictionary [6]: </p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size="2"><b>Definition (Freedom).</b>
<i>Freedom</i> is the exemption from external control,
interference, regulation, etc. It is the power of determining
one's own actions or making one's own decisions.</font></font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">IX. LEGAL ASPECTS</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">The difficulties suggested by the DEA can be
overcome easily. We still have Fletcher's Doctrine, so nobody
gets away with anything. The Food and Drug Administration can
advise and we are certain to take its advice into account.
However, desperate people may take desperate measures if they
wish, e.g., those dying from AIDS. Pharmaceutical companies and
other drug manufacturers must continue to bear responsibility for
what they do - as do we all. Nothing new here.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">The Meaning of the Word Addiction Is Not Made
Clear </h3>

<p><font size="2">In Chapter 1, below, I have defined nine types
of addiction, which does not constitute an exhaustive list. When
the DEA compares the rates at which given substances addict,
i.e., the fractions of people who having used at all become
addicted, they are comparing apples with oranges if the types of
addiction are widely disparate. For example, comparing the
addiction rate of cocaine to that of nicotine is nonsense, as the
short-term addictive effect of cocaine is gone once one elects to
sleep. On the other hand, nicotine withdrawal is normally
accompanied by painful symptoms that make the victim unfit for
human companionship in many cases. In real life in the fast lane
of rock music, we rarely encounter severe cocaine withdrawal
symptoms. The psychological dependence is merely the regret one
experiences when one must forego a gratifying and delightful
experience. This kicks in when the physiological withdrawal is
over and its unpleasantness depends entirely on the individual
and not at all on the drug.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If I wished to add an amusing tenth type of
addiction to the list below, I would consider an entirely
separate type of addiction that is added intentionally to a
medication, such as blood pressure medication, that must be taken
daily, but, by itself, provides no gratification that impels one
toward a healthful regularity in one's use. I wish the drug
company would add something addictive to my Indiral so that I
wouldn't forget to take it. I have just given an example of an
addiction that is useful and wholesome. Evidently, the
demonization of addiction is irrational and those who use
addiction always in a dyslogistic sense have fallen into a
logical trap.</font> </p>

<h2>CHAPTER BY CHAPTER REBUTTAL </h2>

<h3 align="center">The Introduction to the DEA Document </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA expects us to prove that the benefits
of legalization outweigh its costs, however benefits and costs
may be noncomparable when a moral imperative is involved.
Generally, the DEA will be concerned with length of life as
opposed to quality of life. The notion that some suffering is
worthwhile is lost on them. Their question about using drug
addiction as a defense in a trial is answered by the Fletcher
Doctrine above. Finally, they wish to dictate the terms of the
debate. Naturally we shall insist that the terms of the debate be
negotiated between us and we shall have something to say about
them.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter One: Addiction Rates and Drug
Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">I don't use the argument that drug use will go
down and, frankly, in some cases, I hope it goes up. We can make
the best drugs available and, quite naturally, users will choose
the better drugs over those with serious drawbacks. If powder
cocaine and new syringes are readily available, the use of crack
cocaine might well disappear. Further, legal research should turn
up even better drugs with few, if any, drawbacks.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cocaine is said to be much more addictive than
alcohol and yet some experts [7] claim that cocaine is not
addictive at all. I have classified cocaine under Case 2 (below),
short-term addiction, and Case 4, pseudo-addiction, you enjoy an
experience so you wish to repeat it. Years ago, no one considered
cocaine addictive, mainly because there are no withdrawal
symptoms. The &quot;violent psychotic behavior&quot; they
associate with cocaine is almost never seen in practice. Make
them state incidence rates and how they were obtained. The reason
that there is &quot;no effective, permanent treatment&quot; for
cocaine use is simple. Cocaine use is not a disease! Naturally,
some people want to medicalize everything. There's gold in them
thar hills. For the record, I include my short list of types of
addiction together with a brief analysis of how well they fit the
definition of disease [8].</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I have compiled a short list of phenomena that
are sometimes referred to as (or mistaken for) drug addiction:
(1) self-medication for chronic depression or chronic pain, (2)
taking a drug that causes a symptom that can be relieved only by
taking more of the drug or by the passage of a few hours, (3)
acute withdrawal symptoms that last several days, (4) dedication
to the repetition of a pleasurable experience regardless of
long-range consequences, (5) taking a drug to perform a task,
which might have to be performed several times a week, perhaps to
make a living, (6) obligatory daily performance of a task that
cannot be performed during withdrawal from a drug, (7) using
drugs to isolate oneself from the painful realities of life in a
bad world, (8) unwillingness to pass an opportunity to take drugs
because the law may cut off one's supply, (9) the case of a drug
that, like valium or blood-pressure medication, poses a health
risk if one forgets to take it in the absence of a craving that
(blessedly) reminds one to take it. In Case 1, a physician may
prescribe another drug, Case 2 is normal and involves a conscious
choice between two alternatives on the part of the individual,
Case 3 might require supervised tapering off or the prescription
of other drugs, Cases 4-8 are behavioral choices in the face of
circumstances that are beyond a therapist's control. I do not
believe any of the cases correspond to what we normally call a
disease. Case 9 is a normal medical situation and stretches the
meaning of addiction seriously, but may not be omitted as it
constitutes a requirement to take the drug, which, in this case
and in this case alone, is strictly medical.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug abuse usually refers to some type of
behavior of which other people do not approve but which is
consistent with the goals of the user, who might be a criminal or
only an oddball. The term &quot;denial&quot; is a fallacious
appeal to the authority of the treatment community in a dispute
with a user who is insufficiently articulate to defend his values
and motives. The term &quot;denial&quot; is an impostor term.
When the user himself disapproves of his own behavior, the term
&quot;drug abuse&quot; might make sense, unless the user is a
victim of anti-drug propaganda. Many people who have tried to
stop taking drugs might benefit from the friendship and advice of
other drug users. As suggested by Henman [9], drug use must be
looked at from the perspective of the user.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We are told marijuana is stronger nowadays. So,
take less! Also, label it honestly. If anything, its strength
will be exaggerated, by establishment growers. <i>Especially</i>
by establishment growers! Also, remind people that you needn't
smoke it. The THC can be extracted with butter and drunk with
coffee or even milk. (Never try to extract it with water, of
course. It's not soluble in water.) If they use the argument that
the commercial product Marinol, which contains THC, lists
numerous side effects associated with THC. Just pull out the
blurb that goes with a common prescription medicine that is
normally deemed safe and see how long the list is for <i>it</i>.
I would choose Imitrex, which cures migraine headaches, the total
number of side effects listed is thirty-four, unless I
miscounted. Remember, any symptom that is reported by as many as
1% of the test group and appeared at least as frequently as it
did in the placebo group must be listed. If they tell you
marijuana impairs sexual function, ask them if they are worried
about low birth rates. That's the kind of shifting of priorities
that they are fond of doing when it suits them. Just what is it
they don't want to happen? Do they really care more about the
health of junkies or about the property of the affluent? If they
tell you drug use drives up medical costs, ask them how much they
spend on the indigent compared to the well-heeled. Of course,
early death, if it really occurs, reduces consumption of scarce
resources, e.g., gasoline. Obviously, the ill effects of
marijuana are never seen in the real world - only in the labs of
over-zealous &quot;scientists&quot; anxious to ingratiate
themselves with funding agencies, who, it must be admitted, are
rarely run by hippies.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, they use the term &quot;common
sense&quot; in a fallacious way and refer to &quot;misery and
death&quot;, which occurs only rarely among sensible users. It is
worth noting that the increase in use foreseen by some is mere
speculation at best as no one can predict the future in this
case. They have no scientific theory upon which to base their
predictions.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Two. Crime and Drug Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">Once again, at the beginning of this chapter,
the DEA claims that some drugs, notably crack and PCP, cause
violent and anti-social behavior. First of all, ask with what
frequency. This behavior is virtually never seen in the real
world. If pressed, I could indicate, from personal experience and
the experience of friends and acquaintances, how exceedingly rare
this behavior must be as it is never witnessed by me or anyone I
know. Even if a few did exhibit such anti-social behavior,
society may not punish everyone for the actions of a few - and I
mean a very few. Alcohol is the drug that causes violent and
anti-social behavior,<i> particularly if the user has seen armed
combat</i>.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA divides crime associated with drugs
into three categories: purchase-related crime, drug-induced
crime, and black market crime, which I shall consider separately
as they do.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">PURCHASE-RELATED CRIME</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">They claim, at the outset, that drugs are cheap
now, which is far from the case - even for a middle-class user.
They claim that prices might not go down, therefore
purchase-related crime (crimes committed to get the money to buy
the drugs) would not decrease. However, establishment drug firms
have the technology to produce drugs cheaply and they might find
themselves in heavy competition as no patents can be held on the
traditional drugs. Moreover, they would have no research costs to
defray. (Research on marijuana has already been done by the
underground - and done well, I might add. Tobacco growers would
benefit immediately from this knowledge.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">First the DEA claims that purchase-related
crime would not decrease because prices would not go down. Next,
they claim that, if prices go down, use would increase, so
purchase-related crime would rise proportionately. Possibly use
would increase, and I hope it would, as drug use improves people
in my experience. But, the price should be sufficiently reduced
that the cost of the saturation dose would not be prohibitive to
poor people even, who manage to find the price of a pack of
cigarettes. At one point in the argument, the DEA claims property
crime goes up with drug use - essentially for no reason at all.
This won't wash as all the conditions will have changed and no
such general rule can be justified.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Of course, if hard pressed, poor people will
steal just to live, but that's another problem, namely, poverty
itself, which had better be solved and solved soon. But, nothing
the DEA recommends will solve poverty. People who cannot get
drugs do not have a better chance to get decent work than drug
users would in a normalized situation. The trouble is in the
economy and has nothing to do with drugs. In fact, the drug war
can be explained as a tactic to draw attention away from real
problems.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">DRUG-INDUCED CRIME</font> </h4>

<p><font size="2">Drug testing of people arrested for putative
crime proves nothing about drugs causing crime. This is the
well-known <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> (after this therefore
because of this) fallacy. (The fallaceous assumption is that
everything that happens after some distinguished event is caused
by it.) The DEA statement that, &quot;Drugs changed their
behavior, enabled, and encouraged them to act violently and
irrationally,&quot; is completely unsupported and has been
dismissed by my earlier remarks. The authors of the DEA arguments
are shameful in their use of deceptive and inflammatory rhetoric.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">They often bring up crack, a drug that I, for
one, shall assiduously avoid; however, they neglect the role of
the drug war in encouraging the invention of crack as a marketing
gimmick. If Squibb would provide a wide menu of cocaine products
other than crack, the use of crack would probably disappear, as
it is not a very good drug and users would choose better ones.</font><font
color="#0000FF"><font size="2"> </font></font><font
color="#000000"><font size="2">Moreover, the research of Schama
et al. [10] will disprove the existence of crack babies - unless
I am very much mistaken.</font></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug-induced crime is largely a myth. The DEA
has no case here. The constitutional rights of (otherwise) law
abiding citizens may not be denied due to the behavior of a few
exceptional people who would probably commit crimes with or
without drugs. No scientifically verified mechanistic link has
been established between taking drugs and committing crimes.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA says, &quot;Drugs changed [drug users]
behavior, enabled and encouraged them to act violently and
irrationally.&quot; Presumably, this would not occur except in
psychotic individuals, however it is well known that psychotic
people are incapable of coping with the exigencies of habitual
drug use with all its complicated business of obtaining money,
copping, and dealing with diverse and complicated people. Thus,
people who are likely to behave irrationally will not be able to
take illegal drugs on a consistent basis such that the fears
retailed by the DEA would be at all realistic. <i>Fear</i> of
people going crazy on drugs is the only irrational behavior one
is likely to encounter in connection with drugs. It is no stretch
of logic to claim that the DEA is driving Americans crazy by
inducing mass hysteria and unjustified fear of drugs, dealers,
and users.</font> </p>

<h4><font size="2">BLACK MARKET CRIME</font> </h4>

<p><a name="bmcrime"><font size="2">It is patently absurd to
imagine the black market competing with Parke-Davis unless
punitive taxes are levied, which would be unfair and unwise. It's
not likely that the Cali cartel has the muscle (or ruthlessness)
to take on multi-national corporations, most of which can put a
creditable army in the field if it serves their selfish interests
to do so. The Cali cartel is a midget compared to Squibb. This is
the DEA's silliest argument - so far; but, don't worry, they will
top themselves.</font></a> </p>

<p><font size="2">Children are bound to get drugs from adults
under any scenario unless they can be convinced not to - black
market or no. I believe the best an honest educator can do is
steer kids to the better and less harmful drugs and teach them
how to use drugs effectively and safely. The schools presently
are incapable of offering an educational alternative that can
compete with drugs with their power to attune our sensibilities
to the best that our culture has to offer and make worthwhile
subjects intensely interesting. All that the schools offer is
lies, drudgery, boredom, and all the wrong stuff. Kids who take
drugs are much more likely to take an interest in scholarship and
art than are squares. Personally, I don't want my kids attending
any school I can think of - not Harvard, not any of them - and I
have taught in four universities and attended many more including
the elite academies. Frankly, I don't see many important
differences among them. They are all bad.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Three. The Experience of Foreign
Countries and Drug Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not intend to use this argument, but I
must comment on some of the specious arguments in this chapter.
The DEA claims that &quot;legalization did not work&quot; in any
foreign country. They neglect to say what they mean by
&quot;work&quot;. In some cases, it worked for me. In the
paragraph on Great Britain, the DEA refers to the journal <i>Lancet</i>,
but they don't give us a reference directly to <i>Lancet</i>.
Rather, they refer to a letter, which, we, of course, would not
be able to find in our library. This simply makes it impossible
to determine if they have quoted <i>Lancet</i> correctly - if
they have evaluated the conclusions of the <i>Lancet</i> article
fairly. From experience, acquired in this booklet, we know better
than to trust the DEA. They are dishonest and must be watched
carefully in everything they say and do. In fact, every single
reference at the end of this chapter is clearly biased in favor
of their position. This is typical of the references, as I have
said before. Even references to university studies are tainted,
as the sponsors and/or the directors of the institute doing the
study are far from disinterested - to the everlasting shame of
all who profess science as their field of endeavor. Science: once
sacred, is now a tool of the wickedest people on earth.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Later in the section on Great Britain, we are
told that only 20% of the &quot;addicts&quot; participate in
methadone programs. They conclude that the reason for this is
that heroin is a better drug. Almost certainly, street heroin is
a much worse drug. The true answer undoubtedly is the
dehumanization one experiences in any drug &quot;program&quot;
or, for that matter, any government program of any type. That is
why this author will never submit to a decriminalization plan
with controls of any kind. This is why anti-prohibitionists who
advise against asking for complete legalization and decontrol
(and, perforce, rejecting any halfway measure) are part of the
problem not part of the solution. We have a moral imperative.
There shall be no compromise - even if it means all-out war.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Next, we are told that, while the clinical
heroin experiment in Great Britain was going on, the death rate
of heroin addicts was twenty-six times the average for the
population. Firstly, I don't believe them (the reference is a
letter that refers to an article in <i>The New Republic</i>,
which is <i>not</i> a refereed scientific journal); and,
secondly, why would they care, as they are obviously against drug
addicts. Undoubtedly, a considerable portion of whatever excess
death rate the addicts <i>do</i> enjoy is caused by the laws
against drugs, which is proved in Appendix C. This is typical of
the way in which this booklet switches objectives whenever the
authors find that a new objective is useful to make a point. If I
prove that result A will be achieved by legalization, they
suddenly abandon A as an objective and look for a new objective
that will be met less well by legalization than by a bad law. We
are told that when the British &quot;programs&quot; were in
operation Scotland Yard had to double its <i>narcotics</i> <i>division</i>
&quot;to cope with the increased crime rate&quot;. [emphasis
mine] It appears, then, that the crime they are concerned about
is taking drugs itself, which, of course, would not be a crime if
they had not made it a crime artificially.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA equates success with less drugs
consumed and fewer users. But, clearly, they are not concerned at
all with the quality of life of users, which they do everything
they can do to diminish. In the Netherlands, they are concerned
about an increase in property crime, but one wonders what laws
were passed in the Netherlands, or anywhere, making it illegal to
refuse employment to a person merely because he or she uses
drugs, regardless of his effectiveness. I, for example, can do
nearly anything better stoned than anyone else can do it not
stoned - to put it modestly. I claim that nearly anyone can find
a drug or combination of drugs that will enhance his performance.
That's why so many athletes take drugs when they play, or,
rather, used to before the systematic persecution and invasion of
privacy of drug users (through testing) forced its nasty
tentacles deep into sports.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I shall not go into the experiences of other
countries or cities with partial decriminalization, mainly
because it is nearly impossible to find out what really happened
and, furthermore, it's irrelevant. Whatever the DEA says, we
shall have to check it carefully as they are so dishonest. After
all, they are fighting to protect lucrative jobs with virtually
unlimited opportunities for corrupt practices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the summary of Chapter 3, we read, &quot;In
Iran and Thailand, countries where drugs are readily available,
the prevalence of addiction has been and continues to be
exceptionally high.&quot; Why don't they tell us how high? The
last two sentences are as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1.) Both the Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of
1971 (both signed by the U.S.) insist that drugs should not be
legalized. [&quot;Issues and Comments to respond to Legalization
of Illegal Drugs.&quot; Drug Enforcement Administration, May
1988].</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2.) The International Narcotics Control Board
of the United Nations concluded that &quot;legalization advocates
have not yet presented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent or
viable alternative to the present system of international
drug-abuse control.&quot; [&quot;Report of the International
Control Board for 1992,&quot; United Nations Publication].</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Undoubtedly, these are true statements and I
think they deserve a comment. They are indicative of the great
control exercised by the United States in international politics,
including the United Nations, which has become little more than a
tool of U.S. aggression and imperialism. We have become the
all-time world's greatest bully - a nation of puritanical
hypocrites willing to impose intolerance and bigotry wherever it
suits our &quot;interests&quot;, namely, the continued predation
of the largely U.S.-based multi-national corporations. It isn't
just drugs of which we are intolerant; it's any form of
self-determination among the weaker nations and any form of
democracy, be it capitalist or communist. Of course, since the
only path to true democracy lies through some type of communism,
every democratic movement arising from the people will be
interpreted as communism, perhaps rightly. I don't have to say
much to support this picture of the world as it really is. This
has been done for me by Noam Chomsky with hundreds of details
painstakingly documented [11,12,13, ... ]. The War on Drugs is
only the tip of a gigantic iceberg.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Four: The Economics of Drug
Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not use the argument that drug
legalization will provide tax revenue. Drugs should not be taxed
as they are a necessity of life. Food is taxed in Utah. Shame!
Normally, the necessities of life are not taxed. In civilized
jurisdictions, they are never taxed. But, I must comment on the
falsity employed by the DEA - even in this pointless argument.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Again, we see a reference to so-called crack
babies. When the Emory University studies [10] are finally
published, and the detractors have been silenced, this myth will
be put to rest for all time. I shall rewrite this section at that
time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is again concerned about lost
productivity even though they have done nothing to ensure that
drug users have jobs if they want them. Again, they make the
unsupported claim that drug use is responsible for workplace
accidents. The fact that Conrail train operators had used
marijuana may have had nothing to do with the accident that they
constantly harp on. I pointed out that just because events
coincide does not prove that one is the cause of the other. This
is a logical fallacy. In the chemical industry, which I know best
and where the accidents are of apocalyptic proportions,
management pays lip service only to the prevention of accidents.
Certainly, measures are taken, but the main cause of accidents is
not addressed, namely, the hiring of contract workers to avoid
paying benefits. Many of these workers do not read the language
in which the safety and operating manuals are written. Until this
outrage is corrected, all bets are off concerning workplace
accidents.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I wish to express a sentiment peculiar to
myself to close my comments on economics. As far as I am
concerned drug users ought to be able to occupy themselves
exclusively with art if they so desire. Even fifty million drug
users supported by the rest of the work force does not seem
excessive to me. We have too many people working. The economy is
too large to be in harmony with nature. It is destroying the
environment. For those of you who feel you should not have to
support drug users, let me remind you that we haven't even
addressed the slight matter of reparations for the inconvenience
we have suffered due to unconstitutional and immoral laws against
drugs. I, personally, would be satisfied with $100,000 per year
for the life of myself and my wife, however many will want much
more - perhaps a one-time payment of fifty million 1996 U.S.
dollars?</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Five: The Lessons of Prohibition and
Drug Legalization </h3>

<p><font size="2">In a recent talk, Jerry Epstein of the Drug
Policy Forum of Texas pointed out that the difficulty we are
encountering in ending drug prohibition exceeds the difficulty
encountered in ending alcohol prohibition simply because the
people who remember what it was like before drug prohibition are
all dead, whereas the people who repealed alcohol prohibition
remembered the period before Prohibition vividly. If the vast
majority of the body politic remembered that drugs were not a
serious problem when they were legal, we would have an easy time
repealing the laws against drugs. By the way, they would remember
why the drug laws were enacted and they would realize, now that
racism has fallen into bad repute, that the drugs were enacted
for all the wrong reasons. Furthermore, it took a constitutional
amendment to prohibit alcohol. Why did it not require a
constitutional amendment to prohibit drugs? Clearly, a
constitutional amendment was required but conveniently by-passed,
as it would not have passed muster in any rational court.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other than these observations, I have nothing
to say about the lessons of Prohibition. Thus, the DEA is
preparing to defend itself against an argument I will not make.
Apparently, the DEA has availed itself of &quot;recent historical
evidence&quot;. Why should <i>new</i> evidence about past events
be more reliable than whatever evidence has been available since
the time of Prohibition! I am skeptical of all such evidence
whether it furthers my case or not.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is more useful to me to hang the DEA with
its own arguments. They seem to think that the majority favors
drug prohibition, which somehow justifies prohibition. On the
contrary, the tyranny of the majority must be rejected along with
every other form of tyranny. What I think, though, is that, not
only do the majority favor drug legalization, the majority uses
illegal drugs. I think it is amusing to contemplate the
possibility that, if every user came out of the closet, the set
of users might turn out to be <i>everyone</i>! Ha!</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In Appendix B, I shall place Bob Ramsey's list
of great men and women (mostly men) who have used drugs
habitually. This may interest those who imagine that the
persecution of drug users will have no unintended social effects.
If all of our great men were put in jail, society would certainly
suffer - embarrassment at the very least.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Six: The Role of Alcohol and Tobacco
in the Drug Legalization Debate </h3>

<p><font size="2">I will add caffeine to that list. Can you
imagine how office workers would react to a ban on caffeine! I am
not suggesting that these other drugs should be made illegal or
demonized. I am sympathetic with smokers, particularly those who
began smoking before the general propaganda campaign to
discourage smoking began. However, one must really wonder about
smokers who are so stupid as to congregate near the doorways of
buildings to smoke, since that is an area through which <i>everyone</i>
who enters or leaves the building must pass. Why would they want
to lose the few sympathizers they have among nonsmokers when it
would cost them only a minimal additional effort to walk a few
paces away from the building entrances? I suppose it is unfair to
remark that quitting smoking cost me no effort worth mentioning,
I suppose I am immune to addiction. Actually, I can take any drug
or leave it. Arguments that hinge upon addiction, crime, health,
etc. don't apply to me; so, presumably, neither should the laws.
Actually, I am uncomfortable with the laws against drunk driving
because of the large number of drivers who drive well - even
better - while intoxicated. This must be a very large class of
drivers, extending perhaps, to everyone on the road after
midnight every Saturday night / Sunday morning, otherwise how
would they get home from the bars? It seems to me that the law
should not kick in until actual harm is done. I cite the Fletcher
Doctrine, stated above.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The DEA seems unprepared for my claim that the
legality of alcohol, the blood of Christ, and the illegality of
peyote, marijuana, etc. is a violation of the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. Other than that I remark only that
the DEA argument is typically silly, but I do not wish to go into
what is obvious. Let me list a few fallacious statements from
each of the remaining chapters even though I do not use the
argument with which the chapter deals. By now the reader can tell
the author what's wrong with these statements. Let's leave such
criticism as exercises for the reader.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;Cocaine debases the user's life.&quot;</b>
Is that what they think? If it does, it is only because they say
so. And, they are willing to say anything regardless of whether
it makes sense or not. I am not nor have I been guilty of the <i>ad
hominem</i> fallacy. The drug warriors <i>really are wicked</i>.
The general public ought to see them for what they are. They
discredit their own arguments by employing dishonest and immoral
methods to promote their own selfish interests. If their
arguments were valid, they would not have to resort to such
tactics.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;[T]obacco does not affect one's
intellectual processing or decision-making ability.&quot;</b> So
what! It is not clear that these other drugs affect them except
possibly to improve them. In most cases, the most popular illegal
drugs definitely enhance the IQs of most users. Users for whom
this is not true usually haven't much intellectual ability to
begin with. Personally, I don't think such people should be using
drugs, but I am not prepared to tell them they may not; and, from
time to time, they will surprise me with an outstanding
intellectual leap, which, probably, they could not have made
without drugs. Nobody has any evidence that is worth citing in a
scientific debate.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As Professor [James Q.] Wilson explains [Notice
that what follows is in no way an <i>explanation</i>, which by
itself makes the <i>entire</i> statement a <i>flat-out lie</i>.],
<b>&quot;Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it.
Nicotine alters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul </b>[which
Prof. Wilson knows from measurements on his soul-o-meter].<b> The
heavy use of crack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodes
those natural sentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute our
human nature and make possible our social life.&quot;</b> [When a
man uses the word &quot;duty&quot; in this manner &quot;stand not
on the order of your leaving but leave immediately&quot;. Please,
Prof. Wilson, spare me your society.] Professor Wilson's opinion
is worthless. Quoting &quot;authority&quot; is the weakest type
of argument and may safely be dismissed. One can always find
someone as stupid as oneself.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">See my article on academia [14], to understand
why I don't think college professors deserve the respect of
ordinary people. During the last few decades, they seem to have
become incorrigibly stupid. I have deliberately dissociated
myself from all but a few with whom I remain on civil terms.
These few are cynical enough concerning the intellectual
abilities of the rest. I have been attending seminars at Rice
University, lately, to correct all the stupid things that are
said - except in mathematics, where profound stupidity has not
yet carried the day. But, more and more, I despair of being
understood. Occasionally, one or two receptive minds can be
found, but only on rare occasions. The drivel one hears is beyond
what anyone could imagine only a few short years ago, but
academia has succumbed to the cesspool mentality almost
completely. The college students, even in the prestige academies,
are pathetic, especially those who come from homes that allow
television viewing. (PBS, even, is an unmitigated intellectual
disaster.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I honestly see no point in being diplomatic in
this effort to change people's minds. No good will come from
adopting partial truths or downright falsehood as Madison Avenue
and the mainstream culture have done. I should expound at greater
length on this attitude of uncompromising truth regardless of
consequences, that is, truth as we perceive it - recognizing that
we are fallible.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;And although cholesterol may kill you,
it does not lead to the types of bizarre, destructive behavior
that is associated with most illegal drugs.&quot;</b> Refute this
as an exercise. (Why should not the reader get a chance to
participate in the slaying of monsters of falsehood?)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[W]e should compare the risks of alcohol
and tobacco [don't forget caffeine] with those of legalized
cocaine and marijuana.&quot; [Fair enough] <b>&quot;Likely, we
would find that the latter are much more dangerous than the
former.&quot;</b> False; say why as an exercise.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>&quot;[A]lcohol, while admittedly,
dangerous, is much less addictive than presently illegal drugs
and also is easier to quit once addicted.&quot;</b> Criticize as
an exercise. Hint: Add what we said about the definition(s) of
addiction to the other falsehoods in this sentence.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Seven: Medical Uses of Presently
Illegal Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">Criticize this chapter as an exercise unless
you find its illogical point of view and other faults too
obvious. Hints: (1) They call what <i>we</i> say
&quot;propaganda&quot;. We admit to that, but wonder if they
think that what they say is &quot;education&quot;. (2) One can <i>drink</i>
marijuana. (3) Appeal to authority is the fallacy known as <i>ad
verecundiam</i>, i.e., toward modesty - your modesty.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Eight: Individual Rights and the
Legalization of Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not refer to John Stuart Mill, so it's no
good pawning his remarks off on me. I have made an irrefutable
constitutional argument. It remains only to examine the majority
and minority opinions in the case law that reached the Supreme
Court of which, I would venture to say, very little exists;
however, I may be in for a surprise, a surprise I can handle. The
majority opinions that ruled against my positions must involve
unconscionable assaults on logic. These can easily be refuted
with whatever slight aid I expect from the minority opinions. No,
Your Honors, &quot;I'm not trying to show contempt for this
court, I'm doing my best to hide it.&quot; My contempt knows no
bounds, thus it's impossible to hide it. What will they arrest me
for, contempt of word processor - to take a page from Tom Wolfe.
I have no fear that the Supreme Court will defeat my argument in
the higher court of unfettered reason.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">They will try to establish compelling reasons
why these violations of the Constitution are essential to the
commonwealth of the United States. We shall not allow that the
government has a right to regulate the health and personal safety
of its citizens against their will. We can raise an army in no
time that will put down that heresy. (Obviously, such armies are
already out there in force - although they are rarely informed by
the highest principles.) Other sections of this paper will
disqualify nearly every compelling reason they are likely to come
up with. If they pull something new, it will be just as specious
as the rest and I can refute it on my feet under as much pressure
as they wish to put to bear. One must realize that, although they
wield immense raw force, they are basically little people -
barely more than children and they have not had a valid thought
in years. They are almost nobody - in the existential sense. We
should not fear them, rather, we should get busy and get them out
of there. We can certainly contrive to arrange <i>that</i> if we
apply our minds and exercise a little moral resolution.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">They have repeated my argument in their
&quot;little book&quot;. They claim our freedom <i>does</i>
interfere with the freedom and well-being of others. (They use
the weak phrase &quot;affect other people&quot; to which we might
respond: So what! But, for the sake of argument, we shall grant
that they mean that the effect is to interfere with the freedom
of other people, and we shall use this concept in the widest
possible sense giving them every opportunity to make a valid
case, which they cannot do.) In my philosophical papers, I have
shown how to disqualify imaginary offenses, i.e., offenses that
would not occur if the mental outlook of the victim were
different. For example, a mother is distraught because she has
learned that her son is homosexual. Her pain is caused by her
intolerance and misunderstanding of the situation. It cannot be
said that he is interfering with her freedom or &quot;hurting
her&quot; in a way from which she can be protected by the State.
I will take their arguments one at a time and finish with the
most common situation of all, namely, the case of the wife who
claims to be suffering because her husband gets high.</font> </p>

<h2>CRIME </h2>

<p><font size="2">Earlier, I have shown that the argument that
drug use increases crime is invalid. Even if drug use <i>did</i>
lead to crime on occasion, the Wayburn Doctrine invalidates
punishing every drug user for the behavior of a few.</font> </p>

<h2>DAMAGE TO THE UNBORN </h2>

<p><font size="2">The epidemiological data suffers from the
well-known fallacy <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i>. But, most
compelling, the study by Schama et al. [10], which is mechanistic
(rather than epidemiological), has good controls, employs more
than adequate variation in conditions, subjects the young monkeys
to a wide range of accepted psychological tests, and is being
performed using the strictest scientific procedures to avoid an
embarrassment when it is subjected to (expected) harsh scrutiny
by drug warriors subsequent to publication, this study, I say,
pretty much shows that <b>there is no such thing as crack babies</b>.
I have known this for years from vast personal, albeit anecdotal,
experience, namely, nearly daily observation of the pregnant
mothers throughout their pregnancies - observations that the drug
warriors never have at their disposal. The plain truth about much
science funded by the public is that it can be replaced without
loss by introspection and casual observation. This is especially
true of the so-called social sciences and a large part of medical
research even. I do not intend to tar everyone with the same
brush. Notable and laudable exceptions exist. However, research
that is sponsored by government agencies or other parties with
vested interest in the outcome, e.g., a study of the carcinogenic
effects of chemicals sponsored by Dow and DuPont, <b>is not
science!</b></font> </p>

<h2>CHILD ABUSE </h2>

<p><font size="2">This, again, is the fallacy of <i>post hoc ergo
propter hoc</i>. Drug users almost never abuse children. Poverty
abuses children. Capitalism abuses children. Instances of child
abuse by drug users must be so rare that to punish every drug
user for their crimes is an outrageous abuse of law. Punish child
abusers when they abuse children - if the government has the
remotest idea what constitutes child abuse, which I doubt. This,
by the way, is an equivocal way of using the term abuse in a
booklet that employs the term drug abuse. What do they mean, then
by drug abuse? Striking a pill with a blunt instrument or merely
yelling at a bag of cocaine? These people are such terrible liars
and morons. They deserve our utmost contempt. (This paper is not
calculated to make friends among them. To the drug warriors, as
W.C. Fields would say, &quot;<i>I hate you!</i>&quot;)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The horror stories can be attributed one-by-one
to the War on Drugs and, of course, Capitalism, itself, which is
behind the War. I suppose the rich old men are afraid that young
hip drug users might refuse once more to dress up in soldier
suits and go out and be killed (and kill those with whom they
share the same old men as enemies) to make the old men and their
families richer still at the expense of themselves and their own
families. I find it ironic that, in the case of our armed
aggression against the people of Viet Nam, our boys went out as
squares and came back hip junkies, knowing the score even if it
cost them a limb or two, unless, of course, they were killed -
or, rather, murdered by the same company that brings you, now,
The Drug War, in living color.</font> </p>

<h2>AUTO ACCIDENTS </h2>

<p><font size="2">The DEA paragraph on this topic begins by
asserting that a large percentage (how large?) of automobile
accidents in the U.S. is caused by marijuana. They think they
know this - or, perhaps, they think they can convince us of this
- by doing drug testing <i>after</i> the accident. This is <i>post
hoc ergo propter hoc</i>, which proves nothing; it doesn't even
give us a clue. What percentage of drivers who didn't get in
accidents were high on grass? I'll tell you what: I'll put my
bunch of vipers, higher than kites, in a driving contest against
a random bunch of squares. I'm not going to let you employ the
Penske team, naturally, that's why I say random. It is easy to
design a fair experiment to determine if drug use causes
impairment of driving skills, for example; however, no such
experiment will be conducted. The authorities will not provide
immunity, remove the stigma, the social expectations, and past
demonization and scapegoating of drugs and drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Contrary to the DEA claim, the Conrail accident
probably had nothing to do with pot. I say this with confidence.
No one has even remotely proved that it did. Would you like to
discuss the evidence? No unbiased scientific experiment has ever
been carried out to study the effects of drugs! Nor is it likely
that such an experiment can or will be carried out until drugs
are legalized and drug use is normalized.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The last statement in the (DEA) paragraph under
consideration is just plain ludicrous on the face of it. That's
why we know these drug warriors are plain old-fashioned liars -
desperately trying to hold on to their lucrative (very lucrative,
I opine) jobs that are not and never were needed. Can you say
parasite? Here's the statement: &quot;Furthermore, a study
conducted by Stanford University found that twenty-four hours
after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a
plane.&quot; The reference is the <i>Drug Awareness Information
Newsletter</i>, undoubtedly another bunch of liars, but certainly
not a reviewed scientific journal. Now, after making a
sensational claim like this, why wouldn't they give us a
reference to the actual study? Twenty-four hours after smoking a
joint, hardly anyone can distinguish a difference from the way he
felt before he smoked the joint. Given this indisputable everyday
fact, why should we ever get in a plane knowing that the pilot is
unable to discern by feelings alone whether he is capable of
landing it? How did they get permission to carry out this test
legally? Who would carry it out <i>illegally</i>? I know the
president of Stanford might divert research funds to luxuries for
his personal use, but illegally fly planes ... ? This is the
dumbest thing in the book! (The only reason I am bothering with
people whose only logic is bullets is that I promised someone I
would do it.) The people who wrote this book are dishonest. Go
ahead sue me for libel. It ain't libel if it's true. (Any
suggested advocacy anywhere in this paper - or in any other paper
by this author - of illegal acts by the author or others is to be
construed as humor, naturally.)</font> </p>

<h2>MONEY </h2>

<h3 align="center">Lost Productivity </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA claims that drugs cost the nation money
due to lost productivity. This reveals, already, an unclear
concept of economics, but the reader must read my other papers to
learn economics. (If you learned economics from Samuelson, you
don't know economics.) But, I'll leave economics out of it.
Proponents of the American economic system (quasi-Capitalism)
don't seem to understand that the lives of working people have no
extrinsic purpose. People are not here to be exploited by
entrepreneurs, to designate employers as charitably as I can.
People belong to themselves. We better ask ourselves why people
who take drugs often lose all interest in their employers'
agendas. Isn't it clear that the fault lies with the work, the
workplaces, and the bosses, not with drugs! Further, the remarks
above concerning the lack of any scientific evidence continue to
apply to performance in the workplace.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Higher Taxes </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA is not clear how these higher taxes
come about. I shall argue in a moment that it is unlikely that
the higher taxes are needed to benefit drug users. I hope I have
made it abundantly clear that the purpose of a human life is not
to be of the greatest possible service to the State, which might
include paying taxes. I shall have to await a cogent argument
from the DEA (or one of its pawns) before I can say what I think
of it.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Increased Health Costs Including Increased
Insurance Premiums </h3>

<p><font size="2">Since we have no decent scientific evidence
that links workplace accidents to drug use, we shall rule out
that factor. (Certainly, the most dangerous corporate policy in
the chemical industry, with which I am familiar, is hiring
contract workers who cannot read the language in which the safety
and operating manuals are written. This has resulted in many
horrible catastrophes. Probably, chemical plants need to be much
smaller to lessen the scope of the harm done by mishaps.
Currently, plants are large enough to wipe out entire cities,
cf., Bhopal.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If we are to believe the DEA, many drug users
will not be receiving health insurance benefits due to their own
choice, but we Americans have not enacted equal opportunity
legislation to prevent unfair and unconstitutional employment
discrimination against drug users who are as competent as anyone
whether they are stoned at work or not. Drugs enhance
performance. That's why most major-league baseball players used
drugs before the country returned to the Dark Ages, cf., Jim
Bouton [15]. Also, if the DEA wants to claim that drug users have
shorter life spans, they must admit as well that they will
require health care for a shorter period. Also, many drug users
don't avail themselves of the medical establishment at all. After
all, they are into self-medication, are they not? To carry that
point further still, if people could write their own
prescriptions, medical costs and, concomitantly, the incomes of
physicians would be reduced. For my first paper on drugs [2], I
interviewed a drug user who wishes to boycott doctors. In that
paper, I make practically the complete case for complete
legalization and decontrol of all drugs. If you had read it, as
you should have, we might not need to have this discussion so
many years later as there would be nothing to discuss.
Nevertheless, I am pleased to record my latest thinking on the
subject for my own personal records. Suppose, for example, that a
person is willing to sign an affidavit that he will never avail
himself of the health-care system, except for the pharmaceutical
sector (and of course the textbook publishing and sales
business). In that case, would the DEA (or Congress) be willing
to permit him to prescribe for himself? Finally, in the unlikely
event that drugs kill a user, the death is swift, normally, and,
therefore, inexpensive!</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">The DEA's Last Word on Personal Freedom </h3>

<p><font size="2">&quot;In short, few people use the Individual
Autonomy argument any more because it is painfully obvious that
drug use affects not only the individual user, but also the
user's family, innocent third parties, and society as a
whole.&quot; We shall need many more words than this to establish
our rebuttal, but not only because the DEA expects the American
people to be incredibly stupid and, of course, they will not be
disappointed. In America, independent thought has been wiped out
by insidious propaganda techniques learned from Madison Avenue
with the full force of the academic social science establishment
in the vanguard. (How do professors shave themselves in the
morning? After only a few years, I became so ashamed of my
(academic) calling that I could not go on, even though I thought
that I needed the money.) The Sufis, an amusing little
free-thinking off-shoot of Islam, ask, &quot;Are people really as
stupid as we say they are?&quot; Absolutely, as they demonstrate
persuasively.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I first wish to comment on the gratuitous use
of the expression &quot;painfully obvious&quot;. This is simply
infuriating, as no valid evidence has been given. Not only is it
not obvious, it is not even true. In mathematics, we would call
this handwaving. It's what you do when you have forgotten the
proof or no proof exists. To use this argument to suspend
constitutional guarantees, one would have to show that this
&quot;effect&quot; occurs in every case, and that the effect is
bad, and that the drug user is somehow in the wrong to create
this effect. I wish to discuss the effect on the family first.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We may safely disregard the possibility that
the effect involves violence as we have no evidence that drug use
is responsible for violence with a non-negligible frequency of
occurrence. On the contrary, drug users are more gentle,
sensitive, and caring than the public at large. I have drawn up a
list of complaints made by the wife of a friend of mine. <i>I
shall pretend that I am he.</i> When I say &quot;my wife&quot;, I
mean &quot;his wife&quot;. I shall suppose that my children would
not come up with complaints substantially different from these. I
distinguish between imaginary offenses, such that the
&quot;victim&quot; would not be inconvenienced if her attitude
were at least different if not more correct, and actual offenses,
such that the state of mind of the victim has no bearing on the
&quot;abuse&quot; she must suffer. I have used the analogy of the
mother whose son is homosexual, in which her suffering depends
entirely on <i>her</i> state of mind and has nothing to do with
his behavior.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">My Wife's Concerns </h3>

<p><font size="2"><b>1. Fear for my health.</b> Not really valid
as she refuses to respect my dietary needs, which have an
immediate and permanent effect on my health.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>2. She objects to what she perceives as
unattractive and bizarre behavior manifested when I'm stoned and
which she finds embarrassing.</b> Sounds pretty subjective to me.
When I get stoned, I become preoccupied with art, literature,
mathematics, and, music. I look distracted, particularly when I
am interrupted. I am at work and, therefore, my long and enduring
faithful devotion to my wife, although always strong and
sustaining, is, perforce, in the background. Interruptions,
therefore, cause me confusion, which might be mistaken for idiocy
by a person who has never experienced an obsession. I have no
idea what I look like, but it probably bears comparison to the
crazy artist or mad scientist stereotyped unfavorably in our
commercial movies. Of course, even geniuses don't get the respect
due them from their wives - or their valets. How can that fat
slob who belches at the dinner table be in a class with Einstein
or Beethoven? I wonder what Bach's wife called him when the
children weren't around, which, come to think of it, must have
been infrequently in his case.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Mrs. Bach - &quot;Hey, [ironically] maestro,
you left the lid up on the toilet seat again. Honestly, I don't
know why I married you; you can't do one single thing right. Mrs.
Handel's husband just bought her a new dish washer, but what do I
get from you - another grosse fugue, you bum.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Bach - &quot;Yes, dear, you're perfectly right,
dear, I'm listening to every word you say, dear; I'll get to it
the first thing in the morning; but, if you'll give me half a
sec, I'll put the finishing touches on this cantata and <i>then</i>
take out the garbage. [sotto voce] What the hell is she talking
about now? Goddam alto clef, let's see - F-A-C-E-G. [loudly] Yes,
dear, right away, dear. [sotto voce] No respect! And I think
she's pregnant again. That little bastard Carl [his son, Carl
Philipp Emanuel Bach] ate all my morphine suppositories, again.
Why me! [loudly] No, dear, you do <i>not</i> smell pot.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>3. Maybe taking drugs is immoral.</b> Well,
that's what the DEA, other authoritarians, and the liquor and
cigarette lobby are spending a fortune to induce her to think,
but I don't think she's that stupid. No, that's not a problem for
us. In any case, I've gone to a lot of trouble to show that
taking drugs is not immoral [5]. What is immoral is trying to
stop someone from taking drugs! My wife would not be in a
position to criticize my morals as she puts meat products on my
plate, rarely but sometimes, even though I have expressed my
moral outrage at the killing of animals for food, not to mention
the horrible treatment of many animals prior to slaughter, cf.,
large chicken &quot;plants&quot;. Eating meat really is immoral,
however I have not forcibly prevented anyone from doing it nor
have I exacted punishment from those who do. If this drug war
continues, that will undoubtedly change, although not because of
any direct action on my part.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>4. What will the neighbors, her parents, her
employers, and co-workers think?</b> Well, that's the same
problem as above, <i>but why should she care what people think!</i></font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>5. Danger from the police.</b> Well, yes,
that's what we're trying to fix.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>6. Danger in the Third Ward, a Black ghetto.</b>
Ditto.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>7. I earn less money when I take drugs.</b>
I don't earn any money in any case. But, to tell the truth, I
usually don't take drugs when I am employed. It's really too
complicated and, since I can take them or leave them according to
my inclinations and the circumstances, I choose not to take them
when engaged in certain activities, but I have never said I would
not ever take them again. I have never repudiated drugs. That
would be dreadful.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>8. I am less productive on drugs.</b>
Absolutely and categorically false. While, it is true that I
don't design chemical plants on drugs, I could if I wanted to,
provided I worked at home, the way things are nowadays, which we
are trying to fix. I don't watch professional football or junk
movies when I'm using drugs, but I get more done by orders of
magnitude and my work is far superior to anything I can do
without drugs. That includes mathematics, any type of problem
solving, philosophy (old-fashioned &quot;big philosophy&quot; -
original philosophy, music theory and practice, craftsmanship,
housework and home repairs, writing, study, financial
transactions (yes, I do financial transactions, just like
ordinary folks and I <i>do</i> live in the world), driving a car
(long-distance travel), photography, graphic arts (modeling), and
sex (if sex may be called work). I'm sure I've forgotten a few
things. But, basically, I can do anything on drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>9. I don't eat well when I'm stoned.</b> Oh,
that it were true! I gained four pounds over a two-day period the
last time I got high. Heroin improves my appetite tremendously
and cocaine does not attenuate it. Sometimes I may get absorbed
in my work and skip lunch, but I always sit down with my wife for
the (obligatory) family evening meal. I may eat differently as I
am trying very hard to avoid meat. My wife cannot seem to
understand that I object to killing animals for food on moral
grounds.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>10. She likes to have things her way, which
includes me.</b> I have been subjected to a remodeling agenda
from the beginning; and, believe it or not, I <i>have</i> changed
considerably to accommodate my wife's design. I think many women
commit to men under the assumption that, although men are not
satisfactory as they are found in nature, it won't take long to
change them into whatever the women want! I believe this is a
proverb.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>11. She likes me better when I'm not high.</b>
This is a matter of taste and tolerance for what does not
correspond to what we would wish for. I was high when she met me
and it was some time before she saw me when I was not high. If I
didn't suit her tastes, that was the time to do something about
it, However, in those days I did not object to sacred pledges and
we pledged ourselves to each other without any conditions.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>12. Drugs are too expensive.</b> Amen. I
could synthesize or grow any drug I need to take. I do not
believe taking legalized drugs would be a financial burden,
especially if I could make some for my friends.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>13. I could lose the car if I am arrested
for drugs while I'm using it.</b> This is unfair,
unconstitutional (due process violation), and must be changed.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>14. When I take drugs, our family is not
like the TV family we are indoctrinated to want to emulate,
presumably, to support the environmentally catastrophic consumer
culture. </b>Thank God for drugs, because, if I did not take
drugs, there, but for the grace of God, go we.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>15. When I am high on drugs, I frequently
get wrapped up in my arts, viz., music and literature.</b> At
last, we come to what I believe is the real reason my wife
doesn't want me to take drugs. Music and literature take me away
from her, at least temporarily. Women fear these rivals more than
they fear other women. As Duke Ellington put it musically,
&quot;A drum is a woman.&quot; W. Somerset Maugham claims that
women hate art [16]. Mark Hecker, the guitarist and graphic
artist, once quipped, &quot;I have never been in a situation
where music was being played, women were present, and they did
not do everything in their power to destroy (stop) the
music.&quot; I think we have arrived at the sad and unfortunate
truth. Thus, it is the drug taker whose freedom is being
abrogated by his wife. This is classic. And, as usual, the
authoritarians (read Conservatives if you wish) turn the truth
into its opposite. This book by the DEA is a handbook of lies.
[It's worse than the Bible, which I always thought was the
epitome of falsehood. Moses spoke to God. Oh, sure.]</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Nine: Legal Issues Surrounding the
Legalization of Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">The DEA points are easy to answer. Use the
Fletcher Doctrine described earlier. Remember that we insist that
people may not be punished for doing harm until they actually do
harm. This does not remove the element of prevention, which
remains education - not propaganda but education. Read the
definition of &quot;education&quot; in a good dictionary such as
the Random House [6]. Condemn Dram Shop Laws. The function of the
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is to advise not control.
Thus, hopelessly ill people could try anything with a full
knowledge of the risks. The DEA does not present difficult
problems in this chapter.</font> </p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Ten: Environmental Issues and the
Legalization of Drugs </h3>

<p><font size="2">I do not use this argument. Nevertheless, as an
exercise, the reader may look for errors in the DEA logic.</font>
</p>

<h3 align="center">Chapter Eleven: &quot;Anything Is Better Than
What We Are Doing Now&quot; Hopelessness, Drug Control, and
Potential Solution </h3>

<p><font size="2">Again, I do not use this argument. Be careful
here, though, because, if the purpose of the DEA is to demonize
drugs, drug users, and drug dealers, they are very successful. Of
course, they can never stop the flow of drugs, but they may not
claim that that is their objective. They are making it plenty
tough for many users, which, of course, we view as immoral,
wicked, and, indeed, illegal. Threaten them with class-action
libel if you wish. If they think about it, they may be worried.
David Robinson in his sneaker ad was definitely guilty of libel
and would have lost in a fair trial. Nowadays, one never knows
who the jury may be and any verdict is possible! This is an
important point and the tyranny better start worrying about it. I
conclude with my seven-point post-prohibition plan. Obviously, my
major thrust was the constitutional and moral issue, which they
have said nobody uses anymore! That's only the <i>main</i> issue.
Next comes terrorism and selective assassinations if the tyranny
persists. That Pablo Escabar sure knew how to treat authoritarian
public officials. Well, we have to get their attention. Of
course, we do not condone violence and we will repeat that as
often as necessary. Any allusions to violence are in the nature
of humor or, at their most drastic, represent dire predictions of
events we would do anything to prevent. Insist on this. We never
discuss anything more drastic than an occasional dirty trick that
we would never play on anyone. We only mention these tactics to
express our good-natured joviality, as we are the last people on
earth who will lose their sense of humor.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">My Seven-Point Plan for Post Prohibition </h1>

<p><font size="2">My new plan for post-prohibition society
consists of the following: (1) an equal-rights amendment for drug
users, (2) teaching people how to live with drugs, to choose them
wisely, and to use them properly (to get the most out of them and
to prevent accidents, disease, and unpleasant side-effects), (3)
new opportunities for drug users, heteroclites, and other people
who are &quot;different&quot; to make contributions to society in
appropriate nonstandard settings including settings where one can
work while using drugs, (4) during the transition, reparations
for victims of the laws against drugs amounting to whatever they
need to live abundantly, and (5) free informal counseling for
troubled or troublesome drug users <i>by</i> drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Since, it must be admitted, some people who are
taking drugs might like to stop - even in a normalized society, I
propose two additional &quot;points&quot;: (6) institutions like
commercial hotels that cost no more than hotels and that have all
the amenities of hotels and more, e.g., VCRs and videotape
libraries and books, except that the (voluntary) guest may not
leave for a fixed period of time agreed upon in advance (by the
guest) nor indulge in certain drugs beyond agreed upon limits,
which might be monotonically decreasing. Rural locations might
provide better settings with lower real estate costs offset by
higher transportation costs. Only one &quot;medical&quot;
&quot;professional&quot; per shift would be needed, namely, to
dispense medicine. I can say truthfully that I would trust any
drug dealer I have known to perform that job - except for one,
who was generous to a fault. Vouchers could be provided for those
who can't pay. And, finally, (7) new drugs that prevent
withdrawal symptoms and cravings may be used (voluntarily), if
they exist. Such claims have been made lately for the drug
ibogaine (17), but, unless the costs are reduced or borne by the
state, it will not be widely used. Also, the claims may not be
true - or not true in an acceptable mode; i.e., the effectiveness
of ibogaine may depend on &quot;religious&quot; faith, which
might diminish the humanity of the patient. Moreover, those who
have been &quot;cured&quot; by ibogaine may have merely
transferred their allegiance to a new drug, which, in the case of
ibogaine, is long lasting (six months or longer) - at first, but
which, after repeated doses, might &quot;need&quot; to be used
more frequently. Lately, similar effects have been ascribed to
the South American drug yage or one of its derivatives. Actually,
the possibility of switching to a new drug is included under
points (2) and (5) above.</font> </p>

<h1 align="center">Appendix A. Letter to William Buckley After He
Lost Debate to Charles Rangel </h1>

<p><font size="2">March 28, 1990</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">William Buckley</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Firing Line&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">P. O. Box 5966</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Columbia, SC 29250</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Dear Mr. Buckley,</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I suspect that many great and famous men do not
get to see the mail addressed to them. In case this is being read
by someone who is considering not letting Mr. Buckley see it, let
me caution against that idea. Whether I receive a reply or not, I
will assume that Mr. Buckley is aware of the arguments expressed
in this letter and in the enclosed paper, &quot;The Case for Drug
Legalization and Decontrol in the United States.&quot; Any future
deeds or words by Mr. Buckley in connection with this debate will
be construed in the light of this. Whereas it would be an
injustice to Mr. Buckley to assume that he had ignored convincing
arguments if his staff had not permitted him to see them, the
blame would reside with his staff. I wish I knew how to say that
better in fewer words, then I could begin all letters to the high
and mighty with a stock paragraph - like the warning on a package
of cigarettes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">That said, I would like to comment on the
special edition of &quot;Firing Line&quot; with the debate on
drug legalization, although I tuned in a little late and had to
turn it off 15 minutes early to go to bed. It seems that none of
the pro-legal team could answer Rangel's point that we should try
prevention and treatment before legalization. Also, his
observation that we have not addressed the social causes of
improper drug use, e.g., poverty, was detrimental to the
pro-legal side. So, when I tuned out, the prohibitionists had won
the debate.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pro-legal side deserved to lose because
they did not produce the most important arguments for
legalization, the points covered in my paper, the addendum, and
my letters to the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which might make
sense to someone who had read the DPF Newsletter (in particular,
one of them destroys Judge Sweet's position). Since I covered
basically everything, let me single out the crucial points,
namely, those that destroy Rangel's position. Also, before I
forget, why in the world wasn't the anti-prohibition side
adequately represented? Didn't you consult Arnold Trebach? If you
did, why didn't Arnold get someone who supports the following
points (not me, I can't appear on television; however, I am
willing to debate anyone, anytime, anywhere in the print media,
including you):</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. The laws against drugs are unconstitutional
on the basis of (i) the First Amendment (the laws are essentially
of a religious nature), (ii) the Ninth Amendment (proceeding from
rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness), and (iii)
violation of due process (&quot;abuse&quot; is undefined, as
pointed out by Dr. Robert Goodman).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Prevention and treatment are based on
fallacies and unstated assumptions, namely, (i) drugs are bad for
everyone, (ii) drug abuse is a disease, not is <i>like</i> a
disease but <i>is</i> a disease, to name only two.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. Prevention and treatment won't work, mainly
for the reasons stated in (2). You continued to emphasize that
prevention and treatment won't get the criminals out of the drug
trade, which is one of your main concerns, and certainly a valid
concern, but the thrust of the argument fails because no one
could prove that Rangel's plan wouldn't dry up the demand.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">I am interested in obtaining a transcript of
the debate; but, by the time you have read this, I will have
spoken to &quot;Firing Line&quot; and obtained my copy if it is
at all possible. I am preparing another paper for the DPF. (Part
of the enclosed paper is in <i>Drug Policy 1989-1990, A
Reformer's Catalogue</i>, Chapter 6 [1].) The new paper is to be
entitled &quot;Unstated Assumptions and Fallacies in Prevention
and Treatment.&quot; [2] Perhaps you would like a copy?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sincerely,</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thomas L. Wayburn</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Note to the reader (4-30-96): Buckley did not
request a copy of Reference 2; however, he did read Reference 1,
at least as much of it &quot;as he had time for&quot;. He
accepted my position in that paper but without excessive
enthusiasm. Nowadays, one no longer expects famous men and women
who dabble in essay writing to exclaim, &quot;My Heavens, this is
the greatest essay I have ever read, at least the best I have
read lately. Why is this writer not recognized? I shall do
whatever I can to bring this great talent to the attention of the
reading public.&quot; I don't believe anyone (save myself alone)
would do that even for his own son. Hey, it's a jungle out there.</font>

<p>APPENDIX C. THE LAWS AGAINST DRUGS AND THE WAR ON DRUGS RATHER
THAN THE USE OF DRUGS PER SE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST (ALMOST
ALL) DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS. Classification of Deaths
Involving Drugs We may place deaths associated with drugs in
categories, which should be nearly exhaustive. If someone takes
exception to the proposition that forms the title of this section
and names a category not on my list, I am prepared to deal with
that category at any time the detractor wishes. (I am prepared to
defend my viewpoint against all comers at any time and any place
provided the debate be fair; e.g., I must be allowed as much time
as I need to make my points or my rebuttals to my opponents
points regardless of the exigencies of television or other
broadcast medium. Nothing could be more outrageous than placing
time limits on a debate of this importance. I don't care if
regular programming has to be suspended for a year. The airwaves
are a public trust and must serve the needs of the people and the
people desperately need rational debate on public issues.] The

<p>ACCIDENTS OCCURRING DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF DRUGS These are
rare and, in any case, are of much smaller scope, than accidents
occurring in the commercial pharmaceutical business. Thus,
legality might increase the number of such deaths, but in the
same way that the manufacture of a cure for cancer would. We
would not be against a cure for cancer just because, in the
normal course of operations, accidents do occur wherever
chemicals are present. MURDERS PERPETRATED BY DEBTORS AND
CREDITORS IN THE DRUG TRADE The murder of a creditor to avoid
payment with a child caught in the crossfire On December 12,
1995, an article about a three-year old child who was killed in
the crossfire associated with the an unpayable drug debt appeared
in The Houston Chronicle. Undoubtedly, the intention of the
article was to demonize drug users and sellers further; but the
fact is that, due to the illegality of drugs, creditors and
debtors do not have access to the normal legal procedures
associated with debt. Thus, the laws against drugs are the
culprit. Sellers of legal drugs do not in general extend credit.
When drugs are legal no premium is added to compensate the dealer
for additional risk. Further, in the case of the most popular
illegal drugs research costs are virtually nonexistence because
of thousands of years of experience available at no cost to
anyone. Thus, manufacturers do not have to add a premium to
recoup the cost of research as must be done in the case of
Zantac, for example. The low price justifies drug stores in
refusing to extend credit for a bottle of aspirins, say.
Therefore, it is the laws against drugs that allow debt and
credit with its concomitant disputation into the picture.
Creditors in legal trades have recourse to the courts - whatever
that's worth. Whereas, it must be admitted that the civil courts
are not a realistic remedy for most people who are involved in
business disputes, including the great number that arise due to
debt, such recourse as they do afford is a slight deterrent to
violence. We all know that a broken knee cap is a much more
effective expedient in the case where one feels he has been
unjustly treated or, if one retains bourgeois values, a punch in
the nose. Debtors in legal trade have recourse to bankruptcy and,

<p>, are rarely murdered by their creditors who have much too
much at stake to risk everything to recover a single debt. It is
but a poor business indeed, whose solvency depends on the
performance of a single account, although, to be sure, such
single-client businesses do exist and, undoubtedly a ruined
tradesman has from time to time dispatched the perceived cause of
his ruin in a fit of pique - if that is not too mild a word. In
the normal case &quot;legitimate&quot; businessmen do not conduct
their affairs in the presence of children, upon whom they wish to
impose the delusion that not all decency in the world has been
dispensed with in the life-and-death struggle for wealth and
power exemplified by our ever and abiding mercantile economy.
'Nuff said. MURDERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BATTLE FOR MARKET SHARE
As a Common Feature in the Conduct of All Business I believe the
battles for market share among the robber barons are sufficiently
well documented that no one need doubt that, if you did not sell
your upstart gas station to Standard Oil at the price they
suggested, it would be blown sky high regardless of who got hurt.
In the &quot;old&quot; days, i.e., the days of John D.
Rockefeller, who has living great-grandchildren if not living
grandchildren, the establishment got established by playing
hardball - no less hard than the drive-by shootings in the
'hood'. If these were the old days, we might not expect to see
the violence surrounding the drug trade go down just because drug
traffickers were made &quot;legit&quot; by virtue of legislative
fiat. But, these are not the &quot;old days&quot;. As a Vanishing
Tradition Displaced by Still More Insidious Methods That Happily
Visit Most of the Concomitant Misery Upon People Who Are of No
Account, i.e., Not &quot;Our&quot; Type of People The above title
is an example of irony in its most bitter form. The very
&quot;highest&quot; class of people in our country, the real
plutocracy, do not in general tolerate competition from
&quot;upstarts&quot;. If a large drug company were manufacturing
cocaine for the mass market and I should attempt to enter the
market by selling a purer, cleaner product by mail-order through
my web site on the internet at no profit but at a lower cost than
the big company, the big company would turn its lawyers on me
like a pack of killer dogs. They might try to get me on
&quot;look-alike&quot; charges; they might try to dig up
something in my past that could be used against me; they might
try to get me kicked off the internet; and I can't imagine what
else they might do; but, and this is most important, they
probably would not have me murdered like they used to do in the
old days. Thus, violence associated with the struggle for market
share would take a different form from the violence in the
neighborhoods between rival street gangs who wish to sell
&quot;crack&quot; in a city park. Marketing in general and
Advertising in Particular It is probably safe to say that all
marketers practice fraud to some extent and that every
advertisement at the mass market level (not a child advertising
for homes for some of his cat's kittens) is deceptive if it is
not in such incredibly bad taste that young children raised on
television can no longer tell the difference between fine art and
meaningless garbage. Conspiracies and Monopolies In a normalized,
legal drug market, the people must take precautions against
conspiracies of all types, including total monopolies. But, drug
production is not such an arcane art that people cannot manage to
carry it forward in their garages and basements even if they are
producing effectively for themselves alone. The danger of
industrial monopolies is a political problem or, as the Unabomber
would put it, an industrial problem. Frankly, I don't see the
difference. People who get stoned are guaranteed to make better
political decisions than those who don't, which is yet another
point for legalization, which should reduce the violence normally
associated with the formation and destruction of conspiracies and
monopolies. OVERDOSES, SUBSTITUTED CHEMICALS, IMPURITIES, AND
UNEXPECTED EFFECTS We must demand high-quality drugs, carefully
and truthfully labeled. This can be done, in the beginning by a
government bureau; but, as the profit motive disappears,
government regulation will gradually become unnecessary, as who
would perpetrate evil for no advantage to himself when the
rewards of virtue for its own sake are right before his eyes.
Thus, most of the deaths caused by drugs will be eliminated by
avoiding (i) overdoses that occur because the user is used to
weak dope and accidentally gets some that has not been cut very
much - either intentionally or by accident, (ii) drugs containing
harmful impurities (information on how to produce high-quality
drugs will be widely disseminated without government
interference), and (iii) drugs will not be mislabeled - neither
intentionally to defraud the consumer nor accidentally through
carelessness and/or ignorance. These are the most important ways
in which the laws against drugs kill. CRIMES OF PASSION OF WHICH
PEOPLE WHO DON'T TAKE DRUGS ARE INCAPABLE For Those Who Believe
Such Crimes Exist If a person takes a drug that enables him to
experience deep passion of which he is not capable otherwise, he
is nowise more culpable than a naturally deeply passionate person
who exhibits the same behavior. The test of whether his behavior
qualifies as passion is the observation of the person on the
identical dosage of the identical drug but not exhibiting the
passion. If such a time comes, we know that the passion was not
caused by the drug but, rather, was triggered by an insult, a
sexual provocation, or some other external stimulus. The drug,
then, merely permits an inhibited person to experience the depth
of feeling that is his due as a sentient being and a child of God
- a feeling that is experienced normally under the same
circumstances by a natural person. The tragedy of a sick society
that kills natural impulses in men and women is not something for
which a person may be punished if he merely discards the binding
neurosis by means of a conscious shock. The man who is capable of
deep feeling and correspondingly violent action is healthier than
the man who is incapable of feeling deeply and takes no steps to
free himself from the shackles imposed by an insane society. This
analysis can be applied to nearly every form of violent crime.
The criminal bears less guilt than all but the most spiritual of
souls - actually the truly enlightened who can transcend the
world completely and must be a rare species indeed. But, the
enlightenment of the spiritual sage is no substitute for the
political change needed to make society rational and just, such
that people who are truly alive needn't be bound and gagged like
animals by the oppressors and their willing dupes, who, of
course, are victims as well. Conservatives will recognize this as
the typical liberal notion that society is at fault for the
behavior of criminals. It is stated here without reservations,
qualification, or, needless to say, apologies of any kind. It is
the plain truth and easy to prove, as I have done in Chapter 4 of
Reference 1, my large work in progress, of which the first part,
which includes Chapter 4, is available from the American Policy
Institute, Inc. The Myth of Reefer Madness and its Contemporary
Counterparts As stated in my rebuttal of the DEA argument,
drug-induced crime is largely a myth. The DEA has no case here.
The constitutional rights of (otherwise) law abiding citizens may
not be denied due to the behavior of a few exceptional people who
would probably commit crimes with or without drugs. No
scientifically verified mechanistic link has been established
between taking drugs and committing crimes. No such link may be
as sumed until a valid scientific experiment proves its
existence. No such experiment has been performed. Always drugs
are placed in a singularly disadvantageous position, thus
ensuring the results desired by the biased pseudo-scientists. (A
true scientist must be absolutely fair if not completely
disinterested. It is practically impossible to find a
disinterested scientist and, if he could be found, who would fund
his research?) The above is merely a repetition of more complete
statements made earlier. DEATHS DUE TO PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT
Mythical Impairment Prohibitionists are fond of citing studies
that demonstrate how inept we become when we take drugs. These
studies are normally conducted by people whose funding comes from
those with a vested interest in positive results, i.e., showing
that impairment does indeed exist. By definition, these are not
scientific studies as scientific studies are performed by
disinterested people who are just as willing to be proved wrong
as right, nay, more willing - as the falsification of a
scientific hypothesis is more likely to lead to new and
interesting results than a corroboration, e.g., Michelson-Morley.
In a sense, every experiment is designed to prove a hypothesis
false. But, those who accept funding from &quot;interested&quot;
parties are already tainted and we should discount their findings
one hundred percent. (Personally, I advocate spitting in their
faces and cutting them dead in public - &quot;cutting&quot;, that
is, in the old-fashioned sense of high-class snobbery. Normally,
I am as egalitarian as the next chap; but, in the case of those
who drag our noblest institutions in the mud, I am willing to
make an exception - with the greatest of regrets, of course.) Let
me give an example (from the main text) provided by the Drug
Enforcement Agency: The last statement in the (DEA) paragraph
under consideration is just plain ludicrous on the face of it.
That's why we know these drug warriors are plain old-fashioned
liars - desperately trying to hold on to their lucrative (very
lucrative, I opine) jobs that are not and never were needed. Can
you say parasite? Here's the statement: &quot;Furthermore, a
study conducted by Stanford University found that twenty-four
hours after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a
plane.&quot; The reference is the Drug Awareness Information
Newsletter, undoubtedly another bunch of liars, but certainly not
a reviewed scientific journal. Now, after making a sensational
claim like this, why wouldn't they give us a reference to the
actual study? Twenty-four hours after smoking a joint, hardly
anyone can distinguish a difference from the way he felt before
he smoked the joint. Given this indisputable everyday fact, why
should we ever get in a plane knowing that the pilot is unable to
discern by feelings alone whether he is capable of landing it?
How did they get permission to carry out this test legally? Who
would carry it out illegally? I know the president of Stanford
might divert research funds to luxuries for his personal use, but
illegally fly planes ... ? Genuine Impairment Of all the drugs,
that which impairs physical and mental faculties to the maximum
extent possible is, of course, alcohol, which is not under
discussion. Average doses of a few drugs can really get the
subject whacked - notably Quaaludes, PCP, and most barbiturates
under fairly common circumstances if the subject be not confined
to bed. In the very first place, suppose that the menu of
available drugs contain the entire pharmacopoeia. My claim is
that the vast majority of users of these drugs will choose other
drugs. (I can't imagine anyone choosing phenobarbital when heroin
is available; heroin does not cause impairment in the great
preponderance of cases - quite the contrary.) For the very few
who do not choose better drugs, I give you the Fletcher Doctrine,
which belongs to legal philosophy. The Fletcher Doctrine states
that, while the person who does the damage due to lack of
self-possession under these drugs is not responsible for his
actions, the person who decided to use those drugs of impairment
is responsible for what his other self may have done. Is that
clear? Responsibility is properly assigned; no one gets away with
anything; and, in all probability, no more harm is done than in a
society in which the only legal drug of impairment is alcohol.
This should be an extremely rare class of unfortunate incidents
with which we shall have to contend as best we can. It is nothing
new and I don't think we may punish the user of a drug of
impairment until he causes damage - in keeping with Fletcher.
(Don't look now, but all those people who drove cars while they
were drunk and did not do any harm have been improperly contemned
- according to this entirely reasonable view.) Conclusion We have
shown that in nearly all cases death would not have occurred if
drugs were legal and freely available to everyone, provided, of
course, that they are of high quality and properly labeled as to
strength, recommended dosage, and with all information necessary
to the user correctly supplied. We have many deaths attributed to
alcohol, which is legal, but we claim that alcohol is a very bad
drug that no reasonable person ought to prefer when a wide
variety of alternative drugs is available. The same comment
applies to many other inferior drugs and may even apply to crack
cocaine. Thus, deaths due to drugs should be rare in a
normalized, post-legalization society. We are left with an odd
case or two where the Fletcher Doctrine must be applied, but we
have satisfied our promise to prove the statement in the title;
namely, the laws against drugs and the war on drugs rather than
the use of drugs per se are responsible for most (almost all)
deaths associated with drugs. Finally, although it is easy to
design a fair scientific experiment to test all of these
observations, such an experiment cannot be performed until drugs
are legal and normal and all of the stigma of drug taking has
disappeared, at which time we shall have achieved our objective
and the drug problem will be just another shameful chapter in
human history. Reference 1. Wayburn, Thomas L, On the
