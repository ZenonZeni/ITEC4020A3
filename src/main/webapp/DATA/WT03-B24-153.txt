Lotus-Security - Lotus Announces Compromise for Export of Strong
Encryption
<p>
By ELIZABETH WEISE
AP Cyberspace Writer
<p>
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Lotus Development Corp. announced a
compromise with the federal government Wednesday that will allow it
to put better security features into the international version of
its Notes program.
<p>
While the arrangement assures the government it can access data
under extreme circumstances, it represents an advance in the
strength of security allowed in software exported from the United
States.
<p>
Federal law prohibits the export of certain high-level
encryption programs, which are defined as a munition under a Cold
War-era arms control act.
<p>
Encryption programs take ordinary data and put it in secret form
that cannot be accessed without the proper data ``key.'' The
government's arbitrary standard for cracking encryption programs
when needed is at a technical level described as ``40-bit.''
<p>
Some software programs sold in the United States, including
Lotus Notes, now use stronger 64-bit encryption. Lotus has been
under pressure to bring such security to Notes users overseas.
<p>
Although 40-bit encryption is quite strong, highly-sophisticated
attacks using several computers have been able to break it
recently.
<p>
``Our customers have basically lost confidence in 40-bit
cryptography,'' said Ray Ozzie, president of Iris Associates, the
unit of Lotus that developed Notes.
<p>
``That left us in a bind. We are the vendor that's supposedly
selling a secure system to them and they are saying it's no good,''
Ozzie told a standing room audience at the RSA Data Security
conference.
<p>
Changes in the general export laws seemed unlikely so Lotus
negotiated an interim solution.
<p>
The export version of Lotus Notes 4.0, which went on sale last
week, includes 64-bit encryption but the company has given the U.S.
government a special code that unlocks the final 24 bits.
<p>
For companies that use the international version of Notes, it's
as if Lotus put two strong locks on a door and gave a key for one
to the U.S. government. Thieves have to get break through two
locks, the government only one.
<p>
``This protects corporate information from malicious crackers
but permits the government to retain their current access,'' Ozzie
said. He acknowledged the solution was only a compromise and said
Lotus wants to see better data security methods developed
worldwide.
<p>
However, many participants at the conference saw the move as a
cosmetic answer to the tension between corporate desires for the
best security and government's interest to access data when
necessary.
<p>
``It's a useful stopgap measure that has no value in the long
run,'' said Donn Parker, a senior security consultant with SRI
International, a computer research company in Menlo Park, Calif.
<p>
Simson Garfinkel, author and computer security expert, said he's
not sure international buyers of Notes will like the solution.
<p>
``Foreign companies don't want the U.S. government to spy on
their data any more than the U.S. government wants foreign
companies to be able to spy on theirs,'' Garfinkel said.
<p>
International Business Machines Corp. bought Lotus in July,
citing the success of Notes, a sophisticated communications and
database program.
