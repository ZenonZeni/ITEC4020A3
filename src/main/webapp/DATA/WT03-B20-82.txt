<A Name = "1.0"></A><H1>1. INTRODUCTION </H1>
Demand Side Management (DSM) is one of the most cost-effective
resources available to utilities today. DSM represents an important
policy choice for avoiding adverse impacts on health, environment,
and public amenity that result from the production of electrical
power -- impacts that include the societal costs of energy use
associated with the entire fuel cycle, not simply the impacts
at the point of generation. Furthermore, energy efficiency programs
targeted to low-income customers can provide important societal
benefits beyond those related to the customer's energy consumption.
DSM can also have a beneficial impact upon direct utility costs
through decreasing arrears and by decreasing exposure to risks
of future environmental regulation. Other social benefits associated
with job creation, government subsidies, oil import costs, and
depletion of natural resources are also important.
<P>
This report aims to comprehensively identify, and quantify where
appropriate, the societal benefits associated with DSM programs
in New England. <SUP><A HREF = "#FN1">1</A></SUP> Among the issues that are explored
in this report are societal benefits of avoided generation, effects
on local economies, hidden costs of fossil fuel dependence, effects
on low-income customers, and additional benefits of DSM programs.
The range of sources examined includes published documents from
academic institutions, state and federal government, utility planning
studies, a variety of unpublished information (e.g., utility RFP
protocols, testimony, commission orders) and personal communications.
Wherever possible, New England-specific data is used.<P>
<A Name = "1.1"></A><H2>1.1 Competitive Forces in the Electric Industry</H2>
<P>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 brought about increased <I>wholesale
competition </I>where electric utilities have been able to choose
between purchases from Qualifying Facilities (QFs), Independent
Power Producers (IPPs), cogenerators, other utilities selling
bulk power, and from Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs). Utilities
could face increased <I>retail</I> <I>competition</I> as well,
whereby consumers (e.g., an industrial facility) or groups of
consumers could contract with whatever suppliers they wish, including
utilities outside the conventional service territory and/or IPPs.
<P>
Increasing competition in the electric industry will require a
rethinking of the means to achieve energy and environmental objectives.
Some of the results presented in this report are directly affected
by the profound changes affecting the electric industry. Initiatives
by state legislatures in New England, notably Rhode Island and
New Hampshire, have succeeded in expanding the agenda from wholesale
competition, which currently exists in limited form, to the possibility
of retail competition where all classes of customers could negotiate
generation contracts. For example, in Massachusetts, the Department
of Public Utilities has opened its own investigation into electric
industry restructuring, stating its intention to &quot;... take
steps to allow a greater reliance on competition and customer
choice for retail customers in order to increase efficiency and
reduce costs, while still providing safe, reliable and least-cost
service.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN2">2</A></SUP> 
<P>
These changes emphasize the need for New England utilities to
place an even greater emphasis on obtaining the right the mix
of resources to meet customer demand. Examining the societal benefits
associated with DSM programs is a means of addressing, not only
the risk of future regulations, but the uncertainty associated
with restructuring the electric industry. The results of our analysis
suggest that the non-price benefits of DSM currently unaccounted
for in the planning process can be quite large.
<P>
While many of the restructuring proposal substitute reliance on
markets for regulation claim they will secure significant economic
benefits for customers, fundamental concerns have emerged that
certain elements of these reform proposals could discourage continued
investments in DSM programs and detract from the environmental
protection gains achieved in recent years. 
<P>
If retail competition were implemented, it could significantly
affect the level of New England DSM programs and their impacts.
Retail competition in New England could fundamentally alter planning
processes, by (a) introducing significant uncertainty into the
short- and long-term planning, (b) altering utilities' priorities
and objectives, (c) possibly undermining opportunities for cost-effective
DSM as a result of uncertainty and competitive pressures, and
(d) limiting consideration of environmental and social externalities.
It will be important to find ways to ensure that the economic
and environmental goals of IRP, and the progress that has already
been made thus far, are preserved in new protocols and conditions
affecting planning.
<P>
A range of mechanisms are available that could be used to encourage
continued investments in DSM in a restructured industry, and thereby
take into account DSM's non-price factors to some degree. These
range from market-based approaches such as emission trading schemes
and Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR), to command and control
options such as additional environmental standards and regulations,
emission caps, pollution taxes, efficiency credits, and DSM resource
portfolio requirement. There may also be various combinations
of mechanisms. At a minimum, a systems benefits charge should
be established to allow utilities assurance for recovering the
costs of their DSM programs, and minimize the risks associated
with competition.<P>
<A Name = "1.2"></A><H2>1.2 Trends in Environmental Regulation</H2>
<P>
Over the years, an extensive array of state and federal regulation
has been enacted that deal with air and water pollution, solid
waste disposal, and nuclear power operation. These range from
specific control technologies to the enforcement of emission standards
and requirements for accident prevention. Generally, federal environmental
legislation does not preempt states from enforcing their own standards
for advancing environmental quality.
<P>
No matter how the electric industry is restructured, additional
environmental standards and regulations are expected to keep pace
with developments in toxicological and environmental research.
While regulations aim to proscribe action deemed to have unacceptably
high damages to the environmental or human health, they frequently
lag behind either confirmation of the particular adverse effects
or significant exposure to the pollutant. This raises the distinct
possibility that today's allowable residual emissions from power
generation may be challenged in the future as advances in medical
knowledge about dose-response functions and sensitive populations
develops. Utility planning must find a way to take account of
the risks of future environmental regulations while awaiting their
outcome.
<P>
The impact of future environmental regulation may take a variety
of forms. Additional restrictions of a given power plant may reduce
its level of operation or require investment in additional control
equipment. A tax on carbon dioxide emissions would affect the
cost of production from all fossil plants.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN3">3</A></SUP> In addition,
since resource decisions are always made in the context of an
utility system with a mix of resources, these uncertainties need
to be considered not only for a single resource option being evaluated,
but in a system-wide context for existing and alternative future
resource options. 
<P>
The exact nature of these impacts is hard to predict, but the
facilities most likely to be affected are those burning fossil
fuels. For example, the Clinton Administration's <I>Climate Change
Action Plan</I> has established specific goals affecting carbon
dioxide emissions, and has recognized the need to go much further
than the current voluntary program to contribute to climate stabilization
over the longer term. Also, pursuant to Title III of the 1990
Clean Air Act Amendments, the USEPA has initiated a study to examine
the health risks of air toxics emitted from fossil power plants
- the results of which could lead to costly emission control equipment.<SUP>
<A HREF = "#FN4">4</A></SUP>
<P>
In Massachusetts, for example, the importance of accounting for
the risk of future regulation has been emphasized by a recent
court decision on the use of externalities in electric resource
planning. Even while striking down the DPU rule that required
utilities to apply environmental adders to bids from new power
plants in resource solicitations, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court (SJC) ruled that the DPU has the right to order a utility
to avoid a resource that may be subject to expensive emissions
restrictions in the future. The SJC ruled that the DPU lacked
the statutory authority to consider <I>societal </I>impacts, while
affirming that risks to <I>ratepayers </I>associated with the
costs of future regulations is a valid consideration.
<P>
The FERC recently ruled in California regarding the avoided cost
payments made to QF's under PURPA, and addressed how non-price
factors and externalities may be applied to these payments.<SUP>
<A HREF = "#FN5">5</A></SUP> PURPA's avoided cost standard can be construed as &quot;allowing
consideration of non-price factors essential to integrated resource
planning.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN6">6</A></SUP> In particular, Commissioner Massey
emphasized that the FERC decision &quot;does not preclude states
from considering environmental costs in determining avoided costs
under PURPA.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN7">7</A></SUP> What is not clear is how these
non-price factors can be taken into account. FERC clearly pointed
to state tax laws as an acceptable mechanism.
<P>
<A Name = "1.3"></A><B>1.3 Approach of This Report</B>
<P>
An important objective of this report is to express values for
the benefits of DSM in specific quantitative and monetary terms
wherever possible. This approach should not be interpreted as
a position that monetization is the only, or even the best, method
for incorporating externalities and other policy factors into
electric power system planning. In some instances, the valuation
of environmental resources in monetary terms may be reasonable
and appropriate. The dollar value can then applied through a tax
or an &quot;externality adder&quot; in order to appropriately
incorporate that impact into utility planning. In other cases,
valuation may be difficult, impossible, or simply inappropriate,
and setting targets may be a better policy approach. In such instances,
where a <I>policy target</I> might be set for a state, region
or entire country, an &quot;externality adder&quot; might be a
useful <I>instrument</I> for the implementation of that policy.
<P>
However, some policy goals simply do not fit the category of &quot;externality&quot;.
These can, for example, relate to equity between individuals,
classes of customers, citizens of different states, or members
of different generations. Such equity considerations have to some
extent been, and should continue to be, recognized in utility
planning and DSM screening. Such distributional issues do not
readily lend themselves to economic valuation. For example, &quot;willingness
to pay&quot;, a key concept for economic analysis, may be constrained
by low-income customers' ability to pay. Similarly, future generations
are not available to express their views. Nonetheless, quantitative
analysis of distributional issues can be illuminating, and policy
factors for incorporating equity considerations into utility planning
may take a quantitative form.
<P>
Over the past several years, the range of &quot;other non-price
factors affecting the costs or benefits of the electrical service
(e.g., reliability, fuel diversity)&quot; has come under increasing
scrutiny. DSM represents an important policy choice for avoiding
adverse impacts on health, environment, and public amenity that
result from society's need for electrical power -- impacts that
include the societal costs of energy use associated with the entire
fuel cycle, not simply the impacts at the point of generation.
Furthermore, DSM programs targeted to low-income customers can
provide important societal benefits beyond those related to the
customer's energy consumption. DSM can also have a beneficial
impact upon direct utility costs through decreasing arrears and
by decreasing exposure to risks of future environmental regulation.
In addition, DSM programs have other social associated with job
creation, government subsidies, oil import costs, and depletion
of natural resources.
<P>
To quantify the benefits of DSM programs in New England, we have
examined total DSM programs for regional utilities that have made
substantial investments in DSM. Table 1.1 shows data for the three
utilities in New England with the largest 1993 expenditures on
energy efficiency programs. In our study, we considered DSM programs
to be equivalent to 100 MW of generating capacity. This is slightly
less that 101 MW of DSM savings that the Boston Edison Company
(BECo), has developed through 1993. It can be considered as a
lower bound figure when compared to the 267 MW which the Connecticut
Light &amp; Power achieved in 1993.

On the other hand, the 100 MW of DSM savings is essentially a
hypothetical quantity of savings that we have chosen for our illustrative
calculations. We make the simplifying assumption that the 100
MW of DSM savings is made up of a similar mix of DSM programs
as New England's current and future programs. This assumption
implies that the 100 MW will have a &quot;load factor&quot; of
roughly 60 percent, and associated energy savings of roughly 525
GWh. For each non-price factor, two scenarios are specified, a
low impact scenario and a high impact scenario, details of which
are given in the subsections that follow.<P>

<A Name = "2.0"></A><H1>2. BENEFITS OF NEW ENGLAND'S DSM PROGRAMS</H1>
<A Name = "2.1"></A><H2>2.1 Avoided Emissions of Criteria Air Pollutants and Greenhouse Gases</H2>
<P>
Criteria air pollutants include those that have been designated
by the EPA, under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, with National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set to protect human health
and welfare. The list of criteria pollutants includes sulfur dioxide
(SO<SUB>2</SUB>), volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxide
(NO<SUB>X</SUB>), total suspended particulates (TSP), carbon monoxide
(CO), lead, and others. 
<P>
Greenhouse gases include those pollutants which increase the heat-trapping
capacity of the earth's atmosphere and contribute to global warming.
The primary greenhouse gases emitted from power plants include
carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), nitrous
oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O).
<P>
In 1990, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU)
adopted a policy requiring utilities to add monetary values of
five criteria pollutants and three greenhouse gases to the costs
of new generation facilities, as part of their integrated resource
plans. The monetary values chosen by the DPU for these air pollutants,
in terms of dollars per ton emitted, are presented in Table 2.1.
These values were subsequently thrown out by the Supreme Judicial
Court which ruled that the DPU lacked the statutory authority
to consider <I>societal </I>impacts, but affirmed the DPU's role
in ordering that utilities consider the risk of future regulations.

The monetary values of the criteria air pollutants have been estimated
using the &quot;regulator's revealed preference&quot; methodology,
sometimes referred to as the control cost approach. The monetary
values of the greenhouse gases have been estimated using the costs
of maintaining a target amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, as
well as the relative global warming potential of the remaining
two pollutants relative to carbon dioxide.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN8">8</A></SUP>
<P>
The purpose of our analysis here is to apply the Massachusetts
DPU monetary values to generation resources on the NEPOOL system,
in order to provide a rough indication of the magnitude of the
cost of these pollutants, and to compare these pollutants with
other non-price factors. Accordingly, the DPU values for each
criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas have been converted into
monetary costs by assuming that DSM programs displace energy from
oil and natural gas plants on the NEPOOL margin.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN9">9</A></SUP>
The results are summarized in Table 2.2, which indicates that
the total costs of these air pollutants combined can be as high
as 5.45 cents/kWh.

For New England, we estimate that for the high impact scenario
the potential impacts of 100 MW of DSM for the NEPOOL margin is
$27 million, for generation-related greenhouse gas and criteria
air pollutant emissions. If upstream emissions are considered,
DSM programs save an additional $1.5 million. In the low impact
scenario, if the DSM were to displace generation from a new gas
combined cycle plant with steam water injection and selective
catalytic reduction, the benefits would amount to $6.9 million,
representing only the emissions associated with generation. If
upstream emissions are considered, DSM programs save an additional
$5.4 million.<P>
<A Name = "2.2"></A><H2>2.2 Heavy Metals</H2>
<P>
During combustion of coal and oil, heavy metals which occur naturally
in coal and oil deposits are released into the air, either in
a gaseous phase or bound to particles. Once released into the
environment, metals are persistent.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN10">10</A></SUP><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT>People may be exposed to these metals through several pathways,
including inhalation. Through atmospheric deposition, metals can
be deposited on soil, in lakes, and in streams. Contaminated soil
may present a health risk due to ingestion of soil (especially
for children) and ingestion of crops which may take up the metal.
Metal deposition in lakes and streams may impact fish, humans,
and other species consuming these fish.
<P>
In general, two types of health impacts may occur - acute and
chronic. Acute health impacts, which may be reversible, are associated
with short term exposures to high concentrations of metals. However,
fossil fuel combustion can also result in long term exposure to
lower concentrations. These can cause chronic health effects which
typically are not reversible.
<P>
To date, very few air toxics have been regulated in the United
States. Title III of the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)
of 1990 lists 189 hazardous air pollutants which are to be regulated
on a source-by-source basis. Sources for each air pollutant will
be listed and regulations are still to be promulgated for each
air pollutant from each source. The CAAA directs the EPA administrator
to perform a study of the public health hazards associated with
hazardous air emissions from electric generation facilities, and
to regulate these emissions if deemed necessary by the EPA study.
<P>
Until recently, little attention has been given to the study of
air toxics. To date we are aware of only two methodologies for
estimating the monetary values of air toxics. The first method
develops the <I>marginal cost of control</I> for arsenic, chromium
and lead by assessing the marginal cost of complying with Massachusetts
regulations pertaining to those three pollutants, including standards
for arsenic emissions from copper smelters, chromium emissions
from cooling towers, and lead emissions from secondary lead smelters.
(Chernick and Caverhill 1991).
<P>
The second methodology is to develop <I>relative toxicities</I>
of each heavy metal by comparing their potential health impacts
to another heavy metal whose marginal cost of control is already
known. This methodology assumes that society's willingness to
pay to avoid damages from heavy metals is proportional to their
relative toxicities. For example, the monetary value of lead can
be determined using the marginal cost of complying with Massachusetts
regulations, as described above. The monetary value of another
metal which is twice as toxic as lead should be assigned twice
the monetary value of lead.
<P>
We recommend inferring relative toxicities from the Massachusetts
Allowable Ambient Limits (AAL) for the heavy metals. The AAL values
are an annual average exposure concentration designed to protect
human health. They are established by the Massachusetts Department
of Environmental Protection. The AAL values are preferable to
the alternative &quot;reference doses&quot; determined by the
EPA, because they consider both non-cancer and cancer health effects.
<P>
The resulting monetary values of heavy metals (in dollars per
pound of pollutant) are presented in Table 2.3. We present a range
of low and high values, derived by applying the relative toxicities
to arsenic, chromium and lead. The significant breadth of the
range for many heavy metals is an indication of the uncertainty
embodied in these values.

Accordingly, these values have been converted into monetary costs
by assuming that DSM programs displace energy from oil and natural

Table 2.4, which indicates that the upper range costs of these
air toxics can be as high as 0.28 cents/kWh.
<P>
For New England, we estimate that for the high impact scenario
the potential impacts of 100 MW of DSM for the NEPOOL margin is
$1.5 million. For the low impact scenario, the lower bound of
air toxic values was used, yielding a cost of about $0.1 million.
<A Name = "2.3"></A><H2>2.3 Water Use Impacts</H2>
<P>
Electricity generation affects water resources at the point of
fuel mining and extraction, at the point of fuel combustion, and
at the point of waste disposal. Water use impacts can compromise
the integrity of aquatic systems, the viability of their biota,
as well as the health and amenity of the human populations that
they serve.
<P>
Fuel mining and extraction activities can have adverse water quality
impacts as a result of water drainage from mines, leaching and
erosion of solid wastes from mining and cleaning plants, slurry
dewatering, and modification of aquifers. Mining activities can
affect both surface and groundwater supplies. For coal mines,
potentially severe problems are created by acid drainage from
both underground and surface mines and from coal waste storage
piles. For uranium mines, the construction of dikes creates a
loss of aquatic habitat. More significantly, drainage from uranium
mine tailings can increase the concentration of dissolved radium
in surface waters; sometimes leading to acute short-term poisoning,
and sometimes leading to chronic long-term poisoning of aquatic
populations.

<P>
For oil and gas exploration, offshore and terminal operations
result in some discharge to surrounding waters. Tidal marshes,
coastal wetlands, river swamps, and sheltered bays support organisms
that may be affected by low levels of hydrocarbons. Brine separation
and transport incidents may also have impact on local water bodies.
<P>
At the point of generation, power plants can have three types
of direct impacts on water systems: impacts on aquatic populations
from water intake systems, thermal discharges into water bodies,
and solids and toxic chemical discharges into water bodies.
<P>
Most of the waste impacts result from the cooling process in thermal
power plants. Therefore, water impacts will depend largely upon
the type of cooling system used. In <I>once-through cooling</I>
systems, water is taken from a local body of water, passed through
steam condensers, and discharged at an elevated temperature. In
<I>closed-cycle cooling</I>, cooling water is circulated through
cooling towers to transfer heat to the atmosphere, and then recirculated
through the plant. Closed cycle cooling systems tend to have lower
water impacts than once-through.
<P>
The primary impacts on aquatic populations from water intake systems
include (a) <I>entrapment</I>, when fish and crustaceans are affected
by the currents that are created as large volumes of water are
drawn into power plants; (b) <I>impingement</I>, when large aquatic
organisms are trapped on the intake screens that are used to prevent
them from entering the power plant; and (c) <I>entrainment</I>,
when those aquatic organisms small enough to pass through the
intake screens enter the cooling pipes and are drawn through the
cooling system. Impingement losses can be considerable. A study
of the Great Lakes estimated that fish kills in excess of 40 million
per year result from the 90 once-through thermal electric stations
on the shores of the Great Lakes. (Ottinger et al., 1990)
<P>
Thermal discharges of cooling water from power plants can have
adverse ecosystem impacts in a variety of ways. Organisms respond
to changes in the aquatic environment with both behavioral and
physiological responses, including death. Submerged vegetation
can be increased or decreased in the nearby waters, thereby changing
the associated fauna, reproductive sites, and nesting areas of
organisms. New organisms may be attracted by the thermal effluent,
while some existing organisms may be repelled by them, resulting
in further modifications to the nearby habitat. Unanticipated
plant shutdowns or emergency responses can cause sudden changes
to cooling water usage, resulting in thermal shock to the nearby
aquatic environment.
<P>
Solids and toxic chemical discharges into water bodies result
from numerous operations within the plant, including: once-through
cooling processes, cooling tower blowdown, bottom ash and fly
ash transport water, chemical metal cleaning wastes, ion exchange
water treatment systems, and discharges from wet air pollution
control devices. Many types of water pollutants have been detected
in power plant effluent, with major classes including: dissolved
solids; chlorine residual; chlorinated organic compounds; corrosion
products such as copper and zinc; residual anti-corrosion/anti-scaling
water treatment chemicals; and grease and oil. To our knowledge,
no study has assessed the external cost of these water pollutants
from power plants.
<P>
Finally, power plants can have water use impacts at the point
of waste disposal. Waste streams associated with electricity generation
are disposed of in landfills or surface ponds. Once landfilled,
ash constituents may enter groundwater if the landfill lacks a
liner, leachate collection and monitoring systems. Water runoff
from the landfill may cause contamination of local surface waters.
Similarly, water overflow in surface ponds may also carry pollutants
into surface waters.
<P>
Water use impacts from all stages of electricity production tend
to be highly site-specific. In addition, relatively few studies
has been performed which attempt to quantify, or to monetize,
the environmental impacts of water usage. In theory, it would
be possible to develop monetary values of water impacts, using
the regulators' revealed preference methodology, for water intake
impacts, thermal discharge impacts, chemical discharge impacts,
and waste disposal impacts. 
<P>
However, we are aware of only one study that has developed monetary
values for any of these impacts. The Pace study estimated the
control costs of fish impingement resulting from cooling water
intake. Using an assumed fish impingement rate of 0.00061 fish/kWh,
the study estimated mitigation costs that ranged from 0.005 to
0.02 cents/kWh. To our knowledge, monetary values have not been
developed for the many other water use impacts described above.
<P>
For New England, we have estimated the potential impacts of 100
MW of DSM savings for water intake impacts only, because we have
not found monetary values of other water use impacts that are
sufficiently comprehensive. Under a high impact scenario, the
total cost is about $1.1 million; under the low impact scenario,
the total cost is about $0.3 million.
<A Name = "2.4"></A><H2>2.4 Land Use Impacts </H2>
<P>
Electric power facilities can have a variety of land use impacts,
including those from fuel extraction and mining, impacts from
the power plants themselves, and impacts as a result of waste
disposal. 
<P>
Mining activities can create impacts on terrestrial biota and
other land resources, e.g., forced migration and threats to endangered
species. Surface mining can have environmental and economic impacts
as a result of the removal of land from its use as farmland, forest
or rangeland. In addition, spoil from improperly controlled mines
can result in erosion and landslides, while unreclaimed coal highwalls
can be a major aesthetic problem. In some cases, noise and visual
impacts extend beyond mine boundaries, and affect wildlife habitats
and recreational activities in a larger area.
<P>
The amount of land used for the construction and operation of
power plants varies significantly by the type of plant. Coal plants
typically require significantly more land space due to coal preparation
and on-site waste disposal. According to the U.S. DOE, natural
gas and oil fired generators tend to require roughly 0.1 square
yards per MWh of generation, while conventional coal plants require
approximately 10 times that amount (1.2 sq. yards/MWh). Nuclear
plants also require a great deal of land space. Pressurized Water
Reactors use slightly more than conventional coal (1.5 sq. yards/MWh),
while Boiling Water Reactors require nearly twice that amount
(2.7 sq. yards/MWh) (US DOE 1983).
<P>
Hydroelectric facilities can also create land-use impacts, depending
upon the type and configuration of the installation, the mode
of operation, the environmental characteristics of the site, and
the use of the surrounding lands. Flooding of land behind a dam
can inundate large areas of forest, farmland, and even towns,
destroying a wide range of wildlife habitats and flora. Adverse
biological effects on fish life can be caused by the obstruction
of downstream sediment movement, the buildup of anaerobic gases,
obstruction of spawning pathways, and increased salt and mineral
contents. In addition, socio-economic impacts can occur as previous
recreational and commercial waters are impacted -- although creation
of the reservoir may also present alternative recreational and
commercial opportunities.
<P>
Energy distribution facilities such as gas or oil pipelines can
have a host of potential impacts on land use. The construction
and maintenance of pipelines and related facilities may affect
farming, forestry, and tourism, and may impair the aesthetics
and general amenity of life in the neighboring communities. In
addition, local employment might rise as a result of construction
and maintenance of pipelines, but at the cost of displacing or
disrupting existing communities. Several pipeline projects have
been stopped in part because they interfered with aboriginal communities;
while other projects have required payments ranging from four
to eight percent of the value of the project to protect tribal
fisheries and other traditional assets.
<P>
Finally, the land required for the disposal of solid wastes produced
by generating facilities may be substantial. For example, a 500
MW coal plant requires approximately 300 acres of land for disposing
of solid waste -- equal to over one-third of the land required
for the location of the plant itself.
<P>
Unlike many of the other non-price factors reviewed in this report,
part of the value of the land that is used for electricity generation
is reflected in the price that the utility must pay for the land.
However, a number of external costs remain. Converting open space
to an industrialized application involves a range of aesthetic,
recreational and ecosystem diversity impacts. In addition, plant
sites can have health, environmental, aesthetic, and noise impacts
which lower the value of surrounding properties. Furthermore,
the volume of combustion wastes from fossil fuel plants creates
pressure on landfill space, and accelerates the need for additional
landfill areas. The on-going controversy regarding the U.S. DOE's
inability to find a publicly-acceptable site for the disposal
of nuclear wastes indicates the degree of land use impacts that
extend beyond the price of the land.
<P>
The land-use impacts from every stage of electricity production
are highly site-specific, and will depend largely upon the facility
type, the surrounding geography, wildlife characteristics and
demographics. In addition, there have been very few studies performed
to develop monetary values of land-use impacts. Therefore, we
do not recommend that any particular value be used at this time
in New England.
<A Name = "2.5"></A><H2>2.5 Radiological Impacts of Nuclear Power </H2>
<P>
Emissions of radionuclides occur at each stage of the nuclear
fuel cycle. Some of the radionuclides are very long-lived and
will continue to decay over thousands of years, suggesting that
today's nuclear power plants may result in impacts that will last
over many generations. Other radionuclides are very short-lived,
but may nonetheless result in intense exposure due to the type
of radioactivity emitted.
<P>
Uranium tailings piles, associated with the mining and extraction
of nuclear fuels, release a variety of radionuclides into the
atmosphere. Of principle concern is radon (Rn-222) -- an inert
gas with a short half-life (less than four days), but which is
released into the atmosphere virtually forever because one of
its precursors (Th-230) has a half-life of 80,000 years. Depending
upon the future condition of the tailing pile, adverse health
effects may arise from radon and its daughters as they are inhaled,
deposited, and retained in the respiratory system.
<P>
A variety of radionuclides are routinely emitted from the operation
of nuclear generating stations as well. The emissions are routinely
produced by nuclear reactions occurring in the fuel, in the moderator
or heat transport systems, and in structural components. Radioactive
emission rates vary depending on structural design characteristics,
power rating, emission control systems, and waste handling methods.
The general public is exposed to radiation through a variety of
air and water pathways.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN11">11</A></SUP> 
<P>
The most uncertain factor in estimating externality costs from
nuclear power generation is the risk of possible catastrophic
radionuclide releases due to accidents. Opinions diverge greatly
regarding the frequency of a catastrophic release, the exposure
of local, regional and global populations, and the dose-response
relationships. Some recent studies conclude that external costs
associated with possible reactor accidents may account for the
largest single contribution to total nuclear externality costs.
<P>
Nuclear reactors could suffer an accident for a number of reasons.
Much of the analysis has focused on the possibility of a loss
of coolant accident (LOCA) which involves the rupture of a large
cooling pipe. However, many other accident scenarios are possible,
as well as multiple event combinations leading to a major accident.
The worst-case scenario occurs when severe core damage results
in the release of much of the radionuclide inventory into the
containment and eventually to the environment.
<P>
Finally, nuclear power plants produce nuclear waste which can
also release radionuclides into the environment. Low-level wastes
will remain hazardous for hundreds of years. Occupational exposure
to radionuclides can result from workers handling, packaging,
and storing the wastes. Moreover, long-term exposure may result
from radioactive effluent from waste buried in trenches and in-ground
containers. Another potential source of exposure is associated
with the possibility of accidents during handling, transport,
and final disposal. In the US, accidents during transport and
handling have produced contamination beyond the boundaries of
low-level waste sites. Long-term options for permanent storage
of low-level wastes are still under review.
<P>
High-level wastes consist primarily of spent fuel generated by
the nuclear fission process, and can remain highly radioactive
for thousands of years. High-level wastes are also subject to
occupational and accident-related risks. High-level wastes are
currently stored on the site of the generation facilities, pending
the development of a temporary or permanent storage site.
<P>
Estimating the direct physical impacts of damages due to radionuclide
emissions is a complex task replete with uncertainties, scientific
disagreements, and unresolved issues. Impacts will depend upon
a variety of factors, including the actual level of emissions
into air, water and soil; the transport of radionuclides through
those media, based on climatological and topographical conditions;
the exposure of receptor areas or populations, and the dose-response
relationship of those populations.
<P>
The primary emphasis in the literature that we reviewed was on
the human health impacts of radionuclide releases. Bioaccumulation
of radionuclides in many other kinds of living organisms can also
be significantly affected by the nuclear fuel cycle. Accordingly,
the results presented here should not be seen as encompassing
the full range of environmental and health impacts of radionuclide
releases.
<P>
Most of the studies we reviewed determined monetary values of
radionuclide emissions using the &quot;damage cost&quot; methodology.
One of the central assumptions in this approach is the dollar
value of a human life. While a broad range of values have been
used, the Pace study recommends a &quot;middle ground&quot; value
of a statistical human life of $4 million (Ottinger et al., 1990).
Alternatively, it is reasonable to assume $10,000 for a dose commitment
of one person-rem.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN1"2>12</A></SUP> This value is used by the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a guideline to determine if a
risk-reducing plant modification is economically justified.
<P>
Table 2.5 summarizes the results of several estimates of the dollar
costs of radionuclide emissions from uranium mining, routine reactor
operations, risk of nuclear accident, decommissioning and disposal
of nuclear wastes. This table indicates the wide range of estimates
that exist for each of the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. It
also indicates that the risk of nuclear accidents, and the long-term
radon releases from unstabilized tailings piles, could potentially
have the greatest environmental impacts.
<P>
In New England, for the low impact scenario, these avoided costs
will be zero, because nuclear fuel production, generation and
disposal will not be affected by reducing the energy generated
on the NEPOOL margin. However, in the high impact scenario where
we assume that the DSM will avoid nuclear generation, the avoided
costs could be as high as $1.2 billion, dwarfing the other non-price
benefits of DSM. Most of this impact is due to the cost of long-term
radon releases from tailings piles that we have assumed will be
unstable.
<A Name = "2.6"></A><H2>2.6 Electricity Transmission and Distribution Impacts </H2>
<P>
There are a number of adverse health and environmental impacts
associated with electricity transmission and distribution (T&amp;D)
systems. Over the past decade, concern over siting of new T&amp;D
lines has become one of the more controversial topics of the electricity
industry.
<P>
Transmission towers are required to have a right-of-way, which
is an open space on either side of the line, used primarily for
safety, protection and maintenance. Construction and maintenance
of the right-of-way may cause local adverse impacts on soil, drainage
patterns, flora and fauna. New techniques in right-of-way management
have served to decrease considerably the impact on wildlife habitats.
However, powerline construction practices vary widely; careful
operations are able to mitigate land impacts, while poorly executed
operations may impose significant environmental impacts.
<P>
<Center>
<IMG ALT="Table 2.5" SRC ="tab25.gif">
</Center>
<P>
The maintenance and operation of a transmission
line and its right-of-way can have a negative effect on local
surface water quality and aquatic ecology. Where service roads
cross wetlands and surface waters, soil erosion can induce elevated
turbidity, sedimentation, and toxic effects from herbicide runoff.
Land values in rural areas can also be affected by the siting
of transmission lines, due to the interference posed to agricultural
production, irrigation schemes, and aerial pesticide applications.
<P>
In addition, small amounts of ozone and substantially smaller
levels of nitrogen oxides are produced along the length of the
transmission line by a phenomenon known as corona, a &quot;high
energy discharge&quot; which occurs when air ionizes on the conductor
surface. Transmission lines also result in negative aesthetic
and noise impacts. The noise impacts of transmission lines are
result of the corona effect on high voltage transmission lines.
<P>
A part of the value of the land that is used for electricity T&amp;D
is reflected in the price that the utility must pay for the land.
However, a number of external costs remain. Converting open space
to an industrialized application involves a range of aesthetic,
recreational and ecosystem diversity impacts. In addition, T&amp;D
lines can have a number of impacts which lower the value of surrounding
properties.
<P>
Much of the present controversy about T&amp;D systems is caused
by the concern about adverse biological effects of exposure to
electromagnetic fields (EMF). Although the epidemiological data
remains inconclusive, several studies suggest that exposure to
EMF may cause increased cancer risk. The increased risk is especially
pronounced for childhood leukemia.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN13">13</A></SUP> When viewed as
a whole, the literature suggests that EMF may not necessarily
be a cancer initiator, but it may be a cancer promoter.
<P>
To our knowledge, there has not yet been any study which develops
monetary values for the land-use impacts of T&amp;D systems. There
are reasonable approaches to estimating monetary values, such
as assessing the reductions in market values of the land used
and the surrounding properties. 
<P>
However, such techniques have not yet been applied.
<P>
Similarly, we are not aware of any study that has developed monetary
values for EMF impacts. In fact, the very existence of EMF impacts
is still heavily debated. Nonetheless, some analysts and policy-makers
have proposed a policy of &quot;prudent avoidance&quot; as a guiding
approach in T&amp;D planning and siting. The underlying principle
behind this approach is that the scientific evidence suggests
that EMF health risks are credible, even if they have not been
fully quantified or demonstrated. As a result, it is prudent to
take reasonable steps to avoid EMF health risks. Some Public Service
Commissions such as Wisconsin now require utilities, when proposing
transmission line projects, to consider the number of persons
potentially exposed to EMF, and to use low-EMF design structures
where practical.
<P>
Because of the lack of information available regarding monetary
values for T&amp;D impacts, we do not recommend that any particular
value be used at this time in New England. However, we do recommend
that the policy of prudent avoidance be applied for all transmission
and siting considerations.
<A Name = "2.7"></A><H2>2.7 Job Creation and Economic Development</H2>
<P>
Demand-side management can contribute to economic development
and job creation in a number of ways. First, implementing DSM
programs creates jobs in a variety of trades, such as carpenters,
plumbers, contractors, architects, engineers, and the many jobs
related to the production of energy efficiency products. 
<P>
Second, DSM reduces the cost of electricity, and thereby creates
additional jobs through &quot;respending&quot; effects. Residential
customers will have lower electricity bills, which provides them
with more disposable income to spend on goods and services, thus
expanding local markets. Commercial and industrial customers will
have lower production costs on average, and will therefore be
more competitive. Businesses and industries may pass on these
cost savings to customers by lowering their product prices, thus
expanding their market shares. They may also pass on some of the
cost savings in the form of profits to investors, resulting in
increased disposable income, which may further stimulate economic
activity and growth.
<P>
Third, DSM stimulates the production of goods and services that
are well-placed for future markets, and creates a manufacturing
base and fosters skills in an commercial area that may support
the local economy in the long-term. Fourth, DSM can improve the
quality of power delivered to businesses and industries, by reducing
outages, voltage surges, and bad frequency control. Finally, by
improving environmental quality in general, DSM can act as a stimulus
for attracting new businesses and residents.
<P>
Most of the literature on this topic focuses on the first two
effects -- the creation of jobs through implementation of DSM
and through respending effects. In almost all cases these job
impacts are estimated using an input-output (I-O) model. I-O models
can compute the increase in output, income, and employment in
all sectors of the economy that are affected when money is spent
on a specific product.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN14">14</A></SUP> 
<P>
Typically, an I-O analysis is applied to compare two projects;
for example, a new power plant versus a package of DSM projects.
The employment effect of DSM is determined by first taking the
difference between gross jobs created by the DSM and the gross
jobs created by the alternative power plant. The <I>net employment
effect</I> of DSM is then determined by adding in the jobs created
by the respending effect. The same approach could be used to compare
two alternative resource plans, each with their own combination
of DSM and supply-side options.
<P>
Table 2.6 summarizes some results of selected DSM I-O employment
studies. For each study, the table presents gross, respending,
and net employment effects of DSM relative to different supply-side
resources. Table 2.6 also presents the gross employment effects
in terms of jobs per million dollars spent to acquire a resource.
Finally, Table 2.8 presents a ratio of jobs created by DSM over
jobs created by supply-side resources. This ratio includes the
respending effects in the DSM jobs, and therefore captures the
net DSM employment effect relative to supply-side resources.
<P>
As demonstrated in Table 2.6, most studies find that gross employment
effects from DSM are roughly comparable to gross employment effects
of supply-side resources, and that the respending effect accounts
for the primary difference in employment impacts. The DSM/supply
job ratio suggests that when the respending effect is taken into
account, DSM programs tend to generate roughly 1.5 to 4 times
more jobs than supply-side resources.
<P>
In addition, the results in Table 2.6 indicate the extent to which
estimates of employment impacts will differ widely depending upon
the type and size of the DSM program, and the size and type of
the alternative supply-side resource. The range of results presented
in Table 2.6 demonstrates the many variables and uncertainties
involved in estimating job impacts, and suggest that caution be
used in directly applying the results.
<P>
The number of jobs presented in the table above does not capture
a variety of qualitative aspects of job creation. Employment in
the energy efficiency sector has a number of advantages over employment
in traditional utility construction and maintenance. For example,
conservation employment tends to be more evenly distributed over
time, providing a more sustained stimulus to the economy. As another
example, DSM employment utilizes labor with generally applicable
skills (e.g., carpenters, electricians, architects) that are often
available in the local economy. In contrast, utility plant construction
requires highly specialized labor that often has to be imported.
<P>
Estimating the potential job impacts of DSM programs would require
an in-depth economic analysis of the specific programs and the
types of supply-side resources that they would avoid.
Nonetheless, it is useful to present a simple, illustrative calculation
of the amount of employment that might be generated by a hypothetical
100 MW of DSM, as presented in Table 2.2.
<P>
For our low impact scenario, we assume that the gross employment
of DSM is equivalent to the gross employment of the avoided supply-side
resource, which means that the only employment impacts will result
from respending effects. We then assume that New England DSM programs
will result in respending employment of roughly 5 jobs per million
(i.e., the lowest end of the range from Table 2.6), and that the
typical New England utility continues to spend roughly $50 million
per year for the next ten years. These assumptions imply that
our hypothetical DSM programs will result in the creation of approximately
2,500 local jobs over those ten years. To the extent that these
programs are more cost-effective, additional jobs will be created.
<P>
In the high impact scenario, we assume that DSM does not avoid
any new supply-side capacity, but only avoids marginal energy
on the NEPOOL system. As a result, there will be significantly
less gross employment from the supply-side, because the DSM is
only avoiding the fuel and operations and maintenance costs of
supply-side resources. We therefore assume that the gross employment
from the supply-side is roughly 10 jobs per million dollars spent
(the low end of the range from Table 2.6), and that the DSM gross
employment will be roughly 20 jobs per million dollars spent (taken
from the low to middle end of the range presented in Table 2.6).
Again assuming that roughly $50 million per year in DSM expenditures
for the next ten years, there would be a total of 5,000 more job-years
created form the gross DSM employment than the gross supply-side
employment. Finally, we assume that the respending effect will
result in 20 jobs per million dollars spent, resulting in an additional
10,000 job-years of employment. The total employment impact of
this high scenario would then be 15,000 job-years over the next
ten years.
<P>
It is also important to consider <I>whether</I>, and <I>how</I>,
employment impacts should be accounted for in evaluating DSM programs.
In general, employment impacts are not necessarily an externality
because they are accounted for in prices and in the economic marketplace
in general. Therefore, employment impacts cannot be simply added
to the &quot;total cost to society&quot; in the way that, for
example, environmental externalities can. However, there are many
instances where policy-makers decide that improving local economic
development is desirable. Accordingly, the job creation impacts
can be considered a &quot;policy factor,&quot; which is somehow
qualitatively accounted for when evaluating resource options.
Clearly, the creation of 2,500 to 10,000 job-years has important
public policy implications that should be accounted for in evaluating
DSM programs.

<P>
In addition, it is important to note that as New England utilities
implement DSM programs whose costs are close to avoided costs,
the employment effects from respending (the primary employment
benefits) will be significantly reduced. If DSM programs are implemented
that are significantly less than avoided costs, than employment
impacts should play a greater role in evaluating different resource
options.
<A Name = "2.8"></A><H2>2.8 Government Subsidies for Energy Resources</H2>
<P>
The U.S. energy market is supported by a host of subsidies that
affect the market prices and the mix of energy sources. For example:
<UL>
<LI>A variety of federal tax benefits are offered in the form
of preferential tax rates, tax exemptions, tax deferrals, tax
credits, and measures that reduce taxable income. Tax benefits
are probably the most pervasive form of energy subsidy. 
<LI>Government agency programs support different energy resources
by providing research and development, loan guarantees and other
grants, and maintenance of energy-related operations that supply
products and services to energy producers at low cost.
<LI>Some regulatory interventions constitute preferential treatment
of certain energy sources. For example, the Price-Anderson Act
of 1959 limits the liability of nuclear power accidents, significantly
reducing insurance or liability costs for nuclear power plants.
Other interventions include price and import/export regulations,
and government procurement guidelines.
<LI>State and local governments also provide subsidies, primarily
by exempting energy products from a sales tax, reducing income
and property taxes of utilities, and subsidizing the production
of raw energy materials. 
</UL>
<P>
A summary of the results of the most recent, comprehensive assessment
of federal subsidies for energy resources is provided in Table
2.7, which presents high and low estimates of annual federal subsidies
in 1989. (ASE and Koplow 1993) The high case estimates indicate
that federal energy subsidies were roughly $42 billion, with $21
billion of that going towards tax breaks, and $18 billion going
towards federal agency programs.
<P>
In general, nuclear and fossil fuels receive most of the federal
subsidies. The authors estimate that nuclear and coal fuels received
roughly 24 percent of the total federal subsidies each, while
oil and renewable energy receive roughly 2 percent each.<SUP>
<A HREF = "#FN15">15</A></SUP> As indicated in Table 2.7, the Price Anderson Act is
estimated to be the second largest single component of federal
subsidies to energy resources.
<P>
It would be difficult to identify any federal or state energy
subsidies that could be avoided by DSM programs on the NEPOOL
system. Nonetheless, these subsidies do represent a cost associated
with certain resource types. It is therefore useful to estimate
the magnitude of that cost on a per unit (i.e., cents/KWh) basis,
in order to compare this cost across different resource types.
<P>
For example, Table 2.7 indicates that total federal subsidies
in 1989 amounted to roughly $25 to $42 billion. The nuclear electricity
share of this was 24 percent, and nuclear electricity generation
in 1989 was 529 billion kWh. This implies a range of nuclear subsidies
of roughly 1.1 to 1.9 cents/kWh (in 1994$). These subsidies are
significant, given that the cost of nuclear fuel is roughly 1
cent/kWh.
<P>
Similarly, the coal electricity share of the total was 24 percent,
and U.S. coal-fired electricity generation in 1989 was 1,454 billion
kWh, implying a range of coal subsidies of roughly 0.4 to 0.7
cents/kWh (in 1994$). These subsidies are also significant, given
that the production costs of coal are roughly 1.5 to 2 cents/kWh.
<P>
It is also useful to estimate the potential impact of these subsidies
in the context of avoided costs of the hypothetical 100 MW of
DSM savings, and the associated 525 GWh of energy savings. For
the low impact scenario, we assume that the DSM avoids coal generation
entirely, and we assume the high estimate of coal subsidies, resulting
in roughly $3.8 million of federal subsidies. For the high impact
scenario, we assume that DSM avoids nuclear generation entirely,
and we assume the high estimate of nuclear subsidies, resulting
roughly $10.2 million of federal subsidies.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN16">16</A></SUP>
<P>
It is important to note that subsidies for energy facilities are
not externalities, because they actually represent a transfer
of costs from utility ratepayers to taxpayers. Nevertheless, reducing
federal subsidies can imply a positive welfare effect. Federal
energy subsidies may be appropriate when there are positive external
effects associated with the product being supported. However,
when this is not the case, subsidization leads to an inefficient
allocation of resources and hence a loss in welfare.
<A Name = "2.9"></A><H2>2.9 The Costs of Relying Upon Imported Oil</H2>
<P>
In the wake of the oil crises of the 1970's, some analysts have
claimed that there are large, measurable costs to dependence on
oil, beyond those reflected in the current price. The argument
is that the concentration of ownership of world oil supplies causes
vulnerability to future supply shocks. Use of fuels subject to
sudden disruptions then adds costs and risks to the economy as
a whole.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN17">17</A></SUP>
<P>
<Center>
<A HREF = "tab27.gif"><IMG ALT="Table 2.7" SRC ="tab27sm.gif"><P>
Click to display large table</A>

</Center>
<P>
To the extent that the consumption of foreign oil increases U.S. security needs, oil consumption gives
rise to externalities. A study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory
estimates an annual cost to the U.S. economy due to the monopolization
of the world oil industry, of roughly $100 billion to $400 billion
from 1972 to 1991. (Greene and Leiby 1993) This cost includes
monopoly-induced transfer of U.S. wealth to foreign oil producers,
loss of potential output due to the increased price of oil, and
macroeconomic adjustment costs precipitated by oil price shocks.
<P>
In addition, some analysts argue that military costs attributable
to oil dependence, and protection of U.S. interests in oil producing
countries, may equal billions of dollars per year. Furthermore,
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, costing about $1 billion annually,
is another cost to the U.S. government of reducing the risk of
oil supply. 
<P>
On the other hand, studies by Resources for the Future indicate
that the magnitudes of costs of reliance on imported oil are not
well understood. These studies find that the evidence does not
support a conclusion that the market fails to internalize the
risks of oil supply shocks. (Bohi and Toman 1992).
<P>
It would be difficult to identify any particular cost of relying
upon foreign oil that would be avoided by DSM programs on the
NEPOOL system. Nonetheless, these costs do represent a cost associated
with the use of oil. It is therefore useful to estimate the magnitude
of that cost on a per-unit (i.e., cents/kWh) basis, in order to
compare this cost with the cost of electricity in general. 
<P>
For this purpose, we assume a cost of relying upon imported oil
of $2.56 per barrel of oil, based on the studies of Broadman and
Hogan. (Broadman and Hogan 1988; Broadman and Hogan 1986) Assuming
a heat rate of 10,000 for residual oil units on the NEPOOL margin,
this implies a cost of 0.4 cents/kWh.
<P>
In New England, for the high impact scenario, we assume that the
DSM avoids oil generation entirely, resulting in roughly $2.2
million for the costs of imported oil. For the low impact scenario,
we assume that DSM avoids energy on the NEPOOL margin (which is
96 percent oil), resulting roughly $2.1 million of federal subsidies.
<P>
<A Name = "2.10"></A><H2>2.10 Resource Depletion</H2>
<P>
The fossil and nuclear fuels used to generate electricity in New
England represent a finite energy resource. While fossil fuel
deposits appear to be plentiful and inexpensive in the short-term,
the time is approaching when these fuels may become economically
scarce, and society will be forced to switch to higher-cost energy
alternatives. Given the importance of fossil fuels to nearly all
aspects of our economy, these costs could be enormous. In addition,
there may be no viable substitutes for fossil fuels in some applications,
resulting in even higher costs to society. 
<P>
The predominant school of thought regarding resource depletion
is the <I>neoclassical</I> approach, which affirms that technological
progress stemming from human ingenuity will overcome any imminent
resource scarcity. The price of a resource is assumed to comprise
two components: a marginal cost reflecting the cost of exploration,
extraction and production, and a societal cost representing depletion.
Thus, in the neoclassical model, the increasing price of a natural
resource, such as oil or gas, that is growing scarce triggers
mechanisms that serve to augment the resource base: increased
exploration, recycling, substitution, as well as technological
innovation.
<P>
There are, however, several reasons why the short-term market
price non-renewable energy resources may not include the societal
cost component associated with depletion: i) markets do not operate
with perfect efficiency; ii) there is never perfect information
regarding the resource base; iii) the price of a resource is often
affected by extraneous factors such as political incentives, international
agreements, and collusion; and iv) resource production is often
influenced by short-term political action which may expedite resource
depletion, as seen in the Russian oil industry. 
<P>
The neoclassical model is sharply contrasted by the <I>biophysical</I>
approach to resource scarcity, which accounts explicitly for the
use of low-entropy energy and matter in both the energy resource
production process and in the economy as a whole. The biophysical
model regards high-quality energy and matter, which are elements
of natural capital, as the fundamental constituents of the labor,
capital and technological progress that drive our economy. The
<I>energy-return-on-investment</I> (EROI) index (the ratio of
the energy embodied in resources to the direct and indirect energy
input required to extract and refine them) used in the biophysical
model shows signs of depletion for oil and gas. 
<P>
The biophysical model to resource scarcity appears more consistent
with the goals of <I>sustainable development</I> and <I>intergenerational
equity</I>. Sustainable development strives to ensure that subsequent
generations have the same amount of natural capital (fuels, species
diversity, waste assimilation through the Earth's biogeochemical
cycles, etc.) at their disposal as previous ones. Intergenerational
equity promotes the equal treatment of all generations. 
<P>
The assignment of a monetary value to the costs of resource depletion
requires a number of assumptions and inputs, many of which are
clouded by uncertainty and imperfect information. These inputs
range from estimates of current reserves and undiscovered reserves
to the costs of technological change, and from the future demand
for resources to the appropriate discount rate. While there is
a vast body of literature on the subject of resource depletion,
there have been few studies that have determined the monetary
value of the costs of resource depletion for nuclear or fossil
fuels. One such study, by Hohmeyer, advocates penalizing the extraction
of fossil fuels by imposing a <I>reinvestment surcharge</I>, that
is explicitly included in the market price. Hohmeyer's methodology,
while requiring several estimates of future quantities which are
open to debate, is certainly consistent with the aims of sustainable
development and intergenerational equity. 
<P>
While the depletion of oil causes concern in today's society,
electricity production is only of secondary importance in this
issue, since it is responsible for only 4 percent of U.S. oil
consumption. Furthermore, most of the oil that is burned in power
generation is residual oil, which is a by-product of oil production.
However, if environmental sustainability policies begin to influence
oil consumption over the medium-term, electricity (and residual
oil) consumption may assume a more prominent role in the depletion
and the long-term costs of oil. Consequently, the resource depletion
costs of oil-fired electricity are likely to be low in the short-term,
but more pronounced in the long-term.
<P>
Coal is a major fuel for electric utilities in U.S., with electric
utilities consuming a very significant portion of U.S. coal (86%).
Consequently, reduction of electricity use may have a very significant
impact on coal production and eventually on coal depletion. However,
U.S. coal reserves are relatively plentiful. The current reserves-to-production
ratio, based on the Department of Energy estimates of recoverable
reserves, exceeds 150 years. Consequently, the depletion costs
of coal-fired electricity are likely to be low in the short-term,
but from a long-term sustainability perspective, coal depletion
could have a significant environmental externality cost associated
with it.
<P>
Natural gas also plays an important role in power generation.
Power generators, including independent producers, were responsible
for 14% of all natural gas consumed in the U.S. in 1992. The Department
of Energy projects that in 2010, power generation will be responsible
for over 20 percent of gas use in the U.S., given the increasing
reliance being placed upon gas. The natural gas industry currently
operates at a reserves-to-production ratio of 9 years. Although
U.S. gas reserves are significant, the National Petroleum Council
projects that by 2010, the gas industry will operate at a reserves-to-production
ratio of about 7 years. As a result, the costs associated with
natural gas depletion could be significant, both in the short-term
and long-term.
<A Name = "2.11"></A><H2>2.11 Benefits to Low-Income Customers</H2>
<P>
DSM programs targeted to low-income customers
in New England offer a variety of societal benefits to those customers
and the community in general. DSM programs can improve the amenities
and comforts available to low-income customers, because such customers
are often unable to afford the full amount of electricity services,
and their electricity service is sometimes disconnected due to
inability to pay their bills. Some of the benefits of low-income
DSM programs include the following:
<UL>
<LI>Reduced health impacts, ranging from the common cold to mortality
caused by hypothermia, as a result of customers being able to
properly heat their living spaces. (Brockway 1993a) 
<LI>Reduced dangers of fires and hazardous fumes from alternative
heating sources such as stoves and electric heaters. (Colton 1993)<SUP><A HREF = "#FN18">18</A></SUP>
<LI>Reduced forced mobility and homelessness, as a result of customers
being more able to make payments for rent and mortgages. (Brockway
1993b; Colton 1993)
<LI>Customers are more able to afford expenditures which improve
the quality of their health, such as better nutrition and preventive
health measures. (Cambridge Systematics 1994b)
<LI>Support for, and cooperation with, other low-income services
such as fuel assistance and Community Action Programs.
<LI>A host of less tangible benefits, such as improved goodwill
between the customers and the utility, and improved self-esteem
of low-income households. (Brockway 1993b) 
</UL>
<P>
A few studies have evaluated the extent to which particular low-income
DSM programs result in some of the benefits described above. For
example, a study of the U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization
Assistance Program found that the program provided safety repairs
to heating systems in seven percent of the homes, as well as additional
safety repairs (e.g., carbon monoxide tests, window and door locks,
smoke detectors) in 27 percent of the homes. (Oak Ridge 1993)
The same study found that the Weatherization Assistance Program
(which reached 198,000 dwellings) prevented at least 4,000 forced
changes in occupancy in its first year. (Oak Ridge 1993) As another
example, a survey of participants in low-income DSM programs in
New York found that the participants had lower rates of colds,
influenza or bronchitis, and reported a much lower rate of heating
with the stove or oven.
<P>
The recent Oak Ridge study is the only effort we have seen to
attempt to place a dollar value on the non-energy benefits of
low-income DSM programs described above. The authors found that,
despite a good deal of anecdotal evidence of the non-energy benefits,
there was little evidence to support the assignment of dollar
values to the benefits.
<P>
Nevertheless, the literature indicates that non-energy benefits
of low-income customers do exist. In addition, public utility
commissions in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York and Texas
have acknowledged that such benefits exist. The Texas Public Service
Commission has explicitly allowed utilities to implement low-income
DSM programs that exceed the Total Resource Cost Test, on the
basis of the non-energy benefits. However, the Commission has
not specified by <I>how much</I> the utilities should be able
to exceed the test.
<P>
We recommend that the non-energy benefits of low-income DSM programs
be accounted for by applying an adder of 10 percent to the avoided
cost (i.e., the cost savings) of each program. Such an adder is
justified because it is clear that non-price benefits of DSM programs
do exist and are significant, even if they have not yet been adequately
monetized. Obviously, such an adder is approximate, but we believe
that it is the most appropriate number available at this time.
Using a rough adder offers the advantages of being easily applicable,
of scaling with the size of the DSM program, and of providing
New England utilities with an important planning benchmark.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN19">19</A></SUP>
<P>
In order to make an illustrative calculation of the potential
impacts of the low-income DSM adder, we assume an avoided cost
of roughly 3 cents/kWh in New England. The hypothetical 100 MW
of DSM would result in 525 GWh of energy savings, which would
result in avoided cost savings of roughly $16,125,000 per year.
For our low and high impact scenarios, we assume that low-income
DSM program savings represent 1 percent and 10 percent of total
DSM program savings, respectively.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN20">20</A></SUP> The 10 percent
adder would then represent roughly $16,125 in additional benefits
in the low impact scenario, and roughly $161,250 in additional
benefits in the high impact scenario.
<A Name = "2.12"></A><H2>2.12 The Costs Associated with Outstanding Bills</H2>
<P>
DSM programs can also enable a utility to reduce costs associated
with outstanding electric bills. By reducing the cost of electricity
service, and by improving customer payment practices, DSM programs
can increase some customer's ability to make timely payments on
their monthly bills.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN21">21</A></SUP> As a result, the utility can
reduce a variety of costs associated with payment-troubled customers,
including: the lost time value of money associated with arrears,
credit and collection expenses, bad debt, the costs of implementing
payment plans, and regulatory expenses associated with payment-troubled
customers. (Colton 1993)
<P>
A number of studies have estimated the ability of DSM programs
to reduce customer arrears, usually by monitoring the results
of actual low-income DSM programs. These studies have shown that
DSM programs can reduce customer arrears by anywhere from $3 to
$176 per customer, with most studies showing savings on the order
of $30-$40 per customer, depending upon the DSM program and the
customer's payment history.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN22">22</A></SUP> In addition, two studies
have indicated that the variable costs associated with credit
and collection expenses are approximately $68 to $85 per customer.
(Colton 1994b and Central Maine Power 1993)
<P>
Some public service commissions (e.g., Texas) have found that
DSM programs can reduce the costs of outstanding electric bills,
and that utilities should therefore account for this benefit of
low-income DSM programs. However, we do not know of any commission
that has required utilities to quantify the extent of this benefit.
<P>
The magnitude of costs associated with outstanding bills can be
significant. For example, in 1990 for BECo:
<UL>
<LI>average bills that were 60 days or more in arrears amounted
to roughly $31.6 million. 
<LI>The total number of customers given a termination notice was
533,392. 
<LI>The total number that actually were terminated was 12,388
-- roughly two percent of all residential customers. 
<LI>Total residential charges to bad debt was roughly $8.8 million
(NARUC 1992). 
</UL>
<P>
The literature indicates that well-designed DSM programs can help
utilities to reduce some of the costs of outstanding bills. Therefore,
we recommend that a 5 percent adder be included with the benefits
of low-income programs, as an approximation of the savings from
reducing the costs of outstanding bills. Obviously, such an adder
is approximate, but we believe that it is the most appropriate
number available at this time. Using a rough adder offers the
advantages of being easily applicable, of scaling with the size
of the DSM program, and of providing New England utilities with
an important planning benchmark.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN23">23</A></SUP>
<P>
In order to make an illustrative calculation of the potential
impacts of the 5 percent adder, we assume an avoided cost of roughly
3 cents/kWh in New England. The hypothetical 100 MW of DSM would
result in 525 GWh of energy savings, which would result in avoided
cost savings of roughly $16,125,000 per year. For our low and
high impact scenarios, we assume that low-income DSM program savings
represent 1 percent and 10 percent of total DSM program savings,
respectively. The 5 percent adder would then represent roughly
$9,675 of additional benefits in the low impact scenario, and
roughly $96,750 of additional benefits in the high impact scenario.
<P>
<A Name = "2.13"></A><H2>2.13 DSM Spillover and Market Transformation</H2>
<P>
DSM can sometimes result in &quot;spillover&quot; effects, i.e.,
impacts beyond just the specific end-uses targeted and the particular
program participants. Spillover effects can occur in three ways:
(a) when participants adopt non-program DSM measures, (b) when
non-participants adopt program measures, and (c) when non-participants
adopt non-program measures. In addition, some DSM programs result
in &quot;market transformation,&quot; where the commercialization
and market adoption of energy efficiency equipment and practices
are advanced to the point where they reach non-participants, and
even other service territories. (Cambridge Systematics 1994a)
<P>
DSM programs specifically designed to promote market transformation
have received increased interest lately, in part because they
may be more appealing to utilities if they are exposed to increased
retail competition. Market transformation programs may be seen
as a relatively low-cost way of providing customer services, and
may enable utilities to move away from customer-specific programs
to those that are based on a more comprehensive market approach.
(Feldman 1994; Kitchin 1993)
<P>
In general, spillover effects can be seen as the opposite of the
free-rider effect (i.e., when a customer benefits from a DSM program,
even though he or she would have adopted the efficiency measure
without the program). It has become general practice for utilities
to subtract the savings associated with free-riders from their
DSM program estimates, but not the costs. In the same way, it
is appropriate for utilities to add the savings associated with
spillover effects.
<P>
Until recently, there has been little attention paid to estimating
the magnitude of spillover effects from different DSM programs.
(Cambridge Systematics 1994a) It is difficult to generalize about
the magnitude of spillover effects, because they will be highly
dependent upon the specific DSM program, the specific end-use
measure, and even the particular market conditions in the utility's
service territory and surrounding regions. 
<P>
Nevertheless, given the size of the New England service territory
and the extent of its DSM programs, some of these programs are
likely to result in some level of spillover effects. Market transformation
impacts are likely to be the most significant type of spillover
effects, because they tend to be long-lasting and to affect more
than specific participating or non-participating customers. Accordingly,
we recommend that all DSM programs that are expected to transform
the market for energy efficiency products or services be credited
with a 20 percent adder to its energy (kWh) and capacity (KW)
savings. For example, this credit could be applied to Residential
and Commercial/Industrial New Construction programs.
<P>
Obviously, such an adder is approximate, but we believe that it
is the most appropriate number available at this time. The 20
percent adder should also be seen as a minimum planning <I>objective</I>.
In other words, because of the many benefits of market transformation
programs, utilities should be designing their programs with the
<I>intent of achieving</I> market transformation. The literature
on this subject suggests that well-designed market transformation
programs should be able to achieve at least an additional 20 percent
of typical DSM savings.
<P>
In order to make an illustrative calculation of the potential
impacts of the 20 percent adder, we assume an avoided cost of
roughly 3 cents/kWh. The hypothetical 100 MW of DSM would result
in 525 GWh of energy savings, which would result in avoided cost
savings of roughly $16,125,000 per year. For our low and high
impact scenarios, we assume that market transformation DSM program
savings represent 12 percent and 50 percent of total DSM program
savings, respectively.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN24">24</A></SUP> The 20 percent adder would
then represent roughly $387,000 and roughly $1,612,500 of additional
benefits in the low and impact scenarios, respectively. 
<A Name = "2.14"></A><H2>2.14 Additional Benefits of DSM</H2>
<P>
DSM can often provide benefits to participating customers, beyond
those associated with reduced electricity bills. These benefits,
are often referred to as &quot;non-energy&quot; benefits, include,
for example, 
<UL>
<LI>reduced water and sewer bills as a result of measures to reduce
electric water heater consumption;

<P>
In 1988, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities ruled
that in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of DSM resources, utilities
should include &quot;any known, quantifiable, and significant
end-user benefits... resulting from the installation of a particular
demand-side option.&quot;<SUP><A HREF = "#FN25">25</A></SUP> 
<P>
Commonwealth Electric Company (ComElectric) recently applied this
concept in a request for proposals (RFP) to purchase DSM resources
from Energy Service Companies and customers. The RFP allowed sellers
of DSM to identify non-energy benefits that could be used in ranking
the different proposals. ComElectric received proposals which
claimed several types of non-energy benefits. At the time of drafting
this study the proposals from the energy service companies were
considered confidential, and are therefore unavailable.
<P>
The &quot;value tests&quot; proposed in the last few years by
Benjamin Hobbs (1991), Barakat &amp; Chamberlain (Chamberlain
et. al. 1993) and others expand the traditional &quot;total resource
cost&quot; approach to cost-benefit analysis of DSM. These tests
attempt to include impacts of DSM upon participants through estimates
of changes in consumer surplus. Thus, for example, if after the
installation of a DSM measure, the participant consumes more &quot;energy
service&quot;, there may be an increase in welfare to the customer.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN26">26</A></SUP>
<P>
DSM programs can also have direct environmental and health benefits
beyond the environmental impacts of avoided electricity generation.
For example, a Tellus study for the Electric Power Research Institute
found that utility-sponsored replacement of old fluorescent light
ballasts is likely to provide net environmental benefits because
the PCBs in the old ballasts are more likely to be handled properly
by an organized program than if left to the normal replacement
cycle. Similarly, refrigerator replacement in a DSM program can
include a systematic means of capturing CFCs in the refrigerant
and perhaps even the foam that might otherwise be released to
the atmosphere. (Tellus 1992)
<P>
The non-energy and direct environmental benefits of DSM will be
measure-specific, and also customer specific. In addition, the
literature on the subject is quite limited. Therefore, it is difficult
to even make an illustrative estimate of the potential impact
of New England DSM. The best way to quantify these benefits would
be to follow Commonwealth Electric's example of requiring Energy
Service Companies to develop quantitative estimates as a part
of their DSM program proposals.<P>

<A Name = "3.0"></A><H1>3. SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</H1>
<P>
The research summarized in the previous chapter leads us to certain
specific conclusions and recommendations for evaluating the non-price
benefits of DSM programs in New England. In this chapter, we will
discuss the inferences from our analysis for valuation methodology
as well as the potential benefits from DSM under low/high impact
scenarios. In the last section, we offer recommendations for future
research priorities.
<A Name = "3.1"></A><H2>3.1 Valuation Methodology for Monetizing Non-Price Factors</H2>
<P>
Table 3.1 presents a broad summary of the information available,
the methods used, and the range of results for monetizing non-price
factors. The first column describes the extent to which the particular
impact of interest can be <I>quantified</I>. For example, it is
relatively easy to quantify the amount of NO<SUB>x</SUB> that
is emitted from power plants, as well as the environmental impacts
of those emissions in terms of increased acid rain or ground-level
ozone. Therefore, we indicate that the &quot;quantification information&quot;
for NO<SUB>x</SUB> is &quot;good.&quot; For other pollutants,
such as lead, the amount of emissions from power plants are less
well understood at this time, but the potential impacts on human
health are relatively well understood; so lead is rated as &quot;fair.&quot;
<P>

</Center>
<P>
The second column in Table 3.1 presents the methods that are applied
to monetize, or otherwise account for, the impact of each non-price
factor. For some factors (e.g., air pollutants), economic approaches
such as &quot;regulator's revealed preferences&quot; are used.
For other non-price factors (e.g., radiological impacts), damage
costs are used, based on quantified environmental and health impacts.
Some factors (e.g., low-income DSM benefits) could be accounted
for using approximate &quot;adders,&quot; which are based on our
review of DSM analyses provided in the literature that we reviewed.
<P>
The third column of Table 3.1 presents our conclusions regarding
the current ability to monetize the costs or benefits of each
non-price factor. For example, for certain criteria air pollutants
it is relatively easy to quantify their environmental impacts,
and to identify their costs based on regulator's revealed preferences.
Therefore, we conclude that the &quot;monetization ability&quot;
is &quot;good&quot; for such pollutants. On the other hand, for
other non-price factors (e.g., the benefits of low-income DSM),
monetary estimates have not been developed in much depth. We conclude
that, at present, such factors have &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;
monetization ability.
<P>
The fourth column in Table 3.1 presents
the range of monetary values (in c/kWh) of each non-price factor,
where appropriate. The values presented are based on the costs
associated with the relevant type of resource. For example, the
monetary values for criteria air pollutants are based on marginal
emissions from NEPOOL; the values for heavy metals are based on
emissions from coal plants; and the values of radiological impacts
are based on nuclear plants.
<P>
In a few cases, it may not be possible or appropriate to account
for non-price factors in monetary terms. For example, the benefits
of low-income DSM have been clearly demonstrated in the literature;
however, there has been little success in quantifying those benefits
in monetary terms. Therefore, we propose that for such non-price
factors a simple percentage adder to the direct avoided cost benefits
of the programs be applied. These recommendations are summarized
in the fifth column in Table 3.1.
<P>
Finally, the last column in Table 3.1 describes what <I>type</I>
of benefit or cost the particular non-price factor represents.
For example, environmental impacts (e.g., radiological impacts)
are considered externalities which can be directly added to the
total resource cost of a particular electricity resource. Other
impacts (e.g., job creation) may not technically be an externality
which can be added to the total resource costs, but may be considered
anyway as an important &quot;policy factor.&quot; Other factors
(e.g., spillover effects of DSM) represent utility savings, and
can be accounted for similarly to traditional utility savings.
<P>
The results in Table 3.1 indicate that criteria air pollutants
and greenhouse gases represent the largest costs, out of all the
costs that were monetized. Heavy metals can alias have a significant
cost, depending upon the source of generation. The costs associated
with radiological impacts span an enormous range, and are quite
uncertain at this time. Monetary values for land, water and transmission
and distribution were not available from the literature that we
reviewed, although the impacts can be potentially large. Monetary
values were also not available for the benefits of low-income
DSM, the benefits relating to outstanding bills, and DSM spillover
effects; however, we recommend that approximate percentage adders
be used to account for these benefits when evaluating resource
options.
<A Name = "3.2"></A><H2>3.2 Illustration of Potential Impacts of DSM Savings</H2>
<P>
The results of our analysis suggest that the non-price benefits
of DSM currently unaccounted for in the planning process can be
quite large. On the basis of the research summarized in the previous
chapter, we estimate that the lower and upper bound of the total
annual non-priced of these programs benefits (excluding nuclear)
are $19 million and $45 million, respectively. as shown in Figure
3.1. The basis for these results are explained further by Table
3.2 which presents illustrative calculations of the potential
impacts of each non-price factor, in monetary terms, of 100 MW
of DSM savings on the NEPOOL system. This indicates the potential
magnitude of the societal benefits of each non-price factor, under
low impact and high impact scenarios.
<P>
The actual costs and benefits of each
non-price factor will depend not only upon the monetary values
assigned to them, but also to the specific type and design of
DSM program and the particular supply-side resource that the program
displaces. Performing such calculations for specific DSM programs
and supply-side resources is beyond the scope of this study. However,
it is nonetheless informative to estimate the costs and benefits
based on generic DSM programs and generic supply-side resources,
using as much NEPOOL information as is readily available. As a
result, the impacts presented in Table 3.2 should not be seen
as definitive estimates of costs and benefits to New England utilities,
but rather as approximations to illustrate the range of potential
impacts.
<P>

<A HREF = "tab32.gif"><IMG ALT="Table 3.1" SRC ="tab32sm.gif"><P>

</Center>
<P>
For our low impact scenario, we simply assume that the DSM savings
avoids the likely supply-side resource which would have the lowest
impact for each particular non-price factor. For example, for
criteria air pollutants, DSM that avoids generation and capacity
from new natural gas combined cycle units will have relatively
low benefits, because gas units emit relatively low amounts of
such pollutants.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN27">27</A></SUP>
<P>
For our high impact scenario, we simply assume that the DSM savings
avoids the likely supply-side resource which would have the highest
impact for each particular non-price factor. In this case, for
radiological impacts we assume that the DSM savings avoid capacity
and generation from a nuclear plant, because this obviously would
result in the greatest benefits. Similarly, for heavy metals we
assume that the DSM savings avoid generation from a coal plant,
because coal plants emit the most significant levels of heavy
metal pollutants.<P>
<Center>
<H3>Figure 3.1: Breakdown of societal benefits associated with
New England's DSM programs under low and high impact scenarios</H3>
<IMG ALT="Figure 3.1" SRC ="fig31.gif">
</Center>
<P>
Table 3.2 demonstrates that reductions in criteria air pollutants
through our hypothetical DSM could result in savings of roughly
$7 to $17 million. Reductions in heavy metals could result in
savings of roughly $0.3 to $1.5 million. The estimated savings
from avoiding radiological impacts are dominated by the costs
associated with unstabilized uranium mill tailings piles. Table
3.2 also demonstrates that our recommended percentage adders for
low-income DSM, benefits relating to outstanding bills, and DSM
spillover will not necessarily be large relative to other externalities,
but may nonetheless be important relative to the size of the specific
DSM program budgets. These recommended DSM adders may be more
important for the messages that they send to utility planners,
rather than the actual amount of money involved.
<P>
Actual DSM savings are likely to have impacts somewhere between
the low and high scenarios that we present. More specific and
focused estimates of the potential impacts should be determined
through more detailed future studies. In addition, since different
avoided resources are used to calculate the impact of each group
of non-price factors, these results should not be added across
different non-price factors.
<A Name = "3.3"></A><H2>3.3 Recommended Research Priorities</H2>
<P>
In the following list, we summarize the basis for each of these
research recommendations.
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gases</B>: Given
that much of the information necessary to monetize these impacts
is already available, we recommend a low<B> </B>research priority.
<P><LI><B>Heavy Metals</B>: While additional research could significantly
reduce the uncertainty associated with current estimates of monetary
impacts of heavy metals. We conclude that reduced uncertainty
about the monetary impacts of heavy metals may not have a significant
impact on DSM planning in the short-term.<SUP><A HREF = "#FN28">28</A></SUP> Therefore,
we recommend a low to medium research priority
<P><LI><B>Water Use Impacts</B>: We recommend a medium to high research
priority because the environmental costs could be significant,
and the research necessary to monetize the impacts is relatively
low.
<P><LI><B>Land Use Impacts</B>: We recommend a high<B> </B>research
priority because of the lack of research into this area.
<P><LI><B>Radiological Impacts of Nuclear Power</B>: We recommend
a high research priority for the uranium fuel supply, the risk
of nuclear accident, and the costs of waste disposal. These costs
are not yet fully understood, and could have important impacts
on electricity planning in general. Future research regarding
the emissions from routine reactor operations and decommissioning
should have a medium priority.
<P><LI><B>Electricity Transmission and Distribution</B>: We recommend
a high<B> </B>research priority because very little research has
been done to date, and additional research can resolve some issues
which may have significant implications for electricity planning
in general.
<P><LI><B>Job Creation and Economic Development</B>: Given the public
policy implications of DSM employment impacts, and the size of
New England's investments in DSM, we believe that further research
in this area should be given a medium priority. We do not recommend
a high priority primarily because employment impacts are not necessarily
an externality. On the other hand, it is important to more fully
understand the general economic development benefits that DSM
offers by lowering energy costs to businesses and households.
<P><LI><B>Government Subsidies for Energy Resources</B>: We recommend
a low<B> </B>research priority, primarily because subsidies are
not an externality, and DSM programs are unlikely to have a significant
effect on federal energy subsidies.
<P><LI><B>The Costs of Relying Upon Imported Oil</B>: We recommend
a medium<B> </B>research priority because a significant portion
of New England's fuel mix. We also recommend that the risks associated
with reliance on foreign oil be appropriately addressed in utilities'
planning models.
<P><LI><B>Resource Depletion</B>: Despite the fact that there are
few, if any, signs of fossil fuel scarcity in the short-term,
we recommend that New England utilities consider the possible
future effects of oil and gas depletion. Regional utilities can
act by implementing an aggressive DSM regimen, promoting supply-side
energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy research
and development. Further research should focus on applying Hohmeyer's
sustainability initiative to the U.S., and on obtaining improved
oil and gas reserve estimates. 
<P><LI><B>Benefits to Low-Income Customers</B>: While there currently
exists a significant amount of research regarding the existence
of low-income DSM benefits, there is very little information available
to develop monetary values of these benefits. Therefore, more
research is warranted on this important topic. On the other hand,
many of the low-income benefits could be represented with the
10 percent adder to avoided costs. Therefore, we recommend that
this topic receive a medium research priority. 
<P><LI><B>The Costs Associated with Outstanding Bills</B>: Because
of the potential reductions in costs to utilities, more research
is warranted on this topic. On the other hand, many of the benefits
could be represented with the 5 percent adder to avoided costs.
Therefore, we recommend that this topic receive a medium<B> </B>research
priority.
<P><LI><B>DSM Spillover and Market Transformation</B>: Given the
potential magnitude of additional savings available from spillover
effects, we recommend that this topic be given a high research
priority. There are currently a number of studies (in Massachusetts,
California, Wisconsin, and nationally) being undertaken to address
the potential magnitude of DSM spillover effects.
<P><LI><B>Additional Benefits of DSM</B>: The non-energy and direct
environmental impacts of DSM programs could provide significant
benefits to New England utilities and their customers. However,
we recommend that this topic area be given a relatively low research
priority, because of the potential for utilizing Energy Service
Companies to conduct customer-specific and measure-specific estimates.
</UL>
<P>
Beyond these <I>research </I>priorities<I>, </I>we note that the
continued implementation of DSM programs by New England Utilities
should be a <I>policy </I>priority. In considering various proposals
for restructuring the electric industry in New England, it will
be important to keep in view the full range of non-price benefits,
environmental. economic, and societal, that are associated with
energy efficiency.
