<B><CENTER> SUMMARY OF ADMINISTRATION, HOUSE, AND SENATE IDEA PROVISIONS ON MAJOR ISSUES WITH CEC POSITION</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<U>Provisions</U>
<U>Various Positions</U>
Federal Commitment
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The Administration's bill would eliminate provisions in the current IDEA that entitles States to funds equal to 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for every child served under IDEA.  The funds are to help States meet the excess costs of educating a child with a disability.<P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House draft bill would also eliminate these provisions.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate retains the current IDEA language.<P>
<B>CEC position</B>: Although the current Federal funds to States equals only 8 percent of the APPE, CEC strongly supports retaining the original 40 percent commitment encased in IDEA.  IDEA is meant to be a partnership between the Federal government and the States to educate children with disabilities.  This commitment to the States must continue.   
State Formula
<B>Administration's bill</B>: H.R. 1986 would ensure States receive an amount equal to the amount it received under FY 1995; for funds appropriated above the FY 1996 level, the current formula would change from one based on the number of children with disabilities served to a formula based on the population of children aged 3 through 21.   <P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House has released a draft bill that would institute a 10
year transition from a "head count" to a population-based formula (aged 3-21) with a factor for child poverty.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft bill would keep the current child count formula for grants to States.<P>
<B>CEC position</B>: CEC supports the current child count formula and opposes moving toward a population-based formula at this time.<BR>

Local Formula
<B>Administration's bill:</B> H.R. 1986 would change current law that requires States to make grants to LEAs based on the number of children with disabilities they serve, to allow States to make grants based on population, school enrollment, population of children receiving FAPE, allocations for previous fiscal years, any two or more of the previous factors, or poverty in combination with one or more of the other factors.<P>
<B>House draft bill</B>: Same as H.R. 1986. <P>
<B>Senate bill</B>: The Senate draft bill would keep the current child count formula for grants to LEAs.<P>
<B>CEC position</B>: CEC supports the current law that requires States to make grants to localities based on the number of children with disabilities served.<BR>

Eligibility
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would change the definition of "child with a disability" to a child who has a physical or mental impairment and who, by reason of that impairment, needs special education and related services.  The bill then defines physical or mental impairment to include the current disability categories.  The bill does, however, change "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."  The bill would continue to allow States the option of using "developmental delay" for children aged 3 through 5.<P>
<B>House draft bill: </B>The bill would keep current language on eligibility but would add "neurobiological brain disorder" to the categories included under the definition of "child with a disability."  The draft would also expand the option States now have to use developmental delay for children aged 3 through 5 to children aged 3 through 9.<P>
<B>Senate bill: </B>The Senate draft bill would keep the current categories of children with disabilities.  The bill would continue current provisions that allow States the option of using "developmental delay" for children aged 3 through 5.<P>
<B>CEC position:</B> CEC supports retaining the current categories and expanding the State's option to include using developmental delay for children aged 3 through 8.  CEC advocates for changing "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional or behavioral disorder."
<BR>
IEP Team
<BR>
<B>Administration's bill</B>: The bill would require at least one special education provider and at least one regular education teacher, who are, to the maximum extent feasible, individuals who interact with children with disabilities on a daily basis, to participate on the IEP team.<P>
<B>House draft bill</B>: The House draft should require at least one regular education teacher, if the child is or may be participating in the regular education environment, and a special educator or provider to participate in the IEP team.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft would require a special education provider as well as a regular educator if the student is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment.  The Senate draft would also require on the team an individual who is qualified to interpret the instructional implications of evaluation results.  This requirement may be filled by existing members of the team if they are qualified.<P>
<B>CEC Position</B>: CEC supports language that requires both a special education teacher and a regular education teacher to be a part of the IEP team. 
<BR>
IEP Components
<BR>
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would expand existing components required in the IEP and adds the following new components: a statement of any individual modification in the administration of State or district-wide assessments of student achievement, or if the child will not participate in a particular assessment, a statement of why and how that child will be assessed; and beginning at least one year before the child reaches the age of majority, a statement concerning the rights that will transfer to the child.  The bill would omit short-term objectives in the IEP.   <BR>
<B><BR>
House draft bill:</B> The House bill also expands existing components required in the IEP and includes the additional components called for in H.R. 1986.  The House also requires, where appropriate, a description of behavioral management and behavior modification techniques to be employed to help the child behave appropriately.  The draft bill would omit short-term objectives in the IEP.  <P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft language would expand existing requirements and include the following new components: a statement of the extent to which the child will participate with nondisabled children in the general curriculum, in the regular classroom and in extra-curricular and other non-academic activities; and participation in general assessments, including any needed modifications.  The IEP must also include how the child's parents will be regularly informed of the child's progress. For secondary-aged students the IEP must include transition provisions and, at least one year before the age of majority, a statement about the rights that will transfer to the student on reaching the age of majority.  The Senate bill would also omit short term objectives.  The Senate separates other concerns such as behavior management, language needs, communication needs, and braille literacy into a separate section of factors the IEP team should consider. <P>
<B>CEC Position:</B> CEC is concerned that in expanding requirements for the IEP, the bills would result in more burdensome paperwork for the classroom teacher and local administrators.  While CEC fully supports the need for an individualized written program, we understand that the more time spent in addressing different factors in the document, the less time the teacher has to teach or to plan lessons.  For this reason, we urge Congress to limit written requirements in the IEP while outlining additional factors to be considered in the development of the IEP.<P>

Flexibility and Waivers
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would allow States to use 25 percent of the amount allocated under the State grant program for State activities for a broader range of activities and without regard to the prohibition on commingling or supplanting of IDEA funds.  The Administration's bill would allow funds to be used for the costs of special education and related services provided in a regular class to a child with a disability in accordance with the child's IEP, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services.  The bill would also allow an LEA to use not more than 5 percent of funds to develop and implement a coordinated services system.    <P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House draft bill would allow States to use only 10 percent of the amount allocated under the State grant program for State activities for a broader range of activities.  The draft would eliminate the prohibition on commingling funds and allow waivers to the prohibition against supplanting funds if the Secretary determines that the State has provided clear evidence that all children with disabilities in the State have available a free appropriate public education (current law) or that such a waiver would allow the State to improve the delivery of special education and related services to children with disabilities in the State.  The bill would also allow an LEA to use not more than 5 percent of funds to develop and implement a coordinated services system.    <P>
The draft authorizes the Secretary to modify any requirement under Part B for 10 designated LEAs.  The House bill would also allow the Secretary to make "modifications" to requirements of Parts B and the early intervention program if a State has at least one LEA that has a demonstration project under the new part D program.  Finally, the House draft bill would include IDEA as one of the education programs whose funds can be commingled in a "school-wide project" allowed under Title I of the ESEA.<P>
The House bill includes similar provisions allowing for incidental benefit for nondisabled children.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate bill would continue to allow States to use 25 percent of their funds for State activities. The Senate bill also expands the activities States are allowed to fund.  The draft keeps the current prohibition on commingling of funds and current language governing waivers.  The bill authorizes LEAs to use funds to permit individual schools to design, implement and evaluate "school-based improvement plans."  It  is unclear whether participation in the school improvement program will result in the allowance for waivers.  The bill allows LEAs to use an undetermined (as of the current draft) of funds for a coordinated system.<P>
Similar to the House and the Administration, the Senate draft includes language allowing for incidental benefit to nondisabled children and children covered under ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. <BR>
<B><BR>
CEC position:</B> CEC opposes allowing funds to be used without regard to the prohibition on commingling or supplanting funds.  States should use IDEA funds for activities that improve the State's capacity to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities.  CEC is also strongly opposed to any additional waivers of requirements in IDEA.  Current requirements are important to ensuring educational services to children with disabilities and should not be able to be waived.  Finally, CEC opposes provisions that seem to shift the burden of coordinated services to IDEA rather than to share specified funding for coordinated services across all education programs.  <P>
CEC supports the incidental benefit language that permits children without disabilities and children covered under ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to benefit from services provided to children with disabilities.  
Consolidation of Special Purposes Programs
<B>Administration's bill:</B> For FY 1997, the bill would consolidate the 14 categorical programs funded under Parts C through G of IDEA into 5 new authorities: State Improvement Grants (50 percent of funds for professional development), Professional Development, Research to Practice, Parent Training and Information, and Technology Development and Educational Media Services. <P>
For State Improvement Grants, States must receive at least $400,000 each.  If the total amount appropriated for Parts C through G is at least $254 million, the bill requires the following funding: at least $12.8 million to address the needs of children with deaf blindness: $4.2 million to address the needs of children with emotional disturbance; $10 million to address the needs of children with severe disabilities; and $4 million to address the postsecondary, vocational and adult education needs of individuals with deafness.   For the Parent Training and Information program, States must receive at least $150,000 or the amount that was allocated the previous fiscal year, whichever is greater.  For other existing IDEA authorities such as the clearinghouses, the RRCs, and research and technology, the bill allows the Secretary to expend funds but does not require the Secretary to do so.   <P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The draft bill would further consolidate the 14 programs into one new Part D.  Part D would have 3 subparts: Subpart I: General Provisions and National Activities; Subpart II: State Program Improvement Grants for Children with Disabilities (75 percent of funds for professional development); and Subpart III: Parent Training. <P>
The House draft bill does not require a minimum funding for State improvement grants.  The House draft includes the same minimum funding requirements for children who are deaf-blind and to address the postsecondary needs of individuals with deafness but does not have a floor for children who have a serious emotional disturbance or have severe disabilities.  The draft authorizes $135.6 million for Subpart I, has not released an authorization level for Subpart II and has an authorization level of $13.5 million for Subpart III.  The bill contains language similar to the Administration's bill that allows the Secretary to expend funds for other purposes but does not require it.   Unlike the Administration's bill, however, the House draft would eliminate any reference to the clearinghouses in language authorizing activities the Secretary may fund.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The bill would consolidate the discretionary programs into three main parts: Part C Promoting State Systems Change; Part D Research and Personnel Preparation; Part E Research and Technology Development.  Part C authorizes $30 million for competitive grants to States to support systems change initiatives.  The planning grant cannot exceed $100,000.  For the implementation grant, the minimum grant is $450,000.  For Part D, $56 million is authorized for research and demonstration grants and $81 million for personnel preparation.  Under Part E, there is $13.5 million authorized for parent training and information and $43.4 million for coordinated technical assistance and dissemination, including clearinghouse activities.  Finally, Part E authorizes $30 million for technology development and media activities.  The sum of the proposed authorizations equals the FY 1995 level of funding for current discretionary programs.  The Senate bill does not include the floors for specific categories of children who are included in the Administration's and the House's bill.      <P>
<B>CEC Position</B>: CEC believes that any consolidation of the special purposes programs needs to ensure that the original goals of the programs continue to be addressed.  CEC believes that guaranteed floors and earmarks need to be included for particular priority areas.  The criteria for any consolidation should be: prioritized need areas represented by the current statutory authorities should be maintained; programs with demonstrated effectiveness as they are currently structured should not be restructured; and the worthy objective of greater flexibility in addressing immediate and emerging needs should not take precedent over the obligation to earmark resources for populations and activities that would otherwise be neglected.  CEC is also very concerned that the three national clearinghouses continue to be specifically funded in order to develop and disseminate crucial information on the education of children with disabilities.  Furthermore, CEC is opposed to reducing the level of funding for the discretionary programs and urges inclusion of authorization figures which reflect the current fiscal commitment and allow for at least modest growth.      
Professional Development
<B>Administration's bill: </B>  H.R. 1986 would require each State to have in effect a Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD).  The bill would require the SEA to establish and maintain standards to ensure that personnel, including paraprofessional personnel, are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including standards that are consistent with any State-approved or State
recognized certification, licensing, registration or other comparable requirements that apply to the area in which they are providing services.  To the extent the standards are not based on the highest requirements in the State, the State must indicate the steps the State is taking to require the retraining or hiring of personnel that meet appropriate professional requirements in the State.   The Administration's bill requires 50 percent of funds under the State Improvement grants to be spent for professional development.<P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The House draft bill would eliminate the CSPD requirement in Part B.  The bill would specifically require the SEA to establish and maintain standards to ensure that personnel are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.  Like the current law, the standards must be consistent with any State
approved or State-recognized certification, licensing, or other comparable requirements that apply to the professional discipline.  To the extent the standards are not based on the highest requirement in the State, the State must specify the steps the State is taking to require retraining or hiring of personnel that meet the appropriate professional requirements in the State (same as in H.R. 1986 and in current law).  The House includes this exception: if, however, a State determines that there is a shortage of appropriate personnel, and the agency has taken steps to recruit and hire such personnel, the State may, subject to public comment and review, temporarily modify the standards for any agencies affected.  The bill also allows paraprofessionals who are appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, regulations, or written policy, to be used in the provision of special education and related services.  The draft bill requires 75 percent of funds under the State Improvement grants to be spent for professional development.  There are also authorized professional development activities allowed under Part D, Subpart I.<P>
<B>Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate draft would continue the requirement that States have a CSPD.  The bill would keep current language governing the "highest standard" provisions.  The Senate does not include the exceptions that the House does or paraprofessional language.  Personnel preparation continues to be funded under a new Part D that would address: personnel needs for children with high
incidence disabilities, leadership personnel, personnel for children with low
incidence disabilities; and projects of national significance. <P>
<B>CEC Position:</B> CEC opposes any removal of the requirement that each State has a CSPD.  We encourage a cautious and practical approach to the issue of improving in-State professional development capacity.  CEC is further concerned that any personnel development plan be developed through a process that promotes linkages among all involved State agencies, institutions, and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  Also,  CEC supports efforts to address the "highest standards" issue in IDEA and the assignment of responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the SEA.  We believe the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is important and would use the term "professional standards" throughout the highest standard provisions.  We do not believe a proposed highest standard exemption is necessary and oppose this amendment.  Finally, while the House draft language addressing paraprofessionals clarifies those who are qualified to provide services to children with disabilities, we believe this clarification should be made within a broader framework defining different levels of personnel within disciplines.   <BR>

Discipline<P>
<B>
Administration's bill:</B> The bill would replace the current "a firearm" with "a dangerous weapon," allowing any child with a disability that brings a dangerous weapon to school to be placed in an interim alternative educational setting (IAES) for not more than 45 days.  The bill also allows a hearing officer to order a change in the placement of a child with a disability to an IAES for not more than 45 days if the public agency demonstrated by substantial evidence that maintaining the child in his or her current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to self or to others.<P>
<B>House draft bill:</B> The bill would allow a hearing officer to place a child with a disability who brings a weapon or drugs to school, or has committed a violent act, or if the maintenance of the current placement is  substantially likely to result in injury to self or others, into an IAES for not more than 45 days.  Finally, the House would allow the cessation of educational services for a child with a disability whose behavior was not a manifestation of the disability.  If parents begin due process proceedings, the child will continue to receive educational services during proceedings.      <P>
<B>Senate draft language:</B> The Senate draft bill has much more extensive language that addresses the determination of manifestation, disruptive children, and children who have a disability but who have not yet been determined eligible for special education.<P>
For suspension of a child with a disability for longer than 10 school days, the Senate draft would require the IEP team to determine if the child's behavior was not a manifestation of the child's disability and if such policy is applied to all children who engage in the behavior.  If the behavior is found not to be a manifestation of the disability, the child may be disciplined in the same manner as other children; however, the child will continue to receive educational services unless the child was involved with dangerous weapons or drugs and the policy of the agency is to cease services to any child involved with dangerous weapons or drugs.   If the parents disagree with the determination, they may request an expedited due process hearing.  During the pendency of such procedures, the child shall continue to receive educational services.<P>
If a child with a disability has a dangerous weapon; engages in the illegal use, possession or distribution of drugs; or engages in behavior that results in or is substantially likely to engage in behavior that would result in serious bodily injury, the child may be placed in an IAES regardless of whether the behavior is a manifestation of the disability.  In order to place a child in an IAES within 10 days of when the behavior occurred or when the behavior became known to the principal, the principal, after consultation with individuals knowledgeable of the child's disability and the chair of the IEP team, and, if appropriate, the agency's director of special education, must determine in writing that the child engaged in the behavior.  The child's IEP team must then assess and identify modifications in the child's IEP that are necessary for placement in an IAES consistent with the provision of FAPE.  The placement of a child in an IAES must, to the maximum extent feasible, be made within these 10 school days.   In no case shall the placement of the child in the IAES occur later than 20 days.  If the principal's determination and the IEP team's actions do not occur within the time frame, the child's placement shall be the one described in the child's current IEP, unless the parents and the agency agree otherwise.<P>
If the parents disagree with the principal's determination, they can request an expedited hearing.  During the pendency of the due process proceedings, the child shall remain in the IAES, unless the parents and the agency agree otherwise. <P>
For a child with a disability who engages in ongoing serious disruptive behavior that significantly impairs the education of the child, the education of other children, or the ability of the child's teacher to teach, the child may be placed in an IAES if the principal, in consultation with individuals knowledgeable about the child's disability, the chair of the child's IEP team, and if appropriate, the  the agency's director of special education, determines in writing that the child's current placement would significantly impair the education of the child, the other children or the ability of the teacher to teach.  In order for the principal or a hearing officer to determine that the child is engaging in ongoing serious disruptive behavior, there must be a cumulative record over an extended period of time. The child's IEP team then develops a placement in an IAES consistent with FAPE.  If the child was disciplined for a period of up to 10 days, the principal's determination and the IEP team's actions shall occur within such time period, not to exceed 10 school days.  If the parents disagree with the determination, a hearing officer, within 10 school days of the child's parents communicating disagreement to the principal, shall rule on whether the placement of the child in an IAES was justified.  If the decision is not rendered within 10 school days, the child's placement shall be the one described in the child's IEP, unless the parents of the child and the agency agree otherwise.    <P>
A child who has not yet been determined eligible for special education may be eligible for the authorized protections if the agency had knowledge that the child has a disability before the behavior occurred.  The agency is considered to have knowledge of a child's disability if:  the child's parents expressed concern, in writing if practicable, to agency personnel about the child's behavior, including but not limited to a parental request for an evaluation; or the child's teacher, or other personnel expressed concern about the child's behavior to the agency's director of special education.  If the agency did not have knowledge of the child's disability, the child may be subject to the same disciplinary procedures as other children.<P>
<B>CEC Position:</B> CEC  believes that an IAES should be allowed for no more than 45 days for a child with a disability who is a "danger to self or others."  However, placement in the 45-day setting must, like any change of placement procedure used to move a child, be the least restrictive placement possible.  The IDEA requirement for FAPE must be upheld regardless of the setting in which the child is placed.  CEC believes that current law adequately addresses disruptive behavior from a child with a disability and oppose additional provisions which may have unintended negative consequences.  Further, CEC believes that no child should be permanently expelled from school.
<BR>
Procedural Safeguards
<B>Administration's bill:</B> The bill would require States to provide parents with the option of using mediation to resolve disputes.  The bill would also significantly expand requirements for parental notice.<P>
<B>House draft bill: </B>The House would also require States to provide parents with the option of using mediation but prohibits attorneys from attending; however, the House does allow the parent to bring a non-attorney representative.  Also, the mediation would not be considered part of administrative proceedings.  The House also would expand requirements for parental notice but would limit the number of times the agency has to send out information on procedural safeguards.  The draft bill also includes language stating that "a minor change of instructional strategies to carry out the IEP of the child shall not be considered to be a change requiring a notice to the parents...."<P>
<B>Senate draft bill</B>: The Senate draft would also require States to provide parents with the option of using mediation.  Unlike the House, however, the Senate bill would not prohibit attorneys from attending and does not state that mediation would not be considered part of administrative proceedings.   The Senate bill would also greatly expand parental notice requirements.<P>
<B>CEC position: </B>CEC has been at the forefront of calling for mediation to be included in IDEA.   CEC supports the House draft language that limits the number of times an agency has to send out the same information on procedural safeguards.  CEC also supports the House language that does not require parental notice for minor modifications to instructional strategies.   CEC is concerned, however, that all three of the proposed bills on reauthorization would result in more paperwork for schools and will continue to result in parents being overwhelmed by the length and amount of technical information included in the basic notice. 
Early Childhood
<B>Administration bill:</B> Continues authorization of the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council (FICC).  <B><P>
House draft bill: </B>The House draft would eliminate the FICC.<B><P>
Senate draft bill:</B> The Senate bill would continue authorization of the FICC.<B><P>
CEC Position:   </B>CEC continues to support the goals of the FICC, and urges that the requirement of an FICC be retained in the law.  Especially at a time when there is the prospect of further constraints on other federal resources available to assist in meeting the objectives of Part H, having an FICC to coordinate the collective federal effort becomes even more necessary. <B><BR>
