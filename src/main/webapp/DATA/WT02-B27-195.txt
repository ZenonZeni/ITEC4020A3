On this site, The Living Will &amp; Values History Project provides a free living will package that can be downloaded. Each package contains two sections that you can download separately:
<ul>
<li>AN ADVANCED LIVING WILL DOCUMENT. This living will is the result of much research by the the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland and The Living Will &amp; Values History Project, publishers of the first ever volume of Collected Living Wills from around the world. The document is the result of considerable research and wide consultation and avoids most of the pitfalls of many living wills, even those compiled by lawyers and legislators. It is suitable for use anywhere in the world, but if you live in the UNITED STATES we recommend that you also consider the state-specific legislation and documents which can be obtained directly from <a href="http://www.echonyc.com/~choice">Choice In Dying.</a> The use of a <a href="vh.html">values history is also strongly recommended.</a> Documents enabling you to authorise someone else to make decisions for you (known often as Durable Powers of Attorney for Health Care) are common in America. There is often a prescribed form. If you use one of these, we advise you to also employ a <a href="vh.html">values history</a> to help your proxy understand your wishes more fully. The values history section of the <i>Project's</i> document may also be useful to explain to your proxy how you would feel about specific medical scenarios. For DENMARK, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, NETHERLANDS we also recommend you to obtain local advice.
<BR><BR>
<li>A GUIDANCE SHEET to help you customize your living will.
</ul>

<BR><BR>
<font=-1>Please note that the original document is on high quality, distinctively coloured paper and opens out as a single sheet ready for filing with the medical records. We also recommend the use of stickers or distinctive markers on the medical file to draw attention to the existence of a living will, and a card carried on the person to indicate its location. If you wish, you can order a <a href="books.html#lw">pack</a> that contains all these items together with a carrying wallet and 32-page guidance booklet.</font>
<P>
The Living Will &amp; Values History Project is a not-for-profit organization and we rely on the generosity of our members and contributors to provide this service. Please visit our <a href="new_app.htm">membership page</a> to learn how you can support the organization.
