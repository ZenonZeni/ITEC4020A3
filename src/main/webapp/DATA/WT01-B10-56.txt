<h1 align=center><i>Introducing the GIFT Procedure</i></h1><hr>


GIFT is an advanced fertility  technique developed in 1984 by Dr. Ricardo Asch and his associates at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas.  The name is an acronym, Gamete Intra-Fallopian Transfer.  This name summarizes the procedure quite well.<p>

   Male gametes (sperm) and female gametes (ova or eggs) are placed separately into a special catheter and then injected into the woman's fallopian tube during an outpatient surgical procedure called <a href="laprscpy.html">laparoscopy</a>.  In contrast to <a href="ivf2col.html">In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</a> where eggs are fertilized outside of the body in a laboratory and then placed into the uterus, the GIFT procedure allows fertilization and pre-embryo implantation to occur just as it does during naturally occurring pregnancy.  <p>

<b>How it works</b> <br>

   In order to increase the chances of recovering several healthy and mature eggs, and to prepare a proper uterine environment for pre-embryo implantation, the woman will undergo about two to three weeks of intensive preparation.  This includes therapy with hormones commonly called "fertility drugs."  Blood tests and ultrasound scans of the ovary are used to determine the optimal timing for egg retrieval.  <p>

   When the ideal time arrives, the wife  is admitted to the hospital to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure (laparoscopy) to recover the eggs.  The GIFT procedure may be combined with other laparoscopic procedures, such as diagnostic laparoscopy or treatment of <a href="endoassn.html">endometriosis</a>.
<p>
   During the laparoscopy procedure, a small incision is made in the area of the umbilicus (navel), and a telescope-like instrument (laparoscope)  is inserted and used to view the ovaries and other pelvic organs.  The ovarian follicles, which contain the mature eggs, can then be located.  Using a special needle, the fluid inside each follicle is aspirated (suctioned out).  The embryologist uses a powerful microscope to examine the fluid and determine whether an egg was present.  He then selects a few mature eggs (best) and mixes them with sperm for transfer into the fallopian tube. <p>

   Occasionally, ultrasound will be used to retrieve the eggs directly through the vaginal wall.  Ultrasound guided transvaginal egg retrieval is performed using local anesthesia.  If mature eggs are obtained, general anesthesia will be administered and laparoscopy will be performed.  <p>

   Before surgery, the husband provides a semen sample. The sperm sample is prepared for placement in the fallopian tube.  At surgery the eggs (up to four of them) are loaded into a special catheter containing the sperm.  Normally, fertilization will take place later in the fallopian tube.  Usually eggs and sperm are injected into only one fallopian tube.  Therefore, only one healthy fallopian tube and one ovary are required for GIFT.  <p>

   Recovery is quick and usually the woman goes home the same day.  Activity is limited for 48 hours following surgery.  <p>

<b>Advantages of the GIFT Procedure</b><br>

   Many researchers believe that the higher success rates reported with the GIFT technique (compared to IVF) are related to the fact that GIFT relies on the body's own natural processes and timetable to produce a healthy pre-embryo. This may be particularly the case in programs with poor IVF success rates.  At the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre we have found that GIFT offers no advantage over IVF, and it requires surgery and it is generally more expensive than IVF.<p>  

   GIFT may offer a number of distinct advantages over other fertility treatments.  Infertility may result from a number of causes:<p>

	<ul>
<li>Male factors; low sperm counts or poor sperm function are present in 30-40% of infertility cases.
<li>	Tubal and pelvic factors; damage or blockage of only one fallopian tubes, or endometriosis that has not responded to surgical or medical treatment are present in 15-20% of cases.
<li>	Cervical factors: damage to the cervix or lack of adequate mucus occur in 5-10% of cases.
<li>	Immunological factors; antibodies present on either the sperm or in the woman prevent sperm from reaching or fertilizing the eggs in 5% of cases.

  
</ul>
<p> Couples  whose infertility has occurred as a result of advanced maternal age, endometriosis and those with "unexplained" infertility, have generally been considered the best candidates for GIFT.  Couples with cervical or certain immunological factors are also appropriate candidates. Couples with a tubal factor are not usually candidates for GIFT but may be considered if one fallopian tube is normal.  Otherwise, these couples should consider IVF as an alternative.<p>

<b>The GIFT Program - Questions and Answers</b><br>
   <dl>
<dt>Q: <b>Will the GIFT technique damage my ovaries?</b>
   <dd>A: There is no evidence to suggest that either normal laparoscopy or egg retrieval damages the ovaries.  Reports in the medical literature suggest that following ovarian biopsy, pregnancies occur in couples with a long-term history of infertility.</dl>
   
<dl>
<dt>Q:<b> Will scar tissue around my ovaries make it impossible to retrieve the eggs?</b>
   <dd>A: NO.  During laparoscopy, the surgeon must be able to see the follicles in order to guide the needle to the proper spot for egg retrieval.  Although, scar tissue can be removed at the same surgical egg retrieval, a transvaginal ultrasound retrieval would be preferable.  However, the fallopian tubes must be visualized and be normal for fallopian tube transfer.  If the fallopian tube is inaccessible or appears unhealthy, IVF will be indicated.    
   
</dl><dl>
<dt>Q:<b> What if I ovulate before oocyte (also called egg or ovum) retrieval?</b>
   <dd>A: Once ovulation has occurred, it is impossible to retrieve the eggs and surgery must be canceled.  The entire team of physician, nurse and embryologist will monitor your cycle very carefully to avoid premature ovulation. Lurpon (a GnRH agonist) is used along with other drugs during the stimulation of the eggs.  Lurpon is used to prevent ovulation. 

</dl><dl>
<dt>Q:<b> If an egg is not retrieved or if the technique does not produce a pregnancy on the first attempt, how soon can the procedure be repeated?</b>
   <dd>A: Approximately three months later, depending on the individual.  The primary reason for delay is to allow the patient's normal menstrual cycle to resume.  The delay also helps avoid any cumulative effects from frequent anesthesias.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q:<b> How many times will GIFT be repeated  per couple?</b>
   <dd>A: There is no specific number.  This is determined by the couple together with their physician.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>Can we have intercourse the two-week period before the GIFT procedure  is performed?</b>
   <dd>A: Most definitely.  The physicians recommend that the husband refrain from ejaculation for 48 hours preceding egg retrieval, but not more than 5 to 7 days.  This precaution assures that the semen sample obtained for the GIFT procedure will contain a maximum number of healthy, motile sperm.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>After the GIFT procedure, how long must we wait to have intercourse? </b>
   <dd>A: Although a definite time of abstinence to avoid damage to the pre-embryo has not been determined, most experts recommend abstinence for two to three weeks.  Theoretically, the uterine contractions associated with orgasm could interfere with the early stages of implantation.  

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>What about other activities?  How soon can I resume my normal routine?</b>
   <dd>A: The GIFT team recommends that the patient be sedentary for a full 24 hours following the procedure.  Strenuous exercises such as jogging, horseback riding, swimming, etc., should be avoided until pregnancy is confirmed.  Otherwise, the patient is free to return to her regular activities.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q:<b> How soon will I know if I'm pregnant?</b>
   <dd>A: Pregnancy can be confirmed using blood tests 12 to 14 days after GIFT. 

   </dl><dl><dt>Q:<b> I had my tubes tied (tubal ligation several years ago.  Would I be a candidate for GIFT?</b>
   <dd>A: No, not at this time.  Women whose fallopian tubes are blocked due to either previous tubal ligation, infection or congenital defects are not candidates for the GIFT program. Women with tubal obstruction are better candidates for IVF.  

   </dl><dl><dt>Q:<b> What drugs are given to stimulate the ovarian follicles and to maintain the lining of the uterus prior to implantation of the pre-embryo?</b>
   <dd>A: Four to five medications normally are given: 1) <a href="incglos.html#Lupron">Luprolide acetate (Lupron)</a>, an injectable drug that blocks secretions of the pituitary gland, thereby optimizing the number of oocytes retrieved; 2) <A HREF="http://pharminfo.com/pubs/msb/menotrop.html">Human menopausal gonadotropin (Pergonal or hMG) or Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Metrodin or FSH)</a>, hormones that stimulate ovarian activity, are injected daily for about 6-8 days prior to the procedure; 3) <A hef="incglos.html#HCG>Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</a>, a hormone that mimics the action of the hormone which naturally induces ovulation, is injected 34 to 36 hours before retrieval and may be used after retrieval to supplement natural progesterone production; and 4) Progesterone, a natural hormone that enables the uterus to support pregnancy, may be used as a daily injection after egg retrieval.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>What side effects, if any, can these drugs cause?</b>
   <dd>A: No pronounced side effects have been associated with any of these drugs.  However, you should inform your physician of <i>ANY</i> allergies you have or of any previous adverse reaction to drugs.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>Will I have an egg in every follicle?</b>
   <dd>A: It varies from patient to patient.  As many as half of the follicles may not contain an egg in some patients.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q:<b> Is there a possibility of multiple births following GIFT?</b>
   <dd>A: Yes, when more than one egg is transferred.  The multiple birth rate with GIFT depends upon your age and the quality and number of eggs transferred but may be as high as 25%.  (In the normal population, the rate is one set of twins per 80 births.)

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>Is there an increased chance of birth defects if I become pregnant through GIFT?</b>
   <dd>A: There are no known ill effects.  Abnormal pre-embryos, even those produced through normal fertilization, do not seem to mature.  However, as with IVF, any long-term effects of GIFT fertilization remain to be determined.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>How much time does the entire procedure require?</b>
   <dd>A: Approximately three weeks (all as an outpatient). First, fertility drugs are administered to stimulate the ovaries.  Then, for four to six days prior to ovulation, the patient is monitored by ultrasound and blood hormone testing.  Two hours before the GIFT procedure the patient is hospitalized, on an outpatient basis.

   </dl><dl><dt>Q: <b>What happens to any extra eggs that are retrieved from my ovaries?</b>
   <dd>A: A maximum of four eggs will be transferred to the fallopian tubes for possible fertilization.  Patients will have several other options.   One option is to create pre-embryos for <a href="cryoperm.html">freezing</a> for your later use.  Other options include donating the eggs to an infertile woman who cannot produce eggs, or to simply dispose of them.  Excess eggs, if any, belong to you and you will determine their disposition prior to initiating therapy.<p>
