Animal Models
Mouse Model Useful for Determining TB Pathology


A murine study suggests that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is far more virulent
when given by the respiratory route than by the intravenous route.

Researcher Robert J.  North of New York's Trudeau Institute earlier reported
that intravenous inoculation of mice with M.  tuberculosis results in a slowly
progressive infection in the lungs, despite the acquisition of systemic host
immunity capable of resolving infection in the liver, spleen and kidneys.

"The present study was undertaken to determine whether the peculiar
susceptibility of the lungs to M.  tuberculosis infection is even more obvious
in mice infected via the respiratory route," North wrote ("M.  tuberculosis is
Strikingly More Virulent for Mice When Given via the Respiratory than via the
Intravenous Route," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1550-1553).

North found that fewer M.  tuberculosis colony-forming units (cfu) given by
aerosol were substantially more virulent for mice than much larger numbers
inoculated intravenously, as shown by a faster rate of bacillary growth in the
lungs and much shorter survival of the host.

"Earlier death of mice infected by aerosol was associated with faster
development of lung pathology, even though the number of M.  tuberculosis
given intravenously resulted in the same number of bacilli initially
implanting in the lungs as the number given by aerosol," North wrote.  "Mice
depleted of CD4 T cells died of infection much sooner than immunocompetent
mice but at about the same time after being infected via either route."

North noted that mice infected by aerosol, in contrast with those given M.
tuberculosis intravenously were incapable of resolving infection in their
livers, indicating that they generated and expressed a lower level of systemic
immunity.

"This interpretation is in keeping with the finding that mice depleted of CD4
T cells died at about the same time after infection was initiated via either
route and much earlier than immunocompetent controls," North wrote.  "In
addition, the survival time of mice infected via the respiratory route was
greatly extended if they were also infected intravenously with a larger number
of M.  tuberculosis.  Thus, a larger number of M.  tuberculosis cfu given
intravenously induces a higher level of systemic immunity than does a smaller
number given by aerosol.  This likely occurs because a larger intravenous
inoculum represents a larger quantity of replicating antigen capable of
engaging larger amounts of lymphoid tissue, including that in the spleen."

North concludes that bacilli that reach the lungs via the respiratory route
have a growth advantage over those that enter from blood during the initial
stage of infection.

"This may be because microorganisms that enter the lung via the respiratory
route are ingested by resident alveolar macrophages, whereas those that enter
from the blood need to be carried into the organ after being ingested by
monocytes, neutrophils, or pulmonary intravascular macrophages.

"Given that resident alveolar macrophages tend to be less capable than other
macrophages of killing microbial pathogens in general, it is possible that
this enables M.  tuberculosis to grow more rapidly during the initial stage of
infection.  Results of the present study support this concept in that M.
tuberculosis that entered the lung directly grew faster during the first 20
days of infection than did M.  tuberculosis that entered from blood."

Blood Banking (Chagas Disease)
Donors with T. cruzi Pose Threat to Public Health


Trypanosoma cruzi (T.  cruzi), the cause of Chagas disease, may be a
considerable public health problem in parts of the United States.

Almost one in 5,700 blood donors in Miami, Florida and nearly one in 11,600 in
Los Angeles, California were seropositive for T.  cruzi antibodies in a
large-scale seroepidemiological study, said D.A.  Leiby, Transmissible
Diseases Department, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues
("Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma Cruzi-Antibodies in a Subpopulation of
American Red Cross Blood Donors," abstract 387, American Journal of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):215).

"Despite the absence of demonstrated T.  cruzi transmission by transfusion,
the finding of seroreactive donors suggests that a significant public health
problem may exist," Leiby et al.  wrote in their presentation abstract.  They
presented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas, November 17-21, 1995.

The study was performed with the Southern California and the South Florida
Regions of the American Red Cross and Abbott Laboratories.

All volunteer blood donors in the Los Angeles and Miami Red Cross blood
centers were asked a question about their place of birth or amount of time
spent in regions endemic for T.  cruzi.  Those donors who answered "yes" and a
control group were tested for the presence of T.  cruzi antibodies by EIA
(manufactured by Abbott Laboratories).

The researchers confirmed by RIPA those samples that were repeatedly reactive
by EIA.  They then entered into case-control and look-back investigations
those donors who were confirmed T.  cruzi seroreactive.

Of the donors questioned about risk, 7.4 percent (14,480/196,832) in Los
Angeles and 11 percent (1,868/17,043) in Miami responded yes.  Of these who
answered affirmatively, 20 were confirmed by RIPA (17 donors in Los Angeles;
three in Miami).  Among these 20 individuals, the risk factor they all shared
was birth in and extended residence in a country endemic for T.  cruzi.

A look-back investigation of eight patients who previously had received blood
from the infected donors showed that none of the blood recipients had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi.

While none of the blood recipients in this particular study had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi infection, there are documented reports of
three cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease in the United States and
one case in Canada (according to a report by Ira A.  Schulman, M.D., Director
of Transfusion Medicine, LA County/USC Medical Center, delivered at the Blood
Safety & Screening Conference, October 23-25, 1995, Washington, D.C.).

Within the past 25 years, millions of immigrants have come to the United
States from countries where T.  cruzi is endemic.

Since 1991, an estimated 100,000 individuals infected with T.  cruzi reside in
North America.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Disease Markers
Increased Soluble CD14 Useful Marker in TB Patients


Increased levels of soluble CD14 are present in bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

CD14 was first identified as a marker of cells derived from the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, although it was later found on other cells like
neutrophils and B lymphocytes.  The cell surface glycoprotein serves as a
cellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide with
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased in
serum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonary
sarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum and
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheisel
and colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 are
also found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels in
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December
1995;108:1614-1616).

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologic
characteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

"The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was
increased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22
ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote.

"No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar to
patients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found in
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,
this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing to
granuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cell
surface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determine
the significance and clinical relevance of this finding."

The corresponding author for this study is Gerhard Hoheisel, Department of
Pneumology, Ruhrlandklink, Tuschener Weg 40, D-45239.

Drug Resistance
When the Antibiotic Cupboard Is Bare


Antibiotic treatment options are very scarce when vancomycin does not work
against life-threatening Gram-positive infections, according to a scientific
presentation given at the midyear clinical meeting of the American Society of
Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP), held in Las Vegas, Nevada.

"For patients with life-threatening infections that are resistant to currently
available antibiotics, the situation can be as bad as it was 54 years ago when
the United States entered World War II, and there were no antibiotics on the
medical supply shelves," said Chuck Ballow, Pharm.  D., Associate Clinical
Professor at the State University of New York in Buffalo and Director of
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring at Millard Fillmore Hospital.  "The first
penicillins were so scarce they were delivered to field hospitals in
briefcases chained to couriers' wrists."

Over the past few years, Enterococcus faecium (E.  faecium) has developed the
ability to survive and grow in the presence of vancomycin.  This bacterium is
relatively benign in healthy patients, but in those with multiple underlying
diseases, who are often hospitalized for extended periods, this pathogen can
be deadly.

The U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report an overall
incidence of 14 percent for vancomycin-resistant E.  faecium (VREF) in U.S.
intensive care units.

The death rate for VREF infections exceeds 30 percent in the studies reported
to date, compared to less than 17 percent in patients infected with less
resistant bacteria.

One reason for the increased incidence in resistance is that the Enterococcus
resides in the digestive tract, where resistant strains survive.  Ordinarily,
E.  faecium is relatively harmless, but, as patients are hospitalized due to
chronic illness or additional surgeries and they become increasingly
debilitated, even harmless bacteria overpower their diminishing host defenses.
E.  faecium has outsmarted vancomycin by changing the structure of its cell
wall through a complex interplay of genetic material that has become the most
complicated mechanism of resistance observed to date.

Today, after the introduction of many bigger, better and broader spectrum
antibiotics and the administration of literally millions of doses, the war
against bacteria wages on.  On an increasing number of fronts, the bugs have
outsmarted the drugs.

Ballow said this has happened because of a lack of appreciation for the
incredible adaptability of bacteria and the availability of hundreds of
antibiotic options.  Most pharmaceutical companies turned their attention to
developing new drugs for such diseases as heart attacks, cancer and diabetes,
instead of focusing on antibiotics.

In addition, many infectious disease experts felt confident that the
life-threatening Gram-positive resistance problems they faced in hospitals
could be handled by vancomycin, an antibiotic used for multiresistant
organisms unresponsive to the most sophisticated combinations of agents.

"Of course, this was naive in retrospect," Ballow told fellow pharmacists.
"Today we have a major problem, especially in intensive-care units."

The first agent in a class of antibiotics known as streptogramins may provide
hope against VREF.  Synercid (quinupristin-dalfopristin), an injectable
antibiotic shown to be effective against VREF, is in Phase III clinical trials
worldwide, and is currently available in the United States and Europe through
an emergency use program sponsored and administered by its developer,
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc.  (RPR), Collegeville, Pennsylvania.

Ballow reported on preliminary results of this program, which showed, overall,
70 percent of 95 evaluable patients treated with Synercid responded favorably
to the agent, meaning their symptoms improved or resolved.

Sixty-seven percent of patients with bacteremia (the most severe and
life-threatening infections) showed improvement and eradication of the
bacteria.

Ballow believes that these results are significant and promising because these
patients had serious underlying medical conditions, and each had been
previously and unsuccessfully treated with up to 11 antibiotics.

The new antibiotic is made of two individually active molecules, each of which
alone mildly halt reproduction of the bacteria, but combined have the power to
kill bacteria through inhibition of protein synthesis.

The agent has also been shown to be highly effective in laboratory tests
against the major Gram-positive strains of E.  faecium, Staphylococcus aureus,
pneumococci, and Streptococcus, including multidrug-resistant strains.

Some older drugs, which have been rarely used, if at all, for many years, may
also provide some hope, but additional studies are necessary to establish the
effectiveness of these agents in the treatment of VREF.

Emerging Diseases
Could Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?


Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animals
are imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) researchers warn.

Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only one
or two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domestic
animals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recent
programs to vaccinate wild animals.

This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention program
costs an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expenses
per year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recent
publication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public Health
Concern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).

But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.
are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidental
or intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise the
animal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from various
species of bats.

"Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccine
failures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter of
potentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequently
established in susceptible bat populations."

Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically related
negative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are the
rhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and some
isolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:

* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.
suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was first
isolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outside
Ibadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.
Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Central
African Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented human
infections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.

* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.
Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, in
Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, and
Ethiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginal
protection.

* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but is
suspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, South
Africa who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by a
bat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.
Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human case
was documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus has
been found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have been
identified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus was
first identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of a
rabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domestic
animals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

"The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New World
mitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy bats
without human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, several
recent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer of
rabies-infected bats."

These events include:

* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in research
facilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosed
with rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild big
brown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died of
rabies.

* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on a
container ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.

* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permits
in 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptian
tomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or their
offspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions or
zoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normally
subjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported bats
to prevent contact with humans.

"Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,
active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.
warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the area
that extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,
and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in a
wide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction with
other Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolon
helvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of these
species have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa.

"The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern because
of the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,
particularly in the southern United States."

Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to the
United States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior to
European colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxes
for the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.

When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillance
revealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 human
deaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960
rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.

From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but they
were then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infected
animals from southern states.

Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies has
changed.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after a
known exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975
advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in people
who had no history of an animal bite.

"Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that was
unrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"
Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has also
changed:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involved
rabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."

As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.
noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000
submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after the
epizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state.

"The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000
to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probability
of rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.

"What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account the
psychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequent
euthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.
Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the United
States, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."

Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue strongly
against population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,
economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programs
for wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC.

"Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is an
integral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,
where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5
million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabies
incidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for human
rabies."

However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required an
extensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective for
foxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes.

"In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine was
developed that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons and
various other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improved
thermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.
"When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact with
them by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,
studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,
or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate species
examined."

An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, New
Jersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baits
laced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and by
helicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantly
reduced.

Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there are
many questions yet to be answered:

* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?

* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?

* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?

* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabies
control in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?

* Who will fund these programs over time?

* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?

"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue of
extending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing world
will be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.

Encephalitis
Microsphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis Vaccine


Mouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against a
deadly form of viral encephalitis.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the family
Togaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infections
during epizootics among horses.

The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidad
donkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans and
animals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidence
suggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,
there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.

The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.
While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuated
vaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.

Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEE
virus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported their
results in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses to
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"
Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20).

"The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responses
which were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virus
vaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was more
effective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective against
systemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."

Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as a
means of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to see
the potential benefits of this technology.

"Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number of
inoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oral
vaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieve
immune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center for
Immunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,
January 1994;12(1):5-11).

Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams have
shown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effective
vehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered either
mucosally or systemically.

Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe in
humans.

Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEE
virus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that of
free virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.

Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yielded
anti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.

When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received a
second booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stable
throughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane only
in mice boosted with free virus.

"At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared with
either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducing
specific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondary
immunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5
(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processed
microspheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary and
secondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced the
immunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during the
microencapsulation procedure."

In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better than
non-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres.

"Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior to
microencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhanced
the immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhanced
conformational stability," they wrote.

In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5
(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survived
challenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received the
free virus vaccine survived challenge.

"At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccines
afforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigen
resulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival in
a second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote.

"These results, taken together with the protection results after secondary
immunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicate
that a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could afford
protection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the free
virus vaccine."

The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulated
VEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosol
challenge with virulent VEE virus.

Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama 35294.

Epidemiology (HCV)
500,000 in France Infected with HCV


At least half-a-million people in France are infected with hepatitis C virus,
according to that country's Ministry of Health.

The figures were released for the first time in an effort to clarify how many
people in France actually had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.  The Ministry
of Health report is the result of seven epidemiologic surveys conducted during
1994 and 1995 by teams of experts including virologists and specialists in
public health.  It was prepared by the National Public Health Network.

Details of the report were published in the November 4, 1995, British Journal
of Medicine (311:1187-1188).

According to the survey, at least 60 percent of the infections were
transmitted by blood transfusions or by illicit injection drug use.  The
prevalence of infections among health staff is not known but was estimated as
high as 3 percent.

The surveys included one study of 20,000 pregnant women and another involving
6,000 volunteers from the roles of people insured under the social security
system.  Results agreed with statistics gathered during routine screening of
blood donors.

Additional studies will be conducted to look at the prevalence of infection
among children and young people under the age of 20 and in people over 60.  A
survey among 6,300 people who attended routine health checks showed that
one-third of those who were seropositive had received a blood transfusion and
that one-third of those infected were not aware of their seropositivity.

It is estimated that 600 new cases of hepatitis C will be diagnosed each year
in France and that 3,500 to 5,000 patients should benefit from treatment with
interferon.

According to the report many doctors were reluctant to use this treatment,
even though studies have shown that the earlier it is started the more
effective it is.

Epidemiology (HIV)
WHO Reports 18.5 Million Have HIV


An estimated 18.5 million people worldwide are infected with HIV - a sharply
higher number attributed to better reporting rather a surge in the epidemic,
the United Nations (U.N.)  health agency said.

About six million people are thought to have developed AIDS since the start of
the epidemic in the late 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.  Of
these, 4.5 million have died.

An estimated 6,000 people are infected each day with HIV; of the 18.5 million
already infected, 1.5 million are children, the agency said.

WHO previously estimated that 1 million children and between 13 million and 15
million adults are infected with HIV and a total of 4.5 million people had
developed the disease.

The agency said the new figures reflected an improvement in estimating
techniques, better HIV prevalence studies and other research, rather than a
sudden jump in new infections.

Two-thirds of the estimated HIV cases and three-quarters of advanced AIDS
cases, are in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said.

India has the most HIV carriers - an estimated 1.75 million of its one billion
people.  Thailand - another country where experts fear an explosion in cases -
has 700,000 HIV carriers.

The highest proportional HIV rate was in Botswana, with about 18 percent of
sexually active adults infected.  An estimated 17 percent of adults aged 15-49
had the virus in Zambia and Zimbabwe and 15 percent in Uganda.

In the Americas, Haiti had the highest proportion of HIV carriers, at 4.4
percent.  The Bahamas followed at 3.9 percent, with Barbados at 2.8 percent.
In the United States, where an estimated 700,000 people were HIV positive at
the end of 1994, the infection rate was 0.5 percent.

In Europe, Spain had the highest rate of HIV infections, with 0.58 percent of
sexually active adults, followed by Switzerland with 0.2 percent, WHO said.
WHO is forced to rely on estimates to gauge the spread of HIV and AIDS because
actual cases reported by governments give little idea of the true picture,
especially in Africa.

North Korea reports no cases of HIV.

Although WHO estimated the true number of AIDS cases at six million, the
actual number reported by governments was 1.3 million.  The United States
accounted for 39 percent of all the reported cases but only 7 percent of the
estimated cases.

The figures for HIV infections are for the end of 1994, while the AIDS figures
include cases that developed in 1995.  A WHO official said there was a slight
overlap in the two categories.

Infection Control
TB and AIDS Programs - Natural Partners or Not?


Can tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and treatment programs be successfully
combined?

The question was debated during a tuberculosis (TB) conference in Paris with
researchers expressing differing views.

D.A.  Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less than
compatible, because they target different groups.

"Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIV
prevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted.

"Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,
attempts to combine them are difficult."

Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conference
on Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.

Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is the
same - to prevent infections - the focus must be different.

"In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of case
management in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventing
transmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstract
presented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.
Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit the
infection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infected
person who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection.

"Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on general
health education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point of
implementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point of
implementation must be the general population of subsets of it."

R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Program
countered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs is
essential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficiently
implement.

"Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,
but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Brien
noted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient care
and help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling is
not widely available."

O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patients
with TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TB
programs and prevent further TB transmission in households.

O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis
to be lacking.

"AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which together
can address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLD
meeting.

"Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for working
separately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is now
recognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death in
HIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer be
permitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care and
preventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."

The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programs
for people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis in
developing areas.

"Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home care
programs for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomed
rapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLD
conference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100
different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affected
families, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals can
scarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families have
seriously deteriorated, due to AIDS.

"More than half of the people with HIV related illness will develop
tuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to complete
treatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various health
care programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses and
reduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist within
home care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in close
contact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB disease
among HIV infected and affected family members.  Home care staff could provide
drugs, supervise DOT and educate families and communities about HIV and TB
prevention and care.  Projects in Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have
already implemented joint TB and AIDS home care programs."

Researcher D.A.  Enarson is from the IUATLD, Paris, France.  R.  O'Brien and
E.  van Praag are from the Global Tuberculosis Program and the Global Program
on AIDS, World Health Organization, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.

Influenza
Killer Flu Expected


Influenza could develop a new form and trigger a worldwide epidemic at any
time, experts caution.

At a conference of more than 200 infectious disease specialists, work has
started on a plan to prepare for what some believe is an inevitable pandemic,
or worldwide epidemic, of killer flu.

John LaMontagne of the U.S.  National Institutes of Health (NIH) said at the
conference that the flu virus is "dynamic and very resourceful" and can change
rapidly into forms that overwhelm natural human defenses.  "We anticipate we
will have another pandemic, but we don't know when," he said.

Dr.  Dominick Iacuzio of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said concern about another pandemic led to his
organizing the conference.  "It has happened before, and it can happen again,"
he said.

The last major worldwide flu epidemic was in 1968, the so-called "Hong Kong
flu."  New strains of the flu virus typically sweep through the international
population every ten to 40 years.

"Some experts say we are overdue," said Iacuzio.

Alan Hansen of the World Health Organization (WHO) said modern transportation
makes it possible for new flu viruses to touch every continent within a matter
of weeks - it once took many months.

In 1918-1919, a new viral strain infected more than 2 billion people and
killed an estimated 20 million to 40 million.  The "Asian flu" in 1957 was
also new and caused 750,000 deaths in the United States alone.

Iacuzio said the Bethesda, Maryland, conference was called to help
international experts identify the gaps in what is known about the flu virus
and its control.

A formal report is being prepared, but these findings will be among the
conclusions, he said:

* Increased surveillance, particularly in remote Asian areas, is needed for
early detection of new flu viral strains.  If a potentially new form of the
flu is found early enough, said Iacuzio, the pandemic could be blunted by
rapidly producing a new vaccine.

* Some experts believe the concentration of proteins used in the flu vaccine
could be reduced, thus making more doses available.  "We don't know the
answers to this," said Iacuzio, and that knowledge could be critical if there
is a sudden, worldwide need for vaccine.

* Final work on vaccines that can be applied as nose spray or nose drops must
be completed.  These so-called "cold-adapted vaccines" use modified live virus
and have been shown to be effective in some studies.  Iacuzio said their
availability in a pandemic could save many lives by protecting people against
the disease.

* Antivirals, drugs used to treat the flu infections, could provide physicians
with important new weapons in treating patients already infected.  Iacuzio
said candidate drugs are being tested, but are not available.  Such drugs need
to be speedily developed, he said.

Occupational Exposure (TB)
Most TB in New York HCWs Due to Recent Infections 


A finding that most tuberculosis cases among health care workers in a New York
study were due to recent infections suggests that occupational transmission of
tuberculosis routinely occurs in facilities without recognized tuberculosis
(TB) outbreaks, according to Cornell University's Public Health Research
Institute.

A number of nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred across the United
States during 1990 and 1991, resulting in several deaths among personnel in
contact with infected patients.  These outbreaks prompted the issuance of new
guidelines for health care workers from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).

"Since (the implementation of the CDC guidelines) there have been relatively
few reported outbreaks, which suggests that current control measures may be
effective," researcher Kent A Sepkowitz and colleagues wrote ("TB Among Urban
Health Care Workers:  A Study Using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism
Typing," Clinical Infectious Diseases, November 1995;21:1098-1102).

"However, it is not known whether the apparently sporadic cases of
tuberculosis in health care workers are due to occupationally acquired
infections or, as a recent study suggested, are more likely due to
community-acquired infections.  In addition, the risk for HIV infected
personnel is not well defined, although some have suggested that HIV infected
health care workers should have the option of being assigned to an area
associated with a low risk of exposure to tuberculosis."

In this study Sepkowitz and colleagues at New York's Cornell University
Medical College analyzed cases of tuberculosis using laboratory-based active
surveillance system for TB at six hospitals in New York City (members of the
TBNetwork).

Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992 to 1994 were analyzed according
to the occupational status of the patients.

The researchers reviewed medical records and restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was
performed.

"No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in
the study period," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Occupational status was known
for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing.
Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as
determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease."

RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65 percent) of 20 health care
workers and 50 (41 percent) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered
RFLP pattern.

Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status
revealed that HIV status and health care worker status were independent risk
factors for a clustered RFLP strain.

The recent transmission rate of 65 percent outlined by Sepkowitz et al.  is
greater than that seen among health care workers with tuberculosis in Bern,
Switzerland, San Francisco, California, or the Bronx, New York.

Sepkowitz et al.  conclude that many apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis
among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational
transmission.

The authors note, however, that the cases analyzed in their report probably
reflect transmissions that occurred prior to the time hospitals updated
infection control procedures.

"Our data suggest that occupational transmission of tuberculosis occurs in
hospitals without recognized outbreaks," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Health
care workers with HIV infection appear to be at particular risk.  Prospective
RFLP-based studies will be useful to confirm these findings and may help
determine the efficacy of current guidelines for preventing transmission of
tuberculosis in health care settings."

Respiratory Syncytial Virus
Human RSV Succumbs to Bioengineering Techniques


Bioengineered production of infectious human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
provides immediate applications for the development of a live attenuated
vaccine.

RSV is considered the most important pediatric viral respiratory pathogen
worldwide.  It is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality and
lacks an approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy.  In addition to the
lack of a good animal model (other than the chimpanzee), RSV does not grow
well in culture.  Both of these problems have impeded research, making the
development of a vaccine difficult.

Peter L.  Collins et al.  produced infectious human RSV from cloned cDNA
particles in vitro paving the way for development of live attenuated vaccine
strains ("Production of Infectious Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus from
Cloned cDNA Confirms an Essential Role for the Transcription Elongation Factor
from the 5' Proximal Open Reading Frame of the M2 mRNA in Gene Expression and
Provides a Capability for Vaccine Development," Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11563-67).

"An exciting possibility is that RSV might be engineered in ways that enhance
its immunogenicity and induce a level of protection greater than that provided
by natural infection," noted Collins et al.  In addition "RSV can be evaluated
as a possible vector for protective antigens of other respiratory tract
pathogens.  An RSV vector also might have utility in transient gene therapy of
the respiratory tract."

The cloned RSV was produced by the intracellular coexpression of five
plasmid-born cDNAs.  One encoded a complete positive-sense version of the RSV
genome, and each of the other four encode a separate RSV protein.  If any of
these were deleted, RSV was not produced.  The cDNA segments were synthesized
by reverse transcription (RT)-coupled PCR (RT-PCR) from intracellular RSV mRNA
or virion-derived genome RNA.

They noted that the strategy for producing infections RSV from cDNA-express
antigenome involved its coexpression with those RSV proteins that were
necessary and sufficient to complete two important processes:  1) the ability
to produce an antigenomic nucleocapsid capable of RNA replication and 2) to
render the progeny genomic nucleocapsid competent for both RNA replication and
transcription.  Transcription by the genomic nucleocapsid would then provide
all of the other RSV proteins and initiate a productive infection.

Recently, this approach was successfully accomplished with two rhabdoviruses,
rabies and vesicular stomatitis virus, by M.J.  Schnell et al.  (EMBO J.,
1994;13:4195-4203) and N.D.  Lawson et al.  (PNAS, 1995;92:4477-81).

The possibility also exists that defined mutations can be introduced into
these infectious RSV clones.  This could have multiple applications toward the
understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of this particularly
difficult to study virus.

"It may be possible to insert foreign sequence into the RSV genome for
coexpression," concluded Collins et al.  "Genes of interest for evaluation
include those encoding cytokines, antagonists thereof, or proteins rich in
T-helper-cell epitopes.  This offers the possibility of modifying and
improving the immune response quantitatively and qualitatively."

Infectious Disease, 7 Center Drive, MSC 0720, NIAID, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-0720, USA.

Transmission (TB)
Primary School Teacher in Amsterdam Infects 19 Students


A primary school teacher with tuberculous laryngitis in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, infected all of his students with tuberculosis (TB) before his
disease was detected.

All 19 children who had been taught by the teacher became infected with TB and
four contracted active disease, according to a report presented at the 1995
Annual Meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease (IUATLD), held in Paris, France.

"Three months after the start of the new school year, the notification of
primary tuberculosis in two children of the same primary school urged the
local Municipal Health Service to perform source detection and contact
tracing," researcher S.T.  Keizer and colleagues from The Netherlands' Health
Service wrote in an abstract presented at the IUATLD conference.

Extensive testing was conducted and those with a skin induration of 10 mm or
more were considered infected.  A case of primary tuberculosis was defined as
the combination of a positive Mantoux test and compatible radiographic
findings.

"A teacher was identified as the source case," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "At the
time of detection he was without symptoms, yet his chest X-ray showed typical
infiltration of the left upper lobe and his sputum was Ziehl-Neelsen positive.
His medical history revealed that he had been suffering from severe hoarseness
for three months until a benign growth was removed from his vocal cords during
the summer-holidays.  The pathologist had reported the presence of epithelioid
cell granuloma indicating tuberculosis, but this had not reached the attention
of the otorhinolaryngist."

Nearly one-third of all 99 children at the school were found to be infected
with tuberculosis.

"All 19 children who had been taught by our patient until the summer holidays
were infected," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "Among them were four cases of primary
tuberculosis.  In the group (13 children) that had entered his class after the
summer-holidays only one infection was detected.  It is concluded that this
teacher was extremely infectious during the time he was hoarse from a
tuberculous laryngeal lesion.  The consideration of TB in the differential
diagnosis of laryngeal lesions needs emphasis for individual and for public
health reasons."

Xenotransplantation
Baboon BMT Experiment a Reality


Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Structured
Biologicals Inc.  (SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBI
sponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon to
an AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.

On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive an
experimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on the
experiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneering
AIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.

The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division of
Cellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadt
discovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates the
risk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfully
fights transplant rejection.

Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that the
uninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow to
restore the patient's immune function.

The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change the
practice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanent
acceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver as
well as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matching
or prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.

The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmune
diseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,
Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and may
ultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-species
transplantation).

"Accuracy of Chest Radiograph Interpretation in the Diagnosis of Pneumocystis
carinii Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Tuberculosis in HIV
Positive Patients."  P.M.  Boiselle, I.  Tocino, R.J.  Hooley, A.S.

Pumerantz, P.A.  Selwyn and V.P.  Neklesa, et al.  New Haven, Connecticut.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To assess the accuracy of
chest radiographic interpretation in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in
HIV-positive patients and to identify the frequency with which these
infections mimic each other radiographically.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The
admitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratory
proved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIV
positive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively and
independently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinical
presentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and final
diagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followed
by an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis was
made in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the median
accuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and no
active disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderate
interobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked other
infections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis by
all 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretation
allows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIV
positive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.  In
approximately 10% of cases, these infections may mimic each other
radiographically."

December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  Tuberculosis (TB) in AIDS
patients has a more aggressive and different pathologic picture than it does
in non-AIDS patients; this fact influences the methods of diagnosis and
treatment.  Gallium studies have been recommended in the work-up of these
patients.  The purpose of this study was to review the gallium scans in all
AIDS patients with a proved diagnosis of TB to find the sites of involvement
and causes of false negative gallium scanning and to provide correlation with
chest x-ray findings.  CONCLUSION:  Lymph node involvement with TB infection
in AIDS patients is more common than parenchymal lung involvement.  The
mediastinal and supraclavicular areas were involved most often, followed by
the axillary, upper abdominal and inguinal regions.  Anti-TB treatment affects
the sensitivity of gallium scanning in AIDS patients with TB."

with Normal ALT."  M.  Diago, P.  Carbonell, C.  Gonzalez, R.  Zapater, R.
Cors, P.  Rivera, C.  Tuset and J.  Villalba.  Hepatology and Immunology

Sections, Hospital General University, Valencia, Spain.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "The aim is to determine the clinical and
histological findings in patients with anti HCV RIBA 2 indeterminate and
normal ALT.  We studied 81 patients (39 men and 42 women, age 41.1, range
19-64).  In each patient, the clinical and epidemiological data were
collected.  Liver function test, anti HIV, markers of hepatitis B, RNA-VHC (by
PCR), anti HCV RIBA 3 and liver biopsy were performed in all the patients.  We
compared histological findings according to the results of PCR-VHC (+/-), the
antibody band positive in RIBA 2 and the RIBA 3 results (+/-/indeterminate).
RESULTS:  Previous transfusion was present in 18.5% (15/81) and without
parenteral antecedents in 72.8% (59/81).  ALT levels were persistently normal
in all patients, and they were HIV and HBsAg negative.  Previous HBV infection
was detected in 22.8%.  Histological diagnoses were:  Chronic hepatitis (CAH
or CPH) in 49% (40/81), Fatty liver in 8.6%(7/81), Minimal changes in 31%
(25/81) and normal liver in 11% (9/81).  RNA-VHC (PCR) was positive in 8
patients:  2 CPH, 3 CAH, 3 MC.  Histological diagnoses in the 73 PCR negative
patients were 27 CPH (37%), 7CAH (9.6%), 7 FL (9.6%), 1 CH (1.3%), 22 MC (30%)
and 9 normal liver (12.3%).  The RIBA 3 was positive in 10% of RIBA 2 positive
patients, negative in 10% and indeterminate in 80%.  CONCLUSIONS:  Only 27% of
RIBA 2 indeterminate patients had a parenteral risk of HCV acquisition.  Half
of the patients with RIBA 2 indeterminate had chronic hepatitis and only 8.6%
had a normal liver.  RNA (by PCR) was detected in 10%.  There is no
relationship between the band of RIBA 2 indeterminate and the severity of
liver disease.  Eighty per cent of RIBA 2 indeterminate patients were RIBA 3
indeterminate."

Immunology (TB)
"Regulation of the Human Cellular Immune Response in Tuberculosis."  J.J.
Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemic
immune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayed
type hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, and
in vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.
Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chiefly
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,
depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression of
cytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) function
in autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,
respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) from
virulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)
relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,
TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increased
spontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated
production of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)
reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gamma
expression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppression
and energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restores
PPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,
and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too may
reflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding of
immunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions for
immunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes and
monocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serum
and cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosis
patients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,
monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;
and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infected
macrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutually
enhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for a
subunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role for
extracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.
Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominance
of certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine or
DTH skin test."

Infection Control (TB)
"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."  E.  Sumartojo.  Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Tuberculosis control is directed towards ensuring that patients complete
treatment without infecting others.  Relevant Behavioral and social factors
concern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatment
outcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, and
health care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patients
and for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIV
infected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality of
treatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the core
Behavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observed
therapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; where
successful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social and
Behavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographic
research has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals about
tuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associate
tuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about the
appropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed about
the cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show the
effectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, and
comprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinic
practices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research is
emerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk to
patients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studies
of treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, with
implications for the education and supervision of physicians who treat
tuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development of
locally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral research
must focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existing
descriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory and
research methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues will
be identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types of
patients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,
and ensuring that persons with high likelihood of exposure or HIV infection
seek screening and complete preventive therapy or treatment for tuberculosis."

United Kingdom.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "The natural history of chronic HCV is poorly
understood.  We prospectively monitored the histological progression of
chronic HCV infection in untreated asymptomatic patients using serial two
yearly liver biopsies.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Sixty five asymptomatic HCV
RIBA positive blood donors (48 male, 17 female, median age 37 years) referred
from the Blood Transfusion Service were investigated.  Forty had an overt
parenteral risk factor for HCV exposure - 36 IVDU, 4 prior transfusion.  All
were HCV RNA+ve.  Seventeen patients (26%) had normal initial transaminases.
Median ALT was 48iu (range 9-440, normal <30), AST 48iu (range 14-200, normal
30iu).  Liver biopsy was recommended for all patients, and histology was
scored (without reference to clinical details) according to a modified Knodell
histological activity index (HAI, maximum possible score 13).  63 patients had
an initial biopsy:  median HAI=2, mean HAI=2.8, range 08, none cirrhotic.
When HAI>=6 (9 patients), treatment with alpha interferon was recommended.
When HAI<6 (54 patients), interferon was not used but 2 yearly follow-up
biopsies were recommended.  To date, 29 biopsies have been repeated in
untreated patients - 16 deteriorated, 4 improved, 9 unchanged.  In re-biopsied
patients median HAI increased from 2 to 3.  Serum HCV RNA titre was not
related to progression.  The median ALT at 2 years was unchanged in untreated
patients.  CONCLUSIONS:  In asymptomatic RIBA+ve patients initial histological
changes are mild.  In many patients there is a slow histological progression
over 2 years."

Disease of Captive New World Primates Caused by Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis

Virus."  American Journal of Pathology, November 1995;147(5):1441-1449.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Pathology, "Callitrichid hepatitis is an arenavirus infection that recently
emerged as a highly fatal disease of New World primates in the Callitrichidae
family.  As we previously reported, these primates develop hepatitis after
contact with mice that are infected with variants of LCMV (LCMV(CH)), recently
determined to have 86% identity with GC-P gene of the Armstrong and Western
strains of LCMV.  Here, we describe the histopathological lesions and tissue
localization of viral antigens in confirmed cases of callitrichid hepatitis
from recent outbreaks in two U.S.  zoos.  The liver in marmosets and tamarins
with fatal infections consistently showed degeneration, necrosis, and
inflammation, with variable involvement of the spleen, lymph nodes, adrenal
glands, intestine, pancreas, and central nervous system.  Lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus antigens were identified immunohistochemically in
necrotic foci in these organs as well as in nondegenerating areas in lungs,
kidneys, urinary bladder, brain, and testes.  The multi-organ tropism and
histological pattern of LCMV infection in marmosets and tamarins are similar
to those reported for the highly virulent arenavirus that causes lassa fever
in humans.  Comparative studies of callitrichid hepatitis and Lassa fever
would therefore be mutually beneficial for human and nonhuman primate
medicine."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RJ Montali,

beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae isolates, and 36.4%
amoxicillin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates.  All of these bacteria were
fully susceptible to ceftriaxone.  Nosocomial multiply-resistant bacteria, and
particularly methicillin-resistant S.  aureus, were found, as expected, at a
higher frequency among previously hospitalized patients.  However, such
bacteria may be present in the community; their incidence is high in
particular clinical settings, and such bacteria should be considered when one
is choosing a first-line therapy for the treatment of severe infections."  The

Nosocomial (Catheter Colonization)
Raad, I.; Darouiche, R.; Hachem, R.; Sacilowski, M.; Bodey, G.P.  "Antibiotics
and Prevention of Microbial Colonization of Catheters."  Antimicrobial Agents
and Chemotherapy, November 1995;39(11):2397-2400.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy, "Slime-producing staphylococci frequently colonize
catheters, and when they are embedded in biofilm, they become resistant to
various antibiotics.  In the study that is described, the comparative
efficacies of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone or
in combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model of
colonization.  The model consisted of the modified Robbins device with
antibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments.  The
synergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most efficacious
in preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing strains of
Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to catheter surfaces.  A
similar trend was observed when the inhibitory activities of polyurethane
catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin were compared with the
inhibitory activities of catheters coated with other antimicrobial agents.
The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin
against S.  epidermidis, S.  aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis strains, for
example, were significantly better than those of catheters coated with
vancomycin (P<0.05).  The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with
minocycline and rifampin against gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans
were comparable to those of catheters coated with ceftazidime and amphotericin
B, respectively.  We found that the combination of minocycline and rifampin is
unique and highly effective in preventing the colonization of catheters with
slime-producing staphylococci and that it also displays a broad-spectrum
inhibitory activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeast cells."  The

Nosocomial (Infectious Diarrhea)
Porco, F.V.; Visconte, E.B.  "Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a Cause of Infectious
Diarrhea Successfully Treated with Oral Ciprofloxacin."  Annals of
Pharmacotherapy, November 1995;29(11):1122-1123.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Annals of
Pharmacotherapy, "OBJECTIVE:  To describe an immunocompromised patient
(without AIDS) with nosocomial infectious diarrhea caused by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.  Oral ciprofloxacin therapy proved to be effective.  CASE SUMMARY:
An 80-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed
progressive renal insufficiency, was hospitalized because of uremia, and
underwent hemodialysis.  When the patient developed hematochezia, Duke's C
sigmoid colon cancer was detected and successfully resected.  She received
broad-spectrum antibiotics in the perioperative period.  The patient then
developed profuse diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping, a low-grade
fever, prostration, and headache.  The patient then started to receive
vancomycin 500 mg po qid empirically.  Four days later, the diarrhea continued
unabated, the Clostridium difficile titer was negative, and the vancomycin
therapy was stopped.  However, the stool culture was positive for heavy growth
of P.  aeruginosa sensitive to ciprofloxacin.  The patient then began to
receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid.  Within 3 days the diarrhea stopped.
Oral ciprofloxacin therapy was continued for 10 days and the patient remained
free of symptoms with formed stools thereafter.  DISCUSSION:  Diarrhea
following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics implicates pseudomembranous
colitis as the cause.  The patient did not respond to oral vancomycin therapy
and had a negative stool assay for C.  difficile toxin.  This patient was
believed to have Pseudomonas enteritis, which was confirmed by 2 positive
stool cultures.  The administration of oral ciprofloxacin therapy stopped her
diarrhea with a rapid resolution of symptoms.  CONCLUSIONS:  P.  aeruginosa as
a cause of infectious diarrhea is unusual.  When it occurs, it usually
represents a nosocomial infection in an immunocompromised host.  This report
illustrates that oral ciprofloxacin therapy is effective for Pseudomonas
enteritis, with rapid resolution of symptoms."  The corresponding author for

Nosocomial (Pneumonia)
Djedaini, K.; Billiard, M.; Mier, L.; Lebourdelles, G.; Brun, P.; Markowicz,
P.; Estagnasie, P.; Coste, F.; Boussougant, Y.; Dreyfuss, D.  "Changing Heat
and Moisture Exchangers Every 48 Hours Rather Than 24 Hours Does Not Affect

Their Efficacy and the Incidence of Nosocomial Pneumonia."  American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November 1995;152(5):1562-1569.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "Heat and moisture exchangers (HME)
(Dar-Hygrobac II, Peters) can safely be used every 24 h for longterm
mechanical ventilation and provide a cost-saving alternative to heated
humidifiers.  We have prospectively determined whether changing HMEs every 48
h only affects their clinical and bacteriological efficiency in a series of
consecutive nonselected ICU patients requiring long-term mechanical
ventilation.  Two consecutive periods were compared.  During period 1, HMEs
were replaced every day; during period 2, they were changed every 48 h.
Patients from the two periods were similar in terms of age and indication for
and overall duration of MV (10 +/- 8.6 versus 10 +/- 9 d, P=0.9).  Minute
ventilation and maximum values for peak airway pressure were identical during
the two periods.  These values were also identical after 1 and 2 d of HME use
during period 2, indicating that HME resistance was not increased by prolonged
use.  Obstruction of the tracheal tube occurred only once in a period 1
patient.  The results of quantitative cultures indicate that the maximum and
mean levels of bacterial colonization during the two periods were similar for
the pharynx, trachea, Y-connector, patient, and ventilator side of the HM 8.
More importantly, the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia was similar during the
two periods (6/61 versus 8/68, P=0.7).  Thus, prolonged HME use is safe and
provides a substantial reduction in the cost of mechanical ventilation."  The

Universal Infant Hepatitis B Vaccination Recommendations."  Pediatrics,
November 1995;96(5 Part 1):875-879.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Pediatrics,
"OBJECTIVE:  To assess the extent to which hospitals in a midwestern state
with low acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) morbidity offered hepatitis B (Hep B)
vaccine to all infants, whether offering infants Hep B vaccine was associated
with hospital geographic location or size, as measured by the number of
births, and how hospital staff resolved key programmatic issues.  METHODS:
The managers of hospital newborn nurseries (n=110) were surveyed by mail.  The
written response rate was 72%; all of the nonresponders were interviewed by
telephone.  The outcome measured was the number of hospitals offering Hep B
vaccine to all infants by geographic region and hospital size.  RESULTS:
Sixty-five percent of the hospitals routinely offered Hep B vaccine to all
infants; these hospitals accounted far 80% of reported Wisconsin births.  In
univariate analysis, the decision to offer infants Hep B vaccine was
associated with both hospital size and hospital location.  After controlling
for size, hospitals in the northeastern region were eight times more likely
(relative risk, 8.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.30, 51.79) to offer infants
Hep B vaccine than hospitals in the southeastern (referent) region.  Regional
differences in reported rates of acute HBV infection do not explain this
finding, because morbidity in the northeastern region (1 per 100,000) is among
the lowest in Wisconsin.  Although more than 80% of hospitals with Hep B
vaccination programs required written informed consent for vaccination, had
standing orders for administering Hep B vaccine to infants whose mothers'
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test results were known, and had
mechanisms to notify the infants' physicians that the infants had been
vaccinated, only 38% had standing orders for testing mothers whose HBsAg test
results were unknown.  CONCLUSIONS:  Hospitals are not necessarily deterred
from implementing infant Hep B vaccination programs by low community HBV
morbidity.  Hospitals should develop policies to assure that parturient women
with unknown HBsAg status are screened and their infants are appropriately
treated."  The corresponding author for this study is:  MB Hurie, Wisconsin

Pneumocystis carinii

Critically III Patients with Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia."  American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November
1995;152(5):1435-1442.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "The objective of the present study
was to assess the association between type of health insurance coverage and
use of diagnostic tests and therapies among patients with AIDS-related
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).  Fifty-six private, public, and
community hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami were selected for the
study, and the charts of 890 patients with empirically treated or
cytologically confirmed PCP, hospitalized during 1987 to 1990 were
retrospectively reviewed.  Patients were classified by insurance status:
self-pay (n=56), Medicaid (n=254), or private insurance, including health
maintenance organizations and Medicare (n=580).  Primary outcomes were the use
and timing of bronchoscopy, the type and timing of PCP therapy, and
in-hospital mortality.  The results indicate that Medicaid patients were less
likely than privately insured patients to undergo bronchoscopy (relative odds
= 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.93; P=0.02) or to have their diagnosis of PCP
confirmed (relative odds = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.77), after adjusting for
patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.  Medicaid patients
were approximately three-fourths more likely than privately insured patients
(relative odds = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.96; P=0.04) to die in-hospital, after
adjusting for patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.
However, with further adjustment for confirmation of PCP, Medicaid patients no
longer had a significantly higher likelihood of dying in-hospital.  We
conclude that Medicaid patients are less likely to receive diagnostic
bronchoscopy than privately insured or self-insured patients, more likely to
be empirically treated for PCP, and more likely to die in-hospital.  Higher
mortality among Medicaid patients may result from failure to diagnose and
treat alternative pathogens, a consequence of worse access to invasive
diagnostic tests."  The corresponding author for this study is:  CL Bennett,

Varicella-Zoster Virus
Perry, C.M.; Bryson, H.M.  "Oka/Merck Varicella Vaccine:  A Review of Its
Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy Against Varicella."  Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, November 1995;4(5):396-416.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, "Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine
produced from the Oka strain of the herpesvirus varicella zoster virus (VZV).
The Oka strain of VZV is recognized as having low virulence while eliciting
humoral and cell-mediated responses to VZV.  In numerous studies, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine achieved a seroconversion rate of >95% in healthy children
and adolescents.  In immunocompromised children with leukaemia in remission,
seroconversion was achieved in 80% of vaccinees 12 months after vaccination.
Cell-mediated immune responses generally closely paralleled humoral immune
responses.  The vaccine is also immunogenic in healthy adults.  In healthy
children, a high level of protection was conferred by Oka/Merck varicella
vaccine, and in the only double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted to
date the vaccine was 98% effective in protecting healthy children against
varicella during 2 varicella seasons.  In children with leukaemia, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine was 80% effective in protecting against mild varicella and
conferred 100% protection against moderate and severe varicella.  In healthy
adults, the rate of protection against varicella was reported to be
approximately 50%.  All observed cases of varicella in healthy and
immunocompromised vaccinees were mild and there were no reports of ay
disease-related complications.  Interestingly in children and adolescents with
leukaemia, the incidence of herpes tester was lower in children who received
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine than in similar children who had natural immunity.
Mild varicelliform rash (occasionally accompanied by fever) has been observed
in healthy children, adolescents and adults who have received Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine.  Pain at the injection site was the adverse effect most
frequently reported in one large study of the vaccine in healthy children.  In
children with leukaemia, vaccine-associated rash has been reported in up to
50% of vaccinees.  When Oka/Merck varicella vaccine was administered to
healthy children in combination with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine there
was no increase in the incidence of skin rashes compared with that caused by
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in combination with placebo.  Thus,
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a highly immunogenic vaccine that confers a
high level of protection against typical varicella in healthy children and
adolescents, and in children and adolescents with leukaemia.  While results of
further long term studies investigating the persistence of protective immunity
against varicella are awaited with interest, available darn indicate that
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a major advance in the prevention of this
common and highly infectious disease."  The corresponding author for this
