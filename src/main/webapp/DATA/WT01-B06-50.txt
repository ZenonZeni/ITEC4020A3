<STRONG>A comparison of FOX vs. StreetSmart</STRONG><BR>

Reviewed by Paul D. Garverick<P>

StreetSmart
by Charles Schwab<P>

Fidelity Online Xpress
by Fidelity Investments<P>


As America rushes to get on-line to do everything, two major forces in personal investing have created an on-line resource for individuals. Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments both offer services that give users the ability to trade, track, and do research for their investment portfolio on-line. <P>

StreetSmart and Fidelity On-line Xpress (FOX) both offer the ability to directly access account information, including positions and values. Also, real time quotes and research information are available through tie-ins to the brokerage houses, and Telescan, S&P MarketScope, and Dow Jones News/Retrieval databases. <P>

Who would want these electronic tie- ins to do stock trading? Of the 75% of AAII members who are computer users, half of that group subscribe to an on-line service and use it regularly, which creates a large group of potential investors who would want to place trades and do research all with one program. All three major on-line services (America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy) offer their subscribers the ability to research stocks and place trades through on-line brokerage houses. It seems like a natural fit that a brokerage company would like to offer their members direct access without going through another service provider. </P>


<STRONG>Setup</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

Of the two programs, it's easier to start with Fidelity On-line Xpress. While the installation of StreetSmart is quick (one disk) and the screen is nice to look at (it is a Windows program), the changes made to your computer are sometimes tough to remove. Both programs include ample documentation including quick start guides, brokerage information, fully documented manuals, and ample and friendly technical support personnel. The StreetSmart documentation can sometimes be confusing because there are three different books-I was never sure which one I should be looking in for a particular answer. <P>

In setting up the programs, each user needs to enter some basic information to initiate contact. StreetSmart uses the CompuServe network providing local access numbers to most every person in the U.S. and Canada, as well as baud rates up to 14400 bps. FOX operates through the TYMNET network, which provides the same local access and several international numbers; however, the program limits you to a maximum speed of 9600 bps. <P>

FOX requires a local access number, the communications port your modem occupies, and your Social Security number. Enter those three items and the program handles the rest. FOX will initiate the call and access all of your Fidelity holdings, including mutual funds and brokerage accounts. The Fidelity network provides account balances, number of shares held, and a history of transactions, for all securities. StreetSmart can provide the same information, except the history of transactions, but users need to request each piece separately. Transactions are available on StreetSmart, but only for the past 30 days. If you are an infrequent trader or trying to compile a yearly list of transactions, StreetSmart will not be able to provide all the transactions you require. <P>

Since StreetSmart is a Windows program, there are other areas where the setup is made easier. StreetSmart will utilize your existing mouse and printer drivers from Windows so there is no need for some of the setup routines required in FOX. <P>


<STRONG>Basics</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>
Retrieving quotes and placing orders will be the basic forms of usage for the two programs. One benefit of using the electronic interface is a discount on trading commissions. Both Fidelity and Schwab offer 10% off their regular commission charges for all orders placed electronically. On the sample trades that I placed, Schwab's commission fees were lower on all three trades, but the trades were on high-volume/high-priced stocks-the test was not performed across the full spectrum of stocks. <P>

In addition to trading discounts, both brokerages offer real-time quotes. Quotes are allotted on a soft dollar basis, meaning that you gain more quotes for every trade you execute with the system. Fidelity is a slightly more complicated system in that the quotes are allotted by calls. <P>

Fidelity On-line Xpress customers are allotted five calls in the beginning. One call can retrieve up to 50 quotes, which would put them on equal footing with Schwab, which offers 100 free quotes. Fidelity offers additional calls based on the frequency of your trading. Quarterly traders executing one to four trades per year receive five additional calls per transaction. Monthly traders executing five to 12 orders per year receive 20 more calls for each order. Weekly traders who execute 13 to 52 transactions per year will notch 40 more calls per trade, and anyone trading more than 52 times per year receives 60 additional calls per trade. <P>

Schwab is easier to figure out in that every trade receives an additional 100 quotes. New Schwab accounts receive 100 quotes and new StreetSmart users gain an additional 100 real-time quotes. If you use your quote allotment with either service you can still get 15-minute delayed quotes through Dow Jones News/Retrieval, at their rate. <P>

Quotes can be retrieved with both programs either in groups or separately. FOX allows users to set up named quote lists that contain equities, mutual funds, options, bonds, indexes, or market digest indicators. Schwab prices one main quote list at a time that can contain stocks, options, mutual funds or several indexes that are included as choices in the program. Figure 3 illustrates a quote list from each program. A group of quotes and an expanded single quote (Figure 4) from each program show similar basic data as well as unique elements for each specific program. <P>

Retrieving the quotes from each program has its own unique steps. StreetSmart stores a list of securities and indexes that are available to choose immediately. If you want to use an existing list of quotes from previous sessions the retrieval process is quick. Simply choose the securities you want to price and click the button labeled "Get Quotes." However, if you want quotes on a new security you need to go through a process of creating a quote list where you must add the security to your potential list. <P>

To add a security on Fidelity's program you need to create a list first. A quote list will speed the process of pricing the same group of securities often. When you add a security in FOX you have the option of using either a ticker symbol or name and letting FOX look up the ticker symbol. This is a useful feature for securities like bonds where you may not know the ticker symbol. <P>

Both StreetSmart and FOX allow users to store retrieved quotes and export the data to other programs. This is a valuable feature for people who do not have another data source or want to use their existing quotes in another program. Fidelity and StreetSmart both export in a comma-delimited format. <P>


<STRONG>Trading</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

The Fidelity and Schwab brokerage houses have always attempted to be the full-service discount brokers, so the introduction of their on-line trading software was greatly anticipated. The main reason to buy software such as this seems to be the avoidance of any human contact in your investment process. With StreetSmart and FOX you can now screen a universe of stocks in the Dow Jones News/Retrieval gateway, retrieve a price chart history directly from Schwab or through Telescan on Fidelity, download a company summary report, get a real-time quote, and finally place your trade and receive a confirmation on-line. <P>

This process has come full circle in that the full-service discount brokers have now made individual investors into a kind of broker for themselves. There is no need to call your friend the stock broker and ask him what's hot today. You simply find it yourself. Some investors might enjoy this control; certainly an on-line broker gives you the option to ignore calls from your broker since you can place trades by yourself. <P>

StreetSmart has greater flexibility in placing orders on-line. Schwab has included the ability to place fill or kill, all or none, stop-limit contingency orders, and short-sales;  FOX users are not given these options. Both programs allow margin purchases and access to the mutual fund network. Purchases can be made from any fund in the Schwab fund network. Fidelity allows mutual fund exchanges, which cuts out a transaction from StreetSmart's program. Fidelity customers can directly exchange shares or set a dollar amount in one fund to match the same amount in another fund. <P>

Both programs offer the convenient flexibility to place your orders off-line then check them over before transmitting them to be executed. A complete menu of trading possibilities must be completed before sending the order to be executed. StreetSmart provides additional feedback to ensure proper order execution. Both programs also provide the flexibility to enter orders or transactions from other brokers into your portfolio account. You can track accounts like CDs, real estate, or stamp collections. When tracking these accounts, the programs act like stand-alone portfolio management programs. <P>

FOX features a menu selection to record non-Fidelity transactions, but StreetSmart requires a little maneuvering to add transactions manually. Since StreetSmart can only download 30 days worth of transactions, a menu choice exists to fill in the missing download periods. Users must manually enter every position that cannot be downloaded. The menus of StreetSmart offer about 20 investment choices as preset selections. The FOX account holding non-Fidelity investments can be classified as taxable, non-taxable (IRA/Keogh), or hypothetical to practice trading skills. <P>

In terms of overall usefulness, StreetSmart provides a much more useful and understandable menu for placing and executing trades. The buttons to pick are laid out well and all of your possible choices are presented as pre-programmed menu items. Figure 5 on p. 10 presents StreetSmart's screen choices when placing orders and a sample order confirmation screen. <P>


<STRONG>Additional Research</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

Before you start trading on-line, you might want to do some research on prospective investments. Fidelity and Schwab have created gateway access to other data services for this purpose. Both programs can access Dow Jones News/Retrieval and S&P MarketScope data. Fidelity offers a tie-in to Telescan data service [reviewed by Mark Fister in the March/April 1994 issue of CI]. <P>

As a bonus to new FOX users, Telescan is offering a 30-day free trial to users who dial in through the Fidelity link. Telescan offers expanded information sources, the ability to screen a broad universe of securities on both technical and fundamental data items, and technical analysis features. <P>

Schwab users can retrieve a detailed company report on over 6,700 companies compiled from sources like Standard & Poor's, Market Guide, Inc., and Zack's. New StreetSmart users receive one company report free, but subsequent reports cost $4.50 each. <P>

FOX users also can access data directly from Fidelity. Users can retrieve a historical performance evaluation on all Fidelity funds as well as information on other Fidelity accounts. These fund reports are free of charge excluding your on-line time to retrieve them. <P>


<STRONG>Unique Features</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

While FOX and StreetSmart have many similar features, there are unique items that distinguish the programs from each other. <P>

Fidelity On-line Xpress has an asset analyzer feature that enables users to track the performance of their assets either on an individual or group basis. FOX analyzes assets on a tax-lot basis, which means every purchase is allocated a specific lot that remains independent of the group of assets. This is useful in analyzing capital gains holding periods and finding a basis for shares owned. <P>

An analysis of a tax lot for a particular mutual fund can show reinvested gains on originally purchased shares. Select either all the tax lots associated with one fund to measure overall performance of your investment or select one specific purchase price lot to see the performance over a specified period. <P>

StreetSmart offers graphing capabilities for the securities you are tracking. Several graph types are available including: price history, asset allocation, return on investment, and realized/unrealized gains and losses. Color graphs can be created and printed from StreetSmart. StreetSmart utilizes the prices that you have retrieved through the regular quote service, so that if you are tracking a stock on a regular basis you can use those prices in more than one section of the program. <P>

Reporting on your holdings is slightly different with each program. FOX calls them security details reports while StreetSmart calls them views. Both programs can create a Schedule D customized gain and loss report. Users are able to customize reports or views in each program and the details can be arranged in similar fashion. <P>


<STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG>
<HR WIDTH=25% ALIGN=LEFT ><P>

I found both programs to be extremely easy to set up and use. Both provided quick access to accounts held at either Schwab or Fidelity. While both programs provide useful information and some further analysis, for serious investors, rather than just trackers, the programs do not go deep enough. Tracking your investments through a direct link provides an easy way to keep up to date on your security holdings. This may be all that some investors need, but those looking for in-depth research and analysis will not be satisfied with these programs solely. <P>

Since StreetSmart has a graphing capability, there is additional utility in using this program. Also, I found StreetSmart easier to use than Fidelity On-line Xpress because of the Windows layout. Fidelity promises a Windows setup for FOX in early 1995, but until then there is only the DOS version, which hindered me when trying to force it into a Windows environment. StreetSmart has refined their Windows version to a 1.0c and has just released a Macintosh version. <P>

Overall, I found both programs very useful in providing basic account transactions, balances, and price quotes. Tying into other data services is a good feature, but these are premium services that cost extra. StreetSmart stands out as the more polished performer with a broader array of features. Fidelity, however, provides a complete transaction history for every security associated with your accounts. <P>

I felt more at ease placing trades on StreetSmart because of the multiple checks and easy selection, but Fidelity offers greater flexibility for mutual fund transactions. I would recommend buying FOX if you have a Fidelity account and buying StreetSmart if you trade with Schwab. Both continue to expand their offers of no transaction fees on over 200 mutual funds each and access to purchase over 800 funds. <P>

The discount broker and the mutual fund giant have proven again why they are the service leaders in the brokerage industry. You won't be disappointed with the performance of these programs; however, if you don't have an account with either company, Schwab has the current edge with their Windows and Mac software. <P>
