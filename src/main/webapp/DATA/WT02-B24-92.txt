<BLOCKQUOTE>
<h2>Self-Esteem</h2>

<p>Treat your child as a whole person. Do not dwell on the problem. Help
them develop the same behaviors that you expect from other children.

<p>Help your child understand his or her disability and put it in perspective.
The more you accept that L.D. is just part of the individual, the more
the person can accept him or herself.

<p>Never let the disability become an excuse for not trying. Allow your
child to try, and even fail sometimes, since that's what life is also like.

<p>Involve your children in decision making. This can be anything from
deciding which watermelon to pick to choosing a vacation route. Allow them
to make the small decisions so they will be ready for the big ones. 
<br>

<h2>Social/Emotional</h2>

<p>Teach your child the rules of polite behavior, such as a good
handshake, the importance of eye contact, to wait until another has
stopped before speaking. 

<p>Share your own feelings with your children. Telling them, &quot;I am
angry.&quot; &quot;I am worried&quot;, &quot;I am happy&quot;, helps him/
her understand how faces and bodies look when someone is feeling a certain
way.

<p>Help your children participate in clubs or activities so they can
develop skills in areas along with others. Avoid too many extra-curricular
activities that create undue competition. Choose activities that will
help build self esteem and that may someday help with career choices. 

<br>

<h2>Self-Help</h2>

<p>Teach good grooming. Pick a hair style that is easy to comb; choose
color coordinated clothes, and then teach how to take care of clothes and
personal items.

<p>Help your child learn organizational skills. Start early with sorting
objects such as silverware. Plan for the next day the night before. Make
daily lists and plans. As skill increases, teach how a calendar is used
for planning ahead.

<p>Teach time management so he/she can learn to determine how long it will
take to get ready for class or a date. Help with developing a weekly schedule.
Color code different times, i.e. Green - study time, Blue - T.V., Red -
classes etc.

<p>Teach or find someone to teach such skills as telling time, how to prepare
food, basic car maintenance, to answer the phone, take messages, balance
a checkbook. Think of things you have to be able to do. Pick one skill
and teach it. Then pick another. In other words, teach your child the skills
needed to live independently. 

<p>Subscribe to appropriate magazines and publications that will keep him
or her updated on current clothing, movies, music, etc. 

<br>

<h2>Academic</h2>

<p>Keep copies of all school and psychological reports. You may need them
later to get services for your child.

<p>Don't become overly involved in the child's homework. Guidance and support
is needed but it is difficult to be both parent and teacher.

<p>If your child wants a college education start to investigate college
programs in his/her freshman year. It will take time and good programs
fill early. Help him/her ask good questions about the programs provided.

<p>Encourage students to volunteer at a nursing home, your church or  
synagogue, or with an environmental group. Such places are non-threatening
and help develop social skills.

<p>If he or she has chosen a vocation instead, consider having a career
counselor help with the decisions. There are also programs to help the
student in on the job training. 

<p>Never limit your children. Don't tell them they can't enter an occupation
because of the disability. There are more and more opportunities developing
for people with learning disabilities.

<p>Involve yourself. Find out about local, state and national conferences.
They are good sources of information and literature. So is the library.
Find support groups such as LDA. The more you know, the more effectively
you can help your child.
