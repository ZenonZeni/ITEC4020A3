</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><B>Section 232 Investigations:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>  Section 232 refers to a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, which authorizes the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) to conduct investigations to determine the impact of imports on national security.  Typically such investigations are initiated as the result of a petition from industry.  A 232 investigation is similar to other BXA research assessments, as a survey is devised and data collected from the industrial sector in question.  The final report, which includes findings and recommendations, is submitted to the President no later than 270 days after the date of initiation.  Should the assessment determine that imports represent a threat to national security, the President then has 90 days to determine whether to use his Section 232 statutory authority to "adjust imports."<P>

BXA has conducted a number of Section 232 investigations resulting in Presidential action to negotiate voluntary restraint agreements with Japan and Taiwan for machine tools, impose "Buy America" restrictions for military-use antifriction bearings, and most recently, authorizing a $30 million collaborative research and development initiative between the domestic semiconductor ceramic packaging industry and the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), to cite several examples.<P>

Section 232 Investigations have been completed on the following industries; click on any title to read a brief summary of the study:</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>

The Effect of Imports of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products on the National Security<BR>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>(PB 95-101382) February 1995 - Price $95
</CENTER><P></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>

At the request of the Independent Petroleum Association of America and several other industry associations, the Department of Commerce/Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) conducted an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effect of imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products on U.S. national security.  The report found that since the previous Section 232 Petroleum finding in 1988<I> (see Effects of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum Product Imports on the National Security, January 1989)</I>, there had been some improvement in U.S. energy security.  The breakup of the Soviet Union and the apparent disarray within OPEC have enhanced U.S. energy security.  Lower oil prices on balance have benefitted the U.S. economy.  However, factors leading toward a contraction of the U.S. petroleum industry and, as a result, a growing import dependence, led BXA to find that petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.<P>

The Effect of Imports of Ceramic Semiconductor Packages on the National Security<BR>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> 
(PB 93-192441) August 1993 - Price $95</CENTER><P></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>

At the request of Coors Electronic Package Company and Ceramic Process Systems Corporation, the Department of Commerce/Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) conducted an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effect of imports of ceramic semiconductor packages on the national security.  The report is an economic assessment of the U.S. ceramic semiconductor package industry.  It notes that from a military perspective, ceramic packages are a key component of the microelectronic element of virtually every U.S. military system.  Defense products account for about 20 percent of all ceramic packages used in the United States.  The investigation found that the U.S. industry suffered declines in profitability, capacity, capacity utilization, investment and employment between 1990 and 1992.  The report concluded that conditions in the ceramic package industry did not present an immediate threat to national security, but improving the capabilities of the domestic industry was deemed desirable for both economic and national security reasons.<P>

The Effect of Imports of Gears and Gearing Products on the National Security<BR>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> 
(PB 93-192466) July 1992 - Price $95</CENTER><P></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>

At the request of the American Gear Manufacturers Association, the Department of Commerce/Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) conducted an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effect of imports of gears and gearing products on the national security.  The report was created following a comprehensive mandatory survey of the domestic industry.   <P>

The report is an economic assessment of the U.S. gear industry.  It notes that gears are critical to the U.S. industrial base and are essential to both the construction and performance of nearly all weapon systems and commercial machinery and equipment of all types.  The report examines the ability of the domestic industry to meet the defense needs of the U.S., as well as the extent of U.S. dependence on foreign sourced gears and production equipment.  It concluded that "it is important for the U.S. to maintain a competitive and technologically viable domestic gear production base."  BXA found that gear imports did not represent a threat to U.S. national security.  However, BXA encouraged the Department of Defense to carefully consider the national security issued raised in the report and continue its significant effort to support defense-critical gear industry research. <P>
