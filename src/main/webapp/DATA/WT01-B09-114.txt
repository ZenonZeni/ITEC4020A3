<B>Project Title: SmartCoolTM Air Conditioning System ­ S­10 Electric Pick­up<p>

Performing Organization: Smart Power Systems</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: Gregg Peterson, (810) 682­0203</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The project objective is to develop a high­efficiency, lightweight air conditioning system for
electric passenger vehicles. The system is based on a new two­stage centrifugal compressor with an integral DC
brushless permanent magnet motor designed by Smart Power Systems. The system uses a low pressure
environmentally friendly refrigerant; system pressures are typically 15 psi to 30 psi. The nominal design output is
18,000 BTU/hr; the maximum design capacity is 21,000 BTU/hr. The theoretical compressor input power at 18,000
BTU/hr capacity is less than 1,400 watts at the ASHRAE high­efficiency rating point. Input power is substantially
reduced as a function of ambient conditions. As an example, modeling the system at the ASHRAE SEER rating
point yields an output of over 8,000 BTU/hr using less than 400 watts of compressor input power.</P>

<P>The SmartCool centrifugal compressor weights under 10 pounds and is 30% smaller than similar capacity electric
R134a compressors. </P>

<P>A microprocessor continuously monitors and controls all system parameters with millisecond response times and
ensures that the compressor is operating at its highest efficiency at all times. Computer­controlled functions
include compressor motor speed, condenser fan speed, and expansion valve setting. The compressor will be
mounted in the vehicle motor compartment; the refrigerant lines will be routed through the front of dash. The
existing HVAC module will be updated with a SmartCool compatible evaporator and condenser. The evaporator
blower and condenser fan will be production Chevrolet units. The system will utilize production HVAC controls and
related hardware wherever possible. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P><P>A 240 VDC SmartCool compressor, related electronics, and heat exchangers will be
installed on a Solectria E­10 pick­up and evaluated starting this September. The objective is to improve the vehicle
range.
</P>
<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P><P>QTR3 1996 installation target ­ performance evaluations and engineering enhancements to
continue through the end of the contract.
