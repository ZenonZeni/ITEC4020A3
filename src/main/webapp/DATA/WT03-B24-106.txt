<Title>David Lesher's Comments on the Meeting </title>
</head>
<body>


I (<a href="mailto:wb8foz@nrk.com">David Lesher</a>) attended the NIST Key Escrow conference this week. Here are my
impressions.
<p>
In theory, NSA/NIST scheduled it to seek consensus from industry on
how to set up a Gov't Access to Keys (hereafter GAK) program they'd
be happy with. The bait was, NSA would allow export of same.

<p>
The rub was, NSA attempted to set all the ground rules before
starting. They had ten conditions any proposal had to meet.
(http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/criteria.txt) With the rules 
<a href="../crypto/topic3.html">available on-line,</a> 
I'll not duplicate them all. But #1 is roughly:

<p>
	unclassified algorithm NTE 64 bits.

<p>
and #10:

<p>
	Only key agents sanctioned by USG. Sanctioning
	by formal agreements "consistent with US law enforcement
	and National Security requirements."

<p>
The conference was attended by I'd guess 150 Industry Bigwigs.  LOTS
of expensive suits ;-}. There were also more declared NSA types than
I'd ever seen before anywhere outside the Fort. Specific names I saw:
(and no, I can't spell...)

<p><pre>
	Win Diffe of Sun
	D. Denning
	Stuart Baker, late of NSA
	Lance Hoffman of GWU
	Carl Ellison of TIS
	Edward Scheidt of TECSEC
</pre>
<p>
It opened with speeches by Ed Roback & Ray Kammer of NIST.  The meat
started with Michael Nelson of the White House. He attempted to
justify the GAK policies but did not appear to make any converts.  He
made (IMHO) denigrating remarks about trusting ~"code from the 'Net'
with your secrets" but evaded questions about why anyone would trust
keys given to other governments...

<p>
(Prevailing throughout the conference was a dichotomy.  The official
justification for the conference was "export use" but when questions
arose the specter of the 4 Horsemen of the Net-Apocalypse came up
again and again.)

<p>
Then the meeting broke up into working groups.  Each group discussed
some subset of the 10 rules then reported back to the whole. We
actually did this three times.  Intermixed with this were various
presentations. (See the www site.)

<p>
At best, the working groups came back with no suggestions; at
worst they returned in open revolt.

<p>
The end result was a parsec wide gap between industry & NSA.
Seemingly EVERY speaker the second day prefaced his/her remarks with
some form of "Do not assume our presence here is an endorsement,
because it is NOT.." The Merrill-Lynch VP representing the
securities industry association saw nothing to take back to his
members.

<p>
But it was Robert Holleyman, President of the Business Software
Alliance who drew the biggest standing ovation. (<a href="./bsa.html">
Read his paper on the WWW site.</a>)
 His closing sentence seemed to say it all:
<p>
<i>	Instead of paving the roads, the Administration has left
in place roadblocks on the Information Highway.
</i>
<p>
Everyone who mentioned it felt the FIPS meeting planned for the
15th was premature at best.
