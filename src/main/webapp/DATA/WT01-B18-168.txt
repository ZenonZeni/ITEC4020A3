<H3>3. New England DSM Successes</H3>


In 1990, New England Electric System earned $8.3 million, a 12 percent 
return, on DSM programs. By 1991, New England utilities' DSM expenditures 
had increased to about $300 million annually, with the majority of those 
expenditures targeted for energy efficiency rather than load management. 
These investments have resulted in significant economic, environmental, 
and energy-security benefits. For example, in 1991, utility DSM 
investments in New England:<P>
<ul>
 <li>     were saving 2,169 gigawatt-hours of energy annually, enough to 
heat and power the New Haven metropolitan area;<p>
 <li>     produced energy-efficiency improvements that will lower net 
electric bills by approximately $250 million over their life cycle;<p>
 <li>     saved the equivalent of 3.7 million barrels of oil;<p>
 <li>     avoided emissions of 11,800 metric tons of sulfur dioxide;<p>
 <li>     avoided emissions of 5,000 metric tons of nitrogen oxides; 
and,<p>
 <li>     avoided emissions of 1.8 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide.<a href="#101" name="r101"> [ 101 ] </a>
</ul>
<p>     Three of the largest utilities in Massachusetts have worked 
collaboratively with environmental and consumer groups to design and 
implement DSM programs. From 1990 through 1993, investments in DSM by 
these utilities grew, such that by 1993, DSM outlays reached 5 percent of 
annual utility retail revenues. During that four-year period, investments 
totaled $540 million, including both utility and participant costs, for 
measures that produced energy savings at an average life-cycle cost of 3.8 
cents per kilowatt-hour. The life-cycle savings total 14,091 
gigawatt-hours and provide 267 megawatts of summer peak reductions. Carbon 
dioxide reductions over the life cycle of the measures total 9.3 million 
metric tons.<a href="#102" name="r102"> [ 102 ] </a>In 1994, the DSM programs of these three utilities 
accounted for about 3 percent of customer energy requirements. The net 
value of customer savings exceeded $843 million, including environmental 
benefits ($398 million if environmental externalities are excluded). The 
energy-efficiency investments have helped to defer investments in 
additional capacity.<a href="#103" name="r103"> [ 103 ] </a>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="NewEnglandElectricSystem">New England Electric System<a></B>.</I> In 1987, New England 
Electric System, which comprises three utilities - 
<B><I><A NAME="MassachusettsElectricCompany">Massachusetts Electric Company<a>, 
<A NAME="NarragansettElectric">Narragansett Electric<a>,</B></I> and 
<B><I><A NAME="GraniteStateElectric">Granite State Electric<a></B></I> - 
initiated its "Design 2000" program, which focuses 
on implementing efficiency upgrades at the time customers install new 
electrical equipment during the normal course of business. These "time 
dependent" opportunities occur during new construction, renovation, and 
when failed equipment is replaced. Design 2000 pays essentially all 
out-of-pocket expenses associated with the efficiency upgrades, which 
include lighting, motors and drives, HVAC upgrades, food-service and 
industrial-process improvements, and custom measures that employ emerging 
technologies - and then provides the participant with lower electricity 
bills. Energy savings from 1993 efficiency upgrades alone were 28,972 
megawatt-hours (saving 15,935 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions), 
while the life-cycle savings of the measures installed in that year will 
be 416,276 megawatt-hours (a carbon dioxide emissions reduction of 228,952 
metric tons). Cumulatively since 1989, 66,220 megawatt-hours have been 
saved (preventing 36,421 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions), while 
the life-cycle energy savings of upgrades to date will be 923,374 
megawatt-hours (avoiding carbon dioxide emissions of 530,017 metric tons). 
The Design 2000 program has saved New England Electric 14.16 megawatts of 
new capacity at a total, cumulative program cost of $21.3 million.<a href="#104" name="r104"> [ 104 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="BurlingtonElectricDepartment"> Burlington Electric Department</a></B>.</I> Burlington has 
served the residents of Burlington, Vermont with a mix of electricity and 
energy-efficiency services since the late 1970s. At that time, it 
responded to the oil shocks by introducing its first energy-efficiency 
programs. More recently, local concerns over power purchases from 
Hydro-Quebec and its controversial James Bay development prompted 
Burlington voters to pass an $11 million bond issue to catalyze DSM 
programs. The utility introduced a "Smartlight" leasing program for 
compact fluorescent lamps, and promoted a program to convert electric 
resistance heating to other fuels in order to reduce winter peak load. Six 
other programs offer customers a comprehensive package of DSM options. 
Cumulative energy savings from 1991 through 1993 totaled 33,944 
megawatt-hours (preventing 2,444 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions), 
and over the life cycle of these installations will save 290,183 
megawatt-hours (preventing 20,893 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions).<a href="#105" name="r105"> [ 105 ] </a>
