Anadarko buys Hugoton reserves

         Anadarko Petroleum has signed
an agreement to purchase deep producing
oil and gas properties in the Hugoton
area of southwest Kansas.
         Anadarko would not say who it
was purchasing the properties from
because of an agreement with the
operator, but the $20 million deal is
expected to close by June 15. About 60%
of the reserves are crude oil.
         Anadarko expects average net
production of about 1.4 million cfd of
gas and about 500 barrels of oil per
day, to be marketed under short-term
contracts.

PG&E pursues first regional
electronic hub

         SAN FRANCISCO -- In what
could develop into the first regional
electronic marketing hub, Pacific Gas &
Electric (PG&E) is pursuing the
development of an electronic energy
marketplace (EEM) by as early as 1996
that would allow all segments of the
industry from Alberta to the Southwest
to come together and conduct business
on one electronic system.
         "It's in the conceptualization
stage," Kenneth Hamkik, PG&E's director
of strategic planning, told Gas Markets
Week. "That means what we're trying to
do is look at the long term in relation
to what's happening in 1993 with the
implementation of Order 636 and FERC
trying to push standardization," he
said.
         "It's a marketplace," said
Hamik, "and a marketplace implies that
you have multiple players that can come
together on a single log-in, in this
case, and have the ease of use to be
able to do business in a number of new
ways," he said.
         Along with Southern California
Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric, which
both agree with the concept of an EEM,
according to Hamik, PG&E may be
starting what could be called a local
distribution company (LDC) revolution
in the gas industry.
         Hamik said with all the
competition going on in the pipeline
segment of the industry with their
proprietary electronic bulletin boards
(EBBs), seeds are starting to be sown
with the LDCs to make sense of the
chaos. He said LDCs want to get in
front of EBB developments and form an
electronic marketplace where they get
full benefit of the business
opportunities out there.
         He said it will probably have
to start on the regional level and "the
LDCs should at least have a heavy-
handed influence to help shape this."
Hamik said pipelines won't be excluded
in the process, but LDCs will benefit
the most from regional EEMs.
         Hamik said the EEM will go
beyond the traditional posting systems
of EBBs, "Technology is not the
barrier," Hamik said, "There's a lot of
vendors that have already started to
present Windows-based products where
you don't have to know boo about
computers," he added.
         And one of those vendors
working on the West Coast EEM is
Interactive Images, headed by the
former manager of Enron's information
systems Robert Hadlow. Hadlow said with
the free market environment evolving
from Order 636, the West Coast natural
gas industry is going to need an EEM
that will serve as a common electronic
hub through which all segments of the
industry can conduct their daily
business. He said the system will need
to be quick, easy to use and users
should be able to work across multiple
companies.
         Hadlow said the EEM will
differ from EBBs in that it will
initiate and approve transactions
through the entire daisy chain of
transactions on behalf of all the
customers it serves. Through the EEM,
Hadlow said, from producer to end-user,
including futures and secondary market
players, all users will be able to
conduct business across multiple
companies as if those companies were
one.
         He said the EEM will not
replace each industry segment's
internal proprietary systems, but it
will replace their EBBs with a single,
common system for the West Coast
market.
         PG&E's Hamik said the first
phase of developing the West Coast EEM
was identifying the landscape. "What
are the baby steps or maybe even some
of the big leaps we need to start
taking now in order to bridge the
future with the present?"
          Hamik said when developing
the scenario for the implementation of
the EEM, PG&E looked at the banking and
airline industries as an example of how
fast the EEM could be developed.
         He said one company can't make
the EEM happen. It will have to be a
consortium. "The marketplace has to be
open or it's not going to work," said
Hamik. He said PG&E has talked to 20 to
25 different companies and the answer
it's received have been "yes" to the
EEM, but opinions differ on how it's
going to happen. Hamik said some
companies are "bearish" on the issue of
having the EEM up and running by the
end of the decade.
         "I don't get involved in
projects that don't happen within the
decade," was Hadlow's response. Hadlow
also said he is in the process of
estimating the cost of the project but
no firm figures are available yet.
         Hadlow proposed a possible
timeline for the implementation of the
West Coast EEM:
         % 1994: PG&E's system
operational for transactions;
         % 1995: Multi-company access
available;
         % 1996: Some cross-company
transaction capabilities;
         % 1997: West Coast EEM fully
operational;
         % 1998: Links to other
regional EEMs achieved;
         % 1999: North American EEM
fully operational.
         For more information on the
West Coast EEM, contact Hadlow at 415-
885-0278.

Buyers position themselves for
cold weekend

         Prices were up everywhere on
Thursday -- Gulf Coast, Midcontinent
and West Texas -- as buyers wanted to
ensure they had a supplier for what was
expected to be a winter-like weekend.
         Sellers limited sales to one
day only in most cases, playing for
more time and more threats of chilling
temperatures to push prices up another
few pennies Friday through Monday.
         The exception was West Texas
where California buyers are having to
compete with gas going to Texas
intrastate markets and gas headed north
into the mouth of the cold front.
Buyers and sellers were negotiating
deals for Saturday through Tuesday, but
talks were in a very narrow range for
both swing and four-day deals.
         Sellers asked $2.02 and buyers
tried to keep the lid on at $2.00 even,
up from $1.91-95 Wednesday. A marketer
bought a four-day deal at $2.00, while
another marketer sold Saturday only
packages at $2.00-01 and was working on
wrapping up some four-day deals.
         Gulf Coast Louisiana prices
ranged from $2.32-34 for most sales
into Columbia, with a high of $2.35, up
from a high of $2.30 the day before.
There was only a penny spread between
equity sales and marketers' resales,
said one source.
         Texas Eastern at East
Louisiana was $2.30-33. A marketer sold
5 million at the Transco Station 65
pooling point at $2.30. A marketer
bought 50 million cfd on Texas Gas SL
at $2.35, up from a high of $2.30 a day
earlier.
         Midcontinent prices jumped to
$2.05-09 on Panhandle Eastern for
purchases, while sales topped at $2.10.
Wednesday's Panhandle gas topped out at
$2.02. One buyer turned back Panhandle
gas at $2.10, however, while a buyer on
Arkla resisted a $2.10 price and got
the seller to come down to $2.07.
Marketers bought a range of $2.06-09 on
Arkla, up from $2.04-08 the day before.
         Houston Ship Channel prices
jumped to $2.28 Thursday up from $2.22-
25 earlier in the week. Katy prices,
which had moved up earlier, stayed flat
at $2.20-24 Thursday, with one price
reported at $2.25.
         South Texas prices ranged from
$2.15-22 on Texas Eastern on the mid-
Gulf Coast. A package of 10 million cfd
was sold into Koch Gateway in the same
area at $2.24, competing with prices
into Houston Pipe Line at $2.19-20, up
from a previous high of $2.17. A
package in deep south Texas went for
$2.15, and packages were was sold into
Tejas Natural Gas near Agua Dulce at
$2.17-18.
         Meanwhile, Permian and San
Juan basin prices rebounded on at mid-
week from a low Tuesday of at least
$1.84 back to $1.90 and above for
Friday deals.
         Swing prices into El Paso
Natural Gas had dropped last Monday and
Tuesday for a combination of reasons. A
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) gas-fired
power plant went down early in the
week, causing some loss of gas demand,
although two smaller gas-fired units
were brought on line by the utility,
said a source, PG&E did cut 100
million-140 million cfd.
         The utility also picked up
some cheaper supplies out of Canada,
displacing more supplies out of the
Permian and San Juan. Another source
said PG&E had to turn back 70 million
of baseload gas because of an
operational problem. Southern
California Gas (SoCal) also cut about
80 million of swing last Monday, said a
source.
         But all that turned around
Wednesday, PG&E will be bringing the
big power plant back on line Saturday
and the baseload supplies will be
flowing again tomorrow, said a
marketer.
         A California utility on
Wednesday was trying to buy gas in the
Permian to flow Thursday through
Tuesday at $1.90 into El Paso. The
company apparently was trying to do the
five-day deals to lock up supplies
before a predicted cold front was
expected to swoop into Texas this past
weekend. A supplier said his company's
weather report had predicted
temperatures would drop to 35 in
Houston Sunday.
         "The smart seller will sell
his gas one day at a time starting at
$1.90-92 for Friday," said a supplier
late last week. "Then he'll get better
prices for Saturday through Tuesday."

First day of Order 636 operation
seen as smooth

         A number of pipelines
completed the transition to operating
under Order 636 last week and officials
were generally saying "so far, so
good."
         Officials at Koch Gateway
Pipeline, Pacific Gas Transmission,
Mississippi River Transmission,
Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia
Gulf Transmission and Northwest
Pipeline all said the transition was
going smoothly. Others scheduled to
implement Order 636 yesterday included
Northern Natural Gas, Viking Gas
Transmission, Southern Natural Gas,
Texas Gas Transmission and ANR
Pipeline.
         "Considering the number of new
services and the magnitude of the
changes that we've had to implement,
we've been pleased with the initial
month's nominiations process and
pleased with our first day operating
under Order 636," said a Columbia Gas
official. "We are experiencing the
typical minor bugs and startup problems
that you would expect under such a big
change, but there's nothing that we're
overly concerned about, that we won't
be able to work out," he added.
                  Joe Pollard, director
of transportation services for Great
Lakes, said the pipeline began its
capacity release and flexible receipt
and delivery point programs today, and
there's been no major trouble. There
have been a number of assignments,
releases and conversions as part of the
transition, but everything has gone
smoothly, he added.
         Pacific Gas Transmission (PGT)
had the fullest plate yesterday, as it
began operations under Order 636 and
began transporting expansion volumes.
According to a spokesperson, the
pipeline also started its electronic
bulletin board and had its first
capacity releases.
         The expansion allows PGT to
transport more than 2.4 billion cfd to
the Pacific Northwest and California.
Total PGT volumes were running about
1.6 billion cfd yesterday, and the
contracted expansion volumes of about
900 million cfd were about 70% full,
the spokesperson said. About 340
million cfd of the total system volumes
were moving under interruptible
contracts, he added.
         "We're very pleased to have
reached our goal on schedule," said
Stephen Reynolds, PGT president and
CEO. "Getting from blueprints to
reality on a project of this magnitude
required an incredible amount of
groundwork and follow-through."
         On a related note, Alberta &
Southern Gas ceased buying and selling
gas yesterday after more than 30 years.
Alberta & Southern transported about
9.5 trillion cf of gas through a long-
term contract with PGT to California.
         San Diego Gas & Electric
reported no problems so far early last
week getting its first volumes from the
PGT expansion.
         San Diego is getting about 54
million cfd of gas off the expanded
line from four Calgary suppliers: Bow
Valley Industries, Canadian Hunter
Marketing, Summit Resources and Husky
Oil Operations.
         The contracts range from eight
to 11 years, with prices indexed to the
market. According to SDG&E's latest 10-
K, future minimum payments under the
Canadian deals are forecast to be $6
million in 1993. $36 million in 199,
$38 million in 1995, $40 million in
1996, $42 million in 1997 and $281
million thereafter.
         For the remainder of its spot
gas for November, San Diego received
more than 180 bids from 45 companies
for a total 1.8 billion cfd.
         The utility accepted 15 bids
from 11 companies for a total of about
160 million cfd. About 85 million of
that came from the San Juan Basin on El
Paso Natural Gas, 27 million was bought
into Transwestern Pipeline in the
Permian Basin and the central zone at
station 8. Another 48 million was
bought at the border, and 10 million
cfd of spot gas came from Canada.
         As of the end of October, San
Diego's storage allotments were full,
the buyers added.

Centran creditors could be repaid
this year

         The old Centran has a new
name, a new parent and a new balance
sheet, and creditors of the
Minneapolis-based marketer might be
paid part of what they are owed by the
end of the year.
         Northern States Power (NSP)
christened the marketer "Cenergy" late
last month after acquiring most of the
assets Oct. 1. Cenergy "has had capital
infused" by the new parent, explained
Vice President Bruce Hoffarber, but
otherwise has its own relationship with
regional bank Norwest.
         It appears the financing of
Cenergy will have to be separate from
its parent. In general, public
utilities in Minnesota are not allowed
to finance their unregulated
subsidiaries, explained Bob Harding, a
rates analyst at the state Public
Utility Commission.
         NSP's creation of Cenergy and
acquisition of Viking Gas Transmission
will be examined by the commission in
the future, Harding added.
         Hoffarber said Centran was
marketing about 70 million cfd in
October, and Cenergy is doing 100
million cfd of business in November. He
added that Cenergy cannot do business
with NSP Gas.
         Meanwhile, the creditors
committee of Centran has hired a
liquidator, Jim Bartholomew, to dispose
of the estate of what is now a paper
entity. And sources said a plan to
divide the remaining assets is expected
to be filed with the federal bankruptcy
court in Minneapolis by next week.
         The assets would include the
purchase price of $2.2 million paid for
Centran, another $235,000 from the sale
of a gathering system, revenues from
the sale of a coal company and a grain
elevator and other cash. Also, NSP will
pay another $250,000 on Jan. 17 as part
of a "holdback" in the deal.
         Bartholomew's job is to
collect any accounts still receivable
by Centran and eventually make
distributions, said Charles Hofer,
credit manager at Trident NGL and
chairman of the creditors committee.
         Creditors and a judge have to
approve the plan before any
disbursements, but Hofer said he
expects most of the funds to be
distributed at year's end, some in
March 1994 and some a year later.
         He told Gas Daily that he
expects creditors to get 20-30 cents on
the dollar. "We did not leave the
decisions to the lawyers," he said. "We
were very aware of the costs that could
eat up a  bankruptcy and tried to limit
the administrative expense."
         One of the smaller creditors
that wasn't involved on the committee
said it expects to get $50,000 to
$60,000, but is not optimistic about
getting it soon.
         Centran was the first of a
number of marketers that filed for
court protection from creditors this
year.

Indiana utility fights 20-year cap

         FERC's order refusing Texas
Gas Transmission's proposed 10-year cap
on contracts with its customers is
unlawful, according to Indiana Gas.
         A cap maximizes the number of
years specific types of contracts can
be bargained for. The commission chose
to keep Texas Gas customer contracts
capped at 20 years.
         Indiana Gas said last month's
order is "unwise" and "highly
contradictory" considering commission
comments in a previous FERC order.
         FERC stated in July, "We
believe the 10-year cap proposed by
Texas Gas is a reasonable compromise
between the 20-year maximum and the
three to five-year caps proposed by the
commentors."
         The utility said the
commission's final decision was
"unsupported by substantial evidence of
record" and that 20 years is an
"excessive time period given the
dynamic nature of the gas market which
exists today."
         Indiana Gas noted that only
one commentor, Fuel Managers
Associates, opposed the 10-year cap,
and, to the best of Indiana Gas'
knowledge, no member of the association
is currently a Texas Gas customer. "It
would be unreasonable to shackle Texas
Gas customers with a 20-year contract
cap simply because someone alleges
potential future customers desire a
longer term."  (RS92-24).

SoCal gets active in refinancing

         Holders of SoCal Gas' Series X
first mortgage bonds will have to
accept a lower yield if they decide to
sell them back to the utility in an
offer announced last week. But the high
coupon bonds may have a limited life
anyway, since the utility can call them
Dec. 1, 1995.
         SoCal Gas will buy any and all
of its $120 million of 9.75% first
mortgage bonds due 2020, but the offer
expires Nov. 10. The purchase price for
the bond will be determined by using a
yield to the maturity of the U.S.
Treasury 5.125% notes due Nov. 15,
1995, plus 0.15% and accrued interest.

Gulf Coast indexes up 5-10 cents
for November

         Gas Daily's Monthly Contract
Indexes for November along the Gulf
Coast were up 5-10 cents while most
Midcontinent indexes dropped a penny,
setting the stage for what many sources
are expecting for next month -- higher
after-market prices.
         The November index for
supplies into Texas Gas Transmission
jumped 11 cents over the October index
to $2.08, the biggest increase this
month in south Louisiana. The index for
supplies into Columbia Gulf
Transmission finished at $2.11, up 7
cents.
         November indexes for
Midcontinent volumes into ANR Pipeline,
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line and Natural
Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) each
fell a penny. The Panhandle and ANR
indexes finished at $1.90, while the
NGPL was $1.87 in Oklahoma. The index
for volumes into Northern Natural Gas
in the field climbed 3 cents, while the
indexes into Northern at Ventura and at
the demarcation point each dropped a
penny to $1.89. Firm transportation
rates under Order 636 allowed buyers to
pay higher prices in the field while
getting lower prices at Ventura and at
the demarcation point, sources said.
         The November index for
supplies into El Paso Natural Gas in
the Permian Basin was unchanged from
October to November, remaining at
$1.80. Those who sold baseload supplies
during bid week were probably
regretting that by the end of last week
as swing prices climbed above $2.

FERC commissioners get up to speed
on GISB

         Industry officials
representing the Gas Industry Standards
Board (GISB) took a seat before the
FERC commissioners yesterday to answers
questions on the board's progress
before its debut next September.
         The panel said the scope will
probably be narrow at first and the
target date for an up and running GISB
is Sept. 1, 1994.
         After a general rundown of
developments so far of GISB, FERC
Commissioner Donald Santa asked the
representatives to explain the
jurisdictional tie between the
standards the board may come up with
and FERC's responsibilities under the
Natural Gas Act.
         Marvin Clifton with Mobil
Natural Gas answered they didn't know
the answer to that question but the
board's attorneys could provide FERC
with the answer.
         On the same track as Santa,
FERC Chair Elizabeth Moler said issues
that GISB proposes to take up in its
second generation such as the
definition of gas day, notice
requirements, nominations and systems
balancing "are all directly FERC
jurisdictional items and will require
changes in FERC tariffs."
         "To the extent the FERC has
jurisdiction over something and the
pipelines are required to make tariff
changes obviously they would proceed
and FERC would act accordingly," said
Consolidated Edison's Steve Salese.
         "We hope that what we would be
doing though is coming to the
commission with something that the
industry has said 'This is going to
work for us' just like we've done in
the working groups," said Salese.
         When asked by FERC
Commissioner Vickey Bailey about the
make up and management of GISB, Mike
Bray with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
said the board has gotten past the
initial criticism of its make up. Chuck
Linderman with the Edison Electric
Institute said if anyone feels left out
of the process, the question should be
asked of them, "Where were you?"
         Another criticism Bailey said
was being voiced is that GISB is just
another level of regulation for the gas
industry.
         Mobil's Clifton said, "If that
is true, then I would like to withdraw
my support for GISB." He said the
purpose of GISB is to get the industry
together to develop industry solutions.
Clifton stressed that GISB is not meant
to add regulation to the industry.

Mining company doesn't get rights

         The Alabama Supreme Court
ruled recently that the rights to drill
for gas in coalbeds do not belong to a
mining company.
         In a blow to the already
financially strapped mining company,
Jim Walter Resources is not entitled to
develop and sell the coalbed methane
gas that accumulates in an area of the
mine that houses mining refuse, ruled
the Alabama Supreme Court.
         The court said Jim Walter
Resources (JWR) may develop the coalbed
gas that is within the coal seam,
which, in any event, must be ventilated
for safety reasons. But once the
coalbed gas migrates out of the coal
seam and into the gob -- underground
coal dumping area -- the gas then
belongs to the holder of the gas
estate, the court ruled last month.
         The gob methane gas production
represents 70% of the gas captured from
the operation, which is then sold.
         The case stems from two
appeals to gain title to coalbed
methane gas on property in Tuscaloosa
County, Ala. JWR sought title to the
gas it has been selling in a
partnership with Sonat Coal Gas and
others. The company sued NCNB Nations
Bank of Texas to gain title of the
methane gas, and the bank counter-sued.
         The land that JWR is mining is
subject to 1953 and 1954 deeds, which
conveyed the property owner's interest
to the coal to what is now JWR, but
reserved the property owner's interest
in "all gas." NCNB is the trustee of
the estate, and owns a 22.5% interest
in all the gas reserved by the deed.
         The court had to decide
whether the deed, which conveyed all of
the coal and connected mining rights to
JWR, but reserved the rights to all of
the gas to the property owner, also
reserved the rights of the coalbed
methane gas to the property owner.
         In a jury trial, the lower
court determined that all of the gas
produced from the property was coalbed
gas and that none of the gas resided in
a non-coal area before mining.
         The court said the language in
the deeds in this case is unambiguous.
The deeds specifically reserve "all of
the oil, gas, petroleum and sulphur in,
on and under" the areas where JWR mines
to the property owner.
         Neither JWR nor the bank
dispute that the coalbed gas is "gas,"
and the court said it could find "no
scientific or legal basis to support
the proposition that coalbed methane
gas should be treated as a resource
separate and distinct from other
natural gas."
         However, the court added that
property law cases indicate that the
ownership of the gas depends upon the
location of the gas at the time it is
captured or located.

Curtis nominated by president

         The first chairman of FERC,
Charles Curtis, will get the tap as
under secretary of energy, President
Clinton said.
         If confirmed, Curtis will be
in charge of science and technology
programs, waste cleanup, nuclear
weapons programs and energy policy.
Thomas Grumbly, assistant secretary for
environmental restoration and waste
management, has been acting under
secretary.
         "There are few Americans who
can match Charles Curtis' governmental
experience, or his knowledge of energy
policy," the president said in his
announcement.
         At FERC, Curtis solidified a
reputation as scholarly and fair.
Curtis had served as chief counsel to
the House Energy Committee for five
years when President Carter nominated
him to be the last chairman of the
Federal Power Commission (FPC) in 1977.
         Under a separate nomination a
month later, Curtis became FERC's first
chairman. The new commission took over
all the FPC tasks, with the addition of
oil pipeline rate regulation and
deciding appeals from price control
hearings in the Energy Dept. He has
worked at the Securities and Exchange
Commission,  and is now a partner in
the Washington law firm of Van Ness,
Feldman & Curtis.

Amoco sets up trading room in
Houston

         Amoco is hoping to have its
new gas trading room operating in
February, the major's new natural gas
vice president told reporters last
week.
         "We may not be first but we
hope to have the best" gas trading
room, Rebecca McDonald, Amoco
Production's natural gas vice president
said. Amoco has learned from the
mistakes of others, she added, which
have already set up trading-type rooms
at other companies, including Tenneco,
where McDonald headed the marketing
division before coming to Amoco.
         About 80 out of the gas
division's 200 employees will work in
the Houston trading room where futures
traders, cash traders, transportation
representatives and gas control people
will be centralized, said McDonald.
         The trading room is a result
of customer meetings initiated by
McDonald seeking to expand the services
offered by the major.
         The customers wanted more
creative solutions to contracting with
financial hedging instruments something
some wanted Amoco's help with, McDonald
said.
         McDonald's hiring signifies
the "cultural change" at Amoco, which
has realized that the business of
natural gas is different than the
business of oil, according to Bill
Benham, Amoco's vice president of
regulatory affairs.
         Amoco wants to make sure it
gets the most for its natural gas
assets, Benham added, with a shift to
gas marketing signifying the commitment
the major now sees for natural gas.
         She added that Amoco plans to
buy even more gas from third parties
this winter and next year. Amoco now
buys about 250 million cfd to 300
million cfd from independents to add to
the major's portfolio. Amoco is asking
some producers to "double and triple"
their sales to it, contending that
selling to Amoco adds value to the
independents' gas.          DM

Sluggish demand expected to slow
1993 growth

         NEW ORLEANS -- Producers
have now lowered their expectations
that gas demand will again be strong
this year, with the Independent
Petroleum Assn. of America (IPAA)
predicting gas use will rise only about
1% to "just kiss 20 trillion cf."
         Gas demand has risen for the
last couple of years by about 3% a year
with the expectation by most in the
industry that gas use would continue to
grow at those levels this year as well.
         But IPAA's latest short-term
supply and demand outlook released
yesterday at its annual meeting shows
that gas demand may not even rise by 1%
this year, with the outlook only
slightly more optimistic for next year
when demand is expected to increase
1.4% and finally top the 20 trillion
cf/year level not seen since 1979. Gas
demand last year was 19.78 trillion cf.
         Increased electric generation
using hydropower and nuclear power was
the biggest factor for lower gas demand
this year, members of IPAA's supply and
demand committee told reporters
yesterday. IPAA's forecast shows that
gas use for electric generation this
year will likely fall by 4.7% and is
predicted to drop another 1.4% in 1994.
IPAA uses figures released from the
Energy Information Administration for
the first two quarters of this year as
a basis to predict gas demand for the
remaining half of the year.
         In addition, oil prices,
including residual fuel, were
significantly lower than expected and
industrial fuel-switching customers
chose resid over gas this year, IPAA
said. Higher natural gas prices this
year also contributed to the lower than
expected demand, said Larry Hilgers,
market and risk assessment manager for
Oryx, the committee's chairman.
         IPAA had predicted last year
that demand would be up as much as 3%
this year. Despite "limited" gas demand
growth, demand for coal is expected to
rise by 3% this year even with the
Mississippi River floods and strikes.
Hydropower use is seen rising by 5%
this year and nuclear powered
generation is also expected to be up by
2% in 1993, according to IPAA.
         "As soon as gas demand last
winter didn't materialize, we began to
suspect that we may have been too
optimistic last year," said Hilgers.
         Increased use of hydropower in
the Northwest and the West probably
took about 200 billion cfd and 300
billion cfd of gas demand away, Hilgers
added.
         Gas imports from Canada are
expected to slow this year to only a 5%
increase over last year to about 2.2
trillion cf/year. Canadian gas imports
increased by about 10% last year. IPAA
attributed the slowing Canadian import
growth to increased competition driving
the market.
         IPAA also predicted slowed gas
exports to Mexico by 11% to 192 billion
cf this year due to the change in the
relative price between gas and fuel
oil.          DM

U.S. Natural Gas Supply and Demand
-- 1993 Forecast
Producers target SoCal fee

         More major producers are
calling Southern California Gas'
(SoCal) fee to access one of its
pipeline interconnections "illegal and
discriminatory."
         Shell, Mobil, Texaco, along
with Pacific Gas & Electric, are just a
few of the new supporters of Union
Pacific's original allegations of
illegal fees.  The original
complaintants were Union Pacific Fuels,
Amoco Energy Trading, and Petro-Canada
Hydrocarbons.
         These shippers/producers are
asking FERC to either declare this fee
null and void requiring a refund, or
regulate SoCal as an interstate
pipeline.
         Union Pacific claims the fee
is an intrastate rate designed to
recover costs associated with certain
SoCal downstream compression
facilities. And, the company said,
SoCal is charging this rate to shippers
delivering upstream of the intrastate
facilities.
         Union Pacific added that if
SoCal is permitted to collect this kind
of fee, there is nothing to prevent
other utilities from imposing tolls.
The fight appears to be yet another
extension of the ongoing jurisdiction
fight between FERC and California
utilities.
         Union Pacific and supporters
allege SoCal has "implemented an
illegal and discriminatory incremental
access fee" charged to interstate
shippers delivering to SoCal's Wheeler
Ridge interconnection. This connects
SoCal with Pacific Gas and Electric,
Transwestern Pipeline, El Paso
Pipeline, and the Kern River Gas-Mojave
system.
         Union Pacific said the fee is
a "burden on interstate commerce that
violates the constitution."
         SoCal admits the fee is an
intrastate rate designed to recover
costs from intrastate compression
facilities, and that it has been only
charging the fees to interstate
shippers and not intrastate shippers.
         In fact, it gives fuel credits
to intrastate shippers. It also
admitted it has told shippers that if
the fee is not paid, delivery of gas
into Wheeler Ridge will not be
permitted.
         What SoCal is denying is that
the fee is in any way illegal or in
violation of federal law. And it firmly
maintains the fee is approved by the
California Public Utilities Commission.
         SoCal explained the Wheeler
Ridge facility was built for interstate
purposes and that some opponents on
this issue rejected the construction
opportunity.
          SoCal also asserts this issue
is not under FERC jurisdiction and that
no precedence exists which addresses

Arcadian, Southern agree to settle
on bypass

         Arcadian Corp. and Southern
Natural Gas are hammering out a
settlement that's expected to end much
of the regulatory and legal proceedings
surrounding the forced bypass of
Atlanta Gas Light (AGL) by Southern to
Arcadian's Augusta, Ga., plant.
         FERC last year reversed a
decision on rehearing and forced
Southern to provide a direct link to
the Augusta fertilizer plant, bypassing
AGL, which is Southern's biggest
customer. FERC found that Southern was
acting in a discriminatory manner when
it refused the Arcadian link after
providing a similar bypass for an Air
Products & Chemicals plant in New
Orleans. Arcadian started getting gas
directly from Southern in January, and
estimates the connection will save it
about $4.4 million per year.
         Southern, AGL and others
appealed the FERC decision in the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals, but the case
hasn't been decided.
         Before FERC granted the link,
Arcadian filed an antitrust suit
against Southern and AGL in U.S. court
in Georgia, charging them with a
"conspiracy" to protect the
distributor's "monopoly" hold on its
service area. Arcadian asked for
damages of $45 million plus court
costs. That case is still pending as
well.
         Announcement of the deal by
Arcadian last week was forced by the
companies' pending quarterly reports,
which mention the settlement, according
to Randall Saint Aubyn, Arcadian's vice
president, gas department.
         The settlement will result in
the withdrawal of all regulatory and
court action by all parties, to the
agreement, Saint Aubyn indicated.
         "The settlement also will
enable us to avoid the costs and
uncertainties associated with the
antitrust lawsuit and related
litigation and to establish a
beneficial, long-term commercial
relationship with Southern," said Doug
Campbell, president and CEO of
Arcadian.
         James Cleary, vice president
and general counsel at Southern, said
the pipeline's position would be known
once the settlement is filed at FERC,
which is expected to happen in the next
week.
         Some sources close to Arcadian
suggested there will likely be some
cash payment or discounted services by
Southern involved as well, but it may
not be disclosed by the companies. The
settlement also may address payment of
transition and take-or-pay costs to
Southern for which AGL is liable from
serving the Augusta plant.
         Another obstacle Arcadian
still faces is action by the Georgia
Public Service Commission (PSC) earlier
this year, which asserted jurisdiction
over negative imbalances on Southern's
system. The PSC, acting on a suggestion
from Atlanta Gas Light, contends that
any imbalance gas sold to Arcadian as a
result of an imbalance on Southern's
system is actually a retail sale and
subject to state jurisdiction. If the
PSC were to press the issue, it could
order Southern to stop transporting gas
to Arcadian until it applies for state
certification of such "sales." Saint
Aubyn said Arcadian expects this
problem to be resolved soon, since it
has asked for a summary judgement of
the issue.         SG

U.S. attorney seeks court order
against Iroquois

         A federal prosecutor has
sought to block Iroquois Gas
Transmission from taking testimony from
a long-time pipeline foe in a contract
dispute in order to protect the ongoing
federal criminal investigation.
         Craig Benedict, assistant U.S.
attorney for the Northern District of
New York, is seeking a court order from
a U.S. district court judge to prevent
Iroquois from taking a deposition from
Anne Mueser in a case brought by L.A.
Topsoil Co. seeking damages against the
pipeline. The disgruntled contractor
wants more than $3 million for failure
to pay for work contracted.
         Benedict is heading the
investigation that is a result of a
raid by the FBI on Iroquois' office
last year.
         Mueser has been the head the
GASP coalition, a group of landowners
originally opposed to Iroquois, and is
now working for a construction
contractor which helped build the
pipeline. As a long-time participant in
the environment and regulatory review,
she was in a position to know whether
or not permits were in compliance with
federal and state laws. She was witness
to some of the work performed by the
disgruntled contractor.
         The subpoena issued by the
court on behalf of Iroquois asks Mueser
to reveal her discussions with a list
of federal offices including the
Justice Dept. and the FBI, which have
nothing to do with the civil contract
dispute, the federal attorney told the
court.
         Benedict argues that Iroquois
is using the disposition to try to
uncover information in the ongoing
federal investigation into whether
Iroquois violated environmental laws in
the construction of the pipeline. "It
is important for the court to consider
whether the real motivation behind the
requested civil discovery is to obtain
improper criminal discovery," Benedict
told the court.
         In the motion seeking a court
order, Benedict also admits that the
case against Iroquois is now before a
grand jury.
         Benedict noted that the
federal government is not asking to
block all testimony in the civil case,
"only the prohibition of the taking of
a single disposition." Maybe the
parties "can resolve their contractual
disputes without impinging upon the
federal criminal investigation,"
Benedict added.
         Iroquois said yesterday that
Benedict's motion is just the first
volley of what is expected to be a
number of procedural legal motions in
ongoing suits against the pipeline.
         "There is nothing really
atypical to the action by Mr.
Benedict," an Iroquois official said.
         Mueser told the court that
besides the subpoena from Iroquois for
a disposition scheduled Wednesday,
Iroquois has asked to see all
information Mueser has accumulated on
the pipeline in the last seven years --
about 50 file boxes of materials.
         These boxes are now in the
"custody of the government," Mueser
said, and going through them for
Iroquois would be time-consuming.
         "Iroquois' tactics are a
transparent effort to seek information
that might be helpful in a pending
federal criminal investigation, as well
as an exercise calculated to harass and
cause undue hardship to a non-party
witness who successfully opposed this
company," Mueser told the court. A
legal assistant to the district court
judge said that a decision in the case
is likely by the end of the month.

Santa cites signficance of
gathering in policy

         How FERC handles the gathering
issue should be indicative of how the
entire range of "second-tier" Order 636
issues are dealt with at the
commission, said FERC Commissioner
Donald Santa.
         FERC's determination on how
much regulation is needed in areas
where competition can be shown --
possibly in the gathering issue, Santa
said.
         He said his preliminary notion
about gathering is to be as light-
handed as possible and realize that
gathering is not simply an extension of
transmission with its own set of
problems.
         "We ought to acknowledge this
half-slave half-free nature of
gathering" Santa said. FERC has
scheduled a technical conference in
February to discuss the gathering
issues. Santa outlined at the Natural
Gas Roundtable in Washington yesterday
the issues he sees as critical to
resolving the gathering issue.
          "First, let's get the facts
straight," Santa said about point
number one. "The commission does not
know much about gathering," Santa said.
"The first step is for the commission
to understand how gathering works in
real life."
         Santa noted the primary reason
for the upcoming public conference in
February is so the commission can "make
some well informed policy decisions,
based on fact."
         Second, the commissioner said,
FERC must find an "answer to the
threshold question; whether gathering,
nationally or locally, is a competitive
enterprise. Is regulation needed to
remedy market failure, and conversely
does the existing regulatory scheme
create a marketing failure?"
         Santa said the third basic
objective is to determine the
differences between pipeline, affiliate
and independently owned gathering
systems, and why or if they should be
regulated individually.
         The commissioner noted that
the pending Tenth Circuit Court
decision on Williams Gas Processing vs.
FERC, an argument of FERC jurisdiction
on gathering, may define "the
commission's ability to make some
distinction between pipeline- owned and
affiliate-owned gathering."
         The fourth point, Santa said,
is to answer the question, "does the
commission really need to regulate
gathering in order to satisfy its
statutory obligation?"          RR

Canada eyes NYMEX pricing

         Canadian marketers face the
same decision that their stateside
counterparts have already tackled: how
to use the NYMEX when it does not
reflect local fundamentals.
         NYMEX-based pricing crept into
one-year deals that started Nov. 1, and
many suppliers use it in at least a few
contracts. The next step, traders say,
would be to use it for monthly and
daily pricing.
         The NYMEX has manifested
itself in swap quotes at Empress.
Dealers and large marketers offered to
fix prices there for a year at levels
up to C5 cents higher than cash,
sources said.
         These parties need that
premium to cover their basis risk at
Empress, where the swap market is
illiquid, a marketer said. If they
can't find a counterparty to lay off
the basis, the dealers have to hedge on
the NYMEX, which may not reflect
Alberta prices.
         Using Gas Daily's monthly Nova
index for the past 12 months, adding
C20 cents for transportation to
Empress, and converting it to U.S.
dollars at C78 cents to U.S.$1, the
correlation to the average of the last
three days of futures settlement prices
is 77.7%. The conversions from
gigajoules to mmBtus were also made.
         "Physical players in the
province are not taking this basis
risk," the marketer said.
         This lack of correlation may
work in a supplier's favor at times,
because the swap quotes affect the
physical price quotes. Another marketer
was surprised that Empress prices fell
to $C2.25 per gigajoule this fall, so
he bought some gas at that level.
         And while those contemplating
fixed price swaps are wary about a lack
of correlation with the NYMEX, the
basis risk acceptors are unsure about
trade publication indexes at Empress,
showing risk for both sides of the
trade.
         A third kind of risk is credit
risk, which a Canadian analyst said
prevents swaps more than a year in
duration from being done at Empress.

DOE outlines status of energy law

         The Energy Dept. (DOE)
requirements under the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 (EPACT) will have little
impact on the natural gas industry if
DOE's latest implementation status
report is any indication.
         In fact, under the natural gas
section of EPACT, DOE's only duty is to
automatically approve certain gas
imports and exports. As far as the
status of that, DOE said it is "working
with [FERC] to ensure implementation of
this provision."
         There are other items
scattered throughout the EPACT
Implementation Status Report that could
benefit the gas industry, such as a
number of cost-shared gas technology
projects planned for 1994. The projects
will cover drilling, atlases and
databases, low permeability formations,
fracture technology, upgrading low
quality gas and secondary gas recovery.
         DOE also plans to assist Gas
Research Institute efforts to improve
coalbed methane recovery. Other
programs include a five-year research
and development program to increase the
recoverable natural gas resource base
and another five-year R&D program on
advanced natural gas supply
technologies. DOE is also assisting the
Interior Dept. with an EPACT
requirement to amend various lease
agreements and permits for oil and gas
production.
         DOE does have a number of
requirements under the alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs) section of EPACT,
however, which includes natural gas
vehicles. For example, in 1994, DOE
must establish data collection by the
Energy Information Administration on
alternative fuels, AFVs and how AFVs
are currently used.
         Some of the AFV programs have
been delayed. DOE was supposed to issue
guidelines to federal agencies to
measure the percentage of alternative
fuel use in dual-fueled vehicles by the
end of October, but that has been
delayed, awaiting action by the Office
of Management and Budget.
         DOE must also issue guidelines
to federal agencies for measuring the
percentage of alternative fuel use, and
issue regulations establishing
guidelines for state AFV incentives and
planning. That was scheduled to be
completed in October as well, but has
been delayed as well. Another plan to
establish a low interest loan program
for businesses that own or operate
fleets for conversion or purchase of
AFVs also scheduled for October
completion has been pushed back to
December.
         DOE has made some progress in
its AFV requirements. The department
has arranged for the purchase of more
than 5,000 AFVs for the federal fleet,
and provided AFV training to federal
employees.

EBB hooks up traders at Alberta's
AECO C hub.

         Alberta Energy kicked off its
electronic bulletin board (EBB)
yesterday when dedicated computer
terminals in the offices of five large
customers were used to nominate gas at
the AECO C hub in southeast Alberta.
         Another 35 customers will get
the terminals later this week, said
Gwyn Morgan, president of AEC Oil and
Gas, and another 40 early next year.
AECO C is a large storage facility and
hub at Suffield, Alberta, where daily
trading occurs.
         The hub is on the Nova system
and is a C10-13 cents haul from
TransCanada PipeLines at the Empress
border station with Saskatchewan.
Morgan said more than 80 companies are
customers there, trading at least 1.7
million cfd.
         Customers using the new AECO
LINK system can make nominations and
communicate with other players at the
hub via the EBB. The system also
provides a record of trades and their
status at the hub.
         "For the exchange of title,
you would get a confirmation back
electronically," Morgan said. "It saves
the telephone tag."
         AECO LINK also allows
customers outside of Alberta to arrange
for transportation after buying gas at
the hub. A balancing service provided
by Alberta Energy is also part of the
EBB.
         The terminals are installed at
no cost to Alberta Energy's customers,
and the system is supported by about 15
people on the marketing staff. He
declined to comment on the cost of the
system, which was developed in-house.
         While players can post if they
are short or long on transportation and
gas, AECO LINK is not yet an electronic
trading network, Morgan added. A
supplemental service is being developed
wherein traders can electronically
inform accountants at Price Waterhouse
about their deals, which would go into
a price index for AECO.
         Traders that participated that
day would have access to the index,
Morgan explained.
         Other companies in Canada,
such as Williams, WestCoast and Direct
Energy  are trying to create electronic
trading networks. Morgan said Alberta
Energy is having discussions with them
about tying into AECO LINK. "The more
services the better," he said.

Edisto to focus on domestic
reserves

         Edisto Exploration &
Production, a unit of Edisto Resources,
acquired a new, more flexible credit
line of $30 million which will be used
to acquire domestic reserves, expand
pipeline operations and attempt to
increase the market share of its gas
marketing operations at Vesta Energy.
International and certain other assets
are being sold.
         In line with increasing market
share, Edisto is pursuing acquisitions
of gas marketing companies to enhance
its Vesta activities. The focus on
marketing shows strong support for
Vesta, which has been the subject of
industry rumors that it would be sold
following Edisto's filing for
bankruptcy and subsequent
reorganization in June. The company has
always denied it.
         Vesta again made headlines in
August when Debbie Branch, president of
the Tulsa-based marketer, left the
company, as well as Robert Davis,
president and CEO of Esco, parent
company of Vesta Branch subsequently
formed her own company and took a
number of Vesta officials with her.
         Newly elected Chairman and CEO
Michael McGovern reviewed Edisto's
assets following its reorganization.
          In addition to focusing on
marketing, Edisto plans to increase
domestic reserves through development
of existing properties and through
acquisition. Edisto also wants to
expand transportation on its 214-mile
Missouri intrastate pipeline.
         International activities
offshore Tunisia are up for sale,
following the previous sale of onshore
properties in Tunisia and offshore
properties in Malaysia.
         The Multifex International
operations also are up for sale.
Multiflex is a manufacturer and
supplier of hose bundles and subsea
well control umbilicals.
         Edisto acquired an 80% equity
interest in March 1990.

Washington Energy hawks E&P unit

         Washington Energy is
considering selling some of the assets
of its subsidiary Washington Energy
Resources (WER), in an effort to
convert some of the exploration and
production company to cash.
         Washington Energy is also
looking at possible merger
opportunities and a public or private
stock offering. This doesn't mean an
outright sale of WER, a company
spokesperson said. It's an effort to
see what value the marketplace puts on
WER, she explained.
         WER holds reserves of 33.9
million barrels of oil equivalent as of
June 30, and has interests in 248
producing wells. WER holds an equity
interest in additional reserves and
interests in another 45 wells through
its investment in an unconsolidated
affiliate. The company also brokers gas
for third parties and provides gas
management services.
         Washington Energy said its
efforts to monetize WER are unrelated
to a recent rate case which
substantially reduced the annual
revenues of its largest subsidiary,
Washington Natural Gas. Washington
Natural requested a 9.98% overall rate
of return, but the Washington Utilities
and Transportation Commission approved
a rate of 9.15%. As a result,
Washington Natural filed rates last
month to reduce annual revenues by
$16.9 million.
         This also prompted the
Washington Energy board of directors to
reduce the company's quarterly dividend
from 35 cents to 25 cents

El Paso criticizes comments made
about case

         A high-ranking official of El
Paso Natural Gas took issue with
statements last week about allegations
by an independent marketer against the
pipeline.
         Rick Baish, senior vice
president of marketing, rates and
regulation for the pipeline, said he
couldn't comment on charges made by
Windward Energy & Marketing against the
pipeline, Meridian Oil and Burlington
Resources.
         He said the charges  "are
unproven allegations to try to avoid
judgement on the claim that we made
against [Windward] on the money they
owe us. That's pending before a federal
court in Tulsa.
         "It's obviously not pleasant
for us to read about that [in Gas
Daily], but beyond that we had a real
concern that someone ... would think it
appropriate to argue the merits of the
pending case in the newspapers when
it's before a federal judge," Baish
said.
         The stories published in Gas
Markets Week last weekwere taken from
public documents, and the accusers
wouldn't comment to Gas Markets Week on
the case. An attorney's comments
appeared at the end of the story.
         Baish was critical of the
attorney who was quoted anonymously in
the story about Windward's charges. The
attorney said that the gathering issue
was especially ripe since FERC was
considering how to handle gathering
jurisdictionally in the post-Order 636
environment.
         Baish asked that the anonymous
attorney be identified in any future
stories "so your readers can judge for
themselves what that person's agenda
might be." He found the attorney's
statements "grossly offensive."
         He thought the attorney may be
representing someone who would have an
interest in the outcome of the FERC
deliberations on gathering policy. "In
fairness, readers ought to be able to
make their own judgements about what
that person's agenda might be," Baish
said. "I thought what that person said
was entirely improper if not unethical.
I'm hard-pressed to be gentlemanly
about it. I find it hard to understand
how an attorney could make statements
obviously trying to influence FERC
based on allegations that he knew or
should have known [but which] have not
been proven."         MR

Williams introduces electronic gas
trading system

         Williams Energy Ventures
ushered in the new era of electronic
gas trading last week with all the
glitz and glamour that used to be
associated with the oil boom of the
late-1970s.
         The theme of the show was
"It's a jungle out there" in today's
gas trading business. A showroom and
multimedia presentation carried out the
theme with the message that Streamline,
as Williams calls its electronic
system, will turn the jungle into a
master planned community of orderly
trading.
         Unlike the unveiling of the
NYMEX-EnerSoft electronic trading
system on Oct. 20, also in Houston,
several computers had been set up to
demonstrate how buy and sell orders
will be posted, transacted and
nominated to pipelines.
         The few threads laid bare by
the unveiling were caused by
demonstrators who knew far more about
computers than they did about natural
gas trading. While they could dash
around with ease from window to window
in the colorful displays, they couldn't
answer certain detailed questions.
         Industry people attending the
show were forgiving, however, willing
to concede that electronic trading is
the future. As one trader joked to his
group, does this mean he won't able to
hide his big margins any longer?
         Streamline will one day
provide cash discovery at hubs around
the country if it's as successful as
Williams envisions. The system is
available now for installation and
training.
         The first hub, at Carthage in
northeast Texas, is expected to have
enough customers to become operational
by Feb. 1 or by the end of the first
quarter. Carthage ties in to six
interstate and eight intrastate
pipelines that supply 1 billion cfd.
Plus, hub operator East Texas Gas
Systems recently began operating
American Pipeline, which has nearby
interconnects with Natural Gas Pipeline
of America, Tejas Natural Gas (formerly
Exxon Gas Systems) and Texoma/Houston
Pipe Line. East Texas Gas is a
majority-owned affiliate of Union
Pacific Fuels.
         An Intra-Alberta Hub, located
on Nova Pipeline, is scheduled to be in
place early next year. A Westcoast
Energy subsidiary will put that system
on line.         RK

Columbia finds new LNG partner

         To meet the need for
electricity in the Washington, D.C.,
area and comply with the Clean Air Act,
Potomac Electric Power (Pepco) will
join Columbia Gas system in a joint
venture to restart the liquefied
natural gas (LNG) terminal in Cove
Point, Md.
         Columbia LNG and Pepco will
also seek FERC approval this week to
provide peak-day load-shaving services
to local distribution companies
starting with the winter of 1995-1996.
         A pipeline extends from Cove
Point to Loudon, Va. Pepco's interest
in Cove Point is to secure a reliable
and cost-effective source of
transportation to its Chalk Point
generating station via the pipeline.
         Columbia LNG will contribute
the terminal and pipeline in exchange
for an equity interest in the
partnership, and Pepco's subsidiary
will invest up to $25 million in equity
and debt. Pepco's investment will be
used to recommission parts of the
terminal, which has been shut down for
many years, and build a new
liquefaction unit.
         Cove Point, built in the mid-
1970s, is one of four terminals in the
country designed to receive deliveries
of LNG by ship. Currently, only a
terminal in Boston has enough demand to
justify operations.
           At one point last year,
Shell LNG was going to buy Cove Point
from Columbia, but the deal fell
through.

Order 636 didn't startle hedgers

         Order 636 hardly affected the
hedging plans of traders that Gas Daily
talked to this week, and brokers also
reported no changes in customer
activity. But lower temperatures and
more pipeline constraints in the
unbundled environment might have a
pronounced impact later, sources added.
         Spot cash prices have been
shooting up for the past week as fall
turns to early winter. Spot volumes
available for incremental needs seem to
be dwindling. A trader reported a
seller sought, but didn't get, a
December NYMEX equivalent for November
gas at Station 65 into Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line.
         December futures have been
volatile enough this week for different
brokers to talk about reaching $2.50 or
falling to $2.35. And at times gas
futures seemed to be trading in
sympathy with the rest of the energy
complex on the NYMEX.
         "The Merc will latch on to
whatever it needs to, and now the
strongest thing is cash," a buyer
countered.
         Order 636 went in place for
the bulk of pipelines during a
transition from a weak to strong
futures market, explained Tom Lord of
Morgan Stanley. "How do you sort out
636 from a change in market psychology
in the last two weeks?" he asked.
         Over the medium term, a trader
said "there's the possibility that if
we do get severe weather, there will be
enough uncertainty about supply that we
might get more volatile price spikes
compared to last year."
         With pipeline sales gas gone,
Order 636 changes the way storage is
filled, said a trading manager at a
marketing affiliate. "Wall Street feels
storage is the biggest factor in the
market," he said. "You'll probably see
greater efficiency in the use of
storage, and hedging to make it work."
