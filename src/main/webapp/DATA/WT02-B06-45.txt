<H2>National Research Council Report Calls Administration Crypto Policy into  Question</h2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>First Posted on May 31, 1996 || Last Updated on June 10, 1996</FONT>
<P>
On Thursday May 30, the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Research Council (NRC) released its comprehensive report on the state of U.S. encryption policy.  The report, "Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society," not only highlights the need for strong, reliable encryption, it calls the Administration's current cryptography policy in question.
<P>
Among other things, the report describes how the current US encryption
policy is not working, notes that classified information is not relevant to
the policy debate, and outlines the adverse impact export restrictions have
had on the domestic market.  In addition, the study emphasizes that market
forces and user choices, not law enforcement or national security
interests, should drive the development of encryption technologies and the
debate over US cryptography policy.
