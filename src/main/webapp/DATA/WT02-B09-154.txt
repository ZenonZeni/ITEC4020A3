<LI>Due to the nature of this procedure, which uses a metal needle
to remove the egg(s), there is potential risk of injury to other
organs: bladder, bowel, uterus, fallopian tube(s) or blood vessel(s).
A minor problem or a serious complication may develop (such as
internal bleeding and / or infection) which may require hospitalization
and / or further surgical intervention to correct the problem(s)
or to save life. This potential risk is less .1%. 
<LI>Pelvic scarring and / or technical problems may prevent recovery
of one or more eggs form the ovaries. 
<LI>There may be failure to recover an egg because ovulation has
occurred before the time or retrieval. 
<LI>One or more eggs may not be recovered on attempted aspiration
of the follicle. 
<LI>Laboratory conditions may arise which make it impossible or
impractical to proceed with in vitro fertilization at the time
that egg retrieval would otherwise be indicated. 
<LI>The eggs obtained may not be normal. 
<LI>The semen specimen produced may be of very poor quality, i.e.,
low count and motility, or it may not be able to be produced.

<LI>Appropriate laboratory processing of the sperm specimen may
be difficult or impossible. 
<LI>Fertilization of the eggs to form embryos may not occur. 
<LI>The embryos may not develop normally. If, in the physicians
best judgment, this occurs, efforts to continue growth of the
embryo(s) may be halted. When reasonably possible, this will take
place only after previous consultation with the patient and her
partner. Eggs or embryos which have failed to develop and are
therefore not viable will not be transferred. 
<LI>Embryo transfer into the uterus may be technically difficult
or impossible, due to unforeseen circumstances, or abnormal anatomy.

<LI>If transfer is performed, implantation(s) may not result,
(which is the most common cause). 
<LI>If implantation occurs, the embryo(s) may not grow or develop
normally. 
<LI>Equipment failure, infection, and / or human error or other
unforeseen factors may result in loss or damage to eggs, sperm
sample, and / or embryos. 
<LI>Follicles containing mature eggs may not develop in the monitored
cycle. This may prevent obtaining eggs, or may result in obtaining
immature eggs which will not fertilize.

<p>Most infants who have been born following human in vitro fertilization have appeared normal at birth; animal offspring have usually been normal following in vitro fertilization and/or embryo transfer.  Yet, congenital abnormalities, birth defects, genetic abnormalities, mental retardation
