<CITE> <FONT SIZE=+2>Rape, or sexual assault, or sexual harassment, or ...well, anything, really.  We referred to it as "the incident."</FONT></CITE> <p> 
Sexual assault is believed to be the most under-reported crime in the U.S., perhaps even in the world.  Persons victimized sexually, whether the assault be verbal or physical, report the assault(s) an estimated 1 time for every 10 assaults. Men are much less likely than women to report when they have been sexually assaulted or sexually harassed, though women, too, report infrequently.<p>
In 1992, the National Victim Center and the Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center released findings from two national studies.  They found that in America:
<li>Forcible rapes occurred at a rate of 1.3 per minute;
<li>78 forcible rapes occurred every hour;
<li>1, 871 forcible rapes occurred every day;
<li>683,000 forcible rapes of adult women occurred every year;
<li>An estimated 12.1 million women have been raped;
<li>Almost 5 million women have been raped more than once.<p>
Moreover, their findings suggested that the 683,000 rapes of adult women probably constituted well less than half of all the rapes that were experienced by all Americans of all ages and genders during that one year period.<p>
Most persons are sexually assaulted by someone they know.  In the study cited, only 22% of rape victims were assaulted by someone they had never seen before or did not know well.  Nine percent of victims were raped by their husbands or ex-husbands; 11% by their fathers or step-fathers; 10% by boyfriends or ex-boyfriends; 16% by other relatives; and 29% by other non-relatives, such as friends and neighbors.<p>
Most sexual assault victims do not sustain serious physical injuries.  In the study cited, 70% of rape victims reported no physical injuries; only 4% sustained serious physical injuries, with 24% receiving minor physical injuries.<p>
<H3>What is rape?</H3><p>
In the state of Tennessee (laws differ by state) rape is penetration, however slight, of one person's body by some part of another person's body or by an object when that penetration is gained without consent by force, coercion, threat, or by fraud.  Included in the definition for Tennessee is a clause that says a person is not consenting when he/she is incapable of consenting (e.g. drunk, unconscious, mentally incapable of giving consent) and the offender knows or has reason to know this.<p>
The Rhodes College Sexual Harassment and Assault Policy defines sexual assault as "...rape, forcible sodomy or sexual penetration with an inanimate object, the intentional touching of an unwilling person's intimate parts (defined as genitalia, groin, breast or buttocks, or clothing covering them), or forcing an unwilling person to touch another's intimate parts.  To constitute an assault, the above acts must be committed without consent of the victim by threat, intimidation, or through the use of the victim's mental or physical helplessness of which the accused was aware or should have been aware."<p>
<H3>What is sexual harassment?</H3><p>
Sexual harassment, according to the Rhodes Policy, includes, but is not limited to: "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:
<PRE>	1)	submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
				or condition of an individual's employment or status in the College or in
				a course, program or activity;
	2)	submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a
				basis for employment or educational decisions affecting such individual;
	3)	such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with
				an individual's work or educational performance, or of creating an
				intimidating, hostile or offensive environment for work, learning or
				living."</PRE> <p>
<H3>Why do so few people report rape?</H3><p>
<li>Sexual assault is a difficult crime to prosecute because it is a crime that has (usually) only two 	witnesses -- the victim and the offender, usually has little external physical evidence, and is usually a crime committed between two people who know each other.  Thus, many rape victims do not think their report will be taken seriously, or that the reporting process is worth the effort it will require.
<li>In the National Victim Center study, 71% of victims said they were concerned about family knowing about the assault.	
<li>Many rape victims fear people thinking the assault is the victim's fault.
<li>Some cultures discourage reporting rape because it defaces the family, or because the offense should 	be dealt with in the family rather than through a "social" entity.
<li>Many sexual assailants scare their victims into not reporting by making threats or by using emotionally or physically intimidating statements.
<li>The criminal processes to prosecute a rape case can take up to 3 or 4 years, thus discouraging some
victims from reporting.  They say, "I just want to put this behind me."
<li>Half of the victims responding to the National Victim Center study said they feared their names being made public by the media.
<li>Persons assaulted by a same-sex offender are often afraid they will be identified as homosexual.
<li>Gay and lesbian victims are often afraid their orientation will be made public if they report.
<li>Some people never call it rape, denying what happened was a crime, and thus do not report.<p><p>

<center><H2>What to do if you or a friend is raped</H2></center><p>
<li>If you can, immediately following the assault seek assistance from a trusted person.
<li>Go to a safe place.
<li>If you think you might want to report the crime, do not shower, douche, urinate, defecate, or rinse your mouth.  If you must change your clothes, put the clothes (and any other items that might have been involved in the assault such as sheets, towels, etc.) in a <U>paper</U> sack.
<li>Seek medical attention as quickly as possible.  Internal injuries might not be immediately evident to you.  Also, you can get prophylactic medication for some sexually transmitted diseases and for pregnancy (if that is an issue) within 72 hours from the time of the assault.  Even after 72 hours, it is important to get tested for STDs including HIV and to have a physical exam to insure you are okay.
<li>Take things slowly, do not commit to decisions you aren't sure about.
<li>To report an assault, contact Campus Safety (ext. 3880) and/or Memphis Police Department (528-2222).
<li>To file a complaint against a student, contact the Dean of  Student Affairs (ext. 3815).
<li>To file a complaint against a faculty member, contact the Dean of Academic Affairs (ext. 3795).  
<li>To file a complaint against a staff member, contact the Dean of Administrative Services (ext. 3760). 
<li>To talk confidentially with a counselor, contact the Rhodes Counseling and Student Development Center (ext. 3849) and/or the City of Memphis Sexual Assault Resource Center (528-2161). Sexual Harassment/Assault Advisory Committee members are also a resource.
<li>Consider going to the Memphis Sexual Assault Resource Center for free and confidential medical, counseling, and forensic services.  Their phone (528-2161) is answered 24 hours a day.
<li>Talk to someone you trust about the rape.  Keeping the feelings inside won't make the rape go away.

<center><H2>Understanding the emotional cost of rape</H2></center><p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3.8 million American women have had rape-related post-traumatic stress disorder and an estimated 1.3 million currently have the disorder.</BLOCKQUOTE> -- National Victim Center<p>
The emotional impact of rape is different for every victim.  However, some patterns do emerge in types of emotions many rape victims experience:
<li>In the first few hours post-rape the victim often feels shocked, disbelieving, and numb.
<li>In the first few days post-assault, the victim often feels tired, sad, hurt, and afraid.
<li>In the first few weeks post-assault, the victim often feels afraid, self-blaming, and ashamed.
<li>In the first few months post-assault, the victim often begins to feel angry, afraid, and stressed.
<li>In the first few years post-assault, many victims have problems with interpersonal relationships,
anger management, stress fatigue, and substance misuse.<p>
The National Victim Center found that, compared to non-victims of crime, rape victims were: (as coping techniques after the assault)
<li>5.3 times more likely to have used prescription drugs non-medically;
<li>3.4 times more likely to have used marijuana;
<li>6 times more likely to have used cocaine;
<li>10.1 times more likely to have used hard drugs other than cocaine; and
<li>6.4 times more likely to have used hard drugs or cocaine.<p>
Additionally, the Center found that 30% of rape victims had experienced at least one major depressive episode in their lifetimes and 21% of all rape victims were experiencing a major depressive episode at the time of assessment. Rape victims were also 4.1 times more likely than non-crime victims to have contemplated suicide, and 13 times more likely to have made a suicide attempt.<p>
Rape is not only a physical violation, it is an emotional violation.  One very helpful means to regain emotional stability is to seek assistance from a trusted resource, such as a counselor or minister.<p><p>

<center><H2>How do we stop rape?</H2></center>
<OL>
<LI>Communication -- between you and your sexual partner, between you and friends, between you and 	acquaintances.  Talk about sexual assault.
<LI>Destigmatize rape.  Make rape a word we say.  Talk about rape in your classes, in your groups, and among your friends.  Make "rape" an acceptable topic to acknowledge.
<LI>Set limits and stick to them in sexual behavior with a partner.  Do not say "maybe." Do not think "no" means "talk me into it." Do not say "yes" when you aren't sure.
<LI>Avoid mixing alcohol or other intoxicating substances with intimacy.  Over 70% of all college population acquaintance rapes involve the use of alcohol or other drugs.
<LI>Stop your friends from going "home" with someone if your friends or the other person are intoxicated.
<li>Get educated on what rape is and share that knowledge with others.
