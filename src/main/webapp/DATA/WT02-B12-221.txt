Countries<BR>

<P>

International Center for Migration Policy. Moderator: Philip Martin,

Professor, University of California, Davis. 

<P>

<B>Discussion Questions</B>

<P>

&iuml; Immigration policy involves three fundamental questions:

how many immigrants should be admitted, from where should they

come (or who should have priority to enter), and in what status

should immigrants enter. How are industrial countries answering

these questions? Whose interests tend to be most important in

making <B>and</B> enforcing entry rules? What time dimensions

enter into immigration debates? 

<P>

&iuml; What are current immigration flows into industrial countries?

How can we compare or rank countries in their openness to immigrants?

Is a society's openness to immigrants in any manner analogous

to its openness to foreign goods? 

<P>

&iuml; Is there an upper limit on the annual influx of foreigners

or on the foreign share of the population (Canada adds almost

one percent to its population annually via immigration; the U.S.

about 0.4 of one percent; in Switzerland, foreigners are 18 percent

of the population; in Germany, nine percent; in the U.S., eight

percent). Are such comparisons of immigration flows and stocks

misleading because each country has a different understanding

of the term &quot;immigrant.&quot; In the US, for example, most

of the foreigners have a right to become citizens, while most

foreigners living in Switzerland are not expected to become citizens.

How are foreigners/immigrants integrated into a new society?

<P>

&iuml; What influences the &quot;absorptive capacity&quot; of

a nation? Gross numbers? History? Demography and Economics? Geography?

Regional concentration/dispersal of immigrants? 

<P>

&iuml; What determines the range of views on how easy it will

be to integrate particular groups of immigrants? Is &quot;absorptive

capacity&quot; affected by the number and type of immigrants arriving,

socio-economic conditions when they arrive, or the speed with

which their arrival changes the ethnic/racial/religious composition

of the population? 

<P>

&iuml; Should the annual inflow of immigrants be set by an annual

ceiling or &quot;quota?&quot; Should the intake of immigrants

vary with domestic socioeconomic conditions, such as the unemployment

rate, or with international events, such as the number of refugees

and asylees seeking entry? How can annual limits be enforced?

<P>

&iuml; How large is the contribution of immigration to population

and labor force growth? In a country with a declining native population,

such as Germany, should immigration be used as a policy to prevent

the population from shrinking?<BR>

<BR>


<P>

<B>Discussion Questions</B>

<P>

&iuml; The focus on this session is <B>whether, why, and how</B>

the influx of unskilled workers into industrial societies should

be regulated. Illegal workers can be converted into legal workers

or immigrants via temporary worker programs and amnesties, so

we want to discuss--from economic, political, and social points

of view--<B>whether, why, and how </B>an industrial country should

attempt to control entries. 

<P>

&iuml; Presentations will make reference to three points. First,

to what extent are the benefits of unskilled migrant workers in

an industrial society such as the U.S. immediate and concrete

in the form of higher profits for some employers, and concentrated

in the hands of a relatively few people? To what extent are any

costs associated with unskilled immigration delayed, diffused

across society, and difficult to measure, since they include integration

issues? 

<P>

&iuml; Second, why is there so much controversy over the economic

effects of migrant workers in industrial democracies? Theory would

suggest that the presence of migrant workers should raise profits

and depress wages, increase total employment and unemployment,

and slow the search for labor-saving change. Why do researchers

have such a hard time finding any significant such effects? There

will be a discussion of examples of the effects of immigrants

in particular sectors, such as nursing, construction, agriculture,

hotels and restaurants, and garments. 

<P>

&iuml; Third, what would happen to these sectors and to the economy

as a whole without immigrant labor? How should non-specialists

think about the trade-offs involved in front-door legal immigration,

side-door guestworker migration, and back door illegal immigration?

Russell, MIT and the World Bank. Moderator: Jorge Bustamante,

<P>

&iuml; The U.S. is the world's major country of immigration, Mexico

is the world's major country of emigration, and most Mexican immigrants

historically arrived as illegal or irregular aliens who were later

legalized. How have demand-pull, supply-push, and network factors

evolved between Mexico and the U.S.? Which factors are most important

in explaining current migration flows? What is the prospect that

the North American Free Trade Agreement will break these links,

and over what time periods are NAFTA's effects expected to be

visible?<BR>


<P>

&iuml; We will be traveling to Mexico to visit some of the &quot;maquiladoras&quot;--foreign-owned

assembly plants--that employ about 1 in 5 Mexican manufacturing

workers. To what extent does trade in the labor-intensive goods

assembled in these plants substitute for migration? If these factories

employ mostly young women, do they also draw young men to the

border area who later cross the border illegally? How are patterns

of Mexican migration to the United States changing after NAFTA.

Immigration Patterns and Policies 1

<P>

Why Regulate Unskilled Immigration ? 2

<P>

Can Trade be a Substitute for Migration? 4

<P>

Practical Options for Managing Illegal Immigration 5

<P>

Prop 187 6<BR>


<P>

The purpose of the seminar was to explore four major questions:


<P>

&iuml;what is the gap between immigration policy goals and outcomes

in the US and Western Europe? 

<P>

&iuml;why should industrial countries try to regulate unskilled

immigration?

<P>

&iuml;can trade and investment arrangements such as NAFTA reduce

emigration pressures?

<P>

&iuml; what are practical options to deal with unskilled immigration

pressures? These questions were framed by Europeans and Americans,

discussed in a general session, and then in small groups. In addition,

these issues were discussed during the field trips. <BR>


<P>

Immigration Patterns and Policies<BR>


<P>

The opening session noted that there have been enormous and unanticipated

changes in the US and around the world over the past three decades.

These changes have given the US far more immigrants, especially

from Asia, and neither the increased number of immigrants, nor

the rise in Asian immigration, was anticipated.<BR>


<P>

The US made four major changes in its immigration policies during

the past three decades: in 1965, 1980, 1986, and in 1990. In each

case, the unanticipated consequences have been as significant

as the expected effects of these immigration reforms.<BR>


<P>

Many Americans do not believe governmental promises that efforts

to control illegal immigration will soon succeed. This national

failure to manage illegal immigration has produced an anti-immigrant

reaction, especially in California. Managing migration has become

the number one issue in the nation's largest state.<BR>


<P>

European nations are getting immigrants, but they have not yet

accepted the responsibility to deal with immigration prospectively

and realistically. For example, Europeans still avoid discussing

the three fundamental immigration questions of how many, from

where, and in what status immigrants should arrive.<BR>


<P>

The number of immigrants arriving in Europe has been racheting

upward despite tough talk, new laws, and even departure bonuses.

Europe's major political parties have primarily been reactive,

trying to do enough to blunt the appeal of anti-immigrant parties

so that immigration does not dislodge the parties that have run

Europe for the past five decades.<BR>


<P>

Most experts believe that European governments must become forward-looking,

taking steps to prevent unwanted migration, and developing a GATT-analog

General Agreement on Migration Policies (GAMP) to promote the

coordination of efforts to manage migration.<BR>


<P>

It was generally agreed that <U>pressures</U> to cross national

borders will rise rather than fall in the years ahead, but it

was emphasized that rising migration pressure or potential does

<U>not</U> necessarily mean rising migration. In other words,

there was not a consensus that the only choice open to the receiving

countries is whether to accept migrants through front, side, or

back doors--indeed, most participants believed that migration

management was both possible and should be given higher priority

by governments.<BR>


<P>

It was also agreed that the fear of the stranger is real and can

easily be exploited. The recent civil rights/individual rights

revolution resulted in an elite consensus not to play the &quot;immigration

card&quot; for political purposes, but California's Proposition

187 may be a harbinger of change.<BR>


<P>

It is also clear that ideas that would have been scoffed at even

five years ago get a respectable hearing today. These include

using military intervention to prevent disruptive migration, as

in Haiti, taking at least symbolically tough steps to reduce unwanted

migration, as exemplified by Proposition 187 in California , police

checks in France, and the German law that requires public employees

to report suspected illegal aliens.<BR>


<P>

There was a general concern that the growing gap between immigration

policy goals and outcomes could lead to larger problems. For example,

it was noted that Germany and the Scandinavian countries believe

that they can prevent illegal immigration, so they hew to legal

and illegal categories, with the result that some public employees

feel forced to become immigration agents. France and the US, on

the other hand, are more likely to accept their inability to eliminate

illegal immigration, leading to incomplete amnesties and the development

of schemes through which some rights are granted to illegal aliens.

<BR>


<P>

Second, it was emphasized that voters at the bottom of the labor

market could express their frustration at the gap between immigration

goals and outcomes by voting for anti-immigrant parties or taking

direct action against foreigners. Third, it was emphasized that,

in a global economy linked by freer trade and capital flows, relations

between nations can be disrupted by immigration disputes.<BR>


<P>

Why Regulate Unskilled Immigration ?<BR>


<P>

Most of the immigrants arriving in industrial nations are unskilled,

meaning that they have less than the median level of education

of native-born adults. Since immigration pressures are rising,

and immigration control is getting more difficult, this session

asked a simple question--why bother with control, or how much

resources and energy should be devoted to controlling unskilled/illegal

immigration?<BR>


<P>

It was emphasized that this question has been avoided regularly

by immigration commissions in the US. Their normal justification

for doing more to curb illegal immigration is that, in a nation

of laws, illegal immigration is wrong and, if it persists, antipathy

toward illegal immigrants might lead to a less open front door

to legal immigrants.<BR>


<P>

Immigrants in industrial countries are a small part of the worldwide

labor force and a marginal part of industrial country workforces,

so that any effects they have will be marginal for both developing

and industrial nations. It was also noted that economic theory

finds that it is not optimal to completely stop unwanted activities

such as pollution and illegal immigration because the costs of

achieving a zero level outweigh the benefits.<BR>


<P>

But perhaps the most interesting observation was that, in Europe,

it seems to be easier for blue-collar workers to push society

toward a &quot;too restrictive&quot; immigration policy, while

in the US employers and ethnic groups have been able to organize

themselves to get a &quot;too open&quot; policy toward unskilled/illegal

immigration.<BR>


<P>

Immigration is neither good nor bad; it produces economic and

other tradeoffs. Three economic tradeoffs seem especially important

in evaluating unskilled immigration. First, unskilled immigrants

on balance hurt unskilled native workers through wage depression,

displacement, and changing patterns of hiring and training. However,

these changes affect less than 20 percent of all native workers,

and many occur in a fashion that is not visible to in statistical

studies of immigrant impacts. The fact that these impacts are

not easy to measure does not mean that they do not exist.<BR>


<P>

Second, the availability of immigrant workers affects the evolution

or trajectory of those sectors of the economy where immigrants

are concentrated. In the US economy, there are only three occupations

with 1 million or more workers in which immigrants are a majority

of the workforce--farmworkers (2.5 million), janitors (2 million),

and household help (1 million). These sectors are also not well

studied in comparison to other economic sectors, so it is not

always easy to see what would happen without immigrants. However,

in the case of agriculture, the termination of the bracero program

in 1964 spurred a cost-reducing series of innovations that made

the US a world leader in processed tomato products.<BR>


<P>

Third, the immigrants arriving in the US today, if arrayed by

the best single predictor of earnings, years of education, have

an hourglass or barbell shape. This means that current immigration

patterns are increasing economic inequality.<BR>


<P>

The discussion emphasized that immigrants have many economic effects,

sometimes improving the position of some native workers, as when

unskilled immigrants in the fields create or preserve jobs for

truck drivers. It was also noted that the trajectory of an industry

is not shaped just by immigration. In US transportation industries,

for example, the major changes in the labor market are traceable

to de-regulation.<BR>


<P>

The discussion also emphasized that foreigners willing to work

for low wages can affect domestic workers directly via immigration,

or indirectly through trade and investment flows. <BR>


<P>

The discussion concluded with a consensus that, if unskilled/illegal

immigration is to be controlled in the 1990s, countries need have

flexible policies that adapt to changing patterns of movement.

Economic differences between industrial and developing countries

are widening, increasing incentives to enter industrial countries

enough so that e.g., Chinese nationals pay $30,000 to be smuggled

into the US to fill unskilled jobs.<BR>


<P>

Can Trade be a Substitute for Migration?<BR>


<P>

This question was answered simply: yes, and free trade and investment

are the only instruments guaranteed to eventually reduce migration

pressures. But there is a short-run migration hump, meaning that

the disruptions and dislocations associated with deregulating

and opening an economy increase migratory pressure. If there are

established migratory links, the same polices that reduce migration

in the long run can increase migration in the short run.<BR>


<P>

Labor migration is a big business. The remittances sent to countries

of origin by the 20 to 25 million foreign workers in industrial

countries are in the $40 to $50 billion range, as each worker

remits perhaps $2000 annually. If the industrial countries were

to succeed in stopping migration, or removing the foreign workers

already there, countries of origin might lose a major source of

foreign exchange.<BR>


<P>

Economic growth is the ultimate answer for economically-motivated

migration, but economic growth does not have to equalize wages

to stop migration. Analyses and experience suggest that once economic

differences are reduced to 4 or 5 to 1, and there is confidence

that wages will continue to increase in the country of origin,

migration pressures fall sharply.<BR>


<P>

The world community has not yet figured out how to deal with economically-motivated

migration in international organizations and agreements. Most

countries are avowedly not destinations for immigrants, making

them more likely to cooperate to reduce immigration than to establish

the rules under which it should occur. However, regional trade

agreements, which tend to be more comprehensive than global agreements

such as the GATT, increasingly deal with migration.<BR>


<P>

Mexico is the ninth most populous country in the world, with about

90 million people and a labor force of about 30 million. The country

grew rapidly with an import substitution policy during the 1950s

and 1960s, and thought that it could continue this policy when

oil prices rose in the 1970s. Debt rose, oil prices fell, and

in 1982 the country was in crisis.<BR>


<P>

Mexico changed its economic policies in the mid-1980s, embracing

policies that aimed to attract foreign investment and to create

jobs in export-oriented industries. One of the fastest-growing

sectors of the Mexican economy have been maquiladoras, the 2000

factories in the border areas that employ 500,000 Mexican workers

to turn imported components into products that are mostly exported

to the US. <BR>


<P>

NAFTA plus &quot;correct&quot; economic polices in Mexico promise

faster economic growth in the 1990s. But the need for faster economic

growth is larger than even freer trade and investment can provide--Mexico

has 1 million new workforce entrants annually, so that even creating

500,000 &quot;real jobs&quot; each year is not sufficient for

new entrants plus those displaced from inefficient industries

such as agriculture. Furthermore, Mexico has a very unequal distribution

of income, so that the benefits of fast growth are not automatically

shared in a manner that leaves especially poor people in rural

Mexico satisfied with their lot.<BR>


<P>

Mexican researchers expect illegal Mexican immigration, estimated

at 800,000 to 2 million entries per year today, to decline significantly

after NAFTA plus Mexico's current polices have been in effect

for at least 10 years--50 percent of the Mexican estimate of 800,000

illegal entries were apprehended at least once by the US Border

Patrol. However, the next 10 years promise very contentious debates

over persisting illegal immigration. <BR>


<P>

There is a fundamental difference in the definition of the migration

problem. Mexicans see migration as an economic issue. They note

that it is not the bottom of the Mexican workforce that migrates

to the US, and that the wages earned by unauthorized immigrants

in the US are just as legitimate as the profits earned by their

US employers. The Mexican perspective is that if the US really

wanted to stop illegal immigration, it would crack down on US

employers, since their demand for Mexican workers is what motivates

Mexicans to cross the border.<BR>


<P>

The US perspective, in the Mexicans' view, is that unauthorized

Mexican workers are criminals. This prevents, they say, useful

negotiations toward a bilateral migration agreement. <BR>


<P>

Europeans tend to favor aid rather than trade to reduce migration

pressures, in part because many of the emigration countries would,

with freer trade, export agricultural products to Europe. In other

words, agricultural protections are in part responsible for urbanization

and migration pressures from Morocco to Turkey. <BR>


<P>

In the case of Morocco, freer trade would make the country an

agricultural exporter. But freer trade alone would cause problems,

one of which is that Morocco now gets one-fourth of its governmental

revenue from import tariffs. <BR>


<P>

The discussion emphasized that there are significant differences

in US-Mexican relations along the 2000 mile border. Even though

northern Mexico is richer than other parts of Mexico, San Diego

is one of the richer areas of the US, while the TX border towns

are among the poorest in the US. Border Patrol operations that

reduce apprehensions sharply are popular in both areas. <BR>


<P>

Practical Options for Managing Illegal Immigration<BR>


<P>

There were very different practical options discussed. One approach

is to review the various control options tried, to emphasize the

flaws in each, and to conclude that the best option is to manage

inevitable migration. For example, fortifying the border is expensive,

and its long-run effectiveness is not yet clear. Eliminating social

services for unauthorized aliens may not have much of a deterrent

effect on migrants seeking jobs, and may complicate the provision

of services to so-called mixed families that include members with

a variety of legal statuses.<BR>


<P>

The other approach is to acknowledge that no control measure is

a magic bullet cure, but that enforcement measures can have effects

on migration at the margin, and can send symbolic messages to

the public that something is being done. The US now enforces on

targets of opportunity--such as Prop 187's attempt to detect those

who seek public services--and enforces indiscriminately--as when

all Haitian boat people are returned without screening.<BR>


<P>

A strategy of detection and detention/deportation was urged. Once

an illegal alien is detected, there must be, it was argued, a

procedure to determine quickly who is not eligible to remain,

and then those persons must be removed quickly in order to avoid

the development of equity stakes that lead to exceptions(the US

deported only 38,000 aliens in 1993).<BR>


<P>

Island nations such as the UK tend to rely on border controls,

and not on internal controls such as employer sanctions. Nations

with many borders and mass tourism industries such as France tend

to place most of their enforcement emphasis on interior controls.

Each country is debating how to engage in interior controls that

are effective while respecting human rights. What may seem overly

intrusive in one country is considered normal in another, such

as France's random ID checks on the streets, versus the opposition

to a national work permit in the US. These differences in what

are acceptable controls help to explain why international coordination

in immigration control efforts may be so difficult to achieve.

<BR>


<P>

It was also emphasized that the willingness to embrace immigration

controls depends on how much of a problem such immigration is

perceived to be. Many of those who recoil at e.g., national work

permits believe that illegal immigration is not a serious problem,

and are thus not willing to support what they see as an &quot;extreme&quot;

solution.<BR>


<P>

Prop 187<BR>


<P>

The seminar concluded with a discussion of Prop 187, the California

ballot initiative that was approved by a 59 to 41 percent vote

on November 8, 1994. Prop 187 can be modified only with a 2/3

vote of the California Legislature or by another initiative.<BR>


<P>

Prop. 187 has five major sections. First, it bars illegal aliens

from the state's public education systems from kindergarten to

university, and requires public schools to begin verifying the

legal status of both students (on January 1, 1995) and their parents

(on January 1, 1996). Second, all providers of publicly-paid,

non-emergency health care services must verify the legal status

of persons seeking services in order to be reimbursed.<BR>


<P>

Third, Prop. 187 requires that all persons seeking cash assistance

and other benefits verify their legal status before receiving

benefits. Fourth, all service providers are required to report

suspected illegal aliens to California's Attorney General and

to the INS, and police must determine the legal status of persons

arrested. Fifth, the making and use of false documents is now

a state felony.<BR>


<P>

Some of these provisions&nbsp;restate current law, such as barring

illegal aliens from cash assistance programs, but add a California-administered

verification procedure. Other provisions conflict with current

law, such as those barring illegal alien children from schools,

and these conflicts will have to be resolved in the courts before

they are implemented.<BR>


<P>

The discussion generally decried the denial of education and health

care services to persons needing them. There was little disagreement

on the goal of doing more to reduce illegal immigration, and it

was suggested that better border and interior enforcement, as

well as persuading Mexico to cooperate in preventing illegal exits,

would be preferable to the Prop 187 approach. However, it was

noted that, at least in the case of public education, the major

argument against denying access is that the children will stay,

which implicitly says that the US cannot control illegal immigration.

<BR>


<P>

The seminar ended on a consensus note that immigration issues

are likely to become more rather than less important, and that

issues such as Prop 187 will push the issue ever higher on national

and international agendas.<BR>
