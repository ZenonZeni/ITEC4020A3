<h1>Neural Networks</h1>
<p>Neural networks, also referred to as neural nets, mimic the human brain's most powerful ability, that of pattern recognition. A 
neural net can make a decision or a prediction by drawing on an inventory of patterns previously learned, seeking the one most 
relevant to the current situation. What distinguishes neural nets from &quot;classical&quot; Artificial Intelligence paradigms, such as 
rule-based systems, is that they &quot;learn&quot; by example and modify themselves, rather than having to be programmed with specific 
preconceived rules. </p>
<p>Neural nets use layers of real or &quot;simulated&quot; electronic neurons with various numeric weights. These weights are dynamically 
modifiable in the &quot;training&quot; phase representing the connection strengths between them to &quot;learn&quot; a predictive ability. A trained 
neural net can be described as a matrix of neurons and connection strengths that represent the &quot;solution&quot; to a problem. 
Commercially available neural net shells, as well as those still being researched, use a variety of algorithms to adjust the 
connection strengths between the neurons until convergence is achieved and the system is able to make correct predictions 
with a significant percentage of accuracy. Once the network successfully sets the weights of the connections to produce the 
correct output, the trained net is ready to use as a predictive or diagnostic tool. </p>
