<font size = +1>

<center>COUNT 1</center>
150.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>151.  With respect to constitutionally protected
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms and
practical effect, bans a substantial amount of speech by and to
adults, including speech by and to plaintiffs, their members, and
their subscribers, patrons and customers, in violation of the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

<p><center>COUNT 2</center>
152.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>153.  With respect to constitutionally protected
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms and
practical effect, unduly burdens and deters a substantial amount
of speech by and to adults, including speech by and to
plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers, patrons, and
customers, in violation of the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution.

<p><center>COUNT 3</center>
154.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>155.  Sections 502(1) and 502(2) of the Act unduly
chill and compel self-censorship of constitutionally protected
speech of plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers,
patrons, and customers, in violation of the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution.

<p><center>COUNT 4</center>
156.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>157.  Section 502(2) of the Act, 47 U.S.C.  &#167; 223(d), is
fatally overbroad.  In particular, it bans, burdens, and
criminalizes speech that is constitutionally protected for
adults, and for older minors, restricting both adults and 17
year-olds to communications appropriate for 7 year olds.  And it
bans, burdens, and criminalizes a much broader range of
constitutionally protected expression than is constitutionally
permissible.  Accordingly, the provision violates the First
Amendment.

<p><center>COUNT 5</center>
158.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>159.  Any blocking system to be imposed by the content
provider/speaker would require advance identification of those
seeking access to a particular Web site, chat room, discussion
group, or other online forum that might potentially contain
communications that could be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" to persons under 18.  See 47 U.S.C.  &#167; 223(e)(5)(B). 
A requirement of advance identification would make it impossible
for users to engage in constitutionally protected anonymous
speech on matters of public and private importance.  For many
users, such anonymity is critical to their participation in the
speech.
<br>160.  For such users, the Act will require them to
choose between anonymity and losing access to such
communications.  As a result, in many cases, their First
Amendment rights to read and view constitutionally protected text
and images will be infringed.
<br>161.  Section 502(2) accordingly violates the First
Amendment.

<p><center>COUNT 6</center>
162.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>163.  Plaintiffs are unable to determine with
reasonable certainty which constitutionally protected expression
Congress sought to proscribe in  &#167; &#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and (d).  In
particular, the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards" are entirely
subjective; as a matter of law depend on the context in which the
communications arise; are undefined and undefinable in the
cyberspace context; have entirely different meanings depending
upon the age of the recipient even though the Act treats all
minors of all ages the same; and give no indication as to which
community governs the inquiry.  In these, and other ways, the Act
does not put reasonable persons on notice of what communications
are prohibited.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, and
subscribers, patrons, and customers are forced to guess at which
speech on interactive computer services may give rise to criminal
prosecution.
<br>164.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and
"patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards," and of other provisions of the Act, and the draconian
penalties for a wrong guess, will force plaintiffs, their
members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, and
substantial numbers of other providers of content to the
Internet, to self-censor far more speech than would in fact be
prohibited in order to comply with their understanding of the
Act's requirements, or to avoid potential criminal prosecution,
and will thus chill constitutionally protected expression.
<br>165.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and
"patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards," and of other provisions of the Act, invites arbitrary
enforcement.
<br>166.  The Act is, accordingly, so vague as to violate
the First and Fifth Amendments.

<p><center>COUNT 7</center>
167.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>168.  Plaintiffs reasonably fear that the defenses
under the Act will not be construed as broadly as Congress
intended, and will therefore subject their dissemination or
facilitation of constitutionally protected speech to criminal
prosecution and conviction in several significant contexts.
<br>169.   The "good faith defense," which is the only
defense even arguably available to non-commercial content-
providers, gives insufficient guidance to content-providers as to
whether their dissemination of constitutionally protected speech
is prohibited.  Plaintiff content-providers have no means of
ascertaining whether a jury will determine that they have taken
"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the
circumstances" to restrict minors' access to material that is
"indecent" or "patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards."  Act 502(2), to be codified at 47 U.S.C.
 &#167; 223(e)(5)(A).
<br>170.  Similarly, service providers who host Web sites
or other online sites, without controlling content, but on whose
facilities others' communications reside, reasonably fear an
aggressive prosecutor will argue, contrary to plaintiffs'
understanding of Congressional intent, that such actions will
constitute a "display" of such communications under
 &#167; 223(d)(1)(B), and that such services are not protected by the
"access provider" defense, even though the service providers'
role clearly "does not include the creation of the content of the
communication."   &#167; 223(e)(1).
<br>171.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with
reasonable certainty rely on the access provider defense,
 &#167; 223(e)(1), to exempt access providers' operation of USENET news
servers that automatically store content posted by users, which
remains on their servers for a number of days and is available to
subscribers.
<br>172.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with
reasonable certainty determine whether the defense,  &#167; 223(e)(1),
applies to ISPs who assist content providers in establishing or
operating Web pages or other online sites, and who, although
having no control of content, might be deemed to be a
"conspirator" under  &#167; 223(e)(2) if they knowingly arrange for
access to valuable, constitutionally protected material that may
be deemed "indecent."
<br>173.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, and
their subscribers, patrons, and customers, are forced to guess at
whether their activities may give rise to criminal prosecution.
<br>174.  The uncertainty of how prosecutors or the courts
will construe the defenses, the fact that they are only defenses,
which must be raised and proved after a defendant has already
been subjected to the humiliation, stigma, and expense of a
criminal prosecution, and the draconian penalties for a wrong
guess, will force plaintiffs, their members, and their
subscribers, patrons, and customers, and a substantial number of
other providers of content to the Internet, to self-censor speech
protected by the First Amendment in order to comply with their
understanding of the Act's requirements, or to avoid potential
criminal prosecution, and will thus chill constitutionally
protected expression.
<br>175.  The vagueness of these provisions invites
arbitrary enforcement.
<br>176.  Sections 502(1) and (2), accordingly, are so
vague as to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.

<p><center>COUNT 8</center>
177.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>178.  Sections 502(1) and (2) of the Act violate the
First Amendment rights of plaintiffs, their members, and their
subscribers, patrons, and customers, insofar as they single out
for special bans or burdens speakers engaged in one class of
constitutionally protected speech by one specific medium, and do
not similarly ban or burden speakers engaged in other classes of
speech, or in the same speech via other mediums, without
sufficient justification.

<p>WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court:
<br>A.  Declare that Sections 502(1) and (2) of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C.  &#167; &#167; 223(a)(1)(B),
223(a)(2), and 223(d), are unconstitutional; 
<br>B.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendants
from enforcing those provisions.
<br>C.  Award plaintiffs such costs and fees as are allowed
by law; and 
<br>D.  Grant plaintiffs such other and further relief as
the Court deems just and proper.

<p>Respectfully submitted,
