<H2>About the EOC </H2>
<BR>
The CSIRO Earth Observation Centre (EOC) will provide leadership in CSIRO
for generic Earth Observation science and provide means for Australian industry
to &quot;take charge&quot; of its future in space and airborne services
for mapping and monitoring.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="anchor15499648"></A>Vision &amp; Mission</H2>
<H3>EOC Vision Statement</H3>
To ensure that Australia gains maximum benefit through the development and
application of advanced technology based on Earth Observation data. 
<H3>EOC Mission Statement</H3>
The Earth Observation Centre will conduct multidisciplinary, internationally
competitive and collaborative research and development. The results of this
will support the goals of and benefit existing CSIRO Divisions, Australian
agencies and industry groups as well as potential users of information derived
from Earth Observation and related data.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="anchor15501587"></A>Objectives</H2>
<H3>EOC Objectives</H3>
To accomplish its Mission, the EOC will:<BR>
<BR>
1. Work closely with other CSIRO units, Divisions and clients in Agencies
and industrial Sectors to undertake research and develop products that are
beyond the scope of single groups and to serve common interests and purpose;<BR>
<BR>
2. Develop CSIRO niche activity, excellence and collaborative developments
in international Earth Observation science by linking the efforts and skills
of scientists who are dispersed geographically and by Sector client focus;
<BR>
<BR>
3. Together with CSIRO Divisions, data capturing and using Agencies and
industry groups, develop standards and deliver best research practice algorithms
and techniques for value added products which in the short and long terms
serve the needs of industries and groups that use Earth Observation data;
and<BR>
<BR>
4. Ensure access to Earth Observation data products for CSIRO researchers
and other users where this is not otherwise available and work closely with
the data delivery industry to ensure that all data users have access to
data of the highest quality.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="anchor15513957"></A>Threads &amp; Focus Areas</H2>
<H3>Applications Oriented Threads</H3>
Most Earth Observation applications demand products that are the result
of a sequence of activities from acquisition, through base processing, interpretation
(often based on modelling) and finally to product presentation. These sequences
will be referred to as 'Threads'. The generic EOC Tasks can be seen as components
of applications oriented Threads which map across Focus areas and retain
a consistent set of 'dimensions' in terms of Target, Platform and Sensor
as well as overall objective in the final products and results. Threads
are the road maps between raw data acquisition and sector oriented products.<BR>
<BR>
End users are interested in products and behind each product is the technology
the EOC serves. The combination and interaction of components in this technology
is the Thread. Threads will be the primary areas of concern out of which
EOC Tasks are defined and EOC products valued. Any one EOC Task can and
usually will also involve a number of Threads that pass through it from
different data sources and on to different types of end product. Thread
Coordination is an important activity and is between clients (who generally
relate closely to the output end of Threads) and the EOC management.<BR>
<BR>
The generic research Tasks which may be each be a component of a Thread
of Tasks, are grouped and monitored within four primary 'Focus' areas for
generic Earth Observation Science:

<UL>
<LI><B>Program Support</B>, 
<LI><B>National and International Scientific Interaction</B> and 
<LI><B>Application Oriented Thread Coordination</B> 
</UL>
comprise seven areas which provide a more aggregated and persisting basis
