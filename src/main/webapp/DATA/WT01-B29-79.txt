<p>HOUSE CHAMBER ACTION </p>

<p> FOR THE LAST THREE LEGISLATIVE DAYS </p>

<p> 02-08-95 </p>

<p> Exclusionary Rule Reform: By a recorded vote of 289 ayes to
142 noes, Roll No. 103, the House passed H.R. 666, to control
crime by exclusionary rule reform. </p>

<p> Agreed To: </p>

<p> The Volkmer amendment that exempts searches and seizures
carried out by or under the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms from the relaxation of the exclusionary rule
(agreed to by a recorded vote of 228 ayes to 198 noes with 3
voting 'present', Roll No. 101). Earlier, a Conyers amendment was
offered but subsequently withdrawn that contained identical
provisions; </p>

<p> The Traficant amendment that exempts searches or seizures
carried out by or under the authority of the Internal Revenue
Service from the relaxation of the exclusionary rule; and The
Fields of Louisiana amendment, as amended by the McCollum
substitute, that provides that none of the provisions shall be
construed so as to violate the fourth article to the
Constitution. </p>

<p> Rejected the Serrano amendment that sought to exempt searches
or seizures carried out by or under the authority of the </p>

<p> Immigration and Naturalization Service (rejected by a
recorded vote of 103 ayes to 330 noes, Roll No. 102). </p>

<p> 02-07-95 </p>

<p> Exclusionary Rule Reform Act: House completed all general
debate and began consideration of amendments to H.R. 666, to
control crime by exclusionary rule reform; but came to no
resolution thereon. Consideration of amendments will resume on
Wednesday, </p>

<p> February 8. </p>

<p> Rejected: </p>

<p> The Conyers amendment that sought to limit and codify the
'good faith' exception to searches and seizures with warrants
later to be found invalid; and to enact the current limited 'good
faith' exception for searches in which evidence was not excluded
if it was retained in a 'good faith' reliance on a statute, which
was later held to be unconstitutional (rejected by a recorded
vote of 138 ayes to 291 noes, Roll No. 98); and </p>

<p> The Watt amendment in the nature of a substitute that sought
to strike provisions applying the 'good faith' exception to the
exclusionary rule to warrantless searches; and to replace it with
the text of the fourth amendment of the United States
Constitution (rejected by a recorded vote of 121 ayes to 303
noes, Roll No. 99). </p>

<p> H. Res. 61, the rule under which the bill is being
considered, was agreed to earlier by voice vote. </p>

<p> 02-06-95 </p>

<p> Reports Filed: The following reports were filed as follows: </p>

<p> H. Res. 61, providing for the consideration of H.R. 666, to
control crime by exclusionary rule reform (H. Rept. 104-20). </p>
