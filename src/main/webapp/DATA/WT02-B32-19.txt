<h3>Enzymes and Enzyme Reactors</h3>
Studies on fundamental behaviour (i.e. function and kinetics ) cover a number
of enzymes.  These include enzymes for protein modification, the modification
and breakdown of pectins and yeast cell wall components and phenol oxidation.
Work is in progress on free and immobilised enzymes and on behaviour of enzymes
in solvents, in multiliquid systems, and in high-viscosity environments.
<p>
Amongst novel potential applications for enzymes under examination are the use
of phenol oxidase in new biotransformations such as L-dopa synthesis, and the
use of lytic glucanase for permeabilisation of yeast cell walls. Enzyme reactor
design studies include modelling of a fluidized bed reactor system for carrying
out enzyme reactions in organic solvents.
<p>
<h3>Downstream processing and Separation Processes</h3>
This is an area of great challenge in biotechnology, and is a central area of
specialisation.  The work includes fundamental and applied aspects of a range
of processses.  Amongst current topics of interest are the mechanisms of
transport in liquid membranes and separation processes using "supported" liquid
membranes for the separation of organic acids and aqueous two-phase systems for
the separation of proteins.  The effect of protein charge and hydrophobicity on
the partitioning of proteins in aqueous two-phase systems is being investigated
in order to develop mathematical correlations to predict partitioning
behaviour.  Mass transfer and kinetic studies are also being carried out.
<p>
Lytic enzyme systems for the controlled lysis of yeast cells are being
investigated as a means of obtaining the selective release of cell products,
such as  enzymes, intracellular recombinant proteins, and/or the fractionation
of cellular substructures, such a glucan polymers and mitochondria.
<p>
Also being examined is the separation of proteins using reverse micelles. A
comparative investigation of protein surface hydrophobicity in chromatography
(HIC, RP-HPLC), precipitation and aqueous two-phase systems is being carried
out. Other areas of study are concerned with the comparative thermodynamics and
economics of alternative separation processes and with the overall synthesis
and design of protein separation schemes using expert systems.  A database on
physico-chemical properties of proteins as well as mathematical correlations
for separation operations is being generated to be used in the rational design
of protein separation sequences.
<p>
<b>Bioprocess engineering including bioreactors and process modelling</b><p>
The design, control and optimisation of biochemical reactors entails an
understanding of both the biochemistry and kinetics of the reactions and the
physical processes, such as mixing and mass transfer.  Work on characterising
the microenvironment that occurs in bioreactors, on the effects of mixing and
on novel reactor designs and novel solid substrate systems is in progress.
Biochemical studies include the control of the microbial synthesis of
biodegradable thermoplastic polymers, the control of multi-product
fermentations and the differentiation of plant cells in relation to the
regeneration of whole plants from cells in submerged culture.  The application
of modern control theory and methods to optimise on-line control is of great
current interest.  Maximization of enzyme synthesis and production using
optimized fed-batch cultures is being investigated.  Research on the
mathematical modelling and microprocessor-based control of bioreactors and
downstream separations such as continuous adsorption recycle extraction is
underway.
<p>
Amongst the studies on bioprocess modelling are included the sterilisation of
multi-phase systems by the passage of electric currents (i.e. "ohmic heating"),
which is being evaluated as an alternative to conventional heat treatment
processes, the behaviour of new pilot scale counter-current solid/liquid
extractor and bioreactor, and selected membrane separation processes.
