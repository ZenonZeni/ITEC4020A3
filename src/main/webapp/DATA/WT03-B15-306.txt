<H1>Rebound in Construction Output in 1997 to be led by Commercial and
Industrial Work</H1></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes the September 1996 issue of <I>UK
Construction Prospects</I>, containing detailed forecasts for the construction
industry to the year 2003.</P>
<H2>Upturn on the Way as New Work Recovers</H2>
<P>Following the 1% contraction in 1995, construction output is forecast to
stop falling this year and see growth of around &#189;%.  Falls in new work,
particularly in the public sector and in housing, are expected to be more than
offset by growth of around 2&#189;% in R&amp;M, most notably in the private
non-housing sector.</P>
<P>Thereafter, strong growth, in excess of 3% pa, is forecast for 1997 and
1998.</P>
<P>An expected improving performance by UK manufacturers in 1997 is expected to
stimulate greater investment in industrial new work.  This will narrow the
divide in fortunes that has appeared between the slack private industrial sector
and the rapidly-growing private commercial sector (which has been fuelled by
strong service sector growth in late 1995 and 1996).  Infrastructure output is
expected to be boosted by rail and airport projects despite the decline in roads
spending. Recovery in the UK housing market has gathered pace through 1996, and
is expected to fuel renewed growth in housing starts and output in 1997.  The
buoyant private non-housing R&amp;M sector, expected to see double-digit growth
in both 1996 and 1997, will also contribute strongly to the overall recovery.</P>
<H2>Highlights in Types of Work</H2>
<P><I>Private Housing (new and R&amp;M)</I> - housing market transactions
picked up in 1996Q2 and prices have risen by more than 5% in six months.  Houses
are now more affordable than for almost two decades and mortgage rates are lower
than they have been for 30 years.  Although the emerging upturn in starts and
output will be unable to rescue the sector from an overall decline in 1996, new
work is forecast to accelerate as confidence continues to return to the market. 
In the long term, the impact on new development of the growing number of UK
households will be constrained by land availability and a shift in fortunes
towards R&amp;M after 2000 is expected.</P>
<P><I>Public Housing (new and R&amp;M)</I>- public housing and housing
association orders were 22% lower in 1996Q2 than in the previous quarter and 26%
down on a year earlier. New work output fell by 7.3% in 1995 and is forecast to
show a further 10% for 1996 as a whole.  A more modest decline of around 2&#189;%
is expected in 1997.  Cuts on the scale of 1995 and 1996 are not considered
sustainable in the longer term, whichever party forms the next government, and
so some recovery in output is projected after 1997.</P>
<P><I>Infrastructure and Other Public New Work </I>- despite the completion of
some notable major projects (such as the Jubilee Line extension), projects such
as Terminal 5, Manchester Airport, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Thameslink
are expected to fuel output growth of 3% in 1997 and almost 6% in 1998. 
Thereafter, the absence of projects of a similar scale in the pipeline means
that output could fall back in the long term.</P>
<P><I>Private Industrial and Commercial </I>- is expected to continue to grow
strongly as recovery in manufacturing investment, boosted by large inward
investment projects, restores private industrial growth to over 3%.  Meanwhile,
strong UK service sector growth is expected to drive further demand for office
and retail space, and consequent private commercial growth of over 6% pa from
1996 onwards</P>
<P><I>Non-Housing R&amp;M</I> - is expected to continue its buoyant trend
(though only in the private sector) driven largely by the ongoing privatisation
of Railtrack and the consequent &#163;10bn overhaul of the UK rail network over
the next ten years.</P>
<H2>Moving to a Green Economy: Implications for the Aggregates Industry</H2>
<P>The report features a supplement focusing on the impact on the aggregates
industries of a shift towards policies to promote environmental sustainability,
and suggests strategies to respond to this shift.  The supplement concludes that
businesses which define, or redefine, their missions to add more value to fewer
materials will find that they are sailing with the spirit of the time: they will
be in a position to comply comfortably with new regulations and seize business
opportunities and will enjoy a good public reputation. and improved long-term
profitability.  In contrast, businesses that continue to define their mission as
making profits by pushing larger volumes of material, especially environmentally
harmful materials, through the system, will be buffeted by a gale of regulatory
and popular opposition.  They may be able to snatch some short-term gains from
the storm, but they will be long-term losers.</P>
<H2>Notes for Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company, and has
been providing detailed economic and industrial forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,
the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic and
industrial forecasts available for the UK, based on the `Cambridge model', known
as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy (MDM).</P>
<P>Forecasts for the DoE types of work (shown in Main Table 1 in the report)
have been prepared using a sub-model which projects each of the types of work on
the basis of its key sources of demand.  These include the forecasts for
investment in buildings and works disaggregated by industry (shown in Main Table
2 in the report) and consumers' expenditure on construction work.  The forecasts
of investment in buildings and works come from the Cambridge integrated
macroeconomic and sectoral model of the UK economy, MDM.  Investment in any
sector depends mainly on prospects for output (itself dependent upon prospects
for demand and competition from imports) and interest rates.  Additionally, data
on key new projects - for example, inward investment decisions - are
incorporated explicitly.  Investment prospects for some sectors depend on
government policy or other specific factors to a large extent, and so
assumptions are made for investment in these cases, namely oil and gas, water,
sewerage, electricity, roads and rail.</P>
<P>The DoE data for output by type of work incorporate the infrastructure
series in order to minimise the difficulties in the new work data caused by the
programme of privatisation since 1979.  However, some problems remain, notably
the allocation of work to the infrastructure series for non-housing R&amp;M,
public and private.  The privatisation issue has been specifically modelled by
Cambridge Econometrics, using data over the period from 1980 onwards on the
public/private ownership of each of the 49 industries distinguished in MDM.</P>
<P><I>UK Construction Prospects </I>is published twice a year, in March and
September.</P>
<P>The cut-off date for the information used in the model run for this report
was 6 September 1996.</P>
<P>viii + 39 pages, with 29 charts/figures and 10 tables.</P>
