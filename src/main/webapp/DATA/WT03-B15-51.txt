<P>The Irish section of Amesty International campaigns on general
refugee issues, both in Ireland, and worldwide. It has recently
been heavily involved in a long-running campaign to have legislation
passed in Ireland to set up proper procedures for dealing with
asylum seekers. It also campaigns on the problems associated with
the harmonization of asylum law within Europe, and on major international
refugee crises, such as occured in Rwanda. Amnesty International
in Ireland, because of a lack of resources, does not deal with
individual asylum cases.

Refugees arriving into Ireland can be put into two different categories:
<OL>
<LI>&quot;Programme refugees&quot; - Groups of refugees from a
particular region or ethnic background who have been invited to
Ireland by the Government, at the request of the UNHCR.
<LI>Those individuals who make their own way to Ireland, and ask
for asylum here.

On 11-6-96 The Minister, Joan Burton, stated in the Seanad that
the number of new arrivals to date in 1996 was 438.

The greatest number of applicants for refugee status in Ireland
originate from Romania, Algeria, Somalia and Zaire respectively.
Other smaller numbers come from parts of Asia, West Africa, Central
Africa, Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

<B>Programme Refugees</B>
<P>
There are at present in Ireland approximately 1,200 programme
refugees, about half of whom are Bosnians, and the other half
Vietnamese. During 1995, 175 Bosnians arrived as programme refugees
into Ireland. The policy of family re-unification means that the
figures for programme refugees are changing all the time. During
1995, 53 Bosnians and 30 Vietnamese arrived in Ireland as a result
of family re-unification. A few programme refugees have returned
to their countries. During 1995, 12 Bosnians returned to Bosnia.
Some programme refugees also emigrate to other countries. The
needs of programme refugees are looked after by the Refugee Agency
(15 Marlborough Court, Dublin. Tel: 01-8787200)

<P>
The basis of international refugee law is the 1951 Geneva Convention,
together with its 1967 New York Protocol. Ireland signed the Geneva
convention in 1976. Article 33 of the Geneva Convention sets out
the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids a refugee being
directly or indirectly sent back to a country where his or her
life or freedom would be endangered, be it because of race, religion,
nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political
convictions. It is this principle which underlies all refugee
law.

<P>
Up until 1996, Ireland had nothing on its statute books to regulate
procedures for dealing with asylum seekers to this country. Asylum
applications were dealt with by the Department of Justice, according
to its own procedures. Following a long-running campaign in which
the Irish section of Amnesty International was very heavily involved,
the Refugee Bill 1995 finally became law in June 1996. Published
as part of the Bill are the Geneva Convention, and also the Dublin
Convention, which Ireland will now become a signatory to. The
Dublin Convention is an agreement made between the member states
of the EU to establish which country will deal with specific asylum
applications. It is the first EU country which an asylum seeker
arrives in which has the responsibility, under this Convention,
of hearing the application. Since standards of treatment for asylum
seekers vary widely from country to country within the EU, this
can have serious implications for some asylum seekers.

<P>
Amnesty International welcomes the new Refugee Act. This Act,
for the first time, lays down in law procedures for how asylum
seekers to Ireland are to be treated, and it has many positive
aspects to it. These include a broadening of the definition of
a refugee to include those persecuted for their sexual orientation,
and those persecuted for membership of a trade union. Asylum seekers
whose applications are turned down will be able to appeal the
decision, and there will also be an appeals process to the operation
of the Dublin Convention.

<P>
However, the new Act also gives the Minister the right to override
the refugee determining process and to deport a recognised refugee
on the grounds of &quot;public Policy&quot;. It remains to be
seen how these powers will be used in practice. <BR>

refugee case law of many countries, may be found in

On arrival, all asylum seekers are entitled to emergency accommodation
in the Red Cross Hostel, Youth Hostels, temporary flats, Bed &amp;
Breakfast, or sometimes hostels for homeless people.

<P>
Asylum seekers without income are entitled to Supplementary Welfare
Allowance, Rent Deposit and Allowance, Fuel Allowance, and discretionary
Exceptional Needs Payments, such as Clothing Allowance, at the
same levels as Irish people receiving welfare benefits. Asylum
seekers who are parents are entitled to claim Child Benefit for
all children under 16, and those between 16 and 18 in full-time
education.

<P>
Recognised refugees are entitled to work, and to family re-unification.
They are also entitled to social welfare payments and education
grants in line with the entitlements of similarly situated Irish
citizens. Those with Humanitarian Leave to Remain now also have
these rights. Those still seeking recognition of their refugee
status do not have the right to work.

<P>
Asylum seekers are entitled to a medical card, which gives them
free access to general practitioners in Ireland, and free hospital
and dental care. There are as yet no specific provisions for a
comprehensive system of specialist health-care for asylum seekers
and refugees, which would guarantee the expertise needed to understand
their special situation. There is a need for appropriate services
for victims of torture, imprisonment, and warfare, who have suffered
severe physical and psychological distress.

<P>
There is provision by the Department of Education for a specialist
educational support service for children of primary school age
among the programme refugees (Vietnamese and Bosnians). Asylum
seekers have no right to language classes, education and training
funded by the state, but the Irish Refugee Council in Ennis does
receive state funding for free English language classes for asylum
seekers . There is, as yet, no similar scheme in Dublin.
