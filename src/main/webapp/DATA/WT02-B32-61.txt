Dr Jenny Ames obtained her BSc in Food Science at The University of Reading and
her PhD in Flavour Chemistry at London University. Following postdoctoral
studies at both the Universities of London and Reading, she was a Lecturer at
South Bank Polytechnic, London, before returning to Reading as a Lecturer in
1987. She is currently a Reader in the Department.
<p>
<B>Research Interests</B><BR>
Research deals with the chemistry underlying flavour and colour development in
foods, especially the Maillard reaction, and the effects of processing and
subsequent storage on flavour and colour development. Major highlights are as
follows. 
<p>
<I>The Maillard reaction</I><br>
The Maillard reaction takes place when food components like reducing sugars and
amino acids react together and occurs in most foods on heating. Research deals
with factors affecting the reaction and how it may be optimised and
controlled.

<p>
<i>Colour</i><br>
Studies on the coloured reaction products are supported by the BBSRC. Work on
aqueous systems has revealed major differences in the reaction product profile
on heating with and without pH control. Several compounds have been isolated
and analysed. Work on systems of intermediate moisture content heated by
extrusion cooking or in a reaction cell (which mimics most of the conditions
encountered during extrusion cooking and which was specially designed for the
project), has shown that decreasing moisture content and increasing
temperature, time or pH all increase colour development. <p>
<i>Flavour</i><br>
Research on flavour is supported by MAFF, a Teaching Company Scheme and the
food industry. Recent studies on Maillard flavour compounds have shown the
important role played by pH in affecting the profile of volatile reaction
products. The implications of modifying food processing conditions or using
novel food processes, such as high pressure processing and microwave heating,
are of particular interest.<p>
<u>Meat flavour</u><br>
Work has involved the study of model systems, especially those based on
thiamine, and real meat. At the moment, a project on lamb flavour is being
completed. Interest lies in establishing the compounds responsible for specific
meaty notes and how levels of these compounds can be optimised by, e.g.,
cooking conditions.<p>
<u>Flavour of fruits and vegetables</u><br>
The flavour compounds of various less common fruits and vegetables have been
studied, e.g. starfruit, scorzonera, celeriac and okra. The effects of
processing on flavour are of interest.<p>
<u>Flavour of fermented foods</u><br>
The study of fermentation as a method for preserving various foods is an
important area for the Department and this is another area of involvement.<p>
<p>
All my research deals with the chemistry underlying flavour and
colour development in foods, especially the Maillard reaction. I show
outstanding dedication to my own research and to that of my research team which
numbers 12 members (3 postdoctoral research)<p>
<br>
<b>Teaching Acitivities</b><p>
The Maillard reaction and caramelisation; minor food components, instrumental
analysis.<p>
<br>
<b>Consultancy</b><p>
Confidential work has been carried out in a number of the areas mentioned above
for companies both in the UK and abroad.
