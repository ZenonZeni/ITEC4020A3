        <CENTER><H3>The FBI's Domestic Counterterrorism Program</H3></CENTER>
<p>
 Recent news commentary has suggested that the FBI is
hamstrung in its efforts to combat domestic terrorism.  One
former FBI official was quoted as saying that "you have to wait
until you have blood on the street before the Bureau can act." 
Steven Emerson has asserted that the FBI is severely restricted
in infiltrating known extremist groups, that it has no terrorism
data base like the CIA's, and that it is powerless to stop
extremist groups from masquerading as "religious" groups.
<p>
All of these claims are incorrect.  Persons concerned about
addressing the threat of terrorism need to begin with a clear
understanding of current FBI capabilities, which are in fact
broad.
<P>
<ul><b>Attorney General Guidelines</B></ul>
<p>
The FBI currently operates under a set of guidelines issued
in 1983 by Ronald Reagan's Attorney General, William French
Smith.  The Smith guidelines were a modification of guidelines
issued by Gerald Ford's Attorney General Edward Levi in 1976. 
The Levi guidelines were criticized as being too restrictive and
cumbersome.  Indeed, many of the criticisms of the current
guidelines are really the same criticisms lodged against the Levi
guidelines, which the Smith guidelines were intended to rectify.
<p>
The Smith guidelines make it absolutely clear that the FBI
does not have to wait for blood in the streets before it can
investigate a terrorist group.  The guidelines expressly state: 
"In its efforts to anticipate or prevent crimes, the FBI must at
times initiate investigations in advance of criminal conduct."
<p>
The threshold for opening a full investigation is low: a
domestic security/terrorism investigation may be opened whenever 
"facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that two or more
persons are  engaged in an enterprise for the purpose of
furthering political or social goals wholly or in part through
activities that involve force or violence and a violation of the
criminal laws of the United States."
<p>
Indeed, the FBI is also authorized to open a preliminary
inquiry on an even lower threshold:  The Bureau can begin
investigating when it receives any information or allegation
"whose responsible handling requires some further scrutiny." 
Preliminary inquiries can be conducted without headquarters
approval for 90 days, during which the FBI can conduct
interviews, contact confidential sources and previously
established informants, and carry out physical surveillance. 
Preliminary inquiries can be extended with Headquarters approval.
<p>
    <ul><b>Advocacy</b></ul>
<p>
One of the main purposes of the Smith guidelines was to make
it clear that the FBI could open an investigation based on
advocacy of violence.  While urging respect for the First
Amendment, the guidelines state: "When, however, statements
advocate criminal activity or indicate an apparent intent to
engage in crime, particularly crimes of violence, an
investigation under these guidelines may be warranted ... ."
<p>
     <ul><b>How do the Guidelines work in practice?</b></ul>
<p>
In any given year, the FBI engages in approximately two
dozen full domestic terrorism investigations.  Over the years
since the Smith guidelines were adopted, nearly two thirds of
these full investigations were opened before a crime had been
committed.  The FBI has investigated right-wing, anti-government,
anti-tax, paramilitary and militia groups under this authority. 
The FBI's characterization of White American Resistance (WAR) is 
typical: After opening a domestic terrorism investigation of WAR,
the FBI stated "No known acts of violence have as yet been
attributed to WAR; however, leaders of the group have been
encouraging members to arm themselves."
<p>
The FBI has been successful in preventing terrorist crimes
before they occurred.  In 1993, for example, the FBI arrested
several skinheads in Los Angeles after a lengthy investigation
determined that they has been discussing and planning attacks on
a black church, Jewish targets and other religious targets.
<p>
Calling something a church or a religious organization does
not immunize it from investigation.  In fact, a number of the
white supremacist groups investigated by the FBI had assumed a
religious mantle, under the "Christian Identity" philosophy.  The
FBI investigated under the terrorism guidelines the Yahweh
Church, a militant black group in Miami, and other religious
groups.   
<p>
Nothing in law or logic prohibits the FBI from opening
investigations based on public source material or reports from
private civil rights groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
The FBI opens investigations based on any credible source,
including news reports.  For example, the FBI opened a civil
rights investigation into the Rodney King case as soon as
officials saw the broadcast of the videotape.  And the Justice
Department has met with abortion rights activists to solicit
information about groups that may be planning attacks on abortion
clinics.  
<p>
    <ul><b>Terrorist Information System</b></ul>
<p>
The FBI has a state of the art, on-line computer database
known as the Terrorist Information System containing information
on suspected terrorist groups and individuals.  The system has
over 200,000 individuals and over 3000 organizations or
enterprises.  The individuals indexed include not only subjects
of investigations but also known or suspected members of
terrorist groups, associates, contacts, victims and witnesses. 
The organizations or enterprises include not only terrorist
groups but also affiliated organizations or enterprises.  TIS
allows the FBI to rapidly retrieve information and to make links
between persons, groups or events.  
<p>
<ul><b>Issues to Be Considered</b></ul>
<p>
There appears to be a growing problem of disaffected loners
who cut themselves off from all groups.  An increased effort to
monitor anti-government groups is unlikely to identify these
loners, who may pose the greatest threat.  In this context, the
enterprise concept that serves as the basis of the Smith
guidelines -- and that serves as the basis for calls for greater
infiltration of groups -- may be irrelevant.
