<h3><i>Bendigo's vision:<br>
To continue as the fastest growing major regional centre through
the world competitiveness of our core industries of manufacturing,
commerce and tourism.</i></h3>
</center>
<P>
Bendigo is one of Australia's major regional centres with a population
of<B> </B>80,000.  It is serviced with an infrastructure that
can cater for growth well into the 21st Century.
<P>
Bendigo provides a natural focus for the vast, rural hinterland
of northern Victoria and southern New South Wales, blending the
facilities and attractions of a thriving city with the more relaxed
lifestyle of a rural environment.
</FONT>
<h2>Access to markets</h2>
<P>
<img src="gifs2/bendigo1.gif" align=right>
Located 150 kilometres north of Melbourne, Bendigo is the geographic
centre of Victoria.  Rail connections to Melbourne are excellent,
via V/Line's high speed sprinter trains.  It is ninety minutes
by road from Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport, and major improvements 
to the Calder Highway will continue to reduce travel time
by road.
<P>
The Hume and Mclvor Highways provide an alternative route to Melbourne,
while the Midland and Loddon Valley Highways give the region easy
access to population centres in New South Wales and South Australia.
 V-Line provides a passenger freight rail service to and from
Bendigo, while the city's airport, five minutes' drive from central
Bendigo, provides flights to most major centres.  Bendigo Railway
Station handles pallets, light freight and parcels, and is equipped
with a mobile crane and fork lifts.
<H2>Major manufacturing centre</H2>

<P>
Manufacturing is of major importance to the district and accounts
for 12.6 per cent of all employment.  The manufacturing base is
broad.  Food processing is the biggest employer in the manufacturing
sector, followed by textiles, clothing and fabricated metals.
<P>
Major companies already operating in the region include Sandhurst
Farms (milk products), Australian Defence Industries (precision
engineering), Stafford Ellinson (clothing) and Hazeldene's (poultry).
 Each of these companies employs over one hundred people and adds
to the region's manufacturing ability.
<P>
Local trade-exposed firms are competing successfully in export
markets with products such as car seat covers, stockfeed, wool
carpet yarns, pork products and other food items.
<H2>Labour and training</H2>

<P>
Bendigo has a large skilled and non-skilled workforce, and local
businesses have access to a wide variety of training providers.
 In addition to the tertiary institutions, a number of private
organisations are accredited to provide formal training and vocational
training programs.
<P>
The training needs of a business can be met with programs designed
to meet each company's specific requirements.
<H2>Telecommunications</H2>

<P>
Bendigo is also home to the most significant Telstra facility
in Australia outside a capital city.  The network and the satellite
and landline communications systems give Bendigo instant access
to the global network.  It is the site for the receiver dish for
the Iterra Satellite Network, providing a significant link with
international and national communications.
<P>
The substantial base of computer and telecommunications facilities
within Bendigo ensures high quality maintenance service, and a
pool of experienced personnel.
<H2>State of the art infrastructure</H2>

<P>
The region's water supply is sufficient to cater for an anticipated
population growth of 130,000 by the year 2020.  Bendigo's
sewage treatment facility, following a recent $25m upgrade, now
has the capacity to service up to 200,000 people.  As the location
for regional headquarters of Power Corp and the Gas and Fuel Corporation,
all necessary energy infrastructure for industry is in place.
<H2>Competitive land and office accommodation</H2>

<P>
Bendigo offers industry competitively priced office and house
rental accommodation.  A number of industrial estates throughout
the region offer sites and completed commercial properties (eg.
Mayfair Park Estate, Long Gully Estate).
<P>
Commercial property developers are willing to discuss specific
requirements and funding arrangements for any potential commercial
development.  Property values are markedly lower in Bendigo compared
to Melbourne and some other provincial centres.
<P>
Renting an average
three bedroom home costs $140 per week, compared with $200 per
week in Melbourne.  These savings on property or rental and transport
costs for employees effectively mean a higher level of disposable
income.
<H2>R&D centre</H2>

<P>
Bendigo's particular area of expertise is in precision engineering
and natural resource research.  Australian Defence Industries
has a reputation for utilising advanced engineering skills and
a strong record of technological development in defence.
<P>
Studies have identified technology intensive activities that could
be promoted in specialist fields to extend and reinforce links
between enterprises and La Trobe University, Bendigo.  Research
and development in Bendigo has had positive results.  For example,
the university worked closely with the local water authority to
upgrade the region's water effluent treatment.
<H2>Value-added potential</H2>

<P>
The rural sector includes wool production, cereal grain production,
pig, poultry, dairying and some horticulture.
<P>
Bendigo offers great potential to support value-added industries
like food processing and the processing of hides and skins. With
its access to the north-central rural production, for example,
Bendigo offers excellent possibilities for a tanning industry
and an abattoir. 
<P>
Pig processing is also big business.
Concentrated in the Bendigo District, it offers many opportunities
for growth in value-added industries. It also provides an example
of how local research bodies work closely with industry to improve
a product. The Bendigo Regional Veterinary Laboratory has a Porcine
Research Unit conducting research relevant to pig farming.
<P>
Greater Bendigo's access to Melbourne, availability of land and
the commitment of local councils have made it an attractive location
for poultry farming. Some major poultry farms and processing units
have already been relocated or developed there. These companies
include Hazeldene's Chicken Farm Pty Ltd, Crystal Egg Company,
Loddon Valley Eggs and Hy-Line Australia.
<H2>Service industries</H2>
<P>
Bendigo's role as a major service centre started with the discovery
of gold in 1851. The rush that followed was an enormously significant
event in the city's history. As it grew to become the centre of
economic activity in the region, it also developed its service
capabilities. Bendigo is now the service centre for northern and
central Victoria.
<P>
Bendigo has a strong and vibrant retail base, centred on the Central
Business District and well supported by large shopping centres
at Strathdale, Kangaroo Flat and Eaglehawk. The retail and commercial
sectors have grown rapidly over recent years. Australia's major
retail chains are represented in Bendigo.
<P>
Bendigo is the largest non-metropolitan financial centre in Australia,
because it is home to all the major banks and the Bendigo Bank.
Established in 1858, the &quot;Bendigo&quot;
has led the growth in the financial sector. Bendigo's retail catchment
area extends to Cohuna, Deniliquin, Swan Hill, Boort, Seymour
and Woodend, with an estimated population of over 140,000.
<P>
Opportunities exist for speciality shops and personal services
to be established. Bendigo is a major service provider to rural
industry, and it has a variety of primary, secondary and tertiary
education institutions.
<P>
Bendigo Senior Secondary College is the largest senior secondary
college in Victoria, providing Victorian Certificate of Education
Year 11 and 12 and offering 43 out of a total 44 VCE subjects,
the most comprehensive provision of subjects in the State.
<P>
Two major private secondary colleges, Girton Grammar School and
Catholic College, as well as several smaller institutions, ensure
an excellent choice of nonGovernment educational institutions.
<P>
A great scope of higher and vocational education is offered through
the La Trobe University-Bendigo and the Loddon-Campaspe College
of TAFE.  Bendigo has two fully equipped hospitals, one public
and one private, that provide about three hundred beds.  Sixty
doctors and twenty-five dentists practise in the area, and the
region is home to a multitude of paramedical services.
<P>
An extensive network of community support services and facilities
is available to all age groups.
<H2>Tourism a winner</H2>

<P>
One of Bendigo's prime assets is its climate.  Because it is located
on the northern fringe of the Great Dividing Range, it enjoys
a mild climate all year.  Bendigo averages 256 rain-free days
per year and the mean average temperature ranges from 29 degrees
Celsius in January to 12 degrees Celsius in July.  Extremes of'climate,
such as snow and strong winds, are almost non-existent.
<P>
Taking the region's vast tourist, recreation and leisure attractions
into account, the industry has huge growth potential.
<P>
Apart from a number of 19th and early 20th century buildings of
a standard that cannot be matched in Australia, Bendigo has award-winning
tourist facilities such as the Central Deborah Gold Mine, vintage
'talking trams', the Golden Dragon Chinese Museum and the famous
Bendigo Pottery.
<P>
Tourist accommodation and restaurants offer diverse development
opportunities and the convention and events market also has great
growth potential.
