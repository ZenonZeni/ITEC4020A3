<p>Analysis is used to evaluate the various possible scenarios for 
integrating 
hydrogen into the energy economy.  In order for hydrogen to gain 
commercial 
acceptance, in niche markets and in the national energy mix, hydrogen 
energy 
systems must compare favorably on an economic, efficiency, and 
environmental 
basis with competing energy carriers and systems.  The goal of analysis 
is to 
provide direction and support to the DOE Hydrogen Program by evaluating 
the 
technical and economic benefits and drawbacks of various hydrogen 
production, 
storage, transport, and use technologies.  The economic competitiveness 
of a new 
technology can be assessed by comparing its estimated costs to the costs 
of 
technologies that are currently being used.  This provides a basis for 
determining 
which technologies have the best potential for near-, mid-, and long-term 
success in 
the marketplace.  For a technical summary of an analysis project on the 
development of hydrogen technologies, select any of these main topics:
