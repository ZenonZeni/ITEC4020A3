ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAW AND MINORITY EMPLOYMENT: RECRUITMENT PRACTICES AND
REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS by Farrell Bloch. Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 1994. 148 pp. Cloth $19.95. <BR>

When Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the unemployment rate
for black men and women was double that for whites. Much of this difference,
proponents of the Act argued, was the result of discrimination by employers,
unions, and employment agencies. By prohibiting such discrimination, Title
VII of the Act was to win access for blacks to jobs formerly closed to them
-- it would reduce black unemployment and enable them to move along with
whites on the road to economic success. <BR>
<BR>
More than thirty years later, after the development of new, sweeping definitions
of discrimination, the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars to
enforce Title VII and other equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws and
regulations, and victory by black workers in thousands of employment discrimination
cases, the unemployment rate for black men and women is -- double that for
whites.<BR>
<BR>
It is this conundrum which motivates Farrell Bloch's book. Why has EEO law
(including, for our purposes, executive orders and regulations) proven to
be so ineffectual? Why have the hopes of those who fought so long and so
hard for Title VII not been fulfilled?<BR>
<BR>
Bloch proposes four reasons. First, although the federal government apparently
has the power to get employers it monitors closely -- large employers and
federal contractors -- to hire more blacks, the blacks they recruit are
apparently those who would be employed anyway, at smaller firms and firms
without federal contracts. The latter apparently do NOT make up for their
loss of black employees by hiring from among the black unemployed. Net result:
no gain in total black employment. <BR>
<BR>
Second, Bloch claims, the EEO laws may actually discourage employers from
hiring blacks. Although the laws prohibit discrimination both in hiring
and on the job, applicants are much less likely than employees to file discrimination
lawsuits. For employers, therefore, it may make sense to avoid hiring potentially
litigious applicants in the first place. <BR>
<BR>
Third, much hiring is done through word-of-mouth recruitment. With proportionately
more whites and Asians than blacks in a position to hire (because they control
most firms), such recruitment disadvantages blacks; yet it is difficult
to see how the EEO laws can prevent people from using their personal contacts
to find work. Finally, Bloch argues, some criteria employers use to screen
applicants exclude blacks disproportionately often -- an example is having
a criminal record.<BR>
<BR>
All of these arguments have been made before, but it is not Bloch's goal
to be original. Instead, he wants to (1) summarize what is known about the
impact of EEO law for a &quot;diverse audience, including students, human
resources professionals, and attorneys&quot; <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
as well as social scientists (p. 5); (2) place particular emphasis on how
recruitment practices affect racial differences in unemployment; and (3)
propose more effective ways of reducing black unemployment.<BR>
<BR>
Bloch's summary of others' work on the impact of EEO law would in fact be
useful for its intended audience; it is wide-ranging, accurate and easy
to comprehend. Nevertheless, it is problematic in at least two important
ways not necessarily obvious to its intended audience. <BR>
<BR>
First is Bloch's attempt to focus on unemployment rather than on earnings
or access to occupations. There are good reasons to be concerned about black-white
differences in unemployment; the unemployed not only have lower incomes
than the employed, but they are also less attached to major institutions,
less likely to form stable families, and less likely to contribute to community
life in constructive ways. Nevertheless, most work on the impact of EEO
law rightly focuses on how it affects earnings or access to occupations;
most adults are employed, and it is how well they are doing which is most
important for assessing group progress. <BR>
<BR>
As it turns out, Bloch is partially saved by his own inconsistency. He says
his focus is unemployment, but he actually summarizes work on earnings and
access to occupations as well. Bloch's readers will thus learn more than
he promises. Unfortunately, they may also come away with a somewhat confused
impression of work on EEO law because of Bloch's failure to distinguish
carefully between its impact on unemployment, on earnings, and on access
to occupations. <BR>
<BR>
The second way in which the summary is problematic lies in its treatment
of theory and evidence. Bloch presents his argument rather informally, mixing
economic theory, legal analysis, summaries of others' empirical work, U.S.
government statistics, and anecdotes about particular EEO cases. Such informality
arguably makes sense, given the intended audience. Yet such informality
may -- and in this case, does -- have a price. Much of what Bloch says about
the apparent weakness of EEO law rests on economic theory: for example,
how employers wishing to avoid being sued have incentives not to hire blacks,
or why employers find it especially efficient to recruit employees through
word-of-mouth, to the detriment of blacks. Only the most careful and methodologically
sophisticated reader is likely to notice how little hard evidence there
is to support the theoretical arguments. Most of what Bloch says will seem
plausible, or even convincing, to those inclined to accept the economic
arguments on which it rests. But those who would like to know whether it
is really true that employers resist hiring blacks because they believe
that reduces their exposure to litigation, will not find the evidence in
Bloch's book. <BR>
<BR>
To be fair, the evidence is not in Bloch's book because it is simply not
available anywhere. At times, Bloch acknowledges that his conclusion that
EEO law has had little impact could be undermined by evidence not yet available
-- evidence showing, for example, that the impact of EEO law has been underestimated
because it has been offset by the loss of manufacturing jobs, <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
the impact of inner-city crime and other factors. He fails, however, to
point out how little evidence there is for many of the points in his theoretical
argument; it would be very easy for the reader to come away from his book
thinking we understand far more about black unemployment or earnings than
we actually do.<BR>
<BR>
Bloch's book also reflects another weakness of others' work on EEO law:
like many of the economists whose work he cites, he claims to be writing
about MINORITIES, but really focuses almost entirely on MINORITY MEN. He
shows that black women as well as men suffer from much higher unemployment
rates than whites, but fails to note that their earnings and access to occupations
have improved more rapidly than black men's, almost certainly due in part
to EEO law. Indeed, black women's earnings approach those of white women,
and some social scientists have argued that although black women continue
to suffer from sex discrimination, they are harmed relatively little by
race discrimination in the labor market. <BR>
<BR>
Bloch's (and others') neglect of black women is objectionable not only in
principle, but because it affects the credibility of his argument as well.
Bloch attributes the apparent failure of EEO law in part to blacks' isolation
from jobs and recruitment networks, and in part to the incentives EEO law
inadvertently gives employers to avoid hiring members of protected groups.
His logic should apply to black women as well as men, yet they do not seemed
to be harmed to the same extent. The book would be more convincing if it
considered not only why EEO law is likely to be ineffective, but also why
it may be less ineffective for some groups than for others.<BR>
<BR>
Bloch's policy proposals are for the most part quite conventional among
economists: he argues that employment opportunities for blacks would be
improved by full employment, reducing or eliminating the minimum wage and
occupational licensing requirements, reducing taxes, expanding particular
kinds of job-training programs, reducing inner-city crime, and encouraging
the growth of black-owned businesses. His own, new proposal calls for making
it easier to disseminate information about jobs and job applicants through
interactive telephone communication of the sort people use to get information
about their bank accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Overall, Bloch's book is useful in two ways. First, he effectively summarizes
much of what we know about the impact of EEO law. Second, he argues convincingly
that social and economic processes beyond the reach of EEO law -- particularly
informal recruitment to jobs, the development of entrepreneurship in minorities
communities, and the disintegration of inner cities -- work strongly to
the disadvantage of blacks. Nevertheless, those wanting a sophisticated
and non-technical introduction to EEO law and its consequences would still
find it especially worthwhile to read Alfred Blumrosen's MODERN LAW (University
of Wisconsin Press, 1993) and the well-known exchange between James Smith
and Finis Welch on one side and John Donohue III and James Heckman on the
other (&quot;Black Economic Progress After Myrdal,&quot; <BR>
