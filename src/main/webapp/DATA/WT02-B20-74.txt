  This digest presents summary information on the characteristics and needs of
children with learning disabilities (LD).  The federal definition of learning
disabilities is given and the existences of differences at the state level
noted.  Next viewpoints on various issues are briefly considered including the
special educational needs of students with LD characteristics and low average
intelligence, high intelligence, or from different linguistic, cultural,
social, or economic backgrounds.  The last section considers principles of
education for this population including provision of a continuum of program
models, transition to the world of work and adulthood, and the need for
individualized instructional strategies.  Addresses for six organizational
resources are also provided.  (DB)<BR>

  This booklet uses hypothetical case examples to illustrate the definition,
causal theories, and specific types of learning disabilities (LD).  The
cognitive and language performance of students with LD is compared to standard
developmental milestones, and common approaches to the identification and
education of children with LD are outlined.  Research supporting or refuting
the effectiveness of various medications and diets is summarized and general
suggestions are provided for families attempting to cope with the stress of
raising a child with LD.  The outlook for the future is explored in a
discussion considering whether learning disabilities can be outgrown or cured,
a description of services available to adults with LD, and a summary of
research being sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health.  The
pamphlet concludes with a list of print resources and support groups relating
to LD.  (PB)<BR>

  The paper presents a discussion of human mental processes as they relate to
learning disabilities.  Pathognomonic symptoms associated with disturbances to
brain areas or functional systems are discussed, as well as treatment
procedures.  This brain behavior relationship is offered as a basis for a
classification system that is seen to more clearly define attention and
learning disabilities and to afford more precise and reliable strategies for
diagnosis and treatment.  Ninety-two symptoms are grouped in a screening
checklist format for the areas of attention, perception, mood, memory, and
movement.  A multidisciplinary treatment approach involving medicine,
neuropsychology, and education is recommended.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  The study assessed the utility of different factor structures of the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised in differentiating Israeli male
students (ages 6-16) with learning disability from children with emotional
disturbance.  Based on several comparisons the results indicated that only the
modified A.S.  Kaufman's factor structure differentiated the two groups.  (Author/DB)<BR>
