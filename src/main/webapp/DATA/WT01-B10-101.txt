<h2align=center>FIRST INTERNATIONAL ENDOSCOPY SYMPOSIUM</h2>
<h3 align=center>St. Petersburg, Russia</h3>
<h3 align=center>May 1993</h3>
<i><h4 align=center>by</h4>
<h3 align=center>Dr. Michael Herndon</h3></i>
Through a collaborative effort involving several specialties, a multi-disciplinary team from Georgia Baptist Medical Center Co-Directed by Dr. Mark Perloe, Dr. Michael Herndon and Anne Atkinson offered a course in ENDOSCOPY with the First St. Petersburg Medical Institute-Pavlov in the city founded by Peter the Great in 1704: St. Petersburg, Russia.  This course ran from May 10-17, 1993, during the early part of the "White Nights" when the sun rises at 3 a.m. and sets at 11:30 p.m. It was the first in what is planned to be an on going affiliation with the ST. Petersburg Medical Institute. </p>
The preparation began many months ago as Drs. Perloe, Herndon and Anne Atkinson began to work out the logistics of having an endoscopy course in a country which did not speak English, has an 8 hour time differential and was located over 5,000 miles away. No detail could be taken for granted.  All the equipment, supplies and lecture materials needed for the course had to be anticipated and shipped to Russia. None of the course directors had initially realized the amount of work it would require to take this idea of an truly international endoscopic training symposium from conception through reality.  But, to their credit, they stuck with it and the course was a complete success.  According to Dr. Herndon without the help of such people as Dr. Perloe's office staff, the staff of medical education, Alton Westberry and his department the work would not have been completed on time.  </p>
In addition the Vendor support was wonderful!  Ralf Sander of CIRCON/ACMI provided video and Laparoscopic equipment as well as technical support.  Christian Erbe of ERBE Electronics provided a wealth of information and the electrosurgical generators.  Between these two companies 6 huge wooden crates measuring 4x4x6 FEET were shipped to Russia.  Ralf and Christian brought with them not only equipment but technical expertise that was indispensable.  The enthusiasm and sheer hard work Ralf Sander of Germany, Christian Erbe of Belgium and Patrick Laughlin of Atlanta exhibited was an inspiration to all. Drs. Perloe and Herndon were heard to say on many occasions, "without these individuals, this course could not have succeeded as well as it did".  In addition, United States Surgical Company donated disposable surgical instrumentation and Baxter much needed supplies.  To all of these vendors, and many more, (Valley Lab, Organon, Carl Storz and Apple Medical to name a few)...our heart felt THANK YOU!</p>
The group from Georgia Baptist Medical Center was as listed by specialty - Gynecology: Drs. Mark Perloe, Steve Saltzman and Rhonda Latif.  General Surgery: Drs. Titus Duncan and Steve Eubanks.  Urology: Dr. Thomas Schoborg.  Comparative Medicine: Dr. Michael Herndon. Nursing: Nadra Cohran, and Research: Dr. Carole Ehleben. Translation, the key to success or failure, fell to Anne Atkinson whose fluent Russian made communication a joy.  This distinguished group was assembled not only for their expertise, which is considerable, but also because of their belief in the value of an International Endoscopy Symposium. So dedicated was this group that many of its members had to pay their own way and use vacation time for the opportunity to teach.  Each of the members of the group lived with a sponsoring Russian family while in St. Petersburg.  These families were warm and caring.  The group from Georgia Baptist has many wonderful stories to tell and I encourage the interested reader to corner one of the participants and simply ask them about their experience.  Then stand back as they talk your ear off about all the unique and varied cultural and personal impressions each brought home.</p>
The Symposium was divided into three sections: lectures, laboratory and operative.  Over 300 physicians participated in at least one of these sections.</p> 
The main lecture hall at the Institute reminded one of pictures of 150 doctors and students standing around an auditorium listening to one of the senior professors demonstrating the latest in medical theory and technique.  It was here that the course began.  After being made completely welcome by the faculty, Dr. Perloe gave his introductory remarks. The lectures that morning by Drs. Perloe, Eubanks and Herndon showed once again the importance and difficulties of a language barrier.  But through the efforts of all involved the day went smoothly.  At the outset the course directors were concerned as to whether the interest in lectures would remain.  We all realize how interest can fade on a beautiful spring afternoon.  This was not to be the case, however,  all the lectures were standing room only.  Faculty and students alike could be found in the hall waiting to take an empty chair. Specialty lectures which were intended to be limited to 18 hand picked leading Russian physicians had to be increased to 50 due to repeated requests.</p>
Their "experimental lab" was a picturesque building with a semicircular stone entrance.  Once inside the building you could not escape the feeling of time standing still.  These rooms had seen thousands of wide eyed youths (in Russia students begin a six year medical school curriculum directly out of high school) learn the fundamentals of anatomy, pathology and general surgery as they moved through their training.  It was here that 6 working stations were assembled allowing the plan for 18 participants to learn the details of the surgeries they hoped to perform.</p>  
Once again the instructors had to rise to the occasion of literally hundreds of medical students parading through in an effort to actually witness a technology that none of them had ever seen and few knew about in any detail. An unexpectedly large turnout of Surgeons from the  St. Petersburg Medical Institute, as well as several from surrounding hospitals, caused the huge lab facility to swell with activity. During this section the details of Endometrial Ablation, Hysteroscopy, resection of Leiomyomas and general Laparoscopy were taught by Drs. Perloe, Saltzman and Latif.  Drs. Duncan and Eubanks gave detailed instructions on principals and practices of general laparoscopy as well as how to avoid potential complications.  For Dr. Schoborg the challenges were just beginning.  After spending considerable time with a team of highly qualified and extremely motivated Urologists on the details of Laparoscopy and Pelvic Lymphadenectomy he then accompanied them to their facility.  Upon arrival he discovered a very modern Lithotriptor for breaking up kidney and ureteral stones using the latest in shock wave technology.  He was also about to discover they had saved for him a huge, rock hard stone lodged tightly in a patients ureter.  Another area in which actively persued was nursing education.  Under the experienced hand of Nadra Cochran R.N., a team of Russian nurses who had expressed an interest in Laparoscopy were taught how to prepare for and manage all the varied equipment and instrumentation necessary for safe Endoscopic surgery.  Carole Ehleben was able to successfully initiate efforts to bring controlled clinical trials to Pavlov so that the Institute might benefit from the revenues and advanced technology which accompany such studies.</p>
Imagine moving all the equipment needed for an operating room across a campus over roads which have so many potholes that a cart cannot roll. Imagine having to move each piece of equipment by hand.  Now multiply that by 6 operating rooms and you have some idea of the work that had to be done.  In the space of one evening all the necessary equipment required to safely perform multiple laparoscopic techniques had to be mobilized and moved into the operating theater.  No amount of thanks can repay Dr. Herndon, Ralf Sander, Christian Erbe and Patrick Laughlin for their efforts.  But move they did and all was ready for some of the first Laparoscopic Surgeries and the FIRST Laparoscopic Herniorrhaphy in St. Petersburg's history (Drs Duncan and Eubanks). </p>
As is the medical standard in the United States, the physicians first watched Drs. Perloe, Duncan, Saltzman, Eubanks, Schoborg and Latif operate.  Next they assisted under the watchful eye of our surgeons.  Surgeries included: Laparoscopically Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy, Endoscopic Evaluation of the Uterus, Laparoscopic evaluation of causes of infertility, Laparoscopic removal of a Gall Bladder, Laparoscopic repair of an Inguinal Hernia and the Endoscopic examination of Ureteral obstruction due to a ureteral stone.  </p>
Finally, they performed one of the first Laparoscopic Cholecystectomies completely on their own.  All the patients recovered quickly and without complication.</p>
The symposium received much media attention in St. Petersburg.  A description of the course was included in 3 newspaper articles, several radio news reports, a live radio program and 2 television reports. </p>
Looking back at the experiences of the group, it is not possible to evaluate all that was learned on both sides.  The Russians treated us like family.  They were gracious to a fault.  We found them to be extremely knowledgeable, merely lacking the access to the technologies we take for granted. We had hoped to find colleagues, what we found were friends.</p>
To all of those who participated in the first International Endoscopic Training Symposium the Georgia Baptist Medical Centers welcomes you back and ...CONGRATULATIONS ON A JOB WELL DONE!!!</p>
