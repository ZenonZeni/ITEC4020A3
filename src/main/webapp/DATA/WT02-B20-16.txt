Parents can have a strong positive influence on their child's
reading. Research has shown that enjoying books with a child for even
a few minutes a day can make a measurable difference in the
acquisition of basic reading skills, and that everyday activities - 
such as a trip to the grocery store - can be turned into enjoyable
learning experiences. <P>

Following is a list of ways in which parents can encourage the
development of the  skills needed by children in order for them to
become good readers.  <P>

<b>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Find time to read aloud with your child every day. Typically,
parents play an important role in developing this skill by reading to
children and showing how important reading is to their daily life.
Lap time with picture books and stories can strongly motivate your
child to enjoy reading. Try to make these books available for your
children to explore and enjoy on their own as well.</ul><P>


<b>Develop Awareness of Printed Language </b><P>

<ul> <li> Teach about books. When reading aloud to your child, let your child
open the book and turn the pages. Point to the words as you read.
Draw attention to repeated phrases, inviting your child to join in
each time they occur. <P>
  
<li> Point out letters and words that you run across in daily life. Make
an obvious effort to read aloud traffic signs, billboards, notices,
labels on packages, maps, and phone numbers. Make outings a way to
encourage reading by showing your child how printed words relate to
daily living.</ul><P>


<b>Learn the Alphabet </b><P>

<ul> <li> Play alphabet games. Sing the alphabet song to help your child learn
letters as you play with alphabet books, blocks, and magnetic
letters. Recite letters as you go up and down stairs or give pushes
on a swing. A-B-C, dot-to-dot and letter-play workbooks, games, and
puzzles are available at most toy stores. Many engaging computer
games are designed for teaching children letters. Make sure these
toys are available even when you are unable to play along.<P>
 
<li> Watch "Sesame Street" with your child. Show the child how to sing
along, answer the riddles, and engage actively in its fun.<P>

<li> Make writing materials available to your child and encourage their
use. Help your child learn to write his/her name and other important
words or phrases. Gradually, help the child learn to write more and
more letters. At first, most children find it easier to write
uppercase letters.</ul> <P>

 
<b>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Teach your child to spell a few special words, such as his/her name,
"stop," or "exit." Challenge the child to read these words every
place they are seen. Draw attention to these and other frequently
occurring words as you read books with your child. Challenge the
child to read these words as they arise or to search them out on a
page. Play word-building games with letter tiles or magnetic letters.
Have the child build strings of letters for you to read.</ul><P>


<b>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and Phonemes</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Sing songs and read rhyming books. Sing the alphabet with your
child, and teach your child songs that emphasize rhyme and
alliteration, such as "Willaby Wallaby Woo" and "Down By the Sea."
Emphasize the sounds as you sing. Play rhyming games and clap out
names. Jumble the wording or word order of familiar poems and
challenge your child to detect the error. Talk like a robot, syllable
by syllable.<P>
 
<li> Play word games. Challenge your child to play with words. For
example, ask your child to  think of words that rhyme with "bat" or
begin with /m/. What would be left if you took the /k/ sound out of
"cat"? What would you have if you put these sounds together: /p/ and
ickle; /m/ and ilk; and /s/, /a/, and /t/. Which of these words
starts with a different sound -- "bag", "candy", "bike"? Do "boat"
and "baby" start with the same sound?</ul><P>


<b>Learn Letter Sounds</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Sound out letters. Point out other words that begin with the same
letter as your child's name, drawing attention to the similarities of
the begining sound. Use alphabet books, computer games, or car games
such as, "I'm thinking of something that starts with /b/" to engage
the child in alliterative and letter-sound play. If you have a book
that lends itself to alliteration and rhyme, such as a Dr. Seuss
book, sound out rhyming words as you read or challenge the child to
do so for you. Play word games that connect sounds with syllables and
words. For example: If this spells "cat," how do you spell "hat"?</ul><P>


<b>Sound Out New Words </b><P>

<ul> <li> Point out new words.  As you encounter them, say the sound while
touching each letter in a new word. For example, say "s-u-n" and then
blend sounds to create the word. In practicing new words, use
predictable words with common sounds and spellings, like "fun" or
"sat" instead of "night" or "saw." <P>
 
<li> If you encounter words with unknown meanings or with complex
spellings, encourage your child to try to sound out the words.
However, if too many words require this kind of attention and effort,
it is best to find an easier book.<P>
 
<li> Play spelling games with your child. After your child begins
pronouncing words, encourage spelling by saying each sound in the
words and then writing the letter that goes with the sound.<P>
 
<li> Encourage your child to spell. After your child has learned to
pronounce words, have the child say each sound.<P>
 
<li> Independent writing. Encourage your child to use inventive or
independent spelling. At this stage, the child will tend to omit
letters and confuse letter names with letter sounds, producing such
spellings as LFNT for elephant, BN for bean, and FARE for fairy. Use
correction wisely. You should be most concerned about is the child's
sensitivity to the sounds that need to be represented.</ul><P>
 

<b>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Help your children to read easy, enjoyable stories as often as
possible.  It is likely that your child will enjoy reading more and
learn more from reading if you sit together, taking turns reading and
encouraging discussion. In the beginning, invite the child to read
well-chosen words. Gradually, as the child becomes able, take turns
with sentences, speakers, paragraphs, and pages. At the end of each
section or story, revisit those words that caused trouble. Rereading
the entire story over several days, and again weeks later, is a
powerful way to reinforce this learning. </ul><P>
 

<b>Know Spelling Patterns</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Now it becomes useful to point out the similarities between words
such as will, fill, and hill or light, night, and sight. This is also
the time to help your child learn the correct spelling of the words
he/she writes.</ul><P>
 

<b>Learn to Read Reflectively</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Pause for discussions as you read. As you read stories to and with
your child, stop frequently to discuss their language, content, and
relevance to real life and other knowledge. Pause to explore the
meanings of new words, using them in other sentences and contrasting
what they mean with words that have similar meanings. Make an effort
to revisit new words and concepts later, when the book has been put
aside. When reading stories, pause to discuss the various characters,
problems, events in the story, and invite your child to think about
how the problems might be solved or to wonder about what might happen
next. When resuming a story, ask your child to review what has
happened so far, drawing attention to looming mysteries and
unresolved conflicts. In reading expository text, invite the child to
marvel at the creatures or events described and to wonder about
details or connections not mentioned by the text. </ul><P>

<b>Above all: Read, read, and re-read </b><P>
