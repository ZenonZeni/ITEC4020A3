<TITLE>Storage And Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H2>Storage And Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel</H2><HR>
In 1982, Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and as amended in 1987, outlined a comprehensive plan for the management and safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other forms of high-level radioactive waste. The Department of Energy, through its Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, was given the responsibility for planning, constructing, and operating such a disposal system. <P>
<P>
Nuclear power plants safely store radioactive materials using a variety of proven technologies. Such storage, particularly for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, must protect those who work and live nearby from radiation. Until a permanent geologic repository is in operation, spent nuclear fuel will continue to be stored in specially designed water filled pools and above-ground dry storage facilities. <P>

<H3>What Is Being Stored? </H3>

To produce electricity using nuclear fission, which converts mass to energy, nuclear power plants use solid, ceramic-like pellets of enriched uranium, slightly larger than pencil erasers, stacked atop each other and sealed in strong metal tubes, called fuel rods. The rods are 3.5-4.5 meters (12-15 feet) long, and are bundled together in groups of about 200 to form nuclear fuel assemblies. These fuel assemblies, when placed inside a nuclear reactor where the fission process takes place, produce heat that is used to generate steam and make electricity.<P>
<P>
After three or four years in an operating nuclear reactor, the energy remaining inside the pellets is no longer efficient enough to produce usable heat. Used, or "spent" nuclear fuel assemblies are removed from the reactor and replaced with fresh fuel. The spent nuclear fuel assemblies have become highly radioactive during the fission process and must be isolated from the environment for long periods of time. It takes thousands of years for the radiation to naturally decrease to the acceptable levels already found in nature. <P>

<H3>Current Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage</H3>

Each nuclear power plant has facilities on site to temporarily store spent nuclear fuel as it comes out of the reactor. Although the spent nuclear fuel is highly radioactive, there are relatively low volumes of it at each site. Most fuel is placed in large pools of water contained in steel-lined concrete basins. Besides helping to cool the spent nuclear fuel, water provides protection from radiation for plant workers and the public. <P>
<P>
Other methods of storing spent nuclear fuel at the reactor site do not involve water. Spent nuclear fuel assemblies can be stored in a "dry" environment above-ground using heavy containers or casks made of steel and/or concrete. Casks are either placed upright on concrete pads, or stored horizontally in metal canisters in concrete bunkers. Like pool storage, dry storage has been proven safe but is not intended to be a permanent solution.<P>

<H3>Interim Storage Options/Plans For The Future</H3>

As a step toward final disposal, the Department of Energy is ready to respond to policy redirection related to interim storage. An interim storage facility could serve as a collection point for temporarily storing some of the nation's spent nuclear fuel until a permanent repository is built. (Congressional legislation was considered in July 1996 designating an interim storage site at the Nevada Test Site.  The proposed bill was passed by the Senate by a vote of 63-37, but was not voted on in the House of Representatives) <P>

Another option that the Department of Energy had explored was a special container-based system known as a <A HREF="/pages/resource/facts/mpcfct.htm">multi-purpose canister</A> or an MPC.  The MPC concept built upon storage technologies already in operation and demonstrated to be safe, and would have allowed for spent nuclear fuel to be handled only once prior to storage, transportation, and disposal. (In response to budgetary constraints for the civilian radioactive waste management program in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM did not pursue development of an MPC system beyond the initial design stage.) <P>

<H3>Permanent Solutions </H3>
Many options have been studied to determine the best environment for isolating radiation over long periods of time. For instance, leaving the waste at the reactor site, burying it in the ocean floor, putting it in polar ice sheets, and rocketing it into outer space were all considered. Most scientific organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences and U.S. Geological Survey, have recommended underground geologic disposal as the permanent solution. <P>
<P>
In the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, Congress directed the Department of Energy to concentrate site characterization studies at <A HREF="http://www.ymp.gov/">Yucca Mountain, Nevada</A>. Yucca Mountain is in an arid climate about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The proposed depth of the repository is about 300 meters (1,000 feet) below the surface, but still about 240 meters (800 feet) above the water table in a very hard rock called volcanic tuff. Scientists are studying the mountain and its structure by examining the geology at the surface, removing core and water samples by drilling deep into the mountain, digging trenches, and studying sound waves as they move through the rock. Tunneling into Yucca Mountain is being conducted in order to construct an Exploratory Studies Facility, where scientists can get a better understanding of the characteristics of the rock inside the mountain. <P>
<P>
The process of site characterization is very detailed and will require many years of research, testing and evaluation. The current schedule in the OCRWM program shows that a viability assessment of Yucca Mountain will be prepared by 1998, and the repository will start operations in 2010. If at any time DOE or the teams of scientists discover the site to be unsuitable, they will stop characterization activity, restore the area, and report to Congress within six months on a recommended course of action. <P>
