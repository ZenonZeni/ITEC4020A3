In 1982 a natural experiment in legal change began in Canada when Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau, pursuing both personal and political aims, succeeded
in appending a Charter of Rights and Freedoms to Canada's patriated constitution.
The British North American Act of 1867, which established Confederation,
dealt primarily with the division of powers between the country's federal
and provincial governments. The Charter transformed this &quot;governments'
constitution&quot; into a &quot;people's constitution&quot; (Cairns 1991).
Within a decade the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, according to Russell
(1992, 35), had become &quot;a major factor in Canadian public life&quot;
and while the media and academic journals were soon &quot;stuffed with Charter
chatter,&quot; much of it approving, acclaim for the Charter has never been
universal.<BR>
<BR>
Many politicians and academics greeted it with caution, ambivalence, or
denunciation. As experience with the Charter and research of its effects
have accumulated, the number of &quot;Charter skeptics&quot; (Knopff and
Morton 1992) drawn from both the political right and left appears to have
grown. With COURTS AND COUNTRY, W. A. Bogart, a law professor at the University
of Windsor, joins the ranks of these skeptics. After a sweeping survey of
litigation and the role of the judiciary in Canada, Bogart concludes the
Charter was a &quot;mistake.&quot; In reaching this conclusion, Bogart pulls
together the objections of the right that the Charter threatens to strengthen
the role of judicial review at the expense of representative government
with accusations from the left that the Charter will fail to meet the aspirations
for equality expressed by the disadvantaged and marginalized. Bogart's principal
contribution to the debate over the Charter is his effort to broaden the
debate's scope to include areas of the law outside the Charter's boundaries.
He thus addresses the larger problem of not just the Charter's actual impact
regarding social reform and the balance between parliamentary and judicial
powers but the effects that an emergent political discourse framed in terms
of rights, a possibly growing reliance on litigation as a means of social
change, and more generally the &quot;juridicalization of politics&quot;
(Shapiro 1994) might have on the vitality of Canada's democracy.<BR>
<BR>
Bogart organizes his book into four parts. The first part is a chapter that
sketches in quick strokes Canada's diverse political cultures, regional
and linguistic differences, ambivalent identities as a nation and people,
traditional deference to authority, and an economy in which until recently
competition has been muted and government involvement welcomed. The chapter's
dominant theme is that Canada's &quot;variegated ideology&quot; fostered
a &quot;pragmatic and empirical&quot; politics that historically has encouraged
the accommodation and compromise required to preserve Canada's unity and
which has been <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
needed to attain the constitutional ends of &quot;peace, order, and good
government.&quot; This variegated ideology, mixing in unequal proportions
the founding fragments of classical liberalism and Toryism with later elements
of social democracy, colored the content of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms
so that liberalism's individualism, the dominant fragment, was mitigated
by the absence of property rights and offset by the inclusion of group rights
and affirmative remedies that reflected Canada's communitarian or collective
values. The Charter thus appears to have created opportunities for progressive
forces to use the courts to promote these values. <BR>
<BR>
No opportunity is without risk, however. Bogart fears that the Canadian
judiciary is an unreliable ally for progressive causes and that pursuing
a rights strategy through the Charter may erode the communitarian seam in
Canada's public philosophy that has made its politics responsive to social
democratic demands. He introduces his general concerns in two chapters that
make up the second part of the book. The first chapter draws heavily from
the American literature to underscore the problematic impacts of law reform
(e.g., Handler 1978) and of high court decisions (e.g., Rosenberg 1991)
in order to question popular beliefs in the power of litigation and courts
as levers for social change. The second chapter focuses on the structure
of litigation, its liberal individualist underpinnings which weaken it as
a platform for social or political reforms, and the spotty record of Canada's
courts and legislatures regarding expanded notions of standing, class actions,
interventions, remedies, and costs that would redefine the cramped structure
of the traditional model. <BR>
<BR>
In these chapters Bogart presents the equivalent of a Catch 22 to define
the limits of litigation in Canada. If the pursuit of progressive causes
through the courts fails or produces little more than ambiguous or modest
results, as Bogart believes the American experience shows, then the Charter
of Rights and Freedoms is a chimera and litigation a fool's errand for minorities
and the marginalized. If, however, litigation does succeed, its price may
be pernicious for democratic politics in Canada. By turning to the courts
to resolve major issues and learning to live with an expansive judiciary,
Canadians may develop a &quot;habit of mind&quot; that expects little of
politics. A Gresham's Law, Bogart seems to suggest, links litigation and
politics in which faith in law and the courts drives out confidence in democratic
participation, thus sapping the political will of the vitality required
to resolve contentious issues. Bogart, in essence, takes the &quot;neo-realist&quot;
critique which focuses on the questionable and limited benefits of litigation
and combines it with &quot;structuralist&quot; criticisms that argue that
litigation weakens or diverts progressive movements (McCann 1994) to create
a synthesis that redefines and broadens the terms of the debate over law
and courts in Canada. <BR>
<BR>
The book's third and longest part provides the substance for Bogart's argument.
In six chapters Bogart ranges across the legal landscape, surveying at various
points the judiciary's role in Canada's administrative state, the fate of
women's issues and abortion in the courts before and after the Charter,
the <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
debate over tort and no-fault regimes in Canada, the drift toward the due
process model in criminal law under the Charter, the courts' changing role
in federal relations since Confederation, and, finally, equality litigation
and aboriginal rights under the Charter and whether the Charter is judicializing
Canadian politics. Bogart arranges these chapters like a fugue in that each
chapter has a similar format which is then repeated in more or less contrapuntal
fashion. Two contrasting models or perspectives are introduced; Canada's
location or movement vis-a-vis the models is considered; the research and
arguments about the Charter's impact or effects of court decisions are weighed;
then Bogart closes the discussion by pointing to the risks of blindly accepting
the mystique of the law, courts, and Charter. <BR>
<BR>
An example of this format is the chapter on criminal law. Bogart uses the
due process and crime control models to frame his discussion of how Canada's
Supreme Court through the Charter has applied the exclusionary rule with
uncertain results and how the Court's ruling on delay prompted a political
uproar when over 40,000 criminal charges were dismissed in Ontario. In wrapping
up this discussion Bogart proceeds to ponder the premonitions American research
raise about the elusive effects of the Warren Court decisions and what a
similar &quot;due process trajectory&quot; might mean for Canadian politics
and the problems Canada's high court creates when it cloaks itself in the
mantle of policy maker to make broad, far-reaching decisions transcending
the immediate issues of the cases it is deciding. The leit motif of this
third part is that Canada's courts, unlike its legislatures, historically
have not been especially hospitable forums for progressive causes and that
even when the courts act favorably the success is short-lived or offset
by unanticipated consequences. <BR>
<BR>
In his concluding chapter and the book's fourth part, Bogart worries that
despite this historical record Canadians, particularly the powerless and
marginalized, will be drawn to the courts by the allure of litigation and
charms of the Charter expecting to find &quot;shelter in a forum that will
respond to their pleas.&quot; These hopes, he fears, will &quot;stumble
over reality.&quot; In his estimation experience and research fail to show
the &quot;courts have ever been responsible for long-lasting and effective
social or political change.&quot; He later postulates that &quot;if it is
the case that the more we judicialize fundamental social and political questions,
the more we enervate politics, then it is also likely that the more we limit
the judiciary, the more politics will need to respond to the discontents
that make recourse to the courts seem so tempting or at least necessary.&quot;
His solution is to shove the litigiousness genie back into a common law
bottle that confines the judiciary to the &quot;core functions&quot; of
courts. If courts only make as much law as needed to resolve disputes and
this law can be changed or overturned by legislatures, the perils of substituting
litigation for politics might be avoided. <BR>
<BR>
The tools for making this solution, ironically, seem at hand in the Charter
itself where section 33 gives Canada's legislatures the authority to override
court decisions and section 1 balances rights and freedoms against the justifiable
limits of a democratic society. Section 33, however, soon fell into deep
disfavor in English-speaking Canada after <BR>
<BR>
Page 23 follows: <BR>
<BR>
Quebec used it to block a Supreme Court language decision. Efforts to restore
the section's good standing, given the extent to which rights talk has permeated
Canada's political consciousness, might be interpreted as an attack on judicial
independence, a central tenet of the new legal culture taking root in Canada.
Section 1 simply creates a &quot;Charter Two Step&quot; in the Supreme Court's
deliberations while failing to check the Court's interpretative leeway (Knopf
and Morton 1992, 35-60). <BR>
<BR>
Another difficulty that is unrelated to the Charter is the contradiction
between Bogart's urging that the traditional model of litigation be revamped
to make it more inclusive and accessible, which would increase its attractiveness
as a social reform strategy, and his concern that Canadians increasingly
place problems before the courts that would be best left to the legislatures.
Bogart offers additional suggestions, which echo proposals made by other
Charter skeptics (e.g., Beatty 1990), such as making the Supreme Court more
representative, involving Parliament in the selection of judges, and reforming
Canada's Senate, but they have the appearance of being intended to prompt
discussion; they are not discussed in detail nor are they integrated into
the book's argument in convincing ways. <BR>
<BR>
Bogart wrote his book to caution Canadians about the dangers of broadening
and deepening the judiciary's role in settling major political questions
and of giving courts final say over constitutional matters that can only
be overcome by constitutional amendment. It is not surprising then that
the book has a polemical flavor. One major limitation is that Bogart did
not collect fresh information to support his argument; he offers no systematic
evidence on litigation trends or on changes in political participation,
two empirical phenomena relevant to his thesis, and he provides no measures
of how juridicalized Canadian discourse has become since the Charter, relying
instead on academic opinions and anecdotes from the media. The book's foundation
rests on the ground covered by the published literature, an understandable
site given the book's breadth but also one that is not entirely secure.
Bogart acknowledges this problem several times in his discussion and points
to the limited social science research in Canada dealing with such matters
as alternative dispute resolution, administrative tribunals, abortion, tort,
prison litigation, and even recent court decisions involving federalism.
<BR>
<BR>
A second limitation is the absence of any description of the institutional
features of Canada's legal system and only scattered remarks about its dynamics.
This becomes a problem for readers unfamiliar with the country but the larger
issue for all readers is that the legal system simply becomes a &quot;black
box&quot; in Bogart's analysis. Perhaps a brief example will illustrate
the problem. Seats on the Supreme Court are apportioned on a regional basis
(which Bogart does not mention) to reflect Canada's major political cleavage,
and the justices' decisions reflect their provincial origins (Tate and Sittiwong
1989). Bogart's suggestion that the bench be made more representative means
either that this longstanding practice must be dropped thus exacerbating
regional tensions, or the new justices would continue to be selected on
a regional basis but with expectations that <BR>
<BR>
Page 24 follows: <BR>
<BR>
their decisions would reflect not provincial perspectives but the interests
of their gender or ethnicity, a potential double bind for the justices and
a further complication of Canada's cross-cutting cleavages. Bogart also
does not consider that Ottawa could apply the brakes to judicial activism
and discourage Charter litigation through its appointments to the federal
courts. Bushnell's (1992) study of Canada's Supreme Court, a &quot;captive
court&quot; long bound by a restraintist tradition before the Charter, is
a reminder that the country's courts are very much what the governments
of the day want to make of them. <BR>
<BR>
Bogart's argument, however, has a larger problem, and it has two aspects.
First, his book can be read in terms of the emerging literature dealing
with &quot;institutional choice&quot; (Komesar 1994). Bogart turns repeatedly
to the question of whether the Charter and attitudes about litigation have
tipped the balance between courts and legislatures as institutional alternatives
with the consequence that courts now deal with problems they are inherently
incapable of solving efficiently or effectively. Aside from the need to
show that this is indeed what is happening in Canada, Bogart fails to struggle
with the problem of identifying the criteria that would define the optimal
balance between litigation and politics as ways of resolving disputes or
pursuing particular societal values. It could be countered that Bogart's
recommendation that the courts return to a common law function approximates
a solution to this problem. Yet, his solution harbors a static conception
of the relationship between courts and litigation; it begs the question
of whether and how the solution could be kept in place. It is here perhaps
that the book's polemical purpose gets in the way of its theoretical development.
The second aspect of this larger problem is Bogart's pessimistic view of
rights talk and the juridicalization of Canadian political discourse. Recent
studies by McCann (1994) focusing on the movement for pay equity and by
Melnick (1994) on welfare rights in the United States strongly indicate
that labeling claims as rights offers politically weak groups considerable
leverage in common law settings similar to Bogart's solution where courts
cannot trump legislatures. Equally important are the findings that litigation
is rarely pursued to the exclusion of other political activities and that
the two strategies can be complementary. <BR>
