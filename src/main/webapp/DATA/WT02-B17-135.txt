<H2>The McNeil Plant Fires Up</H2>
<P>
John Irving is well acquainted with the inner and outer workings
of the McNeil Generating Station, which will serve as the host
site for the Department of Energy's (DOE) first industrial scale-up
and demonstration of the Battelle gasification process. His involvement
began with plant design in 1979, to Project Engineer during the
construction phase, and finally, to Plant Superintendent in 1985
when the plant's managing entity, Burlington Electric Company,
offered him that position.
<P>
Irving believes using wood as fuel has brought many benefits to
the region. "We've done good things for the environment.
Our emissions are very, very low and have become the standard
by which other plants are judged. I think we've done a lot for
the local economy."
<P>
"The problem we're having right now is that it's hard to
compete economically with low-cost oil and coal," he says.
"If this technology will allow wood again to be a competitive
source of energy, I'm pretty excited about it... it'll kind of
put us back in the viability column again."
<P>
Most of the plant's 40 employees have been around since McNeil
was commissioned in 1984. As a dispatched plant, the McNeil personnel
wait for their daily phone call from the New England Power Pool
to find out when, and if, they will go on line the next day. Right
now, other available power sources--nuclear, oil, coal--are cheaper
alternatives when considering only the price of the fuel, which
has a lot to do with why McNeil is not a baseload plant.
<P>
Operating a wood-fired plant that often starts up at 4:00 a.m.
can bring some extra noise and dust to a neighborhood--and McNeil
sits in the middle of a Burlington neighborhood. Irving cites
creative solutions--silencers on the silencers, strobe lights instead
of beepers on the front-end loaders, containment systems for ash
and sawdust--for keeping complaints to minimum. And the neighbors
know that each January they can make their annual contribution
to Mount Balsam--the huge pile of discarded Christmas trees that
gets chipped up and burned as fuel in McNeil's boiler.
<P>
Approximately 75% of McNeil's regular wood supply is in the form
of chips made from the residue portions (the tops and bark) of
harvested trees, or trees removed for thinning operations so that
the better trees have room to grow; it is material that has no
higher market value. Burlington Electric employs four degreed
foresters who supervise the wood harvesting. They work closely
with Vermont's Department of Fish and Wildlife to develop a harvest
prescription, and follow through by visiting harvest sites at
least weekly during the cutting phases to ascertain that the prescription
is being followed.
<P>
These same foresters are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate
volume of wood flows to McNeil. This can be challenging when considering
all the variables involved--for example, storing wood too long
can cause fermentation, and prices in the wood market change quickly
and impact the cost of power to McNeil, which impacts whether
the plant will even be operating.
<P>
The reasons that DOE and its cost-share partner, Future Energy
Resources, view McNeil as an ideal site to prove this gasifier
technology are clear. In Irving's words, "Most of the problems
you have with a wood-fuel plant involve getting the wood to the
system and getting the ash away from the system. That's going
to be pretty much the same whether it's a regular boiler or a
gasifier, and I think we've got pretty good experience in how
to do that."
