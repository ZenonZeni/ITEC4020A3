NEWS: GRANADA SET FOR FINAL TILT AT FORTE

Granada enters the closing stages of its campaign to buy Forte this
week with a harder job on its hands than many observers thought
probable when the hostile bid was launched.

In the face of Forte's skillfully marshalled defence, Granada must
decide by Tuesday whether to increase its cash offer of 321p per Forte
share - the City thinks at least 380p is needed - or to stick to its
guns. That means trying to convince investors that its brand of
management is what underperforming Forte needs. Unless the television-
to-motorway services group comes up with something eye-catching, what
started out with a bang risks ending with a whimper.

Forte surprised many this week by the robustness of its final offer,
according to stockbrokers' analysts. There is now a growing band which
reckons Granada must both increase its price and improve the quality
and detail of its argument.

It is not just the fact that Forte has found enough cash, thanks to the
proposed sale of its roadside cafes to Whitbread for pounds 1.05bn, to
launch a share buy-back worth pounds 800m (including the associated tax
credit). The pledge to distribute its stake in Savoy Hotels, worth 23p
a share, also increases shareholder value. After years of static
dividends, this week's promise to raise the payout 20 per cent a year
until the end of the decade was unexpected.

Forte claimed that to match the income provided under its latest
defence plan, Granada would have to raise its own dividend by 43 per
cent a year over the period. The bidder responded with its own estimate
of how easily Forte could live up to its promises. 'To cover the
dividend pledge Forte will have to double its profits over the next
three years,' said Granada finance director Henry Staunton. 'Given its
past record and the volatile nature of the business this is risky.'

Mr Staunton, questioning Forte's debt levels and highlighting the poor
returns it had made on its upmarket hotels, this week sounded
increasingly like a man preparing to tough it out, fighting on
Granada's skills and solid past record. This may be because increasing
the bid could push the bidder's debts to levels it would be
uncomfortable with. A cash bid of 380p would call for another pounds
500m, with pro-forma gearing already more than 200 per cent. Mr
Staunton and his chief executive Gerry Robinson may nevertheless regard
such debt levels as sustainable, with the cash-generating power of
Granada's ITV franchises (Granada and London Weekend) and interest
payments still covered roughly three times, as they would be at Forte.

This week Forte and its advisers stole their adversaries' rhetoric.
Whereas Granada's opening shot dwelt on the gulf in management
expertise and strategic focus between the companies, it's now Forte
which boasts that after its programme of disposals it will be the more
focused, growth-orientated company. Granada still has the option of
pledging to implement much of what Forte's management has agreed to do.
If it couples this approach with a higher offer, the argument as to
which of the two managements deserves support would be back on.

NEWS: MONEYBROKING - CITY CLUB LOSES ELITE STATUS

The New Year heralded a challenging new era for the hitherto exclusive
club of gilt market moneybrokers. Companies affected include Cater Allen -
owner of Sheppards, the largest moneybroking firm - Gerrard & National,
King & Shaxson and Union.

To help nourish the new market in gilt repos - agreements to sell and
repurchase gilts at a fixed price and on a fixed date - the Bank of
England has liberalised Stock Exchange moneybroking across the board,
with effect from 2 January, when repo trading got off to the gentlest
of starts. The Bank is keen for repos to thrive, as the ability to
issue them at will would help it fine-tune interest rate movements. In
the US, by comparison, the Federal Reserve intervenes daily in Treasury
bond repo markets.

Up to now, just eight firms have possessed a Stock Exchange
moneybroking license, allowing them to arrange for shares or gilts to
be borrowed or loaned on a short-term basis, principally by market-
makers wanting to balance their books at the end of each day's trading.
Now, any Stock Exchange member can act as a broker, and anyone can lend
or borrow. Merrill Lynch analyst Martin Green believes that, over time,
huge growth in the repo market should compensate the established
moneybrokers for a gradual loss of market share and erosion of profit
margins.

Among the quoted companies which must cope with the loss of their
'closed-shop' privileges, Cater Allen makes the most significant
proportion of its earnings from this market. In the year to last April,
43 per cent of the pounds 23.9m group profit before tax and exceptional
items came from Sheppards. Merrill Lynch forecasts pounds 20.8m this
year and a dividend of 30p, giving a PE ratio of 9 and a yield of 8.8
per cent; last year's 29p total dividend was almost twice covered.
Sheppards could be a business with appeal to an overseas buyer wanting
to move early and quickly into London's repo and related markets. Next
most exposed is Gerrard & National. It made 15 per cent of pre-
exceptional profits last year from its moneybroking franchise.

NEWS: LOOKING FOR CLUES ON THE TAKEOVER TRAIL

Industry leaders may moan about short-termism in the City, but the
plain fact is that investors love takeovers. And it's no wonder when
you look at what a determined bidder can do for the price of shares in
the target company. Last year, as ever, some of the happiest investors
were those who held shares in companies on the receiving end of
takeover bids.

Internet access provider Unipalm saw its shares rise more than four-
fold before US counterpart UUNet gained control. And shareholders in
more widely held stocks, such as Eastern Group (bought by Hanson) and
VSEL (GEC), saw bids lead to bumper profits.

Anyone who gets in ahead of the takeover action in 1996 will seriously
increase their chances of a prosperous new year. Here, then, are
Investors Chronicle's five companies most likely to attract a bid in
the coming months.

Kwik Save (500p) Dismal recent trading and a share price which has
lagged the market by almost a quarter over the past year make this a
prime takeover candidate. The group is being squeezed both by food
giants such as Sainsbury and Tesco and by foreign-owned discounters
like Netto and Aldi. Lead shareholder Dairy Farm (part of Hong Kong's
Jardine Matheson) is no longer bound by an agreement not to raise its
30 per cent stake. Even if it has tired of its poorly performing
investment, a suitor could pick up Kwik-Save at anything between 700p
and 800p.

Vosper Thornycroft (824p) The Southampton-based warship builder could
provide a tasty morsel for high- flying British Aerospace. BAe was
thwarted in its attempt to buy VSEL, and could be looking for another
catch to take it further into naval contracting. Vosper provides the
only challenge in this arena since VSEL and Yarrow are both part of
GEC. Although BAe is no longer desperate for cash, Vosper had a healthy
pounds 109m surplus at the last count. The shipbuilder also has a
healthy order book and is winning work away from shipbuilding too.

British Gas (256p) The shares plumbed new lows in 1995 as the market
digested the implications of its fixed-price take-or-pay contract
liabilities and fears over the new pricing regime for TransCo, the gas
transportation arm. Rumours of a predator surfaced late last year. At
pounds 11bn British Gas would be a mouthful for anyone. But TransCo
could be worth pounds 18bn, there is a valuable exploration division
and the company remains in a very strong position in the UK gas market.
Management would also have a hard job to defend its recent performance.

Crest Packaging (64p) It is increasingly difficult for smaller
packaging companies to compete. Without sufficient buying power and
economies of scale they need to grow significantly or be swallowed up.
Parkside and Ferry Pickering have already gone, and little Crest could
be next. It makes flexible packaging and cartons for consumer markets
and discussed a merger with Parkside last year. It has found it
difficult to pass on input price increases, and trading conditions
'remain tough'. Managing director Rodney Webb owns two-thirds of the
shares, so a buyer would need his consent.

Allied Domecq (537p) Vultures have reportedly been circling over Allied
for some time. Major restructuring and a number of changes in direction
have not produced significantly better performance either for the
business or the shares. Unless that changes soon, a buyer which fancies
its chances of running Allied's portfolio of spirit brands, pubs and
brewing activities could be hard to resist. Sir Christopher Hogg takes
over as chairman in April. He has to put some zip into Allied quickly
or it may be a short term of office.

NEWS: AMSTRAD - RESIGNATION HITS SHARES

Amstrad shares crashed almost 13 per cent in the quiet trading period
between Christmas and New Year as the consumer and business electronics
group belatedly revealed that its chief executive had quit. David
Rogers had served just 16 months of his three-year contract, which paid
him a salary of pounds 225,000.

The departure fuelled fears that Amstrad founder and chairman Alan
Sugar was once more taking hands-on control. Analysts also believe Mr
Sugar's thwarted plan of three years ago to take the company private
may be revived.

The City has never been convinced of Mr Sugar's commitment to serving
the interests of all Amstrad shareholders. 'No doubt he would be
happier if he was running Amstrad and owned it himself,' an analyst
commented. Mr Sugar's buy-back offer was worth the equivalent of 150p a
share. Now at 192p, the shares are worth 28 per cent more than Mr Sugar
offered - about the rate of growth achieved by the London market as a
whole. Mr Sugar's attempt to take Amstrad private ran aground because
shareholders felt their chairman was trying to get the company on the
cheap.

Mr Rogers was Amstrad's first chief executive. His decision to go
follows a crisis board meeting last month at which directors decided to
scale down Ace, the its ailing consumer electronics business, in order
'to reduce its cost base in line with its sales potential'. Ace brings
in about a fifth of Amstrad's turnover but has incurred losses for the
past three years. However since Mr Rogers joined Amstrad, Ace had been
brought to within a whisker of breaking even. Whether it could do
better than that is debatable given the intense competition in the
audio, video and satellite TV markets.

Almost a year ago, Mr Rogers told Investors Chronicle he would quit
Amstrad if he didn't get his way in the restructuring of the company -
but made it clear that he couldn't foresee such a situation arising.
'Alan Sugar is no different from any other entrepreneur,' said Mr
Rogers. 'All need great business acumen to get where they have. But
when it comes to running a business on a day-to-day basis all
entrepreneurs need help.'

NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BLOW TO BID HOPES

Takeover bids for water companies could be stopped in their tracks if
regulator Ian Byatt succeeds in preventing full mergers between buyers
and their water subsidiaries. Mr Byatt is conducting a campaign to
ensure that future buyers of companies under his supervision retain a
separate stock market listing for the water business. The prospect
could put would-be predators off, analysts said this week.

A separate listing would involve making at least 25 per cent of water
shares available for trading. The water arm would have to maintain an
independent board, diluting the control of the acquiring company over
matters such as dividends paid.

Corporate activity in the water industry has been relatively meagre in
comparison to the frenzied electricity sector, with just Northumbrian
Water losing its independence (to French utility Lyonnaise des Eaux).
While this combined group has informally agreed to retain a separate
quotation for the UK water utility, North West Water and Welsh Water,
which are taking over electricity companies, have so far resisted
pressure to follow suit.

Mr Byatt maintains that separate share price information is needed to
provide the regulator with an adequate basis for performance
comparisons. Some analysts find Ofwat's stance baffling, however. 'To
try and change the rules halfway through the game is ludicrous and
raises questions about Ian Byatt's credibility,' said one of them.

Companies which buy water distributors but resist separate listings
could face changes in their licence, said Ofwat. Failure to agree would
mean a referral to the monopolies commission - a prospect which is
often enough to derail takeover bids.

NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BURST PIPES BRING MORE BUSINESS

Ofwat this week called on water companies to explain why the loss of
water supplies to some weather-affected parts of the UK had lasted so
long. So far, though, the cost to water companies of the spate of burst
pipes looks likely to be slight. And the problem is even bringing extra
business to the hard-pressed building supplies sector. 'It's a nice
short-term boost but the overall impact is marginal,' said Steve

NEWS: SCHRODERS - MANAGER QUITS

Shares in the pounds 104m Schroder Japan Growth investment trust fell
by almost 5 per cent this week as fund manager Ed Merner announced his
resignation from Schroders for 'personal reasons'. A Schroders
spokeswoman denied there would be much effect on its funds, but Charles
Cade, an investment trust analyst at Merrill Lynch, warned: 'Ed Merner
is a big name and that supported the rating of the trust.' Mr Merner
also managed Schroders' pounds 229m Japanese Smaller Companies unit
trust.

The Japan Growth trust has performed well since its launch in July
1994. In the year to 1 November 1995 it was second-best of 12 funds in
the sector according to Micropal. The Smaller Companies unit trust has
been less successful, its performance in the five years to November
earning it 56th place among 73 funds.

Schroders appointed Andrew Rose, an institutional fund manager, to run
the unit trust and Jonathan Bolton, who currently manages another
Japanese unit trust, to run the Japan Growth Fund.

NEWS: FINANCE BILL - WRECKING CREW

Labour will attempt to derail the government's reforms of executive
share options and taxation as it tries to capitalise on John Major's
dwindling majority and amend the Finance Bill.

Labour believes the bill could be the key to its campaign to undermine
the government, which has a majority of five after the defection of
Devon MP Emma Nicholson to the Liberal Democrats.

Chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced in November's Budget speech that
profits on share options worth up to pounds 20,000 and granted to
employees since 17 July 1995 would be subject to capital gains tax
rather than income tax. The chancellor also said that share options
granted under a scheme approved by the taxman would escape income tax.
A spokeswoman for Andrew Smith, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,
said the government was watering down its support for recommendations
made in the Greenbury Report.

Labour will also use Finance Bill debates to try to delay the
introduction of the new system of self-assessment for tax. The new
system, due to begin in April, will cost business and the self-employed
an extra pounds 850m in the 1998-99 tax year, Labour claims.

IF Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's forecast of 3 per cent growth in GDP
comes through in 1996 something nice should happen to profits from
Airtours, the UK's second-biggest holiday operator after Thomson
Travel. Profits could recover strongly anyway from the level of 1994-95
when Airtours had its first profits fall since getting its listing in
1987.

The key will be how well Airtours manages to protect its profit
margins. The nature of the package-tour business is that too often it
is just too easy for operators to sacrifice margins in the pursuit of
extra volumes. When demand then fails to materialise - as was the case
in the UK last year - profits fall out of bed as they are still faced
with the sticky overheads of chartered air seats and booked hotel
rooms. The imperative of covering those overheads can turn into an
unseemly scramble and wipe out profits. Indeed, ABN Amro Hoare Govett,
stockbroker to Airtours, estimates that its profits per holidaymaker
from UK tour operating alone - stripping out the contribution from
Airtours' in-house airline - dropped from pounds 13 in 1991 to pounds 7
in 1994 and a loss last year.

However, just as operational gearing can take away, so it can also
give. On Hoare Govett's sensitivity analysis, pre-interest profits from
UK tour operating can swing from zero to pounds 37m depending in
particular on demand in the crucial holiday decision time in May and
June.

With this in mind, operators have cut capacity for the coming summer;
total market capacity is probably down by about 14 per cent.
Additionally, prices in the Airtours catalogues are up 8-10 per cent.
The first test will come this month, as January is the biggest booking
period of the year (though not the most important). A dull response
could mean that Airtours and others will go for a combination of
further capacity cuts plus some discounting. Such a scenario would not
be disastrous, but would result in the sort of outcome forecast in the
table opposite. A more optimistic view of demand would imply pre-tax
profits of pounds 75m or more.

Besides, Airtours has other things going for it: airlines and hotels
operations which, so long as they confine themselves to serving the
tour-operating side, keep extra profit in-house; a travel agency that
is to some extent contracyclical and an excellent Scandinavian tour
operator, which in its first full year as part of the Airtours group
contributed pounds 25m pre-tax against an pounds 80m acquisition cost.

As to how to play the opportunity, Airtours has an inviting convertible
which yields 7.1 per cent and trades at a mere 4 per cent premium to
the ordinary. It has marginally less gearing (pounds 1 of convertible
buys 96p of equity), but the income difference must mean it is the one
for income seekers. That said, either stock is worth buying.

RADIO advertising revenues continue to grow rapidly. Even if the pace
slows, radio will still grow faster than other advertising media. The
Advertising Association recently downgraded its forecast for total
advertising growth for 1996 from 11 to 8 per cent, but kept its
prediction for radio advertising at 17 per cent; that compares with an
estimated 25 per cent rise in 1995. One of the beneficiaries will be
Capital Radio. It is cash-rich and in a good position to grow. There is
also the added spice that relaxation of cross-media ownership rules
could make it a bid target.

At the start of the 1990s radio's share of display advertising was
under 3 per cent. It is now well on the way to achieving 6 per cent by
the end of the decade. Part of this growth has come from the launch of
national radio stations, but much is due to existing stations selling
the advantages of radio advertising. London has become particularly
competitive in recent years with new stations starting up. While
Capital has inevitably lost market share, it continues to dominate. In
the third quarter of 1995 38 per cent of radio listeners tuned in to
Capital Gold on AM or Capital FM each week. As the market leader,
advertisers still make a beeline for it. Last year, underlying revenues
for all the company's radio stations grew by 21 per cent. This was
partly due to better performances from its Midlands and Southern
stations.

Capital only has around 10 per cent of the available percentage points
used to guage market share in the industry. It can hold up to 15 per
cent, so there is plenty of scope for expansion with cash in the
coffers to finance it. It is looking at new regional licences that are
coming up for grabs.

Under proposed media ownership rules, any media company with less than
20 per cent of its own market can buy itself up to 15 per cent of
another sector. That makes Capital an ideal target for an acquisitive
company operating in another branch of the media.

Stockbroker Merrill Lynch calculates that every extra 1 per cent on
revenues is worth around pounds 370,000 in extra profit. Buy for
continued growth plus the takeover possibilities.

DE LA RUE has few friends. Two profits warnings last year led to a
slump in its shares and their subsequent demotion from the FT-SE 100
index. It is time to reassess prospects. De La Rue's ability to
generate cash and its strong market positions are not doubted while
National Lottery organiser Camelot is starting to make a contribution
to profits.

Acquiring paper maker Portals a year ago looked like management taking
its eye off the ball. Yet Portals already contributes strongly to
profits and peripheral activities, such as making tea bags, have been
sold.

The banknote market is growing at 4 per cent per annum. Taking a longer-
term perspective, the integration of banknote printing and paper-making
should help De La Rue gain business through improved anti-
counterfeiting technology. The current order book has improved although
this is at lower margins.

Payment and transaction systems were supposed to take up the running
from banknotes, but they have had problems. Garny is having to cope
with stiff competition in Germany and US bank mergers hit demand for
cash machines. The trend towards increasing automation of banking is
unchanged, though. Therefore demand for the company's cash-handling
equipment should continue to grow for the foreseeable future.

Management needs to convince cynical investors that it won't slip up
again. This will take time, but we expect it to achieve this by the end
of the year. Buy.

HOW will Greenalls exploit its augmented buying power in 1996?
Skilfully, suggests the management's record. The pounds 527m purchase
of Boddington in October adds 454 outlets to the pub estate, bringing
it to 2,300, of which 1,100 are managed in-house. Though this is only 4
per cent of the UK total, the group's pubs are much higher volume than
average. Given the 20 per cent overcapacity in UK brewing, Greenalls'
enhanced position as the largest chain among the independents (those
not owned by brewers) means it is better placed than ever to buy beer
cheaply.

Greenalls' main supplier is Carlsberg/Tetley, Boddington's is
Whitbread. There are long-term supply agreements in place, till 1998
with Carlsberg/Tetley, and till 2000 with Whitbread. There is, however,
plenty of room to vary contract terms which cover only part of the
retailer's needs. Assuming it can push Whitbread product through former
Boddington pubs, and do likewise with Carlsberg/Tetley brands in
Boddington outlets, the group is in a strong position to buy cheaper
liquid, especially as the brewers always face the temptation to sell
extra volume at a very low price to get that last drop of profit.

Greenalls' finance director, Alan Rothwell, points out that the group
does virtually no business with Scottish Courage, adding that the
regional brewers are a loose cannon in capacity terms. The fact that
brewers need to renew their contracts well ahead of expiry date gives a
retailer, like Greenalls, scope to secure good buying terms for the
present as well. Boddington was bought for 21.5 times its 1994
earnings, which is why the forecast numbers in the table below are so
tame. But the beer supply/demand picture suggest that growth will
rapidly become apparent.

Elsewhere, the hotels division continues to grow nicely. The off-
licence and wholesaling businesses fit with pubs, the 500 off-licences
giving the group buying power in spirits and wines, while the pubs give
the off-licences leverage in beer. Tavern, the wholesale operation
being combined with Boddington's Liquid Assets, also benefits from the
group's extra buying power. Though not as big as Matthew Clarke,
wholesaling could be better positioned as far as price is concerned.

The stock, No. 104 by stock market capitalisation, is tapping at the
door of the FT-SE 100 club. If Greenalls gets in, index-tracking funds
should give it a further lift. Meanwhile, Greenalls grows on many
fronts. Buy.

IT IS all coming together for Wescol, the Halifax-based structural
steelmaker. One of only two quoted structural steelmakers to survive
the last recession, Wescol is making the most of a strong market. It
has improved efficiency and will benefit from the growing success of
its patented cellular steel beam.

Demand for structural steelwork - used in football grounds and large
buildings such as factories and shopping centres - is expected to grow
almost 5 per cent in 1996. The growth in sales now follows a near-
catastrophic collapse in the market after a 1989 sales peak of 1.4m
tonnes. About 250 fabricators vanished from the industry. Wescol is one
of seven key survivors. The rest include the other quoted structural
steel company, Severfield-Reeve, the privately owned William Hare and
subsidiaries of Rugby and Amec.

Structural steelwork has escaped the worst of the problems affecting
the rest of the construction industry and prospects look good for the
next 18 months. Wescol is also working hard to build exports, which
should buffer the company from any collapse in UK demand. Exports
should chip in 15 per cent of sales in 1995-96. A joint venture with a
Singapore contractor gives Wescol a way into Asian-Pacific construction
contracts, particularly in China, and Wescol is considering further
joint ventures of this type.

In the UK the company has just quadrupled the space available in its
Halifax factory. However, Wescol will continue to sub-contract some of
its work. Sub-contracted work earns a lower margin, but it also
transfers some of the risk from the repeated delays common in
construction contracts.

Westok, the group's cellular beam maker, is 'going like a train' the
company says. Wescol invented the cellular beam - a steel beam with
holes that offers increased strength without increased weight. For now
Westok remains a relatively small part of the business, 8 per cent of
turnover, but the cellular beam is growing in popularity with engineers
and architects.

Marbank, the last bit of the group, is a niche contractor specialising
in work worth about pounds 500,000. It is doing well, against the
contracting trend in the UK, but is not a key part of the group.

Wescol had a gruelling time in the early 1990s. Its mistakes on bad
debts and rampaging gearing mean it has taken longer to recover than
Severfield-Reeve and the Yorkshire rival still tends to overshadow
Wescol's potential. But it has learnt its lesson and 1996 should be the
year Wescol proves its point. Buy the shares.

BETWEEN May 1993 and December 1995, Conrad Ritblat's net assets grew
from pounds 1m to pounds 34m. Chaired by property guru John Ritblat,
the company has in recent months paid Allied Domecq pounds 10.6m for
109 pubs that are let to Burtonwood Brewery, bought a portfolio of nine
properties from the Royal Bank of Scotland for pounds 9.9m and more
than doubled the size of its property consultancy operation with the
pounds 400,000 acquisition of rival Colliers Erdman Lewis (CEL).

Conrad Ritblat is a hybrid in the property sector in that its
activities include chartered surveying as well as property ownership
and rental. Not well understood, its shares fail to discount prospects
for rising profits in conjunction with asset growth.

Executive director Philip Lewis describes the CEL acquisition as a
'real coup'. Conrad Ritblat has managed CEL since a receiver was
appointed in October. Since then, it has downsized operations by
shedding staff and closing or rationalising regional offices. At a
budgeted pounds 12m, CEL's fee income will be sharply down in 1995. It
peaked at pounds 25m. But even at the reduced level, it will double the
turnover of Conrad Ritblat's estate agency business.

Having expanded this side of its operations, the company hopes to
funnel more business through it. It initiated both the Allied Domecq
and Royal Bank of Scotland deals and they were structured so that
Conrad Ritblat has been promised more of these companies' traditional
property consultancy work. As well as pounds 5.5m cash, Royal Bank of
Scotland received 16m Conrad Ritblat shares in exchange for its
properties. They were issued at 27.5p against a then market price of
23p. It will own 11.8 per cent of the enlarged equity.

Conrad Ritblat's existing properties in the City and West End are both
pretty much fully let. About 15,000 square feet of its premises at 9
Marylebone Lane are let to M&C Saatchi, the Saatchi brothers' new
advertising agency. It also owns properties in Glasgow and Leeds.

Ahead of February's interims, no forecasts were available for 1995-96.
In any event, the full impact of recent deals won't be felt until 1996-
97 when profits of between pounds 3m and pounds 4m are possible. Conrad
Ritblat looks a strong growth story; buy.

ELECTRONICS giant GEC's managing director Lord Weinstock, 72 in the
summer, is retiring this year, which should add some spice to the share
price. The shares will soar if a high-calibre recruit, preferably from
outside, is appointed to fill the void. GEC has some superb, if
underperforming assets. Its cash mountain, even after splashing out
pounds 800m on submarine builder VSEL last year, totals over pounds
1bn. Another pounds 1.3bn cash is in joint ventures. Some of this could
- and arguably should - be handed back to shareholders.

Trading-wise GEC is not in bad shape either. Its order book stands at a
record pounds 13.7bn while profits are expected to lift off a six-year
plateau this year. Marconi, its defence and aerospace electronics arm,
is going into the production phase on a number of key projects. Cost
overrun problems of the past seem to be resolved. Recovery prospects
from aerospace look good. Defence faces the challenge of slimmer
government budgets. But a major joint venture followed by restructuring
could bring beneficial effects. Its telecommunications and power
systems arms are already within joint ventures. Review of GEC's fourth
leg - a mixed bag of industrial operations - is long overdue.

The appointment of a worthy successor to Lord Weinstock could make a
big difference to sentiment. Buy ahead of the announcement.

Cairn's share price this year will be made or broken by what happens in
bangladesh. cairn has 100 per cent interests in two potentially
enormous gas fields there. drilling started in december and if the
results are good, industry analysts estimate the upside in cairn's
asset value at 100p per share plus.

Cairn's recent record suggests it has a better-than-even chance of
unlocking that potential. Since 1992 the company has transformed
itself, helped by its US subsidiary, CEUSA, hitting a massive gas field
in the Gulf of Mexico. CEUSA has since been sold for about pounds 32m
and the money used to build a portfolio of cash-generating assets in
the UK and Netherlands. These will fund the development in Bangladesh,
and other blue sky prospects in Thailand, Vietnam and China.

Ignoring anything that may happen in Bangladesh, house broker Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull estimates that Cairn's net assets are worth
95p per share anyway. Results of the first Bangladeshi well, offshore
on Block 16, are expected at the end of this month. The most optimistic
brokers' estimates suggest there is 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas in
both of Cairn's prospects. That could be worth up to pounds 160m or
pounds 2 per share to Cairn. Therefore there is the potential that
realisable net assets of almost pounds 3 will play a share price of
115p. By any criteria of buying assets for less than their face value,
that makes for an attractive prospect.

Admittedly the risks are big, too. Cairn has first to find the gas and
establish that it's feasible to extract it economically; then it must
negotiate a deal to build a power station to burn it and agree terms
with the government. But if the drilling news is good, the share price
will reflect the possibilities well in advance. The shares are a gamble
but also a buy.

PILKINGTON has been transformed from a sleepy family-run business prone
to strategic blunders to a fast-growing global glass maker. It has
untangled itself from its disastrous foray into contact lenses,
stripped out pounds 200m of overheads and expanded into developing
markets.

In the short term, recovery in the mature European and US glass markets
will power profits. Volumes should rise by 3 per cent next year and
prices have begun to harden. With its cost-cutting programme in full
swing, margins could increase from 8 per cent to 10 per cent over the
next two years.

Acquisitions will also fuel growth. The proceeds of a recent pounds
303m rights issue has been put to good use. Pilkington paid pounds 120m
to buy the remaining 50 per cent of Italian car glass manufacturer SIV.
The pounds 55m purchase of glass merchants Interpane also gives it a
foothold in the Swiss and Scandinavian markets.

Glass making remains a cyclical business and demand will peak by 1998.
But Pilkington's rapid expansion abroad leaves it well placed to ride
out any downturn. Developing countries currently account for a third of
profits, but earnings should rocket over the next few years. South
America is the fastest-growing market in the world and Pilks is already
the leading glass maker in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. There is also
huge potential in China and to build on its presence in Eastern Europe
from its stronghold in Poland.

Pilkington's resurgence is being helped by a range of new high-margin
products. Sales of insulating K-glass have soared and EZ-Kool, which
reflects infra-red rays, has proved popular with motor manufacturers.
Stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull forecasts that recovery
will push Pilkington's profits to pounds 310m in 1997, meaning that the
shares are only 10 times that year's expected earnings. Buy.

ABACUS is making all the right moves in the booming electronic
components market. Demand for non-computer electronics should increase
by at least 12 per cent in 1996. Although this is a slight slowdown on
last year, with UK inflation at under 3 per cent electrocomponents
remains one of industry's fastest-growing markets.

On past performance, Abacus is odds-on to outstrip that growth. Over
the last few years the group has been steadily winning market share.
Abacus aims to forge links with customers via regional sales offices
which look after just a handful of accounts. Abacus is the only large
distributor that sources components from both franchised manufacturers -
 Abacus has 34, including household names Siemens, Toshiba and
Panasonic - and overseas. This gives it an enviable spread of products
and the flexibility to offer dedicated stocks and just-in-time
supplies. In a market where customers are cutting back their number of
suppliers, Abacus's focus on service is spot-on.

November's pounds 36m acquisition of Polar looks a good fit. The two
have only one franchised supplier and just 10 per cent of their top 300
customers in common. Polar brings another 26 franchised suppliers and
doubles the number of customers to over 4,000, establishing Abacus as
the UK's fifth-largest distributor. With scope to increase
productivity, Abacus is looking to push Polar's 7 per cent margins
closer to its own 12 per cent in the UK. And Polar's technical strength
in component design adds a new element to Abacus's portfolio.

With minimal borrowings, even after Polar, expansion in Europe is next.
Last year's Scandinavian acquisition, Promax, is performing excellently
and Abacus has just opened an office in the key German market.

The share rating does not reflect Abacus-cum-Polar's strong UK market
position nor the benefits of expansion abroad. Buy.

MARKET STRATEGY: NOT A TIME TO JUNK THE LESSONS OF HISTORY

At year-end 1994, with the FT-SE 100 limping along near 3000, most
forecasters were quite restrained in their expectations for the year
ahead. This was despite the fact that a number of historical trends,
some running for most of this century, flagged a rise to 3700
(accurately, as it turned out) over the next 12 months.

Many of the same long-term trends are now warning of possible
disappointment to UK equity investors in 1996. Here are three worth
watching.

The dividend yield of the FT-SE-A All-Share index currently stands
below 4 per cent. From a historical perspective, this is quite ominous.

Since the All-Share was initiated in 1962, the dividend yield has ended
the year below 4 per cent on just five occasions. On four of these
occasions, share prices fell in the following year. The usual pattern
was for the bottom to be reached in mid-year, followed by a mild
recovery.

The year-end 1971 signal was a short-lived exception. Prices rose by 17
per cent in the next few months, despite the historical experience. But
the April peak turned out to be the start of the UK's worst-ever bear
market. Although shares held on to some of these profits at yearend,
the down-trend continued for two more years, ultimately dropping prices
by a mind-numbing 69 per cent.

Another important signal is provided by the cyclical indicators,
published each month by the Central Statistical Office to help
interested organisations and individuals to monitor the state of the UK
economy. Although the indices were not designed for this purpose, they
make an excellent tool for forecasting stock market ebbs and flows.

Two cyclical indices worth monitoring are the Shorter Leading Index,
which flags turning points in the economy six months ahead of time, and
the Coincident Index, designed to rise and fall in lock step with
actual economic growth.

Since 1959, when the series was first published, a late-in-the-cycle
rise on the Shorter Leading Index above the preceding month's score and
a reading above average on the Coincident Index has consistently been
associated with bull market peaks.

The signal sometimes flashes very early, as much as one year in
advance, so we can only use it as a rough timing guide even though it
is a powerful bear market signal. At present the message from the
cyclical indicators is quite clear. This stock market upturn will end
no later than April 1996.

The third signal - the most important of all - is the length of time
this rally has run. After a sharp price drop in the first half of 1994,
prices bottomed out in June and have been rising ever since, six
quarters in a row.

No-one knows when this upturn will end, but continuous rises for more
than four quarters are very rare. There have been just 12 in the UK
this century. No recent upward move has run longer than seven quarters
in a row. Using history as a guide, the odds are very low that the
current upturn will continue for much longer.

What will happen once the upturn ends? Here, too, history provides a
valuable clue. After continuous quarterly upward moves run their
course, shares usually decline, often for just three to six months,
followed by a recovery that lifts prices back towards the starting
point. When the smoke clears, generally nine to 12 months after the
uptrend is first broken, prices are, at best, close to their starting
point.

Putting it all together, history suggests a disappointing 1996 with the
path to the year-end more like a roller-coaster ride than a stroll
along a sleepy country lane. When the smoke clears 12 months from now,
look for a FT-SE 100 at around the 3700 level.

In the US, 1996 is a presidential election year. Politically, then, it
is a time of great excitement and uncertainty. But the stock market
will take no notice of this, following the same old patterns that have
applied in the past.

Since 1928, there have been 12 presidential election years that were
preceded with a share price increase of at least 10 per cent the year
before. 1995 is number 13 in the series. Wall Street rose each and
every time in the election year that followed. The average election
year price increase was 16 per cent, suggesting a rise to near 6000 on
the Dow Jones by December 1996.

The Tokyo stock market has been in free fall since 1990. History
provides two precedents for a stock market decline of such magnitude
and duration: the 86 per cent smash on Wall Street in 1929-32 and the
69 per cent London fall in 1972-74. Both recoveries began with very
sharp price increases, 38 per cent in each of two successive months in
New York, and a 51 per cent single month rise in London.

Tokyo is not following the norm despite the fact that it is a much more
volatile stock market than London or New York. So far, the recovery
from its mid-year low has been comparatively mild (the Nikkei 225 is up
by 37 per cent from the early July low). This raises the suspicion that
the bottom may not yet been reached.

For 1996, there are two possible scenarios for Tokyo. The market will
either continue to drift up as it has done in the second half of 1995,
or drop sharply in a bloody finale to the bear market that has consumed
most of the 1990s.

If it does drop sharply, the recovery will be equally breathtaking.
Either way, I forecast that the Nikkei will rest near 22,000 at year-
end 1996.

MARKET STRATEGY: JAPAN - WAITING ON THE LOCALS

THE Japanese stock market ended the year with a flourish. After briefly
hitting the 20,000 level for the first time in 14 months, the Nikkei
225 index finally finished at 19,868.

Although this was less than 1 per cent higher than the previous
December's close, it nonetheless represented a remarkable 37 per cent
gain on the year's low of 14,485 recorded in early July, when fears of
a re-run of the panic which prevailed in the summer of 1992 were at
their height.

Key factors in the second half's optimism included a sustained fall in
the yen against the dollar, a continued decline in short- and long-term
interest rates, further recovery in corporate earnings, and yet greater
fiscal stimulation by the government (the recently published draft
budget for 1996-97 does, moreover, propose the sharpest rise in public
spending for five years).

To add icing to the cake, worries about a banking crisis have receded
because of the government's involvement in the rescue package for
stricken housing loan companies.

Despite increasing confidence that, this time, Japan's economic
recovery will prove to be for real, it is nonethless striking that
domestic institutions continue to remain firmly on the stock market
sidelines. In 1995, as in 1994, locals were heavy sellers of equities.
If the market's latest rally is not to fizzle out, domestic
institutions will soon need to pick up the buying baton from
foreigners.

MARKET STRATEGY: THE BURSTING OF THE ASIAN BUBBLE

Having lost pounds 800,000 on his holdings of Thai stocks, Vivat
Srisammacheep walked onto the floor of the Bangkok Stock Exchange in
November and shot himself in the chin. His consternation, if not his
aiming, was understandable. Usually, when US stocks rise, Thai stocks
rise by more. Not in 1995, however. That was the first year since 1980
that the Thai market had fallen while the US had risen.

As goes Thailand, so go south east Asian equities generally. Their
falls last year mean that they are now back to the lows of 1992-93 when
compared with US stocks.

So why did these markets become decoupled from the US? The principal
reason lies in the fears of 'overheating' that struck the region. Rapid
economic growth has caused rising inflation (although in Malaysia and
Thailand this has been held down by stiffer price controls) and huge
trade deficits. Ng Bok Eng of Morgan Grenfell foresees the Malaysian
deficit rising to 9.3 per cent of GDP, and the Thai gap rising to 7.5
per cent. These are huge numbers; when the UK had its last balance of
payments crisis in 1989, the deficit was a mere 4.3 per cent of GDP. To
curb this overheating, interest rates have risen.

In itself, this need not have had disastrous effects upon the markets.
After all, the trade deficits were largely the result of purchases of
capital goods by Japanese companies which had set up in the area, so
the borrowing from overseas would be expected to pay for itself in due
course. And anyway, Malaysian stocks rose in 1991, when interest rates
rose by more than they did this year, as did Indonesian stocks in 1990.

Unfortunately, after the collapse of the Mexican peso last December,
overseas investors became particularly jumpy about trade imbalances.
Hence they sold the Indonesian, Thai and Malaysian markets even though
their deficits were no worse this year than in 1990 or 1991.

Once this selling had depressed the markets, other problems exacerbated
the decline. In Thailand, private investors like the hapless Mr
Srisammacheep, who had bought with borrowed money, were forced to sell
stock to meet margin payments. In Indonesia, investors feared that
looming privatisations would depress prices - fears which were borne
out by the unsuccessful sell-off of Tambang Timah. And in Malaysia the
circulation of forged share certificates and the drop in the price of
palm oil hit stocks.

With these markets now at two- or three-year lows relative to the US,
isn't it time to buy? Maybe not. Most expect further rises in interest
rates, and warn that the huge trade gaps may weaken the currencies.
Equally worrying, if not more so, last year's decoupling from Wall
Street may not be a permanent structural change. It could be the result
of temporary factors, such as the aftermath of the Mexican crisis and
overheating in the region. If so, then these markets would be
vulnerable to any weakness on Wall Street. Traditionally, when it has
sneezed, Asian markets have caught colds; in the two months after the
1987 crash, when US stocks fell 20 per cent, the Thai and Malaysian
markets halved.

Nevertheless, some predict good returns later in 1996. Alan Butler-
Henderson at Barings believes that overheating problems will fade next
year as capital spending slows down (particularly in Malaysia) whilst
growth outside the region picks up. Once this happens, he says,
'markets in South East Asia should enjoy a much better year' and we
should 'be prepared for an impressive run' in Malaysian stocks in the
second half of 1996. By the spring, the region's markets may appear a
lot more attractive than Mr Srisammacheep.

MARKET STRATEGY: UK SECTORS - PLACE YOUR BETS

Polarisation was the name of the sector game in 1995. At one extreme
were the beneficiaries of the favoured themes of international growth,
interest-rate sensitivity, and corporate activity. Pharmaceuticals and
financials (life assurance, banks and to a lesser extent insurance)
found themselves dominating the sector league table because they could
satisfy not merely one, but two, of these thematic requirements.

At the other extreme were the victims of the dread 'cyclicality'. The
worst-performing sector, gas distribution, was admittedly an exception
to this rule and owed its dunce's cap to the specific problems of
British Gas. Elsewhere amongst the laggards, however, so-called
'cyclicals' such as paper, packaging and printing, textiles, building
materials and the catch-all diversified industrials proved unable to
resist the mounting pressure of profit downgrades stemming from the low-
growth, low-inflation environment.

In the middle ground, with performances grouped around the All-Share's
19 per cent rise over the 12 months, tended to be the more defensive
consumer/services areas.

According to Goldman Sachs, the expected weakness in the UK economy in
the first half of 1996 means that investors should continue to follow
the sectoral lead already given - in a similar low-growth situation -
by the US.

On Wall Street, sector outperformance has been determined by what
Goldman describes as the holy trinity of technology, financial services
and growth. On its reading of US equities, these should still determine
outperformance in the UK. Banks, insurances, growth stocks in media and
drugs, and the smaller tech stocks are consequently on their buying
list, together with bid stocks.

Cyclicals, especially those which are price 'takers' as opposed to
price determiners (chemicals, packaging, components) are forecast to
remain out of favour.

In contrast, BZW believes it is time to look for opportunities within
the cyclicals, rather than dwell on past disappointments, because GDP
and earnings growth should be recovering in 1996, especially during the
second half as consumer spending becomes the major driving force.

After juggling with the three elements of inventories and costs (which
determine the margin outlook), and geographic exposure (the likely
source of volume growth) BZW selects building materials, diversified
industrials, and electronics as its top three industrial picks. For
exposure to the domestic consumer theme, general retailers, leisure and
wines/spirits are identified, at the expense of more defensive areas of
spending such as food retailing, food manufacturing or brewing.

Although 'international growth', epitomised by media and
pharmaceuticals stocks, should not be ignored, says BZW, they could
take a temporary back seat in favour of cheaper growth alternatives.
The hitherto high-performing banks sector is viewed with concern, on
the grounds that the banks are vulnerable to rising real interest
rates.

MARKET STRATEGY: WALL STREET - ADDING VALUE?

Most US-market watchers agree that in 1996 there will be low inflation
and modest growth. But if the value of goods and services produced
grows only slowly, how can the value of the companies making them rise
quickly? There are several reasons, all of which have combined in the
1990s to send equity prices rising far above money GDP. The share of
output going to profits has risen, thanks to strong productivity growth
and low wage growth. Lower bond yields and greater economic stability
mean these higher profits are discounted less heavily. And recently,
merger activity has - it is hoped - raised the efficiency with which
growth is delivered.

But it is doubtful whether these forces can persist. Stephen S Roach at
Morgan Stanley warns that, with unemployment now low, 'the days of
asking labour to keep sacrificing appear to be largely over'. A 'worker
backlash' would either squeeze profits or raise inflation, and hence
bond yields. Mr Roach expects the latter. 'Everything good is just
about priced into the market,' he says. 'As inflation fails to conform
to consensus prognostications, the next big move in yields is back
towards 7 per cent.'

But Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber says corporate restructuring is far
from complete. A theme of 1996, he says, will be 'disaggregation', as
peripheral businesses are sold off. 'Such deals,' he says, 'are often a
win-win proposition for shareholders. Spun-off businesses tend to
outperform the market and many companies initiating disaggregation also
tend to be strong performers; recent examples include AT&T and ITT.'

Unfortunately, if Mr Kerschner is right, the winners will be specific
stocks, whilst if Mr Roach is right, the losers will be the entire
market. Investors' best hope lies in the low inflation, low interest
rate consensus proving correct - even if this destroys earnings growth.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: UK STRATEGY - THEMES FOR '96

The accepted orthodoxies of the Christmas season can all too soon
become the Aunt Sallies of the new year, according to BZW. This is a
particular risk at present, given how hard the stock market is buying
the low-growth, low-interest-rate argument.

With very much a 12-month view in mind, BZW chooses instead to stress
the following themes.

First, the 'pause' interpretation of the economy seems most tenable.
Growth is expected to recover sharply in the second half of the year,
led by consumers. Growth of 2.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent is expected
in 1996 and 1997, respectively. On this reading, base rate rises late
this year are on the cards.

Admittedly, there will be limited political appetite to raise rates
with a general election looming. However, BZW sees no benefit for the
financial markets if politics is clearly seen to prevail over
economics. Short-term interest rates may not rise, but in such
circumstances long-term rates surely would.

Moreover, the risks on the currency increase as the election gets
nearer. BZW anticipates a sterling/dollar rate of dollars 1.44 in 1996,
but a rally in the pound to DM2.30 when the US dollar strengthens.

As far as gilts are concerned, stronger nominal GDP growth is rarely
the friend of the market. Ten-year yields are forecast to move back to
8.25 per cent.

BZW's view of growth signals that the current weight of profit
downgrades may not be long-lasting. However, equities could remain
driven more by interest rates than earnings, with cash-financed
takeover activity less of a positive factor. A dull 1996 is
anticipated, with 3750 as the year-end FT-SE 100 forecast. Preferred
sectors are building materials, electronics and general retailers.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: GLOBAL STRATEGY - MORE DIFFICULT

For 1996, Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley thinks that the crucial asset
allocation is to be underweight in US equities, pondering the sale of
US bonds, and overweight in Asia.

Although 1996 is likely to be a less happy year than 1995, a
synchronised bear market is not anticipated. At this point cash is
unattractive because the indicators of the liquidity cycle continue to
be very favourable, central banks are easing and interest rates are
falling.

At the same time it is evident that economic growth in Europe, Japan
and North America is at best sluggish. In Europe, the sluggishness is
spreading from the D-Mark bloc to the weak-currency countries on
Europe's periphery. In Japan, the latest Tankan report was only
superficially encouraging. In the rest of Asia, high real interest
rates are slowing growth.

Meanwhile, inflation in the developed world is very low, and the loss
of pricing power is becoming a serious problem for many companies.
However, Mr Biggs doesn't buy the story that the world is on the brink
of a deflationary episode that would be bullish for high-grade bonds
but bearish for equities.

Sometime next year, probably in the second half, the big-locomotive
economies of the industrial world - the US, Japan, and Germany - will
begin to revive. This will be good news for politicians and working
people, but bad news for investors, who will begin worrying about a
pick-up in inflation and higher interest rates. The best guess is that
the recovery won't be sufficiently synchronised, and that while it may
cause a cyclical bear market in the US, there will only be a correction
in what will by then be bull markets in Japan, emerging Asia and the
other emerging markets.

The other risk is that the excess liquidity currently being created
causes a bubble in financial markets that pops at the first indication
of Fed tightening, as happened in late 1993. The mania over technology
stocks and the high degree of bond-buyer bullishness gives some basis
for this worry, as does the fact that valuations are filthy rich,
particularly in the US. Nonetheless, the individual bubbles can
probably be pricked without precipitating a global bear market.

As far as currencies are concerned, the dominant force will be yen
weakness, as the Bank of Japan prints paper and Japan's trade surplus
falls rapidly. The dollar will have an upward bias, as will many
countries in emerging Asia.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: SPAIN - STILL TIME TO BUY

Despite its recent outperformance relative to Europe (ex UK), Spain
will continue to outperform well into the first quarter of 1996,
according to Merrill Lynch.

The key factors are a continued rally in the bond market, falling
interest rates and the prospect of political change. Spanish earnings
momentum has been remarkably stable yet the stock market is still
trading at a 15 per cent discount to its historical average prospective
PE ratio of 13. As a result, the potential upside clearly outweighs any
downside risk.

The Spanish-German bond yield differential has narrowed sharply over
the past three months, and should narrow further. Although part of the
improvement in Spanish bonds has come from external factors, such as
the continuing strength of US bonds and the recent cut in German
interest rates, the rest will come domestically from the improving
inflation outlook and a reduced political risk premium.

Perhaps the biggest change in 1996 will be on the political front,
where early general elections are expected to be called for the second
half of March. The most recent poll shows the Partido Popular (PP) has
built up a 16-point lead over the Socialists. Although it will probably
be a minority government, the big issue is what policy changes the PP
would actually make and how far they would go in resolving Spain's
inflation, unemployment and budget-deficit problems. In reality it is
still too early to make an informed judgment.

While Spain would obviously be affected by a collapse in the US bond
markets and renewed concerns over European monetary union - or rather,
the lack of budgetary discipline that convergence criteria currently
provide - short-term performance will be most sensitive to the current
test case in France.

Nevertheless Merrill believes the market will run up between now and
the election, followed by a period of profit-taking.

After that, it depends on the market's belief in the political change
argument. One thing is certain: it won't be right to be neutral over
the longer term.

Tokyo-based Ed Merner has not had an easy time. The trust raised pounds
119m in July 1994 and immediately invested half that money - the trust
was 'in a hurry to get the money in' with much going into an overweight
position in smaller companies and banks. This made a deleterious impact
on asset value. The trust has recently geared up via a pounds 20m loan,
much of which has been invested in consumer-related and smaller company
shares. The trust has never hedged its currency exposure.

This Henderson-managed trust turned in a 'disappointing performance'
last year. partly because smaller Japanese companies underperformed but
also because, on the assumption that Japan was on the verge of
recovery, it hedged the currency and increased its gearing. But those
two factors could boost performance this year provided smaller company
shares start to perform: at end-July more than 90 per cent of the fund
was invested in companies with a market value below pounds 710m.

There's a new-look team managing the trust following Marc Gordon's

'almost frenzied corporate activity'. At end-September half the
portfolio was invested in FT-SE Mid 250 shares and the balance in

INVESTMENT SOFTWARE: A PACKAGE FOR LAID-BACK INVESTORS

INVESTORS are a varied bunch. From the bustle of the day trader to the
comparative inactivity of the long-term buy- and-hold strategist. The
last two reviews have examined sub-pounds 250 software packages
suitable for the investor who falls in the middle of this range. Both
programs (Windows on Wall Street and Metastock for Windows) assume that
the investor has access to daily data and a bias towards technical
analysis. Pricetrack, by contrast, is a small DOS-based program more
suited to the less active investor. Although certainly not as
sophisticated or visually attractive as the other two programs, the
software includes some practical features and includes a data service
in the price.

Although the program will run under a DOS extension from Windows,
installation takes place from the DOS prompt. The manual does, however,
recommend running the memory optimisation utility included with later
versions of DOS (Memmaker) before attempting to run Pricetrack. This is
because the software uses a lot of expanded memory and will run like a
snail if it is not available. In virtually every case, running Memmaker
and following the instructions provided will ensure smooth operation.
Pricetrack does offer mouse support, so you don't have to learn an
irritating selection of multiple keyboard commands in order to operate
it.

The program is structured around a set of Lotus spreadsheets and has
three main modules: the weekly share price system that allows database
manipulation and graphing; a reports section that collates fundamental
data on equities; and portfolio management. The largest module is the
weekly share price system which has four main menu sections (general,
sort, update and gain) and a separate set of charting commands. The
general menu allows switching into other menus and covers basic default
settings. Users can select whether they want keyboard or mouse control.
Pricetrack displays 'setpoint markers' on graphs that show year-ends.
These are quite obtrusive and can be disabled if required.

The gain menu uses the spreadsheet base of the program to best
advantage and allows ranking of shares according to a number of
criteria. The entire database (some 580 equities and indices) can be
sorted in order of gains made in the last one, four or 52 weeks,
obviously handy when checking the consistency of an equity's
performance. For those looking to balance a portfolio, it is also
possible to rank the equities within their individual FT sectors over
the same periods as well. The individual sectors are listed first in
the spreadsheet followed by the shares in each sector in performance
ranking for the period.

As with most sorting functions on a computer, the speed of this
operation will depend on your processor - on a 486DX66 it was virtually
instantaneous. The sort menu provides similar functions to the gain
menu but for different criteria. The entire database can be placed in
descending order for market capitalisation or dividend yield over the
last one, four or 52 weeks. The database can also be set in sector
order following the usual financial times groupings.

The update menu processes the data supplied by Pricetrack Ltd and adds
it to the database. As the full database is large, users can extract a
selection of equities for monitoring. This extract function is carried
out by marking shares in the main database with a number. Users can use
codes to classify equities. For example, shares already owned could be
marked with '2', those under consideration for purchase with '4' and so
on. When extracted, shares in each category will then be grouped
together.

The reports database module supplies fundamental equity data (where
available) for both the current and previous year. Data includes last
dividend payments, net profit, earnings per share, total dividend,
turnover and net asset value. There is a sort facility available, but
it is only available for alphabetical listing or date of last company
report. It would be helpful if this facility could be extended to some
of the other data fields. As the database is large, a 'find' utility is
included which will search for an equity based on the first few letters
of the name. This is something of a godsend.

The portfolio valuation system allows multiple portfolio files to be
created that can be updated from the weekly system disk or a manually
updated extract file. For professional advisers handling a large number
of portfolios, a separate price file can be created from the weekly
system that will dramatically speed up valuation or printing. A total
portfolio valuation is displayed at the top of the worksheet, while
next to each equity is a figure for individual gain in both cash and
percentage terms since purchase. Entries can also be made for dealing
costs and cash on deposit.

The charting facilities of Pricetrack are fairly basic, with a low
resolution graphic display, but still perfectly comprehensible.
Investors with a technical bias are unlikely to get very excited. The
software offers a certain amount of flexibility to the investor keen on
comparing a number of equities for relative performance. Equities can
also be plotted against the FT-SE-A All-Share index, FT-SE 100 or any
relevant sector index.

For those accustomed to the more intuitive atmosphere of Windows-based
software, Pricetrack will take a while to get used to. Although there
are on-screen help files, a comprehensive manual would be an enormous
help as some of the program's features take quite a bit of finding. It
would also be good if basic functions such as Quit could be assigned
the same F key in all modules. The cost of Pricetrack ranges from
pounds 40 per annum for 12 monthly updates to pounds 150 for 50 weekly
ones. In all cases the data supplied is the Friday closing price.

Technical analysts and more active experienced investors will probably
want to look elsewhere, but for the beginner or someone who only uses
fundamental valuation techniques on a long-term basis, Pricetrack is
ideal.

Pricetrack is available from: Pricetrack Ltd, Bicknell Farm, Near

POPULAR SHARES: BP GUSHES GOOD NEWS

British Petroleum is one of the great recovery stories of the past
three years. From dire straits in 1992 as worries over debt and
strategy mounted, the company is now firmly established as the top
explorer among the Seven Sisters - the giant European and US integrated
oil companies. All of the brokers we consulted were impressed with BP's
progress: the basic difference between the bulls and the bears is how
much further the recovery process can go.

At 537p, Morgan Stanley is a strong buyer. The strong exploration and
production portfolio (in Colombia, west of Shetlands, Gulf of Mexico
and Vietnam), and possible earnings enhancement from a restructuring of
the refining operations and continued cost reductions, mean BP is
undervalued relative to its peers. Earnings should grow by 42 per cent
to 38.5p for 1995 with a jump in the dividend to 15p (10.5p). EPS of
40.1p and 43.4p are forecast for 1996 and 1997. The chances of a
special dividend are good as cash flow improves, and the broker expects
the share price to go up to 580p.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett is another buyer. It reckons the shares are cheap
compared with the sector as a whole. Finds like the recently announced
Algerian gas deposits also reinforce the company's position in other
markets.

Natwest Securities is also keen. It's more optimistic than most on oil
prices and expects overcapacity in the refining market to sort itself
out. BP will lead the way in solving it with refinery closures in the
new year.

Kleinwort Benson is more cautious. It says the outlook on oil prices
and the chemicals cycle is not in the company's favour. The shares are
a hold.

Panmure Gordon expresses a similar view. The recovery story has nearly
worked its way through the system. If there is no additional news it
will be hard for the shares to outperform. Shell looks the better bet
as its cost-cutting programme is at a much earlier stage.

Charles Stanley is the only outright seller. It expects chemicals
earnings to be significantly lower this year and dividend growth to
slow after that.

Howden's spread of international businesses has been the key to its
success. Expansion into the developing markets of South Africa and the
Pacific Basin made up for problems in Germany and North America. Almost
two-thirds of its business comes from supplying fans to power-
generation and industrial markets. It found European demand going from
strength to strength and won two contracts to supply power stations in
China. Raw material price rises pushed its North American offshoot into
the red. Tunnelling profits were flat and German tunnelling equipment
maker Wirth is still struggling to break even with margins flattened by
competition and a demand downturn. But an order for offshore drills
from De Beers is good news.

Overall orders are healthy, at pounds 243 up 26 per cent on last year.
Howden's recent fall from the FT-SE Mid 250 index has wiped 25 per cent
off its share price over the last three months as index-tracking funds
have sold up. The slump in the price has left it looking good value
compared with its peers. Broker Bell Lawrie White forecasts full-year
profits rising to pounds 33m giving an inexpensive forward PE ratio of
eight. Good value.

Burndene's shares plummeted 5p on these dismal figures. Profits from
making caravans and operating caravan parks dipped to pounds 3.07m
(pounds 3.76m). Burndene is still reorganising BK Bluebird, the caravan
holiday homes manufacturer it bought last June. The benefits from this
won't show through for several months. Burndene's Willerby Caravan
operation managed to boost exports by 11 per cent, taking overseas
sales to 40 per cent of the total. Pretty Legs Hosiery did well in
spite of hot weather, although second-half profits were slightly lower.
Same-again profits of pounds 3.7m put the shares on a prospective PE
ratio of 13. With the support of a forward yield of 7 per cent the
shares are fairly priced.

Eurotherm has enjoyed 18 months of excellent trading following
recession. Capital investment in the process and paper industries has
returned. Continental European markets are better, and there's been
steady improvement in investment in the plastics industries, fuelling
Eurotherm's product sales. Turnover growth accelerated during the year
under review. First-half sales were up 11 per cent, second-half ones up
20 per cent. But there's been little impact yet from new products. A
new temperature controller was launched in September. More recently
there've been new devices for controlling electric motors and gauges
for use by packaging makers. More products are in the pipeline, the
result of pounds 8.6m (pounds 7.4m) spent on development last year.
That looks set to rise again this year. Eurotherm can well afford it.
It's been criticised for maintaining a large cash pile. But it's
answered this by pushing up its dividend. It's also added a US-based
drives business for pounds 4.4m. Profits are heading for pounds 40m
this year. The shares, on a forward PE ratio of 18, are up with events.

These are the last results from Polar, following an agreed pounds 36m

in component design, now generating over a third of sales. The group
has a lead in display components and microcontrollers. With Abacus at

431p. The partial cash alternative - pounds 60.08 plus 135.66 Abacus
for 100 - is worth 427p. Accept the partial cash alternative.

Like rival Airtours, First Choice suffered in its main UK market,
largely because of the hot summer, which encouraged more people to
holiday at home. It also signalled a cut in capacity for next year,
which will mean the industry as a whole will shave the number of
packages by 15 per cent. That still means that almost 9m holidays will
be on offer.

The past 12 months perfectly examplify what happens when overcapacity
and a hot summer combine to hit First Choice's largest operation,
holidays in UK and Irish Republic. Despite turnover rising 4 per cent
to pounds 702m, profits dived from pounds 15m in 1994 to a loss of
pounds 12m.

First Choice's pounds 44m October rights issue to fund acquisitions,
which will help shift the balance away from summer to winter, will have
relatively little effect on the overall picture at the moment. Even its
market-leading Canadian tour operator, where profits more than doubled
to nearly pounds 8m, provides little in the way of comfort.

The problem is that the year revolves around a couple of months in
summer. If the company gets it right it has no need to shift an
inordinate number of holidays at cut price and margins look healthy. If
not, margins are slaughtered as it's forced to sell holidays at
unacceptable rates. Merrill Lynch expects 1995-96 profits to rebound to
pounds 22m, giving a forward PE ratio of 14. The shares are fairly
priced.

Months after flagging his intention to turn former marquee hirer Black
& Edgington into a pharmaceuticals company, chairman Ian Gowrie-Smith
has announced a massive share issue to fund its first major deal. Mr
Gowrie-Smith will inject Gibraltar-based drug development group Krypton
- majority-owned by his family's trust - into B&E, whose name will be
changed to SkyePharma. Krypton specialises in developing generic drugs,
and is working on anti-diabetic and heart treatments. With no trading
record, SkyePharma is transferring from the USM to Aim, where trading
should begin on 9 January.

The deal more than doubles B&E's ordinary equity to 1.1bn shares. The
group is funding the pounds 12m cost of Krypton by issuing 300m shares.
A one-for-four rights issue plus a 75m share placing at 4p will raise
pounds 9.3m. There are also 10 free warrants for every placing and
rights share. The group now has pounds 3.4m debt, but negative net
assets. After clearing the debt it'll have pounds 6m cash. Investors
also face a future share issue at 4p to raise a pounds 15m deferred
consideration for Krypton. B&E's shares were suspended in November when
it sold its marquee business. The latest loss reflects a pounds 3.8m
provision relating to the disposal and a pounds 5.9m operating loss on
continuing operations. Fairly priced.

The near-pounds 7m acquisition of Clan Asset Management, and of
Baronsmead for about pounds 3m in shares, helped increase funds under
management by pounds 340m. This and injections of investment capital
from two of I&S's institutions helped raise total funds under
management from pounds 3.1bn to pounds 3.7bn. After the pounds 700m
fall in funds in I&S's last full year it's heartening to see the
improved investment performance reflected in greater confidence from
existing clients. Coupled with cost-cutting, which reduced fees paid to
agents steering funds its way by pounds 1m, the gloom of the past year
is lifting. But the more stable base it seeks is another 12 months
away. And replacing lost clients is proving hard to do. Bell Lawrie
White expects full-year profits of pounds 6m, for a forward PE ratio of
18. High enough.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: HOBSON/HILLSDOWN - FOLLOW YOUR LEADER

Hillsdown Holdings' 31p per share cash offer should be enough for the
acquisitive conglomerate to snaffle up small food manufacturer Hobson.
The pounds 121m offer is recommended by Hobson's management. It seems
unlikely now that a third party will intervene.

The price looks fair, but not generous. And there must be a tinge of
disappointment amongst those who backed Hobson's audacious pounds 111m
acquisition of the Co-op's food distribution arm FE Barber in May 1994.

That deal was engineered by Hobson's (then) 28-year-old boss Andrew
Regan. FE Barber was worth five times more than Hobson at the time of
the deal and great things were expected from Mr Regan. Supporters say
he has done everything he promised. Three businesses have been sold,
others closed and overheads slashed. Brokers expect Hobson to make
profits of about pounds 17m in 1995 compared with Barber's pounds 10m
in 1993.

But rumoured deals with Geest and Albert Fisher never materialised. The
shares also remained stuck beneath the 27p price of the pounds 73m
rights issue that funded the Barber purchase.

Talks with Hillsdown apparently have been under way for some time. Mr
Regan's stake in Hobson is worth 'between pounds 2.5m and pounds 3m'.
His recommendation to jump ship now is probably a pretty good
indication that the really hard work still lies ahead. Follow his lead.
Accept.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: GUINNESS PEAT SELLS STOCKBROKER

Sir Ron Brierley's investment vehicle Guinness Peat has finally sold
Brown Shipley Stockbroking (BSS), one of the UK's largest private
stockbrokers. Birmingham-based stockbroker Albert E Sharp will pay
pounds 7.4m. BSS has 30,000 clients and pounds 2bn of funds under
management. It made pre-tax profits of pounds 532,000 in 1994. But a
slump in stock market volumes hit earnings in the first half of 1995.
Guinness Peat bought BSS for only pounds 5.6m two-and-a-half years ago
and since then has netted pounds 2.7m from the sale of its unit trust
and asset management businesses.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: FIRST HYDRO - FOURTH FORCE

There is a new force in UK electricity generation. US-based Mission
Energy is paying pounds 652.5m for First Hydro, the National Grid's
former pumped storage business. The bid beat others, including one from
Scottish Hydro-Electric. At the time of the National Grid flotation
last December First Hydro was valued at pounds 443m.

First Hydro operates two pumped storage stations in North Wales which
provide electricity in periods of peak demand. They pump water into a
reservoir at night and release it to generate power during the day. It
has 2,088MW of generating capacity and in the year to March 1995
profits rose from pounds 45.2m to pounds 74.7m.

Mission has the backing of its parent California-based SCECorp which is
worth nearly pounds 4bn. It already has investments in two gas-powered
generation stations in the UK and is one of four bidders in the running
for the 4,000MW generation capacity being sold by National Power. If it
is successful Mission will become the fourth-largest generator in the
UK and be a major competitor for National Power and PowerGen.

Regional electricity distributors will receive the cash in proportion
to their pre-flotation stakes in the National Grid. The windfall will
total pounds 680m.

NEW ISSUES: CLUBHAUS - WATCH THE BIRDIE

The chance of investing in golf clubs presents itself later this month.
Clubhaus, a golf club operator, is coming to the stock market via a
placing and open offer. Investors still have the chance to climb
aboard. They have until 26 January to buy shares in Ex-Lands, which is
demerging Clubhaus. In exchange for an existing Ex-Lands share, holders
will gain one new share in Ex-Lands plus one in Clubhaus. Dealings in
both new shares will start trading on 12 February.

Currently Ex-Lands' shares are changing hands at 20.5p, leaving some
scope for a first-day premium. Basic assets per share in Ex-Lands
according to the listing particulars is 26.8p.

Ex-Lands new shares should settle around 21.2p if its shares mirror
valuations of other property groups where the average discount to NAV
is around 20 per cent.

The new Clubhaus shares come virtually for free. Shareholders may wish
to top up holdings in this new company. A placing price around 7.5p is
expected. But doing so would inevitably expose investors to greater
risk. The placing should raise around pounds 5m. Even so Clubhaus will
still be nearly 90 per cent geared after taking account of Ex-Lands'
loans.

Clubhaus' golf clubs are mainly in Europe. Of its six clubs, three are
operational - Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart - but none were before
June 1994, so the trading record means little.

Former golf champion Jack Nicklaus designed the Hamburg and Brussels
courses. Golf is still in its infancy, relatively speaking, in Germany
and France.

Further expenditure of at least pounds 22.8m is planned, more than pro-
forma net assets post demerger. The other clubs, or clubs in waiting,
are at Vichy, Brussels and Duke's Dene near London.

Membership revenues come in large blocks, making it difficult to spot
any pattern of recurring fees. As such an investment in Clubhaus
remains speculative.

NEW ISSUES: FIRST MEDIA INVESTMENT TRUST - PLUGGING INTO MULTIMEDIA

Raphael Zorn Hemsley is launching an investment trust specialising in
the media sector. First Media Investment Trust will invest in both
listed and unlisted companies involved in the 'content' side of the
industry. This includes multimedia, computer games, TV broadcasters and
programme producers, music, radio and on-line services.

The trust intends to keep away from direct investment in hardware
makers, although its investments will, of course, use new hardware and
technology. Around 40 per cent of the fund will be invested in the US
with the rest being placed in the UK and Europe.

First Media plans to hold up to 30 per cent of its portfolio in
unlisted shares. The initial intention was to hold half of the assets
in unlisted investments but potential investors were happier with the
lower figure, at least for the time being. The trust will take stakes
of up to 49 per cent in these businesses which are likely to be based
in the UK or Europe. This is where it can really make its money by
getting in early in the life of a business. Much of the uplift in the
value of this kind of business can already have happened before the
shares are floated.

The key, of course, will be picking the right businesses and paying the
right price for a holding. John Scaife, who will be responsible for
identifying investments, has more than a decade of experience of media
investments in corporate finance roles and through his own media
consultancy. His experience should reduce the chances of the fund
making the wrong investment although the greater risk involved in
unlisted investment, especially start-ups and young companies, means
that not all investments will go as planned. First Media needs to make
sure that the successes outweigh any failures.

The aim is to raise up to pounds 100m via a placing at 100p per share -
there will be one warrant for every 10 shares. The minimum subscription
level is set at pounds 40m. The stock exchange has insisted that as the
investment manager, Raphael Zorn Hemsley cannot also be the trust's
sponsor. A sponsor is being sought and the placing should take place by
the end of January.

SMALLER COMPANIES: HARTONS' FLEXIBLE FRIEND

Hartons, the debt-laden Sheffield plastics distributor, has missed its
preference dividend for the last three years, is heavily exposed to the
building trade and, even after a refinancing, faces a long haul to
better trading. So why was its pounds 3m open offer over-subscribed?
The answer is that shareholders had the right to subscribe for all the
shares on offer. And Schuttersveld, the Dutch plastics group backing
Hartons' refinancing, did just that. But even after scaling back to
give other investors a chance, Schuttersveld ended up with 96 per cent
of the new shares. Suter, the industrial conglomerate which owns 30 per
cent of Hartons' preference shares and blocked Hartons' earlier attempt
at a refinancing, did not take up its rights. The result is that the
Dutch company, now with almost half the voting shares, has launched a
mandatory bid for Hartons at 8.5p for each ordinary share. It is
offering a measly 17.71p for each convertible preference share. That is
based on the existing conversion rights and makes no allowance for the
unpaid preference dividends. The offer document, still to go out, will
fill in the details. But even if ordinary shareholders grab their money
with thanks, preference shareholders will be slower to accept the bid.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ENNEMIX ON THE SLAB

Ennemix, the troubled Nottinghamshire aggregates group, is on the
shopping list of building materials giant Redland. The larger company
has bought a 29.99 per cent stake in Ennemix from venture capitalist
Nash Sells & Partners, one of the original shareholders, at 32p a
share. That is almost half the 63p placing price of September 1994 and
a third less than its 48p net asset value. Since flotation the company
has tripped up on acquisitions, seen former employees set up in
competition, faced an unfair dismissal claim from one of its senior
managers, and lost a key planning appeal. The growing dominance of the
big aggregates groups has also raised problems. But at the last count
Ennemix had about 14m tonnes of unconsented reserves. It has told
shareholders to sit tight, although the share price recovery to 36p
from its 20p doldrums must be tempting. Redland has yet to confirm
whether it will bid.

Shareholders in Residential Property Trust lobbed the company's

in its December placing and open offer will go to the professional
advisers. The lucky few include merchant bank Hill Samuel, stockbroker
Credit Lyonnais, auditor Arthur Andersen and lawyer Morgan Bruce. The
cash will help pay for the pounds 2.75m acquisition of property
management company PKL. Finance director Chris Eales says: 'The costs
were certainly at the high end and obviously were something we tried to
lessen as much as possible. But in effect this was a reversal and means
a relisting of the shares. We were relaunching the company.' The shares
are suspended at 105p until the deal is done.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ENVIROMED STALKED?

EN plc is tightening its grip on healthcare group Enviromed. Associated

its interest to an 18 per cent stake. Mr Zwanziger is believed to be
acting in concert with other former Enviromed directors. Enviromed
chairman Sir Geoffrey Allen has had discussions with EN though its
intentions are still not clear. Enviromed, which suffered a pre-tax
loss of pounds 4.9m in the six months ended March, last month sold a
big chunk of its Cambridge Veterinary Sciences (CVS) business for
pounds 510,000. CVS was acquired for pounds 1.1m a year ago. Enviromed
retains CVS's fluoroimmunoassay technology, whose acquisition was a
principal reason for the original deal. Enviromed managing director Tom
Murphy wants the company to focus on diagnostics businesses in specific
areas.

Lep has been in trouble since the early 1990s. It fell into loss in

plan left banks with 85 per cent of the company. But the remaining debt
still proved too much to handle.

base and recovery in trading. Given OIS's poor track record, it's
likely to have an uphill battle to convince investors not to accept the

SMALLER COMPANIES: WATER HALL - DISSENTING VOICES

EDWARD Weiss, chairman of quarry services group Water Hall, is fighting
for his job. Fellow director Raschid Abdullah has called an EGM for 25
January to remove Mr Weiss and replace him with Anthony Smith, formerly
with Wagon Industrial. Given the chairman has a casting vote, Mr
Abdullah and Mr Smith could then effectively take control of Water
Hall's four-man board.

Mr Abdullah has fallen out with Mr Weiss and Water Hall's other
directors about the future direction of the company. Whereas Mr Weiss
would prefer to see Water Hall stick with its existing businesses, as
was the intention at the time of a rescue refinancing a year ago, Mr
Abdullah wants to turn it into a cash shell ahead of a move into the
industrial or distribution sectors.

The contest is likely to be close. Including the interests of his
brothers Ahmed and Osman, the latter was previously the company's chief
executive, Mr Abdullah already has the support of shareholders owning
10.37 per cent of the company. Arab investors control about 45 per cent
of the shares though it's unclear how these investors will vote.
Another potential stumbling block is that Water Hall is supposed to
roll over its banking facilities in about a fortnight. Whether bankers
are prepared to continue their support following a board share-up isn't
known.

SMALLER COMPANIES: MIGHTY WEETABIX

Despite the pressures on supermarket shelf space from own-label
cereals, fed in part by fierce price competition among the multiples,
full-year figures from Weetabix were excellent. Pre-tax profits rose a
tenth to pounds 31.3m on sales up a similar amount at pounds 240m.
Weetabix also had to contend with high world wheat prices and with a
proliferation of new products in the market. Despite continuing high
levels of advertising spend to support its range of brands, net cash
rose by pounds 8.8m over the year. Alpen increased its sales nicely
thanks to the introduction of Alpen Nutty Crunch, while Frosted Chex
and Honey Nut Chex, launched in 1994, have both achieved good
distribution. Overall, Weetabix is clearly managing to balance the
tricky equation between selling its own brands and having to supply
supermarkets with own-label products. Weetabix Limited was awarded the
Gold Medal of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors for 1995, a
credit to the company but also a reflection of just how hard it has to
work to keep profits moving forward. The businesses in North America
performed strongly; the investment programme there has led to a
considerable improvement in the gross margin. Until Ofex started, the
shares were traded under 4.2(a). A year ago they were at pounds 18.60,
so have done better than the market. Weetabix may not be able to buck
the pressure the own-label trend is putting on its brands indefinitely.
At pounds 26.25, high enough.

'promoting it like mad'.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ONE-OFFS HIT NPC

Hot summer weather reduced demand for city-centre parking spaces
according to National Parking Corporation (NPC), the owner of National
Car Parks and Green Flag, the vehicle breakdown recoverer and repairer.
NPC is the largest company whose shares are traded on Ofex. The costs
of the increased borrowings taken on as a result of last year's 155p
special dividend also hit its figures for the 28 weeks to mid-October
1995. A change in accounting policy which means NPC now charges
depreciation on its buildings lopped another pounds 3.5m off profits.
Pre-tax profits slipped from pounds 27.4m to pounds 21m on turnover up
7 per cent to pounds 168m. Stripping out these costs, though, the
underlying performance of the businesses improved despite the summer
heatwave. Operating profits were 4 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period last year. England football team sponsor Green
Flag continues to rise. Recognition of the Green Flag name is growing
and the company intends to utilise this by launching new services under
this brand. NPC is a strong cash generator and this will enable it to
pay off the borrowings incurred to pay the special dividend. Following
the breakdown of buyout talks last year, NPC plans to obtain a full
listing in 1999. The shares are currently 465p valuing the company at
pounds 547m. About right.

Market makers: 1                            Market made by Ofex

JUST, the character licensing group traded on Ofex, expects 1996 to be
an exciting year. It hopes to announce some major deals and talks are
in progress with a number of big companies. At this stage, Just is coy
about releasing details.

About half of Just's sales are currently generated from its successful
In My Pocket range. It owns the rights to this range. Beginning with
Puppy In My Pocket in 1994, the concept has been extended to cover
Kitty, Pony and more recently Teddy In My Pocket figures. Over 60
million of these figures have been sold to British children, impressive
market penetration. Last month, it signed a new three-year deal with
toy maker Vivid Imaginations. Royalties from the deal could be worth
around pounds 2m. The In My Pocket range is also being expanded
internationally with distribution in 35 new territories this year. And
Just is considering the potential of an animation series.

In addition, Just acts on behalf of brand owners, licencing out rights
to third parties. Licences include BMG's The Wind in the Willows
Collection, Cadbury's parrot, Bertie Bassett and Jelly Babies. It also
handles corporate brand merchandising for Cadbury's, Raleigh and
Matchbox.

The next leg to Just's expansion could be funded by a mixture of debt
and equity. Alternatively it could consider joint ventures to ease its
shares of the financial burden. In 1995, it is likely to generate pre-
tax profits of about pounds 300,000 on turnover of pounds 2m, which
puts the shares on a PE ratio of less than 7.

Just is in the early stages of its development. The shares have
speculative appeal; good value.

ANALYSIS: POLYMASC'S MEDICAL SOAP OPERA

Polymasc Pharm'l - PEGylation technology developer

Good value

Touch: 125-132p                     1995 High: 127p Low: 100p

Market makers: 2                    Traded on Aim

POLYMASC is a spin-off from London's Royal Free Hospital School of
Medicine. The medical school and the founding scientists, who own over
half the company, stand to become biotechnology millionaires if the
company's technologies, used to make it easier to treat conditions
ranging from kidney failure to cancer, reach their intended market.

The science boils down to a technique - called molecule altering
structural chemistry or MASC - for attaching a polymer, polyethylene
glycol (PEG), to some types of drug, specifically proteins, peptides
and liposomes. The PEG disguises the drugs from the body, allowing them
stay in the body longer. The result is happier patients because they
need lower doses and fewer injections.

The company argues that other types of PEGylation all have drawbacks.
So far the technique has watered down the benefit from the drug itself
or has needed a potentially toxic coupling agent to tie up the drug.
The gains from beating these problems and applying the result in
oncology, haematology, gene therapy and the treatment of genetic and
enzyme deficiencies make a compelling story.

But it will take time to develop. The first market will be in replacing
existing drugs with its own PEGylation technologies. Polymasc will not
disclose what it is developing, but it has three development contracts
under way. It does say that it has already applied its technologies to
two drugs - erythropoietin (Epo) and GM-CSF, used in treating anaemia
and white blood cell deficiency respectively.

Shares in Polymasc, placed at 100p, started trading at 127p just before
Christmas. Polymasc is using pounds 750,000 of the pounds 4.47m raised
in the placing to buy assets from the medical school. In theory,
Polymasc should have enough money to keep going until it hits breakeven
in 1997, but the risk remains that losses will continue for longer than
expected and the company will need to raise more money. One US company,
Enzon, already works in a similar field and Polymasc must show that its
technologies go one step further along. Even if all goes to plan, the
first products should only reach the market in 2001. But for investors
who understand the enormous risks of the biotechnology game and the
long wait for results, Polymasc is good value.

SMALLER COMPANIES: J&S STRENGTHENS

Abrasive machine tool designer and maker Jones & Shipman is building on
the recovery experienced in the second half of 1994-95. In the six
months ended September, it generated pre-tax profits of pounds 619,000
(pounds 897,000 loss) on sales up by nearly half to pounds 8.9m. J&S
generates more than three-fifths of sales overseas and reports strong
levels of business in North America, more than a quarter of group
sales, and France. But on a more cautious note, the company says there
has been a slowdown in the rate of growth in its order book in recent
months. That's hardly surprising given its strong rise over the last 12
months or so. And although November was a little disappointing,
December was J&S's best month in around seven years. House broker
Albert E Sharp is sticking with its full-year profits forecast of
pounds 1.3m. With the shares off the boil at 46p, the forward PE ratio
is 13 assuming a full tax charge. Good value.

SMALLER COMPANIES: TOTAL DISAPPOINTS

Life is proving difficult for software writer and supplier Total
Systems. In the six months ended September, it made a pounds 55,000
loss (pounds 7,000 profit). Sales rose 16 per cent to pounds 1.3m, a
smaller increase than Total would have liked. Another drag on profits
was investments Total has made in new software products. Just over a
third of sales go to the insurance market and chairman Terry Bourne
says Total has developed new software products in general insurance
systems that are 'state-of-the-art'. Even so, he complains of too much
resistance to change among information technology specialists. Total
hopes to return to the days when it was considered a high flyer. But
that won't happen in 1995-96 when it will be lucky to break even. At
21p, high enough.

There's been a bust-up at Quayle Munro after which co-founder Michael
Munro has left suddenly, leaving behind chief executive Ian Jones. The
company, though, has got steadily busier since March. That can be seen
in better second- half results for 1994-95 following a 10 per cent fall
in interim profits. Boosting this year's figures will be a gain on the
sale of shares in Parkside following its recent takeover by British
Polythene.

Tuskar's latest accounts are quiet about exploration projects in
eastern Europe as several discussions have come to nothing. So its
short-term turnover remains dependent on its near 1 per cent production
interest in BP's mature Buchan Field. But it should soon know the
results of Mobil's deep well being drilled on a North Sea gas prospect
off Yorkshire - there it has a 5 per cent interest.

raising and issued shares to reduce rent obligations. Much of the new
money has been used to pay off creditors. To save cash it has also
closed its loss-making interiors division and its Berlin office. Last

Last year Rangers won its seventh consecutive Scottish Premier League
Championship with an unbeaten run from November to January. That
success, coupled with capacity crowds at most home games, gave a big
boost to turnover and made up for an early exit from European
competition. Profits also benefited from a fall in the net cost of
players' registrations. But four recent transfer deals, including Paul
Gascoigne, suggest a return to losses this year.

Transense's non-contact torque sensors aim to make it economical to put
power steering into small cars with engines below 1,600 cc. But short
term the motor industry has switched to the cheaper hybrid technology,
electrohydraulic power steering, which may speed up the use of
Transense's sensors in the production of volume cars. It's produced a
number of EHPS prototypes and road tests have been completed on a
Renault Clio.

Anglesey's new-look board is keen to reactivate mining on Parys

structure, as its main shareholder, a Bermudan company, owns 29 per
cent of its shares and is also by far its largest creditor (for pounds
1.79m at end-March) - fees due to professional advisers come next.
Parys Mountain has been mined since Roman times and has significant

The jump in sales and increased house completions from 172 to 292 shows
how hard Bellwinch tried to increase profits in 1994-95. But weak
demand and margins squeezed by higher land costs and rising raw
material prices largely thwarted it and led to results much below early
1995 expectations. Bellwinch reports a poor first quarter this year.

In June software supplier DCS bought a larger private rival, Computing
Services for Industry, for pounds 8.2m in shares. That deal reduces the
company's 80 per cent reliance on motor industry customers and
increases market share for manufacturing and distribution software. On
sales this year of some pounds 26m broker Granville Davies expects
profits of pounds 1.8m and earnings of 6.9p after a 30 (22) per cent
tax charge.
