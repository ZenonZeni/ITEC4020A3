AS&M is a research and development company that has spent fifteen years specializing in a variety of aerospace related disciplines. One such discipline, coatings of materials, has emerged as one of AS&M's leading research areas. This can be attributed to industry¹s demand for corrosion protection coupled with AS&M's strong background in materials science.<P>

Primary focus has been on sol-gel coatings which can be used for forming oxide coatings on a variety of substrates. One coating which has developed at AS&M while working on the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program is a two-phase glass (TPG) coating. This coating was designed in cooperation with NASA-Langely Research Center, to protect titanium alloys from oxidation and hot corrosion at high temperatures (750-1200C). Success in this program has lead to further development for other applications, particularly in the aerospace and power generation industry. Currently, further development is being funded through a Phase II contract with the Navy at Cherry Point, NC. The objective is to help increase the service life of a jet engine by protecting its turbine blades from oxidation and hot corrosion. Ultimately, this will save a considerable amount of maintenance costs that are incurred from costly repairs.<P>

In addition to the turbine blade industry, this coating has also shown great promise in applications with similar environmental conditions. Thermocouples, automobile engine valves, and high-speed missile surfaces are areas that can use the protective nature of this coating. AS&M plan s to market this coating to the commercial turbine engine, automobile, and defense industry.<P>
