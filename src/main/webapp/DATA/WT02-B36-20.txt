10TH CIR.: WILLIAMS BOUND
TO BUY GAS BEYOND 20-YEAR
TERM OF 'TAKE-OR-PAY' PACT

     The 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5 that,
under the terms of a 20-year "take-or-pay" natural gas purchase
contract forged in 1982, Williams Natural Gas Co. is obliged to
continue buying gas beyond the contract period if the plaintiff
sellers do not revise prices or contract terms.  Talus Properties
Limited Partnership et al. v. Williams Natural Gas Co., No. 95-
1056 (10th Cir.).

     Seeking reversal of a U.S. District Court ruling affirming
the validity of the contracts with plaintiffs Yuma County Oil
Co., Talus Properties Limited Partnership and others for natural
gas produced in Yuma County, CO, Williams argued that the
agreements were ambiguous.  Williams said the U.S. District Court
for the District of Colorado erred in rejecting its request to
enter extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent to remedy the
ambiguity.  It also said the trial judge erred in not reaching
its claim in favor of reformation of the agreements.

     In a non-binding order and judgment, the 10th Circuit said
the contracts were clear and unambiguous.  "The primary term of
each of the contracts is twenty years.  Once the primary term
expires, the contract will remain in effect under the same terms
and conditions, unless, during the allotted time periods, the
respective plaintiffs offer to sell the defendant the gas under
different terms and conditions," the panel ruled.  "Because the
relevant provisions are unambiguous, defendant cannot introduce
extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict their terms."

     The panel said Williams' purported extrinsic data is not
permitted because it is not evidence of additional contract
terms.  "Under the plain language of the contracts, defendant
continues to be obligated to purchase gas from plaintiffs after
the expiration of the primary term unless plaintiffs offer
defendant a new price for the gas, which defendant rejects.
Defendant, however, wants to introduce extrinsic evidence that it
contends establishes that defendant has no obligation to purchase
gas from plaintiffs after the expiration of the primary term.
Because the evidence would vary, rather than supplement, the
written terms, it is not admissible under the guise of CO Rev.
Stat. Sec. 4-2-202(b)."

     The 10th Circuit's opinion, by Circuit Judge Deanell Reece
Tacha, said there was no evidence to support Williams' claim that
the contracts should be reformed because of the mutual mistake of
both parties of not including provisions for a drop in natural
gas prices.

     "The provisions at issue originated with defendant and
became part of the final contracts without any discussion by the
parties.  Nothing suggests that plaintiffs failed to consider the
possibility of future declining prices when they executed the
respective contracts," concluded the court.  "To the contrary,
the contracts work to plaintiffs' advantage in a declining
market.  Nor is there any evidence that plaintiffs knew at the
time they executed the contracts that defendant's assent to the
contracts was based on its mistaken belief that future gas prices
would not fall."

DC CIR. VOIDS FERC'S
INTERPRETATION OF 1968
GAS SALE CONTRACT

     The District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Dec. 12 vacated a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order that
said a 1975 gas sale contract between Jack Grynberg and Rocky
Mountain Natural Gas Co. was illegal because the gas sold under
the pact was dedicated to interstate commerce in a 1968 contract
between Grynberg and another interstate pipeline.  Grynberg et
al. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Nos. 94-1699 and 95-
1134 (DC Cir.).

     The court's ruling comes after both Grynberg and Rocky
Mountain challenged the FERC's finding that since the Colorado-
produced gas had been dedicated to interstate commerce, the
maximum lawful price would be lower than the price paid by Rocky
Mountain.  Grynberg contested the FERC's dedication to commerce
ruling, while Rocky Mountain challenged the Commission's refusal
to order Grynberg to refund certain overpayments.

     In an opinion by Judge A. Raymond Randolph, the DC Circuit
said that, even in allowing jurisdictional deference, the FERC's
interpretation of the 1968 agreement between Grynberg and
Mountain Fuel Co. was "not reasonable" because that contract did
not tie future production from those fields to interstate
commerce usage.  The panel remanded the case for further FERC
review without considering Rocky Mountain's petition.

     "The Commission's reading of the contract is entitled to
judicial respect..., but here the Commission has gone beyond a
fair construction to reach a result it has not supported," said
the DC Circuit.  "The Commission viewed the 1968 agreement as
having dedicated all of the gas underlying the fields described
in the contract to Mountain Fuel."  The FERC, said the panel,
improperly derived its finding from an introductory "Whereas"
clause in the beginning of the 1968 contract which states:
"WHEREAS, Seller owns or controls, and desires to sell and Buyer
desires to purchase Seller's share of gas underlying the lands
and leaseholds (subject lands) described in Appendix 'A'...."

     The DC Circuit said the FERC reached its conclusion based on
the introductory clause and "brush[ing] aside" a subsequent part
of the contract (Article II-1) prohibiting application of the
1968 contract to lands adjoining the pertinent wells.  "Ignoring
the rest of the contract, the Commission offers little more than
an assertion to support its idea that the prefatory Whereas
clause defines the scope of the dedication," wrote Judge
Randolph.  "According to the Commission, Grynberg agreed to sell
all of the gas underlying the subject lands to Mountain Fuel.
But if the Whereas clause defines the extent of the obligation to
sell and dedicates all of the gas to Mountain Fuel, what is the
role of Article II-1?"

     Nancy J. Skancke of Grammer, Kissel, Robbins & Skancke
represents Grynberg.  The FERC is represented by Commission
Attorney Jill L. Hall and Solicitor Jerome M. Feit.  John T.
Miller Jr. argued the cause for intervenor Rocky Mountain.  All
are located in Washington, DC.

5TH CIRCUIT VACATES
APPOINTMENT OF CAJUN
BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE

     Holding that a trial court's appointment of a bankruptcy
trustee for debtor Cajun Electric Cooperative is not in the best
interest of the parties involved, as required under 11 U.S.C.
Sec. 1104(a)(2), a divided Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Nov. 20 vacated the appointment at the request of Cajun and
several of its creditors.  In re Cajun Electric Power
Cooperative, Inc.; Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. v.
Central Louisiana Electric Co., Inc., No. 95-30760 (5th Cir.);
see Utilities Industry LR, July 1995.

     After making a threshold determination that the appointment
of a trustee by a district court sitting in bankruptcy is a final
appealable order, the Fifth Circuit ruled 2-1 that such an
appointment here was wrong because it was based on the trial
court's incorrect assumption that there was a conflict of
interest in the makeup of Cajun's board of directors.

     Cajun chose Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after
sustaining major losses from investments in the ill-fated River
Bend Nuclear Power Facility and then being ordered to lower its
rates by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.  The court
below appointed a bankruptcy trustee for Cajun after board
difficulty by board members in deciding whether to appeal the PSC
order.

     Although the board voted to appeal the rate reduction
ruling, the trial judge said the decision was complicated by the
fact that many Cajun board members were either managers or board
members of Cajun's 12 member companies, all of whom bought power
from Cajun.  A vote to appeal would mean they were attempting to
raise rates for their subsidiary companies; not to appeal would
mean added difficulty for Cajun to pay its debt obligation.  A
trustee was appointed at the request of Rural Utility Service
(RUS), the federal agency from which Cajun received a $1.6
billion loan to invest in River Bend.

     On appeal, the Fifth Circuit majority said that the
appointment of a trustee is an extraordinary remedy under Sec.
1104(a)(1), one for which the moving parties failed to meet their
burden of proof.  The panel said that while the district court
offered several reasons for its decision, they all stemmed from
the inherent conflict between the interests of its member-
customers and those of its creditors.

     "However, because this inherent conflict results from
Cajun's organizational structure " a structure that Congress
encouraged it to adopt " the conflict is insufficient to justify
the appointment of a trustee," said the majority in an opinion by
Judge Reynaldo G. Garza.  "The fact that Congress and the RUS
encouraged " if not required Cajun to organize itself as a
cooperative leads us to believe that any conflict inherently
arising from Cajun's organization as a cooperative is
insufficient to justify the appointment of a trustee."

     "Further," the panel added, "holding that these inherent
conflicts constitute cause for appointing a trustee would create
a per se rule permitting the appointment of a trustee in any case
involving a cooperative."

     Writing in dissent, Judge Emilio M. Garza disagreed with the
majority's per se rule assumption, saying the trustee's
appointment should stand.

     "The conflicts present in this case go beyond the 'inherent'
conflicts under which all healthy cooperatives operate," he said.
"Presumably, healthy cooperatives do not fail to collect monies
owed by member-customers or attempt to deny member-customers
access to information.  Nor do members in healthy cooperatives
consider strategies which seem designed to break-up and scavenge
the assets of the debtor....  Once cooperative members begin
working at cross-purposes, to the extent Cajun's members have,
the appointment of a trustee may be the only effective way to
pursue reorganization."

CONVICTION REVERSED IN
DESTRUCTION OF KY NATURAL
GAS TRANSMISSION TOWER

     A divided Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Nov. 29
reversed the conviction of a defendant who hired people who
mistakenly destroyed an interstate transmission tower owned by a
natural gas company.  United States v. Howard, No. 95-5433
(6th Cir.).

     The 2-1 majority said defendant Ricky Nelson Howard did not
intend to destroy an interstate transmission facility but had
mistakenly targeted the wrong tower.

     Howard, who owned a Kentucky cable television company,
offered to pay a man $1,000 to destroy a tower operated by a
competitor, but mistakenly pointed out a nearby Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp. tower as the target.  That man recruited a
friend to assist.  When Howard refused to pay the $1,000 fee
because the wrong tower had been destroyed, the disgruntled
accomplice contacted the FBI.

     An Eastern District of Kentucky grand jury indicted all
three for conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the destruction
of an interstate facility under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety
Act (NGPSA).  The two men who carried out the destruction pleaded
guilty.  A jury convicted Howard at trial before Judge Joseph M.
Hood.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed in an unpublished, 2-1 per curiam
decision.

     Howard unsuccessfully argued the Columbia Gas tower was a
communication rather than transmission facility and was not a
pipeline facility under NGPSA; it had an electronic system to
convert pipeline pressures and flow rates into electrical signals
and to transmit the results to a central monitoring location.  He
also unsuccessfully argued the tower was exempt from protection
under NGPSA because it was located in a rural area.

     However, the majority said the conviction must be reversed
because the conspirators lacked specific intent to cut down a gas
tower.  As a result, it said a jury could not reasonably conclude
that the defendants knowingly and willfully destroyed a gas
pipeline facility.

     Dissenting, Judge Harry W. Wellford said the mistake as to
ownership of the Columbia Gas tower was insufficient for
reversal.  Howard, in fact, did point out the Columbia Gas tower
to a co-conspirator, he said.

11TH CIR.: GA PRISON
OFFICIALS DUE IMMUNITY IN
POWER CONTRACT BID SUIT

               Although ruling that two low-bidding electric cooperatives
held a state-created property right in electrical service
contracts granted to high-bidder Georgia Power Co. by Georgia's
Department of Corrections (DOC), the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals on Nov. 15 reversed a district court's denial of
qualified immunity for DOC officials and remanded the case for
further state law action.  Flint Electrical Membership Corp. v.
Whitworth et al.; Pataula Electric Membership Corp. v. Whitworth
et al., Nos. 94-9199 and 94-9227 (11th Cir.).

     The court's action came in the consolidated treatment of
separate lawsuits by Flint Electrical Membership Corp. and
Pataula Electric Membership Corp. (the EMCs), which claimed they
were denied their due process rights to supply power to certain
DOC facilities when DOC violated Georgia's State Purchasing Act
and awarded the contracts to Georgia Power.

     U.S. District Judge Horace T. Ward of the Northern District
of Georgia originally dismissed the actions on the pleadings for
failure to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, holding that
the EMCs had no federally protected property interest in the
contracts.  The 11th Circuit, in an earlier ruling, reversed
Judge Ward on the grounds that Georgia law requires electrical
service contracts to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder
"whenever possible."

     Holding that DOC officials should have known the are
required to follow competitive bidding procedures, the 11th
Circuit remanded the case to trial court, where DOC and Georgia
Power, also a defendant, moved for summary judgment.  Upon the
court's denial of all such motions, the DOC officials appealed to
the 11th Circuit.

     In a per curiam opinion, the panel found that although the
EMC's right to a property interest in the contracts remain, the
DOC defendants are now entitled to qualified immunity due to a
change in the law under the 11th Circuit's 1994 ruling in
McKinney v. Pate.  In that case, the 11th Circuit held that Sec.
1983 substantive due process claims arising from nonlegislative
deprivations of state-created property interests are no longer
cognizable in the circuit.

     The panel noted that the EMCs should have, but did not, file
suit against DOC in state court under Georgia law O.C.G.A. Sec.
50-5-79, designed to challenge the issuance of improperly bid
state contracts.  "Because they failed to do so, and because the
rule of law announced in McKinney must be applied
retroactively..., their Sec. 1983 due process claims are not
actionable," the court concluded.

DEMAND EXCUSED BY MAJORITY
HOLDER'S INFLUENCE ON
BOARD MEMBER, SAYS DE CT.

     A shareholder plaintiff was excused from making pre-suit
demand on the board of York Research Corp. by a Delaware state
court judge who on Dec. 4 found that a majority of the board
lacked independence due to a dominant director/shareholder's
ability to exert "considerable influence" over a swing vote
director.  Friedman v. Beningson et al., No. 12232 (DE Ch. Ct.).

     In his memorandum opinion, Chancellor William T. Allen
rejected a motion to dismiss breach of duty and insider trading
charges from Delaware Chancery Court, finding that in order to
allege lack of independence, it was not necessary to show that
the swing vote director's continued employment and remuneration
hinged solely on the whim of the controlling director.

     At issue in the derivative suit by Irving Friedman was the
decision of York Research Corp. " a Delaware company that
develops, constructs and operates co-generation power plants " to
issue interest-free loans to several of its directors and
officers so that they could buy large blocks of stock in the
company.  According to the complaint, the directors and officers
then made false statements regarding revenue growth and future
business prospects to inflate York's stock price and sold their
shares before announcing that revenues would be significantly
below projections.

     Friedman alleged that the defendant officers and directors
not only misused corporate office but cost the company a $500,000
settlement used to obtain the dismissal of shareholder securities
suits in federal court in New York City.

     After the suit was amended, defendants in July 1993 moved to
dismiss it for failure to make demand on the board before
initiating the action.  Friedman contended that he was excused
from making pre-suit demand because the majority of the three
board members lacked both independence and disinterest.  He said
defendant York director/president Robert Beningson was the
mastermind of the interest-free loan and insider trading scheme
and that he exerted a controlling interest over board member John
Ellis through his control of his remuneration.

     The court said it need only address the first prong of the
two-prong test used in Aronson v. Lewis, DE Sup. 473 A.2d 805, 8
(1984), i.e., whether plaintiff has alleged particularized facts
creating a reasonable doubt whether those directors could, under
the circumstances, exercise a judgment on the suit and demand
that would qualify for the deference of the business judgment
rule.

     "This inquiry may include the subject whether some or all
directors are 'beholden' to or under the control, domination or
strong influence of a party with a material financial interest in
the transaction under attack, which interest is adverse to that
of the corporation," the court wrote.  "Such circumstances alone
may sometimes raise a reasonable doubt that directors in such a
situation could exercise judgment on behalf of the corporation
concerning the transaction involving such dominant or influential
party."

     The court noted that the state Supreme Court held in Rales
v. Blasband, DE Sup. 634 A.2d 927, 936, that "although the
director/officer's continued employment and remuneration did not
hinge solely on his relations with the defendant directors, the
official authority of the defendant directors 'placed them in a
position to exert considerable influence over the director
officer.'"  Ellis's continued receipt of consulting fees,
"...when considered in the context of the other facts alleged,
represents a substantial interest subject to possible corporate
retribution had he exercised judgment in a way displeasing to the
financially interested shareholder/CEO," the court concluded.

     The court also noted that Beningson's ties to York's
principal client empower him in relation to the other directors,
"...since they must remain cognizant of and sensitive to his
ability to affect York's business prospects."  The chancellor
also noted (1) the size of the loans " the loan to Beningson was
greater than the company's net revenue that year; and (2) York's
settlement of the federal class actions without any director
contribution, despite the profits earned by Beningson.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and John Day
of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington; and Ronald
Futterman and Michael Behn of Futterman & Howard, Chtd. in
Chicago.

     Defendants are represented by Richard Elliot Jr. and Thomas
Beck of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington; and Roger
Waldman and Philip Zimmerman of Moses & Singer in New York City.

CA CT. GRANTS JUDGMENT
FOR DEFENSE IN OFFICE
EMF EXPOSURE CASE

     Holding that the plaintiffs would be unable to submit causal
evidence associating electromagnetic field exposure to the
development of cancer in humans, a California Superior Court
judge on Dec. 8 granted defendant Southern California Edison's
(SCE) motion for summary judgment in a suit by office workers who
say they developed cancer due to the location of an SCE
transformer beneath their office.  Johsz et al. v. Koll Co. et
al., No. 726765 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.); see Utilities
Industry LR, October 1995.

     Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Warren Siegel said he
agreed with SCE's assertion that plaintiffs' proffered testimony
would not meet the Kelly-Frye admissibility test as laid out in
the California Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in People v. Kelly.
Such testimony, which was to have been given at trial beginning
this month, he said, failed to conclusively say EMFs caused
plaintiff's cancers.  The testimony expected from plaintiffs'
experts Samuel Milham, M.D., M.P.H., and David Michael Ozonoff,
M.D., suggested only that "there is a causal association; that
based on statistics it 'may' be a cause," the judge ruled.

     The judge added, "Statistics may lend credence to an opinion
that EMF caused plaintiff's cancers, but there is no expert
opinion that it did in these cases and Ozonoff and Milham are the
only causation experts proposed by the plaintiffs on the EMF
issue."

     Co-defendants Koll Co. and Grubb & Ellis joined in the
utility's summary judgment motion.

     Plaintiffs Michael and Jill Johsz, James and Christianne
Nichols, and Mary Ann Stewart voluntarily withdrew their causes
of action for battery and fraudulent concealment and their
request for punitive damages after SCE moved for summary judgment
on Nov. 7.  Plaintiff attorney Annee Della Donna, who plans to
file a motion for a new trial this month, says the ruling does
not affect companion cases Younkin v. Southern California Edison
(see Utilities Industry LR, September 1995, P. 11,032), in which
a March settlement conference is slated, or Muir v. Southern
California Edison (see Utilities Industry LR, June 1995), which
is scheduled for trial on May 20, 1996.

     The plaintiffs discounted SCE's summary judgment motion
claim that the Kelly-Frye test is inapplicable, arguing that it
applies only to admissibility of "new scientific methods, devices
or techniques" in criminal cases.  Instead, they said that their
conclusions and opinions should be judged, and are shown
reliable, under the 35-year-old "Hill Criteria," developed in
England.  The Hill Criteria, they argued, include strength,
consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, coherence, experiment and analogy.

     "Plaintiffs argue that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicable
to the scientific principle of whether EMF causes cancer, but
rather is limited to novel scientific techniques, methods or
tests," SCE responded.  "In support of this argument, plaintiffs
cite several California decisions which have held that the Kelly-
Frye rule is not applicable to medical opinion testimony based on
an examination of a particular physical or psychological injury."

     "However," the utility continued, "the cases cited by
plaintiffs on this point are inapposite in that the issue with
respect to Edison's motion for summary judgment is not the
admissibility of medical opinion testimony that EMF caused
plaintiffs' specific cancers, but rather the admissibility of
scientific evidence on the threshold issue of whether EMF causes
cancer generally.  This distinction is highlighted by the fact
that the expert declarations submitted to plaintiffs in
opposition to Edison's motion for summary judgment do not
indicate that either of the declarants have ever examined any of
the plaintiffs in this action, but rather base their opinions
solely upon scientific literature and epidemiologic studies
regarding the health effects of EMF."

     Opposing SCE's motion, the plaintiffs challenged the
qualifications of defense experts Philip Cole, M.D., Chairman of
the University of Alabama School of Public Health's Department of
Epidemiology; and Jack D. Sahl, M.S., M.P.H., Ph.D, an SCE
research scientist since 1983.  Both men, the plaintiffs argued,
"are so tied to the utility companies that their testimony is not
credible."

     SCE replied, "in contrast to the declaration of Dr. Cole
[that there is no causal relationship between human cancer
development and EMF exposure], the declarations submitted by
plaintiffs are devoid of any reference to general acceptance
within the scientific community of the principle that EMF causes
cancer.  Rather than addressing the consensus of the scientific
community, Dr. Milham simply states that there are a number of
biological mechanisms by which EMF 'may' cause cancer, that EMF
'may' affect and compromise the immune system, and that, in his
opinion, EMF exposure promotes a number of cancers."

     The plaintiffs are represented by Della Donna and Wylie A.
Aitken of the Law Offices of Wylie A. Aitken in Santa Ana, CA.
SCE is represented by Duncan Barr and Joel C. Lamp of O'Connor,

CA COURT VOIDS FRAUD,
CONDEMNATION, NUISANCE
CLAIMS AGAINST TANC

     A California Superior Court judge ruled Nov. 21 that the
plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proving that the
Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) committed fraud
in refusing to disclose the potential dangers of electromagnetic
fields when it acquired a 200-foot-wide right-of-way across their
100-acre farm in 1991.  Jess et al. v. Transmission Agency of
Northern California et al., No. V-0072568 (CA Super. Ct., Alameda
Cty.); see Utilities Industry LR, Feb. 15, 1994.

     Judge Richard A. Hodge said that although TANC had a duty to
inform John Jess Jr. and his wife, Nell Jess, of the "existence
of a public controversy" concerning the effects of EMF on human
health, TANC did not defraud the couple when TANC right-of-way
agent Robert Gray negotiated a deal to purchase the 11.4-acre
strip of land for $80,960.  Claims for reasonably foreseeable
health hazards resulting from the placement of the 500kV
transmission line, the court added, are moot under a waiver
contained in the right-of-way contract.

     The fraud, inverse condemnation and nuisance suit charged
TANC with failure to reveal that the operation of the line at
full capacity would result in a 1 milligauss (mG) EMF or more
over an area of up to 600 feet from the center of the
transmission line.  The complainants said there was a diminution
of the value of their property as a result of the EMF and that
there was an interference with their use and enjoyment of their
property.

     Weighing the testimony of opposing property appraisers,
Judge Hodge said the estimated valuation drop suggested by
claimants' appraiser Arthur Gimmy was inconclusive because it
failed to differentiate between the loss attributed to EMF fear
and that due to the general installation of a high voltage line
across a rural property.

     "The court...was not persuaded that Mr. Gimmy had adequately
distinguished loss of value from perceived health problems from
loss of value attributed to the manifold negatives otherwise
associated with transmission lines," Judge Hodge wrote.  "In this
regard, it is important to observe that the plaintiffs negotiated
their easement and right-of-way contracts with full appreciation
of the visual, aural, and 'convenience' negatives.  Presumably,
the plaintiffs calculated these negatives in their acceptance of
the $80,960 contract price."

     The court ruled, "The fact that EMF MAY engender biological
effects of unknown consequence is not sufficient to establish a
basis for damages.  Plaintiffs' proof of actual harm derived from
asserted biological effects of EMF has been singularly lacking in
persuasive force."

     Judge Hodge concluded, "Plaintiffs have failed to meet their
burden of proof to establish fraud, inverse condemnation or
nuisance.  Plaintiffs have failed to establish any damages.
There is no established nexus between EMF exposure and any known
health hazard.  While a diminution in property value may be
expected from the proximity to EMF transmission lines, here
plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate any diminution in
value attributable specifically  to the fear of health hazards as
opposed to other of the known detriments.  Plaintiffs negotiated
and accepted a price for the easement which accurately reflected
the damage to their property."

     TANC is represented by Ivor E. Samson of Sonnenschein Nath &
Rosenthal and by Valerie Smith Boyd of Marron, Reid & Sheehy,
both of San Francisco.  The plaintiffs are represented by Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. and John J. Keating of the Law Office of John
Keating in Woodside, CA.

9TH CIR. DETERMINES HEALTH
ASSESSMENT TO CONSTITUTE
REMOVAL OR RESPONSE

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 affirmed a
Washington federal court's dismissal of a citizens' group's bid
to compel the Agency for Toxic Research and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) to initiate a health assessment program in the region of
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Hanford Downwinders Coalition
et al. v. Dowdle et al., No. 94-35100 (9th Cir.).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.)

     The panel agreed that no federal court jurisdiction existed
over the claim and concluded that the ATSDR's ongoing health
assessment activity in the region constituted a removal or
remedial action for the purposes of CERCLA's Timing of Review
provision.

     The litigation stems from ongoing cleanup efforts at the
Hanford facility in Richland, WA, which for some 30 years
produced plutonium for the Department of Defense.  The facility
generated releases of radioactive iodine and other hazardous
substances into the atmosphere, soil and water of the region.

     In 1988, the EPA proposed adding the Hanford site to the
National Priorities List (NPL).  The following year, the EPA,
Department of Energy and Washington Department of Ecology
outlined their response.  The ATSDR was assigned specific
responsibilities under the response plan to prepare preliminary
health assessments, and was given the discretion to expand them
to full health assessments if warranted.

     The Hanford site has remained the subject of continued
research by the ATSDR.  In 1993, the ATSDR declared the site to
be among the Superfund sites posing the greatest threat to public
health, and has applied the results of the Centers for Disease
Control's 1994 study to its criteria for determining whether
medical monitoring would be appropriate.

     Plaintiffs Hanford Downwinders Coalition Inc. (HDC) brought
the instant litigation in July 1993, alleging that the ATSDR has
a mandatory duty under CERCLA Sec. 9604(i)(9) to commence a
health surveillance program in the region, including medical
testing and monitoring for individuals exposed to radioactive
iodine.  The Eastern District of Washington granted the defense's
dismissal motion, concluding that the ATSDR's health-related
activities at Hanford constituted ongoing removal or response
activity, and that the plaintiffs' claim was therefore an
impermissible challenge.

     Affirming, the Ninth Circuit first rejected the plaintiffs'
contentions that the language of the statute supported their
construction of the statute.  The HDC asserted that when Congress
instructed the ATSDR to "effectuate and implement [CERCLA's]
health-related authorities" in Sec. 9604(i)(1) of the statute, it
meant to distinguish these health-related authorities from
"response authorities" as defined under Sec. 9604.  "There is no
indication that Congress' characterization of ATSDR authorities
as 'health related' was intended to render the Sec. 9604
'response authorities' section superfluous as to ATSDR actions,"
the panel rejoined.

     The panel found that the language of Sec. 9604(i)(1) "should
be read narrowly as a means to distinguish between different
types of response authorities, rather than interpreted broadly as
an effort to differentiate ATSDR health assessment and
surveillance activity from response actions protected by the
Timing of Review provision."

     Cautioning that not all Sec. 9604 "response authorities" are
to be considered removal or remedial actions per se, the Ninth
Circuit engaged in an analysis of whether the ATSDR's conduct
could be shown to be removal or remedial activity.  "The ATSDR
health assessment and surveillance activities challenged by the
HDC," the panel wrote, "are a necessary part of the government's
efforts to safeguard the public health at NPL sites....  [The
ATDSR] is an integral part of Congress' effort to protect the
health of those exposed to hazardous releases from facilities
listed on the NPL."

     The court reconciled the instant case with its holdings in
Durfey v. E.I. DuPont (1995) and Price v. U.S. Navy (1994), which
declared that independent private actions for medical monitoring
were not removal or remedial actions.  "The reasoning in Durfey
and Price does not apply to health assessment and surveillance
actions engaged in by a governmental agency pursuant to explicit
CERCLA provisions," wrote the panel.

     The plaintiffs pointed to the structure of CERCLA, noting
that Sec. 9607(a)(4)(A), which provides for the government to
recover "all costs of removal or remedial action," is separate
from Sec. 9607(a)(4)(D), which provides for the recovery of "the
costs of any health assessment" made by the ATSDR.  The panel
rejoined that Sec. 9607(a)(4)(D) was in fact part of the 1986
SARA amendments, and "decline[d] to read the failure of Congress
to accomplish the seamless integration of ATSDR provisions with
the other authorities found under subsection 9607(a)(4)(A) as
compelling proof of Congress' intent to distinguish ATSDR
activities from removal and remedial actions."

     The plaintiffs also pointed to the separate treatment of
response costs and ATSDR costs in CERCLA Sec. Sec. 9611(a) and
9611(c).  Noting the fact that the legislative history was silent
as to why the distinction was made, the panel stated its
obligation "to choose the interpretation that is most consistent
with the remainder of the Act."

     Having established that the ATSDR's conduct constituted
removal or remedial action, the Ninth Circuit disposed of HDC's
assertions that the requirements of the Timing of Review
provision were otherwise unsatisfied.  The panel looked to its
1995 holdings in MESS v. Perry and Razore v. Tulalip Tribes in
concluding that the HDC's suit was a "challenge" to the ongoing
removal or remediation.

     Tom H. Foulds, Seattle, represents the appellants.

     Elizabeth Ann Peterson of the U.S. Department of Justice,
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Washington, DC,
represents the appellees.

9TH CIR. ASKED TO DECIDE
NGA AND 'HINSHAW' STATUS
OF MOJAVE'S CA EXPANSION

     In an intervenor's brief filed Dec. 18, Process Gas
Consumers Group (PGCG) told the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals to reject the California Public Utilities Commission's
petition to vacate two Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
orders asserting regulatory authority over Mojave Pipeline Co.'s
planned 400-mile-plus "Northward Expansion" gas transmission line
from Sycamore, CA to the San Francisco Bay area.  Public
Utilities Commission of the State of California v. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, No. 95-70611 (9th Cir.); see related
story, Pacific Gas & Electric v. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, Utilities Industry LR, June 1995.

     PGCG sided with Mojave's Dec. 13 intervenor brief, which
urged the court to affirm FERC authority over the project based
on the FERC's finding that Mojave will neither be (1) engaged in
local gas distribution and subject to state jurisdiction under
Natural Gas Act (NGA) Sec. 717(b); nor (2) under PUC rule through
the NGA's "Hinshaw Amendment" exemption.

     In November, the PUC asked the Ninth Circuit to vacate the
FERC orders (No. 61,194, Feb. 15, 1994; No. 61,167, Aug. 4, 1995)
that rendered void a 1993 PUC order asserting PUC jurisdiction
over the high-pressure line.  The FERC said it holds authority
over the line because it is designed to provide direct
transportation-only service to end-users, not local distribution
retail sales.

     The PUC, however, says the project meets the criteria for
Hinshaw Amendment exemption from NGA rule, which are that,
"(1) the person or facilities must either transport or be legally
authorized to transport gas which is 'received by such person
from another person within or at the boundary of a State';
(2) 'all the natural gas so received [must be] consumed within
such State'; and (3) 'the rates and services of such person and
facilities [must] be subject to regulation by a State
commission.'"

     The PUC argued that "[i]f Mojave's Northward Expansion
application were granted, both Mojave " the 'person' " and the
'facilities' used by Mojave to transport gas received by Mojave
in California and ultimately consumed in California, would be
exempted from FERC jurisdiction by the plain language of the
Hinshaw Amendment.  The FERC is therefore, without jurisdiction
to grant the expansion certificate requested by Mojave.  Such a
certificate can only be granted by the PUC, which has certified
to the FERC that 'it has regulatory jurisdiction over the rates
and services of the Mojave Pipeline Co. and the facilities used
by Mojave to transport gas received by Mojave in California and
ultimately consumed in California and that it is exercising such
jurisdiction.'"

     On Nov. 14, a joint intervening brief was filed on the PUC's
behalf by Associated Gas Distributors (AGD), the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Toward Utility
Rate Normalization, a consumer action agency that says
residential and small business customers have experienced
significant rate hikes in recent years due to interstate pipeline
bypass.

     AGD and the joint intervenors say the record "amply
demonstrates that Mojave's Northward Expansion project will
engage in the local distribution of natural gas and is therefore
exempt from FERC regulation."  The FERC's assertion of authority,
they add, is "inconsistent with the statutory language,
legislative history, and case law of Sec. 1(b)."

     The PGCG added on the FERC's behalf, "The proposed
facilities are not Hinshaw facilities exempt from the NGA.
Mojave's pipeline crosses the Arizona-California border,
and...Mojave's integrated pipeline transports gas as part of a
continuous stream of interstate commerce.  The fact that some gas
might potentially also be received from Kern River [Gas
Transmission Co.] in California does not change the interstate
character of the transportation.  In order to qualify as a
Hinshaw pipeline, a pipeline must operate exclusively in one
state; Mojave does not.  The mere existence of an extension or
branch located within a state does not render an integrated
interstate pipeline company a Hinshaw pipeline.  Nor would
receipt of gas from another interstate pipeline within the state
alter the multi-state pipeline's interstate character."

     The PUC brief was filed by PUC attorneys Mark Fogelman,
Peter Arth Jr. and Edward W. O'Neill of San Francisco.  Mojave is
represented by corporate attorney Michael D. Ferguson of
Bakersfield, CA, and by Mary Anne Mason, Kenneth L. Wiseman, and
Kenneth M. Minesinger of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., in Washington,
DC.

     The AGD intervenor brief was filed by Frederick Moring and
Ann H. Kim of Crowell & Moring in Washington, DC.  PGCG is
represented by Edward J. Grenier Jr., William H. Penniman, Glen
S. Howard and Daniel E. Frank of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan.

CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT
AFFIRMS $1.3M WRONGFUL
DEMOTION AWARD

     A company that demoted two employees without following the
procedures outlined in its personnel manual was ordered to pay
$1.3 million in damages to those workers by the California
Supreme Court on Nov. 13.  Scott et al. v. Pacific Gas and
Electric, No. S042601 (CA Sup. Ct.); see Utilities Industry LR,
April 19, 1994.

     In a unanimous decision on an issue of first impression, the
court said that there was no reason why an employer's policy that
its employees not be demoted except for good cause could not
become an implied term of an employment contract.

     Plaintiffs C. Byron Scott and Al Johnson were engineers with
defendant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)'s technical and
ecological services unit when they were demoted in 1988.  Just
prior to the demotion, PG&E's internal auditing department began
an investigation into Scott's and Johnson's supervisory practices
and outside business interests.  According to court documents,
both men were partners in an outside consulting firm, and PG&E
had been informed of this involvement from the outset.

     As a result of the investigation, Scott and Johnson were
accused of being negligent supervisors and of resolving against
PG&E any conflicts of interest that arose from their dual
positions as proprietors of an outside business and employees of
PG&E.  They were suspended with only a brief explanation of the
charges against them and were denied copies of the report.  Their
response to the report was submitted in three days, and contained
extensive documentary support for their denials that they favored
vendors or employees of their outside business while employed by
PG&E.

     Scott and Johnson filed suit, claiming that PG&E breached an
implied contract term not to demote employees without good cause.
Their theory was based on the company's detailed personnel
policies, and there was evidence at trial that PG&E intended to
bind itself to those disciplinary policies.  There was also
testimony that neither Scott nor Johnson had shown any
favoritism.

     The jury found in favor of the employees and awarded them
$1.325 million in economic damages and $75,000 each for emotional
distress.  A divided state Court of Appeal reversed, finding a
contract action for "wrongful demotion" inherently vague.  The
court also concluded that judicial involvement in employment
decisions short of termination would constitute an unacceptable
intrusion into the employer-employee relationship.

     The California high court reversed, agreeing with the
plaintiffs' argument that their breach of an implied-in-fact
agreement with PG&E not to be demoted without good cause is
substantially similar to an action for breach of an implied-in-
fact contract not to be discharged without good cause.  The
latter cause of action was held to be enforceable in Foley v.
Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654 (1988), noted Justice
Stanley Mosk, who delivered the opinion of the court.

     The principle that implied contract terms may arise from an
employer's official and unofficial policies and practices is one
that pre-dates Foley, and has not been confined to the area of
wrongful termination, said Justice Mosk.  Where an employer
promises to confer a significant benefit on an employee " such as
a promise to restrict termination or provide for severance pay "
it is a question of fact whether that promise was reasonably
understood by the employee to create a contractual obligation,
said the court.  Here the jury resolved that issue in favor of
Scott and Johnson.

     Turning to the evidence of an implied contract adduced in
the instant case, Justice Mosk concluded that that evidence was
"not merely substantial, but compelling."  He cited the company
detailed "positive discipline" and testimony from PG&E's own
human resources managers to support the jury's conclusion that
there was an implied contract, and that its terms were not too
vague to enforce.

     Scott and Johnson are represented by Christopher Platten of
Wylie, McBride, Jesinger, Sure & Platten in San Jose.  Counsel
for PG&E is corporate attorney Maureen Fries in San Francisco.

PLAINTIFF IN ILL HEALTH
SEEKS EXPEDITED APPEAL
OF CA DEFENSE VERDICT

     The plaintiff in a personal injury suit against the owners
and operators of the St. Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
(SONGS) will petition the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
this week for an expedited appeal of a jury verdict in favor of
the defense after losing a bid for a retrial on Dec. 5, according
to his attorney, Don Howarth.   James v. Southern California
Edison Co., No. 94-1085 (SD CA).

     Howarth filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 22.  He said that
his client, Glen James, 63, who is suffering from chronic
myelogenous leukemia, is in rapidly deteriorating health and that
he wants to expedite the appeal on James' behalf "while it may
still do him some good."  James, an engineer, worked at SONGS in
the mid-1980s.

     Howarth moved for a new trial after the eight-person jury
returned a verdict in favor of defendants Southern California
Edison and Combustion Engineering Inc. on Oct. 12.  He argued
that the jury was improperly influenced by the O.J. Simpson trial
and by juror misconduct.

     Howarth argued that the verdict was against the weight of
the evidence, that it was the product of improper passion and
prejudice and that the jury improperly considered extraneous,
prejudicial information.

     According to the motion, one of the jurors, Genevieve
Fitzwater, told the others that she had received radiation
therapy for thyroid cancer and that "it had saved my life."  In
addition, after the jurors were allowed to watch the verdict in
the O.J. Simpson case, Fitzwater also allegedly told the others
that they must apply the same "reasonable doubt" standard used in
the Simpson murder case to the evidence in this case.

     James also alleged that a second juror told a post-verdict
gathering that he had made his mind up for the defense early in
the trial before all of the evidence had been presented and that
he had never wavered in his belief.

     Southern District of California Judge Napoleon Jones Jr.
rejected all of those arguments, finding that under the Federal
Rules of Evidence, most of juror Gregory Hafen's declaration
supporting the allegations of juror misconduct is inadmissible.

     According to Rule 606(b), a juror may not testify to
anything that may have influenced his decision during
deliberations except on the question of whether extraneous
prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's
attention.

     Under that rule, only Fitzwater's statements about her
radiation treatment and applying the reasonable doubt standard
may be admissible if they can be shown to be extraneous
information and prejudicial by a preponderance of the evidence,
Judge Jones said.

     He ruled, however, that Fitzwater's alleged statements about
her radiation treatment are not prejudicial extraneous
information but "are best classified as personal experience
applied to the evidence in the case...."

     Citing to Hard v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 870 F.2d
61 (9th Cir. 1989), Judge Jones said, "The type of after-acquired
information that potentially taints a jury verdict should be
carefully distinguished from the general knowledge, opinions,
feelings and bias that every juror carries into the jury room."

     In Hard, he said, the Ninth Circuit found that it is
acceptable for a juror to use his own personal experience to
interpret the evidence in a case.  In addition, even if
Fitzwater's statements did constitute impermissible extraneous
information, the plaintiff failed to show prejudice by a
preponderance of the evidence.

     On the reasonable doubt issue, Judge Jones found that such
allegations are not admissible because they constitute testimony
on the mental processes of the jury.  He found no Ninth Circuit
precedence on the issue, but he cited two Fifth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals cases that hold that once a verdict is rendered,
the court may not inquire into the jury's deliberative process to
determine if the jury properly followed the court's instructions
(United States v. D'Angelo, 598 F.2d 1002 [1979] and Robles v.
Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d 1201 [1989]).

     In addition to Howarth, the Jameses are represented by
Suzelle M. Smith of Howarth & Smith in Los Angeles.  Southern
California Edison is represented by Jack Reding of Crosby,

CA SUP. CT. TO DECIDE
MOBILE HOME SUBMETER
SYSTEMS RATE DISPUTE

     A consortium of California mobilehome park owners on Sept.
12 asked the California Supreme Court to decide if the state
Public Utilities Commission misinterpreted the public utilities
code in barring park owners from recovering the unreimbursed
costs of operating their submeter utility systems.  Western
Mobilehome Parkowners Association et al. v. Public Utilities
Commission of the State of California, No. S048893 (CA Sup. Ct.).

     Western Mobilehome Parkowners Association (WMA) sought the
court's review after the PUC refused WMA's motion to rehear the
issue in August (Decision Nos. 95-02-090 and 95-08-056).  The
group, whose members operate 5,780 master-meter/submeter electric
and gas distribution systems, says they have been disadvantaged
by the PUC's refusal to let them recover, via rent increases,
system operation costs above the discounted rate provided by
their local utility.

     WMA says that since Public Utility Code Sec. 739.5(a) does
not expressly prohibit parkowners from recovering unreimbursed
costs, the PUC has overstepped its authority and has illegally
engaged in rent control by forcing them to make up the difference
out of their pockets.  The PUC issued the ruling after mobilehome
park residents complained they were, in some cases, being double-
billed for park system maintenance costs, once in the rates they
paid and again in landlord-imposed rent increases.

     The Supreme Court petition maintains that since the
implementation of Sec. 729.5(a), the submetering discount
provided parkowners "has been set based on utility comparable
costs which have been determined to be substantially lower than
the reasonable costs of master-metered mobilehome park owners of
providing submetered service."  It adds that "the PSC in D.95-02-
090 has now decided that as between owners of mobilehome parks
and residents in mobilehome parks, mobilehome park owners must
underwrite all those reimbursed costs, that is losses incurred in
owning, operating and maintaining submetered systems, WITHOUT ANY
RECOURSE."

     In an Oct. 16 answering brief, the PUC says the issue was
appropriately decided because Sec. 739.5 bars subsystem operators
from recovery of costs above the submetering discount.  The PUC
says the legislative intent of the section was not to allow full
compensation for subsystem operations, but to give a "sufficient
differential to cover the reasonable average costs to master-
meter customers of providing submeter service."

     "Moreover," the PUC added, "the regulation may serve a
legitimate public purpose in preventing the potential for the
double recovery of costs by park owner.  The double recovery may
exist if the leases provide for rents that include the capital
costs related to the submetered system, and these same costs are
factored into the discount received by the park owner, and the
tenants do not receive a credit.  Thus, this double recovery
would be a windfall for the park owner.  The elimination of such
a windfall is a legitimate public interest."

     WMA is represented by Richard L. Hamilton and James E. Young
of the Law Office of Richard L. Hamilton in Sacramento.  The
answer was filed by PUC attorneys Peter Arth Jr. and Helen W. Yee
of San Francisco.

DC CIR. REVERSES FERC'S
APPROVAL OF 'BLENDED RATE'
FOR MICHCON GAS SERVICE

     Siding with an ANR Pipeline Co. petition that alleged the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission arbitrarily and capriciously
allowed Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. (MichCon) to employ a
"blended rate" schedule for natural gas transport services, the
District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 12
reversed the FERC ruling and remanded it for further review.  ANR
Pipeline Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, No. 94-1705
(DC Cir.).

     ANR asked the court to review the FERC's decision,
complaining that it violated the Commission's own anti-rate
blending edict in Order No. 636.  In that order, the FERC
mandated use of a straight fixed-variable (SFV) rate plan for
intrastate or "Hinshaw" pipelines operating in cooperation with
interstate lines under Sec. 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of
1978 (NGPA).

     The panel noted that ANR opposed MichCon's use of blended
rates as an intervenor in FERC proceedings and that the
Commission approved the rate plan despite ANR's insistence that
the approach would provide MichCon the anticompetitive ability to
provide a discount in its rates under Michigan law, which is
unavailable to federally ruled interstate lines.

     "The reasons given by FERC fail to explain why MichCon's
blended rates would not present the ills that FERC concluded in
Order No. 636 would result from continued authority to blend
rates," said the DC Circuit in an opinion written by Judge Judith
W. Rogers.  On remand, said the panel, the FERC must address
ANR's concerns about MichCon's use of blended rates and
"...provide a reasonable justification for excluding MichCon from
the SFV requirements, in view of FERC's conclusions about rate
blending and about the necessity of the SFV rate method to
promoting congressional directives for a natural gas market."

     The court added that the FERC "missed the point" when it
answered ANR's rate-blending concerns by holding that ANR and
other interstate pipelines can remain competitive by discounting
their rates.  "A pipeline that cannot blend rates is unable to
recover fixed costs foregone as a result of discounting its

CA SUP. CT. ASKED TO
REVIEW REQUEST FOR
GAS CONTRACT DATA

     The California Supreme Court has been asked by two utility
consortiums to issue a writ of mandate compelling the state
Public Utilities Commission to open its files on four Southern
California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) natural gas transmission contracts
for inspection under the provisions of the California Public
Records Act.  Southern California Utility Power Pool et al. v.
Public Utilities Commission of the State of California; Southern
California Gas Co., real party in interest, No. S049667 (CA
Sup. Ct.).
               Southern California Utility Power Pool (SCUPP) and Imperial
Irrigation District (IID) comprise publicly owned utilities that
say the PUC violated the public access provision of Sec. 6250-65
when it denied their access requests as contrary to the public
interest.  The PUC conceded that while California Public Utility
Code Sec. 489 charges utilities with the responsibility of filing
and keeping "open to public inspection," rate schedules and
contracts that affect rates, SCUPP and IID, as potential SoCalGas
competitors, are not entitled to view the unredacted contracts.

     Allowing the petitioners access to the proprietary
information on rates charged by SoCalGas under the agreements,
said the PUC, would be unfair because neither SCUPP nor IID are
under PUC regulation, thus denying SoCalGas any opportunity of
requesting inspection of their transmission agreements.  Each of
the pacts at issue was approved under the PUC's "Expedited
Application Docket" (EAD) process, which allows transmission
companies to provide discounts for customers threatening to
"bypass" the utility for another power source.

     The PUC's reciprocity argument, says SCUPP/IID, is
"misplaced" because "neither the members of SCUPP nor IID compete
with SoCalGas to provide gas transmission service.  They operate
publicly owned electric utility systems that consume gas to
generate electricity for their retail electric customers."  SCUPP
includes the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the
cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena.

     The petitioners told the Supreme Court that the PUC denied
the request despite the fact that it knew the contracts were not
eligible for exemption from public inspection under the Act.
"For an agency to properly apply the law that it is empowered to
enforce, it must first look to the language of the statute to
determine if it is clear.  If the language is clear, the agency
must apply that language," argued SCUPP and IID.  "It is not
within the discretion of the agency to rewrite the provisions of
the relevant statute to fit its goals.  Any actions that are
inconsistent with the clear pronouncement of the legislature must
be overturned."

     In a Dec. 1 answer, the PUC said its actions were warranted
under Public Records Act Sec. 6255, which holds that "the agency
shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the
record in question is exempt under express provisions of this
chapter or that on the facts of the particular case the public
interest served by not making the record public clearly outweighs
the public interest served by disclosure of the record."

     The PUC contended that "SCUPP/IID can ignore Commission
orders to disclose records while demanding (as it does here) that
the Commission order SoCalGas to disclose the very same type of
document.  The legislature did not intend to create unfair
competition.  That is exactly what will happen under SCUPP/IID's
version of the law in this case in that SoCalGas would be placed
in an unfair competitive position in negotiations with SCUPP/IID
and other entities if disclosure of its similar gas contracts is
required.  On these facts, the conclusion that non-disclosure
outweighs disclosure was lawful."

     On Nov. 21, SoCalGas, as real party in interest, filed a
Supreme Court brief opposing the writ petition.  It said the PUC
properly based its denial of the contract access requests on the
increasingly competitive California natural gas market.  "The
Commission's EAD decision noted that in light of the imminent
threat of bypass of historic public utility facilities (two major
new interstate pipelines have commenced service in California
since 1990, providing service to customers previously served by
SoCalGas), the Commission determined to prevent public disclosure
of the information in arrangements which could be detrimental to
the competitive position of the public utility company and its
remaining ratepayers during the period such bypass threats
continue.

     SoCalGas says the Records Act, based on the federal Freedom
of Information Act, "was enacted with the clear intent to exempt
from disclosure those documents on file with the government
which, if made available, would result in business disadvantage
to a company vis-a-vis its competition."  SCUPP and IID's
discussion of the Act, it adds, "fails to comment specifically on
the long-standing exception to disclosure for BOTH corporate
trade secrets and commercial information likely to cause
competitive harm."

     The petitioners are represented by Norman A. Pederson and
Kirstin Porter-Whitley of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Los
Angeles.  The PUC is represented by agency attorneys Peter Arth
Jr., William N. Foley and Lawrence Q. Garcia of San Francisco.
The SoCalGas response was filed by corporate attorneys Daniel G.
Clement and Norman J. Provost.  All are located in Los Angeles.

NC COURT OF APPEALS
DENIES EASEMENT FOR
UTILITY INSTALLATION

     An easement that does not expressly permit access for
utilities cannot be judicially expanded to authorize installation
of underground utility and telephone lines, the North Carolina
Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 21 in a 2-1 decision.  Swaim v.
Simpson et al., No. COA94-1205 (NC Ct. App.).

     The majority said the easement holder is bound by the
express and limited language of the conveyance.

     Rickey Swaim was granted a recorded easement to his
residential lot for a "right of way for ingress and egress" over
a lot owned by Elmer and Joan Simpson in Yadkin County, NC.
After the Simpsons refused him permission to install underground
utility and phone lines along the easement, Swaim filed a
declaratory judgment complaint in Yadkin County District Court,
where Judge Samuel L. Osborne granted summary judgment in favor
of Swaim.

     The Court of Appeals reversed in a majority opinion by Chief
Judge Gerald Arnold.  Once an easement is established, the
easement holder cannot change the use for which it was created in
a way that increases the burden on the subservient land, said the
panel.  Allowing the location, installation and maintenance of
facilities for domestic utilities on the Simpsons' property would
increase that burden, it said, and the easement cannot be
judicially expanded.

     Dissenting, Judge Clifton E. Johnson said Swaim's
underground utilities would not encumber the Simpsons' property
or use of the easement.  He also said it is reasonable to
interpret the easement language as including the right to install
utilities to a residential lot.

     C.R. "Skip" Long Jr. of Morrow, Alexander, Tash & Long
represented the Simpsons.  N. Lawrence Hudspeth III and Douglas
P. Mayo of Shore Hudspeth & Harding appeared for Swaim.
