<h1>Hello and welcome to the website!</h1><h5><a href="contents.html">Go straight to &quotContents at a Glance&quot</h5></a>
<P>If you're interested in issues such as euthanasia, living wills and dying with dignity,
we hope you'll find much here to interest you and possibly be of use.</p>

<p>The information in these pages is continually being updated and expanded, so you
may wish to visit more than once - even if only to get the latest news.</p>
<P>Could we suggest that you add
a page as a bookmark now? The two best pages for fast access to all information are
this page (http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/tour.html) or the "FastAccess Page".

<P>with the same corresponding functions to get about the VESS website:</p>

<li><A HREF="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/index.html"><IMG SRC="home.gif" height=27> [VESS Homepage] </a> or "Home"
is a large file containing many of the basics, if you are new to the subject, and valuable reference material
if you are already a &quotright to die veteran&quot.</p>
<P>It's told from a Scottish perspective, with more reference to UK and Scottish material than, say, an American site. 
In the Homepage, after our mission statement and a history of how we got where we are, there's
brief acounts of major figures: Bland, Cox, Rodriguez, the prisoner known as &quot C &quot, Quinlan, Sanpedro,
Cruzan, Malette and Conroy. Then sections on Living Wills and Self-Deliverance, and a
Bibliography of books we recommend. There's a short section on the books we ourselves can supply, and some
<em>links</em> to other sites on Death and Dying. The most important is an enormous site called DeathNET which provides an excellent international News Service (to explore DeathNET, click on &quotWorld News&quot in Fast Access and then go to the DeathNET &quotFront End&quot.)</p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<li><A HREF="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/new_app.html">
<IMG SRC="subscribe.gif" height=27> [Subscribe] </a>
 We find we have members from all over the world -
not just Scotland and England - and including establishments such as nursing schools. Many join to receive our Newsletter, or to become eligible to receive our booklet &quotDeparting Drugs&quot. This button gives you all the details and an application form should you wish to become a member.
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<li><A HREF="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/a_z.html">
<IMG SRC="index.gif" height=27> [A-Z] </a>
 The A-Z acts as both index and glossary. Select a letter and find the section you want. Follow the links for more information. Suggestions for inclusion? Drop us an email or use the Feedback form.
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<li><A HREF="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/index.html#books"><IMG SRC="library.gif" height=27> [Books] </a> Takes you straight to the details of publications available from VESS.
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<li><A HREF="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/feedback.html"><IMG SRC="comments.gif" height=27"> [Feedback] </a>Can't find what you need? Send us an email explaining what you're looking for - we'll do our best to help. Ideas for inclusion? Let us know. Maybe you're more experienced than we are at creating web pages - let us have your tips! We put them together in our spare time so there's probably many things that could be improved! We don't get time to check and proof-read everything as much as we'd like, so even typos or faulty links are worth bringing to our attention.</p>
<P>The VESS Website will run best using Netscape, but you should be able to get everything you need with other browsers - please let us know if there's a problem.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

<li><A HREF="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/fastaccs.html"><IMG SRC="fasticon.gif" height=27>[FastAccess] </a> This is a fast-loading front menu. I wrote it after using the Internet for a few months to get euthanasia-related info and tried to put links to everything I needed on one screen. If this page <em>doesn't</em> get you to where you want to go most of the time I'd be surprised. Why this one and not the homepage? Well, the homepage is <em>rather big</em>: the advantage is that you can search through it or print the whole thing out and use it as a reference book, but it consequently takes longer to get on screen.</p>
<p>Here's the FastAccess screen with some extra details (exact contents will vary from time to time):
