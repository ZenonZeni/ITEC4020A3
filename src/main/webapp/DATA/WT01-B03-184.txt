         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>People remain any company's
         single most important asset. SuperGen has built a lean team
         of highly accomplished and motivated people -- mostly at the
         senior level and many of whom have worked together as teams
         for years at other successful pharmaceutical companies. For
         example, the company's Development and Registration
         function, located in a separate facility near Chicago,
         includes six Ph.D. level members, who collectively have been
         responsible for nearly 200 New Drug Applications to the U.S.
         Food and Drug Administration. The team, as well as the
         company's entrepreneurial corporate culture, are an
         extension of the vision and strategy of SuperGen's founder
         Dr. Joseph Rubinfeld. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

         Ph.D.,</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=4> co-founded the Company in
         1991. He has served as Chief Executive Officer, President,
         Chief Scientific Officer and a director of the Company since
         its inception. Dr. Rubinfeld was one of the four initial
         founders of Amgen in 1980 and served as Vice President and
         Chief of Operations until 1983. Prior to Amgen, Dr.
         Rubinfeld was employed at Bristol-Myers Squibb (formerly
         Bristol-Myers International Corporation) in a variety of
         positions, most recently as Vice President and Director of
         Research and Development. While at Bristol-Myers, Dr.
         Rubinfeld was instrumental in licensing the original
         anticancer line of products for Bristol-Myers, including
         Mitomycin and Bleomycin. From 1987 to 1990, he was a Senior
         Director at Cetus Corporation. Dr. Rubinfeld also has been a
         research scientist with several pharmaceutical and consumer
         product companies including Schering-Plough Corporation and
         Colgate-Palmolive Co. He received his B.S. in chemistry from
         C.C.N.Y., and his M.A. and Ph.D. in chemistry from Columbia
         University.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Dr. Rubinfeld has numerous patents and/or
         publications on a wide range of inventions and developments
         including the 10-second developer for Polaroid film,
         manufacture of cephalosporins (the next generation of
         antibiotics following penicillin) and the first commercial
         synthetic biodegradable detergent. In 1984 Dr. Rubinfeld
         received the Commonwealth Award for Invention. </FONT>
