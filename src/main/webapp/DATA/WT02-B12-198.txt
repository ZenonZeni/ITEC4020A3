<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Hispanic population in the South

grew from 4.3 million to 6.5 million between 1980 and 1990.  The

rising number of Hispanics is changing &quot;minority relations&quot;

in the southeast, traditionally viewed in terms of Black and white.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In the 1990 Census, the 66,000 Hispanics

were one percent of the state's 6.6 million residents.  Today,

there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 Hispanics in North Carolina,

many attracted from Texas by wages of $6 to $7 instead of $4.25.

 In many cases, Hispanics are replacing Blacks in construction,

services and manufacturing.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Most studies trace the upsurge in Hispanic

workers to the recruitment of Latino tobacco workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">On August 8, 1996, some 450 Guatemalan

and Mexican immigrant workers called an unfair labor practice

strike against Case Farms poultry processing plant in Morgantown,

North Carolina.  On July 12, 1995, Case Farms workers voted 238

to 183 to be represented by the Laborers' International Union

of North America (LIUNA), a union with 750,000 members in construction,

building maintenance, food service, health care and clerical occupations.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">According to the union, Case fired 38

workers for union activity since the July 1995 election.  The

NLRB ordered Case to begin to bargain with LIUNA on March 7, 1996.

 Case appealed.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The INS detained 124 of the 1,200 workers

at two plants of poultry processor Allen Family Foods in Cordova

and Hurlock, Maryland, in late August.  Eight poultry processing

firms employ 14,000 workers in the Delmarva area, including 3200

Hispanics.  Most workers begin at $6 per hour, rising to a maximum

of $7 per hour.  Turnover is high; for every 100 jobs, 180 to

200 workers are hired each year.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Allen Family Foods paid a $43,000 INS

fine in 1994 for knowingly hiring illegal aliens and for failing

to have I-9 forms.  The INS is investigating whether plant supervisors

participated in a smuggling ring based in Marydel, a trailer park.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Baltimore Sun, in a major report

on October 13, 1996, noted that the 1990 Census reported 7,000

Hispanics on Maryland's Eastern Shore and Delaware's Kent and

Sussex counties, and 9000 in 1994.  Some mid-1960s estimates are

that there are 20,000 Hispanics in southern Delaware and 7,000

on the Maryland Shore.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">There are 3000 migrant farm workers in

Delmarva, and 400 children enrolled in Migrant Education program

each summer.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Hispanic immigrants include a significant

number of Guatemalans--$300,000 is reportedly sent each month

from Georgetown to Guatemala.&quot;</FONT></TT>
