Investing">
<BR>


Some of the best things you can do for yourself - eating vegetables,
flossing your teeth and investing regularly - are the most difficult
habits to develop. None provides immediate gratification, and some are
downright disagreeable. There's no sugar surge from vegetables. Flossing
can be irritating. And when you invest a portion of your income, that
money is not available for you to spend. What, then, is the incentive to
adopt these good habits? 
<BR><BR>

The payback for a lifetime of eating peas (and Brussels sprouts and
asparagus and broccoli) is good health. Wedging that floss in and out of
your teeth can spare you the expense and discomfort of repeated
visits to the dentist. And people who invest regularly find their
motivation by in the potential for positive long-term results.
Although you can be given no guarantees, the decision to adopt a regular
investment plan can be the beginning of yet another habit that can be
good for you. 
<BR><BR>

Where do your investment dollars come from? Really, there are only two
possibilities. 
<BR><BR>

You might have a sizable amount of money (which we'll call a lump sum)
that you want to put to work toward a short-term goal, such as the
purchase of a home, or a long-term goal, such as your retirement. Lump
sums can drop into your lap for any number of reasons - possibly you
have earned a bonus, received an inheritance or settled an insurance
claim. No matter how it gets there, a lump sum distribution is an
occasion that requires an investment decision.
<BR><BR>

But lump sum payments are infrequent occurrences. If you're like most
people, any money that you have to invest must come from your current
income. You may use your income for other obligations and expenses, but
if you're going to invest for your future, you're going to have do so
out of today's income. Here's where you need discipline to develop the good
habit to invest regularly. 
<BR><BR>

It's the enviable person who can sit down, pay his bills, buy what he
wants and still have money left. It's the admirable person who follows
through by taking the money that's left and investing it. It's the rare
person, indeed, who follows this regime every pay period. 
<BR><BR>

The rest of us need the discipline of an automatic investment program.
Simply, an automatic investment program requires you to make the
decision to invest once. Once you've decided that you want to start
investing now - as opposed to waiting for that day some point in the
future when you get your lump sum - the automatic investment program can
take care of the rest. 
<BR><BR>

Where does your income come from? Whether it's from a paycheck, a
government payment or a bank account, you can establish a regular
program that will directly and automatically transfer a certain amount
into a mutual fund account. All you need to do is provide instructions
about how much should be moved and into which fund account on what date.
<BR><BR>

A program of automatic investing is easy to initiate, and this good
habit can start with a relatively small sacrifice on your part. (At
Kemper, the minimum monthly investment is $50.) 
<BR><BR>

In addition, a regular plan helps you develop a certain nonchalance.
Once you've arranged to invest a fixed amount every paycheck or every
month, you don't need to worry whether it's a "good" or "bad" time to be
making an investment. When prices are high, your fixed investment will
buy fewer shares of your fund than when prices are low. Of course, when
the price of your fund shares is low, you'll be able to accumulate more
shares. Market fluctuations shouldn't concern a regular investor with a
long-term investment horizon.
<BR><BR>

You should realize, however, that an automatic investment program cannot
assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Since
this type of program involves continuous investment regardless of
fluctuating share values, you'll need to consider your financial ability
to continue the program through periods of low price levels.

<BR>
 As a Kemper shareholder, you have your choice of three <A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">
 automatic investment programs.</A>* All are free of charge.
<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI> You can arrange to have all or a portion of your paycheck invested
directly into a Kemper fund.
<LI> You can automatically invest directly from your checking account.
Just
select the day each month that your money should be transferred to your
mutual fund account from your checking or savings account at any bank,
savings institution or credit union.**
<LI> If you receive Social Security checks or other regular payments
from
the U.S. government or any of its agencies, you can automatically invest
all or a portion of your government check directly into a 	Kemper fund.
<BR><BR>
</UL>

*Investments may be subject to a sales charge. Please consult your
prospectus for additional information.
<BR>
**In order for you to establish a Bank Direct Deposit plan, your
financial institution must be a member of the Automated Clearing House
Association. Note that mutual fund shares are not insured or guaranteed
as bank products are, and mutual funds present a greater risk to
capital.
