<hr><br><br>


<img src="a.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A"> crowd had gathered outside 35 Le Loi Street on May 22. Standing behind a red ribbon, they peered at new bicycles through a window festooned with yellow, pink and white balloons. Inside, Nguyen Thanh Liem prepared for a press conference.<p>

<img src="luax.gif" valign=top align=right alt="photo of Mr. Luax Xuan Thi">Mr. Liem is the director of the Bicycle Motorbike & Engine Company (BMEC), a state-owned enterprise created from the merger of the Union of Motorcycle and Bicycle Manufacturers (UMB) and the UMB's Spare Part Factory No. 3. Tall, gregarious and English-speaking, Mr. Liem welcomed his guests, including the previous directors of the UMB, then spoke and posed for photos.<p>

After the conference, Mr. Liem's prospective customers swarmed into the showroom. "Saigon" model bicycles covered the floor. Some with gears (a relatively new feature for Vietnamese bikes), some with pant guards and carrying racks (much more common features), these bikes ranged in price from $60-$110. Lining the walls were displays of accessories and parts, everything from bike frames to water bottles.<p>

<font size=+2>When Thi met Liem</font><p>

<img src="a.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">lso attending the opening of BMEC's bicycle showroom was Luan Xuan Thi, currently the leading Vietnamese bicycle manufacturer in HCMC. Mr. Thi began as a producer of spare parts in 1982. He expanded operations with a $500 investment in 1988. That year he made his first Martin 107, a bicycle named after a Catholic saint and Mr. Thi's street address. From five per day, he has increased his production rate to 50,000 per year.<p>

The only competition Mr. Thi originally faced came from the pervasive Chinese imports and the domestic knock-offs of his own designs. According to Mr. Thi, the Chinese bikes offered quality and low price, but no style; the knock-offs provided lower prices, but bad quality and cheap looks. Martin 107s combined high quality, using imported Chinese components, and modern, nearly neon, colors. Also attractive to customers was an installment plan Mr. Thi set up to offset the price difference between Chinese bikes and his own. A typical Martin 107 costs between $50-$70, while a Chinese bike can cost below $40.<p>

Unassuming and shy, Mr. Thi is nonetheless well-known in HCMC. While not Catholic, he admires -- and apparently emulates -- St. Martin's work with children and the poor. Since 1988 he has given away more than 1,000 bikes. He also admits that the foreign name is good for marketing.<p>

Will his good reputation help maintain market share against increased competition? As the event on May 22 indicates, BMEC has aggressively entered the bicycle market. BMEC director Liem, who met Mr. Thi for the first time at the showroom opening, has renovated his company with new designs, new machinery, and a new image.<p>

<font size=+2>Study in Contrasts</font><p>

<img src="t.gif" align=left border=0 alt="T">he day after the showroom opening, Mr. Liem flew to Nha Trang to spend two weeks searching for bicycle-shop opportunities along Vietnam's central coast. Aside from the contrasting personalities of the two companies' directors, this is another difference: Martin 107s are sold through a HCMC-based network of some two dozen shops (five of which are Martin 107-owned), which means farmers and other provincial customers desiring them must come to the city; BMEC appears to be reaching out to the various rural centers in Vietnam.<p>

With greater capital BMEC is gaining other potential advantages. Mr. Liem combats a low-quality image by using almost 60% imported parts, mostly from China, but increasingly from Taiwan, Japan, France, and India. Additionally, he has installed new machinery BMEC's three factories, the largest in HCMC. Mr. Liem characterizes the equipment of bicycle factories in the North (a photo of one appears in the Rick Smolan book Passage to Vietnam) as "backwards." Altogether, the three BMEC factories employ over 1,000 workers.<p>

While total projected annual production of the two companies is the same (50,000 units), Martin 107 is more at the level of "household enterprise" than BMEC. Against Mr. Liem's three factories, Mr. Thi has ten. Seven of them manufacture tires, frames, spokes, and mudguards; the other parts come from China. The three remaining factories are assembly plants that produce between 50-70 bikes per day.<p>

One such "plant" occupies what was once the backyard of a French colonial-era house. Rented from the government, the land has been fenced-in and laid with cement. Under a plastic roof, ten workers assemble the colorful bikes, lined up on their backs, 20-25 in two rows. Each worker has his own job: inserting spokes, attaching tires, installing brakes, connecting the pedals, etc. The only mechanical tools are a welder and mud-guard cutter.<p>

<img src="bikes.gif" valign=top align=left alt="photo of bike shop"><font size=+2>Foreign Investment?</font><p>

<img src="w.gif" align=left border=0 alt="W">ith several hundred thousand bicycles selling annually in Vietnam, why have foreign investors been relatively cool to this market? After all, the hyped-up automobile and motorbike market touches only 1-2% of the population; bicycles are in demand by some 80%.<p>

Mr. Thi has met with over 20 foreign companies, including the French automobile (and bicycle) manufacturer Peugeot and the Japanese trading giant Sumitomo; he maintains that they lost interest after discovering how little capital he held. He can apparently produce a high-quality bike at a per-unit cost significantly lower than could a foreign, or even a joint-venture operation.<p>

Using Vietnam as a platform for re-export, however, may be a more viable, though potentially more controversial, option for the foreign investor. At least one Chinese "screw-driver" assembly plant in a HCMC Export Zone has reportedly raised the attention of European anti-dumping watchdogs.<p>

Other obstacles include potential patent infringement. Much like computer software pirates, the Vietnamese "knock-off" artists are known to copy a new bike design within a week. A life-long bike enthusiast, Mr. Thi has made several innovations, such as wrap-around chain guards and screw covers, that quickly found other ways onto the street.<p>

Foreign bike manufacturers also have products which do not meet the demands of Vietnamese bike riders. Road bikes and mountain bikes do not accommodate the traditional ao dai uniform of high school girls, nor are they comfortable to ride in formal work clothes. The current design, which resembles the French bicycle of the 1950s, allows for wearing any style of dress as well as for carrying more than one person. As the most common mode of transportation, the bicycle -- xe dap -- often doubles as the family station wagon with seat attachments for toddlers and cushioned seats on the rear wheel for extra passengers or groceries. Sometimes it even serves as a pick-up truck, hauling produce or livestock from farm to market.<p>

<font size=+2>Leisure Sports</font><p>

<img src="h.gif" align=left border=0 alt="H">owever, there is an emerging market for mountain bikes and 10-speed touring bikes. Only in the last two years have mountain bikes, imported from China, hit the market and introduced a new niche to the bike industry: leisure sport and status symbols.<p>

The Shimakichi Bike Shop, which opened four months ago, is anticipating the growth of the leisure market. The shop specializes in high-end Japanese mountain bikes and French Peugeot road bikes. The average sticker price in the shop is between $170-$450. Consumers include wealthy Vietnamese who buy them for their children and foreigners looking for more familiar sets of wheels. Although not always practical in street traffic, these new, 100% foreign-made bikes are the latest status symbol for the status-conscious Vietnamese consumer.<p>

Of course, for those not able to afford a $400 bike, the Chinese alternative -- which is likely to have slipped around Vietnamese customs -- is available for one quarter that price.<p>

As Vietnamese income rises, so does desire for leisure activities, a demand now met by such novelties as the Superbowl bowling alley and the Saigon Waterpark. Similarly, developers are likely to find ways to cater to a growing demand for safe but fast bike paths.<p>

<font size=+2>Projections</font><p>

<img src="w.gif" align=left border=0 alt="W">hether domestic bike manufacturers will add mountain or touring bikes to their own product lines is another question. Given his low-tech assembly plants and limited capital, Mr. Thi is unlikely to move Martin 107 toward that higher-end any time soon. With more modern equipment and easier access to capital, Mr. Liem may be better positioned to do so; but is that BMEC's strategy? Walking by the BMEC showroom three weeks after its opening, one could see a display case that now curiously held, not bike gear, but dolls and other children's toys.<p>

Uneven or untried marketing aside, these two companies stand ready to compete for traditional Vietnamese bike buyers. Elsewhere in the Vietnamese economy, state-owned enterprises are growing at a faster rate than their non-state counterparts. That trend could hold for this industry, as well, but it remains too early to tell.
