<p><strong>Public Education is a Pillar of Democracy and Equality</strong></p>

<p>In announcing today, The Emergency Conference to Save Public Education
sponsored by the Communist Party, USA, Gus Hall, National Chairman said:
"Public education is a pillar of democracy and equality. The fight for it has
deep, anti-racist and democratic roots in our country." Hall went on: "Bob
Dole's acceptance speech singled out the teachers' unions for special attack
and said that he is a firm supporter of school choice and vouchers."
</p><p>
Hall characterized the attack, along with Dole's tax cut for the rich and the
corporations as "a new and dangerous element to the campaign of the
ultra-right" to completely dismantle the public education system in our
country. He warned "Don't forget: Gingrich tried to do away with the
Department of Education."
</p><p>
"The corporations and the ultra-right have pushed for defunding,
privatization, vouchers and every other scheme to eliminate what the majority
of Americans see as a basic right, free, integrated, quality public
education." Hall continued: "Unity of all -  with teachers, parents, students
and school workers - unity - between Black, brown, red and white - unity with
the labor movement and community is key to defeating the Dole, Gingrich,
Kemp, corporate attack."
</p><p>
The conference will be held September 21 in New York City. It will bring
together teachers, other school workers, parents, students, professors and
all grassroots trade unionists and activists concerned about public schools
and universities. A comprehensive program of action will be drafted. For more
information call (212) 989-4994.
