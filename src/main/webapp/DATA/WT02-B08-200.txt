about 15,000 m³/s was flowing down this part of the alluvial

<B>The Science Institute, University of Iceland, reported the 
jökulhlaup, hour by hour: </B><BR>
<BR>
November 5 - 09:00 GMT<BR>
<BR>
The jökulhlaup from Grímsvötn has just begun. The volume of the Skeiðará river is increasing 
rapidly this morning. A continuous high frequency tremor appeared on the station on 
Grímsfjall at 21:30 hours last night. The tremor amplitude increased steadily throughout the 
night and is about 16 times greater now at 9 am. <BR>
<BR>
November 5 - 10:00 GMT<BR>
The road across Skeiðarársandur has been closed. The jökulhlaup now surrounds the 
900 m long bridge across Skeiðará which has reached a flow rate of 6000 cubic m/s 
within the first 2 hours. "Icebergs" are breaking off the glacier snout and are being carried down 
with the flow. 
<P>
November 5 - 13:00 GMT<br> 
According to radio reports, the bridge across one
of the glacier rivers (Gígjukvísl) has now perished in the flood. The
power line is down and the telephone fiber cables have been cut by the flood.
The maximum tremor amplitude is around 240 units.
<p>
November 5 - 18:00 GMT<br>  
The bridge across Sæluhúsakvísl has been
demolished by the flood and the longest bridge in Iceland, the 900 m
long Skeiðará bridge is severely damaged as well, and not expected to
last much longer. Glaciologists surveying the flood from an aircraft at
15 h estimated the flow rate to be around 25,000 cubic m/s. The maximum
tremor is now 270 units. The Skeiðará bridge is worth 10 million US$.
The total damage to constructions today is estimated at about 15
million US$.
<p>
November 6. -  9:00 GMT <br>  
The jökulhlaup
culminated at 22:30 hours last night. At that time close to 45.000
cubic m/s flowed from Grímsvötn, along a 50 km long path beneath the
outlet glacier Skeiðarárjökull out to the alluvial plane,
Skeiðarársandur.  The high frequency tremor recorded at Grímsfjall
stayed fairly constant throughout the night and still has a maximum of
230 units. Although damaged, close to 700 m of the 900 m long Skeiðará
bridge is still standing but the bridges across Sæluhúsakvísl and
Gígjukvísl washed away. Skeiðará is the easternmost river draining this
region whereas Sæluhúsakvísl and Gígjukvísl are the central bridges.
The westernmost bridge, across Núpsvötn stayed intact. The initial
(main) phase of the jökulhlaup, which begun at 8 h yesterday morning
with a 3-5 m high water wave, flowed down the easternmost and central
part of the Skeiðarársandur plain, not reaching Núpsvötn until
afternoon yesterday. Many large icebergs (up to 200 tons) are scattered
on the plain.
<p>
November 6 - 10:00 GMT<br> 
Correction: Latest reports claim that the bridge across Sæluhúsakvísl
is still standing and that the jökulhlaup has decreased markedly. 
<p>
November 7 - 12:00 GMT<BR>
<BR>
The jökulhlaup has finished. The flowrate in the glacier rivers on 
Skeidarrsandur is now at 400 cubic m/s. At least 3 cubic km of water thick 
with ash and other fragments from the eruption have flowed from Grímsvötn, 
along the bottom of the glacier out to sea, within the last 52 hours. The 
water has left many huge icebergs, some are 10-15 m high weighing up to 
1000 tons.  The high frequency tremor recorded at the seismic station on 
Grimsfjall, on the southeastern rim of the Grímsvötn caldera, has decreased 
to less than 10 units. However, the instrument still records numerous 
"icequakes" which occur within the glacier as it is still being cracked in 
response to the sudden lowering of the iceshelf above the caldera lake.
<P>

November 8 - 11:00 GMT<BR>
<BR>
GPS measurements of the lake level at Grímsvötn showed it to be at 1345 m 
a.s.l. yesterday afternoon. Thus, the waterlevel subsided 165 m during the 
jökulhlaup. A 6 km long, 500 m wide and up to 200 m deep ice canyon has 
formed over the jökulhlaup outlet at the southeastern margin of Grímsvötn. 
The current subsidence is larger than during the April 1996 jökulhlaup, 
when the waterlevel subsided 74 m, from about 1454 m to 1380 m. 
This jökulhlaup carried up to 100 million tons of volcanic material and clay 
out to sea which could be traced up to 15 km out by its brown colour. It did, 
however, not trigger any lahars. Our seismic station at Grimsfjall still 
records numerous "icequakes" caused by collapsing crevasses and other 
glacier movement.

<B>The Volcanological Institute also reported, on November 5 1996: </B>
<BR>
The river <a href="route.gif">Skeiðará</a>, originating in the subglacial lake of the 
Grímvötn caldera, has started to increase. At present the frost in Iceland is between -2 to -20
degrees Centigrade thus glacial rivers should be at a minimum. This morning, however, 
a scientist observed that the river Skeiðará was increasing its discharge. The river smells 
strongly of sulphur and the water is loaded with sediments. It is expected that the river will 
increase its discharge rate for the next couple of days, until it reaches a maximum of perhaps 
20,000 to 30,000 m3/s. See this image for possible areas of <a href="flood.gif">flooding</a>.<BR>

<b>Iceland Review reported:</b><br>
<br>
<b>November 5. 1 pm:</b><br>
A tidal wave of black melt water and huge chunks of ice from last month's 
Vatnaj&ouml;kull eruption is hurtling southwards under and over Europe's largest 
glacier sweeping aside everything in its path. <br>
The giant flood, believed to be the greatest ever witnessed in Iceland, burst 
from the Lake Grimsv&ouml;tn caldera between 8-9am today. Scientists estimate 
that an initial 3km3 water came crashing under the glacier before washing over 
the sandy plains of the south lands. Such is the force of the flood that it 
blasted a 2km long crevice 100m from the edge of the glacier spewing the murky 
water forth in waves over the frozen surface.<br>
A bridge over the river G&yacute;gja has succumbed to the flood along with a 
fibre optic telecommunications cable. The ring road linking the south and east 
of the country has been swept away in several places, most dramatically either 
side of the Skeidar&aacute;r bridge, as engineers await the further destruction 
of bridges, roadway and power lines that is sure to follow in its wake. Meanwhile, vessels fishing in the waters off the south coast have been warned to haul in their gear as there is a danger of flood waves of silt sweeping over the ocean bed.<br>
A detection of disturbance around 10:30pm yesterday picked up by measuring 
equipment at Gr&iacute;msfjall, near the site of the eruption, sparked an initial 
warning although scientists were not sure whether what they were witnessing was 
a new sub-glacial eruption or that the colossal amount of melt-water was bursting 
through the ice dam of the Gr&iacute;msv&ouml;tn caldera. By early morning the 
measurement of disturbances grew ten-fold signalling that the wait for the flood 
was over. Within two hours, the volume of water had increased a hundred-fold.
<p>
<b>November 5. 5pm:</b><br>
"In just four hours this has knocked us back 20-30 years in terms of our road 
building endeavours," said Prime Minister Dav&iacute;d Oddsson after flying over 
south Iceland witnessing first hand the damage resulting from the immense flood 
water of the Vatnaj&ouml;kull glacial eruption.<br>
Scientists estimate the rate of water flooding the plains of the south to be 
gushing at a phenomenal 20,000 m3 per second and growing. Nobody has so far been 
able to say when the unstoppable wave of water will subside.<br>
Large stretches of the ring road have been washed away with three bridges in 
very real danger of being destroyed, including one of the country's largest and 
most important. One bridge, that over the river G&yacute;gja, has already been 
carried away by the tidal like flow of the glacial melt-water onslaught, costing 
the nation an estimated ISK300 million, around US$4.6 million, to replace.
