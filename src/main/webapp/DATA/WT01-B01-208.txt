<p align=center></p>
<p><i>Philadelphia, PA, March 13, 1996 -- </i>At the SAGES 1996 and 5th World Congress Meeting, Computer Motion, the world&#146;s 
leading supplier of medical robots, announced the unveiling of its next generation product - AESOP 2000 with Voice Control.<br>
</p>
<p>AESOP 2000 (pronounced &#147;eesop&#148;) is the second generation of the company&#146;s flagship product, and will feature the most 
intuitive interface available - the ability to understand a surgeon&#146;s voice commands. This allows the surgeon to use spoken 
English (instead of a Foot or Hand Control) to precisely control the position of the laparoscope. Stable vision and precise motion 
in laparoscopic procedures can now be controlled with simple voice commands.<br>
<br>
&#147;AESOP has always provided a consistent and rock-steady image of the operative site. Initially, the use of the Foot Control 
freed up the surgeon&#146;s hands and, effectively, provided a third arm,&#148; said Dr. Yulun Wang, Chief Technical Officer of Computer 
Motion. &#147;The introduction of Voice Control makes use of the robot seamless and perfectly intuitive.&#148;<br>
<br>
AESOP 2000 will also feature a more compact Controller that meets the performance standards and electrical safety 
requirements of the European Community.<br>
<br>
&#147;The advent of AESOP 2000 with Voice Control is a significant stride forward in enhancing surgical performance through 
advanced robotic technology,&#148; said Gene Wang, CEO of Computer Motion. &#147;AESOP 2000 exemplifies our commitment to 
delivering world-class medical robots. This company will continue to define new ways that will increasingly enable surgeons to 
perform surgical procedures more effectively and help hospitals reduce operative costs while improving the quality of care 
delivered to the patient.&#148;<br>
</p>
<p>AESOP (an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) was first introduced in October 1994. Over 
12,500 minimally invasive surgeries have been successfully assisted by AESOP in over 100 hospitals and surgery centers around 
the world.<br>
<br>
&#147;The robotic arm returns direct control of the optical field to the surgeon and provides a motionless image - ideal for advanced 
laparoscopic procedures,&#148; said Dr. W. Peter Geis, Director of the Minimally Invasive Surgical Training Institute in Baltimore, 
MA. &#147;AESOP 2000 with Voice Control goes the next step, allowing the surgeon to have very precise and predictable scope 
movements using the most natural interface known to humankind.&#148;<br>
<br>
Computer Motion is currently developing robotic devices for new surgical applications, which leverage the core technologies 
underlying the AESOP family of products. <br>
<br>
&#147;The Voice Control of AESOP is a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of surgeon-to-machine interfaces,&#148; said Dr. Bruce 
Steffes, a leading general surgeon at Cape Fear Hospital in Fayetteville, NC. &#147;Hospitals need to recognize that today&#146;s ORs are 
highly inefficient and costly to operate. Increasing direct surgeon control of the operating room environment through Voice Control 
is a significant step toward the OR of the future. Hospitals willing to take hold of this opportunity stand to remain viable in an 
ever-increasing competitive marketplace.&#148;<br>
<br>
Product availability of AESOP 2000 is pending 510(k) marketing clearance by the Food &amp; Drug Administration. Computer 
Motion anticipates clearance by the third quarter of this year.<br>
<br>
Computer Motion is the leader in medical robotics. The company&#146;s core development team, led by Dr. Yulun Wang, has 
worked together for over ten years and holds several key patents in robotics for medical applications. The company&#146;s website is 
at http://www.ComputerMotion.com. Computer Motion is privately held and is based in Goleta, California.<br>
