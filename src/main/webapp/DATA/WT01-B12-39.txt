 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FIBER IS IMPORTANT </H2>

<P>  Most people should begin a nutritional program with COLODYNE. A great majority of people have a sluggish digestive tract and would absorb many more nutrients if they had the good digestive tract hygiene provided by COLODYNE.</P>
 <P> Because of modern junk food diets, lack of vigorous exercise and the lack of adequate fiber in the diet, most people's colons are not healthy.  When partially digested food remains in the colon too long it decays. Little pockets form in the colon, called diverticulae, which trap this decaying food and spawn harmful bacteria action. This often leads to serious infection and inflammation called diverticulitis. Many physicians believe that the toxic by-products of this decaying debris may actually be a major cause of colon and other cancers.  It is imperative that these pockets be emptied and cleansed of any mucous build-up to avoid inflammation and infection. Fiber is the main dietary ingredient to accomplish this.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW COLODYNE WORKS</H2>
<P>  COLODYNE is an easy way to get a reasonable amount of fiber quickly. Its bulk helps promote good healthy muscle tone for the muscles of the colon wall. The Black Walnut, Beet Root, Papaya and Bromelain enzymes in COLODYNE help loosen the mucous build-up from the colon walls so it can be eliminated. Do not be alarmed if you pass strings of mucous after using COLODYNE for a couple of weeks as this is a good sign that you are detoxifying.</P>
 <P>  If you set aside three days each month to  eat only raw fruit and drink juices plus take COLODYNE three times per day in juice, you will give your colon a good opportunity to cleanse itself routinely. You will be surprised how good you will feel.</P>
<P> COLODYNE also contains Lactobacillus Salivarius, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Lactobacillus Bulgaricus and Lactobacillus Bifidus for beneficial bacteria that live in a healthy colon environment. These bacteria help in the synthesis of certain B vitamins, maintain proper colon pH, maintain normal consistency of stool and fight off` viruses, yeasts and harmful bacteria.</P>
<P>  COLODYNE also contains powdered Bentonite, a natural, high-quality clay that absorbs many toxins so they can be naturally eliminated.  Alginate is a sea weed substance that absorbs many toxic metals, especially aluminum, which is normally difficult for the body to eliminate.  Because aluminum cooking utensils have been so popular, aluminum toxicity is more widespread than recognized.  It can lead to depression   and   psychoses  and  be very damaging to heart muscle.</P>
<P>  The liver attempts to eliminate aluminum by incorporating it into the bile.   However, bile is ultimately secreted into the intestinal tract and most of the aluminum is reabsorbed. Alginate very efficiently holds the aluminum in the digestive tract so it can be eliminated through the stool.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  COLODYNE is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE COLODYNE</H2>
<P>  We recommend that COLODYNE be taken either in the morning right before breakfast or in the evening. Usually, one heaping teaspoonful, which provides 13 grams  of high  quality  soluble  fiber,  is  the recommended amount once a day. It is a good idea to take it twice a day for the first week or ten days.
  Place  one  to  two  heaping  teaspoonfuls  of  COLODYNE in a small jar or glass (with a lid) with three to four ounces of your favorite juice.  Usually, apple or orange juice is best. Shake briskly for about ten seconds and drink immediately. Do not let it stand after mixing as it will gel quickly and be difficult to swallow.  We recommend following with water or more juice to ensure adequate liquid. Use the extra liquid to remove  any remaining COLODYNE that may stick to the container. You may notice increased gas for a few days as you go through the initial phase of cleansing.</P>

 <P>
 Suggested Use:  Take one or two heaping teaspoons mixed in water or juice once or twice a day as a 
fiber and bulk supplement. Shake vigorously and drink immediately.</P>
