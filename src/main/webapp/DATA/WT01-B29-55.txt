<h2>CLAIM IX: DRUG PROHIBITION IS WORKING </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that drug prohibition is akin to
alcohol prohibition earlier this century. Their main premise is
that it is impossible to prohibit people from using substances
that they want to use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It seems obvious that it is impossible, by the DEA's own
evidence. But there are other reasons as well. Even if it was
possible, we should not undertake actions which do more harm than
good. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization forum felt that
legalization opponents should point to the successes of
Prohibition and to continuously stress the positive progress that
has been made between 1979 and 1994 in reducing levels of drug
abuse. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does the DEA feel that the &quot;successes of
Prohibition&quot; were so great that we should bring back
Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>When the Volstead Act was repealed, arrests for alcohol
traffickers disappeared, but arrests of alcohol related incidents
rose, indicating that the prohibition against alcohol had kept
people from using it. The same will happen if drugs are
legalized. Once drug use is sanctioned by the government, more
people will use drugs. </p>

<p>It is also important to remember that after Prohibition was
repealed, organized crime branched out into other areas, and
there is every expectation that current drug organizations would
also continue and diversify. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>After Prohibition was repealed, organized crime lost its
single biggest source of funding. This is the same argument the
DEA made before, that we must keep drug prohibition to keep the
drug dealers employed so they will not do something else. Again,
we have to asked what would happen if the DEA really did succeed
in stamping out drugs. Would we have to start selling them again
to keep the criminals from doing something else? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>· Dr. Mark Moore, in a 1992 article titled &quot;Actually,
Prohibition Was a Success&quot; points out that alcohol
consumption declined during the Prohibition years by as much as
3050%. Mental hospital admissions from alcoholinduced psychosis
declined 50%. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Wickersham Commission, which was formed to study and
improve Prohibition, found that alcohol use fell in the first
year of Prohibition and rose every year thereafter. </p>

<p>Assuming this was true, does that mean that the DEA is
advocating the return of alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· Robert Peterson, Director of the Michigan Office of Drug
Control Policy, states that &quot;Since the repeal of
Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does this mean that the DEA is advocating the return of
alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>· Alcohol, unlike currently illegal drugs, has a long history
of social acceptance and has an important role in many cultures.
Alcohol can also be selfadministered in small doses with little
damaging effects. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA is saying that some drugs can be sold in the local
store, while others merit a term in prison if you possess them.
The difference, it seems, is based on their popularity. By this
argument, when these drugs reach a certain level of popularity
then it will be appropriate to sell them as we do alcohol and
tobacco. </p>

<p>Other drugs also have a long history of social acceptance
which the DEA would like to deny. Marijuana (hemp), for example,
was once this nation's largest crop and was even grown by our
founding fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. </p>

<p>Most drugs can be self-administered in small doses with little
damaging effects and, in most examples of their use, they are. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>We are making progress in reducing the number of illicit drug
users. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Even if one believes the DEA's figures on this score (and
there is good reason to doubt them), the DEA's own figures show
that there has been no effect on hard core drug use. Further,
there is no evidence that the current policy is the best way to
reduce the number of drug users of any type. <br>
