<H2>Panel Activities</H2><p>
The Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel is an active group of industry experts, academic scholars, environmental advocates, and future-watchers that are concerned about our energy future.  Their committee activities and reports are used by the Department of Energy to help shape hydrogen research and development programs.  The HTAP meets twice each year, with the Spring meeting held in conjunction with the National Hydrogen Association's Annual Meeting in the Washington, D.C. area.  The location of the Fall meeting changes each year, based on the potential for associated technical tours or meetings.
<p>
The committees meet as required, with reports generated as work progresses.  Committee reports and minutes of the HTAP meetings are included for your information.
