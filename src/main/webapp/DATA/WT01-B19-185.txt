<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Says He Welcomes NORML's
Participation In Drug Debate</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 5, 1996, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey said that he welcomed <b>NORML</b>'s
involvement in the national debate over drug policy, while
speaking on National Public Radio. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b> Executive Director R. Keith Stroup, Esq. immediately
responded to the invitation and delivered a written acceptance
stating that the organization would be ready and willing to meet with
McCaffrey in either a private meeting or as part of an
appropriate forum. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We hereby request the opportunity to meet with you to
discuss our concerns with the administration's current drug
policy,&quot; announced Stroup.&nbsp; &quot;Although we clearly
do not agree on many issues, there may well be some areas, such
as adolescent marijuana smoking, in which we can work
cooperatively to achieve a common goal.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Senate Holds Special Hearing On Teen Drug
Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 4, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
In wake of a Department of Health and Human Services report
indicating that monthly use of illicit substances has doubled
among adolescents since 1992, the Senate Judiciary Committee
convened a special hearing to examine the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Speaking before the committee were Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY),
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala, and John Walters.&nbsp; All agreed that programs
to reverse current trends in teen drug use must focus on 1)
tougher drug penalties for adult users; 2) a clear and concise
message that use of any illicit substance is wrong; and 3) increased
federal spending on youth education programs such as DARE. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;What both the speakers and senators neglected to mention is
that none of these options have been effective in reducing teen
drug use,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Publications Director Paul
Armentano, who attended the hearing.&nbsp; &quot;Today's
graduating seniors are the first generation of adolescents who were
exposed to the most massive, consistent, and expensive federal
anti-drug campaign ever launched.&nbsp; They grew up listening to
DARE officers in the classroom and public service announcements
from the Partnership for a Drug Free America when they came home;
yet the statistics indicate that they are using drugs at far
higher rates than were their predecessors just four and five
years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In addition, more drug offenders are being arrested and
incarcerated for longer periods of time than ever before in our
nation's history.&nbsp; Clearly, this problem requires more than
the standard Washington rhetoric.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Re-Enacts Temporary &quot;Smoke A
Joint, Lose Your License&quot; Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 3, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Minutes before its post-midnight adjournment, the California
State Senate enacted a temporary, emergency &quot;Smoke a Joint,
Lose Your License&quot; bill.&nbsp; The decision surprised many
who noted that the Senate had turned down a similar measure
earlier in the day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The legislation was passed at the insistence of Gov. Pete Wilson,
a long-time advocate of the federal mandate.&nbsp; The law
requires a six-month driver's license suspension for all drug
offenses, regardless of whether they are driving-related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">State Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer is said to have
reluctantly agreed to the measure as a means of guaranteeing
federal highway aid.&nbsp; Under federal law, California must be
in compliance as of October 1, 1996 or else lose $100 million in
highway funding.&nbsp; The bill was passed as an emergency
measure so as to take effect immediately upon the Governor's
signature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In deference to opponents, the new law is set to expire within
six months.&nbsp; This will set the stage for another &quot;Smoke
a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; battle next year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Gov. Wilson's insistence on this foolish federal mandate is
one more costly example of Republican anti-drug hypocrisy,&quot;
said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer.&nbsp;
&quot;It's clearly absurd for the government to take [your]
driver's license away for possessing a joint in your home, yet
not for speeding and reckless driving with a bottle in your
car.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Activists Arrested On Trespassing
Charges<br>
After Being Banned From Attending Public Rally</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1996, Columbus, NC:</b>&nbsp; A
North Carolina couple were arrested and charged with trespassing
by the Polk County Sheriff's Department after attending a public
rally to promote medicinal marijuana in front of the county
courthouse. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although both Steve and Jean Marlowe were involved in organizing
the event, billed as the Second Annual Freedom Rally, Mr. Marlowe
had been told by county officials that he was forbidden from
attending because of allegations he smoked marijuana at last
year's festival.&nbsp; Marlowe was arrested on charges of
marijuana possession after last year's event, but the case is still
pending. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jean Marlowe argues that the recent arrest was in violation of
their civil liberties and the couple plans on pursuing legal
action against the county.&nbsp; &quot;County council says they
can set their own rules, but they can't violate your
rights,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;They can't forbid you to
attend a rally.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Philadelphia attorney Lawrence Hirsch has agreed to take the case
on behalf of the Marlowes and called the suit a matter of
principle.&nbsp; &quot;To me, every step of the way, [the county]
seem to be creating a case that's bound to blow up in there
face,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1995, <b>NORML</b> and the Southern California American Civil
Liberties Union filed a civil rights lawsuit against an Anaheim
ordinance that prohibited certain prior drug offenders from the right
to use public parks for lawful purposes.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
eventually prevailed in the challenge. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Juror Held In Contempt After Refusing To
Convict Drug Offender</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1996, Gilpin County, CO:</b>&nbsp; A
juror who maintains that she had &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;
regarding the guilt of a drug defendant could face over six
months in prison and an unspecified fine after being cited by
Gilpin County Judge Kenneth Barnhill for contempt of court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Laura Kriho is scheduled to begin a jury trial in late September
to defend herself against allegations that she tainted a jury in
the case of a 19 year-old female defendant charged with felony possession
of methamphetamine.&nbsp; According to Barnhill, Kriho allegedly
disobeyed a court order by discussing sentences in her
deliberations.&nbsp; Kriho insisted that she ultimately voted to
acquit because she had reasonable doubts as to the defendant's
guilt based on the facts of the case as presented by the
prosecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barnhill also alleged that Kriho committed perjury by lying under
oath to the Judge and the attorneys by failing to volunteer
information regarding a prior drug conviction from 1984.&nbsp;
Kriho argued that she was never specifically asked about her
criminal history and notes that she received a deferred sentence
for the 1984 conviction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I tried to do my job as a juror well,&quot; Kriho
said.&nbsp; &quot;I had never been on a jury before, and the whole
experience was unique and very stressful.&nbsp; Now I feel I am
being unfairly singled-out and punished for coming up with the
'wrong' verdict.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Paul Grant, who is representing Kriho in this case,
warned that the prosecution of his client threatens to undermine
the jury system.&nbsp; &quot;Jurors must be able to deliberate
independently of the judge, without the threat of criminal
prosecution hanging over their heads,&quot; he stated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Attorney Paul Grant @
