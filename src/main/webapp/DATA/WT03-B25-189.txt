Here's an update on DFA--and some of the other more recent developments aligned with it--according to one of the two men whose names are  synonymous with the 
practice: Dr. Peter Dewhurst...

<P>Design for Assembly (DFA) seems to have been eclipsed by other Designs for (--Service, --Environment, --Etc.) 
as they have come to the fore. It is ever thus, this inexorable march of new opportunities and possibilities. But asked about the status of DFA, at least from his point of view, Dr. Peter Dewhurst, director of graduate programs at the Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Dept. of the University of Rhode Island, and Co-founder of Boothroyd-Dewhurst, Inc. (Wakefield, RI), remarks, &quot;DFA is at the core of what we are doing.&quot; As in, he maintains that it is the essential element, or starting point, for these newer Design for activities.

<P>Boothroyd Dewhurst, Inc. developers, continue their pursuit of improvements in this area; the latest in their line of software packages is actually DFA 8.0, which operates on Windows 95 and Windows NT. The viability of DFA is undiminished.

<P>This could be somewhat surprising, in that Dewhurst recalls that the first DFA software package appeared in 1981. &quot;Back then, we thought we were developing tools for independent designers,&quot; he says. &quot;It wasn't until the mid-'80s, when Design for Manufacturing and Assembly were getting use and exposure, that there was another revolution in product development going on--working as teams.&quot; He notes that the now-famous Team Taurus, which was responsible for launching what was a revolutionary car, really put this concept of working as teams on the industrial and managerial landscape. Then people started talking about &quot;concurrent engineering&quot; and/or &quot;simultaneous engineering.&quot; As this turned from talk to implementation, the DFA software went from being a standalone, independent node in development to something that was a part of the mainstream. &quot;Since that time,&quot; Dewhurst says, &quot;it has served almost as much as a communication tool for teams as it has as an evaluation and analysis tool.&quot;

<P>&quot;It's gone a long way in automotive,&quot; Dewhurst observes. &quot;Most of the auto companies are at or beyond the point of getting suppliers to use DFA.&quot; As for those supplier companies that haven't started using DFA--if not the software, then at least the methodology--then it may be worthwhile, if not vital, for them to begin. &quot;We see many products from small companies that 
look like prototypes rather than products that we designed for production,&quot; Dewhurst says. An objective of DFA is to create designs for products that are not only functionally efficient and easy to assemble but which are also reliable and exhibiting quality. The products that Dewhurst is referring to were undoubtedly more the result of uncoordination than method.

<P>(Actually, it is possible to take un-DFA designed parts to be redesigned with DFA. There is actually a portion of the software that Boothroyd Dewhurst offers that allows users to subject each element in a part to analysis: Is it critical or not? If critical, then it remains an independent part. If it isn't critical, then it becomes a candidate for integration with other parts or elimination. 
The goal is to create a product that is as simple as it can be while still having the functional and aesthetic characteristics that are required.)

<P>As Dewhurst surveys the development of the DFA software, he points out that early on there were some fundamental 
limits built in as related to the way assembly would be performed that didn't necessarily reflect the way assembly was actually done. For example, in the cases of bench assembly tasks, the assumption was that the parts and the tools would be readily at hand. Now users are able to input information related to the distances that the parts are actually located in or near the workstation; tool location and even type can be inputted as well. Consequently, not only is DFA about designs, but it is also a tool that can 
be used for assembly line balancing. (There is an extensive library system built in to the software that includes design and processing best practices.)

<P>So what about these other Designs for? Dewhurst says that about three years ago they began work on Design for Service (DFS) at the University of Rhode Island with seed money provided by Battelle Memorial Institute. One of the objectives was to look at how products could be disassembled for purposes of servicing them. DFS actually works with DFA. DFA allows a designer and/or engineer to build up a product; the same data can be used to methodically tear it down. In fact, in the software developed for DFS, it is a matter of simply pointing and clicking at the element on the product design image and the disassembly routine is created. (As for the designs: there is DFA/Pro--an integration of the Boothroyd Dewhurst DFA analysis software with Pro/engineer CAD software from Parametric Technology. Dewhurst says that EDS is developing an interface for Unigraphics CAD software.)

<P>Okay. So you have the assembly (DFA) and the disassembly (DFS) sequences. A couple of years ago, a grant from 
consumer electronics giant Samsung was received; that company was interested in design for the environment (DFE). So Dewhurst and his colleagues started looking at a washing machine, a television and a refrigerator from the standpoint of the end of their life possibilities. Enter the TNO Product Centre (Netherlands), an organization that, Dewhurst explains, had built up plenty of experience on life cycle analysis and data related to the environmental impacts and financial paybacks of components. So TNO and Boothroyd Dewhurst joined forces. The software package developed combines disassembly with a value assessment 
metric developed at TNO: MET, which stands for Materials, Energy, Toxicity.

<P>Fundamentally, in the DFE sequence, it is a matter of disassembling a product in a step-by-step manner. It can be 
indicated whether a particular product is to be recycled (there is a database of material scrap values) or reused (an expected value for the reused component can be entered). There are actually two bottom lines. One is a financial line. It basically provides a trade off between the disassembly labor costs and the value of what's being recovered or recycled. It can indicate where the 
disassembly should stop and disposal proceed if the key interest is a return on investment. The second bottom line is an environmental scoring line. &quot;It always starts out negative,&quot; Dewhurst says. As disassembly proceeds and negative environmental effects are reversed, points are &quot;won back.&quot;

<P>The Big Three are looking at recycling, individually and together, through the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP), which is a group that operates under the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR). One concern is that there are European regulations for some products that require that the manufacturers take back products and/or packaging for recycling and disposal, which could extend to automobiles. Consequently, auto manufacturers in Europe, manufacturers who sell products there, are looking at environmentally correct designs. &quot;What we imagine at some point down the road,&quot; Dewhurst says, &quot;is that there may be some environmental goalposts setup during the design stage.&quot;

<P>The DFA stage. Even at that future time, DFA will continue to matter.

<P>
<P><I>Here are some numbers from <BR>
Booth-royd Dewhurst about the average returns that users of DFA software have realized . . .</I>
<UL>
<LI>Reduction in manufacturing cycle time:57.3%
<LI>Part count reduction:51.4%
<LI>Part cost reduction:37%
<LI>Time-to-market improvements:50%
<LI>Quality and reliability improvements:68%
<LI>Reduction in assembly time:62.3%
</UL>

<P>Green Instrument Panel
<P>Without question, thermoplastics have become a dominant material in vehicle interiors. Think about the instrument panel (IP), for example. The people at GE Plastics (Pittsfield, MA) certainly think about IPs and 
thermoplastics. In May, GE Plastics awarded the University of Rhode Island's Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Dept. with a one-year, $87,000 contract to look at instrument panels from the standpoint of environmental design. Dr. Peter Dewhurst of the University of Rhode Island says that the researchers are looking at an IP from a 1989 midsize truck and one from a current production model. The idea is to assess the ability to recover materials and instruments and to collaborate with automotive industrial designers in coming up with future IP design concepts that are both economically and environmentally correct.
