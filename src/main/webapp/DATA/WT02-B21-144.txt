<H1>ASF/STEP Software & Tools Release Updates</H1>
The purpose of this page is to inform any users of new releases and
updates to our tools. Individual programs are updated as the need arises
(in case of bug report or a user requested feature). The whole ASF/STEP
tool package is updated about once a month to every two months. An entire
tool update is to make sure that all of our tools can be installed either
individually or as a group without complications. If you have any
questions, contact <A HREF="mailto:mshindle@iias.images.alaska.edu">Mike
Shindle</A > or any other tools developer. 
<P>
Last Entire Tool Release: <B>May 31, 1996</B>

<H2>Release Update - May 31, 1996</H2>
All the tools were rearchived and placed in the FTP directories. CEOS
metadata reading is now handled by one program, <A
HREF="swdesc.html#metadata">metadata</A>. The programs,
<B>get_facdr_data</B> and <B>get_mpdrec_data</B> have been discontinued.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Release Update - March 11, 1996</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#geom1p">Geom1p</A> was altered to prevent a grid
check. By forcing the calculated grid, regardless of mapping checks,
southern ASF station mask images can now be geocoded. Version 7.1 is only
required if an error was experienced trying to geocode images. 
<HR>
<H2>Release Update - January 15, 1996</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#orb_pred">Orb_pred</A> is still in the process of
being repaired. However, the orb_pred program produces errors for
locations outside of Alaska for phases A-E. Testing is occurring for the
other phases. This semi-new version is available by FTP, however orb_pred
is still retaining the previous version number. A new number will be added
when all ERS-1 phase data has been updataed and testing completed. 
<HR>
<H2>Release Update - November 15, 1995</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#orb_pred">Orb_pred</A> is in the process of being
repaired. The orb_pred program produces errors for locations outside of
Alaska. We are waiting for the appropriate orbital information to fix this
bug. 
<P>
<H2>Release Update - October 3, 1995</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#sarin">Sarin</A> has been updated to handle data
files of more than one type. Sarin can now handle WORD (16-bit integer),
LONG (32-bit integer), and REAL (32-bit float) as well as BYTE (8-bit
integer). A new command lien option was added to specify which file to be
used. Also an unformatted man page was added. 
<P>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#resample">Resample</A> has been modified to handle
the changes made to the library function create_ddr(). Create_ddr() now
accepts file data type as an argument. 
<P>
<H2>Release Update - September 20, 1995</H2>
All our tools have been updated to include either a preformatted or
man-coded help or man pages. To access these file by typing <B>man</B>
<I>tool</I> at the command line, add the following to your <B>MANPATH</B>
environment variable: <B>(<I>installation_point</I>)/asf_tools/man</B>.
