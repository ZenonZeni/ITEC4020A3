<DD> Children's development is examined in the framework of cognitive apprenticeship.   In Part I, Rogoff draws on the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky, and explores the culture context of cognition.  The mutuality of the social world and the individual is examined.  Part II discusses guided practice and issues in choosing and structuring activities for children to promote their cognitive growth.  Part III focuses on research and speculation regarding adult-child and peer interactions as they relate to guided practice.<BR>

<BR>
<DD> Meta-analysis of 16 experimental studies which examined the effects of reciprocal teaching on achievement.  Two groups of studies were reviewed: those in which all strategies were taught during the modeling dialogues, and those in which students were first introduced to the strategies via worksheet activities.<BR>
<BR>
In general, findings were positive.  The median effect size for teacher-made assessments was .88, for standardized tests it was .32.   There were no differences in results based on grade level, number of instructional sessions, or class size.  Less able students (but those who were able to decode text) did have greater pre- to post-test gains than did those of average or high ability, however.   On possible explanation for this was that the more able readers were already employing metacognitive strategies.<BR>
<BR>
One of the major shortcomings of the studies noted by the reviewers was a lack of attention to the quality of the reciprocal teaching.   This is a  critical aspect of  reciprocal teaching that needs to be addressed.  The authors list 5 criteria that may be explored in future studies:  (a) concentration on the "concept level" rather than "word level" of student contributions to dialogue, (b) attention to linking student ideas to new constructs, (c) dialogues with focus and direction, (d) making the purpose of instruction explicit, and (e) constructive formative evaluation.<BR>

<BR>
<DD>Discusses using videodisc players for graphic displays of real-life problems solving situations.  Preparing for Calculus is a series of 8 modules each focusing on a topic in precalculus, such as number line and inequalities, functions, exponents, and the like.  The format for each module is as follows:  a mathematician models the concept to be learned and then real-world examples are shown with voice-over explanations.  The computer then presents an initial problem to the student, which is used to assess his or her initial understanding.  Based on error patterns, the computer suggests certain practice exercises.  Individual problems can be presented with the "prompt" feature enabled or disabled.  This feature explicitly draws the student's attention to relevant aspects of the previous demonstrations.<BR>

Social learning theory and Vygotsky's concept of scaffolding and the zone of proximal development provide the theoretical backdrop for this videodisc program. It is aligned with the principles of cognitive apprenticeship, as well.  The lesson begins with modeling, followed by practice and feedback and gradual diminution of help.   The computer acts as scaffolder, assessing the student's current ability and ZPD, and providing constructive feedback to support the student.  The prompt device governs the cognitive load taken on by the students.<BR>
<BR>
One serious limitation of this program is in the nature of the scaffolding; the computer is not sensitive to the individual learner in this regard.   The computer can assess each student's ZPD and choose subsequent problems accordingly, but it cannot substitute for the personal attention of a teacher who can more readily tailor explanations and tasks to incorporate individual differences.  Thus, a more beneficial approach would be to develop a videdisc module that permits (or perhaps requires) a degree of teacher-student interaction as well.<BR>

<DD> Discusses computer-mediated communication (CMC) as it may be used to "link the minds of many children and scientists in a multiple electronic zone of proximal development."   Focuses on the social and cultural aspect of learning and on the possibility of contact between experts and novices on a large scale.  In attending to the culture and prior knowledge and experiences of individual students, proposes that profiles of students be gathered.  Thus, the computer could tailor (to the degree that the programming permits) explanations to students to take into account their gender, race, social and cultural background, and relevant prior experiences.<BR>

<BR>
<DD> Gives practical advice to teachers in utilizing technology in their classrooms for lessons which involve simulation, exploration, or experimentation.  Outlines a three-step process designed to  use technology to give students access to mathematical concepts.  Step 1 is to learn the technology.  As a teacher, one must be intimately familiar and comfortable with anything he or she uses to instruct students.  The second step is to list the attributes of the technology -- that is, to distinguish what the program does as opposed to what it is used for.  For example, the attributes of a spreadsheet include use of recursive formulas, and organization of data in matrix form.  The third step is to match problem-solving strategies with the attributes.  This is difficult because it changes the nature of the classroom.  That is, the teacher must formulate not how to explain a concept, but how to pose questions so that the students can construct knowledge.<BR>
