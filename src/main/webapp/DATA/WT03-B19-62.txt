<H1>TeraScan Supports III Corps Exercise</H1>

<P>
A weatherman's dream of receiving weather satellite imagery in the field came true when the United States Army Space Command demonstrated the High Resolution
Satellite Receiver (HRWSR) at Fort Hood, TX from October 27 to November 9, 1994.  The purpose of the demonstration was to show to tactical commmanders the "value added" of real-time, high resolution weather satellite imagery
and vertical sounder data.
</P>

<P>
Despite the fact that the effectiveness of modern weapon systems is highly dependent on environmental conditions, the importance of weather information to Army commanders is often underated.  Weather 
information is needed to support ground and air maneuvers as well as direct and indirect (including deep) fires.
</P>

<P>
The HRWSR is a commercially available system that acquires, processes, displays, and archives weather satellite imagery and vertical sounder data from polar orbiting satellites.  The acquisition
subsystem is a 1.0 meter diameter reflecting antenna, mounted on a gyro-stabilizing platform.  The processing subsystem is a computer worksation with programs to automatically position
the antenna to acquire each satellite pass to turn the sensor data into earth-located imagery and data fields, and to permit
an operator to prepare weather information for Army users.  The color monitor allows high resolution display of cloud imagery and data fields annotated
with geopolitical boundaries and latitude/longitude lines.  The software
also gives the operator the capability to zoom, to animate imagery, and to enhance with color.
</P>

<P>
The HRWSR deployed on the back of a 2 1/2 ton truct to the III corps staff Weather Officer's work tent in the Corps Tactical Operations Center (CTOC) on November 2.  Two USARSPACE operators, Mr. Jeff 
Faunce and Mr. Arthur Kyle, went with the system.  For the next week, the HRWSR and its two operators remained at the CTOC field site, acquiring data 
from polar orbiting weather satellites that came within line-of-sight
of the antenna.  Imagery and data from an average of ten satellite passes per day were processed.
</P>

<P>
The advantage that space-based assets bring to the battlefield - the capability to view the entire area of operators - was continually emphasized to the III corps weather staff and their customers.  The primary product
of interest was visual and infrared imagery from the <A HREF="/glossary.html#DMSP">DMSP</A> and <A HREF="/glossary.html#TIROS">TIROS</A> weather satellites.  Visual wavelengths were used to view the earth during daylight and
infrared wavelengths were used during darkness.  Imagery was registered to mercator map projections for the CONUS, the area of Texus and surrounding states, and the Central Texas area (about 100 miles
radius of Fort Hood).  This allowed the weather staff to view weather conditions on the synoptic scale, the mesoscale, and the microscale, respectively.  Thus the weather staff monitored clouds produced by weather systems
affecting Fort Hood at the time fo satellite passage and clouds from weather systems that would impact Fort hood 2-3 days in the future.  In addition, vertical sounder data were used extensively to overlay upper level winds,
temperature, analyses, and height contours on imagery.  The weather staff then used all of this information to prepare products capable of
supporting III Corps organizations such as aviation, intelligence, artillery, engineer, and chemical.
</P>

<P>
The first operational demonstration of the High Resolution Weather Satellite Receiver was judged a success.  The system performed flawlessly at both of the field sites.  The weather team used the imagery and data to prepare weather products for Army decision makers, and useful feedback was collected.
