    depression.</p>
    <p><b>Antimanic:</b> Medication used to treat the manic
    episodes of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness).</p>
    <p><b>Antipsychotic</b>: Medication used to treat psychosis
    -- for example, in schizophrenia.</p>
    <p><b>Bipolar Disorder</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    manic and major depressive episodes, with periods of recovery
    generally separating the mood swings. Psychosis may be
    present during manic episodes. Bipolar disorder usually
    begins in the mid 20s and is chronic.</p>
    <p><b>Brain Disorder</b>: A severe mental illness, such as
    schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
    bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major depression.</p>
    <p><b>Cerebral Cortex</b>: The portion of the brain that is
    critical in decisionmaking. Abnormalities in the cortex
    structure and functioning have been identified as likely
    causes of brain disorders.</p>
    <p><b>Dopamine</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain. This neurotransmitter
    appears to play some role in brain disorders such as
    schizophrenia.</p>
    <p><b>Hippocampus</b>: A nucleus in the brain crucial to
    learning and memory; part of the limbic system.</p>
    <p><b>Limbic System</b>: A network of structures in the brain
    associated with control of emotion and behavior --
    specifically, perception, motivation, gratification, memory,
    and thought. </p>
    <p><b>Locus Ceruleus</b>: A nucleus in the brain that is
    involved in, among other things, the body&#146;s response to
    stressful situations, such as the fight-or-flight response.</p>
    <p><b>Major Depression</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    profound depression -- that is, loss of interest or pleasure
    in activities, sadness, and feelings of helplessness. Other common
    symptoms include weight gain or loss, insomnia or excessive
    sleepiness, slowed or agitated movement, intense feeling of
    guilt or worthlessness, diminished ability to concentrate,
    and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Bouts of
    depression commonly recur. Psychosis may also accompany major
    depression. The typical age of onset is the late 20s.</p>

    by irritability, expansiveness, elation, talkativeness,
    hyperactivity, and excitability.</p>

    chemicals) -- namely norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.</p>
    <p><b>Monoamine-Oxidase Inhibitor (MAO)</b>: A class of antidepressants
    that acts by prolonging monoamine activity; generally used to
    treat persons who do not respond to tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
    <p><b>Norepinephrine</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain.
    Alterations in the neurotransmitter have been implicated in
    several brain disorders.</p>
    <p><b>Neuron</b>: Nerve cell; the basic functional unit of
    the nervous system that processes information in the brain.</p>
    <p><b>Neurotransmitter</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain
    which can play a role in brain disorders.</p>
    <p><b>Neurological Disorder</b>: Disorder pertaining to the
    nervous system, which is made up collectively of the brain,
    cranial nerves, spinal cord, spinal nerves, and other nerve
    cells and maintains the vital function of reception and response
    to stimuli. </p>
    <p><b>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</b>: A brain
    disorder characterized by recurrent and persistent thoughts,
    images, or ideas perceived by the sufferer as intrusive and senseless (obsessions)
    and by stereotypic, repetitive, purposeful actions perceived
    as unnecessary (compulsions). The average age of onset is 20.
    OCD is generally chronic, with symptoms waxing and waning.
    The disorder frequently occurs with depression and Tourette&#146;s
    syndrome, a neurological disorder.</p>
    <p><b>Panic Disorder</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    sudden, inexplicable bouts, or attacks, of intense fear and
    strong bodily symptoms -- namely, increased heart rate, profuse
    sweating, and difficulty in breathing. Panic attacks occur
    twice a week, on average. The disorder is usually chronic,
    with symptoms waxing and waning, and the average age of onset
    is 24. Antidepressants and antianxiety drugs, as well as psychotherapy,
    are often used to treat panic disorder.</p>
    <p><b>Parity</b>: Equal health insurance coverage for brain

    synapse by the neuron that released it.</p>
    <p><b>Schizophrenia</b>: A brain disorder characterized by
    disturbance of cognition, hallucinations, and impaired
    emotional responsiveness. Schizophrenia usually begins in the
    late teen years or the early 20s. The disorder cannot now be cured
    or prevented, but its symptoms can be treated.</p>
    <p><b>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</b>:
    Medications which control the transmission of serotonin
    between brain cells and thus help treat the symptoms of such brain
    disorders as depression.</p>
    <p><b>Serotonin</b>: A chemical messenger in the brain. This neurotransmitter
    has been implicated in several brain disorders, including
    major depression and bipolar disorder.</p>
    <p><b>Synapse</b>: The site at which an impulse is
    transmitted from one nerve cell to the other, typically by a
    neurotransmitter.</p>
