<H1>Checklist for Exam Number 1</H1>
<BR>

<P>
The following is a list of the important keywords and concepts that we have
learned so far in this course.  You can use this as a study guide for 
the exam on October 3rd.

<H3>Systems</H3>
<P>
feedback, system, plant, compensator, sensor, actuator, input, reference input, output,
disturbance, transfer function, linearity, superposition,  block diagram.
<BR>
<H3>Laplace Transforms</H3>
<BR>
Laplace Transforms, complex numbers, complex plane, real and imaginary parts, s-plane,
magnitude and phase angle,
unit impulse, unit step, impulse response, step response, transfer 
function, Final Value Theorem, differential equation, initial conditions, 
residue, partial fraction expansion, poles and zeros, convolution. 
<BR>
<H3>Modeling</H3>
<BR>
modeling, circuits, Kirchoff's Laws, Laplace Transform, operational amplifier, impedance,
mechanical system, electrical systems, dc-servo motor, linearization of nonlinear systems.
<BR>

<P>
It is important that you understand what a simple block diagram means,
what information the impulse response and the step response give you and
how to compute them.  You will need to know how to derive the equations
for simple electrical and mechanical systems and to derive the transfer
functions relating inputs and outputs.  There will be no Matlab
questions, nor will you have to memorize Laplace Transform pairs.  You
will be given a short table of Laplace Transforms.  In addition you are
allowed a single page of notes.
