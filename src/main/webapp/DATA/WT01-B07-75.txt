ABSTRACT A passive ventilation system in Hokkaido is not spread
at present. This report presents the concept and the housing system
to the airtight performance for the passive ventilation, so two
subject are discussed. The first subject is the changes in the
ventilation rate and the permissible level of change. Changes
in the ventilation rate caused by a stack effect were measured
in an airtight test house from autumn to winter by tracer gas
techniques. It was found that the effect of changes of wind velocity
on changes in the ventilation rate was smaller than the effect
of temperature difference between inside and outside. The passive
ventilation system in the airtight test house was able to supply
the required amount of fresh air in winter when the temperature
difference between inside and outside was large. The second subject
is the appropriate installation of an inlet for fresh air and
the best method for circulating air in occupant spaces. As the
temperature of outdoor air is very low in winter, the fresh air
coming into the house must be warmed. The buffer space under the
floor maybe used as a chamber to warm the cold outdoor air and
to distribute the warmed fresh air. Such a ventilation system
in homes in cold regions can greatly improve the indoor environment.

ABSTRACT This research is aimed to develop the leakage measuring
technique by AC-pressurization method (AC-Press), which applies
the sinusoidal volume changing to the building to be tested. This
paper describes the principles and the characteristics including
the comparison of the DC-pressurization method (DC-press), that
is, AC-Press has less impact to indoor environment during the
measurement, and is not necessarily penetrating the envelop with
a duct for the testing. Also instrumentation of this method is
indicated and the laboratory experiment using scale model with
four holes is executed. Effective Leakage Area (ELA) of the holes
were measured by DC-Press. The results show that reproducibility
is confirmed and that the difference of ELA between AC-Press and
DC-Press varies from -2.2% to -7.7%. Furthermore the effect of
the flow exponent and phase lag between room volume change and
pressure change upon the estimated ELA is discussed.

ABSTRACT The commitment to reduce energy consumption by buildings
has focused attention of making new domestic buildings well insulated
by employing measures such as insulated cavity walls, double glazed
sealed windows and insulated lofts. However in all the houses
there is an air ventilator which is simply a hole in the wall
with two air grilles on either side. To investigate thermal comfort
due to air ventilators position, air flow measurements were carried
out in two new houses where the air ventilators are placed at
high and low level. The amount of air flow into the lounge was
measured, together with air velocity and temperature distribution
across the air ventilator and the lounge at two levels of 0.15m
and 1.2m. These results show that in cases were the air ventilator
is placed at low level in the lounge, cold air flows into the
lounge and the temperature difference between head and ankle level
for a seated person, is more that 3oC.

ABSTRACT In order to evaluate a given ventilation system in a
livestock building and its sensitivity to wind, presence of heat
sources (e.g. livestock) etc.it is of interest to estimate flow
vector fields corresponding to the airflow. By introducing particles
(e.g. smoke) into the air inlets of a model of a livestock building,
the airflow in a laser-illuminated plane may be visualized. Based
on sequences of images recorded of this place using a video camera,
estimates of 2-D flow vectors are derived locally. The local estimates
of velocity are found using a set of spatio-temporal convolution
filters on the image sequence. After which the local estimates
are integrated to smooth flow fields using a model that incorporates
spatial smoothness. The algorithms are illustrated using a scale
model of a pigs sty under isothermic conditions. It should be
noted that this is an non-invasive technique (laser and camera
may be placed so they do not disturb the airflow) for estimating
air velocity in a 2-D plane.

ABSTRACT Prediction and measurement of interzonal airflow in a
building is important in evaluating and planning IAQ, thermal
comfort, etc. In our experimental house, we planed the distribution
of fresh air, passive ventilative cooling in summer. In this context
the measurement of multi-zone airflow in this house, considered
as 17 rooms, was needed. In application of the measurement method
using a single tracer gas, based on the system identification
theory proposed by Okuyama, some improvements were made to secure
accuracy. The additional measurement for the fresh airflow from
outside to each room was also carried out by another method of
constant-concentration. In this paper, these measurements and
results are described.

ABSTRACT Multiple tracer gas techniques for measuring interzonal
airflow rates between zones in a multizone building involve the
sampling and measurement of the concentration of each tracer gas
in each zone. Continuous measurements of gas concentrations in
each zone are usually not practical. The usual approach is discrete
sampling and measurement with one instrument for each gas. Two
methods, the differential method and the integral method, are
commonly used to calculate the interzonal airflows from the measured
tracer gas concentrations. A previous study by the authors showed
that both methods give similar results when the data were obtained
under well controlled laboratory conditions. As tracer gas concentrations
measured under field conditions are often not as accurate as those
measured under laboratory conditions, a further comparison of
these methods was made to determine their accuracies in field
applications. This paper presents the results of this comparison.

ABSTRACT In highly airtight and insulated houses, Osaka Gas has
installed a ventilation and air-conditioning system that takes
advantage of the structural characteristics of these houses, such
as underfloor space and vent sections in the wall. To verify that
the system can vent air from underfloor into residence rooms with
no problem, the VOC concentration of the indoor atmosphere was
measured under various conditions immediately after completion
of the house. The result confirms that the VOC concentration is
reduced by operating the ventilation unit and &quot;bake-out&quot;.
The ventilation rate and the temperature were also measured. With
the client family living in the house, the heat environment was
measured under the heating conditions in winter. The measurement
shows that the present system can heat rooms comfortably with
little difference in temperature among rooms due to radiation
from floors and walls.

ABSTRACT This paper introduces the research at a new type of task
conditioning concept, the desk displacement ventilation concept.
The total research comprises several phases, in which the measurement
and calculation of indoor airflows play a major role: 1. Literature
research on velocity measurement techniques. 2. Experimental tests
of different velocity measurement techniques, in particular the
Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique. 3. Measurements
at a full-scale experimental set-up of an office-model, equipped
to operate according to the desk displacement ventilation concept.
4. Comparison with Computational Fluid Dynamics-simulations. After
the introduction of the new desk displacement ventilation concept,
this paper reports on phases one and two of this research project.
A theoretical analysis of the PTV-technique shows its suitability
for indoor airflows. Two PTV-experiments underline the quantitative
and qualitative possibilities. The generation of sufficient and
consistently neutrally buoyant soap bubbles, which are used as
tracer particles, still requires a technical solution.

ABSTRACT The contaminant concentration inhaled by an occupant
(ie. the personal exposure) is usually less than the return concentration
in displacement ventilated rooms. Tow main questions are investigated:
1. Does the exhalation from one person penetrate the breathing
zone of another person placed nearby, thus leading to larger personal
exposure? 2. When two persons are placed close to each other,
do the convective boundary layer flows interact so that the personal
exposure to an ambient concentration field is altered? These problems
are investigated experimentally: Full-scale experiments are made
in a displacement ventilated room with two breathing thermal manikins.
When the manikins are facing each other, interaction can take
place, and the exposure is increased. Horizontal distance between
manikins and horizontal inclination of exhalation flow are important
parameters. If exhalation is directed towards the back, larger
exposures do not occur. When two persons stand close together,
the exposure to ambient concentration is not altered. Traditional
one or two-zone models are not adequate for the case of face-to-face
respiration. When people are standing close or respirating face-to
back, normal exposure levels for displacement ventilation can
be expected.

simulation code has been adopted and FLAIR has been utilized which
is the architectural section in the PHOENICS program of the CHAM
company. The result of the simulation predicts summer overheating
at the CHONAN Railway Station in order to propose recommendation
for alternatives in improving the summer indoor air condition.

ABSTRACT A study has been carried out of heat recovery from air
that ventilates a hot tool in a tool shop. The recovered heat
is used to preheat air for the space heating of this tool shop.
Software has been used to analyze the heat-recovery efficiency
and thermal comfort for a variation of environmental temperature.
An increase of environmental temperature of IK yields a heat saving
of 2% and an increase of temperature in the tool shop of 2K. Additional
adjustment of air flow for thermal comfort in the tool shop decreases
heat expenditure for 1%. Contrary holds for a decrease of outside
temperature.

ABSTRACT Non-steady numerical simulation is performed to predict
thermal environment in a passive solar room with a Trombe wall.
With a weather model assuming a typical winter day of Osaka Japan,
the simulation is continued until the test room thermal environment
becomes periodically steady conditions. It needs about five days
using a fully implicit time marching method the time step of which
is 1 minute. The thermal storage effect of the Trombe wall is
confirmed qualitatively and the CFD code proved to be a useful
means to design various passive solar systems. As for computer
efforts saving, a simple method that only temperature field is
calculated every time step proved to be effective. For example,
a simulation in which flows field is calculated every three time
steps while temperature field is calculated every step saved CPU
time nearly 50% compared with a simulation in which all variables
are calculated every time step.

ABSTRACT Modern design of air supply devices is to ensure proper
delivery of conditioned air in a space to provide a conditioned
air in a space to provide a comfortable environment with good
air quality. Since most of the devices have a complex geometry,
it is a challenging task to predict airflow pattern in such a
device. This paper reports the simulation of a complex air diffuser
with the Computational-Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) technique. The &quot;standard&quot;
k-e model was used in the CFD technique. Three different grid
systems were employed to present the complex geometry: cylinder
coordinate with small steps, body-fitted-coordinate, and unstructured
grids. Compared with airflow pattern observed by smoke, the results
show that the CFD technique with cylinder coordinate could not
predict the airflow pattern correctly. This is because excessive
high turbulence is calculated in the boundary layer with small
steps. Although the labor costs are high for grid-generation,
the computed velocity vectors with the body-fitted coordinate
and unstructured grid systems agree with those by flow visualisation
technique.

ABSTRACT A numerical study of the influence of dynamic and turbulent
inlet boundary conditions has been carried out for a forced convection
flow in a two-dimensional enclosure. The turbulent flow is predicted
via a k-e model. In the first part, it is shown that the turbulent
K and e inlet boundary conditions do not significantly affect
the flow pattern. The second part of this work deals with the
influence of the inlet jet profile (plane or parabolic) on the
flow. It is reported here that while the average flow is not greatly
affected by the inlet profile. The fluctuating part of the flow
is modified by the jet profile. If the inlet Reynolds number is
kept constant, this phenomenon is amplified for an increasing
inlet dimension.

ABSTRACT This paper presents a preliminary investigation of oscillatory
flow caused by two opposing free convection boundary layers, which
can be found in a number of building airflow applications. As
second order numerical simulation is carried out to investigate
both the 2D and 3D colliding free convection boundary layers at
low Rayleigh numbers. The present predicted non-dimensional frequency
of the periodic flow and onset of oscillation agree well with
the experimental data of Kitamur et al. (1984). It is found that
three-dimensional oscillations of the flow at some Rayleigh numbers
are accompanied by a well-organised array of secondary vortices.
It is suggested that the Taylor Rayleigh instability causes the
formation of secondary vortices and fingering of fluids across
the colliding fluid interface, which then leads the two dimensional
oscillations into three-dimensional instabilities.

ABSTRACT There are a number of methods available concerning with
air distribution in buildings. Within control research, one can
find new control algorithms which have not been used in practice
yet. These new algorithms open the possibility of developing and
implementing of new demand controlled ventilation systems. In
a building the internal air motions are due both to differences
in temperature and due to pressure difference induced by the ventilation
system. Therefore, one fundamental question is to what extent
one can with fan powered ventilation control the air motions within
a building. The aims of this paper is to report on development
of methods to study the air motions in a multiroom residence apartment
using various combinations of exhaust and supply air management.
The experimental work includes measurements of air flow rates
in door opening in both directions and use of various tracer gas
methods to determine the supply air flow to each room and identifying
flow paths. In an accompanying paper (Bjorsell 1996) is reported
on the results from a simulation of the performance of different
control algorithms.

ABSTRACT One method of maintaining good indoor air quality without
extensive energy consumption is to control the ventilation rate
according to the needs and demands of the occupants. If the system
can be described by mathematical equations, it is possible to
create a suitable control system. Indoor climate involves both
fresh air and the right temperature. There is a close connection
between temperature control and control of internal flows, because
large air motions are set up by temperature differences between
rooms.

ABSTRACT The air jet issuing from a supply device is the basic
flow element in a ventilated room. Thus a careful theoretical
understanding and experimental study of the boundary conditions
at exit, wall and the entrainment region are of vital importance.
An examination of the behaviour of jets in other industrial applications
available in the literature shows that in a closed space the situation
is very complex. There are recirculation effects due to an opposite
wall, and there are three different flow regimes at the same time
(laminar, transitional and turbulent) and finally the enclosure
size can strongly influence the jet properties. Numerical simulations
of such a complex flow can not be successful when one applies
the widely used standard k-e turbulence model. A low Reynolds
model can be used in the near wall regions but the anisotropy
and streamline curvature effects require at least an isotropic
second moment closure model. The aim of this investigation is
:i) to examine the reliability and restrictions of a standard
and a non-linear two-equation turbulence model by making comparison
with experiments, ii) the jet momentum calculation is discussed
by exploring a new momentum balance model and compared with an
experimental method for determining the momentum of a jet, iii)
the boundary layer thickness calculation, the turbulence integral
length scale and time scale which are based on the measurements,
moreover the usefulness of this knowledge in numerical calculations
is discussed.

ABSTRACT Air distribution design approaches currently available
to consulting engineers are discussed. Each has advantages and
disadvantages that limit applicability and accuracy. The proposed
approach uses air jet theory and statistical analysis of air temperature,
air velocity and contaminant concentration distributions. Data
are from physical and numerical simulation of air distribution
in realistic rooms and field application. Kinetic energy analysis
is used for evaluation of average velocities and turbulence intensity-information
that is required for evaluation of thermal comfort and rates of
contaminant release into the room.

ABSTRACT Modelling the drop distance using the Archimedes number
is proposed for trajectory control of air jets into a ventilated
airspace. The term&quot;jet drop distance&quot;, defined as the
horizontal distance from the inlet to the point where the jet
reaches the occupational zone, is used to describe the status
of the jet. The models are functions of the inlet Archimedes number,
the inlet opening hydraulic diameter and the inlet height above
the floor. Experiments on non-isothermal jets were conducted for
modeling the drop distance. A inlet, with a bottom hinged flap
and a guiding plate on top, was used in the experiments. It is
shown that the jet drop distance depends on the inlet Archimedes
number, the inlet opening and the inlet configuration. The models
may be used to predict and control jet drop distances in a practical
on-line control process. Ins such a system, the jetdrop distance
is used as a criterion for control of trajectories, and desired
drop distance of jets may be controlled indirectly by regulating
the operating pressure and the inlet opening.

ABSTRACT The paper describes the moisture control strategy used
in the case of a multi-story office building located in a hot
humid climate and estimates the energy consumed to dehumidify
the ventilation air to avoid condensation. The results show that,
in order to achieve a comfortable and stable environment from
both thermal and humidity perspectives, the ventilation (and dehumidification)
system of the building should be operated 24 h/day. If high variations
in the relative humidity are acceptable, important energy savings
can be achieved by switching off the ventilation system at night.
When compared to an all-air system, the use of the hydronic radiant
system for conditioning in a hot humid climate provides similar
indoor comfort conditions and requires less energy and peak power
to operate.

ABSTRACT Most office buildings require cooling in winter, even
in such harsh climates as in Canada. This is mainly due to internal
heat generation caused by lighting, computers, fax machines, occupants,
and so on. This paper reports the result of a simulation study
to investigate the feasibility of off-hour accelerated ventilation
in a real office building in order to reduce the air conditioning
energy consumption while maintaining acceptable indoor environment
conditions. A multi-story building equipped with mechanical system
is designed to be employed in either day normal or night accelerated
ventilation (free-cooling) mode. The study first involved integrating
a multi-zone air flow model, COMVEN, with the multizone thermal
model from TRNSYS. The results from the protection level and interzonal
air-flow point of view show that a coupled air-flow/thermal model
must be used. Finally, simulations were done to evaluate the energy
savings when the off-hour accelerated ventilation technique is
used while still respecting physical constraints, such as spatial
geometry and indoor air environment conditions.

ABSTRACT Great efforts have been made on to predict the air flow
pattern in barns with negatively pressured ventilation systems.
Some of the studies use the traditional air jet theory, and some
use CFD modelling. It is assumed that all the fresh air is supplied
through the inlets, ie. the structure is airtight. This is opposite
of real life conditions, where air leakages always occur. This
paper presents a description of air leakages and their impact
on the supply air jet momentum from the inlets. The results show
that at decreasing air flow rates, the air leakage will play an
increasing role on the supply air jet momentum. If the leakage
is not taken into account, serious errors may occur in predicting
the air flow patterns in a room.

ABSTRACT This study is directed at understanding the exchange
flow through a single top vent in an atrium-type of compartment
via fire trails, and obtaining fundamental knowledge of physical
mechanism necessary to develop a comprehensive atrium fire model.
This study focuses on the supply air and pressure boundary conditions
required to prevent flow entering thorough the top vent from outside
of the compartment, when the supply air into the compartment is
limited. A series of experiments were conducted in a scaled cubical
compartment with a natural gas burned as a heat source. Under
various heat release rates with different forced air supply, the
criteria distinguishing the flow between bi-directional flow and
unidirectional flow were examined. The result indicates that the
criteria can be characterized by dimensionless parameters of the
Froude Number and/or the pressure difference between inside and
outside of the compartment.

ABSTRACT Field measurements of air flow patterns and stryrene
concentration distribution were carried out in a reinforced plastic
factory hall during normal production conditions. The purpose
was to produce detailed results which can be compared to CFD-simulations.
Measuring equipment included ultrasonic and omnidirectional velocity
sensors and an infrared gas analyser. The equipment was installed
in a measurement carriage which was then traversed in the hall.
The flow pattern of the supply air device was measured in laboratory.
The results of measured cross-sections were presented as contour
diagrams and vector plots. Vectorial velocity results can be compared
directly with CDF-simulations, whereas the comparison with omnidirectional
results is more complicated. The comparison of predicted and measured
concentration levels is difficult because of the spatial and temporal
variation of contaminant sources.

ABSTRACT Visual observation in a slot-ventilated enclosure (inlet
along one side and exhaust through the ceiling) under isothermal
conditions showed a predictable rotational airflow. This was easier
to see and document with a 1/10 scale model of the building then
in the full scale room. The visual observations were video taped
in both the 1/10 and full scale units. These subjective observations
were quantified by air velocity measurements taken at corresponding
locations in the 1/10 and full scale units. Initial results indicate
similar velocities near the floor of the rooms and in certain
flow regimes. Considerable differences exist between the two scaled
rooms near the air inlet zones, especially where the air jet is
changing directions. This suggest that &quot;scaling factors&quot;
may need to be altered in different sections of the ventilated
space for the conditions of a livestock (pig) housing building.

ABSTRACT Ventilation in large enclosures is of special interest
for two main reasons: they have a large volume and a large envelope
area, and the physical properties of the air cannot be assumed
as homogeneous within the enclosure. These two reasons are also
the two main difficulties encountered when measuring ventilation
in large enclosures. The considered methods are related to air
tightness, ventilation performance, visualisation of air movement
and temperature fields. After a shore review of problems found
in measuring ventilation performance of large enclosures, the
contribution presents a description of the methods developed within
the International Energy Agency Energy - Conservation in Buildings
and Community Systems - Annex 26 research program the project.

ABSTRACT A number of infiltration models have been developed to
calculate air flow related energy losses and the resulting flow
distribution in both single-zone and multizone buildings. The
latest development in infiltration modeling is the COMIS model,
COMIS can be used as a stand-alone infiltration model with input
and output features or as an infiltration module for thermal building
simulation programs. The Executive Committee of International
Energy Agency`s Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community
Systems program adopted a working group on multizone air flow
modeling. The objective of this annex is to study physical phenomena
causing air flow and pollutant transport (eg. Moisture) in multizone
buildings, to develop modules to be integrated in the multizone
air flow modeling system, and to evaluate the program. Annex 23
officially ends in Summer 1996. At the end of the annex COMIS
3.0, which is a combination of the simulation model and the Intelligent
System Environment, as well as the reports describing the evaluation
exercise will be available.

ABSTRACT COMIS V3.0 is a brand new simulation environment that
has been developed within the frame work of IEA/ECB Annex 23.
To our knowledge this is the first time that one of the Annexes
of IEA/ECB produces as its main result a validated software not
only designed for research laboratories but also usable in engineering
and consulting companies. Annex 23-subtask 1 aimed to develop
a multizone air flow modelling system (COMIS) encapsulated in
a Simulation Environment (in order to facilitate access and use
of COMIS). An additional goal was to demonstrate the coupling
of COMIS with building Energy Performance Simulation codes such
as TRNSYS. In this paper we present the main results of IEA/ECB
Annex 23-Subtask 1 in terms of capabilities of COMIS3.0, way of
running COMIS 3.0 and how it can be used in tandem with thermal
simulation codes.

ABSTRACT A careful evaluation of the multizone nodal air flow
simulation code COMIS was performed. The purpose of the evaluation
of a computer code is to assess its limits of validity (ie. to
verify its validity within some limits) and to improve its use
ability. Evaluation is an alternative to validation since validation
can never actually be achieved. The steps of this evaluation are
analytical evaluation, comparison with experimental data and user
sensitivity. The methods used are described and the result of
the evaluation is presented. The conclusion addresses the needed

ABSTRACT In this paper, we present new results on the effects
of aeraulic phenomena on energy consumption and comfort for typical
housing using a building energy simulation software (Clim2000),
The presented results are for different heating scenario with
air inlets located in occupation rooms (living room, room 1,2
and 3) and outlets are set up in service rooms (bathroom, toilet,
kitchen). Radiant phenomena and solar radiation through windows
are also taken into account in the modelling. All simulations
use data from the TRAPPES weather station (located near PARIS)
and are undertaken for a period of seven months, corresponding
to the heating season in France. The paper presents a comparison
of energy consumption and temperature field distribution for different
configurations (mono-zone, bizone, and multizone). On the basis
of multi-zone configuration simulations, we could assess the air
distribution in the house. This enabled us to optimize operating
mode of the heaters in each room of the house, so that minimum
energy consumption and maximum comfort according to distribution
of the temperature field could be achieved.

ABSTRACT The multi-chamber airflow measurement method is currently
an interesting research theme from the theoretical standpoint
of multivariable input/output and optimal systems. The author
has deduced a theory for system parameter identification based
on the thermal network model, and also developed a multi-chamber
airflow measurement system as an application. The present paper
describes the laboratory verification experiment and the error
analysis of the field measurement conducted in an apartment house.
This paper also investigates the effect of nonnegative constraints
in the system identification calculation period and the effect
of dividing zones onto the precision. The result shows that the
root Mean Square provides a useful index for the error analysis
also shows that the nonnegative least squares method is more precise.

ABSTRACT The influence of ventilation types in rooms, where its
occupant is the main source of heat and ventilation objects, was
examined using small water tanks. The Reynolds numbers of the
object rooms and the water tanks were equalized to simulate the
ventilation flow pattern in the tanks to its in the object rooms.
The Grashof numbers of a heated body model and an occupant were
also equalized to simulate the free convection in the water tanks
to the object rooms. The examined flow types were upward- and
downward-flows. A jet and diffuser inlets were examined in both
of the types. Of the four ventilation systems, stratifications
of the body heat and effluents were observed in the upper part
of the tank only in the upward diffused flow. The direct reach
of the fresh supply to the outlet was blocked by the stratification,
and the bypass factor of this ventilation showed negative values.
However, the stratification was broken when the Reynolds number
of the ventilation exceeded 390. Only when the stratification
was held, the efficiency of the heat and effluent evacuation was
high.

ABSTRACT The influence of the variation of the thermal boundary
conditions on the global Air Change Efficiency of a balanced mechanical
ventilation system in a test room was experimentally evaluated
by means of the &quot;step-down&quot; tracer gas technique. The
tracer gas concentration has been monitored in 25 to 100 sampling
points inside the test room. The experiments were performed under
isothermal condition, varying the air supply temperature respect
to the walls and varying the surface temperature of a wall respect
to the other walls and the supply air simulating both heating
and cooling situation. Changing the position of the outlet grid
two different configurations of the ventilation system were tested.
The nominal velocity of supply air varied between 0.04 and 0.11
m/s, corresponding to a range from 1 to 3 ach, and the temperature
differences varied from 0.7 to 5oC. Results are presented in terms
of variation of global Air Change Efficiency us, the Archimedes
number whose values were in the range 0 to 181. They show that
Archimedes number has, especially in the cooling situation, a
clear influence on the Air Change Efficiency.

ABSTRACT High contents of organic dust in pig and poultry buildings
have shown to cause health problems (primarily respiratory diseases)
in both people and animals. Dust in barns derives from feed, dried
faecal matter, bedding, animal scurf, mites, bacteria, fungi and
other organic and inorganic particles. Multi-point dust generation
occurs at feeders, animals and surfaces of the room and the fixtures.
Dust particles are transported by the air current which is affected
by the ventilation system and the thermal and geometrical conditions
in the room. some particles are exhausted from the building, and
the others settle on the surfaces. A research team at Research
Centre Bygholm in Denmark has developed experimental techniques
for full-scale simulation of dust dispersion in ventilated air
spaces. An important part of the experimental set-up is the high
mass flow dust generation system which can simulate the dust levels
found in a real livestock building. A multi-point dust generator
system has been built and tested. The system consists of a modified
rotating-table dust generator and copper tubing for transport
of dust to desired dust ejection sites. A commercially available
powder similar to real barn dust for use in the generation system
is being investigated. The possibility to create a very high dust
concentration is a unique aspect of this full-scale simulation
set-up. Research Centre Bygholm plans to use this facility to
determine fundamental information such as dust settling rates
to validate mathematical models of dust transport and to test
dust suppression techniques.

ABSTRACT One of the most important factors contributing to indoor
air quality is the amount of fresh air that needs to be provided
in buildings for occupants undergoing work in varying circumstances.
Standards in Europe and America attempt to define the amount of
fresh air per person, but the data shows that there is a great
variation between the criteria used by various countries. One
conclusion is that there may be no fixed figure, but rather a
variable amount of fresh air required to deal with varying circumstances.
For many years the criterion has been that the CO2 content should
be below 1000ppm, but this along as a criterion is inadequate.
This project attempts to use chromatography for analysing air
samples taken in four rooms. Questionnaires have been administered
in the spaces and an attempt has been made to correlate the objective
and subjective measures. Chromatography is a measurement technique
that has been used for many years in food sciences for studying
tastes and fragrances. This is a pilot project and so there has
been limited time to take samples and survey of occupants, but
it has shown that this technique is worthwhile developing and
studying in more detail.

ABSTRACT To investigate the performance of turbulence models in
the numerical simulation of recirculating ventilation flows, comparisons
have been made for three types of two-equation models. A modified
model recently proposed by the authors has been introduced and
implemented. All the models are applied with the all-function
method. When using the model, an extended-to-wall method is also
used. Two typical recirculating flows are calculated: the separated
flow behind a backward-facing step with a large expansion ratio
relevant to room ventilation; and the wall-jet-induced flow in
a two-dimensional ventilation enclosure. The predictions are compared
with experimental data. The performance of the models is discussed.
The modified model is shown to be an attractive alternative to
the initial model.

ABSTRACT We have done Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of the flow
in a three-dimensional ventilated room. A finite volume method
is used with a collocated grid arrangement. The momentum equations
are solved with an explicit method using central differencing
for all terms. The pressure is obtained from a Poisson equation,
which is solved with a conjugate gradient method. For the discretization
in time we use the Adam-Bashfourth scheme, which is second-order
accurate. When using LES, the time-dependent three-dimensional
momentum and continuity are solved. A subgrid turbulence model
is used to model the turbulent scales which are smaller than the
cells. We have used two different subgrid models: the traditional
Smagorinsky model, and the dynamic model of Germano. Instead of
the traditional time averaging, the equations when using LEA are
filtered in space. With LES we get much more information than
when using traditional time averaged turbulence models, since
we are resolving most of the turbulence. It is found that instantaneous
fluctuations are very large. For example, in the region of the
wall jet below the ceiling where the time averaged velocity is
typically 0.5, the instantaneous velocity fluctuates between 0.3
and 0.8.

ABSTRACT As the flow inside livestock buildings is highly time-dependent,
Reynolds-averaged turbulence maybe inadequate as they are based
on time-averaging. As a consequence, Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
methodology employing a space-averaging procedure is adapted.
In the present work LES is used for the airflow inside a room.
As base model the subgrid term is computed by the Smagorinsky
model using different variants regarding near wall-damping and
wall-boundary conditions. Preliminary comparative results are
also given for dynamic and mixed-scale subgrid scale models. The
numerical methods used were those implemented in the commercial
general-purpose finite-volume CFD-code, CFDS-Flow3d and LESROOM,
which is a staggered grid finite difference code. The results
are compared with the standard K-e model, the low-Reynolds number
model and a renormalization group model for the airflow in the
three-dimensional IEA, Annex 20 test case.

ABSTRACT A new system of heating and cooling which diffuses air
through knitted textile fabric stretched to form a false ceiling
is studied using both numerical simulation and experimental facilities.
As shown in figure 1 the conditioned air flows through the void
(8cm) between the fixed ceiling and the impermeable part of the
fabric before diffusing into the room through the permeable part
of the fabric. A CFD code using the finite volume method of solution
has been extended to allow the coupling of conductive and radiant
heat transfers at the wall with the air flow in the room. Comparison
with experimental results obtained for a full-scale room is provided.
Numerical as well as experimental studies allow us to draw conclusions
as to the excellent performance of the &quot;Diffusion Ceiling&quot;
as far as thermal comfort is concerned.

ABSTRACT The goal of this study is to gain and show confidence
in the CFD code EOL-3D for routine applications. In this prospect,
we performed a triple study based on the same industrial site
of a painting area: evaluation of free low-velocity air supply
with experiment on a scale model, on site measurements with a
jet-like air supply diffuser, numerical simulation of both configurations.
We are able to confront measurements and calculation results in
order to test the EOL-3D CFD code and we raise the question of
the uncertainty of numerical simulation versus experiment. Our
method leads to acceptable uncertainty indices considering ventilation
applications. Finally, the applicability of CFD modelling to practical
cases is confirmed by our on site measurements in the painting
area. Main features of the flow according to occupational safety
are well predicted by simulation.

presented. The influence of the thermal mass and ventilation opening
areas for both comfort and energy consumption is discussed. Dynamical
thermal simulations are performed over a whole year, and the energy
consumption for both ventilation and space heating is taken into
account. This allows to compare the energy consumption of the
space with either natural or mechanical ventilation using the
same conditions of occupancy and climate. For the case of mechanical

ABSTRACT In the large courtyard of high-rise residential buildings,
the exhaust from the kitchen, and the gas water heater, is sometimes
discharged into the public corridors, which can pollute the air.
The exhaust heat caused the stack effect, so the outdoor air flows
through the openings at the bottom of the courtyard to the top.
The purpose of this study is to describe these ventilation characteristics
and to predict the airflow rate for removing the pollutants. Firstly,
model experiments were conducted to know the temperature distribution
and airflow rates. The result showed that the characteristics
are influenced by the size of the bottom opening area and the
position of heat sources. Secondly, the comparison between mathematical
calculation and experimental data were nearly in agreement, except
for some inconsistencies at the top of the courtyard. This was
due to the air down flow, when the bottom opening area was not
large enough.

ABSTRACT A unique evaluation and subsequent rectification of the
air distribution system for the Opera Theatre and Concert Hall
at the Sydney Opera House have been recently carried out. Like
most auditoriums of that era, conditioned air is supplied at ceiling
level and returned at floor level. From the outset the halls experienced
significant variations in zone conditions resulting in patron
complaints. Several previous attempts to rectify the problem failed
to achieve required results. Our methodology involved measurement
and plotting of return air quantities under each seat formulating
a return air chart. This provided valuable air flow data and also
revealed design constraints that needed addressing. Balancing
of the return air was then used to force an even distribution
of supply air at seating level across the hall. The final result
is the achievement of a far superior comfort level with uniformity
in temperature and air flow readings.

ABSTRACT This paper presents results of the application of three
different thermal analysis computer programs to Gjovik Olympic
Mountain Hall. Gjovik Mountain Hall is an underground rock cavern
used for ice-hockey, exhibitions, concerts, etc. which can accommodate
5800 spectators. Measurements in the hall are carried out, with
the intention of using the results to verify design tools for
the prediction of indoor climate and HVAC energy consumption.
Continuous measurements have been taken of air flow rates and
air temperatures, for one year. The data has been collected from
Building Management System (BMS). The first computer program,
Fres, was used for design energy calculations. Fres is a building
simulation program for predicting heating, cooling and ventilation
energy consumption. A building can contain one or several rooms
with arbitrary number of walls and windows between them. The temperature
profile of walls is solved with a one-dimensional Finite Difference
method. The second program, LescoCool, is a simple zonal model.
The model couples ventilation heat flow and the thermal response
of the walls assuming i) displacement ventilation ii) a convective
heat transfer coefficient iii) semi-finite wall thermal response
iv) thermal equilibrium for radiative heat gain. The wall thermal
response of the hall can be characterised with a single parameter,
the mean thermal effusivity. The parameters determining these
design parameters (including the wall surface area covered by
acoustic panels) are discussed. Thirdly, measurements have been
compared with the program RockHall, which is a 2 dimensional program
for calculating conduction and heat fluxes through surfaces and
heat exchange between surfaces. This program is developed specially
for rock halls and is the most detailed of the three candidates.

ABSTRACT In first part of fire, when smoke expel can be dominating,
fast operating of the fire ventilation is required. In industrial,
airtight hall, after turning on outlet ventilators, an underpressure
appears. Larger amount of outdoor air will get inside. To ensure
proper smoke removal process, outdoor air flows must be properly
directed. It is necessary to design appropriate air inlets, mounted
inside the hall. Resigning of control over indoor airflow can
lead to smoke spread in whole room and decrease efficiency of
life-saving activities. Problems of air movement in large capacity
room in case of fire ventilation operation are presented in this
paper.

ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to clear the air flow pattern
caused by wind and to propose a predicting method for air flow
rate through a void space vertically penetrating the central portion
of a building from its base to top. And the method is required
simplicity as regarding cost and time. The present paper shows
results of two investigations. The first is to analyze air flow
patterns in void space by means of flow visualization technique
in wind tunnel. The result indicates that the air flow pattern
was characterized by the wind direction and the height of a heliport
as a roof of the void space. The second is to calculate the air
flow rate through the void space utilizing simplified model. The
calculated results were compared with experimental results obtained
by the wind tunnel. Both results agreed well.

ABSTRACT For thermal comfort applications, an office air distribution
system should introduce air into a room such that the resulting
air speed and temperature distribution within the occupied zone
is as uniform as possible to minimise areas of high velocity and
to prevent the occurrence of steep temperature gradients. When
considering air-conditioned offices, the main driving flows are
the cold air jet and the plumes created by internal heat loads.
So, in order to study thermal comfort in air-conditioned offices,
laws to describe this type of driving flows and specially for
the cold air jet have to be provided. The purpose of this experimental
work is to analyse the cold air jet characteristics and to attempt
to rely them with the indoor air-thermoconvective field.

ABSTRACT A PIV system to measure airflow distribution through
the pattern tracking on VTR images visualized with smoke or mist
particles are presented. Speeding up of the pattern tracking by
using successive abandonment through F-inspection make it possible
to extract many vectors at different times on multiple points.
Mistracked vectors can be eliminated adequately by post processing
them. Although the usage of reduced search area by predicting
velocity vectors, coupled with the successive abandonment cannot
reduce computation time significantly, it brings the increase
of extracted vectors. Two examples of application to measure a
time average velocity field of fluctuating airflow and a temporal
variation of velocity filed which varies periodically are presented.
They are measured adequately by using our PIV system.

ABSTRACT Optimisation of a displacement ventilation system, and
control of system operation, require accurate modelling of the
aeraulic and thermal phenomena which contribute to the establishment
or destruction of thermal stratification in the room ventilated.
This fine analysis is carried out on typical, although artificially
simplified configurations, in order to achieve optimum control
of the boundary conditions of the phenomena studied. It is based
on an experimental mock-up, representing a room equipped with
a displacement ventilation system, operated by the Poitiers Thermal
Studies Laboratory. We propose two types of simplified model for
evaluation of mean temperature in the room. The level of precision
for each model differs according to requirements. The first is
a zonal model, based on division of the room into two superimposed
regions, with the hot air floating above the fresh air. The plume
is analysed using Zukosky correlations. Boundary layer flows along
the vertical wall surfaces are modelled by means of Jaluria correlations.
According to their directions and mean temperatures, the parietal
flows feed a third zone occurring either below the cold zone,
above the hot zone, or between the two. The temperature gradient
in the room is integrated for modelling the boundary layers. The
numerical result obtained concord well with experimental measurements,
and provide a correct representation of mean temperatures in each
zone. We then propose a one-dimensional model for finer representation
of the thermal gradient in the room. According to analysis of
experimental results, the isotherms are all horizontal inside
the cavity. We have also developed elementary models (formal types)
on this basis, integrated in the CLIM2000 Building Energy Simulation
Tool. This means that the elementary models can be connected to
other components or phenomena (wall surfaces, solar input, radiation,
scenarios involving occupation or operation etc), for global representation
of a building equipped with a displacement ventilation system.

ABSTRACT In Building K of the Head Office in Tokyo, environmental
measurements were carried out during periods of cooling and heating
in spaces occupied by 1) a large conference room and 2) a housing
information service. Both spaces are serviced by an air conditioning
system that employs displacement ventilation. In addition, for
the large conference room, a numerical simulation was performed
for a cooling period using the same conditions as those for the
measurements. Based on a comparison of the simulation and measurement
result, the ventilation efficiency was calculated. The purpose
of these measurements was to determine if the premises serviced
by the air conditioning system have a comfortable thermal environment
with neither temperature fluctuations nor drafts. An additional
purpose was to verify that the ventilation was at a comfortable
level. This was done through calculation of the ventilation efficiency
by means of a numerical analysis based on three-dimensional turbulent
flow, as the efficiency could not be determined by actual measurements.
A displacement ventilation system blows out air at or somewhat
below room temperature near floor level. It is a system of stratified
air conditioning that exploits the difference in specific gravity
that arises from the difference between the temperature of the
air being blown out and room temperature. This system is widely
used primarily in northern Europe. But if the system were reproduced
in Japan as is, people might not be completely satisfied. The
reasons for that are as follows: Summers in Japan are hotter and
more humid than those in northern Europe; and since winters in
northern Europe are extremely cold, buildings are better insulated
and more air-tight then those in Japan. Moreover, there are other
considerations, such as the fact that the temperature at which
people feel most conformable is lower for Westerners than for
Japanese. That being the case, various measures are being devised
to ensure that Japanese people feel comfortable. Interest in this
system has been rising in Japan recently, but projects in which
it has actually been used are extremely rare. The present project
is the first time that this system has been seriously implemented
in Japan. That makes the environmental measurement and numerical
simulation results in this report quite valuable; and they will
undoubtedly be very useful to future projects that employ a system
of stratified air conditioning.

ABSTRACT This paper describes the errors due to several factors
considered to effect on the ventilation effectiveness, and evaluates
the ventilation performance by the air change efficiency and the
local air change index for basic ventilation systems using a full
scale room model. As a result of the sensitivity analysis for
the numerical integration of air change efficiency using a simple
ventilation model, it should take four times as long as the nominal
time constant and less then three minutes for the time lag to
obtain the ventilation efficiency within the 10 percent error.

ABSTRACT Measurement of the age of air is useful for identifying
the distribution of outdoor air among rooms. However, the reliability
of such measurement is still insufficient in filed tests. This
paper deals with methods of measuring the age of air in a test
house with three different types of ventilation systems, namely,
a mechanical supply and exhaust system with and without return
air, and a mechanical exhaust system. The purpose of this study
is to examine the following items: 1) the effect of ventilation
airflow rate on measurement results, 2) the reproducibility of
measurement results, 3) the difference of results between the
step-up and step-down methods, 4) Comparison of results for three
different types of ventilation systems.

ABSTRACT An investigation was performed through model experiment
and numerical simulation into the relation between air change
efficiency and the outlet/return-intake configuration employed
under ventilation or heating conditions. The results revealed
as follows: 1) During ventilation operation, the local air change
indices are in the range of 0.9 - 1.2 in every case, and there
is little difference of values amount outlet-return-intake configurations.
2) During heating operation, the local air change indices differ
largely according to the configuration of the outlet/return-intake
system. In the case of a ceiling outlet-ceiling return-intake
configuration, the mean local air change index is approximately
0.3; a very low value compared with that found in other cases.
3) In cases employing a floor outlet system, the occupied zone
air change indices are 0.8 - 0.9, showing nearly complete diffusion,
regardless of the return-intake position, even during heating
operation. 4) The results of numerical simulation and the model
experiment coincide well with each other.

ABSTRACT Indoor spaces are supposed to offer occupants adequate
climate. That is, air quality and thermal comfort according to
specifications given in regulations or standards or what is decided
in order to achieve enhanced occupant productivity. One issue
of increasing importance, is to accomplish the specified criteria
at a minimum use of energy. Ventilation, heating and cooling must
therefore be designed with regard to being efficient as well as
effective. The potential for energy saving design is present for
large rooms. Effective and efficient climatization of indoor spaces
has the best chance for success when the design work is carried
out in a logical, subsequent manner with increasing detail richness
towards final design, and in the framework of a design procedure.
A framework for a design procedure is suggested, and ventilation
and energy efficiency indices for design assessment are reviewed.
An energy efficiency index is developed and discussed for a large-enclosure
with an HVAC system.

Using a finite dosing period with the pulse method and considering

ABSTRACT The main problems with the application of the pulse method
are high curvatures and low signal-to-noise ratios making it difficult
to accurately resolve the local concentration curves. The reason
for this is the demand of a dosing period being negligibly small
in comparison with the nominal time-constant of the room. From
a single-zone-model an analytical relation was derived that takes
finite dosing periods into account and hence extends the applicability
of the pulse method. To determine the air exchange efficiency
by means of the step-up, the step-down or the pulse method definite
step changes of the concentration of a tracer gas at the supply
inlet are necessary. If the HVAC-System runs in recirculation
mode, it would not be possible to maintain this boundary condition.
To overcome this problem an analytical relation was derived for
a single room with multiple supply inlets in recirculation mode.

ABSTRACT When the air flow through a ventilated room is increased,
the degree of ventilation also increases according to the mass
balance. It is shown here, however, that the air change efficiency
in the room can change when the ventilation flow rate changes.
This phenomenon causes unexpected variations in the ventilation
process, whose main purpose is to renew the room air and continuously
transport contaminants out of the room. Measurements and numerical
simulations are used to find a relation between the selected ventilation
flow rate and the estimated air change efficiency. The results
are discussed and reasons for the variations are found by analyzing
room air flow patterns at different Reynolds numbers.

ABSTRACT The concept of Kato and Murakami of contribution ratio
of a supply opening or an exhaust opening are extended in this
paper to other types of boundaries and other parts of the flow
domain. Upwind and downwind contribution ratios are distinguished.
The contribution ratio, the age and residual life time of air
are considered as &quot;transportable&quot; quantities as there
exists a hidden analogy between the governing equations of these
quantities and the governing equation of contaminant from the
point of view of numerical computations. This allows the generalisation
of any conventional CFD code to be applied for predicting the
contribution ratios and sojourn time scales. Some illustrations
of practical interest are given from the numerical computations.

The design of ventilation systems of large enclosures with unconfined

ABSTRACT Indoor air quality of large enclosures containing unconfined
pollutant sources is a really challenging problem. Local capture
ventilation systems cannot be used because the contaminant source
is either too large or even moving; available design principles
for general ventilation systems are not very often applicable
either, because they generally would lead to enormous air flowrates.
It is the purpose of this paper to tackle this problem by using
computational fluid dynamics methods. Two practical examples chosen
in the domain of occupational health are presented. The first
case concerns the ventilation of underground building sites of
car parks. Here pollution produced by the earth movers is made
of dust and diesel engines exhaust gases. In the second example
a ventilated tunnel is used to protect the occupied zone of a
large workshop from styrene vapours produced by the manufacturing
of large fiber glass reinforced plastic pipes. For every example
several ventilation strategies are tested, by performing numerical
simulations of the resulting air and pollutants flow fields. In
the second application a parametric study is carried out to optimise
the design of the tunnel. Both cases have already been successfully
implemented and tested on sites. All computer simulations are
performed with the EOL-3D software developed at INRS. This paper
shows that CFD is a real design tool for ventilation systems in
complex industrial situations.

ABSTRACT In many applications the 3-D distribution of temperature
in an imperfectly mixed ventilated air space is determined by
the air mass transport or the flow pattern. A grey box model hase
been developed to predict the dynamic behavior of the 3-D distribution
of temperature to non-linear variations of the ventilation rate
V and heat supply Q (Watt) as control inputs. In the grey box
model physical laws are combined with a mathematical identification
procedure. Every parameter has a physical meaning which can be
interpreted in relation to the air flow pattern. In a laboratory
test installation 100 experiments were performed to identify the
model parameters in function of the ventilation rate and the heat
supply as control inputs. After the identification procedure five
validation experiments were performed in which the ventilation
rate was varied randomly between 80 and 300m3/h and in which the
heat supply was set to a constant level of 0 or 400 Watt. From
all these validation experiments the model was found to predict
temperature with a mean square error of 0.3C.

ABSTRACT Two-dimensional, isothermal full-scale experiments and
CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations are used to investigate
the influence of obstacles in the occupied zones. The shape of
the vertical velocity profiles, the maximum velocities in the
occupied zone, the velocity decay through the room, and the momentum
flow are investigated. It is found that the maximum velocity in
the occupied zone, and the velocity level in the entire room decrease
when obstacles are present in the room. The velocity profile changes
shape and the maximum velocity in the lower part of the room is
located higher above the floor than in the empty room. It is found
that the obstacles influence the flow in the entire room, and
because the obstacles not only redistribute the velocity profile
but also decrease the overall velocity level in the room the momentum
flow is reduced.

heights in the atrium and outside are monitored throughout the
year by the building control system. In addition, velocity profiles
in the occupied zone and the airleakage characteristics of the
whole atrium have been measured. Simple models for downdraft along
cold glazings and natural ventilation in summer, and complex models
involving computational fluid dynamics, are applied and compared

ABSTRACT This paper describes research into the flow and stratification
in naturally ventilated rooms containing either point sources
of heat or a distributed source of heat on one vertical wall.
Plumes from point sources on the floor of the room with vents
at the top and bottom produce a vertical density profile consisting
of several distinct, fully mixed layers. The paper includes a
summary of a theoretical model that predicts the depths and densities
of these layers. The positions of the interfaces between the layers
are found to be function only of the effective area, A, of the
enclosure openings the height of the enclosure, H, and the ratios
of the strengths of the two sources of heat. The theoretical approach
has been validated using water-filled scale models. In the case
where one wall of the room is uniformly heated a multiple-layer
stratification also develops.

ABSTRACT Based on the equations for mass balance, energy conservation
and vertical momentum and on the modified Bernouilli equation,
a set of formulas is derived for air velocities, temperature differences
and ventilation capacities in relation to opening areas, net heat
input, and building geometry. The validity of the formulas is
discussed in relation to temperature stratification, position
of the neutral plane, and the orientation of the openings. Further,
specific topics are discussed concerning air velocity and ventilation
capacity as affected by the opening area ratio (ie. inlet area/outlet
area), optimum opening area ratio, and finally the size of required
opening area related to required ventilation capacity or required
temperature difference. The set of formulas constitutes an easy-to-use
design method that can be programmed as an independent computer
program or integrated into a building energy analysis tool. Besides,
the formulas are well suited for analytical purposes.

ABSTRACT It has been impossible to predict the air change rate
of a room with a single opening exposed to natural wind by the
pressure differences generated by the wind. In order to establish
the simple method to predict the airflow rate through a single
opening, some experiments were conducted with a cubic model enclosure
containing a single opening in a wind tunnel. Under several conditions
of wind velocity, wind direction and approaching flow, characteristics
of local airflow in the vicinity of opening and airflow rate through
an opening were measured. through investigations, it is found
that the airflow rate is in proportion to local mean velocity
in the vicinity of the opening. In conclusion, the ultimate equation
for predicting the air flow rate of a room with a single opening
exposed to natural wind was presented in this paper.

ABSTRACT This paper describes an innovative study in which small-scale
laboratory experiments and simple theoretical models examine natural
ventilation by the combined effects of stack and wind and are
used to predict the airflow and temperature stratification within
an enclosure under a wide range of climatic conditions. In the
present experiments a Perspex tank of rectangular cross-section
is suspended in a flume. The flume produces a controllable, steady
horizontal flow which is used to model the wind. A number of openings
in the tank both at high/low levels and on windward/leeward faces
allow a wide range of generic ventilation flows to be examined.
In this paper two main ventilation flows have been identified:
i) those where the buoyancy and wind forces reinforce one another
and ii) those where the buoyancy and wind forces oppose one another.
The experiments have shown that the type of ventilation flow observed,
ie. whether displacement or mixing, is critically dependent upon
the relative magnitudes of the wind and buoyancy forces as well
as upon the size and location of the openings. Some of the implications
of the flows to the natural ventilation of enclosures are discussed.

ABSTRACT This case study comprises a monitoring programme as well
as a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a natural
ventilated atrium. The purpose has been to analyse the performance
of a typical natural ventilation system in Denmark under both
summer and winter conditions. The monitoring programme consisted
of measurements in two short-term periods under summer and winter
conditions, respectively. Vertical temperature distribution, surface
temperatures, air change rates and thermal comfort conditions
were measured. CFD simulations were carried out in the same cases.
The influence of the inlet opening position and the solar radiation
on thermal comfort and ventilation capacity were also investigated.
The results showed a well working natural ventilation system under
both winter and summer conditions. The results also showed that
CFD simulation was a useful tool to predict the performance of
the system.

ABSTRACT Many buildings in Japan are furnished with a large stairwell
in the centre, called &quot;void&quot;. Gas water heaters are
often installed in the void, consuming the air inside and discharging
the exhaust gas into the void. The behaviour of the exhaust gas
in the void space has become a great concern. Model experiment
and three dimensional CFD have been conducted to investigate,
in detail, flow characteristics in the void space. The study selects
a simple rectangular void space which accommodates gas water heaters
discharging exhaust gas from the corners. Good agreement has been
obtained between the CFD results and experimental data regarding
the velocity distribution at the top of the void, thereby validating
the CFD method employing the k-e model of turbulence. Detailed
consideration has been made to identify the flow field in the
void space by using the CFD results.

ABSTRACT An enclosing fence around a single unit house often gives
strong influence on the indoor airflow caused by cross-ventilation.
The influence of fences on cross-ventilation is examined by CFD
(Computational Fluid Dynamics) in this paper. The calculation
area of numerical simulations of cross-ventilation should have
not only the indoor space but also the surrounding outdoor space
of a house to analyze the airflow continuously. The heights of
fences and the distances between fences and a model house are
used as parameters of simulation models. The results of the numerical
simulations for the model houses with the fences are compared
each other and with that of the model house without the fence.
When the fence is higher, the indoor airflow pattern greatly changed
and the cross-ventilation rate decreases. However, the distance
between the fence and the model house has little influence on
both the indoor airflow pattern and the cross-ventilation rate.

ABSTRACT Airflow within an apartment is important for the performance
in terms of providing thermal comfort. Cross-ventilation is the
most effective cooling method against the hot-humid climate. This
paper aims to study impact of partition walls on air velocity
and air distribution in apartments with cross-ventilation. Airflow
patterns and velocities in six apartments, constructed in southern
China, have been studied. A commercial program Flovent, based
on Computational Fluid Dynamics, is used for simulations. The
results of the study have indicated that the different modification
of internal walls designed by users create different airflow patterns
within the same configuration of the apartments. They have a significant
influence on internal air distribution. In one bedroom ventilation
is bad, but if ventilated holes are added to the partition wall
of the room, ventilation within the room could be improved.

is a cubic box with two relatively large windows on the opposite

patterns, ventilation rates and pressure losses at the windows
by the depth of the windows are examined from the results of the
numerical simulations, which shows the possibility and the necessity

multi-family building are presented in the paper. For this purpose,
the simulation of retrofitting the building by means of insulating
external walls and windows leakages was carried out. Based on
the numerical simulations, analysis of ventilating air flows in
this multi-family building were carried out. Results of these
calculations were used as an input data for energetic audit of
this building. For this purpose, the TRNSYS program was used yielding
the total heat balance for the whole building. Analyses of the
total thermal load were shown for comparing the thermal comfort
in the separate flats and also for indicating the energy conservation
due to retrofitting.

ABSTRACT A 1:100 scale model of a house with a clear plastic roof
was placed in a boundary layer wind tunnel. Flow visualisation
using foam polystyrene beads was videotaped from above the model
for each of 16 compass-point wind directions. Miniature cylindrical
hot film anemometer probes were located at an equivalent of 1
metre above floor level in the living room, kitchen and bedrooms
from below the wind tunnel floor. A similar reference hot film
anemometer probe was mounted upstream from the model at a height
equivalent to 10m above ground level.

ABSTRACT Performance of displacement, underfloor, and ceiling
based air distribution systems were evaluated based on the age
of air, contaminant concentration, and thermal comfort. Measurements
to evaluate indoor environment were conducted in an office type
of chamber. In this experiment a thermal manikin was also used
to examine thermal comfort. The underfloor air conditioning system
was performed slightly better than the conventional ceiling diffuser
system in ventilation efficiency. for the displacement system
the local air change index at respiration zone turned out nearly
1.6, but a large vertical temperature difference was found with
low supply air volume, which might cause local discomfort.

ABSTRACT The vertical temperature gradient is normally given as
a linear temperature distribution between a minimum temperature
close to the floor and a maximum temperature close to the ceiling.
The minimum temperature can either be a constant fraction of a
load dependent difference or it can be connected to the volume
flow to the room. This paper describes a new model which takes
the different types of heat sources in the occupied zone as well
as the characteristic Archimedes number of the flow into account.
Full-scale experiments with different heat sources as: Distributed
heat sources, Sedentary persons, Ceiling light and a Point heat
source have been used in the development.

ABSTRACT In a room with displacement ventilation the temperature
gradient is of great interest as its size limits the use for this
type of ventilation. Simplified models for calculating the temperature
gradient in a room with no resulting heat transport through the
perimeter have earlier been presented. Complex multi-node models
including heat transfer through the walls have also been presented
in the literature, the use of these however require a small workstation.
This paper will present an extended model where the resulting
heat load removed by ventilation as well as the temperature gradient
in the room can be easily calculated in a spread sheet on a PC.
Solar radiation can be include in the heat balance as well as
the influence of the nature of the heat sources in the room.

ABSTRACT Conditions of two-zone air flow forming in rooms with
displacement ventilation were defined by measurement of temperature
and tracer gas concentration distribution in the plume and its
surrounding. Plumes above heat sources of different parameters
were simulated by means of special simulator. The measurements
were made at different flow rates of ventilating air and different
initial values of the plume parameters. The tests were carried
out in a test room of dimensions 2.0x2.4x2.0m. Those tests conditions
correspond to the conditions of the displacement ventilation model
known as &quot;filling box with a plume&quot;. Characteristics
of the boundary layer between the zones were defined and the way
of its position defining has been suggested.

ABSTRACT Displacement ventilation offers improved air quality
and reduced cooling costs relative to ventilation systems that
mix supply and room air. However, thermal stratification at high
internal loads can cause excessive variation of temperature with
height which violates thermal comfort requirements. A series of
experiments were performed in a geometrically similar scale model
of an open-plan office space. The model was filled with a gaseous
refrigerant to establish fluid-dynamic similitude by matching
the Reynolds, Archimedes and Prandtl numbers. Vertical temperature
profiles and flow patterns were recorded.
