<P>  According to studies published in the well respected British scientific journal, Lancet, the incidence of heart disease related to atherosclerosis, including coronary artery disease, in Greenlandic Eskimos is extremely low. From 1963 to 1967 only three cases of these diseases were reported in the entire Eskimo population of Greenland.  Moreover, not a single established case of diabetes is known to have been reported in the population of the Greenlandic Uhanak district. Since diabetes and heart disease affected literally millions of Americans in the  1980's and  1990's, the lack of heart disease in Eskimos and other societies has attracted the serious attention of many scientists around the world.</P>
<P>  The   food   of  the   Greenlandic   Eskimos consists largely of meat from whales, seals, sea birds and fish (usually halibut and salmon).  Needless to say, their food is extremely rich in protein and fat and low in carbohydrates, but it is extremely high in the Omega-3 Polyunsaturates EPA and DHA as contained in Life Plus EPA PLUS.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> EPA</H2>
<P>   Doctors have been saying for years that large amounts of fat in the diet can lead to heart disease and other disorders.  Why, therefore, can a group of people who consume such large amounts of protein and fat have such low incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease?  Until recently, scientists have been baffled by this important question. The new link in their chain of understanding now centers around a marine lipid concentrate, containing Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA).</P>
<P>  EPA is a direct source of an important substance called prostaglandin F3. Prostaglandin E3 is directly responsible for making blood platelets (cells which form a "plug" wherever an injury occurs) less sticky, thus leading to an easier flow of blood throughout out- bodies.  This natural antithrombotic "anti-clotting" effect of` EPA has been well researched. This means that EPA is intimately involved in bodily processes that inhibit  blood  clots  (obstructions  to  circulation), particularly in the small capillaries of the heart. When a small blood vessel is injured, platelets adhere to each other around the edges of the injury, forming a clot. This is a natural protective mechanism that prevents us from literally bleeding to death.</P>
<P>  However, when platelets in the blood become too sticky,  they  can  clump  abnormally  fast  and  too frequently.  This rapid and extensive platelet clumping can actually inhibit circulation and be a major contributor to heart and circulatory disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DHA</H2>
<P>  Of almost equal importance, but not as widely researched, is Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA).   It comprises a significant amount of the tissue, which makes up our brains as well as a large part of the retina of the eye.</P>
<P>  The average American diet is very low in fresh fish and derivatives of sea food that contain EPA and DHA. On the other hand, it is high in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats.  This kind of diet can lead to a serious deficiency in the raw materials necessary for proper platelet function in our blood stream.  Recent dietary studies suggest that marine lipid complexes that contain EPA and DHA can have a very significant effect on lowering unwanted "blood fats." They may prove to be extremely useful natural substances powerful enough to normalize the high cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are so extensive in our modern American population.</P>
<P>  Supplementing with EPA PLUS is a rational approach to naturally increasing the amount of Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Docosahexaenoic Acid in our daily diets. This product represents a significant advantage over other marine oils, which can supply a potentially toxic amount of Vitamins A and D, while supplying lower amounts of EPA and DHA factors.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE EPA PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is recommended to take one or two capsules with the two major meals each day.  Many individuals also take EPA PLUS with the third meal as well. It is wise to limit the amount of saturated fat in your diet and increase the amount of high quality cold water fish.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: One to two capsule two or three times per day with meals.</P>
