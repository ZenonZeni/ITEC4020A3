</H2>

<H3><A HREF=WhosWho.html>ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF:</A>
</H3><P>Our administrative staff coordinates between Egg Donor, Intended
Parents, doctors, psychologists, laboratories, hospitals and attorneys. (Doctors,
psychologists, attorneys are independent professionals.) Our skilled staff
ensure that all necessary steps are taken and full documentation is in place
prior to commencement of medication and synchronization of cycles. Additionally,
statistics are updated regularly regarding our egg donation program. We encourage
all our clients to stay in close contact with our offices during this process.
<H3>INFERTILITY SPECIALISTS:
</H3><P>The Center works in conjunction with recognized infertility specialists
who utilize advanced reproductive technologies. These specialists are independent
of the Center. All participants undergo an in depth medical screening and
evaluation in our Egg Donor Program. Typically, the specialist involved is
the doctor that the recipient couple has past experience working with.
Alternatively, the Center and the psychologists can assist couples in selecting
a specialist.
<H3><A HREF="WhosWho.html#Hilary">PSYCHOLOGISTS:</A>
</H3><P>Consulting psychologists, <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Elaine">Dr. Elaine
Gordon</A> and <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Hilary">Dr. Hilary Hanafin</A>, are
specifically trained and individually recognized nationally for their work
in the field of third party reproduction. Our egg donors are required to
undergo an in-depth psychological evaluation and screening process. Ongoing
supportive contact for both donor and recipient is available.
<H3><A HREF="WhosWho.html#Atty">LEGAL COUNSEL:</A>
</H3><P>The egg donor and the recipient couple must each meet with outside
independent legal counsel to discuss the <A HREF=EDLeg.html>contractual
agreement</A> into which they both enter. This contract should define all
parties' rights and responsibilities, as well as the legal status and disposition
of the embryos.
<P>Contracts are drafted by the recipient independent couple's attorney,
<A HREF=Attybio.html>John Ciccarelli.</A>
