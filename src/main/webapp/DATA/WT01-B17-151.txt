<a name="live"><h4>GREATER HEALTH AND LONGEVITY</a></h4>
Chlorella, the Green Algae Superfood, May Be the Answer<p>
In Japan, chlorella pyrenoidosa, a freshwater single-celled green algae, is more popular as a regular supplement than vitamin C. An estimated 5 million Japanese use this medicinal algae every day. Chlorella’s broad spectrum health benefits, amply researched by Japanese scientists, include the impressive fact that it contains 60% protein, including all the essential amino acids, and high levels of beta carotene and chlorophyll. <p>
It is to chlorella’s high chlorophyll content (more chlorophyll per gram than any other plant) that many researchers (and enthusiastic users) attribute its multiple health benefits, but new research from Japan suggests that chlorella’s secret might lie elsewhere—in its effect on albumin.<p>
Albumin, continually secreted by the liver, is the most abundant protein found in the blood. It acts as a major natural antioxidant, contributing an estimated 80% of all neutralizing activity against free radicals in the blood that would otherwise damage cells and tissues. <p>
Albumin transports key nutritional substances and detoxifies the fluid surrounding cells in the connective tissue. But most important, at least 38 recent scientific studies have demonstrated the strong relationship between high blood levels of albumin and the lifespan of cells. This research, says Tim Sara, president of Nature’s Balance, a major U.S. supplier of chlorella, “has confirmed that serum levels of albumin are extremely accurate indicators of overall health status and that low albumin levels exist at the onset and progression of virtually every nonhereditary, degenerative disease process, including cancers and cardiovascular heart disease.”<p>
The chlorella connection is simple, says Sara, who discerned it amidst Japanese research data. A series of studies with rats demonstrated that chlorella supplementation increases albumin levels by 16-21%. Another study showed that among 50 people with Alzheimer’s, aged 70-90, taking 6 g daily of chlorella for 6 months, 68% experienced either a stabilization or improvement in cognitive functions. <p>
Both scientific documentation and reliable anecdotal reports indicate that chlorella is effective in helping to reduce the symptoms of numerous types of cancers, diabetes, low blood sugar, arthritis, AIDS, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, peptic ulcers, viral and bacterial infections, anemia, and multiple sclerosis. <p>
Chlorella is considered a first-string detoxifying agent, capable of removing alcohol from the liver and heavy metals (such as cadmium and mercury), certain pesticides, herbicides, and polychlorbiphenyls (P.C.B.s) from the body’s tissues. A Japanese study showed that taking 4-6 grams of chlorella before consuming alcohol can prevent hangovers 96% of the time, even after a night of heavy drinking. <p>
Chlorella can also absorb toxins from the intestines, help relieve chronic constipation, favorably alter the bacteria flora content of the bowel, and eliminate intestinal gas. It’s also effective in healing skin wounds, both mild and severe. <p>

<a name="gett"><h4>READING THE HEALTH MESSAGE IN THE BLOOD</a></h4>
Making the Blood Test a Guide to Therapy<p>
Whether you’re a conventional physician, a naturopath, or a chiropractor—or their patient—knowing as much as possible about the biochemical status of a person is an invaluable guide to developing the most effective, individually tailored supplement program. With this in mind, in 1985, Mark A. Schauss developed a new method for making optimum, practical use of information revealed by the standard blood test. <p>
Now, through his Carbon Based Corporation, the Blood Test inexpensively offers both doctors and patients a 5-part user-friendly formulation of the information, opening “a therapeutic window” to one’s unique biochemistry, says Schauss. It also empowers users to take more control of their health care by being able to make more informed decisions.<p>
The Basic Status Report alphabetically lists the amounts detected of about 44 substances normally found in the blood. But it also ranks these items, such as cholesterol, lymphocytes, sodium, and bilirubin, according to their relative deviation from the mean. Schauss calls this ranking “% Status,” which demonstrates by what percentage the client’s readings are higher or lower than a statistical norm. <p>
For example, normal sodium levels range from 135 to 145, so a one-point deviation is substantial as there are only 10 points for normalcy, Schauss explains. On the other hand, normal triglycerides range from 0-250 so a one-point change here is not significant. The idea is to provide a statistical context and normative comparison for the test results as measured against agreed-upon standards of what’s normal, Schauss says.<p>
The Blood Test also offers a Panel Report that groups the results according to 14 biochemical considerations, such as electrolytes, kidney function, acid or alkaline pH, nitrogen, and protein. “You can review each of the panels at a glance for unbalanced patterns in your patient’s blood chemistry,” says Schauss. <p>
A particularly innovative feature is the Disease Indicators Report, in which the total blood status is compared with the known indicators of any of 140 diseases. Here, known disease patterns, as revealed in a blood analysis, are correlated with the individual’s results. For example, the test might indicate a 62.5% match for myasthenia gravis, a 40% match for folic acid deficiency, and a 33.33% match for angina pectoris. This is preventive information of high value.<p>
The Drug Interactions Report identifies potential aggravating effects if the patient were to use any of hundreds of conventional drugs. For example, if one’s total bilirubin is out of balance, the use of aspirin, pencillin, niacin, or streptomycin is contraindicated because these would further the imbalance. <p>
Finally, the Biochemical Pharmacology Report suggests which supplements are indicated for the given abnormal blood chemistry; the exact dosages are left to a physician to determine.<p>
Carbon Based Corporation delivers the 5-part report to clients within 48 hours for a cost of about $100, including blood test fees.<p>

<a name="unkn"><h4>UNKNOWN REMEDY FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</a></h4>
Intravenous Calcium  Effective Against<p>
Autoimmune Diseases<p>
Although German physician Hans Nieper, M.D., devoted 35 years of professional study to calcium AEP (a calcium salt of 2-amino ethanol phosphate, naturally found in the human body, especially the brain) and reported on his successful clinical use of this substance back in 1968, the medical world has ignored it ever since. Dr. Nieper used calcium AEP to treat 4000 patients and Robert C. Atkins, M.D., medical director of The Atkins Center in New York City, has used it with great results on 600 patients, most of whom had multiple sclerosis (MS). <p>
CaAEP is given intravenously 3-5 times weekly in a dosage of 400 mg in 10 cc of liquid carrier; up to 6 pills of CaAEP are taken orally at the same time, says Dr. Atkins. In 1986, when 151 of Dr. Nieper’s  American MS patients were polled, 63% reported neurological improvements from using this natural chemical. “My 600 or so MS patients confirm the results,” adds Dr. Atkins. They reported less fatigue and numbness, reduced spasms, better bladder function, and improvements in coordination, walking, balance, and general muscular strength. Calcium AEP is most successful when used in the early stages of MS.<p>
CaAEP has produced clinical improvements in numerous autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn’s, colitis, nephritis, and Type I diabetes, says Dr. Atkins. Early indications suggest it might be effective in preventing breast cancer. Its unique quality appears to be an ability to improve illnesses against which conventional medicine has had no success other than using risky or toxic drugs that suppress the immune system.<p>
The only disadvantage is that injectable calcium AEP is difficult to obtain, thanks almost entirely to unwarranted  interference by the FDA. However, the skillful application of “compassionate use” personal import provisions in cooperation with a physician can be a successful way to get it from Germany, says Dr. Atkins.<p>
