<P>
As revealed by the last ZEPHYR competition <A HREF="#References" >(1)  
</A>, natural ventilation is the first design strategy used by
architects or designers to reduce building cooling loads and improve
indoor comfort in Mediterranean countries where air conditioning
systems do not represent a systematical and realistic alternative.
Unfortunately, if the effects of natural ventilation on the energy
balance of a room or on the perceived comfort of the occupant
have been extensively described and can be experienced by anyone,
the prediction and design of natural ventilation and its integration
in building design as a passive cooling strategy is not really
well dominated. In order to fill these existing gaps, natural
ventilation phenomena have been extensively studied in the framework
of the PASCOOL research project <A HREF="#References" >(2) </A>.
The coordinated efforts of research groups from Belgium (BBRI),
France (University of La Rochelle and ENTPE), Greece (University
of Athens), Italy ( University of Milano), Portugal (University
of Porto), Spain (University of Malaga) and Switzerland (EPFL)
have made this PASCOOL task one of the most significant contributions
to natural ventilation studies in the recent years.
<H2><A NAME="Aims">Aims </A>and Strategies of the Ventilation
PASCOOL Task</H2>

<P>
Based on a huge experimental programme, various different aspects
of the problem were covered during the PASCOOL project:
<UL>
<LI>single sided ventilation
<LI>cross ventilation/
<LI>airflow through large openings
<LI>night ventilation and the coupling with thermal mass.
</UL>

<P>
More than a hundred single sided and cross ventilation experiments
were performed in various buildings and test cells located in
different countries in Europe. In order to evaluate the ventilation
flow rates, experimental techniques using tracer gases have been
experienced and tested in natural ventilation configuration as
well as energy balance approaches. Various geometrical and climatic
configurations have been tested. Combined ventilation and thermal
mass experiments have also been performed to study air flow patterns
in multizone buildings presenting important stack effects.&lt;R&gt;
<P>
Various models have also been tested in order to predict natural
ventilation air flows in buildings. New models resulting from
the experiments have been proposed and integrated in a new air
flow model PASSPORT-Air based on a network approach. In order
to feed this code with realistic data, the group has developed
CPCALC+ <A HREF="#References" >(3) </A> a new method predicting
the pressure coefficients on building surfaces for various shapes
of building and roofs. Wind tunnel experiments using three boundary
layer profiles have been used to obtain regression curves for
the determination of the pressure coefficient distribution.
<P>
Finally a new approach using zonal modelling has been proposed
in order to assess air flow patterns in naturally ventilated rooms.
<H2><A NAME="Final">Final </A>Products and Main Results of the
PASCOOL Natural Ventilation Task</H2>

<P>
All the results of the Ventilation task are presented in the &#171;Ventilation-Thermal
Mass Subtask Final Report&#187; <A HREF="#References" >(2) </A>organised
into six chapters describing the contributions of the PASCOOL
Group to the various aspects of natural ventilation. In this short
presentation, we will focus on three main contributions, Single
Sided Ventilation, Cross Ventilation and Air Flow Modelling.
<H2><A NAME="Single">Single </A>Sided Ventilation</H2>

<P>
Single sided ventilation experiments were carried out in real
buildings located in Athens, Madrid and Lyon, and in fully equipped
test cells . Two of them in Athens and BBRI were developed within
the frame of the PASSYS Project. A third one located in Porto
has also been used. Most of the experiments were performed using
tracer gas decay techniques.
<P>
A total of 76 experiments were performed in Greece composing the
largest data base on single sided ventilation. From this data
base, a model has been proposed introducing a correction factor,
CF by which the theoretical flow equations of the network model
have to be multiplied to give more realistic results. Furthermore,
a correlation giving CF in terms of thermal and flow characteristics
has been proposed.
<P>
CF = 0.08 (Gr / (Re^2) )^-0.38 (1)
<P>
With Gr: Grashof number calculated on the height of the opening
and the reference temperature difference, and Re, Reynolds number
calculated using the reference velocity and the depth of the cavity.
<P>
This model has been validated using the results of other single
sided ventilation and it is convenient when the inertial flow
due to wind speed is the driving phenomenon. In the case of higher
temperature differences between outdoor and indoor conditions,
experiments carried out by BBRI in Belgium have demonstrated that
a multi term model is more efficient. This model takes into account
each physical contribution to the air flow by means of a new formulation.
<P>
Q = (Q_net(Cd, Delta_T)^2 + (aAV)^2 + (bA)^2)^0.5 (2)
<P>
With Q_net air flow rate calculated by the network model using
Cd = 0.66, A opening area (m^2), V Wind speed (m/s), a, b wind
and turbulence parameters related to investigated environment.
<P>
It has also been shown in the BBRI experiments that the heterogeneity
of the concentration field is an important source of uncertainty
when evaluating air flow rates due to natural ventilation. A thermal
balance of the room is certainly, when possible, a more accurate
way.
<P>
Indeed, as said before, these models are certainly limited to
a reduced number of conditions (wind direction, wind speed and
temperature differences), and further investigation is now needed
to extend their applicability domain.
<H2><A NAME="Cross">Cross </A>Ventilation</H2>

<P>
From a literature review, various models have been investigated
<H3>Global air flow rate prediction</H3>

<P>
Aynsley's Model (1977) <A HREF="#References" >(4) </A><BR>
Vickery's Model (1987) <A HREF="#References" >(5) </A><BR>
Global resistance approach (Aynsley 1988) <A HREF="#References" >(6)  
</A><BR>
Virtual Stream tube method (Murakami 1991) <A HREF="#References" >(7)  
</A>
<H3>Velocity Coefficient Approaches</H3>

<P>
Gouin (1984) <A HREF="#References" >(8) </A><BR>
Givonni (1988) <A HREF="#References" >(9) </A><BR>
Ernest (1991) <A HREF="#References" >(10) </A>
<P>
This review shows that there is a wide range of uncertainty in
these various models. In most cases the applicability limits are
not well described, and they can be very difficult to extend to
general cases.
<P>
In order to study a wide range of configurations, different experimental
facilities have been used in Belgium, Greece, Spain and Switzerland.
The resulting experiments were carried out using either constant
injection or decay methods.
<P>
Single zone and two zone experiments carried out in Athens used
the Aynsley model to identify the discharge coefficient of the
openings. A low value of .2 has been identified and does not seem
to be influenced by the thermal conditions. In these experiments,
the mixing of the tracer gas was found to be very good. This result
is surprising and disagrees with Murakami's description of an
inertial flow crossing the room.
<P>
On the contrary, the experiments carried out in Mendillory building
in Spain showed a real difficulty in assessing a good homogeneity
of the tracer gas in cross ventilation configuration. In this
case, the decay method appears to be more appropriate than the
constant injection.
<P>
Givonni's model giving the mean velocity within the cell has also
been used in order to propose various correlations. Nevertheless,
the whole experience of cross ventilation studies carried out
during the PASCOOL Project clearly shows that specific experimental
facilities are now necessary to go a step further. The boundary
conditions have to be controlled very carefully in order to give
a strict indication of the limits of applicability of the various
existing models.
<H2><A NAME="Air">Air </A>Flow Predictions</H2>

<P>
During the PASCOOL Project, the modelling activities were split
into two main contributions. On the one hand, a multizone air
flow model PASSPORT-Air adapted to natural ventilation conditions
has been developed and evaluated through the large experimental
PASCOOL data base. On the other hand, a new approach using zonal
modelling has been investigated. PASSPORT-Air is based on a nodal
concept, each zone of a building is represented by a pressure
node. Boundary nodes are also representing the outside environment,
and flow equations are used to calculate the air flows through
each flow path. Cracks, windows, doors and shafts are considered,
and special care has been devoted to the prediction of natural
ventilation flows.<BR>

<P>
This model has been evaluated by comparison with five other airflow
models, namely ESP, COMIS, BREEZE, AIRNET, and NORMA. Almost similar
airflow rates are predicted by all tools when assuming regular
air flow equations as shown in <A HREF="#Table_1" >Table 1 </A>.
Nevertheless the introduction of the Correction Factor significantly
improves the accuracy of the prediction. The correlation coefficient
between experimental values and numerical prediction goes from
0.4 without CF to 0.75 with CF correction. <A HREF="#Figure_1" >Figure 1  
</A>presents this result. Further validation of the model is obviously
necessary to confirm this result, and special care in cross ventilation
prediction will be required.<BR>

</I>
<P>
The limits of airflow network models are well known. While they
can predict the air flow rates between the zones of a building
and the outdoors, they are not able to give any information about
airflow patterns and velocity field within the rooms although
these data are obviously necessary when dealing with comfort prediction
or natural ventilation efficiency. CFD codes could be used for
this purpose, however they are very heavy to use and the results
are sometimes questionnable when using a limited number of nodes
or wall functions. An intermediate concept has been developed
over few years introducing an empirical description of a cavity
in dominant flows: boundary layers, jets or plumes. These flows
can be described by analytical functions or empirical correlations
and mass balance and energy balance in each zone of the room are
then sufficient to predict air flow patterns and heat flows <A HREF="#References" >(12)  
</A>. During the PASCOOL Project this concept has been used in
order to predict natural ventilation flow patterns within a room.
The results obtained in comparison with those of CFD prediction
are encouraging and further research in this field is very promising.
<H2><A NAME="Conclusion">Conclusion</A></H2>

<P>
A large research effort in the field of natural ventilation has
been carried out during the PASCOOL E.C. Project. Various aspects
of the problem such as single sided ventilation, cross ventilation,
airflow prediction, night ventilation or large internal openings
have been studied, and an important confrontation of experimental
knowledge and theroretical analysis has led to a real improvement
of experience in this domain. Nevertheless, necessary studies
have also been identified in order to improve the description
of outdoor conditions around buildings and of heterogeneous indoor
environment. Furthermore, another important effort is also necessary
to transform the scientific knowledge acquired during such a project
into efficient design tools and guidelines for architects and
engineers.
