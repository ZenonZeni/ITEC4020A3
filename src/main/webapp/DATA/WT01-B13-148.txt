<I>Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>


While low interest rates helped to ignite the mutual fund boom of the early 1990's, several other factors are now helping to sustain it.

<P>

First, the industry has been steadily expanding its range of products.  There are now 2211 equity funds compared to 1127 in 1990 and 471 in 1984.  In the equity sector, there are now 352 aggressive growth funds, 699 general growth funds, 481 growth and income funds, 33 precious metal funds, 112 equity income funds, 367 international equity funds (excludes U.S.) and 167 global equity funds (includes U.S.).  In the fixed income sector, there are now 2,544 bond funds compared to 1,235 in 1990 and 349 in 1994.  There are 332 government bond funds, 99 high yield corporate bond funds, 306 long-term municipal bond funds, and hundreds of other bond funds offering different combinations of yield and risk.   In the money market sector, there are 672 taxable money market funds, 158 national tax exempt money market funds, and 167 state tax exempt money market funds.   Despite the proliferation of new funds, though, assets in the industry are becoming more concentrated.  The top five fund management groups now account for 36% of industry assets compared to 29% in 1984.  These organizations are spending heavily on marketing and thus increasing consumer awareness of new mutual fund products.

<P>

Secondly, the expansion of the mutual fund industry has coincided with a dramatic expansion of U.S. stock market capitalization.  In January, the market capitalization of America's 7,551 listed companies was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion in January, 1994 (6,925 companies) and $3,957 trillion in January, 1992 (5,608 companies).  The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968.  The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post-war era it was 30.0% in 1974 and 1982.  The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%.  Rising equity prices have had a self-reinforcing impact on mutual fund demand by encouraging greater risk-taking in the household sector.

<P>

Some stock market pundits regard the sharp rise in the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP as a sign of speculative overheating but evidence of serious excesses is inconclusive.  The market's price/earnings ratio is only about 16-17 compared to 26 in 1991 and levels in the 15-19 range during the late 1960's, when interest rates were previously at current levels.    Aside from the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP, the two  measures of equity valuation which appear to be at extreme levels are dividend yields and Tobin's Q (the ratio of stock market value to asset replacement costs).    The U.S. equity market now offers a dividend yield of only 2.6% compared to a previous trough of 2.7% in 1972 and an average of 4.0% during the 1980's.  The ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs has risen to 1.47 from a previous peak of 1.08 in 1965 and an average of .56 during the 1980's.  But there are four explanations for the stock market's valuation  level which suggest that the U.S. equity market may not be over-extended.    First, inflation expectations have been falling steadily during recent years and economic forecasters are now projecting that it will remain subdued through  at least  1997.    Secondly, despite  low  inflation, the return on U.S. corporate capital has risen above 10% during the past two years for the first time since the late 1960's.  The gains in profitability have resulted from expanded productivity and thus also contributed to the low inflation evironment in the economy.  Thirdly, it is difficult for traditional measures of book value and asset replacement cost to capture the earnings potential which companies have as a result of new developments in technology and investment in human capital.  As U.S. firms dominate many high technology sectors and technology has been an important market theme since 1994, book value has been a less dominant criteria for investment decision making.  Finally, the end of the cold war has created a global market economy with 6 billion people compared to the 1.5 billion living in market oriented economies before 1989.  In fact, if we add the foreign sales of U.S. multinational firms to GDP in order to compute a ratio of stock market capitalization to American controlled output, the ratio of stock market capitalization to output drops from 87.5% to 75%.  American firms now have $1.5 trillion of foreign sales excluding exports and this number should expand rapidly as they diversify into new high growth developing countries.

<P>

Thirdly, the mutual fund industry is benefiting from the high growth of retirement oriented savings products, such as Individual Retirement Accounts, 401-K plans, and various forms of defined contribution pension plans.  In 1994, such retirement savings accounted for $716 billion of the industry's $2.1 trillion of assets.  IRA programs had $362 billion of assets while defined contribution pension plans had $236 billion of assets.  As a growing number of companies are shifting from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans, the retirement savings held in mutual funds should expand at a steady rate in the future.  In the late 1970's, Peter Drucker had produced a book contending that the U.S. was evolving towards a pension fund form of socialism, in which retirement plans would own most of the U.S. industry and alter worker attitudes towards business.  But this argument was misfocused because the defined benefit plans which prevailed in that period offered the workers guaranteed returns, not the right to choose between a variety of funds with potentially divergent returns.  Today, retirement plans are continuing to expand their ownership of the stock market but they are not producing a passive form of pension fund socialism.  The U.S. is instead embarking upon an unprecedented experiment in the democratization of bond and equity ownership through a mixture of mutual funds, defined contribution pension plans, and direct ownership of securities.  The New York Stock Exchange recently published a study estimating that 51.3 million Americans now own shares directly or through retirement savings programs compared to 42.9 million in 1989, 20 million in 1965 and 6 million during the early 1950's.
