<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The Role of Employee Benefits in
Today's
Economy</STRONG></FONT><P>

	The competition for top quality employees can be
expected
to
stiffen.  Those
same people on your payroll who were grateful to have a job
at all last year could
start
receiving
attractive offers from competitors.  At the same time, if
you're ready to make that
long-delayed
expansion, don't expect new personnel to come cheap.  Base
pay will be a factor. 
But many
employees
are looking for more than cash these days.
<P>
	Your company's benefits will play a bigger role in
attracting and retaining the
right
people to help
your
business grow and prosper.  This means now is a good time -
in fact, a crucial time
- to
rethink your
company's benefits strategy.
<P>
	Keep in mind that a competitive benefits package doesn't
have to cost your
company
an arm and a
leg.  In fact, it is possible to select and then customize
benefits for maximum
advantage to
you and your
company while making sure that  your employees are happy,
too.  The key is to
pick and
choose your
benefits carefully.
<P>

<STRONG>The Benefits of Benefits</STRONG><BR>
	Begin by rethinking your current attitude toward
employee benefits.  To many
small
business
owners,
fringe benefits are perceived as a no-value expense that
eats up the
bottom
line and
provides little in return.  In reality, your company's
employee benefits should
accomplish
three valuable
objectives.
<P>

<OL>
<LI>They should enhance profitability, not cut into it.  The
benefits you provide
should
not be
thought of as
just another expense.  Though indirectly so, they may also lead
to enhanced
profitability -
through reduced
turnover and training expenses, etc.

<LI>They should represent a genuine value to your employees. 
The key is
perception. 
Within your
company, it is important to identify high-profile benefits
that employees will
notice and
appreciate.  This
can often be accomplished by  providing specific benefits to
valued
employees.  

<LI>Ideally, they should also directly benefit you and other
owners.  If you're an
owner-employee, you
may qualify to participate in your company's qualified
benefit plans.  The result
could be tax
and other
savings.  
</OL>

<P>
	In short, you must weigh cost and value when it comes
to
providing the
best-choice benefits within your company.  Let's take a look
at some of those
options and
what they
have to offer you and your employees.
<P>

<STRONG>Standard Benefits Options</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Health Insurance:</STRONG>  With medical costs
continuing to rise, health
insurance is
the most valued and sought-after benefit today.  The problem
is that health
insurance can be
expensive, but only if you provide comprehensive coverage
and pick up the whole
tab.  
<P>
	There are a number of cost-cutting options available. 
For instance, your plan
can be set
up on a
contributory, cost sharing basis, whereby you and your
employees split the cost of
coverage. 
There are
also such premium-saving options as higher deductibles and
benefit limits.
<P>
<STRONG>Life Insurance:</STRONG>  Here, too, options abound. 
Group term coverage,
for
example,
can be surprisingly inexpensive to provide to your
employees.  Many plans tie
benefits to
income.  And
as with health coverage, when properly arranged, your costs
will generally be
deductible as
a business
expense.
<P>
<STRONG>Disability Insurance:</STRONG>  The importance of
such coverage is often
overlooked,
even though the danger of disability is real.  For instance,
according to
statistics compiled for
use by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners, one in
three people between the
ages of
thirty-five
and sixty-five will suffer a disability that lasts six
months or longer. 
Disability coverage
insures an
employee's income earning ability.  It is designed to
replace income if a person
becomes
disabled and
is unable to work.
<P>
<STRONG>Deferred Compensation:</STRONG>  This executive perk
comes in a number of
variations. 
However, under a basic deferred compensation plan, the
employee agrees to either a
reduction in
current salary or a deferral of a planned raise.  In return,
the business commits
to a series of
payments
to the employee at retirement, with the amount, frequency
and duration of payments
determined when
the agreement is negotiated.
<P>  
	Such a plan can help reduce taxes for highly compensated
employees and
supplement their
retirement income.  For the business, it locks in a valued
employee with "golden
handcuffs,"
since the
employee can have no claim to the deferred amounts until
retirement.  This also
protects the
employee,
who generally pays no tax on the funds until they are
actually received. 
<P>
<STRONG>	Qualified Retirement Plans: </STRONG> Especially
if your work force is
older, a qualified
retirement plan may be an attractive benefit.  Options
include defined benefit
plans, defined
contribution
plans, 401(k) plans, Simplified Employee Pensions and more.
<P>
<STRONG>Where to Begin</STRONG><BR>
	That's an overview of some of the most popular choices
when designing the right
benefit package
for
your business.
<P>
	Start the decision process by weighing your objectives
and needs.  Analyze the
pros
and cons of
the
various options available to you.  Keep in mind that your
decision must factor in
tax and
other considerations.
<P>
	Fortunately, you don't have to go it alone.  Your New
York Life representative
can work
with you to
review your situation, analyze your needs and help you
design a benefits package
for your
company
that
reflects your unique situation and, most of all, can help
meet your needs and
objectives.<P>
