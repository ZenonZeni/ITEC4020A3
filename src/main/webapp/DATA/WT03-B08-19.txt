MANDATORY ARBITRATION: TEMPTING LEGAL FATES?

Ever since the Supreme Court ruled that
mandatory arbitration of all employment
disputes is legal in the securities industry,
many other companies have required applicants
to accept similar provisions as a condition for
being hired. This may be tempting the legal
fates.

Congressional staffers, lawyers and researchers
who study employment and human resource issues
say those mandatory agreements may not be legal
outside the security field, and could raise a
host of potential legal liabilities, including
violation of legislative intent, obstruction of
justice or contempt of court charges, and civil
rights violations. The agreements also raise
the specter of new federal legislation
regulating employment.

In addition, mandatory arbitration may not even
reduce the cost of litigation.  An extensive
study shows that--when compared to juries--
arbitrators actually favor employees more, and
award higher settlements.

ARE THEY LEGAL?

In Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., the
Supreme Court upheld pre-employment arbitration
agreements required by the National Association
of Securities Dealers. Left unaddressed is
whether those provisions are legal in any other
industry.

Currently, cases dealing with such agreements
in nonsecurities corporations are working their
way through the courts.

Critics of the corporate rush to lower
litigation costs by having all applicants sign
away their right to sue say those clauses may
be illegal. At least one prominent arbitrator
agrees.

 "You can drawn an analogy to workers'
compensation laws," he says. "Under those
statutes, an employee cannot waive his
litigation rights -- even if he wants to do
so."

The critics also charge that the agreements go
against the intent of Congress when it enacted
anti-discrimination laws and statutes barring
sexual harassment. Courts look to legislative
intent when ruling on legality. The General
Accounting Office --at the request of two
lawmakers--is studying whether pre-employment
arbitration provisions "affect the enforcement
of federal [employment discrimination] laws."

THE INTENT ISSUE

Speaking of the issue of subverting
congressional intent, the arbitrator says,
"There may be something to that." The
agreements "may constitute either willful or
inadvertent subversion of civil rights." That
is because such laws as the Civil Rights Act of
1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
and the American with Disabilities Act all
contain provisions allowing aggrieved workers
to file civil suits against their employers.

"If we didn't want those cases to go to court,
we wouldn't have included those provisions,"
says a key congressional aide who helped draft
some of the statutes.

The GAO study may be an omen of future laws,
says Christine Keen, a principal in the Domani
Group, a Washington research organization. By
relying on the agreements, "corporations could
be tempting federal legislation."

 Keen, who previously handled legislative
issues for the Society for Human Resource
Management, says some state may enact
legislation banning the contracts.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE?

A former senior Justice Department official
tells us that corporations that use pre-
employment arbitration contracts may be--at
best--risking contempt citations, or
obstruction of justice charges in a worst-case
scenario.

MANDATORY ARBITRATION
(CONTINUED)

The official, whose views are in the minority,
explains that Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission guidelines require corporations to
investigate all sexual harassment charges.

 He also says that some civil rights laws
contain an "affirmative obligation" on the part
of employers to report discrimination charges
to investigators.  "By burying those charges in
an arbitration panel," he says, employers could
be obstructing justice.

Another Justice Department alumni disagrees. "I
could see civil contempt proceedings, but
obstruction of justice is creative thinking,"
says the attorney who has prosecuted people for
that charge.

Others note that federal agencies--including
Congress, the EEOC and the National Labor
Relations Board--have said it is good public
policy to arbitrate rather than litigate
disputes. The prominent arbitrator agrees, but
adds that those statutes and rules "aren't
analogous to a corporation saying that--prior
to employment--you have to arbitrate all future
[legal] claims" and give up your right to sue.

HOW ABOUT DIVERSITY?

Yet another issue is diversity -- or rather the
lack of it -- on securities industry panels --
and its effect on discrimination claims.
According to a GAO audit, 89 percent of the 726
arbitrators used were white males over the age
of 60 with little employment law experience.

The industry is "asking these people to deal
with problems they have never encountered and
have no experience with," says an employment
attorney. The lawyer, who currently has a
client before one of those panels, believes
that the arbitrators may not be qualified to
handle complex employment litigation.

Also, this attorney says the lack of diversity
could "raise potential civil rights problems."
She says that employees could argue in court or
before federal agencies that the panels do not
use the EEOC's "reasonable woman" standard when
hearing sexual harassment claims. Those
guidelines require that investigators and/or
corporate officials see the charges from the
female point of view.

DOES ARBITRATION WORK?

Most corporations see arbitration as a way to
reduce the burgeoning cost of employment
litigation. But it may just be a placebo.

"Arbitration is not the Shangri-La that many
think it is," says the Domani Group's Keen. She
cites a GAO report issued earlier this month,
finding that securities industry arbitrators
resolved 34 discrimination claims between 1990
and 1992. Of the 18 cases looked at in depth,
10 resulted in financial awards to employees;
eight were decided in favor of the brokerage
houses.

A study by the California State Automobile
Association had similar findings. While that
study only examined personal injury lawsuits,
it came to the same conclusion: arbitrators may
not save companies money. In 45 cases where the
arbitrator's award was rejected, juries
returned lower damages 73 percent of the time.
That study confirms an earlier nonpublished
examination of a California law mandating pre-
trial arbitration of suits seeking less than
$50,000.

BROADER ISSUES

"The broader issue is whether employers and
employees can buy and sell individual rights.
If you make arbitration a condition of
employment, you're asking someone to sell off
their right to a jury trial," Keen says. "In
that respect, it's no different than the
yellow-dog contracts of the 1930s."

 Before the enactment of the National Labor
Relations Act, corporations required applicants
to agree never to join a union. Those so-called
"yellow-dog" contracts are now illegal. "I
would advise clients [wanting to implement
arbitration agreements] to go slowly," says one
labor lawyer. "After all, if they are found to
be legal, you can always have employees sign
them. If they're not [legal], why risk the
potential litigation?"

The attorney may have a point. In anticipation
of the upcoming GAO study, some members of
Congress are said to be drafting legislation
that would limit the use of mandatory pre-
employment arbitration agreements.

The following are actual cases that have been
heard by national and state courts, the NLRB or
senior arbitration panels.

OSHA PROPOSES SMOKING BAN

As expected, regulations proposed by the
Occupational Safety & Health Administration
would effectively ban smoking at every
workplace in the country. The rule, which
applies to all indoor or enclosed worksites
under OSHA's jurisdictions, is seen as part of
the Clinton administration's continuing anti-
smoking campaign.

President and Mrs. Clinton have banned smoking
inside the White House. Recently the Defense
Department announced a no-smoking policy at all
military bases and offices. The same day OSHA
released its proposal, the head of the Food and
Drug Administration asked Congress for guidance
over whether to regulate nicotine as a drug.
Meanwhile, the House is set to vote on a bill
that would codify OSHA's proposed anti-smoking
regulations into law.

WHAT THE RULES SAY


The OSHA proposals, expected to take effect in
1995 at the earliest, would require employers--
including building owners--to either outrightly
prohibit tobacco usage or to establish
designated smoking areas and only permit
smoking there.

Smoking areas must be "enclosed and exhausted
directly to the outside" and contain all smoke
within the room. Essentially, building owners
or employers would have to install separate
ventilation systems for the smoking areas. That
would make permitting smoking a prohibitively
expense proposition in many workplaces. The
legislation currently making its way through
Congress contains a similar provision.

Employees who do not smoke must not "be
required to enter [the] designated smoking
areas in the performance of [their] normal work
activities." In addition, smoking would be
barred from the rooms while the ventilation
system was being repaired.

In addition to the Tobacco Institute, the
biggest opposition to the proposals is expected
to come from restaurant and bar owners, and
hotel associations. The proposed regulations
would cover eateries and could force them to
ban smoking, according to some OSHA officials.
Restaurant owners maintain that would cost them
smokers' patronage, at a time when the industry
is just beginning to recover from the effects
of the recession.

While the anti-smoking provisions have gotten
the most press, the indoor air quality rule
goes much further. Joseph Dear, OSHA's
administrator, acknowledges that it "is one of
the most extensive ever proposed."

It covers what OSHA calls "building-related
illness" (including sensory irritation,
allergies, infections, humidifier fever,
certain types of pneumonitis, Legionnaires'
disease and chemical exposures). Employers
under the rule would keep written records of
employment complaints, as well as "signs or
symptoms that may be related to building-
related illness."

The regulation--technically an indoor air
quality standard--would require building owners
or corporations to submit written compliance
plans, including a written maintenance program
for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
systems.

In addition, employers would be forced to
conduct inspections, ventilate all fumes that
"could reasonably be expected to result" in
hazardous or particulate exposures to workers,
keep relative humidity below 60%, and maintain
rooms that have windows that open.

WHAT OSHA'S SMOKING RULE REQUIRES

Listed below is the full text of the proposed
OSHA regulation, which would ban smoking in all
workplaces. The regulation, included in the
Indoor Air Quality Standard, covers "offices,
educational facilities, commercial
establishments, healthcare facilities, and
office areas, cafeterias, and break rooms
located [or] used by employees."

In workplaces where the smoking of tobacco
products is not prohibited, the employer shall
establish designated smoking areas and permit
smoking only in such areas.

The employer shall assure that designated
smoking areas are enclosed and exhausted
directly to the outside, and are maintained
under negative pressure (with respect to
surrounding spaces) sufficient to contain
tobacco smoke within the designated area.

The employer shall assure that cleaning and
maintenance work in designated smoking areas is
conducted only when no smoking is taking place.

The employer shall assure that employees are
not required to enter designated smoking areas
in the performance of normal work activities.

The employer shall post signs clearly
indicating areas that are designated smoking
areas, and the employer shall post signs that
will clearly inform anyone entering the
workplace that smoking is restricted to
designated areas.

The employer shall prohibit smoking in
designated smoking areas during any period that
the exhaust ventilation system servicing that
area is not properly operating.

IS IT AGE BIAS TO DISCHARGE A  SECRETARY WHEN
HER BOSS RETIRES?

The following are actual cases that have been
heard by national and state courts, the NLRB or
senior arbitration panels.
THE PROBLEM: Betty Moses had been Joseph
Griesedieck's secretary for 22 years when he
retired as chairman of the board of the
Falstaff Brewing Corporation. Following her
boss's retirement, she was told that she was
being let go.

Moses then sued Falstaff for violating the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. At the trial,
Moses's attorney argued that it was age that
led to Betty Moses's dismissal. She's 48. An
employee with her seniority, experience and
know-how could easily have been absorbed by one
of the company's departments.

Falstaff countered:

  *   We do not practice age discrimination. We
employ men and women of all ages.

  *   However, we have long had a consistent
policy of eliminating the job of secretary when
an officer's functions with the company are
terminated.

THE ANSWER: Case dismissed. Falstaff had a
long-standing policy that secretaries to
officers remained with those persons when the
officers changed positions in the organization.
The secretaries lost their jobs when their
bosses were eliminated or retired, the U.S.
Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, found.  Neither
young nor old secretaries were spared when the
sad day came. Betty Moses's age had nothing to
do with her fate (550 F.2df 1113).

COMMENT: Betty Moses would have had a stronger
case if she had been able to show:

  *   She was replaced by a younger person.

  *   A company officer told her that age was a
factor in her firing.

  *   Statistical evidence showed a pattern of
age discrimination by the employer.

WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS OF  OVERSELLING A JOB?

THE PROBLEM:  The sudden resignation of John
Lund forced Ed Tutwiler Cadillac, Inc. to find
a quick replacement. President E.M.Tutwiler III
sought out Tim Snodgrass, who worked for a
rival company, and guaranteed him a substantial
jump in compensation plus a bonus based on his
department's profit.

The division was a "money maker," Tutwiler
promised, saying that Lund had been employed on
the same basis and had done quite well. Shortly
afterward, Snodgrass quit his job and joined
Tutwiler.

Snodgrass soon regretted the job switch. The
Tutwiler division was a money loser, not a
money maker. Not only did it lose money during
Snodgrass's brief tenure, but it also had been
heavily in the red during John Lund's
incumbency.

Within three months, Snodgrass became
disillusioned and was terminated after several
bitter quarrels with Tutwiler. Snodgrass then
struck back at Tutwiler with a lawsuit for
fraud, alleging he had been lured away from a
safe job with lies about the profitability of
the Tutweiler division and the prospect of
future earnings. Because of the
misrepresentation, he lost income and was
unemployed for a considerable time, Snodgrass
said.

The employer responded that all it was guilty
of was making optimistic predictions about
Snodgrass's future with the company. It's no
crime to build up a job's potential, Tutweiler
asserted.

THE ANSWER: Snodgrass wins his case. Tutwiler's
effusions about the job were more than mere
optimism, the Indiana Court of Appeals found.
Tutwiler deceived Snodgrass about his
predecessor's earnings and the financial
condition of the department. Said the court:

"We agree with Snodgrass that his claim for
fraud is not based upon any predictions or
promises by Tutwiler as to what Snodgrass could
expect to earn as used car manager. Rather it
is based on misrepresentations regarding the
used car department's financial status" (428
N.E.2d 1291).

COMMENT: A company does not commit fraud when
it merely paints a job with glowing colors to a
prospective employee and suggests that a great
future may await him. But a company should be
careful about getting into specifics.

WHEN IS A JOB TERMINATED?

THE PROBLEM: Pat Linz was data processing
manager at the Hoerner Waldorf Corporation when
the firm merged with the Champion International
Corporation. Linz was offered a data processing
managership with Champion, but a study of the
proposed job convinced him that, although his
title would be unchanged, his functions would
be diminished.

At this point, Linz informed Champion that he
regarded his job as "terminated" and he
requested severance pay. When Champion rejected
the request, Linz brought suit for the
severance pay, pointing out that under the
merger agreement, all Hoerner Waldorf employees
were entitled to severance pay if terminated.
His job entailed computer programming, systems
design, analysis, implementation, user service
and data processing. The Champion job would
require less systems design, implementation,
and programming, Linz told the court.

A Champion spokesman rebutted:

  *   The job it offered Linz was substantially
similar to the one he held at Hoerner Waldorf.
The trouble is that he's too finicky.

  *   Linz was not terminated; he quit of his
own accord. He doesn't merit severance pay.

THE ANSWER: No severance pay for Linz; he quit
of his own free will. The Montana Supreme Court
pointed to Webster's definition that
"terminate" means "to put an end to; make to
cease; to end." This had not been the fate of
Linz's position. The court stated:

"Champion offered Linz a comparable position in
his city of residence. His salary was equal to
that he received from his position with Hoerner
Waldorf, with an increase scheduled soon
thereafter. From these facts, we cannot find
that Linz's position was terminated" (675 P.2d
979).

COMMENT: An employee's right to consider a
position to be "terminated" often depends on
how a change in position is effected. Thus, an
employee's contention that his job was
terminated was upheld when he was stripped of
his title of branch manager while his pay and
duties remained unchanged. A Colorado court
found that, without the title, the employee had
lost the respect of co-workers and clients (657
P.2d 457).

CAN A COMPANY MAKE IT A POLICY  TO GIVE EX-
EMPLOYEES A BAD RAP?

THE PROBLEM: As long as employees worked for
William Brown's publishing company, they were
treated as friends and confidants. But any
employee who left Brown's employ soon found
that Brown's benevolence had changed to
implacable hostility.

Thus, the wrath of William Brown descended upon
Patricia Marshall who left his company after
years of service. Marshall was on the verge of
receiving a well-paying job with Jill Boxley
until Boxley telephoned Marshall's ex-boss
about a reference.

"Patricia Marshall was erratic in her work
habits," Brown began. "She brought her personal
problems to the office. Of course, if this the
kind of employee you want..."

Patricia Marshall immediately retaliated with a
lawsuit against the publishing company and its
chief for "wrongful interference with
prospective employment."

At the trial, Marshall had little difficulty
proving that the words attributed to Brown were
unmitigated lies. Brown took the stand and
swore he had never made those comments to Jill
Boxley, but Boxley reaffirmed that Brown had
made the offending remarks.

THE ANSWER: Patricia Marshall wins her case;
and she'll get heavy damages, too. In comparing
the differing versions of the telephone
conversation, the California Court of Appeal
found Jill Boxley's to be more credible. What
made a strong impact on the court was testimony
by George Ryan, a one-time company supervisor
who asserted that Brown "...told me to make it
a policy to give bad references to former
employees. He'd say, 'Shoot them down in
flames'"(190 Cal.Rptr.392).

COMMENT: An employer who intentionally
dispenses untruthful references about an ex-
employee in some instances may even face
criminal charges, depending on state law.

MUST EMPLOYEES BE REIMBURSED FOR A PAY CUT IF
BUSINESS IMPROVES?

The Problem: When a series of reverses put Bob
Adams Motors, Inc., in the red, president Bob
Adams called his personnel to a meeting where
he said: "We can either fire a number of you--
or we can cut everyone's pay 20 percent. Which
will it be?"

The assembled employees agreed to accept a pay
cut. Bob Adams thanked his employees and then
exclaimed: "If business improves by the end of
the year, you'll be reimbursed--if possible."

By the following year, business had improved
sufficiently for the company to restore
salaries to their former level, but then Bob
Adams sold the  business to new owners. At this
point, the staff sued Bob Adams for
"defrauding" them out of the money he had
deducted from their salaries, asserting:

  * Bob Adams made us believe that the pay cut
would be reimbursed to us if business improved.
He reneged on that promise. Business did
improve - but he never gave us back our money.
That was fraud!

Not so, countered Bob Adams. All he promised
was that "if possible" he would repay the
wages.

The Answer: No reimbursement for the employees.
To the Missouri Court of Appeals, Bob Adams's
remarks at the pay cut gathering were "a mere
promise or expression of opinion--neither of
which are enforceable" (550 S.W.2d 850).

COMMENT: It must be borne in mind, however,
that an employer will not escape unscathed from
pay restitution demands where the reductions
violate the minimum-wage law, deny employees
overtime pay due them under the wage-hour law,
or are tainted by violations of the anti-
discrimination laws.

At this point, the staff banded together and
sued Bob Adams for "defrauding" them out of the
money he had deducted from their salaries. In
court, the employees inveighed:

PROBLEM RESOLUTION

The following policies are currently in use in
the companies named. Requests for anonymity
have been respected.
When employees believe they have been treated
unfairly in relation to established corporate
policies, where do they turn? Formal problem
resolution procedures can help protect the
rights of both employees and employers. A not-
for-profit rehabilitation firm uses these
procedures as a guide for administering its
policies fairly.

1.  The employee will file a statement with the
supervisor on a form to be provided by the
Corporation. The Supervisor will meet with the
employee and attempt to resolve the problem or
situation.

2.  In the event the problem or situation
cannot be resolved in Step 1, the employee and
supervisor will submit separate written
statements regarding the problem to the
appropriate administrative staff person. This
individual will meet with both parties and
review any relevant materials. Then a written
statement of resolution will be issued by this
reviewer.

3.  If the employee remains dissatisfied, an
appeal using the same process may be made to
the Executive Director. The Executive Director
will issue a written statement of the
resolution after meeting with the involved
parties and reviewing the written materials.
The Board of Directors will be informed by the
Executive Director of all problems handled
under this procedure regardless of the level at
which they are resolved. The Board of Directors
may choose to undertake further review or
action.

FUNERAL/BEREAVEMENT POLICY

A company without clear guidelines for funeral
or bereavement leave may find itself in a
squeeze--leaving the employee feeling
distraught as well as harassed, while the
company questions its reimbursement obligation
for attendance at the wakes of distance
relatives. Mount St. Mary's Hospital of Niagara
Falls, N.Y., avoids such problems with the
following.

An excused absence from work with straight time
pay to attend the funeral and make burial
arrangements will be allowed for full-time
employees who have completed their probationary
period and have furnished the Hospital with
reasonable proof of relationship with the
deceased relative as follows:

A.  In the event of death of spouse, child
(stepchildren, foster children and adopted
children), parent (stepparent), brother,
sister, mother-in-law or father-in-law, up to
three (3) work days with pay. The employee is
not entitled to the benefits if the employee
was not scheduled to work these days. If the
deceased family member resided over 500 miles

POLITICAL ACTIVITY

Some government agencies or departments have
strict rules about who may or may not run for
political office. The State Education
Department of the University of the State of
New York clearly spells out its stipulations.

Department employees are free to engage in any
political activity which is not precluded by
New York State Law or by Department policy
concerning Department employees who run for
public office. The provisions of the State
Civil Service Law prohibit requiring employees
to contribute to any political fund or perform
any political service, nor can you be promoted,
demoted, or dismissed for compliance or refusal
to do so. No one is permitted to use his or her
influence to force the political activity of
any person or group or to interfere with any
election. Employees with questions concerning
this matter may wish to read Section 107 of the
Civil Service Law available in the Division of
Personnel. Employees who are considering
running for office should check with their
supervisors concerning Department policy.

ADOPTIVE PARENT LEAVE

Since passage of the Family Medical Leave Act,
which mandates employers to offer up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave to care for a family
member, many organizations are adding adoption
leave to their policies. This East Coast
personnel and labor relations office outlines
its guidelines.

Any employee who adopts a child may request
child care leave for up to seven months. This
leave may start any time from the data the
adoptive child is placed with the family to the
effective date of the adoption. An employee is
not required to exhaust all appropriate leave
credits before being granted leave without pay,
but may choose to do so. No sick leave or sick
leave with half pay will be approved.

HIRING OF RELATIVES

Nepotism is a sensitive issue at many
companies. The following is the policy at Parma
Community General Hospital in Ohio.

The employment of relatives in the same work
area of an organization may cause serious
conflicts and problems with favoritism and
employee morale. In addition to claims of
partiality in treatment at work, personal
conflicts from outside the work environment can
be carried into day-to-day working
relationships.

Relatives of persons currently employed by the
Hospital may be hired only if they will not be
working directly for or supervising a relative
or will not occupy a position in the same line
of authority within the organization. This
policy applies to any relative, higher or lower
in the organization, who has the authority to
review employment decisions. Hospital employees
cannot be transferred into such a reporting
relationship.

If the relative relationship is established
after employment, the individuals concerned
will decide who is to be transferred. If that
decision is not made within 30 calendar days,
management will decide, taking into
consideration various factors, including but
not limited to the needs of the Hospital, the
employee's respective skills, qualifications,
length of service, etc.

In other cases where a conflict or the
potential for conflict arises, even if there is
no supervisory relationship involved, the
parties may be separated by reassignment or
terminated from employment.

For the purposes of this policy, relatives are
defined to include spouses, parents, children,
brothers, sisters, brothers- and sisters-in-
law, fathers- and
mothers-in-law, grandparents, aunts, uncles,
first cousins, stepparents, stepbrothers,
stepsisters, and stepchildren. This policy also
applies to individuals who are not legally
related but who reside with another employee.

FLSA APPLIED TO PUBLIC SECTOR

In a major action affecting public-sector
employers, the Supreme Court lets stand,
without comment, a district court ruling that
California violated the Fair Labor Standards
Act when it paid workers with IOUs during a
1992 budget impasse lasting 63 days. During
that time, state employees received "registered
warrants"--effectively chits--in lieu of
paychecks. A group of workers sued the state,
charging that it violated a FLSA provision
requiring employers to pay wages in cash or
"its equivalent."

CANNOT LAY OFF SENIOR WORKER FOR YOUNGER

The California Supreme Court says a school
cannot lay off a qualified senior employee and
retain a junior worker. The case involved
Judith Menagh, who was hired by the Montebello
Unified School District in 1977 as a nurse.
Fifteen years later, in the middle of a budget
crisis, she was slated to be terminated while
the district retained a nurse hired after
Menagh. Citing the state's Education Code, the
court holds that a permanent worker cannot be
dismissed while an employee with less seniority
is retained to do the former worker's job.

WOMAN WITH MUSTACHE WINS JOB BACK

The Ritz-Carlton agrees to rehire a woman the
Tysons Corner, Va., hotel fired because she
violated rules barring facial hair on women.
"We are profoundly sorry that this incident
ever happened," says general manager Larry
Sternberg. "We realize now that we were not as
sensitive in this matter as we should have
been." Following her dismissal, Licia Joy
Galinsky had filed a complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. It still is
unclear what law or rule Galinsky alleged the
hotel violated.

MENTAL DISCRIMINATION  #2 ADA COMPLAINT

Discrimination on the basis of mental
disability is the second most commonly filed
complaint under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, finds a report by the Office of Technology
Assessment. The large number of 1,710
complaints received hints at the importance of
discrimination against people with psychiatric
disabilities, OTA notes.

The mentally disabled have three major problems
working on a regular basis: functioning in
society, difficulty concentrating and coping
with day-to-day stress, according to the
report.

The report also says that some mental health
experts believe there is "a significant
correlation between psychopathology, treatment
status and work." As a result, OTA says access
to effective treatment may be the deciding
factor in whether some mentally disabled people
can work, and employers may need to include
educational, psychosocial and vocational
services in any "reasonable accommodation"
under the ADA. Finally, the report hints that
Congress may have to address some unanswered
questions such as, "Can mentally disabled
employees be required to take medication as a
condition for keeping their jobs?," or "Can
employers monitor medication as part of a
reasonable accommodation?" For a copy of the
report, contact the OTA at (202) 224-8996.

INTENT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO OSHA

A federal appeals court rules that intent
doesn't matter when it comes to willful
violations of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act. The Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals holds that the law "makes irrelevant
the employer's good faith disregard of the
regulations, or the employer's belief that its
alternative program meets the objectives of
OSHA's regulations." (Martin v. Trinity
Industries Inc., CA-11, 92-2559)  In 1983, an
OSHA inspector found excessive noise levels in
the plant. Rather than installing a monitoring
system, the employer required workers to wear
protective gear whenever they were in the
plant. Even though those requirements went
beyond OSHA's regulations, the company was
cited for a willful violation in 1987. The
second OSHA inspector made the citation because
the company knew it had violated the noise
regulations and its hazard abatement program
did not meet OSHA's written
