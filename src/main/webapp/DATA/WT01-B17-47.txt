<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Beware aspirin side effects</CENTER></H3>

Although aspirin is touted for its ability to prevent blood clots, the
Mayo Clinic HealthLetter warns of side effects: Aspirin can irri- tate your
stomach lining, cause pain, nausea, vomiting, or heartburn. Over time, it can
lead to bleeding and ulcers. Taking aspirin on a full stomach or using
specially-coated varieties minimizes the chance for these problems. (Look for
the word &quot;enteric-coated&quot; if you must buy aspirin.)

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Vitamin E improves heart health</CENTER></H3>

Research done at the University of Minnesota showed that volunteers who
took 800 lUs of vitamin E daily for just two weeks had up to three times the
resistance to oxidation of LDL cholesterol. (Oxidized LDL is the form
that damages arteries.) Investigators at the University of Texas report that 800
lUs of vitamin E is as good as a combination of vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene
for the same purpose-that is, for reducing arterial damage. So here we have two
more studies to add to a long list. How many more deaths will the FDA be
responsible for before allowing manufacturers to make claims about vitamin E and
its heart-health protection?

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Exercise to relieve and prevent pain</CENTER></H3>

If your work involves computers, hair styling, sewing, or any activity
using repetitive work with your hands or arms, you are at risk for entrapment
and compression of a nerve in your wrist. Resulting symptoms are numbness,
tingling, and severe pain. The problem is identified as <I>carpal tunnel syndrome</I>.  
Those who have it know how debilitating it can be.

<P>Certain exercises are helpful, including wrist stretching: Place the thumb of
your right hand on the top of your left wrist, thumb pointing toward the elbow,
and curl your fingers around the outer part of your left hand. This will support
your left hand. Move the supported hand, flexing and extending it (up and down)
as you press your thumb into your wrist. Move your thumb slowly across your
wrist, pressing into the tendons of your wrist, as you continue to flex and
extend it. Perform this stretch three times. Repeat as often as needed. 

<P>The
following rubber band exercise is preventive-it helps to increase the strength
of tendons and muscles in your hands and fingers: Place a rubber band around
your fingers. Open and close your fingers ten times, two to three times a day.
Increase the number of times you do this as your fingers become
stronger. Also increase the rubber tension of the band to add resistance.

        noninvasive antiviral compound</CENTER></H3>

Until I spoke to Dr. Roscoe L. Van Zandt of Arlington, Texas, I believed
that there was no successful treatment for genital warts. Van Zandt uses a
nonprescription substance called Carrington Wound Gel to treat this problem! The
compound contains an active ingredient found in aloe vera, is nondestructive and
has no preservatives. One application a night for two months is all it takes, he
says.  Van Zandt claims it can even reverse Class 3 or 4 Pap smears, which may
indicate cervical cancer. 

<P>Warts are virus-caused, and virology has become an
increasingly important field of medicine in the past decade. Many infectious
diseases that were once of unknown cause can now be linked to a specific viral
pathogen and controlled with natural antiviral constituents.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Boron, the &quot;bone booster&quot;</CENTER></H3>

Boron, an essential trace mineral, helps to regulate calcium, magnesium,
and phosphorus metabolism-combating bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis
and arthritis. 

<P>New research shows that boron also helps to compensate for
vitamin D deficiency, enhancing not only the mineral content in bone, but also
cartilage development. Another new finding is that boron helps to relieve
depressed hormone concentrations. No wonder boron gets rave reviews from
menopausal women!

<P>Supplements of two milligrams a day are considered safe and
effective by the USDA.

The therapeutic role of ginkgo biloba extract on the impairment of visual
function of the optic nerve caused by diabetes was tested. Ginkgo biloba extract
entraps oxygenated free radicals and is helpful in preventing this visual side
effect. Recommended: Two capsules daily (60 mgs each, 24% potency from 50: 1
extract). <B>Source:</B> <I>Acta Ophthalmologica,</I> Oct 1993, 71(5):623-8.

        <P>There is a consistent relationship between Type I Diabetes (early onset)
and either cow's milk exposure or diminished breast-feeding. In case controlled
studies, patients with early onset diabetes are more likely to have been
breastfed for less than three months and to have been exposed to cow's milk
before four months.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>FIBROIDS</CENTER></H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Nutrient regimen fights fibrolds</CENTER></H3>

<P>     Are you worried about developing fibroids? Here are some things to avoid:
<UL><LI>A high-sugar diet (because sugar depletes B-complex nutrients, which in
turn impedes your ability to process and inactivate estrogen, a fibroid
promoter).
<LI>Caffeine and alcohol (because they deplete nutrients and disrupt liver
function).</UL>


<P>Nutrient fibroid fighters:
<UL>
        <LI>Choline-1000-15000 mg.
        <LI>Inositol-1000-5000 mg.
        <LI>Methionine-500-750 mg.
        <LI>Beta-carotene-25,000 IU Vitamin C-1000-3000 mg.
        <LI>Bioflavonolds-500-1500 mg.
</UL>
        Look for multivitamins without folic acid, boron, or PABA because these
otherwise helpful nutrients tend to increase estrogen levels.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Nasal spray can interfere with sexual performance</CENTER></H3>

Nasal spray does not affect a man's sex drive-that is, his desire for
sex-but it can affect the ability to get an erection.&quot;Sometimes it makes
the penis wilt,&quot;says Perry Nadig, MD, urologist and clinical professor of
urology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Nasal
sprays contain a substance phenylephrine (also known as neosynephrine).  This is
the same substance used to reverse prolonged erections. &quot;So we know that it
interferes with erection.&quot;Phenylephrine derives from epinephrine, which we
used to call adrenaline, the &quot;fight or flight&quot; chemical secreted by
the adrenal glands when we are anx- ious or afraid.  The spray works by
shrinking blood vessels that are swelling the sinuses, helping you to breathe
more easily. Since the sub- stance also shrinks blood vessels throughout the
body-including those of the penis-it can have an adverse effect on erectile
response. (This effect is only temporary.)
