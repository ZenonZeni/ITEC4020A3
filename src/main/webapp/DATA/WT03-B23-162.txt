<P>
Mutual funds offer a sensible solution to investing
in today's financial markets, but with more than 5,000 mutual
funds from which to choose, identifying the most appropriate funds
for your specific needs can be quite challenging. The <I>FundManager
Funds </I>offer you a prudent, time-saving solution to this dilemma.

<P>
Investors can choose from five separate mutual
funds, each with a different investment objective. Each fund seeks 
to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a diversified 
portfolio of other load and no-load mutual funds
including institutional funds and funds currently closed to the
public. Some of the funds used in the program are from
such companies as American, Fidelity, Templeton, and Vanguard
to name a few. With this unique approach, <I>FundManager Funds</I>
effectively harness the experience and expertise of some of
the nation's most talented portfolio managers. And because of
their substantial purchasing power, the <I>FundManager Funds</I>
program invests in many load funds at no-load, a savings that
is passed along to its investors.

<P>
The <I>FundManager Funds</I> are managed by
the M.D. Hirsch Division of 	<A HREF="specfree.htm">Freedom Capital Management Corporation</A>.
Michael D. Hirsch, chief portfolio manager, pioneered the multi-fund
investment process in the U.S. in 1975. Before selecting a fund
for investment, the investment team directed by Michael Hirsch
researches and analyzes the entire mutual fund universe. They
conduct in-depth personal interviews with portfolio managers of
each fund under consideration to obtain more detailed information
about its investment strategy, style and research capabilities.

<P>
If you would like more complete information
about the <I>FundManager Funds, </I>including charges and expenses,

current prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before
you invest.<BR>
