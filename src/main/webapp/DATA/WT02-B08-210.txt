<h2><a name="archiv">Archives</h2>

The Institute's Archives hold one of the largest collections of manuscript and other unpublished
 material relating to the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and to many persons who have worked there.  
<p>
The catalogue of the Archives was published in 1982 <b>Manuscripts in the Scott Polar Research 
Institute, Cambridge, England</b> by Clive Holland; (London and New York, Garland Publishing, 
ISBN 0 8240 9394 1).  Supplementary indices are available for material received subsequently.
<p>
About half the collection is of Antarctic interest and covers all parts of the continent and islands.  
Of  that which relates to the Arctic the exploration of northern Canada is particularly well represented, 
although all other regions are covered to some extent (notably Greenland and Svalbard).  
<p>
Detailed chronologies of Arctic exploration, largely based on SPRI records, appeared 
<ul>
<li>in 1978 as <b>The exploration of northern Canada</b> by Alan Cooke and Clive Holland; (Toronto, Arctic 
History Press, ISBN 0 7710 2265 4) and 
<li>in 1994 as <b>Arctic exploration and development c.500 B.C. to 1915</b> by Clive Holland; (New 
York and London, Garland Press, ISBN 0 8240 7648 6)
</ul>
In 1989 a <b>Chronological list of Antarctic expeditions and related historical events</b> was published
by Robert Headland; (Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0 521 309034) and an unpublished revision 
of this to 1994 is also available.
<p>
The material held in the Archives has been received from a large variety of sources.  The majority 
has been given and some deposited on loan.  It includes some very recent important additions which 
demonstrate the continued generosity of several benefactors.  Other material is sometimes acquired 
by purchase.  Presently, prices for items with polar interest are high and increasing, thus fund raising 
forms a substantial part of the Institute's work and is a significant problem for the collections.
<p>
A note on requirements for access to manuscript and other archival items at the Institute is available 
from the Archivist who will advise on particular fields of investigation.  It is necessary to make an 
appointment to use the material; some periods may be restricted owing to prior bookings, special 
events, and availability of staff.  Archival material is not made available outside the Institute.
<p>
<h3>Library and map collection</h3>
The Institute also houses the world's largest Arctic and Antarctic <a href="lib/libhome.htm">library</a>.  Readers using the
archives also have access to the published material, including the large collection of maps and 
charts.

<h2><a name="mus">Museum</a></h2>
<b>Curator</b> R.K. Headland<p>

 The Scott Polar Research Institute's Museum holds a collection of artifacts, paintings, drawings, 
photographs (including cinematographic film, lantern slides, and Daguerreotypes), and other material. 
 A proportion of this is exhibited in a private museum on the ground floor which is freely open
 to persons with an interest in polar regions, 
between 14:30 and 16:00 on Monday to Saturday (with the exception of some public and university holidays and a few other days)
.  A note on 
admission and group bookings is available from the Curator.  As well as the permanent exhibits, 
the Museum arranges a Special Exhibition annually and occasionally displays other items of 
particular interest.  Some display cabinets have books, postcards, posters, and other items 
which may be purchased from the Inquiry Office.
<p>
The museum catalogue is not published but is available to visitors by appointment.   However,
Tim Hunt has written a 
<A HREF="http://rfy.nerc-smru.ac.uk/~tim/sprimus.html">
short guide to the Museum</A>
<p>
Acquisition of museum material has been principally by gift.  Access conditions for collections
not on display are similar to those for archival materials.  Copies of items in the Institute's collections, 
including paintings and photographs, can be supplied for publication; a note on these and other 
conditions is available from the Curator.  The museum does not lend artifacts or other materials.
<p>
The University of Cambridge Publications Department included a 
<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/CambUniv/RepMuseums/Scott.html">description</a> of 
the SPRI Museum, in the <B>Reporter</B> on 23 March 1995.
