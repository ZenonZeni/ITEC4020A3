ENEL DIPS BELOW $34.00

Italy's ENEL has made awards to South African producers following its
recent tender and has done so at much lower levels than most predicted.
At what is believed to be $33.65 FOBT Richards Bay, basis 6,200kc GAR,
the price not only covers the tonnages award to the two successful
tenderers - Amcoal and Ingwe - but also the second year of two-year
contracts awarded a year ago to Shell and, again, Ingwe.

In all 2.5mt has been awarded plus 400,000t in options: under the new
tender, Amcoal gets 1mt including options and Ingwe 300,000t including
options while under the terms of last year's two-year contracts, Ingwe
will ship 700,000t and Shell 400,000t. Last year's prices were $32.50
for Ingwe and Shell and $32.60 for other South African suppliers.

Under the terms of the new awards, Amcoal will receive a two-year
contract with 1mt earmarked for 1997 and Ingwe's tonnage under the two
awards will be rolled together for a similar 1mt volume for next year.

Over the next two weeks ENEL will negotiate with the Colombian
producers it approached in its search for 500,000t. These include:
Carbocol, Intercor, Carbones del Caribe and Drummond. The settlement
price is expected to be in a $36-36.50 range basis 11,700/11,800
Btu/lb.

When all the tonnage is booked from these tenders, purchases will
proceed for Chinese, Polish and Venezuelan deliveries.

US exporters told ICR New Year's Week they expect Enel's tender for 1mt
of US coal "any day." It was originally scheduled for mid-December.
Delays are related to a change in spec: Enel plans to cut the sulfur
limit from 1.0% to 0.8% and the Btu minimum from 12,500 to 12,000. Ash
stays at 10%, which for southern Appalachian coals tends to correspond
to the previous higher Btu level, raising the question of Btu premiums.

TAIPOWER SEEKS AUSTRALIAN LOW

Taiwan Power Corporation has started 1996 with a bang with two tenders
out and a decision imminent for Australian coal which looks like
setting a new low benchmark for its long-term contract buy-ins. The two
tenders include a second attempt to purchase a trial panamax of low
c.v. (4,500kc-5,500kc GAR), high moisture material for its Taichung
station, the tender closing on January 16. The second tender is for
five panamaxes for March and April delivery. Contact: Director of Fuel,
Taiwan Power, 9th Floor, 242 Roosevelt Road, Section 3, Taipei 100,
Taiwan. Phone: 886 2 366 6752; fax, 886 2 367 0597.

But it is reports of very low prices in four bids into a tender for a
long-term supplies from Australia which created something of a buzz
this week. The bids are from Camberwell, Saxonvale, Ulan and Coal and
Allied, spanning less than $2 from a low of just under $22.50 FOB. None
of the companies contacted said they had heard from Taipower about the
tender and suggested that prices quoted were lower than their actual
bids. The prices will be for the first year of deliveries in a seven-
year contract.

NATPOWER BUYS FOUR CAPES

National Power of the UK has booked four capes from the US for first
quarter delivery, bringing to well in excess of 1mt the company has
booked for 1996 delivery just from the US. The purchases, of mid-
sulphur material, have all been done a few cents higher than similar
purchases by the company in the Fall of 1995. They have helped to
produce a drying up of supplies of this quality coal from some US
suppliers. One cape is from the East Coast from AMCI - which had
already won 500,000t worth of business from NatPower; the balance is
coming through traders from the Gulf.

TRY SPOT, JAPANESE URGED

Japanese utilities should ditch their dependence on contract purchases
and increase the amount of spot tonnage bought, according to a study*
by the country's Institute of Energy Economics.

The study, comparing Japanese utility buying practices with those in
Europe, South Korea, and Taiwan, urges the utilities to become more
flexible for at least 1.8mt of their annual needs. This tonnage, 6% of
current demand, represents the fluctuations in annual consumption
caused by different weather conditions in recent years.

Tonnage fluctuations are likely to increase as coal stations shift
towards mid-loading and consequently, says the study, spot purchases
should move towards 10% of annual consumption.

In comparison with virtually no spot purchases by Japanese power
companies, European, Taiwanese and Korean powercos take 28-44%, 10-30%
and 10% respectively of their coal needs from the spot market.

The next few years will see Japanese coal stations drop their
utilisation from 65% today to about 59% in 1999 and even lower in
subsequent years, bringing Japanese coal station utilisation close to
those of Europe.

The IEE report sees no merit in current buying practices of including
option tonnages since they bring no benefit in lower prices. Since
Japanese power companies burn high-quality coals of well-known origin,
they are likely to enter the spot market initially through closed
tenders for specific brands. "But, if they hope to procure the cheapest
coal, they have to make open tender-based spot procurement as Taiwan
does," buying coal on physical properties alone, and buying coal which,
in some cases, has an unknown origin, says the IEE study.

EPDC REPLIES TO THE S. AFRICANS

The price ideas requested by Japan's Electric Power Development
Corporation - a request which led to demands for rises of $3 - have now
received a dusty response from the EPDC buyers for a c25 cut to $36.36
FOBT Richard Bay. This price relates to Total's Ermelo supplies basis
6,021kc NAR. The other offers range upwards from $33.80 for TCOA's
Witbank and include Total's Arthur Taylor and Shell's Rietspruit.

TNEB AWARDS CONTRACTS

India's Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has concluded 1996
contracts for a total of 2.4mt, having succeeded in getting the bidders
down to a level of $59.45/t CIF. This is higher than the low bid of
$49.00 submitted by PT Sarita Prima but significantly under all other
bids, which ranged from $64.85 to $73.25/t CIF Madras.

Several of the contract winners appear to be affiliated, based on their
offering the same coals. Glencore and Esteco each offered Cook,
Tselentis, and Prima Comex Indonesia; and Emirates Trading and Western
Shipping each offered Danau Mashitam, Shanxi, and Ensham. PT Sarita
Prima offered Berau and Bukit Asam, while Alagendran Exports offered a
range of Indonesian, South African, and Australian.

The two "unknowns" who won contracts last year along with Alagendran
and Emirates - Ocean Centre and Kerry Coal - have not reappeared on the
line up this time around (ICR 366/1).

KARNATAKA SEEKS 250,000T

Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC) is once again entering the
international market, this time looking for 250,000t. In its previous
attempt to import in 1993, the utility found the offers in response to
its 1mt tender technically and commercially unacceptable (ICR 353/13).

Karnataka is passing through a severe power crisis because of a strike
at Singarani Collieries in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh state since mid-
October. This has created shortages at Karnataka's only coal-fired
power station at Raichur. Hydro activity has also been poor.

Bids can be submitted by January 18 for delivery before May 31.

The bidders are being asked to quote in Indian rupees (the rupee has
declined 12% against the $ since October).

Further information can be obtained from Superintending Engineer (MM),
Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, 82 Shakti Bhavan, 3rd Floor, Race
Course Road, Bungalore - 560001, Karnataka, India. Telephone: +91-(0)80-
2203894 Fax +91-(0)80-2252144.

ANDHRA PRADESH COOLS TO IMPORTS

Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board (APSEB) may not place orders for
the 500,000t quantity it put to tender in September. The utility found
the offers it received at around Rs2,900/t cost three times the price
of domestic coal available from the coal mines in Andhra Pradesh.

The sharp decline in the Rupee value against the dollar in October-
November has further increased the delivery price of imports. Coupled
with the high price factor is the precarious financial position of the
APSEB board.

CHILGENER SETTLES 500,000T

Chilgener has settled a third of its 1.5mt requirement for 1996,
concluding with Colombian producers at competitive prices. Sources say
the buyer claims to have concluded at $34.00-35.00/t FOB basis 6,600kc
GAR.

The company plans to conduct talks with other suppliers over the next
month. It has inventories sufficient to last it until March and can
wait to conclude until late February.

Meanwhile, the Chilean utility has asked for bids on one or two trial
cargoes of western US and western Canadian coals. Offers are due
January 10. Observers say the company is looking to diversify supply
sources, given the rapid growth in its consumption.

CODELCO MAKES AWARDS

Chile's Codelco has awarded contracts for 1996 supplies for the
Tocopilla plant to companies in Canada, Australia, Colombia, and
Indonesia. Prices are believed to be up $4-5 over the previous levels,
but those prices were negotiated in September 1994, before last year's
market upswing. Sources said prices for all suppliers are in the range
of $40-42/t CFR basis 6300kc GAR. The price on the Indonesian coal is
believed to be $36.20/t CFR basis 5,400kc GAR.

Codelco officials told ICR they could not release any details until
contracts are formally concluded. Codelco is acting as purchasing agent
for the new owner of the privatised Tocopilla Division, now called
Central Termica Tocopilla.

Although Codelco had originally asked for bids on 280,000t for 1996 and
900,000t in 1997, it decided not to award any tonnage for the second
year. The volume was set at a higher level for 1997 because several
domestic contracts expire, leaving open the possibility of their
replacement with imports. One observer comments that prices may be
somewhat below market because bidders believed they were competing for
multi-year agreements.

Elsewhere in the Chilean market, P.T. Adaro has won an order for a test
cargo for Chilgener's Guacolda plant.

KIDECO SUPPLIES NEW INDONESIAN POWER PLANT

The South Korean owned coal mine PT Kideco Jaya Agung, in East
Kalimantan, has signed a long-term contract for supply to the
Indonesian private power plant PT Jawa Power. It will be Kideco's first
domestic supply contract. Currently all output is exported, mostly for
use by the South Korean power utility.

PT Jawa Power is in the very early stages of developing 2x600 MW plants
at Paiton in East Java, alongside the existing 2x400MW the existing
2x400 MW units now in operation and run by the state utility PT
Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), and the 2x615 MW units to be built by
the now celebrated private power company, PT Pation Energy Company.

Kideco, wholly Korean owned, (80% of which is by Korean state
agencies), and operating under a production sharing contract with the
Indonesian government, will supply 1.8mt/yr over 30 years to PT Jawa.
This matches the term of PT Jawa's operation, for which a power
purchase agreement with the PLN was signed in April 1995.

It is not yet known where the additional coal needed will come from,
but there are rumours that further supply may be secured from another
Kalimantan producer, PT Berau, which started production in 1994 from
its mines in north-eastern Kalimantan. Berau is a joint venture between
Nissho Iwai of Japan and PT United Tractors Indonesia.

In 1995, Kideco produced about 2.5mt all exported to South Korea.
Kideco said it would increase production to around 6mt by 1999. Kideco
began production from its mine south of Balikapapan in the second half
of 1993. Coal is shipped by road 40k to the Kideco run seaport of Tanah
Merah, which can accommodate bulk carriers of up to 40,000DWT.

PT Jawa is being built by a partnership made up of Siemens of Germany
(50%) PowerGen of Britain (35%) and the Indonesian PT Bumi Pertiwi
Tatapradipta (15%), a subsidiary of the Bimantara group, controlled by
president Suharto's second son, Bambang Trihadmojo.

TMT WINS SAVANNAH ORDER

TMT Coal has won an order to supply 36,000t to Savannah Electric &
Power for the purpose of testing the new unloading dock that is being
constructed to serve the Kraft plant. Delivery will be between March 1
and March 25.

TMT will supply Venezuelan coal produced by Carbosurco in the state of
Falcon. As earlier reported, TMT recently signed a contract to take
230,000t of Carbosurco's output for shipment out of Palmarejo on Lake
Maracaibo (ICR 388/12). Approximately 60% of the volume is earmarked
for one customer and the remainder is being sold on the spot market.

RBCT 1995 EXPORTS HIT 58.1MT

The Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) pulled out all the stops during
December to shift 5.58mt of coal and bring the total throughout for
calendar 1995 to 58.12mt. That compares with the calendar 1994 total
throughput of 53.5mt.

The official throughput target for 1995 issued by the RBCT was 56mt,
although members were told they6 could export coal up to their
respective quotas of a total RBCT throughput of 59mt. Reason for the
lower official target is that major exporters Ingwe and Amcoal - which
between them account for nearly two thirds of RBCT capacity - indicated
early in the year they did not have the coal available to meet
throughput rates equivalent to 59mt. Both groups said that they were
aiming for their shares of a throughput level of 56mt.

A number of the smaller RBCT shareholders made it clear they were not
constrained by such availability problems. It seems some have exported
at more than their proportionate share of 59mt by "buying-in" RBCT
quotas from other members unable to utilise their full entitlements.

Industry sources indicate the going rate for such deals varies between
US$1.5/t and $3/t, depending on market conditions.

It's early days for predictions on 1996 but the feeling in the industry
seems to be that a repeat performance of the 4.6mt growth shown in 1995
is unlikely. Reasons for this are worries over constraints on
production capacity at the various mines, most of which are at full
stretch already, combined with a degree of caution over the market.

The official RBCT line on export growth is that ideally, the members
would like to increase total throughput by about 2-2.5mt annually which
is also about the long-term average annual increase achieved in their
exports. Last year's 4.6mt jump in exports shows many SA exporters are
prepared to go all out to take advantage of favourable market
conditions when they present themselves. A similar performance this
year must, however, bring the RBCT to the limit of the capacity it can
provide through rationalisation and reorganisation of its operations at
minimal capital cost.

The RBCT's nominal capacity is currently stated at 60mt/yr. The
terminal's track record over the past few years has shown the RBCT's
"nominal capacity to be as long as the proverbial piece of string.
While the 60mt/yr number is therefore not a cap it is, however, very
close to what can be achieved without having to make a major capital
investment in expanding the terminal.

a decision on that unspecified investment by the members is pending to
push the terminal's capacity to 70mt. Industry executives comment
conventional wisdom is the RBCT should be exporting between 65mt and
70mt by 2000. Judging by 1995's performance it could be sooner than
that.

COLD WEATHER WARMS UK TRADE

Freezing conditions in North West Europe during December meant relief
for the beleagured UK house coal trade. After a run of mild winters,
capped by an appalling 1994/95 in which trade fell by 20-30% to an
annual rate of well below 2mt/yr, sales were very low throughout 1995.
This reflected high carryover stocks from the winter and structural
changes within the industry.

The structural changes followed the privatisation of British Coal in
December 1994. RJB Mining, the lead producer in the newly privatised
world, made its priority in this sector a deliberate targeting of
import markets, offering heavily discounted supplies in northern
Scotland to challenge longstanding Polish contracts. It also pursued
direct sales to merchants, which had traditionally been supplied by
factors. Merchants, confronted with increasing competition between
different suppliers and between suppliers and factors, had another
reason to hold back from purchasing.

By October, which was the warmest in the UK on record, there were signs
of panic within the industry because coal was still not moving and
balance sheets were already in the red. By this time, two of the
leading factors were changing hands with Coal Products, itself newly
privatised, buying Anglo Coal from Anglo United and the management of
British Fuels just about to secure their company from British Coal. The
management of the third biggest factor, PD Fuels which is owned by
Powell Duffryn, gained exclusivity to bid for their company just before
Christmas.

After the bitterly cold weather of December, traders are now talking of
shortages developing for some grades. They point out that many effects
of the cold snap are yet to be felt because it hit in the middle of a
holiday period when fires were on all of the time.

Another cold snap will surely bring another surge in sales. There is
already a shortage of 50mm plus sized material and of singles. As one
trader put it, "if you had some Colombian product at the moment you'd
sell thousands of tonnes of it, the trouble is none of us has". Given a
lead time of c. 35 days to bring in a typical 35-40,000t consignment
for processing and the fact that the coldest months in the UK are
normally January and February, only those with coal already on the way
or at European stockpiles will be able to respond on time to meet
demand.

PHIBRO SELLS TO EDF

Phibro has sold two capes of Colombian to Electricite de France at
close to $37.00/t FOB basis 12,000 Btu/lb. One will be delivered in
each half of 1996. The purchase completes EdF's requirement for the
first half.

The price is $1.00 less than deals done two or three months ago for US
coal of equivalent quality to EdF. The French company bought from
Exporting Commodities Inc. at $38.00 and, in a deal in which coal could
go either to EdF or to CarboPego, from AMCI at $38.00-38.50.

KEPCO FIXES OVER 1MT

South Korean utility Korea Electric Power Co has booked eight, option a
ninth, capes with compatriot owner Samsun to trade from Newcastle. It
agreed a rate of $6.50 for shipments of 120-132,000t and expects them
to be made over a year from February. Samsun is now in the market for
time charter tonnage to work the business on a consecutive voyage
basis.

GERMAN IMPORTS ROSE 3% IN 1995

Coal and coke imports into Germany increased by only around 3% in 1995
to 18mt, according to the German Coal Importers Federation. The border
price for imported steam coal into Germany averaged DM76t ($53.10)/t
hard coal equivalent during the first 10 months of 1995, just over one
quarter of the price of German coal - DM291/thce - before subsidies
took effect.

In 1996, the importers anticipate that, assuming there are no
significant currency swings, imported coal prices will remain stable
and cheap. It seems contradictory therefore that the volume of imports
is expected to fall by around 10% in 1996. The reason is that many
large consumer utilities have generous coal stocks, the hangover in
volumes from their obligation to buy German coal under the now-lapsed
Jahrhundert contract which were larger than their actual needs.

These companies will draw down their stocks in 1996, reducing purchases
of fresh coal by as much as 10%. German and imported coal are expected
to be affected to the same degree.

Ruhrkohle announced at the end of last year that sales would reach an
average 27mt a year over the next three years, resulting in an excess
production capacity of 2-3mt. Saarberg expects to sell only around 7mt
in 1996 instead of the originally anticipated 8.2mt.

The coal importers association warns against what it considers over-
estimates of coal sales for this year and beyond by politicians
responsible for German coal policy. The consultancy Prognos in Basel,
in particular, is criticised as having given too optimistic a picture
of coal's future market position in its recent energy forecast for the
Federal economy ministry. The development of steam coal use for
electricity generation is especially overrated, say the importers.

BAYERNWERK PLANS 0.3MT IMPORTS.

Saarberg, Germany's second largest coal producer, signed a five-year
coal supply contract with major utility Bayernwerk on December 21 1995,
just days before the 15-year Jahrhundert contract expired at the close
of the year. The deal covers 2.3mt, 0.46mt/a year.

Bayernwerk signed up for coal from Ruhrkohle for 1996-2000 back in July
last year. The contract was for nearly 4mt, a little under 0.8mt per
year. The utility has thus made a firm commitment to use around 1.26mt
of German coal a year. Stocks standing at 0.5mt at the end of 1995 will
also be drawn down.

Furthermore, after two years of using only Germany coal, in 1996
Bayernwerk will import 0.3mt.

Delivery of the imports by water is restricted due to the limited
unloading facilities at the power stations, so the utility buys only
part cargos of 15,000t. Rail deliveries from Poland and the Czech
Republic are more or less continuous week-by-week throughout the year.

AL NASR BIDS SHOW RISES

Opening bids into Egypt's Al Nasr Company of Coke and Chemicals tender
for Australian coals show 5-6% increase on last year's prices. BHP
(Blackwater) and South Blackwater - who supplied under the previous
contract - have bid $47.75 and $47.20 FOB respectively, compared with
last year's price of around $46.

Two newcomers bidding for the Al Nasr "standard high vol" are
Glencore's Cook and KCC's Tahmoor - Glencore close to the traditional
suppliers' prices, KCC for substantially more. All bidders are going
for the full 400,000t on offer which in the case of Cook shows a
remarkable turnaround; only a year ago it was producing just 275,000t.

A second blend is being called for by Al Nasr for 100,000t of lower
vol, lower ash material. One explanation for this development is that
the buyer is seeking an alternative to one of its US coals. MIM (Oaky
Creek) and BHP (Saraji blend) are both going for the full 100,000t
offered.

Traditionally, Al Nasr has come back seeking better prices, although
the fact that it is tendering in the middle of the JSM negotiations
would suggest that few are going to oblige with lower offers with so
much at risk. Decision expected in February. The new contracts will run
for four years commencing on April 1 this year.

The CIF Alexandria prices reveal a wide range of freight estimates ($11-
16.40) suggesting that some suppliers are very keen to get the business
without posting damaging FOB numbers. Alexandria takes panamaxes with
the alternative cape port, El Dikela, sometimes being used.

COALARBED, ISCOR EXPAND TONNAGE

CoalArbed has won new multi-year contracts to supply 250,000t/yr out of
Baltimore to South Africa's Iscor. The tonnage is in addition to the
more than 700,000t that CoalArbed supplied in 1995 under long-term
deals.

CoalArbed will supply mid-vol coking coal from two Pennsylvania
producers, Bradford Coal and K & J Coal. Neither company has been
active in direct sales to export customers in recent years, although
Bradford formerly supplied Pakistan Steel through Hansen Coal.

Both companies have operations in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania,
served by Conrail for shipment through the Consol Coal Pier. They are
strip operations in the Kittanning and Freeport seams with typical
volatile content of 26-27%, according to sources.

Representatives of Iscor were in the US in December to visit mines. The
steel company has been increasing its import tonnage because of
declining reserves at the captive Hlobane colliery and because it wants
to improve coke quality when it adds pulverised coal injection this
year (ICR 365/7). At the moment, the company would take higher import
volumes but is reportedly held back by capacity limitations of its
discharge equipment.

CoalArbed has been supplying Iscor with southern Appalachian coals from
producers such as Consol and Pittston for shipment out of Hampton
Roads. The new contracts represent the first deals out of Baltimore.
But although Iscor's import requirement could rise to nearly 2mt/yr
after 2000, it is expected to cut its US take when it goes ahead with
developing an operation in Queensland at Moranbah, where it is
currently undertaking exploration work.

GERMAN COKERS TO IMPORT 1.3MT.

Backdated to the beginning of 1995, a deal was finally signed shortly
before Christmas by German steel companies and Ruhrkohle allowing the
import of an additional 1.3mt of coking coal a year (ICR 385/2).

The steel companies which operate coking plant - Thyssen Stahl, HKM and
Preussag Stahl will together import between 0.7mt and 0.8mt of coking
coal annually. Thyssen will probably have an import entitlement of
around 0.5mt with the other two mills sharing the rest. Ruhrkohle will
import about 0.5mt, rather more than the figure of 0.32mt circulating
in November last year.

The volumes have been fixed only verbally as they depend on the amount
of coke breeze produced in each company's coking plant. This in turn
can be varied under various technical conditions. Also, for a limited
period, Thyssen will give up a part of its share to the other two
mills.

(The link with coke breeze hinges on the fact that the coking coal
equivalent to the breeze is not eligible for subsidy under the rules of
the Huette Contract.)

The steel companies now allowed to import coking coal will, it seems,
derive no significant financial benefit from the deal as Ruhrkohle
already supplies all coking coal at more or less world market prices.
However the mills will have the opportunity to "practise" with world
market coking coal in preparation for the moment when the door is
finally opened to unrestricted coking coal imports.

This could be in 2002 when the Huette contract expires or earlier if
the German government decides to screw back coking coal subsidies
sooner.

Backdating the agreement to beginning 1995 means that imports by
Thyssen, HKM and Ruhrkohle last year will be covered by the deal.
Preussag however will start importing this year for the first time.

AUSTRALIA SHIPS 137MT

A survey of port throughput in Australia shows that the country lifted
exports from 131.2mt to 136.7mt. Port Kembla was the only port to see a
significant fall, dropping 1.5mt to 10.8mt. Four ports moved over 20mt -
 Gladstone, Hay Point, Dalrymple Bay and Newcastle which rose 3.4mt to
48.9mt.

The stock situation tightened during November, largely through
industrial action, cutting exports stocks from 11.5mt to 11.5mt. A
further fall was predicted for December because of production problems
in Queensland caused by high rainfall. All the fall was in coking coal
which dropped 1.2mt.

BSM NAME SAD COORDINATOR

Once again, the Brazilian steel mills have nominated Helio Sad of
Usiminas as the chief negotiator for this year's coking coal contracts.
Talks are expected to start in late February after Carnival.

It should be noted that although the mills do much of their negotiating
as a bloc, the recent moves of CST to modify or cancel existing
contracts were the actions of that company on its own.

CST STUNS SUPPLIERS

Brazil's CST has astonished the industry by sending out a letter to all
of its coal suppliers asking for a price reduction on existing
contracts. In the case of certain suppliers, CST has followed up with a
second communication saying it is cancelling its contracts with those
companies.

The initial letter went out mid-December from CST's new chief raw
materials buyer, Coletano Abreu. It asked for price cuts of $4.00/t on
coals priced more than $40.00 and cuts of $3.00 on coals between $30.00
and $40.00, both to be effective January 15. At the same time, CST sent
letters to iron ore producer CVRD asking for a 10% cut and to shipping
company Doce Nave also asking for 10%.

The company said it was forced to take the measure because of a 25-30%
drop in sales of steel slabs, its only product. CST is believed to be
under pressure from its leading bank which, like many banks in Brazil,
is going through a bad period due to the lack of inflationary gains
under the new currency system.

Suppliers have universally responded to this message by saying it is
not possible. One major supplier told ICR, "We sent back a very polite
letter saying that we appreciate where they're coming from, but when we
run into bad times we bite the bullet and we expect the customer to do
the same."

The informal reaction, however, has been far from polite. The
implications of such a move are obvious, as the modification of formal
contracts in progress would call into question the whole framework of
agreements in the market. CST's action has reportedly been as unpopular
elsewhere in Brazil as it has with the suppliers, as buyers at the
other mills worry their credibility will be undermined. According to
sources outside CST, it is also highly unpopular with members of the
company's raw materials purchasing staff whose experience in the coal
market is far more extensive than that of the newcomer Abreu.

As mentioned above, the initial price cut request was followed by a
message to selected high-vol suppliers indicating their contracts were
actually being cancelled. This message, sent out December 28, stated:
"Due to substantial changes in our coal blending, as a consequence of
drastic administrative measures because of declining slab prices in the
international market, we are cancelling the balance of our contracts."
   It wasn't clear at press time which companies were the lucky
recipients of this second message. Some sources said, however, they
believed CST was attempting to cut back on US high-vol because it had
recently taken increased volumes of high-vol from Canada's Devco.

C&L SURVEY DETAILS COLLAPSE IN NSW PROFITABILITY

Fiscal 1994/95 was a monetary disaster for the New South Wales coal
industry with the aggregate after tax profit falling by A$100m ($74.4m)
from the previous year to just A$98m, according to the annual survey
conducted by Cooper & Lybrand. However, it is expected that the
performance of the industry will show a marked improvement this year,
and in 1996/97 with the expectation of further price rises this year.

There is now a degree of optimism in the industry, given the higher
prices and continuing increases in productivity, the director of the
NSW Minerals Council and CEO of Peabody Resources, Bob Humphris, said.
Although the latest Coopers & Lybrand survey is now just over six
months out of date, (it covers the 1994/95 FY), it does show the
immense damage caused by the savage price cuts forced by the Japanese
buyers for JFY 1994.

Twenty one companies took part in the survey representing about 80% of
NSW production. This grew by 8% to about 67.5mt in the year, of which a
little more than 50% was won from underground operations. Domestic
demand remained static and all of the additional 5.1mt found its way
into export markets which increased to close to 50mt. Operating profit
after tax but before abnormal and extraordinary items averaged only
A$1.45/t less than half the A$3.19/t profit for the previous financial
year.

If extraordinary and abnormal items are included, the meagre profit is
all but wiped out. The aggregate bottom line result for last financial
year for all the companies surveyed was only A$3m which suggests that,
in all probability, a relatively large percentage of the respondents
traded in the red.

The Minerals Council, as always, has been quick to point out that the
governments' take of coal industry revenue was much higher than that
received by the producers. Total government revenue grew from A$12.14/t
in 1993/94 to A$12.43/t. The figure includes services provided, notably
rail freights, as well as income tax. A breakdown of the total payments
to the state and federal governments suggest that NSW is getting its
act together on becoming a more efficient provider of services.
Provision of government services fell from A$396m in 1992/93 to A$336m
in 1993/94 and to A$312m last financial year - a 24% drop in three
years. This was achieved despite the fact that tonnages moved rose by
almost 9% last year. Capital investment in 1994/95, mirroring industry
optimism, rose to A$625m from $485m the year before and it is estimated
that it will rise further to around A$700m this financial year. It is
also likely that capital expenditure will remain strong for the
remainder of this decade as producers gear up for the anticipated
increase in demand. Most of this will be met through brownfields
expansion, Humphris said. The survey also includes a comparison of data
from a constant group of respondents whose production rose from 60.9mt
to 61.8mt in the last couple of years although employment levels fell
by almost 800 from 12,064 to 11,272. The constant group also performed
better financially than all the respondents with the after tax
operating profit before abnormals and extraordinaries being A$106m
compared with A$210 the previous year.

The Minerals Council has also released data compiled by the Joint Coal
Board and the Reserve Bank which shows that employment levels for the
entire industry continue to fall. These dropped 8.6% in 1992/93 to
14,458, a further 5.2% to 13,701 in 1993/94 and a further 0.6% to
13,612 last financial year. At the same time, output per employee is
rising steadily - up 7.7% three years ago to 5,580t a man year followed
by a 6.5% rise in 1993/94 to 5,940t and a further 6% increase last year
to 6,440t.

Consequently, the labour cost per tonne produced dropped 4.5% in
1992/93, 4.2% in 1993/94 and 2.5% last year to A$10.39.

CONSOL, RHEINBRAUN TALK BUYOUT

DuPont is negotiating with Rheinbraun parent RWE to sell its remaining
50% share in leading US producer Consol, according to reliable sources.
The two sides held a series of pre-Christmas meetings in London to work
out the details of the buyout, but are still talking over valuation,
ICR understands.

The crux of the matter, apparently, is that Rheinbraun does not expect
to pay as much for the second half of the company as it did for the
first half. The German company paid an estimated $1.25bn for its
initial share in 1991 (ICR 270/6).

A Consol spokesman said he could not comment on acquisition rumours.
From Germany, RWE chief Dietmar Kuhnt issued a statement confirming
that DuPont wants to sell its stake in Consol and saying that RWE will
look for another partner or partners to replace DuPont.

Expectations have been high this fall that DuPont would soon sell its
share in Consol. The company has made no secret that it considers coal
to be a non-core asset. One source points out that reports of a
divestiture have been widespread since former DuPont chairman Edgar
Woolard said the company intended to buy back shares owned by Seagram
and to fund that with a sale of Consol.

In connection with the RWE-DuPont negotiations, there have also been
rumours that a third party will take a minority share in Consol. The
name of Cyprus Amax has come up in this connection, but it should be
remembered that Cyprus has been mentioned as a prospective buyer of
virtually every property on the block for the past six months. One
observer notes that a part-ownership of Consol by Cyprus Amax would be
illogical from an operational point of view as it would "paralyse" the
two competitors.

CONSOL ANNOUNCES REORGANISATION

Consol will eliminate three regional mining offices in a major
reorganisation resulting in the loss of an estimated 200-300 jobs. Also
at Consol, company president William Karis will take over Bobby Brown's
position as CEO, while Brown will stay with Consol to focus on
"strategic issues."

In the reorganisation, Consol will shut down its mining offices in
Washington, Pennsylvania; Morgantown, West Virginia; and St. Louis,
Missouri. Functions handled at these mid-level offices will be
transferred either to company headquarters in Pittsburgh or to the
mining operations themselves, a spokesman told ICR.

"We are trying to update our structure to reflect the character of our
company in 1995," the spokesman said. "The structure was put in place
in 1975, but we mine fifty percent more coal than we did 20 years ago
with fifty percent fewer mines."

The change will be effective as of February. There have also been
rumours that some of Consol's regional sales offices will close, but
the spokesman said he was not aware of any such plan.

Regarding Brown's new role, the company did not define the "strategic
issues" he will deal with, but his responsibilities may be related to
an upcoming change in ownership. The shift of the CEO position from
Brown to Karis follows a transfer of the president position from the
former to the latter in 1995.

AEP, COGENTRIX FORM VENTURE

American Electric Power, the largest coal-burning power company in the
US, has formed a joint venture with independent power company Cogentrix
and with Zurn Industries of Erie, Pennsylvania. The venture, called
Industrial Energy Partners, will focus on building IPPs selling
electricity beyond AEP's own service area, possibly including overseas.

The announcement was made in December at a power conference in
California. It reflects a decision by Ohio-based AEP to take advantage
of the deregulation of the US electricity industry. The venture
involves a non-utility subsidiary called AEP Resources, one of several
unregulated entities recently formed by AEP to pursue new power-related
markets. The parent company controls utilities in seven states in the
midwest burning about 45m short tons (st)/yr.

Cogentrix is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and operates
power projects in the US and overseas. It operates 10 plants in the US
and is currently working toward development of a $1.4bn power plant in
Mangalore, India.

Zurn is a manufacturer of equipment for power generation. It has
designed and built more than 40 generating stations over the past 10
years that are fuelled by natural gas or waste products.

PEN OWNERSHIP CHANGES

The evolution of an independent US producer continues with Pen
Holdings' announcement this week that controlling interest in the
company's common stock was sold to William Beckner January 3. Beckner
has been the company's president and chief executive officer since 1993
and has held various executive positions since 1982.

Pen, a privately held company located in Brentwood, Tennessee, was
originally formed in 1971 by Eddie Pen, who died February 6, 1993. His
wife, Grace Pen, has served as chairman of the company's board of
directors since his death. The sale was effected by Grace Pen and the
other co-executors of Pen's estate.

The company was originally known as P&C Bituminous Coal and was created
by Pen largely to do business with Taiwan Power. However, the company's
long-term contract supplies to Taipower have declined in volume at the
same time it has shifted toward domestic markets as well as export
markets outside Taiwan.

Pen has total revenues of more than $200m per year and employs 500
people. Its two largest subsidiaries are Pen Coal Corp. and Elk Horn
Coal, which control about 200m short tons of reserves in east Kentucky
and southern West Virginia.

RUHRKOHLE HOPES TO INCREASE STAKE IN GERMAN CREEK

Ruhrkohle International, a subsidiary of Ruhrkohle Handel, the trading
arm of German coal producer Ruhrkohle, wants to increase its share in
Australia's German Creek from around 12% to at least 20%.

Ruhrkohle International continues to scout the world for other
interesting investment possibilities. Any acquisitions are likely to be
small however after the investment of several hundred million DMs in
Venezuela since "Ruhrkohle is not a company with enormous financial
resources." Only those of the German state.

BF IRON OUTPUT SLOWS

Latest International Iron and Steel Institute blast furnace iron
production figures show a sharp drop off in November in European
activity rates. Indeed the institute's monthly analysis for the first
11 months of 1995 indicates a slowing across the board of the 43
industries surveyed. Although in Asia South Korea and Taiwan continue
to show growth, India, and significantly, Japan are both down - the
latter by 5.9% in November compared with November 1994.

CHINESE COKE SALES REACH 7MT

The rapid growth in Chinese coke exports could approach 9mt for the
whole of 1995, easily more than double 1994 sales. In October exports
hit a new monthly record with 890,000t shipped, bringing to 7.05mt the
volume moved in the first 10 months of the year (3.13mt in January
October 1994. Prices, according to Chinese customs authorities, reached
$80.52/t FOB compared with $67.39 a year previously.

Coal exports also look to be heading for another record year with
22.44mt moved in the first 10 months compared with 18.34mt in the same
1994 period.

FREIGHTS STAY QUIET

Deep sea freight rates are drifting with very little activity reported
in any sector. The Baltic Freight Index has slipped to 1,589, from its
pre-Christmas level of slightly over 1,600. Brokers report an
"absolutely terrible" cape-sized market and a not much better panamax
sector. Of the few spot fixtures reported, since just before Christmas,
capes from the US Atlantic to ARA ranged around $6.00. A cape in the
Pacific fetched $5.15 for a shipment from Queensland to South Korea.
The only Colombian business reported was for a 60,000t shipment from
Puerto Bolivar to Wedel in Germany at $11.25, whilst there was no
Richards Bay loading fixtures reported.

UMW INAUGURATES ROBERTS

The United Mine Workers of America swore in its new president, Cecil
Roberts, December 22. Roberts succeeds Richard Trumka in leading the US
miners' union and is expected to take an aggressive stance in
attempting to reverse the union's declining representation in the
industry.

Roberts has been active in the UMW since the 1970s and became a
leading figure in the 1989 Pittston strike while serving as vice
president of the union's District 17. He has worked as a coal miner
since 1971.
