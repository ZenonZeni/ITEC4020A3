         with the continuous progress we intend to make for patients,
         health care providers, our investors and our
         employees.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>SuperGen was founded to provide an
         increasing number of products that treat life-threatening
         diseases such as cancer, blood cell disorders and obesity.
         In just five years, we are well on our way to achieving
         leadership in this mission. Our company is absolutely
         focused on products and performance, and on the people and
         patents necessary to realize our vision for creating
         enduring long-term value. We invite you to explore and share
         that vision. </FONT>

         Inc. is a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the
         development and commercialization of products intended to
         treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and
         blood cell (hematological) disorders, and other serious
         conditions such as obesity. SuperGen is developing its
         anticancer portfolio of nine generic products and five
         enhanced or "supergeneric" products. The Company is also
         developing a group of proprietary blood cell disorder
         products for the treatment of anemia associated with
         chemotherapy, radiotherapy, renal failure and aplastic
         anemia. SuperGen's proprietary obesity pill, which has shown
         promise in early preclinical and animal studies for chronic
         genetic obesity, general obesity and Type II diabetes, is
         currently in Phase II clinical trials.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
