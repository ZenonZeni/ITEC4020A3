ND IL JUDGE DENIES
MOTION TO REMAND ROSELAWN
CASES TO STATE COURT

     U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo, while noting the "vague
and circuitous language" of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
(FSIA), denied on Nov. 17 the motion of plaintiffs in litigation
involving the 1994 crash of an American Eagle plane to remand
their cases to Illinois state court.  Air Crash Near Roselawn,
IN, No. 1070 (J.P.M.L.); No. 95 C 4593 (ND IL).

     The FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining U.S. court
jurisdiction over a foreign state.

     American Eagle Flight 4184 from Indianapolis to Chicago
crashed on Oct. 31, 1994.  All 64 passengers and four crew
members were killed.  Twenty-one suits were filed in Cook County
Circuit Court and removed to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois by defendant Avions de Transport,
Regional, G.I.E. (ATR), the manufacturers of the ATR-72-210
aircraft.  Plaintiffs then moved to remand the cases to state
court.

     Plaintiffs argued that the FSIA did not apply because ATR
was not an agency of a foreign government, but rather a private
corporation in which the governments of France and Italy have an
interest.  ATR countered that the interests of the two countries,
when "pooled," are sufficient to meet FSIA requirements.

     Judge Castillo held, "There is simply no sound policy
justification for reading the FSIA to apply to an entity majority
owned by one foreign state but not to apply to an entity majority
owned by two or more foreign states.  The sensitive concerns
raised by a federal court's exercise of jurisdiction over a
foreign sovereign are no less implicated in the latter context.
Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs' argument that pooling is
impermissible."

     The judge next considered the "tiering" of ownership
interests, noting that the two governments owned ATR through
intermediate corporate entities.  "Because we find that an entity
that is majority owned by an agency or instrumentality of a
foreign state meets the definition of a foreign state under the
FSIA, we further find that tiering of ownership interests is
perfectly permissible for purposes of determining whether an
entity is entitled to foreign state status under the Act," Judge
Castillo ruled.

     "Contrary to plaintiffs' contentions, we do not believe that
permitting both pooling and tiering, as we do in the present
case, so far removes the foreign state from the entity named as
the defendant as to unduly expand the scope of the FSIA beyond
that contemplated by Congress."

     Judge Castillo then held that in actions where the foreign
state is a third-party defendant, it may properly remove the
entire action, including the underlying action against non-ATR
defendants, to the federal court.

     The judge also ruled that the FSIA, under which the foreign
state is subject to a bench trial only, does not violate the
Seventh Amendment by conferring jury-immunity on a corporation
owned by  foreign states, and that plaintiffs are entitled to
jury trials on claims against the non-foreign state defendants.

     Judge Castillo said he will consider certification of the
ruling for interlocutory appeal to the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals.

     Plaintiffs' liaison counsel is Kevin M. Forde of Chicago.
Defendants' liaison counsel is Sidney I. Schenker of Jenner &
Block in Chicago.

WARSAW CONVENTION DAMAGES
LIMITATION MAY APPLY
IN COLOMBIA CRASH

     Although American Airlines was one of the carriers that
agreed to waive the $75,000 to $100,000 limit on compensatory
damages under the Warsaw Convention on international aviation,
whether the cap will be applied to cases arising from the crash
of an American flight at Cali, Colombia on Dec. 20 remains in
question.

     Members of the International Air Transport Association
(IATA) agreed to lift the Warsaw cap on Oct. 31, 1995, but
although 22 overseas airlines have signed the IATA agreement,
American and other U.S. carriers have not yet done so.  Those
airlines are attempting to work out a detailed agreement but
nothing has been finalized.  They must also receive approval from
the U.S. Department of Transportation.

     The Convention caps compensatory damages unless plaintiffs
prove willful misconduct on the part of the defendant airline, as
in the Pan Am Lockerbie cases and the Korean Air Lines Disaster
cases involving the 1983 shootdown of a KAL jet by the Soviet
Union.

     Claims against American are being handled by Robert L.
Alpert of International Claims & Litigation Management Group,
Inc.  American Airlines officials would not comment on the
matter.

     Lee S. Kreindler of Kreindler & Kreindler in New York City,
the lead plaintiff attorney in Lockerbie who expects his firm to
be involved in the Cali crash litigation, said American risks bad
publicity if it seeks to keep damages under the Warsaw limit
after agreeing in principle to lift the cap.  Kreindler told the
National Law Journal that American most likely will offer money
in excess of the limit.

     "The Cali accident has to be evaluated as a Warsaw case in
which the passengers will have to prove willful misconduct to get
realistic damages," Kreindler said.  "If it turns out that
American either breaks with other American carriers or Alpert
says, 'I tear up the Warsaw Convention,' then we may be
pleasantly surprised."

SHIPPERS SAY FEE AWARD
AGAINST CARGO AIRLINE
NOT A FEDERAL MATTER

     In an opposition brief filed Oct. 19 with the U.S. Supreme
Court, Georgia Pacific Corp. and BTL Specialty Resins Corp.
contend that attorney fees imposed against petitioner Burlington
Air Express in a lost cargo case were awarded under a Georgia
statute and not federal law, making Burlington's arguments
inappropriate for U.S. Supreme Court review.  Burlington Air
Express, Inc. v. Georgia Pacific Corp. et al., No. 95-560 (U.S.);
see Aviation LR, Dec. 26, 1995.

     Burlington contends that cargo airlines are not subject to
the Interstate Commerce Act and have been placed outside the
jurisdiction of any regulatory commission or agency by the
Airline Deregulation Act.

     Georgia Pacific and BTL (respondents) say the state court
award was based on evidence of bad faith and "stubborn
litigiousness" associated with their insurance claim on the lost
cargo, under a Georgia litigation expense statute.  That judgment
was ancillary to, but independent of, the underlying claim, the
respondents argue.  "The Georgia courts did not award Respondents
their attorney's fees and expenses under the Interstate Commerce
Act, the Airline Deregulation Act, federal common law, or any
other federal authority," the brief states.

     "A review of the Georgia decisions discusses the appropriate
federal law to apply to Respondents' claims, and Petitioner's
defenses, only on the insured values of the lost shipments.  If
Petitioner had wanted a clarification of the law on a claim
against an air carrier for lost shipments, the making of an
interpretation of shipping contracts, the limitation of tariffs,
and other defenses associated with air cargo carriers, Petitioner
should have sought certiorari on the appropriate judgment."

     Respondents contend, "There is no federal question
presented.  If Petitioner does not like Georgia law, it should
take care not to act in bad faith, or it should not do business
in Georgia."

     In affirming the fee award, the Georgia Court of Appeals
held, "Although deregulation took Air Cargo Carriers outside the
jurisdiction of any regulatory commission or agency, the body of
laws and principles expressed in the [Interstate Commerce] Act
continues to be applicable to air carriers as Federal Common
Law."

     In petitioning for Supreme Court review, Burlington contends
that the Georgia ruling essentially renders the Airline
Deregulation Act void in that state.  "Moreover," the carrier
argues, "this interpretation gives a preference to shippers in
Georgia by allowing attorney fees which are not available to
shippers in other states.  This is contrary to all of the Airline
Deregulation Act provisions and purposes."

     Respondents are represented by Everett W. Gee III of Parker,
Johnson, Cook & Dunlevie in Atlanta.  Burlington is represented
by Fred C. Clark of Clark & Clark in Savannah.

FAA SAYS FEE AWARD TO
REINSTATED PILOT
WOULD BE UNJUSTIFIED

     In a Nov. 21 opposition brief filed with the District of
Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, the Federal Aviation
Administration contends that pilot Richard Rolund, whose
certificate was suspended for 90 days by the FAA but reinstated
by the National Transportation Safety Board, is not entitled to
an award of attorneys' fees.  Federal Aviation Administration v.
National Transportation Safety Board et al., No. 94-1428
(DC Cir.); see Aviation LR, Dec. 26, 1995.

     The FAA charged that Rolund, flying for Wings West Airlines,
used Visual Flight Rules (VFR) when visibility was less than
three miles, and descended to 2,100 feet despite being ordered by
a controller to stay at 2,500.

     The NTSB reversed the suspension order, and the FAA's
petition for reconsideration was denied.

     The DC Circuit affirmed, holding that the FAA clearly failed
to articulate its own interpretation of the rules while arguing "
for the first time " that the NTSB should defer to that
interpretation.  A reasonable Board might also conclude, the
panel held, that the FAA had not shown that ground visibility was
less than three miles when Rolund took off.  The appeals court
also cited evidence supporting the pilot's assertion that he did
not hear the altitude instruction.

     Rolund now seeks $26,503 in attorneys' fees from the FAA
under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).  Under 28 U.S.C.
Section 2412, a prevailing party may be awarded fees and expenses
unless the position of the United States was substantially
justified or special circumstances make an award unjust.

     The FAA said it was substantially justified in seeking
review of the NTSB decision.  "The Board did not explicitly
reject as arbitrary or capricious the interpretation of the
regulations advanced by the FAA and affirmed by the ALJ at the
hearing; rather, the Board applied its own novel interpretation
of the regulations to the facts of the case.  The FAA took
exception, arguing that the Board's approach was inconsistent
with precedent and contrary to aviation safety," the FAA argued.

     "Accordingly, the FAA argued before this Court that the
Board erred in failing to defer to the FAA's interpretation of
the FAA safety regulations involved in the case."

     The FAA also said it was substantially justified in
believing that its interpretation of the regulations had been
raised before the NTSB.  Concerning the visibility at takeoff,
the FAA noted that its objection was to the Board's "novel
regulatory interpretation" that the official weather report was
not controlling as to ground visibility.

     "Accordingly," the brief stated, "the FAA was substantially
justified in advancing to this Court that the Board erred when it
failed to defer to the FAA's reasonable interpretation of the
regulation, as required by Board case law and 49 U.S.C. Section
44709(d)(3)."

     On the altitude change violation, the FAA argued that it was
advancing a long-standing interpretation of the applicable rule,
adopted through Board adjudication, which on its face requires
airmen to comply with a controller's instructions except in
emergency situations.  "The defense of 'I did not hear it' was
unacceptable in the absence of some reasonable explanation for
the communication not being 'hearable,' such as radio failure,"
the FAA contended.

     The FAA also said Rolund is seeking an unreasonable amount
of fees.

     Rolund claimed that the FAA's appeal was fatally flawed from
the outset, raising issues for the first time on appeal that the
agency had failed to consider in prior proceedings.  "It would be
difficult to conjure a more blatant abuse by the FAA of its duty
to consider the justification for its case.  This is exactly the
type of abuse which Congress intended to prevent by enacting the
EAJA," Rolund's fee application stated.

     The FAA is represented by Allan H. Horowitz and Clarence C.
Butcher Jr. of the FAA in Washington, DC.  Rolund is represented
by Mark T. McDermott and Peter J. Wiernicki of Joseph, Gajarsa,
McDermott & Reiner in Washington, DC.  On the original appeal,
Rolund was represented by John J. Veth of Speiser, Krause, Madole
& Cook in Irvine, CA; Gerard R. Lear and Rina M. Goodman of
Speiser, Krause, Madole & Lear in Rosslyn, VA; and John P. Burns
of Roger W. Calton & Associates in Laguna Niguel, CA.

INJURED PLAINTIFF WINS
$3.5 MILLION IN CA CRASH

     A California state court jury Dec. 15 awarded $3.5 million
to Michael Hamblin, injured in a plane crash that killed his
stepmother, DeAnna, and father, James, who was piloting the
aircraft.  Hamblin v. Redwood Aviation, Inc. et al., No. 206385
(CA Super. Ct., Sonoma Cty.).

     The jury apportioned 40% fault to James Hamblin, 40% to the
plane's owner and 20% to the aircraft lessee.

     The single-engine plane crashed in Lake County, CA, in 1992
after an engine valve failed.  Michael Hamblin suffered spinal
injuries and nerve damage.  He filed suit against the aircraft
owner, Falcon Aerial; the lessee, Aero Cartographics; maintenance
firm Redwood Aviation Inc.; valve manufacturer Superior Air Parts
Inc.; and the estate of James Hamblin, which held a financial
interest in Falcon and Aero.

     The parties disputed who was responsible for the faulty
valve.  After apportionment of fault, Michael Hamblin was awarded
$250,000 in economic damages, $1.25 million in general damages,
and $1 million awards for the wrongful deaths of James and DeAnna
Hamblin.  The three parties found at fault were covered by James
Hamblin's flight insurance policy.

     Michael Hamblin was represented by Warren Radler and George
Keller of Rivkin, Radler & Kremer in Santa Rosa, CA.  Falcon,
Aero and the James Hamblin estate were represented by James Irwin
of Irwin & Reilly in Los Angeles.  Redwood was represented by Lee
Danforth of Coddington, Hicks & Danforth in Redwood City, CA.
Superior was represented by J. Michael Bean of Maloney, Bean &
Horn in Irving, TX, and by Patrick Bailey, Maryann Marzano and
Carla Matta of Bailey & Marzano in Santa Monica, CA.

6TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS
REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATE
FOR FALSIFIED APPLICATION

     A Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel Dec. 13 upheld
the revocation of petitioner Michael Manin's pilot and airman
medical certificates for his failure to disclose a federal
conviction, finding substantial evidence that Manin failed to
properly disclose a 1992 conviction for falsifying a passport
application.  Manin v. National Transportation Safety Board et
al., No. 95-3589 (6th Cir.).

     Manin's certificates were initially revoked by the Federal
Aviation Administration in 1991 for fraudulently and
intentionally falsifying his applications for the certificates.
The order was stayed pending an informal conference.  A second
revocation order was issued in 1994 because Manin falsely
certified the lack of convictions on his 1992 and 1993
applications.

     The National Transportation Safety Board affirmed the FAA
revocation and denied reconsideration.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed, finding the NTSB decision
supported by substantial evidence that Manin had been federally
convicted before applying for his 1992 and 1993 certificates.
The panel also noted that Manin failed to perfect a timely appeal
of the 1991 revocation.
