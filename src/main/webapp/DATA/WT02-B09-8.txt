<p>Allan Suchinsky, a leading authority in the field of defense
and dual-use trade, has unparalleled experience in counseling
representatives of industry and foreign governments on export
licensing requirements and procedures. Prior to joining CSL
Associates, he served as a Branch Chief at the <a
href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a>&#146;s
Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC), where he was employed for
over 25 years.</p>
<p>During his tenure at the Department of State, Mr. Suchinsky
supervised over two dozen licensing personnel in the processing
of some 50,000 export license requests per year. He established
policies and procedures for case processing, and hired and
trained most of the licensing officers currently at DTC. He
specialized in assisting industry with the most complex,
time-sensitive licensing scenarios, and the development of
aggressive marketing strategies that adhere to U.S. Government
requirements.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky played an instrumental role in drafting the
current version of the <a href="itar.html">International Traffic
in Arms Regulations (ITAR)</a>, which governs commercial defense
trade. He chaired numerous special interagency studies on the
regulatory process and defense trade policy formulation. He also
represented the Department of State on numerous interagency trade
security working groups and served as DTC&#146;s primary liaison
to the intelligence community.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky was a key participant in numerous high level
negotiations of government-to-government strategic trade and
security agreements. He helped negotiate agreements with many
Asian nations (including the People&#146;s Republic of China),
Australia, Yugoslavia and Brazil. He also held the Department of
State chair on the U.S./Canada Security Subcommittee, and the
National Disclosure Policy Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky is a popular speaker on the regulatory process
and procedures for obtaining timely export approvals. He has also
written numerous articles on defense trade issues and co-authored
a book on the subject.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Electronic Industry Association presented Mr.
Suchinsky with its annual award for outstanding government
performance.</p>
<p>Mr. Suchinsky is a graduate of the State University of New
York at Binghamton, and served in the U.S. Army. He is a member
of the Association of Old Crows, and was previously a member of
the Board of Directors of the Society for International Affairs,
a defense trade educational organization.</p>
