<IMG SRC="../shared/sailing8.jpg" ALIGN="right">
During the nearly 25 years of  sailing and sampling the waters
along similar cruise tracks, SEA's faculty have developed a number
of ongoing studies in oceanography. These studies provide important
data on long-term trends and/or changes in water characteristics
and marine resources, and often form the basis for student research
on board <I>Westward</I> and <I>Corwith Cramer</I>. During every
SEA Semester cruise, these studies cover topics in all areas of
oceanography-physical, chemical, biological and geological, and
include both site-specific investigations and those distributed
over wide oceanic areas. In addition, SEA takes advantage of new
opportunities to investigate different areas of study, and, on
occasion, to collaborate with other scientists or groups interested
in a particular scientific question. SEA's time-series data sets
are unique. Few other institutions have the opportunity to sample
the same waters year after year.
<P>
Since 1988, SEA's shipboard scientific equipment has undergone
several major upgrades, beginning with a National Science Foundation
(NSF) grant to equip the <I>Cramer</I> with modern, sophisticated
sampling gear. Subsequent NSF funding brought <I>Westward's</I>
equipment into line with <I>Cramer's</I>, and further grants from
NSF and the Crystal Trust in 1993 have allowed SEA to furnish
the <I>Cramer</I> with a sampling rosette and hydraulic J-frame.
These improvements have made SEA sampling safer, have contributed
to the data quality, and have heightened the caliber of SEA's
academic programs.<BR>
The following are highlights from a variety of SEA research projects:
<BR>
<HR>

<H3>Tar Balls</H3>
Since 1980, SEA has been monitoring the distribution
of tar pollutants in the western North Atlantic. Tar is introduced
into the oceanic environment through accidental and/or negligent
loss of oil through the operation of tankers. Once oil enters
the water, its volatile elements evaporate leaving behind a floating
residue of tar that is distributed by wind and surface currents.
Dr. Paul Joyce has compiled SEA's data on floating tar collected
from 1980 to 1993. Examining a total of 2,143 neuston tow samples
taken from the western North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea,
he has found that floating tar distributions were controlled by
the circulation pattern of the North Atlantic gyre. SEA data reveal
that concentrations of tar were highest in the Northern Sargasso
Sea. The highest single tows were located near the Windward Passage,
an area of high water input into the Caribbean from the Sargasso
Sea, an area of high tanker traffic, and an area of convergence,
where large amounts of <I>Sargassum</I> and associated debris,
including plastic, are often observed. The lowest concentrations
of tar were found both in North American coastal waters and in
the Caribbean Sea.
<P>
Unlike earlier studies, in which floating tar in the western north
Atlantic and Caribbean Sea has consistently shown increases in
concentration or no significant change over time, SEA's data show
a decrease in tar density in the waters studied, particularly
in the Caribbean after 1987. This overall decrease in floating
tar is likely the result of a reduction of input. Although worldwide
production and shipments into the U.S. have increased, the number
of tankers in service has decreased, probably contributing to
the reduction in the amount of tar released into the Atlantic
Ocean. Data also suggests that legislation such as MARPOL Annex
1, which became effective in 1983, and improved tanker efficiency
and handling methods are showing measurable results in the Atlantic
Ocean.<BR>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="../shared/science6.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"><H3><I>Halobates</I>, the Marine Water Strider</H3>
SEA students and scientists continue to show interest in <I>Halobates
micans</I>, the only marine insect. According to Scientist Chuck
Lea, SEA's focus has shifted from the simple distribution of <I>Halobates</I>
to age distribution by geographic region. On two cruises every
year, SEA students and scientists are able to sample <I>Halobates</I>
entering the Caribbean from divergent, tropical, equatorial waters.
We would like to contrast these specimens with those which are
found in convergent, subtropical Sargasso Sea waters.
<P>
Recent work in the Gulf of Mexico has shown seasonality in the
occurrence of <I>Halobates</I>. SEA data may suggest whether seasonality
exists in the open Atlantic as well.<HR>

<P>
<H3>What's so special about Soufriere Bay?</H3> 
This deep bay on
the west coast of St. Lucia has consistently yielded large catches
of juvenile tuna. Folklore of the local fishermen offered several
possible explanations for this phenomenon: mineral run-off from
a nearby volcano; corals that thrive on the volcanically-derived
minerals; the moon and the &quot;cleanliness&quot; of the water
in the Bay. During SEA Semester Class 129 on <I>Westward</I>,
several SEA students, led by Chief Scientist Ellen Prager, conducted
a study under the auspices of St. Lucia's Ministry of Fisheries
in an effort to explain the Bay's large biological productivity
relative to other areas around the island. Data were collected
over a 24-hour period in Soufriere Bay, using CTDs, Niskin bottles,
neuston tows and sediment sampling techniques to gain as broad
a profile of the Bay as possible. While upwelling seemed initially
to be the likely explanation, data suggested rather that the primary
source of nutrients in the water was runoff from Soufriere River.
Daily mixing, possibly caused by a reversing current, may provide
additional nutrients from deeper water. This mixing appeared to
be distributing nutrients in the Bay and making its waters particularly
attractive to fish populations.<HR>

<H3>Cariaco Basin</H3> 
Cariaco Basin is a semi-enclosed, 1,400-foot
deep basin just off the northern coast of Venezuela. The first
samples were collected in this region in 1954 by Val Worthington
and colleagues at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who
found that although the surface waters were highly productive,
the Basin was anoxic below about 500 meters. Subsequent studies
showed the deep waters of the Basin to be unusually warm-close
to 18&#176; Cinstead of 6&#176; observed in waters of similar
depth in the nearby Caribbean. Many scientists have proposed different
ideas explaining this phenomenon. SEA began sampling there in
1991 during cruises W- and C-116, and have found that the waters
are continuing to warm. SEA has an outstanding data set from the
last several years of sampling, and these data show a temperature
increase during this period.<HR>

<H3>Gulf of Maine</H3> 
The 1994 SEA Summer Session (Class 134)
aboard the <I>Cramer</I> spent four weeks sailing and sampling
in the western North Atlantic and the Gulf of Maine. On board
for a portion of the cruise was visiting scholar Peter Brickley
from the University of Maine, whose research interests include
the flow of subsurface slope water into the Gulf of Maine. Guided
by Brickley and Chief Scientist Rich Malatesta, the students of
C-134 performed a precise, six-station CTD transect across a shallow
region in the Gulf of Maine called the Truxton Swell. Results
of the students' work showed regions of North Atlantic slope water
upwelling along the western portion of the Truxton Swell. This
is significant because, in Brickley's words, it &quot;corroborates
previous observations of 'banking' against the eastern slope of
the Gulf [of Maine], where German Bank rises up to the southwest
tip of the Nova Scotian shoreline.&quot; This work adds a piece
to the scientific puzzle that is the Gulf of Maine circulation
system.<HR>

<H3>Ciguatera, Tropical Fish Poisoning</H3> 
The human neurological
disease ciguatera results from the ingestion of toxin-bearing
tropical and subtropical reef fish. Feeding on benthic microalgae,
these fish may concentrate potent neurotoxins produced in small
quantities by certain attached dinoflagellates. Past scientific
studies determined that these dinoflagellates were associated
only with certain benthic algas. In collaboration with scientists
at WHOI, SEA students have been investigating these toxin-producing
organisms since 1991. SEA data, in agreement with other more recent
studies, indicate that the dinoflagellates are also associated
with pelagic <I>Sargassum</I> (floating seaweed). These findings
raise the possibility that the dinoflagellates, using <I>Sargassum</I>
as their substrate, are carried considerable distances from tropical
and subtropical regions by wind and surface currents. As a result,
the geographic range in which ciguatera can affect humans may
be expanding.
<P>
SEA students and scientists continue researching numerous topics
in the North Atlantic and Caribbean, ranging from ocean circulation
and water mass movements to studies of the abundance and distribution
of various species of zooplankton. Additional topics that SEA
alumni are familiar with include: Phyllosoma (larvae of the spiny
lobster), leptocephali (eel larvae), copepods and pteropods; pelagic
plastic distribution; Salinity Maximum Water, 18 Water, Antarctic
Intermediate Water, Amazon and Orinoco River Water; thermal fronts
in the Sargasso Sea: distribution and concentration of pelagic
<I>Sargassum</I>; and phytoplankton distribution and nutrient
availability.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="carousel">J-Frame and Carousel water sampler</A>
</H3>
The SSV <I>Corwith Cramer</I> and <EM>Westward </EM>have new looks
and new capabilities since the fall 1994 and 1995 yard periods
in Rockland, Maine. Thanks to a National Science Foundation grant
written by staff scientist Paul Joyce, additional funding from
the Crystal Trust, and a lot of hard work by many other people
(including former science coordinator Gretchen Rollwagen), SEA
was able to purchase and install a new water sampling system-a
CTD carousel.
<P><IMG SRC="../shared/carousel.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">
The carousel, manufactured
by Sea-Bird Electronics, is a state-of-the-art cylindrical frame
of aluminum tubing that holds up to twelve Niskin water sampling
bottles. Also attached to the carousel is the CTD, an electronic
instrument which measures the conductivity, temperature, and depth
of the seawater as it is lowered into the ocean; the data is stored
and later transferred to the lab computer for analysis. Students
can prepare the carousel for launching while the <I>Cramer</I>
is still underway to the station location. Once on station, the
carousel is deployed and lowered to the desired water depth, with
the CTD collecting physical oceanographic data on the way down.
As the carousel is raised, the Niskin bottles automatically close
at pre-programmed depths. The carousel is recovered, lashed down
in its cradle, and water samples extracted from the Niskin bottles
on the carousel while the ship gets underway.
<P>
The J-frame is the new launch and recovery system implemented
by consultant Bill Simpson, SEA's port engineer Robbie Laird,
and marine superintendent Wallace Stark. It is used not only to
launch the carousel, but also to deploy all other scientific gear
on the hydrowire. The frame has replaced the hydro davit on the
<I>Cramer</I>, and is a large aluminum structure shaped like an
inverted J, mounted on the ship's port rail. Hydraulics pivot
the J-frame in (with the hydrowire sheave attached), allowing
students and scientists to attach scientific gear-such as plankton
nets or the Shipek sediment grab-safely and conveniently. Once
the gear is attached, the frame pivots back out, keeping the hydrowire
and gear away from the hull of the ship.
<P>
Despite the newness of the system (a few SEA eyebrows were raised
when it was discovered we had received serial number 0001!), reports
were positive after its inaugural cruise, C-135, with Captain
Greg Lohse and Chief Scientist Tim Scott. The new system also
saves station time on deep hydrocasts: a 1,500-meter, 10-bottle
hydrocast required the ship to be hove-to for only 75 minutes,
about half the time it used to take!<BR>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="beach">Beach Profiles</A></H3>

In cooperation with the Falmouth Beach Committee, SEA has begun
a beach profiling program to monitor the changing contour, erosion
and sand deposition at four local beaches- Surf Drive, Wood Neck,
Old Silver and Menauhant. Permanent markers from which sand elevation
transects are taken have been established at each of the four
beaches. SEA students will monitor the beach profile several times
a year, measuring elevation from the backbeach to the water level.
Data collected will determine baseline elevations for each beach.
This information will allow Town of Falmouth officials to better
understand the seasonal erosion or deposition of sand at each
site, in addition to having a permanent baseline for mitigation
should major storm damage occur.
<P>
Classes are typically divided into three groups. The students
learn how to use the profiling equipment and practice conducting
profiles on one of the beaches. Each group is then assigned one
of the three remaining beaches to profile. Beach profiling began
in the fall with SEA Semester Class 136 students and scientists
as a field activity for SEA's course in oceanography, and will
continue with each subsequent semester class. Data collected will
be used for comparative purposes in the months and years to come.
