      What is a Class Action?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    It is a lawsuit where one or more individuals are claiming to represent all
    others who have been similarly injured by the same defendant or group of
    defendants. For example, suppose a defective computer diskette causes a floppy
    drive to ignite and burn once inserted. If 500,000 of those defective diskettes
    are sold, then the purchaser of one diskette might bring a class action against
    the manufacturer seeking to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers.<BR>
    <BR>
    A more detailed description can be found in the special
    <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23.htm">Federal Rule
    of Civil Procedure for Class Actions</A>.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Who gets the money in such cases?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    If the person who filed the class action prevails, any award or settlement
    must be made available to all members of the class. Attorneys representing
    the class are also entitled to a reasonable fee. Members of the class are
    not entitled to seek an additional award beyond that obtained by the class
    representative.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What if the defendant wins?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    A defendant who prevails in a class action is protected from further lawsuits
    by all persons who were members of the class at the time.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Why is notice important?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Notice serves three purposes.<BR>
    <P>
    First, potential class members need to be notified that a class lawsuit exists.
    The potential members must decide if they want to remain members of the class
    and be represented by the person who initially brought the lawsuit, or
    <STRONG>"opt out"</STRONG> of the class and do something on their own (like
    bring a separate lawsuit). Generally, if a potential class member fails to
    opt out, the individual is deemed to be a member of the class. Notice is
    necessary to inform class members of the lawsuit and of their ability to
    opt out.
    <P>
    Second, class members need to be notified of a potential settlement, so they
    can provide input on whether the settlement is acceptable.
    <P>
    Third, class member need to be notified when a pool of money or other award
    is available so they can participate and obtain their fair share.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What sort of notice is required?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Generally, courts are required to "direct to the members of the class the
    best notice practicable under the circumstances."
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Does this mean that I am entitled to receive notice if I'm a member of a
      class?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    No. The standard is "best practicable" notice, not "actually received" notice.
    There is no requirement of actual notice to a class member, only notice that
    is "reasonably calculated" to reach interested persons. If reasonable efforts
    result in <STRONG>no</STRONG> notice to you, tough luck.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What do you mean "tough luck"?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    You may totally miss the chance to collect on an award to which you are entitled
    <STRONG>AND</STRONG> you may have lost the opportunity to obtain legal relief
    for yourself.
    <P>
    Consider the case of Mr. Peters, a resident of New York who was injured on
    an Amtrak train following an accident. A class action on behalf of all passengers
    was brought in federal court in Philadelphia. Notice was mailed to the affected
    parties, but Mr. Peters' address was incomplete and he never received notice
    of the lawsuit.
    <P>
    Months after the class action was settled, Mr. Peters sued Amtrak seeking
    $500,000 in compensatory damage and $1 million in punitive damages.
    <P>
    Amtrak argued that Peters could not bring his lawsuit because he was bound
    by the settlement of the class action - he was a member of the class who
    had not opted out. He had lost the right to bring a separate lawsuit on his
    own. Peters argued that he was never given the chance to opt out because
    he had never received notice.
    <P>
    Amtrak won. (And on appeal, Amtrak won again.)
    <P>
    <FONT SIZE=-1> For you legal scholars out there, this case is <CITE>Peters
    v. National Railroad Passenger Corp.</CITE>, 966 F.2d 1483 (D.C. Cir. 1992).

    See generally, "<A HREF="http://www.dorsai.org/~jdadd/georgine.html">Lawsuits
    to End All Lawsuits, Settlements May Limit Victims' Future Right to Sue</A>",
    by Barry Meier, THE NEW YORK TIMES, January 10, 1996.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What type of notice efforts are considered reasonable?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Sending notice by mail is almost always considered reasonable. When addresses
    are unobtainable, notice by publication is often used. This means that class
    action notices may be published for one or two days in local, regional or
    national newspapers, and perhaps in a magazine.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What happens if I don't look at the right page in the selected newspaper
      on the day notice is published?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    You may never know that you are entitled to share in a class award. Or you
    may miss the chance to "opt out" or "opt in" to a class suit.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What do you mean "opt in"?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    In certain types of class actions an individual must affirmatively request
    to be included as a class member in order to take advantage of an already
    filed suit. For example, class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment
    Act (ADEA) are governed by the "opt in" rule.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Wouldn't it make sense to put class notices on the Web, where they would
      be continuously available to millions of individuals?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Definitely.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      <STRONG>Are most class action notices posted on the Web?</STRONG>
    </H3>
  <DD>
    No.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      <STRONG>Why Not?</STRONG>
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Lawyers and courts have only recently started to incorporate the Internet
    technology into their procedures and decisions. Also, up until recently there
    has not been a central location on the Web for posting class action notices.
