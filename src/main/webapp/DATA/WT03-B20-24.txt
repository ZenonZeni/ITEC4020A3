<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 216</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The Tata Conference<BR>
on Global Warming and<BR>
Climate Change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Tata Conference was the first international climate change meeting 
dedicated to <A HREF = "fs204.html">the concerns of 
developing countries</A></B>. Held in New Delhi from 21-23 February 1989, the 
Conference was co-sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP) 
and the US-based World Resources Institute.<P>
<B>The Conference Statement1 provides a detailed analysis of climate change and 
its impact on developing countries.</B> It calls for response measures in very strong 
and uncompromising terms, stressing the urgency of "aggressive action" by the 
international community. Among its many recommendations, the Statement advocates 
using fossil fuels more efficiently, introducing non-fossil fuel  technologies, <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">phasing out CFCs</A> by the end of the century 
and transferring substitute technologies to developing countries on a non-commercial 
basis, halting deforestation, and stabilizing the world’s population. <P>
<B>The Statement reminds industrialized countries that they bear most of the 
responsibility for climate change.</B> The Statement asserts that, "having caused the 
major share of the problem and possessing the resources to do something about it, the 
industrial countries have a special responsibility to assist developing countries in finding 
and financing appropriate responses." It calls on them to adopt measures for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and to provide technology and funding to enable developing 
countries to do the same.<P>
<B>Developing countries should participate in the international response to climate 
change. . . </B>The Statement notes that 20% of greenhouse gas emissions currently 
emanate from developing countries, and that this figure could climb to well over 50% by 
the middle of the 21st century. Consequently, developing countries are "potential 
contributors [to the problem] in the future and burden-sharers today." Developing 
countries should be particularly active in improving energy efficiency, pioneering the use 
of renewable energy, halting deforestation and moving toward net forest growth, and 
slowing population growth.<P>
<B>but economic development should not be sacrificed.</B> The Conference 
Statement addresses the potential conflict between development and the proposed climate 
change measures: "The developing countries’ contribution in response to the greenhouse 
challenge should be carried out in a way that enhances, rather than diminishes, 
development prospects. Where these are in conflict, priority should be given to 
development, which brings so many clear and needed benefits..." <P>
<B>The Conference Statement emphasizes the importance of research and training 
in developing countries.</B> It recommends setting up national climate monitoring, 
research, and management boards to coordinate research and implementation strategies.
