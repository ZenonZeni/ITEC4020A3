<H2>Research On Severe Mental Illness</H2>
By Carol Rees, Former NAMI Board Member
<HR>
	"Research on brain disease is the most exciting field that 
exists," according to researcher and NAMI board member Jill Bolte 
Taylor, Ph.D., in introducing plenary speakers Joseph Coyle, 
M.D., of Harvard Medical School; John Kane, M.D. of Hillside 
Hospital and Albert Einstein College of Medicine; and David 
Shern, Ph.D., director of the Bureau of Evaluation and Services 
Research, New York Office of Mental Health.  On Research Day at 
the NAMI convention, these researchers spoke of promising new 
discoveries, but also about the problems of stigma, uncertainties 
in healthcare financing, and mental health systems that fail to 
put into practice services that we already know will work.
<P>
	Dr. Coyle reviewed recent research on severe mental illness, 
stating that the function and structure of neuroanatomy in 
schizophrenia is now known.  According to Dr. Coyle, these 
advances in research were made possible because of the 
involvement of scientists who are able to build on foundations 
laid by basic neuroscience research and the new powerful 
technologies such as mapping of gene expression in the brain and 
mapping of brain function.  Researchers at NIMH have accomplished 
the steady erosion of the mind-brain dichotomy, bringing 
clinicians, behavioral neuroscientists, and molecular 
neuroscience together to solve the most elusive problems in 
medicine:  psychiatric disorders.
<P>
	Dr. Coyle observed that "While the NIMH suffers from all the 
problems of a Washington-based bureaucracy, it has accomplished 
amazing science.  I think it is now the time to stand by it."  He 
added that the ridicule of scientologists should be recognized 
for what it is--an attempt to stop research on the biological 
basis of psychiatric disorder.
<P>
	According to Dr. Kane, we are at a very exciting time in 
research in mental illness.  "There have been substantial 
achievements, and there is the likelihood that we can expect even 
greater achievements in the not-too-distant future.  At the same 
time, there are threats to our ability both to conduct research 
and to support the kind of integration that is necessary between 
research in mental illness and research in other areas of 
medicine."
<P>
	Dr. Kane pointed to exciting developments in genetic linkage 
studies and to the development of the first new drugs for the 
treatment of schizophrenia in 15 years.  Advances are being made 
in understanding abnormal brain function in disorders such as 
schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and panic 
disorder.  A tremendous amount of work has been done in relapse 
prevention in schizophrenia, and scientists are trying to better 
understand the strategies that are effective in preventing 
relapse and rehospitalization.
<P>
	Dr. Shern warned that changes being made by Congress are 
"shifting responsibility for the most vulnerable populations--
which includes persons with severe mental disorders--from federal 
responsibility for provision of services through Medicaid and 
other federal programs to states.  At the same time, states are 
changing their responsibilities, and medicine is becoming 
corporatized, privatized."
<P>
	"NAMI has made an enormous difference," said Dr. Shern.  
"[You have made an] enormous difference locally and nationally in 
focusing on the issues of persons with severe mental disorders 
and making systems become responsive to the needs of consumers 
and families."

<H4>Depakote Approved For Manic Episodes Of Bipolar Disorder</H4>

Depakote (divalproex sodium, a derivative of valproic acid) 
tablets--long a popular seizure medication--have been appproved 
by the FDA for the treatment of manic episodes of bipolar 
disorder.  Marketed by Abbott Laboratories, it is the first 
medication indicated for manic episodes associated with bipolar 
disorder in 25 years.  Significant improvement of manic symptoms 
was found in two, 21-day placebo-controlled clinical trials, and 
the rate of discontinuation in these trials was not statistically 
different between placebo, Depakote, or the active control.  
Depakote, which can begin alleviating symptoms in 10 days and has 
few side effects, offers an alternative to lithium, which has 
numerous side effects and can take weeks to work.  With FDA 
approval, insurance companies will cover it and more doctors will 
prescribe it.  Further information is available to physicians 
only at 708/937-2667.
<P>

<H4>Depakote Found Effective For Adolescents With Mania</H4>

Studying 15 patients over two years, George Papatheodorou and 
associates of Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Science Center found 
that valproic acid (Depakote) may be effective for treating mania 
in adolescents.  The 13 females and two males, 15- to 20-years-
old, had diagnoses of bipolar disorder, manic subtype, and were 
treated for seven weeks with Depakote, which was coadministered 
with other medications.  Among the 13 patients completing the 
study, eight showed "marked" improvement, four showed "moderate" 
improvement, and one showed "some" improvement.  Depakote was 
well tolerated by these 13 patients, who reported that somatic 
symptoms lessened by the end of treatment.  The researchers 
believe their work holds "initial evidence for the efficacy and 
tolerability of divalproex sodium in the acute treatment of 
adolescent mania."  ("The Efficacy and Safety of Divalproex 
Sodium in the treatment of Acute Mania in Adolescents and Young 
Adults:  An Open Clinical Trial," G. Papatheodorou, et al, 
Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology 155:2, 1995.)

<H4>Lithium May Help Some Children With Aggression
</H4>
	The psychoactive drug lithium appears to be effective in 
treating children with aggressive-type conduct disorder severe 
enough to require psychiatric hospitalization, suggests a study 
in the April 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of 
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  Lithium may be particularly 
helpful treating children with the affective or hostile subtype 
of aggression who have characteristic anger, irritability or 
rage, not necessarily provoked by any specific event.  In 
contrast, a "predatory" type of aggression is often brought on by 
specific stimuli.  The neurochemical basis of the two subtypes 
may be different, and the evidence suggests that the affective 
type may respond to lithium.
<P>
	In a double-blind study, 50 children diagnosed as having 
conduct disorder with affective subtype aggression were treated 
for six weeks using either lithium or placebo.  Each child's 
condition previously failed to respond to the usual treatments 
and was so severe that admission to a psychiatric hospital was 
required.  Following treatment, 68 percent of the children 
treated with lithium showed at least moderate improvement, 
compared with 40 percent of those receiving the placebo.  Forty 
percent of the lithium-treated children displayed marked 
improvement, compared to only 4 percent of the placebo-treated 
patients.
<P>

Adolescent Psychiatry, 202/966-7300.</I>

<H4>Antidepressant As Good As Ritalin For ADHD Kids</H4>
<P>
	The antidepressant bupropion appears to be as effective as 
Ritalin in treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), according to a study published in the May issue 
of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry.  Fifteen children between the ages of seven and 
seventeen were studied throughout drug treatment and a two-week 
"wash out' period during which they received no drug treatment.  
Both bupropion and Ritalin significantly improved attention and 
conduct in these children, as judged by their parents, teachers, 
and physicians.
<P>
	Both drugs produced similar improvements on a wide range of 
behavioral and psychiatric tests.  Where there were differences, 
Ritalin tended to be more effective, though differences were 
slight and considered insignificant.  There were few side effects 
with either drug.  Study findings suggest that bupropion is a 
useful alternative for those who either do not respond to Ritalin 
or who cannot take it due to allergy or side effects.  For 
further information, call the American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry, 202-966-7300.

<H4>Clozapine As A Mood Stabilizer?</H4>

Researchers Carlos Zarate, Jr., and associates studied a group of 
patients (nine men and eight women with a mean age of 39 years) 
with diagnoses of "bipolar disorder (manic or mixed)" or 
"schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type" who had been discharged 
from McLean Hospital while taking clozapine alone.  Eleven of 17 
patients (65 percent) had been rated (by raters blind to 
diagnosis and baseline data) "much" or "very much" improved 
(according to the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale) 
at the time of hospital discharge, when the patients' mean 
clozapine dosage was 182 mg/day).  Further, the researchers 
performed a variety of outcome measures by face-to-face or 
telephone interviews eight to 24 months after discharge and found 
that 15 of 17 (88 percent) were rated as much or very much 
improved on the CGI-I.  This occurred when the patients' mean 
clozapine dosage was 304 mg/day (and six of 17 had been started 
on adjunctive medication).  This follow-up also  found that 65 
percent of the patients had no "hospitalizations, affective 
episodes, or need of concomitant medications."  Although their 
study was retrospective, incompletely blind, and uncontrolled, 
the researchers believe that some patients with severe, 
treatment-refractory bipolar or schizoaffective disorder may 
respond to clozapine acutely and derive significant mood 
stabilization over the long term.  ("Is Clozapine a Mood 
Stabilizer?" C.A. Zarate, Jr., et al, Journal of Clinical 
Psychiatry 56:3, 1995.)

<H4>Promising, Unique Antidepressant Has Fewer Side Effects
</H4>
Recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Serzone 
(nefazodone HCI) is the first of a new class of dual-action 
antidepressants to produce the effects of both serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclics.  According to Jan Fawcett, 
M.D., professor and chair of Rush-Presbyterian-St Luke's Medical 
Center in Chicago, Serzone increases brain levels of serotonin 
(mood regulators) as the SSRI drugs do, and it blocks serotonin 
receptors like the tricyclics, specifically 5HT2, one of the most 
important depression receptors.  Although no head-to-head 
comparisons have been done, Serzone's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Company, claims that Serzone combines the optimum benefits 
of SSRIs like Prozac with an additional boost, fewer side-effects 
such as anxiety, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction.  It also costs 
10 percent to 20 percent less than other antidepressants.  
Clinical trials indicate that Serzone is as effective at 
alleviating depression as other drugs.

<H4>What You Should Know Before Participating In A Research Program</H4>

by Vera Hassner Sharav, quality of treatment chair, AMI-NYS
<P>
	Until safeguards for psychiatric patients in experimental 
research are improved and full disclosure requirements are 
universally implemented, we suggest that the following questions 
be asked by potential subjects of research, their families, or 
significant others, prior to signing consent forms.
<P>
1.  Is there an independent monitor (who is not connected with 
the research team) assigned to ensure that patient safeguards are 
followed?  What authority does that individual have?  How will 
this person ensure the patient-subject's continued consent?
<P>
2.  Who is authorized and available during off hours (i.e., 
weekends, evenings, holidays) for patients to contact in the 
event they wish to withdraw from a protocol.
<P>
3.  During participation in a research protocol, what services 
and activities are available to the patient?  Are these services 
part of the institution's normal rehabilitation and treatment 
program or are they available only to research subjects?
<P>
4.  Are drug wash-outs required?  For how long?  Is it a placebo-
control study? 
<P>
5.  If symptoms return and I am uncomfortable, will I be given 
medications immediately?  Who is authorized to prescribe 
therapeutic medications upon my (or my family's) request?
<P>
6.  Are non-FDA approved, investigation medications given in this 
protocol?  Is this study being funded by the pharmaceutical 
company?  If yes, ask to meet with a member of the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) to discuss the known and potential risks 
involved.
<P>
7.  If non-investigation drugs are involved, are these drugs 
approved (by the FDA) for my condition?  Ask for a photocopy of 
the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) reference discussing the 
risks and side effects of this medication and ask whether you 
will be given the standard recommended dose.
<P>
8.  If the drugs used in the study prove to be beneficial to me, 
am I assured that I will continue to be treated with the 
medication after completing the study?
<P>
9.  Are there procedures that involve radiation in this study?  
If yes, ask to speak to the chairman of the IRB to discuss the 
limitations of risks.
<P>
10.  Will this experiment involve any procedures that are painful 
or uncomfortable (e.g., injections or I-V studies, spinal taps, 
long periods of immobilization, sleep deprivation, dietary 
restrictions, bed/unit restrictions)?
<P>
11.  Does the consent form cover more than one study?  Is this an 
"umbrella" consent that will allow several procedures to be 
performed concomitantly or successively?
<P>
12.  If there are any therapeutic benefits learned from the 
protocol, will I and my family be informed of this in writing?  
Will my patient record indicate these beneficial findings for the 
purpose of follow-up care?
<P>
13.  What follow-up care is offered to patients who complete a 
study?  To those who drop out?
