<CENTER><H3>MEDICINES RESEARCH AND TRADE SURPLUS BOTH HIT &#163;2 BILLION RECORD - NHS SPENDING ON MEDICINES IS LOW, SAYS INDUSTRY ANNUAL
REPORT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry's spending on research and development
of new medicines in the UK soared to record levels last year,
figures published on 10 April by the Association of the
British Pharmaceutical Industry show.
<P>
But the UK is near the bottom of the league table in terms of
the number of prescriptions written and their cost per head to
the NHS - an average of nine prescriptions a year at an average
cost of less than &#163;9.
<P>
Publishing its annual review, the ABPI predicted that the UK industry
would break the &#163;2 billion mark in terms of trade surplus
in medicines for 1995 - a record surplus with exports of more
than &#163;4 billion, making medicines one of the top three export
earners for Britain.
<P>
Latest figures for expenditure on UK research and development
by the pharmaceutical industry show that in 1995 it also reached
a record &#163;2 billion - more than &#163;5 million every day
- and represented about 20 per cent of the UK's total investment
in R&amp;D. An analysis of the R&amp;D record of all major British
companies over a four-year period put five pharmaceutical companies
in the top 15.
<P>
&quot;While we continue to make an enormous investment in the
fight against disease - the UK-based pharmaceutical industry is
offering real value for money, to the benefit of the NHS, patients
and taxpayers,&quot; said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-General of
the ABPI at the launch of the association's Annual Review.
<P>
&quot;However, these figures do pose the question, are we making
the most of our medicines?,&quot; said Dr Jones. &quot;Cheap prescribing
is by no means always good prescribing, and it is important that
the benefit of medicines, and not solely their cost, are taken
into account when deciding how best to treat patients.
<P>
&quot;There is no doubt that major advances in medicines would
be adopted more quickly if there were a shift towards evidence-based
analysis of health treatments, supported by firm, scientific proof
of their effectiveness, and we support moves towards this. Medicines
are a real winner.&quot;
<H3>INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS</H3>

<P>
The role played by the pharmaceutical industry in attracting inward
investment to Britain is also highlighted by the report. During
1995, the merger of two British firms, Glaxo and Wellcome, created
the world's largest pharmaceutical company by sales and Britain's
largest company by market capitalisation.
<P>
Sweden's Pharmacia and the American company Upjohn also merged
and decided to base their international headquarters in Britain.
&quot;Their decision emphasised confidence in the UK as the location
of choice for many pharmaceutical companies,&quot; said the ABPI's immediate past 
President, Dr Till Medinger.
<P>
&quot;Many overseas companies are seeking to increase their investment
in the UK, which has long been regarded as a centre of excellence
in the pharmaceutical world. The future opportunities for the
industry, linked to the spectacular advance of scientific knowledge
in biotechnology and genomics, are more exciting than ever.&quot;
<P>
Several overseas companies increased their investment in the UK,
as the process of rationalisation in the industry continued. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc
Rorer acquired Fisons, after Astra had strengthened its UK research
base through the purchase of Fisons' research division, and BASF
took over Boots' prescription medicines manufacturing and research
business. There was a number of other mergers and acquisitions
in the industry.
<H3>PATIENT EMPOWERMENT</H3>

<P>
The industry's developing relationship with patients is reported
by the Review. To enable patients to take their rightful place
in the decision-making process for their own healthcare, the ABPI
and pharmaceutical companies recognise that they need to have
access to a full range of health information.
<P>
As well as the introduction of patient packs for prescription-only
medicines, complete with full patient information leaflets - a
three-year rolling programme began at the end of 1995 - the ABPI
also announced a new, voluntary scheme for its member companies
to make available more information to the public when a medicine
is licensed.
<P>
From January, companies have been opening up to the public for
the first time summaries of new licensing data submitted to the
Government as part of the medicines approval process, including
information on safety, side effects and the scientific basis on
which a medicine is approved.
<P>
&quot;For too long, the patient's voice has been disregarded and
I am delighted that the moves the ABPI has made to involve them
in the communication process have been greeted with such enthusiasm
by the patient groups,&quot; said Dr Medinger.
