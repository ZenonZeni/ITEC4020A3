COMPETITION IS FIERCE FOR LUXEMBOURG'S CARGOLUX


 By Bruce Barnard, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Cargolux, Europe's largest all-cargo carrier, doesn't have to
look too far to see the enemy.
     Within a 300-mile radius of its home base at Luxembourg airport are some
of the biggest players in the air freight business: scheduled carriers
Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and British Airways which have made cargo a core
operation. Federal Express, UPS and DHL planes also are flying into airports
less than a day's truck drive away, underlining the new challengers in the
battle for European cargo.
     Heiner Wilkens, president and chief executive officer of Cargolux,
meanwhile, insists the company is nimble enough to survive. The headline
figures show Cargolux is more than keeping pace with the competition. Last
year, it moved up three places to 17th in the world air freight rankings, and
to No.5 in Europe pushing ahead of both Swissair and Alitalia.
     Cargolux's bottom line also is looking a lot healthier after the savage
recession of 1992-93. A $4.88 million operating loss in 1993 was transformed
into a $10.7 million profit in 1994 as revenues surged to $307 million from
$241 million and traffic was up 39 percent at a record 182,000 tons.
     The surge continued in 1995 with an operating profit of between $16
million and $17 million.
     Mr. Wilkens arrived in May 1995 when Cargolux was on a roll, celebrating
its 25th year in business. In September it took delivery of its third Boeing
747-400 freighter -- a fourth is due in 1998 -- and was involved in the
negotiations for an "open skies" pact between Luxembourg and the United
States. And the market is booming, noted Mr. Wilkens, with a load factor in
excess of 90 percent.
     But he doesn't minimize the size of the task facing Cargolux. "To
maintain our existing market share we must grow every three years by an
amount equivalent to the capacity of one 747 freighter."
     This search for cargo is taking place in a fast changing environment.
Carriers like KLM say there will be at most three of four dedicated scheduled
cargo airlines by the turn of the century. Lufthansa and KLM are getting
closer to their big corporate customers to provide door-to-door transport and
logistics services, inevitably bypassing freight forwarders. Meanwhile, the
integrators are moving increasingly into markets that were once the preserve
of all-cargo and scheduled carriers.
     Mr. Wilkens isn't fazed. "We are a forwarders' airline. We will
concentrate on our core (air freight) business and trucking.
     "We don't want to go into the business of the forwarders...they are our
partners. As long as they don't want to get into the airline business we
won't go into theirs."
     In time, Cargolux could form alliances with some big freight forwarders,
but it will stick to what it does best -- hauling freight. That's why it
decided last June to go ahead with a $100 million plus order for a Boeing
747-400F.
     Mr. Wilkens, a 30-year veteran of the industry, doesn't think the
integrators provide the only viable strategy for the future.
     Forwarders, he said, can give customers services the integrators cannot.
An example: If a U.S. computer company wants to get components to a plant in
Europe by a certain date, a forwarder can arrange for cheaper sea transport
if the delivery schedule is known in advance.
     So far, Cargolux is staying ahead of the game with a 37 percent increase
in freight ton kilometers, more than double the industrywide growth of 15
percent. Its seven Boeings serve a network that spans the globe, and the
Asia-Pacific region, the fastest growing air freight market in the world,
generated 44 percent of its revenue last year.
     Cargolux also intends to build Luxembourg airport into a key European
hub. In March, it will open a new 50,000-square meter cargo terminal which
will double capacity to 500,000 tons a year. The warehouse cannot open soon
enough, with Cargolux fast running out of space. Last year air freight
traffic surged by nearly 37 percent to 252,000 tons, making this small
airport the 8th largest air freight center in Europe.
     Despite the bumper figures, Cargolux must continue its "relentless"
pursuit of cost cutting, according to Mr. Wilkens. Cargolux is a tight
operation with just 735 staff, of which around 550 are based in Luxembourg.
But it must boost productivity at one of the higher cost bases in the world
to compete against the low cost Asian and U.S. carriers. One way to remain
competitive is by flying the most efficient aircraft in the world. The lower
operating costs of the 747-400 more than outweighs the $105 million price
tag. "The 747-400 freighter has given us a clear edge in the market," Mr.
Wilkens.
     Industry executives say Cargolux has a gold plated guarantee of survival
in the 24.5 percent share held since 1987 by Lufthansa, the world's second
largest air freight operator, after Federal Express.
     There has been speculation in the industry that Lufthansa is keen to
take control of Cargolux to add an all-cargo arm to its freight operation
just as it added an integrator with the joint purchase with Japan Air Lines
of a controlling stake in DHL, the express and courier operator.
     For the time being, Mr, Wilkens "totally rules out" a takeover by
Lufthansa. It's been a good investment for Lufthansa, he says, yield an
average 5 percent return compared with 3 percent from Lufthansa's recently
independent cargo unit.
     The two carriers have a hands off relationship, focusing mainly on ways
to jointly have costs, for example, by sharing warehouses. Lufthansa also
books space on Cargolux's planes.
     Cargolux's local shareholders, Luxair SA, the national airline, and a
couple of Luxembourg banks, would also balk at letting go of the company.
"There's a national feeling about Cargolux. We are the big intercontinental
carrier for Luxembourg," Mr. Wilkens said. Indeed, Cargolux planes are the
most visible symbol around the world of this tiny nation of 370,000
inhabitants.
     Sometimes, it pays to operate out of a small country. Thus Cargolux
provided four of the six people in the Luxembourg team that negotiated the
open-skies agreement with the United States that came into force last June.
     The payoff for Cargolux came within days of the signing of the accord.
For the first time it was able to pick up local freight in Mexico for
transport to Seattle on its regular Luxembourg-Mexico-Seattle run.
     The battle for freight, however, is also being waged on the ground, with
air cargo companies battling the increasing challenge from door-to-door
integrators.
     Much of that battle is being fought on Europe's freeways where all the
major carriers are trucking cargo from all over the continent to their hubs.
Cargolux is keeping pace with the competition, with scheduled trucks carrying
bulk and containerized freight between Luxembourg airport and 35 airports in
Europe. Non-scheduled trucks operate services to over 80 other cities in
Europe. Last year. Cargolux's freight traffic rose by over 30 percent.
     In the air the toughest competition comes from subsidized European
carriers dumping freight rates and more scheduled carriers getting back into
freight to exploit the current boom. There is also the end of the tight air
freight capacity with the new Boeing 777s coming into service offering the
same capacity as a Boeing 747-100.
     But there will always be new business, according to Mr. Wilkens.
Computer companies are shipping components from manufacturing facilities all
over the world to a small number of assembly plants. And markets are forever
evolving: Ten years ago, Cargolux's business out of Italy was almost all
shoes and clothing. Today fashion makes up only 25 percent of its cargo, the
bulk now consisting of machinery, chemicals, auto parts, computers, printers,
telex machines and electronic goods.

SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY AIR VS. WATER: DECISION HINGES ON THREE FACTORS


 By Michael Goldstein, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Two hundred years ago, sailors died of scurvy if they couldn't get the
vitamin C from fruit that they needed. Voyages were long, ships were slow,
and fruit rotted without refrigeration. In an era of moldy hardtack, spoiled
beef and salt pork, the idea of shipping perishable produce from one country
to another was as alien as the thought of living on Jupiter.
     Thankfully, there's been plenty of progress since. From delicate
cherries and plums to fragile fresh flowers, highly perishable produce
routinely travel by air and sea to hungry markets a continent away. What
determines whether produce goes by air or ocean?
     Ron Rembaum, general manager for refrigerated cargo services at Maersk
Line, says, "At this point, the vast majority of fresh produce, everything
from bananas to cherries, can go by ocean. The only cargo that's really going
by air is the fruit that's most perishable. Berries do not move by water. If
it's sold as tree-ripened, like cherries from Chile, it goes by air. But
virtually everything else goes by ocean."
     Ocean freight rates for perishables should remain stable this year due
to increased competition from independent carriers like Hanjin Shipping Co.,
Hyundai Merchant Marine and Evergreen Marine Corp., all of which have made
big investments in fleets and reefer containers, he said.
     But revenue should grow about 5 percent due to higher volume, Mr.
Rembaum added. "The demand just keeps growing. Reefer cargo (like produce) is
the cream of the crop, and it pays more than dry container, so we've placed
our resources there."
     Air freight may be more expensive, but often it's the only way to ship
produce when it absolutely, positively has to be there on time.
"Perishability is the No. 1 reason, plus the value, because air freight is so
much more expensive," the Maersk executive said.
     "Some commodities can't go by air because of the price. Most fruits and
vegetables do not carry a high profit margin," he added. "Apples may be
high-volume, but not high-margin, and that rules out air shipping."
     Dave Moore, executive vice president of Raymond Express, a freight
forwarder in South San Francisco, Calif., that specializes in perishables,
said the commodities most likely to be shipped by air are the most
perishable, like cherries or strawberries.
     "These products can't go by ocean, where it's a long trip of 10 or more
days to the destination, so there'll be no shelf life when they get there."
     Market demand is the other key variable determining whether a product
goes by air or sea. That's especially true when the harvest has just begun
because demand is high and supply is low, he said, adding that fruit shipped
at the start of the season can command a premium price that will more than
pay for shipping costs.
     Ocean carriers are deploying a not-so-secret anti-aircraft weapon in the
form of controlled-atmosphere containers, which can slow the ripening process
and preserve fruits better than refrigeration alone.
     "Controlled atmosphere makes ocean even more competitive with air, but
everything relates to cost," said Mr. Rembaum of Maersk. But this method
costs the shipper over $1,000 additional per container.
     While the new technology hasn't caught on as rapidly as its developers
had hoped, it's becoming more and more common. A key reason is to cut down on
claims from the shipper.
     "We will not accept certain cargoes if we don't think they'll arrive
safely. If commodities like avocados or bananas have a transit time of 20
days, we think it will turn out badly, and we'll turn it down," the Maersk
official said. "When we carry plums or peaches from Chile to the Far East, we
will not accept them without controlled atmosphere. CA is extra insurance for
shipper, grower, and line, but the grower and shipper will have to pass along
the extra cost. And some produce, like citrus or apples, don't work under
controlled atmosphere all that well."
     Mr. Moore of Raymond Express notes that air freight tonnage, especially
to the Far East, has been consistently growing. While Hong Kong and Singapore
have slightly declined, other Asian markets, like Japan, are stable while
others are growing far faster than the European market.
     "Indonesia, and Thailand are increasing, with their increase in
disposable income, the lowering of tariffs, and the consumer's attraction to
fresh, healthy, foods," he said.
     Air freight rates to Asia have increased by 10 percent to 15 percent
over the past year because of strong demand and limited space for cargo on
passenger flights due to higher passenger travel. If prices get too high,
more traffic will move by ocean, Mr. Moore said. "The European market, for
example, except for the most highly perishable products, has flipped towards
ocean," he said. "The plum business used to be an air business, but now has
mostly flipped towards ocean, except for early harvest."
     Because air rates are so high, and because the demand is there, Mr.
Moore believes some ocean carriers may be able to raise rates. But, he adds,
"if the market continues strong, the carriers will add additional flights.
Eventually, the cycle will turn."
     Bill Spohrer, president of Miami-based Challenge Air Cargo, which
primarily ships to and from Latin America, said he expects rates there to
remain stable. That is helping Challenge's business, which is growing both
southbound and northbound, he said.
     Challenge's top item is fresh-cut flowers from South America, which have
a very limited shelf life and need to go by air.
     Ocean carriers are becoming more competitive with produce, he said,
noting that they recently dropped rates into Central America by 25 percent.
     "As various countries in Latin America improve their ports and roads,
maritime will play a bigger role. We move a tremendous amount of fresh
asparagus out of Peru.
     Some is now going by ship, which never happened before two years ago.
But the lion's share still goes by air, because it arrives in better shape
and much faster. Everyone wants everything yesterday." As ports are upgraded
to use technologies like controlled atmosphere, and faster ships come on
line, air carriers more efficient, and they'll offer better service. There
will always be a difference in price, but the air carriers can grow more
efficient."

PEACE DIVIDEND FOR ISRAEL? A MAJOR REGIONAL AIR CARGO HUB


 By Phillip Hastings, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The Promised Land may hold more promise than ever, as world
leaders raise the possibility of an accord between Israel and Syria. The
continuation of the Middle East peace process could pave the way for Israel
to become a significant air cargo hub for the entire region.
     The country might also have a similar role to play in servicing other
neighboring regional markets such as the eastern Mediterranean and parts of
the former Soviet Union. That, at least, is the optimistic view of local
Israeli air cargo industry executives.
     There are, of course, major stumbling blocks on the political front. A
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 and with Jordan
in 1994, has still to be followed by an end to the official state of war
still existing between Israel and Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.
     And while there is a momentum toward a settlement with Lebanon and
Syria, not even the most hopeful observers envisage a settlement with Iraq
while Saddam Hussein is still in power in Baghdad.
     If peace does come to the region, Israel will have to invest heavily --
and soon -- to expand its main airport and the nation's general transport
infrastructure.
     To that end, Israeli officials have earmarked $1 billion over the next
four years to Israeli ports, to allow them to rival in size the Persian Gulf
ports of Jebel Ali and Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
     Israel's basic underlying geographical advantage when it comes to
international trade and freight gateway activities is spotlighted by Michael
Mayer, cargo division director for El Al Israel Airlines.
     "If you look at a map you can see that Israel lies on a straight line
between key Southeast Asian centers like Singapore and much of Europe," he
said.
     The urgent need for further investment to enable Israel to exploit that
geographical advantage, though, is highlighted by the situation at its main
international air cargo gateway, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport.
     According to figures supplied by cargo handling company and terminal
operator Maman, annual air cargo traffic growth has averaged 8.6 percent over
the last five years. The final total for 1995 is expected to reach around
190,000 metric tons -- more than double the 1985 figure of 92,000 metric
tons. And that sort of growth, Maman said, is putting the airport's
cargo-handling facilities under pressure.
     "The number of cargo movements has increased to the point where we are
now having some difficulties giving the right levels of service to our
customers. We are short of facilities and need further expansion," admitted
Maman's senior deputy managing director, Isaac Tomer.
     Maman is hoping to get the go-ahead shortly for construction of a new
$50 million cargo terminal. The 30,000-square-meter facility, which will
virtually double the amount of cargo-handling space available, forms part of
a general "Airport 2000" expansion project at Tel Aviv that also includes
plans for a new passenger terminal.
     However, Maman said precise timing of the new cargo sector development
will be governed to some extent by recent court hearings into objections from
environmentalists.
     "We have the plans and the budget for the new cargo terminal project but
we do not yet have the land," Mr. Tomer said.
     "We hope to get that land by around May this year, with construction of
the building and systems completed by the end of 1997. That may be a little
optimistic, though." Current facilities include a main cargo terminal for
both imports and exports of 27,000 square meters, supported by two other
sheds of 6,000 square meters (for import consolidations) and 4,500 square
meters (exports and courier traffic) respectively. In addition, Agrexco
(Agricultural Export Company) operates a 5,000-square-meter terminal for
agricultural produce exports.
     Once the planned new cargo terminal becomes operational, Maman said, the
existing main building will be used solely for handling imports.
     Provided that development goes ahead -- and more Arab countries sign air
transport agreements with Israel -- Mr. Tomer believes Tel Aviv could become
increasingly interesting to international airlines as a potential regional
hub.
     "We have an advantage here in terms of position and direction. Airlines
flying into the Middle East from Europe and North America, for example, could
shorten their flying time by hubbing via Israel," he suggested.
     El Al's Mr. Mayer believes there are also opportunities for
transshipping air cargo moving between Western Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
     "It can make sense to route cargo from Western Europe to southern parts
of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), for example, via Israel. It
is not too much of a detour and there are a growing number of air services
between Tel Aviv and southern CIS points," he said.
     In that context, Mr. Mayer believes that the commonwealth states are
already emerging as a potentially important cargo market for El Al. "The
closest place in Russia, for example, is only two and a half hours' flying
time away from here," he said.
     El Al currently operates scheduled passenger flights to Moscow and St.
Petersburg, using both Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft with bellyhold cargo
capacity. It also is looking at other service development possibilities in
southern parts of the commonwealth.
     In March the airline is due to increase to twice-weekly its weekly 767
service from Tel Aviv to Tashkent in Uzbekistan. That move would put El Al on
a par with Uzbekistan Airlines, which already operates twice-weekly flights
on the same route.
     However, if Israel is to develop a general air cargo transshipment role
for the Middle East region, Mr. Mayer warned, then the country will need to
upgrade its rail and road connections substantially.
     "For example, the development of land links between Israel and Jordan
would open up the possibility of moving Jordanian air freight via Israel," he
said.
     Such development is already under way. At the beginning of the year,
Israel and Jordan agreed to allow their commercial trucks to cross each
other's territory. The same wide-ranging transport agreement also paves the
way for the introduction of direct air links between the two countries.
     The real prize, though, said the chairman of the Israeli Federation of
Forwarders and Customs Clearing Agents, Amir Shani, is the hoped-for future
establishment of trucking and other transport links between Israel and Arab
countries beyond Jordan, especially those in the Persian Gulf region.
     In addition to upgrading its freight transport infrastructures in a bid
to become a more significant cargo hub, Israel also is placing considerable
emphasis on its technological capabilities, particularly in the field of
communications.
     A prime example of that is the current move to develop a community
electronic data interchange system, IFTS (Integrated Foreign Trade System),
which will electronically link importers, exporters, public and private
freight transport organizations, customs and financial institutions such as
banks, along with other overseas communication systems.
     IFTS EDI center manager Shaul Abramovich believes that development of
more sophisticated communications systems will help the general growth of
Israel as a trade center in a number of ways.
     "We can foresee the development of international multimodal transport,
with goods arriving in Israel by sea or air and then being trucked on to
neighboring countries and further afield to the gulf. That will need to be
supported by sophisticated information systems which can plan and track the
movement of cargo," he said.
     He also noted the trend among multinational manufacturers and suppliers
to establish regional distribution centers where they can hold stocks close
to their customers.
     "By developing good EDI systems, we can assist those foreign companies
establishing regional warehouses in Israel to keep in close touch with those
operations and quickly access information about stock movements and stock
replacement requirements," Mr. Abramovich added.
     Overall, though, Israeli trade and freight industry executives admitted,
the development of their country as an international cargo hub remains very
much linked to the continuation of the peace process with its Arab neighbors.
Most appear optimistic that process will continue.

JAPANESE MARKET STILL STRONG FOR U.S. GROWERS


 By Mark Magnier, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     TOKYO--Feb. 26--Imported fresh fruits and vegetables will continue to do
reasonably well in Japan's affluent and demanding market in 1996 due to
changing consumer tastes and the declining number of Japanese farmers.
     "The prospects look real good," said John Child, agriculture counselor
at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. "Farmers are getting older and vegetables are
very labor intensive, so fewer are able to do it."
     That said, the American farmer's best friend will continue to be bad
weather. Japanese demand for imported fruits and vegetables rises most
sharply in years when Japan suffers bad weather and multiple typhoons.
     The last time that happened -- 1994 -- U.S. farmers saw enormous demand
for their onions and broccoli, the two largest U.S. fresh vegetable exports
here.
     In more normal years, U.S. produce exporters to Japan can expect
moderate growth.
     Japan's total imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from all sources in
1995 were estimated at $2.6 billion, compared with $2.37 billion in 1994.
     Fresh vegetables showed the strongest growth as Japanese consumers
respond to vegetables' perceived health benefits. Fruit -- which has seen
relatively little growth -- evidently doesn't have the same reputation.
     "Japanese fresh fruit consumption is modestly declining in favor of
juice," Mr. Child said.
     The United States, meanwhile, expects final figures for 1995 will show
total vegetable exports to Japan of $259 million, up $6 million over 1994.
The relatively small increase is partially explained by the huge jump in
import demand in 1994, which proved difficult to match. The United States
supplies approximately 29 percent of Japan's fresh imported vegetables.
     U.S. fresh fruit should see a healthy $864 million in total 1995 Japan
sales compared with $785 million in 1994.
     A year ago, the first shipment of Washington state apples in 24 years
arrived in Japan with great fanfare. But the great expectations that
Washington growers held for Japan have failed to materialize as demand has
proven to be rather mild. Japanese consumers, it turns out, find Washington
apples aren't sweet enough.
     In addition, Japan is still not ready to open its market to fresh
tomatoes grown in the United States, according to officials from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
     Concerns about a plant disease called the tobacco blue mold have held up
approval of U.S. tomato imports. U.S. tomato growers, however, argue that
Japan's domestic tomato industry would face no risk of a blue mold
infestation from imports of U.S. tomatoes. Washington may take the case to
the World Trade Organization.
     Nonetheless, U.S. officials in Japan say Japanese consumers are shedding
some of their traditional distrust of foreign farm products, which have
suffered from a perception that they contain more chemicals and harmful
additives than domestic varieties.
     Some U.S. products, like cherries, broccoli and asparagus, are now
mainstays in Japanese supermarkets.
     That's not to say domestic resistence to farm imports has disappeared --
particularly when it involves products as emotional to the Japanese as rice.
But some U.S. officials say domestic resistance is changing, with accusations
now more likely to come from fringe consumer groups than the farm lobbies
themselves.
     "It's still a major concern for U.S. produce suppliers," a U.S. official
said. "But it's not going to keep you out of the market."
     Other countries that have benefitted from Japanese fresh import
liberalization are China and Australia. China has done well exporting certain
Asian vegetables not widely grown by Australia or the United States.
     Australia has a seasonal advantage over the United States for fresh
fruit and vegetables. Because it's located in the Southern Hemisphere,
Australia's growing season complements rather than directly competes with
Japan's season.
     "We see good prospects for increased access and exports to this market,
particularly if Japan's economy recovers," said John Sainsbury, Australia's
agriculture counselor in Tokyo.
     On the other hand, when Japan does have a bad weather year, U.S. farmers
are in better position to take immediate advantage.
     As part of an expanded market presence, U.S. fresh produce exporters are
also trying to expand their distribution channels into this affluent market
by selling directly to regional farm cooperatives, secondary supermarket
chains and other emerging players in Japan's changing retail industry.
     U.S. farmers are also looking at new potential export products --
assuming they can get through Japan's laborious and expensive food safety
certification system. These include tomatoes, plums, new apple varieties and
peppers.
     Turning to the traditional large-volume U.S. exports to Japan, onions
saw an increase from January through October of 1995 relative to the
year-earlier period. But a slowdown in the last two months of the year means
the 1995 totals will probably be lower than last year.
     U.S. broccoli exports were up slightly to $114 million in the first 10
months of 1995 from $109.2 million in the same 1994 period.
     Two factors were at work here, U.S. officials say. Broccoli shipments
rose sharply in 1994 leading to little growth in 1995 as demand caught up
with supply. Also, higher competition toward the end of 1995, particularly
from Australia and New Zealand, meant that prices got squeezed.
     Asparagus declined in the first 10 months of 1995 to $32.9 million
compared with $33.5 million a year earlier.

MIAMI AIRPORT HELPING TO REINVENT CUSTOMS


 By Laura Myers, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     MIAMI--Feb. 26--Cutting red tape and improving automation are top
priorities for the U.S. Customs Service, and Miami International Airport is
right at the heart of those efforts.
     MIA's designation as a "reinvention lab" last fall by Vice President Al
Gore is speeding the creation of new systems to slash the time it takes
passengers and cargo to pass through Customs checkpoints.
     "We're working on every single process we have in Customs to see how to
cut down obsolete paperwork," said D. Lynn Gordon, director of the South
Florida Customs Management Center in Miami, one of 20 such U.S. centers.
     "It's a continuing process. Government resources are not getting any
greater. There's a constant need to reverse and redo, and we'll continue to
adjust. Traffic is up 10 percent to 15 percent a year here in Miami," Ms.
Gordon said.
     Part of Customs' efforts to help re-engineer the airport include
upgrading a computer system that checks passengers' names against a list of
known smugglers, terrorists or drug traffickers. Those identified through
computerization will be singled out for more thorough enforcement procedures.
Also under way is a plan to improve MIA's in-transit waiting areas for
foreign-to-foreign travel.
     "We're trying to improve communication with all inspection, airline and
airport personnel. Some of this has a lot to do with airlines and baggage
handlers or immigration. We want to make sure that everyone takes ownership
and joint risk assessments," said Jay Ahren, U.S. Customs Service Port
Director for MIA.
     As the hub for trade and travel with Latin America, MIA is poised for
continued growth as the nation's top cargo airport. International cargo last
year jumped 25 percent to just under 1.4 million tons. More than 14.4 million
international passengers traveled through the airport, a 10.2 percent
increase over 1994.
     Customs modernization changes allowed under the North American Free
Trade Agreement Implementation Act are helping to ease regulatory
requirements for the trade community.
     Customs' automated broker interface system is dramatically improving
productivity for Greyhound Leisure Services Inc., which recently renewed a
10-year contract to operate duty-free shops at the airport.
     The company has been able to eliminate 300,000 forms it previously had
to file with Customs, according to Phil Salta, customs document control
manager for Miami-based Greyhound.
     "The paperwork required by Customs is being done through more electronic
interfacing. It tremendously speeds up the availability of merchandise that
used to take six to seven days to get. Now, it's about 1.75 from the point of
entry," he said.
     Mr. Salta said that Greyhound, which sells liquor, tobacco, perfumes,
cosmetics, electronics, glassware and porcelain at MIA's duty-free shops,
will save about $300,000 during a three-year period by filing Customs forms
electronically.
     Bruce Roberts, vice president of operations for Miami International
Forwarders, which handles both air and sea cargo, said about 35 percent of
his company's 4,000 monthly clearance and follow-up entries are now
paperless.
     "The program has created benefits for us. We don't have to run out
paperwork for steamship lines, for example," Mr. Roberts said. "We can clear
and move cargo without submitting hard documentation to Customs or steamship
lines."
     Miami International Forwarders' clients include Epson Computers, Samsung
Electronics, Levi Strauss, Liz Claiborne, and Farrah.
     Customs' decision to eliminate the requirement for fences separating
domestic and bonded goods has won praise from the local trade community.
     "We had a huge number of good inside fencing. There was no need for the
physical fences and that's saved us at least $100,000. It used to be that
Customs was on Prozac, and the real driving force for change here has been
Lynn Gordon," said Raul Pedraza, president of the Eagle Cos. a Miami-based
international transportation and logistics company.
     Bonded carriers can now transport merchandise within seaport limits
without having to obtain a cartman's license, and operators of foreign trade
zones, container station and centralized examination stations and bonded
warehouse proprietors can transport merchandise to their facilities.
     "It's a form of privatization because we can transport goods under our
own bond," said Mr. Pedraza, past president of the 200-member National Bonded
Warehousing Cargo Association.
     "They've also allowed us to do entry processing electronically, all with
one check a month. It's really the first time that government has outsourced
regulations. Now, we have automated systems, with Customs in a supervisory
role. The streamlining has taken two weeks off the process and has gotten the
goods to move through the port more quickly," he said.
     Eagle has about 300 clients and $20 million in annual revenue from
handling electronics, cruise ship materials such as wines, table goods and
spare parts.
     Other Customs' streamlining efforts are continuing. Plans are under way
to redesign the agency's Automated Commercial System. Customs Commissioner
George Weiss in Washington also is seeking input from the trade community on
revising the Automated Commercial Environment User Requirements Document,
part of an overall Strategic Information Management Plan.
     In another move, U.S. Customs established five so-called Strategic Trade
Centers last October. They are located in Plantation, Fla., west of Fort
Lauderdale, as well as Chicago, Dallas, Long Beach and New York.
     "We're part of a new organization that is part of the streamlining
process. We try to ensure that there is informed compliance with importation.
It's a way of helping to protect the domestic industry," said Howard
Cooperman, deputy director of the 17-staff Plantation Strategic Trade Center.
"We're getting a much better handle on compliance rates."
     Functions of the new domestic trade offices include technical operations
and watchdogging predatory trade practices affecting the U.S. economy.
     Priorities of the five offices include embargoes, quotas, transshipments
and intellectual property rights.

JAPANESE AIR CARRIERS ADDING ROUTES


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways are looking to extend
their reach.
     JAL filed an application with local officials to operate flights between
Nagoya and Vancouver jointly with Canadian Airlines International, starting
April 1.
     According to the application, the two airlines plan to offer three
flights between the two cities in the first week and one more flight a week
for the period to Oct. 26. After that, they will reduce the number of flights
to two a week.
     JAL currently operates flights between Tokyo and Vancouver.
     Meanwhile, ANA submitted a plan to inaugurate a flight service between
Kansai International Airport in Osaka and Vienna on March 31 with Austrian
Airlines, ANA officials said.
     They will offer four flights a week -- two from Osaka to Vienna on
Monday and Friday and two return flights on Thursday and Sunday, each taking
about 12 hours.

AIRCOMMERCE THIS MONTH COLUMN


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--You know you are living in strange times when Atlanta can boast
worse winter weather than Anchorage, Israel and Jordan are deciding where to
sign a transport pact and airports are thinking of starting their own bank to
finance their needs.
     All those stories and a lot more can be found in this month's
AirCommerce.
     We begin here at home where this has truly been the winter of our
discontent. Record snows, ice storms and wind gusts that have seen
temperatures plummet to all-time lows have shown what can happen when a
creator has too many toys to play with. And yet, while bloodied and knocked
to one knee, North America's air transport system is, pardon the expression,
weathering the century's worst winter.
     Janet Plume tells how in this month's cover story, "A Winter to
Remember".
     Elsewhere, the Promised Land is looking more promising than ever. There
is a saying in the Middle East that roughly translates to "You get a chicken
by hatching the egg -- not by smashing it." It is a lesson in patience for a
region that has waited thousands of years for peace.
     Today, Israeli officials have taken a decidedly different approach, that
can best be described as "patience may be a virtue, but it will never help a
rooster lay an egg."
     Phil Hastings looks at the region's new peace initiatives and Israel's
aggressive approach to developing itself as the cargo hub for a region of
nearly 500 million residents.
     Lockheed's L-1011, once thought to be the airplane that would keep the
company in the passenger business, has found its niche as a cargo plane. Ted
Reed explains just where.
     Luxembourg's Cargolux Airlines is Europe's largest all-cargo air
carrier. It is also a company that doesn't have to go far to find the biggest
players in the air freight business looking over its shoulder, breathing down
its neck. Journal of Commerce European correspondent Bruce Barnard examines
Cargolux in "At the Center of the Storm."
     In neighboring Holland, Barnard explains how Dutch officials are looking
to protect their nation's interests and the jewel of the Netherlands'
transportation system, Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.
     Airports in the United States, meanwhile, tired of getting by on
government promises and little else are looking at creation of a National
Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank to fund their expansion plans. Ted
Gogoll explains.
     On the column front, Mark Lyons' Datalink examines America West's plans
to automate its cargo handling operations.
     Lisa Burgess in her Washington commentary asks and answers the question
of whether the time is ripe for a general overhaul in the way the world deals
with aviation rights.
     This month's Straight Talk column reviews the new "Business Consumer
Guide" report on the overnight delivery system. We also clear the smoke and
mirrors behind those lofty projections for third-party, contract logistics.
     Finally, this month we bring back an old friend in a new role. Charles
Thurston has been a regular contributor to The Journal of Commerce and
AirCommerce for a number of years. The author of "In From The Cold: How To Do
Business With Cuba" most recently was featured here in October as he examined
the efforts of Central and South American nations to invest and construct an
infrastructure straining under record cargo development. Today we raise the
curtain on Mr. Thurston and a new monthly feature column on the courier
industry.
     If you have specific questions or recommendations regarding the column,
Mr. Thurston can be reached through this office or direct at (212) 724-7060.

FIGHTING THE COLD WAR: A WINTER TO REMEMBER


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Not too long ago, the "Storm of the Century" meant massive loss
of life and property in a natural disaster from which thousands of victims
spent months or years recovering. These kinds of catastrophes, including
Hurricane Camille, which killed over 300 people in the South in 1969, or the
roaring tornadoes of 1974 that killed some 350 people across the South and
Midwest, wiped entire towns off the map.
     The winter of '96 included a January blizzard that stretched a thick
blanket of snow and ice across 17 states from Kansas City to Boston. While
lacking the tragic human and property losses of those earlier storms, many
still heralded the blizzard as the "Storm of the Century." Its greatest
legacy, however, will be as the storm from which we finally learned to cope.
     Today, in the era of instant media alerts and high-tech communications
forums, business and homeowners have substantially more lead time to prepare
for the worst of weather.
     The impact of January's record snowstorm was successfully minimized by
responsive networks in government and business that allowed the corporate and
public world to sidestep much of the damage before it occurred.
Municipalities in the Northeast banned motor traffic from city streets. Hub
airports shuttered their hangars, but opened emergency stations for stranded
travelers. Airports and carriers implemented emergency plans on the drawing
boards for months and in some cases years.
     Despite reducing the loss of life and property exponentially, the impact
of January's record lows and devastating icy onslaught was still widespread.
Insurers expect to pay out some $585 million in claims, making the storm the
most expensive winter blast since 1965, according to the American Insurance
Services Group Inc.
     Air carriers alone expect to incur up to $120 million in delays and lost
business, according to the Air Transport Association.
     Air cargo handlers expect to confront weather-related calamities as part
of doing business. But the Blizzard of '96 affected such a large part of the
country that no air carrier could ignore it.
     "This was similar in severity to Hurricane Andrew, but with ice," said
ATA economist Dick Swieringa. "It stretched over a big part of the country
that has an enormous amount of air travel and lasted several days, paralyzing
an entire system."
     Airports shut down from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with Logan
International setting a new record for its longest down time since the winter
of 1978. Snow drifts in central Pennsylvania reached 7 feet. Nearly 3 feet of
snow was reported at Baltimore-Washington and Newark, N.J. international
airports as well as New York's LaGuardia Airport. A state of emergency was
declared in some areas as winds gusted up to 60 mph along the Atlantic Coast.
Subzero record lows were reported from Kansas to Vermont.
     Transportation along the East Coast ground to a standstill.
     Chicago's O'Hare Airport, which never actually shut down but had
hundreds of flights canceled, rolled out its stranded passenger program for
six days, offering cots, blankets, pillows, travel kits, coffee and
sandwiches to more than 1,200 travelers, most of whom were headed east and
could get no further than the Windy City.
     "They came this far and couldn't get where they were going, and then
many of them couldn't get back to where they had come from," said Lisa
Howard, Airport Public Relations Director. "We called it Camp O'Hare."
     It wasn't just passengers who were stranded. At one point, O'Hare had
209 aircraft, many with cargo, sitting overnight on the ground that were
scheduled to be elsewhere.
     In Philadelphia, airport managers began planning for the blizzard on
Jan. 5, two full days before the storm hit.
     "We had our maintenance and snow removal people in place," said Phyllis
Van Istendal, Philadelphia International Public Relations Manager. "When we
saw this coming, we made plans to deal with it."
     Mr. Swieringa said the costs incurred by airports will eventually be
passed onto the users in the form of higher landing fees.
     "This storm was a very disruptive type of thing," he said. "But it could
have been worse. One thing we're seeing now is that with higher and higher
levels of automation within companies, they can recover more quickly and get
their aircraft back into position, be back on schedule more quickly than when
they had guys with green eye shades."
     Delta Airlines canceled more than 1,800 flights during the deluge of
snow and ice, according to Jackie Pate, corporate communications manager.
International flights scheduled for John F. Kennedy Airport were rerouted to
Atlanta, Cincinnati and Orlando, Fla.
     "The reason that cargo didn't suffer to the extent that the stranded
passengers did is that a lot of customers couldn't get to the airport so it
wasn't a case where we had deliveries piling up," Ms. Pate said.
     As the worst of the blizzard swooped down Jan. 7 on the East Coast, the
impact on air cargo movement was reduced because Sunday and Monday are the
industry's two lightest days, said Ed Martelle, spokesman for American
Airlines' cargo division.
     United Parcel Service implemented its winter contingency plan, which
included rerouting some shipments to nearby gateway airports -- such as
changing flights scheduled for UPS' main East Coast package-sorting
Philadelphia hub to Louisville, Ky. -- and trucking freight to cities whose
airports were closed, according to Jennifer Giles, a UPS public relations
manager.
     Even by using ground deliveries, the storm's timing enabled UPS to
deliver most packages that it picked up Friday to the destination airports.
Operations managers at UPS headquarters in Atlanta did encounter difficulties
gathering status reports on deliveries in the snowbound areas.
     "That's because all able-bodied management people were out making
deliveries," UPS spokesman John Flick said.
     Dave Fonkalsrud, spokesman for DHL Worldwide Express, said the
Brussels-based carrier had to be creative to get its shipments to customers
in New York City. On Jan. 9, city officials in New York banned motor vehicles
from city streets. Because a large number of DHL's customers are financial
institutions awaiting letters of credit where an extra day in delivery can
amount to a significant loss of interest, 60 DHL couriers devised an
alternative means of delivering some 6,000 shipments.
     They took the subway.
     Emery Worldwide's North American Sortation Center in Dayton, Ohio,
considered the January blizzard the second winter calamity of the season.
     A Dec. 14 snowfall was followed by a warming trend that created steam
and thick fog that prevented Emery planes from landing in Dayton.
     Tim Strauss, hub operations director, recalls employees going home for
the night and returned at 4 p.m. the next day to join the day-sort team to
process all the freight.
     "But by the time the planes were ready and reloaded, they required major
de-icing, which caused further delays," said Mr. Strauss.
     To compensate for an additional lost day, employees returned early again
on the third consecutive day to run an extra operation.
     Stealing a look at the calender, Mr. Strauss ruefully noted,
"Unfortunately, we haven't seen the end of this."

LATIN AMERICA'S GROWING TRADE BRINGS FINANCING INNOVATIONS


 By Joe Harkins, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Trade growth within Latin America is helping to spur
innovations in trade financing methods.
     "As regional trade opportunities are expanding, long-standing vehicles
(of trade finance) are not always relevant to the changing needs of buyers,
sellers, and the institutions which facilitate trade. We're hoping newer
systems will satisfy them," said Tom Noonan, president of First Meridian Bank
in Coral Gables, Fla. "Most trade between Latin American countries is
triangular," said Jim McCollom, executive vice president in the Miami office
of Banco Santa Cruz, a Bolivian bank.
     "The goods may move between Brazil and Bolivia, for example, but the
transaction will be financed from Miami. Virtually all such trade has been
dollarized. The institutions handling that financing are increasingly based
in the U.S. because that's where the dollars are," added Mr. McCollom, who is
also first vice president of the Florida International Bankers Association.
     That doesn't mean the financing is necessarily being handled by domestic
institutions.
     In the past, most Latin trade was financed through Edge Act banks, named
after a 1919 federal law that allows foreign and domestic banks to
participate in international trade finance. The debt crisis in the 1980s,
together with consolidations and mergers, caused many to withdraw from the
scene.
     However, some Edge Act banks are still around. Banco Santander
International and Standard Chartered Bank, for example, play a major role in
financing trade within the hemisphere. In explaining their continued
activity, one Edge Act Bank official, while declining to be named, claimed
they offer financing at rates less than half that of Latin American "agent
banks" operating from the United States under similar but different banking
laws.
     Mr. McCollom disputed that assertion. "Although Edge Act banks are more
likely to be dealing directly with both the importer and exporter, rates are
market driven. While there may be some unique individual situation, and I'm
not aware of any, the claimed differential does not exist."
     While most U.S.-based agency banks active in Latin America have their
roots there, some significant agents don't. Two of the largest, Barclay's
Bank and Deutsche-SudAmerikanishe Bank, are European.
     Mr. McCollom said agency bank volume is growing. "The numbers say
roughly $6 billion was in the system during 1995, but these were almost
entirely 90-to-180-day transactions, meaning the money turned over more than
once. I'd say that figure actually represents about $15 billion to $18
billion in trades."
     Meanwhile, paperless trading is also gaining ground.
     "Import-export finance is about to move off the printed page and onto
your desktop PC. This will eliminate most of the written documentation
currently required, and will end the delays, expenses, difficulties in
resolving inter-document discrepancies, the back and forth in making changes,
and the errors those complexities generate," said Guy Tozzoli, president of
the World Trade Centers Association Inc.
     The New York-based association plans to begin a three-month test of its
new Full Service Trade System in the United States, Taiwan and France in
July. Mr. Tozzoli estimated that it will take one and a half to two years
before the system is expanded to a worldwide basis.
     WTCA's 303 members, located in 89 countries, will supply traders with
software, security codes, pre-approved credit based on local rules, and
training in the system.
     "The funders could be banks, insurance companies or any other kind of
financial institution," Mr. Tozzoli said.
     Other concepts are winning attention, too. Tony Brown, senior vice
president and division head at MTB Bank's Trading Alliance Division in New
York, said new traders and small ones often find it hard to obtain financing
because banks wants to see assets and a strong balance sheet.
     "They turn away those who lack them. That's where we come in. We do
transaction-based financing."
     MTB will control the transaction all the way to the final buyer, Mr.
Brown said. "It's important for us to know all the parties involved. We are
rigorous in our examination of quality of the goods, knowledgeable in the
realities of the market for those goods, and attentive to other facts
normally of no interest to asset-based financiers."
     MTB will often buttress transactions with the participation of a
domestic correspondent bank, plus insurance against the consequences of
political interruptions and economic disturbances, he said, adding that this
may cost more than traditional financing.
     Transactions involving major capital purchases are also encouraging new
strategies. "Let's say a Canadian or U.S. firm is about to supply a power
plant or telecommunication system to a Latin American country," said David
Harris, president of New York-based Harris Corp. "Unlike consumable goods
finance, the time frame is five or 10 years. Historically, portions of this
deal might have involved the issuance of project-specific bonds which major
institutions would have bought, either for their own portfolio, or resale.
The prime potential source for such funds nowadays is the institutional
investor market, but so far an infrastructure is lacking."
     Mr. Harris suggested that the U.S. mortgage securities market could
provide a model for securitizing capital projects. "We're very interested in
encouraging such a structure for hemisphere transaction capital, and we think
the region offers the best opportunity to apply it."

AMERICA WEST SEEKS NEW CARGO SYSTEM ON THE AUTOMATION TRAIL


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--America West Airlines is once again the sweetheart of the
rodeo. Now she's lookin' for a cowpoke to take her to the hoedown.
     After several grueling years, the Phoenix-based airline surpassed its
revenue goal in 1995 by $25 million. This month, its stock has traded in the
neighborhood of $17 per share and close to its 52-week high of $19 and well
above the low of $7.675 a share. But hiding in the midst of this revelry was
a disturbing statistic: Following years of expansion, 1995's cargo revenue
growth was flat.
     Even before the year-end result was known, America West had begun
searching for ways to boost cargo revenue, says Tawn Downs, the airline's
cargo planning manager and acting director of cargo sales and services. Ms.
Downs would like to see double-digit cargo growth for 1996. This year, her
department will use a lot of its energy to boost its cargo sales and
marketing skills. To help this effort along, Ms. Downs wants to enhance
America West's cargo automation.
     "We were close to selecting a vendor for a new cargo system," Ms. Downs
says. "Then we decided to step back and re-evaluate our needs."
     In 1995, air cargo represented 3 percent of America West's revenue. Half
the cargo income was from U.S. mail. About 40 percent was general bulk
freight and the rest was airport-to-airport packages. All of the 65,000 tons
of freight flown was tendered loose. The pieces were individually loaded into
the airline's fleet of narrow-bodied jets and transported through its U.S.
route network.
     Automating the cargo activity for a passenger airline is a complicated
undertaking. Software engineers say it is more difficult than automating the
passenger system. And unlike the international air cargo business, where
space is usually booked in advance, most domestic freight arrives at the
loading dock without warning. The freight is loose, so the computer must keep
track of many shipments at one time.
     Also, the limited freight capacity of narrow-bodied passenger planes
tends to produce split shipments, which are harder to track. For example,
when a forwarder tenders a shipment of 150 boxes, it may be split into two or
more partial shipments that each travel on a different aircraft with a
different route to the final destination.
     Freight capacity is constantly changing. A load may be balanced between
passengers, baggage, mail and freight. Then, a last minute flight
cancellation will add dozens of new passengers and bags and the whole
equation has to be recalculated very quickly.
     Even though advanced bookings are not the rule in domestic traffic, the
system must still be able to reserve space for freight with guaranteed
delivery times and for special commodities like human remains that require
advance booking by law.
     Just to make things more complicated, America West is exploring new
freight products and handling methods that will effect its automation needs.
     Ms. Downs says the airline is studying the market for counter-to-counter
packages that weigh less than 100 pounds. This category of freight is growing
and produces higher yields than heavy freight. Since many of these shipments
are dropped off at the counter, ticket agents will need access to the cargo
reservations system and additional training in how to use it.
     So far, Ms. Downs has not been able to find a cargo system that suits
the airline's needs. "It has to be easy to use and easy to learn," she says.
"We cannot afford 40 to 80 hours to train a cargo agent. We must keep costs
down. On the other hand, if the system is not easy to use, agents won't use
it. That's a proven fact."
     Among other things, the ideal cargo system for America West must receive
information from the passenger reservation system in order to advise cargo
handlers of last-minute gate changes. It must communicate with the new weight
and balance system in order to facilitate flight planning. It must provide
strong general ledger and accounting services.
     It must report on utilization patterns by aircraft, by flight number, by
type of cargo. "If we don't know how we utilize aircraft in a particular
market, we can't maximize revenue," Ms. Downs says.
     Today, America West tracks cargo through an archaic system that resides
in its passenger reservations computer, Ms. Downs explains. It lacks
information on capacity and utilization. "It is not suitable for the way we
want to do business in 1996 and beyond."
     Ms. Downs is looking for a cargo system and has reviewed a number of
them. They either did not offer the right combination of features, could not
operate on America West's brand of computers, or could not justify their high
cost, she says.
     "People were saying a new system would reduce our freight claims by 60
percent," Ms. Downs reports. "That was supposed to save us big bucks. Well,
our claims are less than 1 percent, so I don't think so."
     Automation can also reduce the time agents spend on the telephone with
customers and the need to rekey shipment information at various stations.
"But I still don't see millions of dollars saved here," Ms. Downs says.
     "We ought to be able to buy software for a system like this for under $1
million," Ms. Downs says. "But I haven't found one product that does it all.
And all the other people I talk to in this business say they can't find one
either."
     Anybody want to sashay over to the hoedown?

FEDEX WEATHERED 'STORM OF THE CENTURY' FROM MEMPHIS, TENN., WAR ROOM


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Successful gamblers say the key to winning is preparation,
understanding the game, lowering the odds and leaving as little as possible
to chance.
     In the case of this winter's "Storm of the Century," some people might
think the nation's leading air freight carrier had luck on its side. Ken May,
Federal Express Global Operations Control and Coordination Manager, will tell
you his company was merely prepared.
     The 17 states from Kansas to the East Coast that were paralyzed by
record snowfall and subzero temperatures included FedEx's most heavily
trafficked routes. The blizzard hit three of its four U.S. hubs at
Indianapolis, Memphis, Tenn. and Newark, N.J. and affected 25 percent to 30
percent of its business worldwide.
     As the winter storm began its eastward march across the Great Plains,
Mr. May put a winter contingency plan, two years in the making, into effect.
     "We set up a war room in the control center in Memphis," Mr. May said.
"Any time from now on when we have a natural disaster, we will mobilize in
this war room with 25-30 people who represent different operating groups in
the company."
     The war room crowd talked through the situation and decided how to
handle it. Specialized software provided down-the-line effects of potential
scenarios.
     "We sat down and talked about what was facing us," Mr. May said. "We
started by shutting down the Indianapolis hub on Jan. 2, where they were
about to get 10 inches of snow."
     FedEx rerouted all 40 Indianapolis flights to Memphis, where employees
ran a second sorting operation after handling packages for the 120 flights
that normally arrive in Memphis every night. Packages were delivered on time
the next morning without a hitch. It was the first time FedEx had shut down a
major hub facility and moved the entire operation to another facility.
     "This blizzard was one reason that we decentralized several years ago,"
Mr. May said. "We realized what could happen to us if we lost our single
major hub during one of these catastrophes."
     By the time the blizzard reached FedEx's third hub in Newark, N.J., the
weekend had arrived.
     "The majority of our packages for Saturday delivery are handled in
Memphis," Mr. May said. "The packages Newark receives on Saturday are for
Monday delivery."
     But the New Jersey hub still faced an uphill battle. "They had time on
their side with the weekend," Mr. May said. "But manpower was the problem;
people had a hard time getting to work." Realizing the work force in Newark
was sorely short-handed, courier packs normally handled in Newark were
re-routed to Memphis for sorting. Newark employees were left to sort boxes.
     "I feel like we handled that storm flawlessly," Mr. May said. "We kept
our service levels high while we managed through it."
     Three weeks later, on Groundhog Day, when another icy blast howled into
Memphis, FedEx maintained normal operations while other airlines cancelled
flights.
     "We brought 120 airplanes in here and out that day with an average
departure delay of little more than an hour," said Mr. May.
     "We started planning for this type of situation last summer," he said.
"We spent a lot of hours drilling and training people how to keep runways
open in these conditions. We think it's paid off." FedEx has placed a $20
million price tag on business lost during the icy blizzard that buried the
Northeast this winter. The final cost of the blizzard of '96 will be higher
after FedEx adds in the extra expense it incurred coping with the storm. But
the innovative Memphis air freight carrier could have been hurt a lot worse
without its war plan, Mr. May said.

STREAMLINING CUSTOMS IS HEMISPHERIC GOAL


 By Maria Carlino, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The dizzying list of customs procedures and requirements
throughout the Americas has been a nightmare for exporters and importers.
     With the recent proliferation of regional trade pacts, customs officials
from Canada to Chile have joined forces to begin simplifying the maze.
Governments are working together to streamline paperwork and cut back on red
tape, expedite cargo clearance at border crossings, harmonize rules of origin
and rid agencies of fraud and corruption.
     For example, Canada, Mexico and the United States are poised to
introduce a prototype for standardized electronic documentation to clear
goods through customs at their borders. The Information Exchange and
Automation Working Group, a trilateral panel created under the 1994 North
American Free Trade Agreement, is spearheading the project.
     "The problem with our borders is not that free trade doesn't work. It's
the fact that we don't get information on these transactions until the
shipment arrives," said Robert Ehinger, director of international trade data
exchange for U.S. Customs.
     Under the program, the three countries would standardize trade data
gathered by customs officials to the point where cargo documentation arrives
at the border crossing before the truck or train does. This way, customs
officials would have enough information to decide whether to stop the
shipment for inspection or let it move through immediately.
     The procedure will apply to automotive parts, beer and liquor,
electronics, fresh fruits and vegetables, lumber, newsprint, steel, textiles
and apparel at two U.S.-Canada crossings and four Mexico-U.S. crossings. The
prototype was originally scheduled to be used in the field for a minimum of
six months beginning in January, but will probably not be launched until the
fall, Mr. Ehinger said.
     He attributed the delay in part to the U.S. government shutdowns in
recent months, adding that the schedule depends on getting the proper
technology in place along the borders.
     Officials are also working to develop a hemisphere-wide customs
procedures guide, one of the mandates trade ministers from 34 nations set
last June during a summit meeting in Denver to prepare countries for a
free-trade zone spanning North, Central and South America. The ministers will
meet again in March to work toward making hemispheric integration a reality
by 2005.
     In early February, the Working Group on Customs Procedures and Rules of
Origin, one of seven technical groups established during the summit, met in
La Paz, Bolivia, to start work on the guide. Group members also began
discussing ways to simplify customs procedures, identify areas for technical
cooperation in customs operations such as computerized networks and fraud
prevention as well as to develop a transparent system of rules of origin.
Origin rules, which determine where a product is made or what percentage of a
product is made in a specific country, are pertinent because countries use
them to determine the product's tariff treatment.
     A U.S. customs official who was present at the meeting stressed the
importance of "understanding that we're developing things the same way and
that we're talking about the same things."
     Several South American countries are following the same approach. "With
regard to customs, Mercosur is working hard to coordinate policies and
bureaucratic standards," said Eva Holz, a commercial law professor at the
State University of Uruguay Law School.
     Ms. Holz referred to efforts among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, the four members of the Southern Cone Common Market customs union
known as Mercosur, to harmonize complicated tariffs and customs regimes. For
example, "in the past, importers and exporters had to go through customs
paperwork with several different state agencies. The countries have agreed to
streamline this whereby you only have to go through customs," she said.
     In addition, Brazil, which has both federal and state regulations, has
made headway in simplifying requirements.
     Ms. Holz stressed that continued economic reform, especially in Brazil
and Argentina, Mercosur's two largest economies, would be key to pushing the
customs standardization process forward.
     Felipe Garcia, an adviser with the National Law Center for
Inter-American Free Trade in Tucson, Ariz., agreed, saying that more
open-door economic policies as well as the advent of high-tech customs
systems would facilitate the development of unified codes and practices.
"Because of technology and other factors this area of trade policy will be
easier to harmonize and change than others," Mr. Garcia said.

AS EXPRESS MARKET EXPANDS...AIR COURIERS PROLIFERATE


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Air courier companies are proliferating, and the permutations
of company-to-company cooperation schemes have reached a dizzying frenzy of
activity, especially now that the international express market is rising
above the one million shipments-per-day mark for the first time.
     With hundreds of players in the global market, the task of keeping up
with the scope of events, issues and trends in the express air courier
industry could keep even a prolific carrier pigeon tied to his typewriter 24
hours a day.
     This column, nonetheless, will make a noble, monthly attempt to visit
topics of interest to international couriers, to take note of those who
support their businesses, and to illuminate those who stand in their way. The
number of companies involved in this industry is large and getting larger --
the Air Courier Conference of America, in Washington, counts over 110
corporate members alone. And counterpart organizations elsewhere in the world
are expanding rapidly, too.
     As has often been the case with globalization, the expansion rate of the
courier market outside the United States is distinctly faster than within.
According to Air Cargo Management Group, of Seattle, the international market
for air courier express shipments is growing at a rate of 25 percent a year,
compared with a mere 15 percent domestic U.S. growth rate.
     Lee Hibbets, research director for the consultants' group, says
international shipments constitute about a fifth of the volume of daily U.S.
shipments, just nosing past the 5.5 million mark.
     But it will not take long for international shipments to exceed the U.S.
level. Carriers are moving into new regions, new countries and new airports
as fast as they can stencil a new "Open For Business" sign.
     In Latin America, a hot market for air couriers, a regional organization
working to remove trade barriers is the Conferencia Latino Americana de
Companias Express, or Cladec, which is registered in Panama. Among other
targets, the group is focusing on customs agencies to get them to modernize
clearing technology, encouraging national governments to lift surcharges, and
pressing congressmen to rewrite laws to facilitate air courier shipments.
"We've successfully worked with customs in several of the (South American)
southern cone countries," confirmed Susan Lyon, a spokeswoman for the Latin
American business of DHL WorldWide Express, a member of Cladec.
     Indeed, DHL has had such positive results over the last few months with
a pilot program in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru, that the
carrier plans in April to expand the billing decentralization program to a
total of 38 countries around the globe, she said. The new system permits a
factory manager in Peru, for example, to order parts or supplies from a U.S.
manufacturer and pay for the shipment through a local account, rather than
using the U.S. shipper's account, she explained.
     Cladec, in turn, is encouraging the formation of country associations
for air couriers throughout Latin America, to help galvanize change on a
local level. Thus far, 15 country associations have been formed in Latin
America, according to Larry Burtchaell, the executive director of Cladec.
"We're just getting started in the Caribbean now," noted Mr. Burtchaell, on
his way to Lima for a group meeting with a number of Peruvian officials.
     Since no single air courier can hope to have enough aircraft or
employees to serve every airport in the world, strategic cooperation is the
bylaw of this industry, in contrast with others. While DHL carries out a
recently announced $30 million upgrade of its hub in Panama, the company has
forged agreements with American Airlines and other carriers to handle its
express shipments in the southern cone of South America. "There must be 20
different (cooperative) combinations that companies use to get the materials
where they go," said Ms. Lyon.
     That's 20 permutations of the global combinations of several hundred
players in the market, each of which forms extended geographic networks that
are constantly shifting as the market expands and matures. Schedules and
pricing, of course, are easier to track.

DELIVERY OF PERISHABLES: IT'S ALL IN THE TIMING, TRANSPORT


 By Russ Banham, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The next time you munch on a peach and marvel at its freshness,
give thanks not just to Mother Nature. Modern technological advancements in
cooling and transporting perishables are keeping produce fresher longer.
     When it comes to perishable produce, two things are paramount: the
integrity of the cooling process and the rapid movement of freight. Three new
technological developments offer great promise in these areas: vacuum
cooling, improved temperature recording and satellite-driven tracking and
tracing of cargo.
     Vacuum cooling involves the extremely rapid evaporation of water from
fruits and vegetables. Even when produce is cooled, humidity can cause
degradation. Used for decades to cool iceberg lettuce, which is extremely
susceptible to cold water damage, vacuum cooling systems have only recently
been modified to cool other types of produce.
     In January, Lufthansa purchased a vacuum cooling system from Packaged
Refrigeration Systems Inc., a Jacksonville, Fla.-based manufacturer of
industrial refrigeration systems for its new perishable-cargo terminal at
Miami International Airport.
     "Vacuum cooling provides a better means by which perishables can be
preserved for transportation," said Mel Torre, a Lufthansa spokesman in New
York.
     "The problem with air cooling is that it's inefficient," said Stan
Badenhop, director of produce cooling equipment at Packaged Refrigeration
Systems. "You can't get the cool air to be in contact with the entire produce
pallet. If you have several boxes of fruit, for example, stacked on a pallet,
it's impossible to cool the central boxes, which are blocked by the adjacent
cartons."
     With vacuum cooling, produce is put on a conveyor and moved into a steel
vacuum chamber with doors at either end. The pallets are rolled in, the doors
close, the vacuum pumps turn on and the air is evacuated. The product is then
cooled to its optimum level. The process takes 45 minutes to an hour.
     Moving perishable commodities requires that they remain within a few
degrees of this optimum level of coolness. A new temperature monitoring
system developed by Ryan Instruments in Redmond, Wash., not only helps motor
carriers maintain the appropriate levels, but also provides a computerized
history of the freight's temperature.
     "Our new devices offer continuous monitoring of perishables throughout
the cold chain," said Dan Vache, a Ryan vice president. "At any time during
the cold cycle, you can download information telling you the temperature of
the freight at any given time."
     If a shipper sets the temperature gauge at 38 degrees for a particular
perishable product, and the temperature either drops below or rises above
that level, a red indicator light flashes. Downloading of the monitor's data
will indicate precisely when the temperature changed. The new monitoring
system is particularly effective in resolving disputes over degraded produce.
     "Let's say you have a restaurant in Los Angeles that wants its produce
delivered early in the morning and left out on the back dock," he said. "The
shipper gets the freight there on time, but the restaurant's workers show up
late to move it off the dock. The produce degrades in the heat, and
accusations fly."
     With Ryan's new monitoring device, a computer read-out of the
temperature data will reveal exactly when the freight dipped below the target
cooling level.
     Satellite communications is another new technology helping to meet the
just-in-time inventory requirements of fresh produce sellers and buyers.
     "If a receiver of produce has to have a load diverted, we can re-route
our trucks within minutes," said Jack Liles, president of the rail services
division at KLLM Transport Services Inc. KLLM, a Jackson, Miss.-based
refrigerated motor carrier, mounts satellites on the roofs of its trucks to
provide two-way communications. Each truck driver is equipped further with a
computer and modem, allowing the transfer of a wide range of data.
     The new system has been a boon to produce buyers, Mr. Liles said. He
recalled one shipper who decided that the temperatures set for a shipment of
tomatoes were too low. "The shipper called us and wondered if the
temperatures could be hiked up a bit," he said. "We contacted the driver, had
the temperatures changed, and called back the customer five minutes later."

U.S. AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS FLAT DESPITE NAFTA HOPES


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--U.S. produce exports were essentially flat last year despite
expectations that the North American Free Trade Agreement would bring a spurt
in growth.
     As U.S. growers expanded into the global arena, exports of fresh
vegetables inched up 3 percent to nearly 1.8 million tons in the fiscal year
that ended last Sept. 30, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
figures.
     Fresh fruit shipments, however, dipped about 1 percent to just under 2.7
million metric tons. Shipments to Mexico plunged 41 percent to 159,167 tons,
due to the peso crisis and economic turmoil there, while exports to Canada,
by far the largest market, fell 5 percent to 824,808 tons.
     Exports to Mexico have also been hit by a trade dispute stemming from a
U.S. ban on Mexican avocado imports.
     Growth in new Asian and Latin American markets, however, nearly offset
the drop in shipments directly north and south of the U.S. border. Tomatoes,
cherries, apples and other fruits have become hot commodities among an
increasingly Westernized population in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America.
     The virtual explosion of new trade opportunities has made consumer foods
the largest and fastest growing segment of global agricultural trade. The
market is now estimated at close to $200 billion worldwide.
     Lettuce, potatoes and onions led the list of fresh vegetable exports in
1995. More than two-thirds of all exported vegetables were shipped to Canada
last year. The United States' northern neighbor, whose colder clime and short
growing season limit fruit production, has slowed its imports from the United
States in the past three years.
     In 1993 when U.S. fresh vegetable exports reached a record, 40 percent
of those sales went to Canada and Mexico. U.S. exports to its two closest
neighbors had skyrocketed 1,000 percent since 1988.
     Fresh fruit and vegetable exports to some parts of Latin America
declined last year due in part to phytosanitary concerns. In November,
Ecuador shut its borders completely to U.S. fresh fruit and vegetable
imports, holding up shipments for two weeks until representatives of the
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service convinced authorities that the
crop-damaging Oriental fruit fly was discovered outside California's growing
regions and would not appear in imports.
     Sheena Kuruvilla, international trade manager for the United Fruit and
Vegetable Association, said Mexican agricultural leaders are using U.S.
exports as a political handball.
     "Mexico has said that if the United States refuses to remove barriers
against Mexican avocados, they will impose barriers against U.S. exports such
as apples," she said.
     Mexico has petitioned the USDA to permit avocado imports, which have
long been banned for sale in the United States because of inadequate Mexican
pest controls. Mexican growers argue they have substantially improved their
pest control methods and the U.S. ban amounts to a non-tariff trade barrier.
Florida and California avocado growers have campaigned against dropping the
ban. Mexican leaders have threatened to retaliate with bans on various U.S.
products.
     Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has indicated he would drop the ban
if the pesticide issue has been addressed.
     "Countries will use bad science to keep us out, but the rules have to
work both ways," Mr. Glickman recently told a public policy conference
sponsored by the Alexandria, Va.-based fruit and vegetable association, which
begins its annual conference today in New Orleans.
     Last month, Colombia, which buys the bulk of its apples and pears from
the Pacific Northwest, threatened to impose a fumigation requirement on all
U.S. fresh fruit and produce shipments.
     Colombia is the No. 3 market for Washington State apples, behind Brazil
and Mexico, buying some 444,000, 42-pound cartons last year. The region also
sent more than 60,000 cartons of pears to the Colombia.
     Colombian officials insist the Oriental fruit fly doesn't exist in their
country, and could be introduced in U.S. shipments. Argentina, Brazil and
Ecuador have passed similar measures.
     Colombian officials later suspended the fumigation order after U.S.
growers protested the practice. But they still require a special certificate
stating the fruit originated in a state where the Oriental fruit fly has not
been detected.
     U.S. growers are not eager to begin fumigating because the process is
costly and can damage the produce being treated.
     Ed Brooks, Latin American marketing director for the Washington Apple
Commission, said the Colombian fumigation requirement could have had a major
impact on sales.
     "Our fruit was more expensive this past season because of the smaller
crop," Mr. Brooks said. "It's difficult to stay competitive with other apple
producers such as Chile."
     Last fall's apple harvest in Washington State, which exports about
one-third of its apples, reaped 80 million boxes, down from 92 million boxes
in 1994. While the state produces about half the national harvest, it
accounts for 90 percent of all U.S. apple exports.
     Washington State's apple exports to Mexico shrank about 50 percent last
season to 4 million boxes. James Thomas, spokesman for the Washington Apple
Commission, said the devaluation of the peso and continuing economic turmoil
contributed to the decline.
     Asia is expected to become a major consumer of fresh foods over the next
five years as portions of the Uruguay Round are enacted, including subsidy
and tariff reductions.
     But California exporters are worried that customers such as Japan and
South Korea could cancel the $26 million in U.S. fresh fruit and vegetables
they buy each year if California growers lose an irreplaceable crop fumigant.
The sale of methyl bromide is scheduled to be banned in California March 30
along with some 200 other chemicals under a state birth defects prevention
law.
     Both Japan and Korea require pre-export fumigation with methyl bromide
on certain stone fruits and cherries. Considered to be damaging to the ozone
layer, methyl bromide is scheduled to be phased out of use in the United
States by 2001.
     Another hot market for U.S. fruit and vegetable growers is China, which
opened its market to U.S. apples in 1994. However, imported apples incur a 40
percent tariff duty plus a 16 percent value-added that tax keeps costs high
and volume low.
     Hong Kong is an important market for grapes and oranges, while Taiwan is
the largest importer of U.S. apples.
     The first shipment of Florida grapefruit since trade barriers came down
made its way to Thailand last year. U.S. exporters pay a 57 percent tariff,
which is reduced 3 percent each year. But 1996 exports of any of Florida's
produce are likely to become more expensive this year in the wake of a deadly
freeze that gripped the nation earlier this month. The rise in prices caused
by the shortages is likely to result in lower export volume, agriculture
officials said.

TRADE BATTLES CLOUD AGRICULTURAL IMPORT FORECAST DESPITE RISING DEMAND


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     NEW ORLEANS--Feb. 26--As the first baby boomers turn 50 this year, the
sex, drugs and rock 'n roll generation is turning to healthier living habits,
which is good news for fresh fruit and vegetable importers.
     Americans ate a record 100 pounds of fresh fruit per capita in 1994,
according to the Department of Agriculture. While final figures for 1995
haven't been released, that number is expected to be up about 15 percent.
     Fresh fruit imports were expected to approach 1.9 million tons last
year, up more than 16 percent from 1994. Fresh vegetable imports were
estimated to top 2.5 million tons at year's end, up some 14 percent from
1994's tally of nearly 2.2 million tons.
     Bananas lead the U.S. fresh fruit import crop, with more than twice as
many tons shipped into the United States as the combined total for all other
imported fruits. Melons, mostly from Mexico, and grapes, mostly from Chile,
rank second and third.
     Tomatoes, almost all from Mexico, rank as the top vegetable import,
followed by potatoes, which come exclusively from Canada and cucumbers, for
which Mexico is the only source.
     With consumer demand rising, the outlook for fresh fruit and vegetable
imports would appear to be rosy, boosting free-trade efforts on the road to
hemispheric integration. But U.S. farmers increasingly view the North
American Free Trade Agreement as a raw deal. Phytosanitary standards have
become major stumbling blocks among the 34 countries attempting to reach a
Free Trade Agreement of the Americas by 2005.
     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has been traveling the globe in
the past six months pressing countries to drop unscientifically founded,
anti-pest barriers to U.S. farm products. His leverage for making such
demands rests in part on proof that the United States itself is willing to
take the politically painful step of eradicating its own non-tariff barriers
to farm product imports.
     U.S. farmers, though, are loudly protesting surges in imports from
Mexico and Canada, arguing the increased supply drives down prices below cost
levels. Shortly before Christmas last year, Florida growers dumped hundreds
of pounds of beans, eggplant and squash into a parking lot to call attention
to the more than 50 percent increase in Mexican shipments of cucumbers,
eggplants, peppers, squash and tomatoes. Earlier this month, Florida
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford issued an order halting every truck in
the state carrying foreign produce and subjecting it to new health and safety
inspections.
     Free-trade proponents say the real problem with Mexican imports lies
with the collapse of the peso, making Mexican fruits and vegetables much
cheaper to sell in the U.S. market.
     The administration's push to lift an 81-year-old ban on Mexican avocados
is one such example.
     Last year, Mexico petitioned the USDA to lift the ban on its Haas
avocado, which was imposed because of Mexico's poor pest controls. Mexican
growers claimed they had gone to great lengths to eradicate pests and that
the U.S. ban amounted to a non-tariff trade barrier.
     Last July, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
proposed lifting the import ban, saying a study had concluded Mexican
avocados would not bring pests into California, where 90 percent of U.S.
avocados are grown.
     Florida and California avocado growers campaigned fiercely to keep the
ban. USDA received some 2,000 letters from growers protesting a change in the
ban.
     Rules set down under the Uruguay Round world trade agreement specify
that countries can't bar imports of agricultural products without a sound
scientific reason. Avocado growers claim imports would pose a high risk to
the U.S. crop, cited a University of California study last fall that
challenged Aphis' conclusions.
     The newer study concluded that certain species of fruit fly would
probably become established in California in three to 50 years after imports
began. Aphis had said the fruit fly wouldn't be established for 1 million
years.
     Advocates of lifting the ban argue the risk to the growers is economic
rather than a threat to the health of their crops. Mexican imports have
driven down prices of tomatoes, grapes and brussels sprouts this winter.
     Earlier this month, the Agriculture Department began moving forward with
plans to lift the ban and allow Mexican avocados to be imported into 19
northeastern states. Mark Affleck, president of the California Avocado
Commission, said he had confirmed the USDA was reviewing a final rule to be
issued by the office of general counsel.
     Mr. Affleck said his group would oppose the rule in federal court.
     Similar trade disputes between the United States and other countries
could be affected by the avocado controversy. Exporters of stone fruits in
California and the Pacific Northwest say their products are prohibited from
entering Mexico because of the U.S. ban on avocados.
     In Florida, tomato growers have vociferously opposed the increased level
of Mexican tomatoes entering the United States, which they insist amounts to
dumping. U.S. imports of Mexican tomatoes shot up 40 percent during the
12-month period between Oct. 1, 1994 and Sept. 30, 1995 to 534,345 tons,
which represented 96 percent of all U.S. tomato imports during that period.
     NAFTA allows Mexico to ship a certain amount of tomatoes to the United
States at reduced tariff rates. Once the quota level is exceeded, the normal
import tariff kicks in, adding about one-half cent a pound to the cost of
imported tomatoes. But the slow pace in measuring those imports in early 1995
produced a months-long delay in finding that Mexico had exceeded its quota.
The delay lasted long enough for the tomatoes to reach U.S. supermarkets.
     U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor proposed rectifying the
situation by measuring imports on a weekly basis rather than semi-annually
during each growing season, as is the current practice.
     Customs officials have warned they lack the resources to monitor tomato
shipments and alter tariff rates every week, and have speculated such a rule
could result in mountains of tomatoes rotting on U.S. borders.
     Mexican growers argue the natural peaks of the tomato season during
January and February and the unreliability of weather conditions cannot be
regulated to keep tomato shipments uniform throughout the season.
     Florida growers, who believe they have not received promised protection
from Mexican imports, argue the weekly quota would allow them to deal with
surges in imports that cause disruptions in their ability to set prices that
cover costs. Only a tiny portion of the Florida winter vegetable crop is
exported, so NAFTA -- which has received much stronger support from growers
dependent on exports -- has simply produced more competition for them.
     Mexican officials, who have denounced the bill as a protectionist bias
that violates NAFTA, have threatened retaliation against U.S. exports of
meat, grain and dairy products if Congress approves a bill backed by the
Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association. The bill would redefine who can
qualify for import protection under U.S. trade law and make producers of
"seasonal" perishable commodities eligible for relief.
     In California, U.S. table grape growers are considering levying charges
that Mexican producers have dumped their product on the American market.
Imported fruits and vegetables are normally sold for a price that is
predetermined by the importer and the wholesaler before the shipment arrives.
     Sometimes fruit is sold on consignment, when the shipper tells the buyer
to get whatever price he can. Domestic farmers contend consignment imports,
which skyrocketed last summer in California during grape growers' peak
season, destabilize the market by driving down prices. They also claim it can
provide growers a vehicle to divert large quantities of a certain product to
a specific market, which would constitute dumping.
     Growers contend Mexican bankers urged Mexican grape growers to dump
their produce on the U.S. market in 1995 after the peso's collapse. Imports
of Mexican grapes nearly doubled last year, rising from some 41,085 metric
tons during fiscal 1994 to 80,501 metric tons during fiscal 1995.
     California growers harvest nearly two-thirds of the nearly 2 billion
pounds of red, green and black table grapes consumed annually in the United
States. The bulk of the remainder is imported from Chile and Mexico.
     While much of the concern over U.S. imports stemmed from domestic
growers in the past year, an 11th-hour, 1995 decision by the California
Supreme Court scored a major victory for free trade.
     The state high court struck down an inspection fee collected since 1992
by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The Pacific Merchant
Shipping Association estimates the department will have to return nearly $3
million to shippers who paid the fees during the past three years on foreign
agricultural products. It's not immediately known whether the decision will
also affect similar fees that have been collected from airlines, who paid out
about four times as much as ocean carriers. A handful of domestic airlines
have filed lawsuits protesting collection of the inspection fees.
     Shippers had argued the fee was discriminatory because domestic shippers
didn't pay a similar fee when agricultural goods were trucked across state
lines.

INSURERS SOURED ON 1995 CHERRY CROP


 By Russ Banham, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Don Reynolds was pretty lucky last year despite losing more
than 60 percent of his cherry crop to bad weather. Unlike other cherry
growers in Lodi, Calif., his company, M&R Packing, was insured.
     Indeed, 1995 was the pits for California's sweet cherry industry. Heavy
rains throughout April and May decimated the fragile fruit. Growers ended up
shipping barely 500,000 18-pound packages of fresh cherries, down from about
3.8 million packages in 1994. "It was a disaster," said Mr. Reynolds,
co-owner and vice president of M&R, which farms cherries on about 400 acres.
     Serendipity, however, had knocked at his door only a few months earlier.
American Agrisurance Inc., a Fresno, Calif.-based insurer, decided it would
take the plunge and provide loss and damage insurance to the state's cherry
growers.
     "Thanks to American Agrisurance, we were able to collect about $2,500 an
acre for our losses," Mr. Reynolds said. "That money was a godsend."
     For American Agrisurance, however, the tremendous losses were a hellish
reminder of how risky the cherry insurance business can be. After just one
year of insuring cherries, the company has pulled up stakes, convinced the
fruit is uninsurable. "Right now we don't want anything to do with cherries,"
said Chuck Luna, American Agrisurance field representative.
     Mr. Luna explained that high cherry losses are only part of its decision
to call it quits. "The biggest problem is the reinsurance market, which won't
touch cherries for beans," he said. Reinsurance is bought by insurance
companies to help spread their risks.
     That creates a dilemma for farmers like Mr. Reynolds and others in
California. American Agrisurance was the only private insurance carrier in
the state willing to consider cherry coverage. "We had one insurer in here in
about 1992 or 1993, but then they lost their shirts and never returned," Mr.
Reynolds recalled.
     The U.S. Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency, which provides
insurance on almost every fruit and vegetable farmed today, won't touch
cherries either. "We had a program years ago, but we terminated it. Right now
there's no insurance for cherry growers," said William Murphy, regional
service director in the risk management division of the agency, which
replaced the Federal Crop Insurance Corp.
     While the government's Non-insured Agricultural Program (NAP) offers
post-disaster financial assistance to cherry growers, the criteria for
receiving funds is very stringent. NAP funds, which are limited anyway, only
kick in after 35 percent of growers in a county suffer a 50 percent loss of
their average yield.
     The lack of any kind of risk transfer mechanism for cherry growers is
nothing new, according to Jim Culbertson, manager of the California Cherry
Advisory Board, a quasi state-industry organization promoting the cherry
industry. "It's been a problem on and off for years," Mr. Culbertson said.
"Now and then, a courageous insurer like American Agrisurance will buck the
odds and offer insurance. But that's usually the exception, not the rule."
     Many insurers, such as Chicago-based CNA Insurance Cos., write cherry
insurance only if it's a small part of a large farm's business. "It's just
too volatile," said Lance Mallinson, CNA vice president of commercial lines.
"The loss ratios are horrendous."
     The vulnerability of sweet cherries is pronounced when compared with
other fruits. Cherries are highly susceptible to frost, rain and other
weather conditions. One of the most common production perils is rain near
harvest time, which causes "rain cracking," a condition encouraging fungal
infection.
     Exacerbating the problem is a high demand for dark red cherries,
especially among Pacific Rim importers. The darker the cherry the longer it
must remain on the tree before harvest. "Dark cherries almost invite
disaster," said Mr. Luna.
     The situation has become so grim for California's cherry growers that
they appealed to the federal government to reconsider its posture against
insuring the fruit. "We got together with the San Joaquin Agricultural Office
and various consolidated farm services offices in the state to ask the farm
services agency to reconsider cherries for an insurance program," Mr.
Culbertson said.
     Mr. Murphy said he received the growers' letter at an opportune time.
"We had just ordered a study on the feasibility of insuring sweet cherries,"
he noted. "The report (by the Economic Research Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture) indicated that such a program was feasible."
     The USDA report concluded there would be widespread participation among
sweet cherry growers in a catastrophic insurance plan -- if the premiums were
low enough and the benefits ample.
     "The conclusion is that sweet cherries are insurable, but the risks are
so significant that we will need to proceed with caution," Mr. Murphy said.
The next step in the process is a focus group meeting with growers in March
to determine their interest in participating in the insurance program, he
added.
     "We've got a number of different coverage plans that we'd like to float
to the growers to see which fits them best," Mr. Murphy said. "I'm hopeful
that come this cherry season, we'll have a program up and running."

U.S. EXPORTERS LOOK TOWARD NEW MARKETS IN THE PACIFIC RIM


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Canada and Japan dominate the U.S. fresh fruit and vegetable
export markets, buying more than half of all fresh fruit and vegetables
shipped out of the United States.
     While both markets continue to show promise of strong growth, exporters
are turning their eyes toward relatively new markets in the Pacific Rim where
many countries have experienced trade liberalization, rising incomes and
increased consumer demand for fresh products.
     Apples, oranges and grapefruit lead the U.S. fresh fruit export market
in that order. Approximately half the 663,054 tons of apples, 599,385 tons of
oranges and 481,744 tons of grapefruit that were shipped abroad last year
went to Asia.
     Japan, the largest net food importer in the world, is second to Canada
in overall imports from the United States and normally ranks as the largest
U.S. market for grapefruit, oranges, cherries and some other fruits.
     On another front, California exporters worry that some foreign customers
such as Japan and South Korea could cancel the $26 million in U.S. fresh
fruit and vegetables they buy each year when California growers lose an
irreplaceable crop fumigant. Next month, a state birth defects prevention law
will ban the sale of methyl bromide along with some 200 other chemicals. A
special session of the state legislature is considering repeal of the law.
     Both Japan and Korea require pre-export fumigation with methyl bromide
on certain stone fruits and cherries. Scientists believe methyl bromide
damages the ozone layer, and the fumigant is scheduled to be phased out of
use in the United States by 2001.
     "There is research under way to find viable alternatives," said Sheena
Kuruvilla, international trade manager for the United Fruit and Vegetable
Association. "If we are left with nothing else to use but fumigants, then we
will have a problem. But if we come up with a viable alternative it will
depend on how good that viable alternative is."
     China, which began importing U.S. apples in 1994, is another hot market
for U.S. fruit and vegetable growers. However, imported apples are subject to
a 40 percent tariff, plus a 16 percent value-added tax that keeps costs high
and volume low. U.S. growers also dislike the Chinese rule that requires
medfly traps in every warehouse where apples are stored for shipment to
China. Exporters say the traps are unnecessary because the medfly could not
exist in the Northwest's cold climate.
     The first shipment of Florida grapefruit since trade barriers came down
made its way to Thailand last year. U.S. exporters pay a 57 percent tariff,
which is reduced 3 percent each year. But 1996 exports of any of Florida's
produce are likely to become more expensive this year in the wake of a deadly
freeze that gripped the nation earlier this month. The rise in prices caused
by the shortages is likely to result in lower export volume, agriculture
officials said.
     The United States has been the major supplier of fresh fruits and
vegetables to Taiwan for several years. The top U.S. seller in this category
is apples, followed by grapes, plums, grapefruit and other citrus products.
U.S. kiwis have held onto a lead market share in the face of new competition
from French and Chilean imports, as well as from traditional New Zealand
suppliers. U.S. exporters nearly dominate the fresh onion, lettuce and celery
markets in Taiwan.

LACK OF FEDERAL FUNDS DELAYS MANY PROJECTS TO RELIEVE AIRPORT CONGESTION


 By Ted Gogoll, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--A consistent shortfall in government funding has forced U.S.
airports to seek alternative financing for needed projections and raised the
cry for creation of a National Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank.
     Airports that have traditionally relied on the Airport Improvement
Program (AIP) to fund construction projects have found a growing gap between
the money authorized by Congress and the actual funds legislators are making
available.
     The funds, which are distributed by the Federal Aviation Administration,
are used to improve and construct runways, taxiways, aircraft parking aprons
and to modernize safety and efficiency equipment.
     While the authorizations have annually increased, the amount of money
actually appropriated by Congress has decreased from a high of $1.9 billion
in 1992 to $1.45 billion in 1996, a figure airport officials say is
inadequate to handle their expansion needs. To meet the shortfall, airports
have had to rely increasingly on tapping the bond market, using passenger and
shipper fees.
     "We have done a periodic survey to find out what airports really need
over a five-year period. We consistently see that airports (collectively)
need at least $10 billion a year in capital development funding," said Rob
Wigington, senior vice president of Airports Council International-North
America, an organization that represents local, state and regional governing
bodies that own commercial service airports in the United States, Canada and
Bermuda.
     Even when the airports pool all of their financial resources, they still
fall short of necessary funding.
     "Congress is saying that airports are bringing in $3.5 billion in bonds
outside of the AIP, and the passenger and shipper taxes would bring in an
additional $1 billion a year with less than $7 billion in total. The airports
still need $3 billion more a year, but that's the best the (AIP) program
could do," said Mr. Wigington.
     According to the FAA, 22 airports in the United States have "serious"
congestion problems, experiencing more than 20,000 hours of delay a year.
These delays result in $32 million in added costs to airlines. The FAA
forecasts that, unless necessary capacity investments are made, the number of
congested airports will increase to more than 32 by the year 2006.
     Addressing the two-headed problem, FAA Administrator David Hinson said,
"We cannot afford the billions of dollars in annual delay costs and lost
productivity to the airlines, air travelers and businesses, nor can we afford
to weaken our economic competitiveness abroad, by permitting an inefficient
and inadequate air transportation system."
     Meanwhile, the lack of funding has placed many projects on the back
burner. The Airports Council International's Mr. Wigington placed the backlog
at about $8 billion, with some projects sitting on the shelf for upwards of
seven years.
     "When we apply for grants, we apply between October and January.
Generally, right after the first of the year, the grant will come
through...But these projects have been on the books for several years at the
FAA," said Chip Snowden, manager of aviation planning for Jacksonville
International Airport.
     Airport and airline officials note the problem of delayed construction
is not confined to cosmetic alterations but also involves important safety
projects.
     "When dealing with safety and efficiency of the aviation system, it
makes no sense to have to wait," said Mr. Wigington.
     A possible solution to the current budget problems has been proposed by
the Airports Council and the American Association of Airport Executives. The
latter represents executives who manage primary, commercial service, reliever
and general aviation airports in the United States. They began talks in 1994
to spearhead a National Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank.
     As envisioned, the congressionally established bank would be funded by
existing aviation taxes and user fees.
     "Given that aviation has a good flow of revenues, we could set up an
entity outside of the government process and generate sufficient capital in
the private-sector market," said Mr. Wigington.
     Currently, money is put into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund
(established in 1970), which is financed by taxes on passenger tickets,
domestic air cargo and noncommercial aviation fuel. The fund supports 70
percent of the FAA's operating expenses and also provides grants for airports
through the AIP. The NAIDB would take over a large part of the trust fund
duties.
     "It would be the sole way to fund the AIP, so that the trust fund would
no longer pay for the AIP but be funded by this infrastructure bank," said
Mr. Wigington. "The trust fund would pay for FAA operational expenses, so it
would separate the capital equipment programs and have it funded by the
bank."
     Supporters of the proposal stress that the bank would be created without
an increase in user fees on shippers and passengers.
     "It would be a very strong creditworthy entity because of its access to
aviation revenues," said Mr. Wigington. "We would be able to generate between
$14 billion and $25 billion over a 10-year period. That revenue stream would
come into the bank through various user fees.
     "The beauty of it is that we propose keeping the fees at the same level,
so there is no additional tax or fee burden...It is essentially privatizing
the funding. We would take the cargo waybill tax and leave it the way it is.
The private sector can do a lot more with funding, especially because the FAA
cannot go and borrow money (from the primary markets)."
     Under the NAIDB plan, the bank would serve to collect fees and handle
all financing, while the FAA would still make the decisions on what to buy
and when. In essence, Congress would still authorize all the funding, said
Mr. Wigington.
     Donna McLean, a spokeswoman for House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee's Aviation Subcommittee, said the subcommittee supports more
funding for airports but has reservations concerning the NAIDB and potential
budget problems.
     "There are a couple of problems with the bank, such as budget-scoring
problems. Basically what they are suggesting is using the user fees, and
(taking money) away from the trust fund, which we believe will cause
problems," said Mrs. McLean. "I'm not convinced that the airport system needs
to be borrowing money. If you look at your personal budget, you would borrow
money to buy a house or for one-time needs.
     "But when talking about the national airport system, you'll have
continual payments. In your personal budget, you wouldn't borrow to buy
food," she said.
     Mrs. McLean said that, despite the bank's potential, it probably won't
pass in Congress when it comes up for debate.
     "We will continue to look at this issue during the AIP reauthorization
discussion. We are certainly interested in discussing new approaches to
securing additional funding for the airports and other FAA programs. But,
initially, while (the plan is) appealing, the budget problems could mean the
bank proposal's downfall," said Mrs. McLean.
     The AIP is also preparing for its reauthorization, come this fall, as
its current two-year authorization expires. Hearings are set to begin on Feb.
29 and continue until March 20 to discuss the next AIP reauthorization
period.
     "We are not sure if this time around it will be a multiyear or a single
year," said Victoria Pannell, vice president of public affairs for the
Airports Council International. She said the AIP authorization will depend,
in part, on the still-to-be-determined financial status of the FAA's new Air
Traffic Control Corp.

STREAMLINING CUSTOMS IS HEMISPHERIC GOAL


 By Maria Carlino, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The dizzying list of customs procedures and requirements
throughout the Americas has been a nightmare for exporters and importers.
     With the recent proliferation of regional trade pacts, customs officials
from Canada to Chile have joined forces to begin simplifying the maze.
Governments are working together to streamline paperwork and cut back on red
tape, expedite cargo clearance at border crossings, harmonize rules of origin
and rid agencies of fraud and corruption.
     For example, Canada, Mexico and the United States are poised to
introduce a prototype for standardized electronic documentation to clear
goods through customs at their borders. The Information Exchange and
Automation Working Group, a trilateral panel created under the 1994 North
American Free Trade Agreement, is spearheading the project.
     "The problem with our borders is not that free trade doesn't work. It's
the fact that we don't get information on these transactions until the
shipment arrives," said Robert Ehinger, director of international trade data
exchange for U.S. Customs.
     Under the program, the three countries would standardize trade data
gathered by customs officials to the point where cargo documentation arrives
at the border crossing before the truck or train does. This way, customs
officials would have enough information to decide whether to stop the
shipment for inspection or let it move through immediately.
     The procedure will apply to automotive parts, beer and liquor,
electronics, fresh fruits and vegetables, lumber, newsprint, steel, textiles
and apparel at two U.S.-Canada crossings and four Mexico-U.S. crossings. The
prototype was originally scheduled to be used in the field for a minimum of
six months beginning in January, but will probably not be launched until the
fall, Mr. Ehinger said.
     He attributed the delay in part to the U.S. government shutdowns in
recent months, adding that the schedule depends on getting the proper
technology in place along the borders.
     Officials are also working to develop a hemisphere-wide customs
procedures guide, one of the mandates trade ministers from 34 nations set
last June during a summit meeting in Denver to prepare countries for a
free-trade zone spanning North, Central and South America. The ministers will
meet again in March to work toward making hemispheric integration a reality
by 2005.
     In early February, the Working Group on Customs Procedures and Rules of
Origin, one of seven technical groups established during the summit, met in
La Paz, Bolivia, to start work on the guide. Group members also began
discussing ways to simplify customs procedures, identify areas for technical
cooperation in customs operations such as computerized networks and fraud
prevention as well as to develop a transparent system of rules of origin.
Origin rules, which determine where a product is made or what percentage of a
product is made in a specific country, are pertinent because countries use
them to determine the product's tariff treatment.
     A U.S. customs official who was present at the meeting stressed the
importance of "understanding that we're developing things the same way and
that we're talking about the same things."
     Several South American countries are following the same approach. "With
regard to customs, Mercosur is working hard to coordinate policies and
bureaucratic standards," said Eva Holz, a commercial law professor at the
State University of Uruguay Law School.
     Ms. Holz referred to efforts among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, the four members of the Southern Cone Common Market customs union
known as Mercosur, to harmonize complicated tariffs and customs regimes. For
example, "in the past, importers and exporters had to go through customs
paperwork with several different state agencies. The countries have agreed to
streamline this whereby you only have to go through customs," she said.
     In addition, Brazil, which has both federal and state regulations, has
made headway in simplifying requirements.
     Ms. Holz stressed that continued economic reform, especially in Brazil
and Argentina, Mercosur's two largest economies, would be key to pushing the
customs standardization process forward.
     Felipe Garcia, an adviser with the National Law Center for
Inter-American Free Trade in Tucson, Ariz., agreed, saying that more
open-door economic policies as well as the advent of high-tech customs
systems would facilitate the development of unified codes and practices.
"Because of technology and other factors this area of trade policy will be
easier to harmonize and change than others," Mr. Garcia said.

DUTCH AIRPORT GIVES EQUAL STATUS TO CARGO, PASSENGERS; AIMS FOR MAINPORT

     Feb. 26--Transportation officials in the Netherlands, fearing
competition for air cargo from other transport centers in northern Europe,
have earmarked over $20 billion for improvements to Amsterdam's Schiphol
Airport.
     Unlike most airports, Schiphol, the home base of KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, gives cargo equal billing with passengers.
     Schiphol got final clearance from the Dutch upper house of Parliament at
the end of November for a 33 billion-guilder ($20.5 billion) expansion
including the construction of a fifth runway to increase the airport's
capacity to 44 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight annually by
2015.
     The plan includes high-speed passenger rail connections linking the
airport to Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt. The government is also supporting a
study for a 220-mile-an-hour rail freight service linking Amsterdam and Paris
airports via Brussels.
     Schiphol has a very clear idea where it wants to be at the beginning of
the 21st century: a mainport for Europe. The aim, according to Hans Smits,
president of Schiphol, is to become "a very sophisticated hub of traffic and
transport by air, rail and road, where optimum management of supply and
demand is the main element."
     Schiphol boosted its cargo business by 9.6 percent to 874,000 tons in
1994 as the fourth busiest cargo center in Europe.
     But that performance was eclipsed by Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport,
where freight surged by 17.6 percent to 898,000 tons, and London's Heathrow,
up 13.4 percent at 1.048 million tons. In fact, Paris and London easily
outpaced Frankfurt, which remains Europe's top cargo airport but grew by only
7.8 percent in 1994 to 1.402 million tons.
     The small loss of overall Europe market share was a setback for an
airport that regularly notched the fastest cargo growth rates in Europe in
the 1980s.
     Cargo figures are carefully studied by the Dutch, where Schiphol starts
with the disadvantage of a small domestic market of less than 15 million
people. Schiphol management, like KLM, has focused on transforming the
airport into a transit point for passengers as well as freight.
     Between 70 percent and 80 percent of freight passing through Schiphol is
bound for other destinations in Europe. And the airport is determined it will
continue handling this "foreign" freight. It takes less than five hours to
clear cargo through Schiphol, compared with 12 to 15 hours at Paris and
Frankfurt.
     One of Schiphol's major assets is KLM, which has made cargo a core
activity. The airline is among a handful of European carriers committed to
the handling of freight through the end of the century.
     A substantial share of Schiphol's cargo arrives by truck from points
across the continent. KLM recently opened its fourth European "minihub," this
one in Zaragosa, northern Spain. It also flies in freight from Manchester,
Malmo, Sweden, and Linz, Austria and has a trucking link with London.
     This dedication, allied to a global surge in air freight movements,
helped Schiphol to raise cargo traffic by 16.5 percent to 473,000 tons in the
first half of 1995, nearly twice the 8.8 percent rise in passenger traffic it
realized in the same period.
     Schiphol planners forecast that both intercontinental passenger and
freight traffic will increase on a small number of European hub airports
served by an equally select breed of scheduled airlines, integrators and
all-cargo carriers.
     On current trends, Schiphol is likely to hold its place among the
world's busiest cargo centers well into the 21st century. There is a huge gap
between Schiphol's fourth place in the cargo rankings and fifth-place Zurich,
which handled just 337,000 tons in 1994.
     But Schiphol's planners say a challenger can make its mark extremely
rapidly. Nearby Brussels, with its ample spare capacity, is an obvious
threat, particularly after Swissair, a dedicated cargo player, acquired a 49
percent stake in Sabena, the Belgian national carrier based at Brussels
Zaventem airport.
     Schiphol isn't taking any chances. It is selling itself as a
distribution point for companies and a center for information and data
communications flows.
     The airport has also forged a marketing alliance with nearby Rotterdam,
the world's biggest seaport, with the appointment of a joint representative
in Tokyo. The Netherlands has already been extremely successful in the
Japanese market: Some 42 percent of all Japanese companies in Europe have
located their operations in the country.
     Looking ahead, Mr. Smits ponders whether Schiphol should consider
alliances with other airport-based companies, to build a new mainport. "A
mainport is no location, it is a major enterprise. It does not think
nationally, but internationally," he said.
