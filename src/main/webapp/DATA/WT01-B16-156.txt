<P>Redux, also called dexfenfluramine, &nbsp;is now available with a prescription
in the US. It is useful for weight loss and maintenance of weigh loss. It
has been used in other countries since 1985. It is a seratonin reuptake inhibitor
and releasing medication. This means it increases the level of a brain chemical
called seratonin. It causes a reduction in appitite and a slowing of stomach
emptying. Studies have shown that redux along with a reduced-calorie diet
produces a significant reduction in weight over 4 to 6 months. Patients are
able to maintain their weight loss by continuing to take the medication.
<P>Patients with pulmonary hypertension should not take the medication. It
should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma or who are elderly.
It is not recommended to be used during pregnancy. It should also be used
cautiously with antidepressants or migraine medication. Possible side effects
are headaches, drowsiness, diarrhea, vomiting, depression, vertigo, chills,
thirst, and frequent urination.
