<H1>$4 Million Aerial Pollution Study of Delta Starts</H1>

<H3>9 January 1995</H3>

<P>
A project to study Pearl River delta pollution from the sky has got underway at the science university - even though a key United States satellite has not yet been launched
</P>

<P>
Under the $4.39 million project, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has set up one of Asia's first monitoring stations to receive colour satellite pictures indicating pollution levels throughout the South China Sea.
</P>

<P>
The body of water was causing international interest because of its rich natural resources and unusual currents caused by being a large body of water that mingled little with other oceans because it was nearly surrounded by land, said project organiser Dr. Fang Ming.
</P>

<P>
The sea-viewing, wide field of view satellite will beam data through a dish on the Sai Kung university's roof to produce the pictures on a university computer [using TeraScan].
</P>

<P>
The HKUST station is one of 12 worldwide allowed to use the pictures free.
</P>

<P>
NASA says it will launch the satellite in May.
</P>

<P>
However, Dr. Fang said the launch had been put off several times.
</P>

<P>
"It's a US$100 million [HK$773 million] project, which is small in NASA's eyes so not top priority." he said.  And the method by which they would launch the satellite - firing it with a rocket from a flying 747 - had failed in September, so remedial work was being done before another one could be sent up, he said.
</P>

<P>
The low-orbit, pole-to-pole satellite will send back colour images showing how much algae and plankton are living in the top layer of the ocean.  The concentration of these organisms directly corresponds to the amount of pollution, on which they feed.
</P>

<P>
The university is now receiving data from four National Oceanic Atmospheric Association weather satellites that show the wate temperature and wind direction.  Warmer water would also encourage algal growth so the two would be correlated, said Dr. Fang.
</P>

<P>
And last week the university recorded its first shot of the sediment - mostly sand - pouring out of the Pearl River into the ocean.
</P>

<P>
"We don't want [the launch] to be delayed too much because it will put us off our schedule but for the moment we have a lot to do," said Dr. Fang.
