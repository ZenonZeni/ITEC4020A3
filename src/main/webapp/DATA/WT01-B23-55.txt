<h1>CHAPTER VI. PRISON AND PAROLE COSTS </h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>INFLUENCE OF THE MOSCONE ACT ON PRISON POPULATIONS</h2>

<p>It is difficult to distinguish the roles of PC Section 17 and
the &quot;Wobbler,&quot; PC 1000 (drug diversion), the Moscone
Act, and the Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976 in reducing
prison populations for all had some effect. Nevertheless it is
possible to follow their cumulative impact chronologically. It
should be remembered that by definition, a -felony is a crime for
which a possible sentence is a year or more in prison. Most if
not all felony offenders reach prison via the Superior Court
pipeline. </p>

<p>Section 17 PC allowed certain felonies, including many
Marijuana possession cases, to be disposed of in lower courts.
This began the process of clearing the congestion in Superior
Court, but increased the workload in the lower courts. PC 1000,
the 1973 drug diversion program, also took first offenders out of
the courts, jails and prisons by allowing their charges to be
dismissed upon completion of a drug treatment program. </p>

<p>As a result the number of felony offenders disposed of in
Superior Court began diminishing, with the direct effect of
reducing the number of felony marijuana offenders in prison from
668 in 1973, to 605 in 1974 and 317 in 1975 (Source 1). </p>

<p>The Moscone Act, effective January 1, 1976, augmented this
process by taking the most common marijuana offense-- possession
of a small amount out of Superior Court entirely. Moreover, this
did not increase the lower court workload. As explained in a
previous chapter, the new law provided that individuals
apprehended for possession of less than an ounce need not be
formally arrested or booked on the misdemeanor charge. This
provision meant that marijuana possession offenders did not have
to appear even in lower courts. And since the maximum penalty for
this offense was a $100 fine (not incarceration), jail as well as
prison populations fell. </p>

<p>As a result, felony marijuana offenders in prison again fell
to only 198 in 1976. Thus!. before the Determinate Sentencing
Act, the combined three laws had reduced marijuana felon
populations by 70 percent between 1973 and 1976, simply by
emptying the Superior Court pipeline of felony marijuana
possession cases. </p>

<p>The Determinate Sentencing Act occasioned a one-time,
across-the-board release of felons from prison (Source 1). This
is reflected in the drop in marijuana felons from 198 in 1976 to
146 in 1977. The law's long-term effect was to decrease the
number of trials in Superior Court and to increase the number Of
guilty pleas (Source 2). </p>

<p>Acting in tandem, these legislative changes continued to
reduce the marijuana felon population to 121 in 1978, 101 in
1979, and 98 in 1980. Starting with 668 marijuana felons in 1973,
this represents an enormous 85 percent drop in the number of
marijuana prisoners. </p>

<p>Then in 1981, as felony arrests for sale and cultivation of
marijuana climbed and leveled off at about 21,000 a year, the
number of marijuana felons in prison again began to rise,
reaching 327 by 1984. Overall, the result of the Moscone Act and
these other influences was to reduce the marijuana prison
population to about half its 1972 level. </p>

<h2>FELONY MARIJUANA OFFENDER PRISON AND PAROLE COSTS</h2>

<p>The California Department of Corrections keeps close track of
the per capita costs of convicted felons in prison or on parole.
Since it costs no more for a marijuana offender than for any
other inmate or parolee, it is easy to determine the costs of
adult felony marijuana offenders by Multiplying the number of
such of-fenders in prison or on parole by the per capita costs
each year. All statistics for this calculation were provided by
the Department of Corrections (Source 1). </p>

<p>82/83 (82) 157 $12,706 $1,994,842 (82) 76 $ 837 $63,612 </p>

<p>83/84 (83) 191 $12,948 $2,473,068 (83) 167 $1,393 $232,631 </p>

<p>84/85 (84) 327 $14,344* $4,690,488 (84) 234 $1,847 $432,198 </p>

<p>NOTES: *1984/85 Institution and Parole per capita costs are
estimated. The Population counts are as of December 31 each year.
Felons counted are those with marijuana as their most serious
offense. </p>

<p>In 1973, the 668 marijuana offenders in prison were about 3
percent </p>

<p>of the total prison population of 22,486. In 1980 the 98
Marijuana felons were less than half of one percent (0.4
per-cent) of the prison population, and by 1984 the 327 marijuana
felons were 0.76 percent of that population. </p>

<p>By reducing the number of marijuana felons significantly
compared to their 1972-74 levels, the Moscone Act and the other
laws mentioned above saved the taxpayers consider-able sums of
money. Nevertheless it should be noticed that the cost of keeping
327 marijuana offenders in prison in 1984 was nearly 5 million
dollars. </p>

<h2>SOURCES</h2>

<p>1. Total and Marijuana Felon prison populations for 1972-84,
and Per Capita Institution and Parole Costs for fiscal 1977/78 to
1985/86 were provided by Phyllis Marquez and Linda Greutle,
Estimates Unit, California Department of Corrections
(Sacramento)., in January 1986. Ms. Greule alerted us to the
possible influence of the Determinate Sentencing Act in addition
to the Moscone Act in reducing prison populations, as well. </p>

<p>2. Judicial Council of California, 1985 Annual Report to the
Governor and the Legislature (San Francisco, 1986), p. 21. The
Judicial Council reports since 1977 have followed the influence
of the Determinate Sentencing Act closely. </p>

<p>MRA NOTE: in the later version of this report, look in the
Prison.CDC file folder for a study Linda Greule sent on the
aver-age time served before parole by marijuana prisoners. </p>

<p>Also: do a comparative cost estimate like the one in my
PRISON.CDC -file. </p>

<p>Also; check sources Suggested by Linda Greule for per capita
costs before 1977-- take it back to at least 1972. PRISON.CDC
-file again. </p>
