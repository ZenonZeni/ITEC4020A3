II.  THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH IS A BONA FIDE RELIGION 
     AND MARIJUANA IS CENTRAL TO ITS WORSHIP 

     The EZCC, which traces its origins back 6,000 years, is 

headquartered in Jamaica. [footnote 40]  By the end of the Sixties, the 

Church had received a number of visitors from the U.S. and began allowing 

Caucasians to join the Church. [fotnote 41]  As a result, priests and 

members of the Church began to travel back and forth between the U.S. and 

Jamaica, and a number of U.S. citizens became members and priests in the 

Church. [footnote 42]  The Church was incorporated in 1976 and purchased 

a 1,000 acre farm in White Horse, St Thomas parish, Jamaica. [footnote 

43]  In addition, the Church purchased a residence for its members at 

Star Island in Miami, Florida. [footnote 44] 

     Church members consider themselves the historical and spiritual 

descendants of the Israelites of the Old Testament. [footnote 45]

Because of the constraints of slavery, however, the Church's written 

history did not evolve and does not compare with the organizational 

identity enjoyed by some Caucasian religions. [footnote 46]  Nonetheless, 

the Church is understood to be a Christian religion with Jesus as its 

primary prophet. [footnote 47]  The Church reveres the Bible as its holy 

book, and members adhere to traditions set forth in the Old Testament 

regarding diet, dress, grooming, sexual conduct, and so forth. [footnote

     &quot;The Church historically has been extremely restrictive in its 

membership practices, limiting membership to those men and women who 

demonstrate an acceptance and adherence to the Church's tenets over a 

significant period of time.&quot; [footnote 49]  If members fail to follow the 

Church's rules of conduct, they are subject to harsh

sanctions and sometimes expulsion. [footnote 50] 

     The EZCC traces its use of marijuana [footnote 51] to the Bible, 

citing passages regarding herbs, smoke, and clouds, [footnote 52] and 

stating that 

     &quot;marijuana is the [e)ucharistic spiritual body and 
     blood of Christ,&quot; and &quot;[o]nly through the sacramental 
     use of marijuana--combined with prayer and spiritual 
     reasoning among the brethren--can members of the Church 
     come to know God within themselves and within 
     others.&quot; [footnote 53] 

The non-drug use of marijuana is allowed at any point during the day, but 

is most commonly ingested during the three daily prayer

     [footnote 51]  The EZCC's longstanding religious tradition of 
marijuana ingestion may have a history that dates back further than the 
Native American use of peyote.  Some authors postulate that many Indian 
religions did not incorporate the peyote ritual into their religious 
practices until the 1920s and 30s.  See A. Marriott, supra note 9, at 78-
79; see also Amicus Memorandum Before DEA, July 1988, at 34 (citing W. La 
Barre, The Peyote Cult 110-23 (4th ed. 1975)). 

     [footnote 52]  Id. at 14.  The EZCC has compiled works of 
scholarship and ancient references which substantiate and detail the 
religious use of marijuana from time immemorial.  See Amicus Memorandum 
Before DEA, July 1988, App. 6.  For instance, The Book of Grass 11-12 (G.  
Andrews &amp; S. Vinkenoog ed. 1967), is cited for a passage on ancient 
Scythia and Iran by Mircea Eliade: 
     only one document appears to indicate the existence of 
     a Getic shamanism: It is Strabols account of the 
     Mysian KAPNOBATAI, a name that has been translated, by 
     analogy with Aristophanes' AEROBATES, as 'those who 
     walk in clouds', but which should be translated as 
     'those who walk in smoke'.  Presumably the smoke is 
     hemp smoke, a rudimentary means of ecstasy known to 
     both the Thracians and the Scythians....&quot;

[footnote 55]  Church members state that their ingestion of marijuana 

during worship does not result in any side-effects [footnote 56] or 

intoxication, nor is that a desirable goal. 

     The Church not only does not encourage but in fact 
     absolutely forbids the recreational use of marijuana 
     for the purpose of achieving intoxification.  The 
     Church believes that such intentional misuse of 
     marijuana, by members or nonmembers, constitutes 
     sacrilegious behavior.  Church members are strictly 
     prohibited from using any intoxication or addictive 
     substance--legal or illegal-- for recreational

medical and psychiatric research studies done to determine the effects of 
marijuana on church members.  See Research Report by Brian L. Weiss,

     There has never been more than between 100 and 200 EZCC members in

dispersed due to numerous arrests and prosecutions. [footnote 59]  Some 

have left the Church, others have left the country, and others, like

III. THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH REPEATEDLY PETITIONS BUT IS 
     DENIED A SACRAMENTAL DRUG EXEMPTION SIMILAR TO THAT 
     ACCORDED TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH 

     A.  Olsen Proceeds Pro Se 

     From 1983 to 1985, Carl Eric Olsen, a member and priest of the EZCC, 

had repeated unilateral communications with the DEA attempting to procure 

for his Church a drug law exemption for the sacramental ingestion of 

marijuana. [footnote 61]  It was not until the

     SPECIAL EXEMPT CHURCH.  Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. 
     The listing of marijuana as a controlled substance in 
     Schedule I does not apply to the non-drug use of 
     marijuana in bona fide religious ceremonies of the 
     Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and members of the 
     Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church so using marijuana are 
     exempt from registration.  Any person who manufactures 
     marijuana for or distributes marijuana to the Ethiopian 
     Zion Coptic Church, however, is required to obtain

District of Columbia federal district court issued a show cause order to 

the DEA in response to Olsen's writ of mandamus filed in 1986, that the 

DEA finally responded. [footnote 62]  John C. Lawn, the DEA 

Administrator, answered Olsen's requests in the form of a three paragraph 

letter which stated in part: 

          In 1984, an estimated 7,800 to 9,200 metric tons 
     of marijuana were illegally consumed in the United 
     States.  It has been estimated that over 20 million 
     people in the United States use marijuana on a regular 
     basis.  Marijuana abuse is a major public health 
     problem in this country.  Accordingly, the 
     investigation and prosecution of marijuana traffickers, 
     the interdiction of marijuana smuggling and the 
     eradication of the drug at its source continue to be 
     major concerns of drug law enforcement both 
     domestically and internationally. 

          In view of the immensity of the marijuana abuse 
     problem in the United States and the magnitude of the 
     criminal activity surrounding the production and 
     trafficking in this substance, the Administrator of the 
     Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that the 
     interest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church in the 
     ceremonial use of marijuana is outweighed by the 
     compelling governmental interest in controlling the use 
     and illegal distribution of marijuana in the United 
     States. [footnote 63] 

     The district court dismissed Olsen's mandamus petition as moot; 

appealing the dismissal, Olsen stated, &quot;The DEA gave no reasons at all 

for denying the exemption, the DEA only gave 
_______________ 

     registration annually and to comply with all other 
     requirements of law. 
Id.  App. 13, 16, 18. 

     [footnote 62]  Id. App. 2-4.  Olsen also had filed a mandamus 
petition in the Eleventh Circuit.  Olsen v. DEA, 776 F.2d 267 (llth Cir. 
1985) (affirming district court's denial of olsen's request for a 
mandamus to compel DEA to respond to petitions for marijuana exemption 
because the statute authorizing exemptions does not provide for a 
religious exemption).

reasons for denying marijuana use to the general public. [footnote 64] 

Olsen also appealed the DEA's denial, admitting that the DEA had a 

compelling interest in the overall enforcement of the CSA, but arguing 

that the exemption granted to the NAC had not undermined that interest 

nor would a limited exemption for the EZCC. [footnote 65]  Olsen pointed 

out that the DEA previously denied a peyote exemption to the Church of 

the Awakening (&quot;CotA&quot;), after finding that the CotA was not similar to 

the NAC because &quot;peyote is essential and central to the [NAC] religion in 

that without peyote their religion would not and could not exist.&quot; 

[footnote 66]  The DEA made no such findings regarding the EZCC denial. 

[footnote 67] 

     In its response, the government set forth the three-part test from 

United States v. Lee, [footnote 68] for establishing a free exercise 

claim [footnote 69] and cited various free exercise cases. [footnote 70]

decision to the Ninth Circuit.  Kennedy v. BNDD, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir.

unconstitutional but nonetheless holding that extending the exemption to

denied), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115 (1973).

inquires: 1) whether the challenged law interferes with the free exercise

governmental interest. 455

Admittedly, the federal and state peyote exemptions tend to negate the 

existence of a compelling government interest in prohibiting its non-drug 

use in bona fide religious worship. [footnote 71]  Thus, the government 

tried to distinguish the NAC, stating that Congressional testimony 

presented by the director of the BNDD during the CSA hearings indicated 

that the NAC was considered 

     sui generis.  The history and tradition of the church 
     is such that there is no question but that they regard 
     peyote as a deity. [footnote 72] 

By contrast, the EZCC &quot;does not have such a Congressional recognition of 

its status.&quot; [footnote 73] 

     Olsen replied with a discussion of the key case regarding the 

sacramental use of marijuana, Leary v. United States. [footnote 74] 

Timothy Leary and his daughter were found in possession of marijuana upon 

their re-entry into this country by car from Mexico. [footnote 75]
