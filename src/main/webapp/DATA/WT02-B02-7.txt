<p><b>IV. PASSAGE OF THE UNIFORM NARCOTIC DRUG ACT: </b></p>

<p><b>1927-1937</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Our conclusions to this point bear summarization. During the
first two decades of the twentieth century, state as well as
national policy was steadfastly opposed to manufacture, sale and
consumption of narcotics and alcohol except for medical purposes.
Constitutional objections ions were uniformly ignored, in the
narcotics cases primarily because the nexus between the private
conduct and public harm was in fact a close one, and in the
alcohol cases primarily because the legislation was in response
to full operation of the public opinion process, to which the
courts were willing to defer. </p>

<p>We have also found that public opinion had not crystallized
against intoxicants generally, although public policy was moving
rapidly in that direction. Ultimately, the mere existence of that
public policy even in the form of criminal law-was not sufficient
to convert a public antipathy toward the evils of commercial
alcohol traffic into opposition to moderate use of alcohol. On
the question of private use, the public policy was unenforceable
and eventually abandoned. However, with respect to narcotics, the
public policy, also expressed through the criminal law,
effectively converted narcotics use, in the public view, from a
medical problem to a legal-moral problem. Sympathy for
unfortunate victims turned into moral indictment. Because other
laws and medical advances had reduced the number of accidental
addicts, the number of addicts decreased; in this sense the
public policy was successful. However, to the extent that this
police, effectively ostracized a group of users from the rest of
society, drove them to criminal activity to sustain their habit,
and engendered a moralistic public image, the stage was set for
many ensuing problems the consequences of which have only
recently become matters of public debate. </p>

<p>Ancillary to these developments during this period was the
classification of marijuana in some half the states as an
addictive drug that produced the same evils as the opiates and
cocaine--crime, pauperism and insanity. The users, few in number,
were primarily Mexicans. But as Mexican immigration increased and
the legitimate supply of narcotics and alcohol disappeared, a
fear developed, particularly in the western states, that
marijuana use would increase, particularly among the white youth.
As a result, some twenty-two states restricted marijuana use to
medical channels. The private conduct objection having
evaporated, the courts uncritically affirmed the legislative
classification, accepting on faith nonscientific opinion that
marijuana was a &quot;killer weed.&quot; </p>

<p>Even though the public opinion process did not operate on the
issue during this period, the decision-makers in all probability
thought that their actions comported with latent public
attitudes. If indeed marijuana caused crime and insanity, of
course the public would oppose its use, as it presumably did use
of opium and cocaine. Because the users were few in number and
confined primarily to a suppressed social and economic minority,
there was no voice which could be beard to challenge these
assumptions. To put it another way, the middle class had
successfully frustrated alcohol prohibition because the public
opinion process came to reflect its view that the law should not
condemn intoxication. Yet because marijuana use was primarily a
lower class phenomenon, the middle class was generally unaware of
the proposed legislation. </p>

<p>The public opinion process did not operate and decision-makers
remained uninformed about the drug. Quickly and with neither
consideration nor dissent, the laws were enacted, thus
establishing a deliberative format followed often in the
succeeding debates. </p>

<p>Although the groundwork had been laid, denigration of the
&quot;loco-weed&quot; was primarily a regional phenomenon until
1932. Nationalization ensued in two fell swoops in the 1930's.
First, cannabis was included in an optional provision of the
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act proposed in 1932. Second, Congress
enacted the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937. In the following sections
we shall scrutinize these two watershed developments. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. Origins of the Uniform Law</b> </p>

<p>As we have suggested, the Harrison Act's masquerade as a
revenue measure required residual state legislation in order to
effectuate full prohibition of the narcotics trade in America.1
After its passage most states obediently marched to the tune
played in Washington. By 1931 every state had restricted the sale
of cocaine and, with the exception of two, the opiates.2
Thirty-six states had enacted legislation prohibiting
unauthorized possession of cocaine3 and thirty-five prohibited
unauthorized possession of the opiates and other restricted
drugs.4 Eight states also prohibited possession of hypodermic
syringes.5 Perhaps the most significant feature of the state
response to the Harrison Act was the sharp increase in penalties
between 1914 and 1931.6 Even those penalties, however, seem light
in comparison with the current penalties.7 </p>

<p>On the other hand, some influential legislators thought that
the Federal Act was sufficient to deal with the problem.8 And
there was a considerable lack of uniformity regarding the
offenses prohibited and the penalties imposed by the several
states. Finally, there was little attention devoted to
development of enforcement patterns within and among the states.9
</p>

<p>With such a variety of state legislation, it is not surprising
that little data is available on the enforcement of these laws.
Since the Uniform Crime Statistics, currently the most reliable
source for enforcement data, were first compiled in 1932, there
are no figures on the number of drug arrests by state authorities
in the 1920's. One commentator asserts: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As of June 30, 1928, of the 7738 prisoners in federal
    penitentiaries, 2529 were sentenced for narcotics offenses,
    1156 for prohibition law violations, and 1148 for
    stolen-vehicle transactions. Data are not available for
    approximately the same number in state institutions at this
    time.10 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the significant degree of federal enforcement activity
evidenced by the above data, state law enforcement agencies
seldom involved themselves with narcotics.11 Perhaps the best
evidence of the lax enforcement of state narcotic laws from 1914
to 1927 is the 1921 call for more effective enforcement of the
1917 Massachusetts anti-narcotic law by the Medical Director of
the Boston Municipal Court: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our laws aiming at the suppression of morphinism could
    perhaps be better, but, no matter whether they be improved or
    not, they will not have their maximal efficiency without
    adequate appropriations for their enforcement. Even with the
    insufficient funds now available, more could be reached. I
    understand, for instance, that there is no special police
    force (white squads) entrusted with the detection and arrest
    of cases of V.D.L. [Violation of the Drug Law.] and that
    officers are very much hankered by not being allowed to
    follow suspected persons outside their particular
    districts.12 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general lack of uniformity in anti-narcotic legislation,13
the weakness of state enforcement procedures, 14 and the growing
hysteria about dope fiends and criminality15 converged in several
requests beginning as early as 1927 for a uniform state narcotic
law.16 </p>

<p>The drafting process of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act must
also be viewed against the backdrop of two larger movements: </p>

<p>(1) the trend toward the creation and dissemination of uniform
state laws by the National Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, a
group to which each state sent two representatives appointed by
the governor; and </p>

<p>(2) the general concern in the late 20's and early 30's about
controlling interstate crime, manifested, for example, in the
creation of the nearly autonomous Federal Bureau of Investigation
in 1930. </p>

<p>Because the concepts of states rights and narrowly construed
federal power held shelf sway in this period, appeal to the
National Commissioners was the inevitable recourse for those
pressing for uniform and-narcotic regulations. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. Drafting the Law</b> </p>

<p>A committee of Commissioners in conjunction with Dr. William
C. Woodward, Executive Secretary of the Bureau of Legal Medicine
and Legislation of the American Medical Association, prepared and
submitted at the 1925 meeting of the Commissioners the First
Tentative Draft.17 The Committee report stated: &quot;It occurs
to your committee that the New York Act should be taken as a
basis for framing a Uniform Act, and the draft submitted herewith
is largely a copy of the New York Act.&quot; 18 It appears that
the First Draft was drawn up by the Chairman of the Committee
alone.19 It was never presented on the floor of the full meeting
but was recommitted for further study. 20 The First Draft
included the following definitions: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(12) &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; or &quot;cannabis
    sativa&quot; shall include any compound, manufacture, salt,
    derivative or preparation thereof and any synthetic
    substitute for any of them identical in chemical composition.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>(13) &quot;Habit forming drugs&quot; shall mean coca
    leaves, opium, cannabis indica or cannabis sativa.21 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere in the Committee report or in the Proceedings does
there appear an explanation of the inclusion of cannabis under
the prohibited or regulated drugs. </p>

<p>The Second Tentative Draft was presented in 1928,22 and again
the draft was not discussed at the Conference but recommitted for
further study.23 The Second Draft was an exact copy of the 1927
New York statute.24 It retained cannabis in the class of
&quot;habit forming drugs .&quot; 25 The lack of concern on the
part of the Commissioners themselves for the whole narcotics
matter is reflected in the remarks of the President of the
Conference in introducing a brief statement to the Conference by
Dr. Woodward: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>President Miller: In view of the importance of the act I
    think it would not be amiss to listen to the Doctor for a few
    minutes, that he may point out to us why it is important. In
    some of the states we do not recognize the importance because
    it has not been called to our attention.26 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the statements of Dr. Woodward point out that one of
the major forces supporting the drafting of the Uniform Act was
the AMA. The doctors not only wanted to protect the public from
drug addiction but also sought uniformity among state laws
&quot;in order that the profession may have a better
understanding of its obligations and duties and of its rights in
the use of narcotic drugs. &quot; 27 </p>

<p>Two Third Drafts were submitted. The initial one closely
resembled the first two Tentative Drafts and was presented in
1929.28 Again, it was recommitted for further study.29 The second
Third Tentative Draft30 was the first to remove cannabis from the
definition of &quot;habit forming drugs&quot; and to include only
a supplemental provision for dealing with the drug.31 The
explanation for this change from the first two drafts is
contained in this note following the supplemental section: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note: Because of the many objections raised to the
    inclusion of cannabis indica, cannabis americana and cannabis
    sativa in the general list of habit-forming drugs, no mention
    is made of them in other sections of this act. The foregoing
    section is presented in order to meet an apparent demand for
    some method of preventing the use of such drugs for the
    production and maintenance of undesirable drug addiction. It
    may be adopted or rejected, as each state sees fit, without
    affecting the rest of the act.32 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judge Deering, the Chairman of the Committee on the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act, recommended recommission for further study
because the committee had not yet had a chance to consult with
the newly created Bureau of Narcotics. At the time of this
conference (August 14, 1930) no one had yet been appointed to
fill the office of Commissioner of the Bureau.33 </p>

<p>After receiving suggestions from the newly appointed
Commissioner Anslinger, the Committee presented a Fourth
Tentative Draft to the national conference in September 1931.34
The section dealing with marijuana was identical to that included
in the 1930 revised version of the Third Tentative Draft.35 The
national conference directed the Committee to return the next
year with a Fifth Tentative or Final Draft:36 </p>

<p>The Fifth-and final-Tentative Draft was adopted by the
National Conference of Commissioners on October 8, 1932.37 There
were some major changes in the Uniform Act between the Fourth and
the Fifth Tentative Drafts with regard to the regulation of
marijuana. Although the marijuana provisions remained
supplemental to the main body of the Act, any state wishing to
regulate sale and possession of marijuana was instructed to
simply add cannabis to the definition of &quot;narcotic
drugs,&quot; in which case all the other provisions of the Act
would apply to marijuana as well as the opiates and cocaine.38 It
appears that the change from a supplemental section to a series
of amendments to the relevant sections of the Act was preferred
by the Narcotics Bureau.39 The only opposition to adoption of the
Final Draft came from some Commissioners who objected to tying
the uniform state law to the terms of the Federal Harrison Act.40
This last obstacle to adoption of the Act was overcome by the
argument that a number of states had already passed such
legislation so that the federalism problem should not stand in
the way; the Act was adopted 26-3.41 These floor arguments at the
national conference are a most important indication that no one
challenged or even brought up the issue of the designations of
the drugs to be prohibited. Moreover, this brief debate confirms
the notion that the Act received very little attention of any of
the Commissioners other than those sitting on the committee that
drafted it.42 </p>

<p>Examination of the annual proceedings of the Commissioners
immediately suggests several conclusions about the drafting and
proposal of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. (1) It was drafted in
conjunction with the American Medical Association and, after
1930, Commissioner Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
(2) It was not one of the more controversial uniform laws and it
was given little consideration during the full meetings of the
Commissioners. (3) Impetus for the legislation, especially the
optional marijuana provisions, came from the Bureau of Narcotics
itself. (4) No scientific study of any kind was undertaken before
the optional marijuana section was proposed. (5)The first three
tentative drafts included marijuana within the general part of
the Act while the last two (including the one finally adopted by
the Commissioners) made marijuana the subject of a separate,
optional provision. (6) The model for all the drafts of the
Uniform Act was the 1927 New York State statute. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>C. Passage of the State Laws</b> </p>

<p>By 1937 every state had enacted some form of legislation
relating to marijuana, and thirty-five had enacted the Uniform
Act.43 The process by which a previously regional phenomenon
became nationwide closely parallels that which characterized the
earlier state-by-state developments. The major difference is that
the Bureau of Narcotics sought to insure passage of the Act in
each state through lobbying and testifying before the
legislatures and by propagandizing in channels of public opinion.
The Bureau's role has been overstated, however. The same factors
that combined to produce the earlier legislation were exacerbated
during the nationalization period, 1932-1937, and the legislation
probably would have passed just as easily without the efforts of
the Bureau. </p>

<p>Use of the drug was still slight and confined to
underprivileged or fringe groups who had no access either to
public opinion or to the legislators. The middle class had little
knowledge and even less interest in the drug and the legislation.
Passage of the Act in each state was attended by little
publicity, no scientific study and even more blatant ethnic
aspersions than the earlier laws. In short, the laws went
unnoticed by legal commentators, the press and the public at
large, despite the propagandizing efforts of the Bureau of
Narcotics. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. Use Patterns and Public Knowledge: 1931-1937</b> </p>

<p>As we noted earlier, marijuana use began in this country in
states near the Mexican border,44 &quot;marijuana&quot; in fact
being a Mexican label for the cannabis drug. Throughout the
1920's marijuana use was confined primarily to the
Mexican-American community; however, by the late 20's use of this
drug had spread to many of the larger cities and had become quite
popular among some elements in the Black ghettoes .45 jazz
musicians, dancers and others found the drug a cheap and readily
available euphoriant.46 </p>

<p>Nevertheless, use still remained slight even in 1934.
Commissioner Anslinger himself asserted in 1937: &quot;Ten years
ago we only heard about it [marijuana] throughout the Southwest .
. . . [I]t has only become a national menace in the last 3
years.&quot; 47 Still another commentator has written: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Only in the 1920's was there any significant usage even by
    the Mexican-American communities in border cities, and only
    in the mid and late 1920's did Negro, jazz musicians and
    &quot;degenerate&quot; bohemian sub-cultures start smoking
    marijuana. Even the most lurid Journalists did not claim
    marijuana &quot;seeped&quot; into society at large until the
    1930's and usually the mid-30's.48 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As late as 1928, the arrest of one Harlem youth for possession
of a small amount of marijuana was news.&quot; Thus, we conclude
that the number of users was still small, although it may have
begun to grow around 1935, and that these users were still
concentrated regionally in the West and Southwest and
socioeconomically within the lower class Mexican-American and
Black communities. </p>

<p>At the same time, the overwhelming majority of middle-class
Americans in the 1930's knew nothing of marijuana use-they had
never seen marijuana and knew no one who used the drug. Prior to
1935 there was little, if any, attention given marijuana in major
national magazines50 and the leading national newspapers.51 That
few middle class Americans in this period knew anything of
marijuana or its effects is best illustrated by the fact that the
Bureau of Narcotics conducted a campaign to alert people to the
dangers of marijuana. The Bureau as early as 1932 began arousing
public opinion against marijuana by &quot;an educational campaign
describing the drug, its identification and its evil
effects.&quot; 52 In July 1936, the New York City police were
shown marijuana so that they would recognize it growing or in
dried, smokeable form .53 Thus, even policemen had to be shown
the plant as late as 1936 to permit effective enforcement of the
New York state law. We may accordingly infer that the level of
public familiarity with the drug was quite low indeed.54 </p>

<p>What little information filtered to the middle class was
generated by sporadic campaigns by local newspapers detailing the
potential evils of marijuana; the accounts, as before, were
sensationalistic and tended to exacerbate latent ethnic
prejudices. For example, a 1934 newspaper account linked crime in
the Southwest with marijuana smoking Mexican-Americans in the
region.55 In a 1935 letter to the editor of the New York Times, a
Sacramento, California, reader asserted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana, perhaps now the most iinsidious of our
    narcotics, is a direct by-product of unrestricted Mexican
    immigration . . . . Mexican peddlers have been caught
    distributing sample marijuana cigarettes to school
    children.56 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writer went on to demand a quota on Mexicans permitted to
enter the country. In testifying in favor of the Marihuana Tax
Act, Commissioner Anslinger submitted a letter he had received
from the editor of a Colorado newspaper asking the Bureau to help
stamp out the marijuana menace. After describing an attack by a
Mexican-American, allegedly under the influence of marijuana, on
a girl of his region the writer stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I wish I could show you what a small marijuana cigaret can
    do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents.
    That's why our problem is so great; the greatest percentage
    of our population is composed of Spanish-speaking persons,
    most of whom are low mentally, because of social and racial
    conditions.57 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, in the testimony at the hearings on the Marihuana Tax
Act the following is excerpted from an article included in the
record: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We find then that Colorado reports that the Mexican
    population there cultivates on an average of 2 to 3 tons of
    the weed annually. This the Mexicans make Into cigarettes,
    which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white school
    students.58 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, not only did few middle-class Americans know about
marijuana and its use, but also what little
&quot;information&quot; was available provoked an automatic
adverse association of the drug with Mexican immigration, crime
and the deviant life style in the Black ghettos. Naturally, the
impending drug legislation, as had the earlier state legislation,
became entangled with society's views of these minority groups. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Role of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</b> </p>

<p>It has become quite fashionable among critics of existing
marijuana legislation to assert that the sole cause of the
illegal status of marijuana has been the crusading zeal of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and especially of its long-time head,
Harry J. Anslinger. Some observers have suggested that the
Bureau's activity was produced by bureaucratic exigencies and the
need to expand;59 others have said the Bureau was on a moral
crusade;60 still others have asserted that the Bureau believed
its own propaganda about the link between criminality and dope
fiends.61 While much of this may be true, it is clear that the
Bureau did not single-handedly conjure up the idea of banning
marijuana use. Since many states had already undertaken the
regulation of marijuana before the creation of the Bureau in
1930, we cannot credit the Bureau alone with the pressure to
outlaw the drug. </p>

<p>At the same time, it is certain that the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics' actions quickened the pace of the passage by state
legislators of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. The Bureau saw the
passage of state narcotics laws as one of its primary objectives.
To this end we have detailed how directly the Bureau was involved
in the creation of the Final Draft of the Uniform Act. After
approval of the Final Draft, the Bureau began a significant
campaign in the newspapers and legal journals to boost public
support for the Uniform Act.62 By detailing the inability of
federal enforcement agencies to deal with the burgeoning
narcotics traffic, the Bureau continued to press for passage of
the Uniform Act by creating a felt need in the public for such
legislation.63 Despite the efforts of the Bureau, the Uniform Act
went virtually unnoticed by legal commentators and periodicals,
and by the public media. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Legislative Scrutiny and Media Coverage</b> </p>

<p>The Uniform Act was passed by the legislatures of most states
with out scientific study or debate and without attracting public
attention. </p>

<p>In examining in detail the passage of the Uniform Act in
Virginia and some other selected states, it will be clear that
public concern over marijuana succeeded the outlawing of the drug
and did not precede it. Our methodology to determine the extent
of public attention in a given state at the time of the passage
of the act was to review the newspapers of larger cities for the
two weeks before and after passage.64 </p>

<p>In Virginia the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act passed the House
88-0 on February 16, 1934,65 and was approved 34-0 by the Senate
on February 22.66 Although the Act as passed in Virginia
contained no marijuana provisions, the same legislature the next
month passed a bill (H.B. 236), prohibiting &quot;use of opium,
marijuana [and] loco weed ... in the manufacture of cigarettes,
cigars&quot; and other tobacco products.67 This law, which
amended a 1910 Virginia statute prohibiting the use of opium in
the manufacture of cigarettes,68 was the first mention of
marijuana, or any of its derivatives in the Virginia Code. </p>

<p>An examination of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the newspaper
of the state capital and perhaps the most influential newspaper
in the state at that time, for the period surrounding the
enactment of these two provisions (February 1 to March 15, 1934)
shows clearly that little, if any, public attention attended
their passage. There is no mention at any time of H.B. 236.69 As
for H.B. 94 (the Uniform Act), the Times Dispatch reported on
February 7 that the bill had been introduced. This announcement
was buried among the list of all bills introduced and referred on
February 6.70 In a February 12 article dealing with
&quot;controversial&quot; bills before the House and Senate that
week no mention was made of H.B. 94. On March 6, the newspaper
recorded: &quot;Among the important bills passed were. . . . [far
down the list] the Scott bill, making the State narcotic law
conform to the Federal statute.&quot; 71 That is the sum of the
publicity received by the Uniform Act and the statute that first
regulated marijuana in any way in Virginia. </p>

<p>In 1936, the legislature passed a separate statute prohibiting
the sale and use of marijuana. This bill-S.B. 289-passed the
House and Senate unanimously.72 The Act prohibited, except for a
narrow medical exception, sale, possession, use and cultivation
of marijuana .73 The penalties for violation, interestingly, were
more severe than those for violation of the 1934 Uniform Act.
Looking again at the Times-Dispatch for the period from February
15 to March 19, 1936, we find only one brief article on the new
marijuana legislation. After the Senate passed the measure on
February 29, the following appeared: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Among the bills passed by the Senate was the Apperson
    measure prohibiting the cultivation, sale or distribution of
    derivatives of the plant cannabis sativa, introduced as an
    outgrowth of alleged traffic in marihuana cigarettes in
    Roanoke. It fixes punishment for violation of its provisions
    at from one to 10 years in the penitentiary, or by
    confinement in jail for 12 months and a fine of not more than
    $1,000 or both. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Charges that school children were being induced to become
    addicts of marihuana cigarettes and that the weed was being
    cultivated in and near the city on a wide scale were laid
    before the Roanoke City Council last year. A youth who said
    he was a former addict of the drug testified before the
    Council that inhalation of one of the cigarettes would
    produce a 'cheap drunk' of several days' duration.74 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No further mention of this statute was made after the House
passed it or after the Governor signed it into law. </p>

<p>In order to determine whether the lack of public attention in
Virginia was common to other states when the first prohibition of
marijuana took place, we have surveyed the leading newspapers of
several other states at the times encompassing passage of the
law. We tried to select states that had not previously regulated
use of the drug under the assumption that more publicity would
attend initial legislation than an amendment of existing law. </p>

<p>In New Jersey, Rhode Island, Oregon and West Virginia, for
example, the major newspapers of Newark, Providence, Salem and
Charleston 78 respectively, referred to the Uniform Act only once
and to marijuana not at all. In Kentucky, the Louisville Herald
Post printed only two short references to the Uniform Act,79 one
of which referred to marijuana: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[Congressman] Kramer added that boys and girls of school
    age are being led into the use of habit forming drugs by
    underworld leaders.......... Muggles&quot; or cigarettes made
    from marijuana, commonly called loco weed or hemp, are also
    tabooed under the new state law, it was learned.80 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typical of both legislative and newspaper concern about the
new law is the following Charleston Daily Mail comment: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A Narcotic Bill </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inconspicuously upon the special calendar of the house of
    delegates rather far down upon it-is Engrossed S.B. No. 230,
    lodging specific powers in the hands of state authorities for
    the control of the traffic in narcotics. It has passed the
    Senate unanimously. It should pass the House, and its only
    danger of defeat there is the very real one that it will
    become lost in the shuffle of adjournment now but a few hours
    away. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The bill goes under the name of the uniform narcotic drug
    act and it is just that. Identical measures for the control
    by the states of illicit traffic on drugs have been passed by
    other states, notably the Southern group. Its passage here
    would result in a broad territory in which there are
    corresponding laws .... 81 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editorial nowhere mentions marijuana. The bill itself
passed in the waning hours of the special session with no
subsequent attention given it. 82 </p>

<p>From our survey of these and other states, we have concluded
that with but one exception83 the Virginia experience was the
norm. (1) The laws prohibiting use, sale, possession, and
distribution of marijuana passed unnoticed by the media. There
was no public outcry for such legislation. (2) Quite often the
bill was buried beneath more controversial bills in a busy
legislative session. (3) In many states the Act was passed late
in the session along with myriad other
&quot;uncontroversial&quot; laws. (4) Finally, no state undertook
independent study to determine the medical facts about
marijuana-they relied on information supplied by the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics84 or a few lurid newspaper stories.85 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Available Medical Opinion</b> </p>

<p>In conjunction with the fourth conclusion from our state case
histories of the passage of this Act, we should examine the
extent of medical knowledge that might have been available to
legislators had they wanted to conduct an independent evaluation
of the dangers of the hemp drugs. </p>

<p>There were five influential sources for information about the
effects of marijuana and hemp on humans. None of these were
conducted with the scientific precision characterizing modern
studies of drug effects. However, they each deserve mention here
either because they deserved attention then or because they
heavily influenced later commentators. </p>

<p>The first exhaustive study of the effects of cannabis and the
other hemp drugs was done by the British in India. Their Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission studied cannabis use among the native
population in India in 1893 and 1894,86 and submitted its
conclusions in a 500-page report. The Commission received
evidence from 1,193 witnesses, including 335 doctors, and studied
the relevant drug-related judicial proceedings and the intake
records of every mental hospital in British India. As a result
they concluded: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the
    Commission are of opinion that their moderate use produces no
    moral injury whatever. There is no adequate ground for
    believing that it injuriously affects the character of the
    consumer. Excessive consumption, on the other hand, both
    indicates and intensifies moral weakness or depravity.
    Manifest excess leads directly to loss of self-respect, and
    thus to moral degradation. In respect to his relations with
    society, however, even the excessive consumer of hemp drugs
    is ordinarily inoffensive. His excesses may indeed bring him
    to degraded poverty which may lead him to dishonest
    practices; and occasionally, but apparently very rarely
    indeed, excessive indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to
    violent crime. But for all practical purposes it may be laid
    down that there is little or no connection between the use of
    hemp drugs and crime.87 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is quite clear, however, that the Indian Hemp Drug
Commission88 Report was not disseminated in the United States
until 1969 . </p>

<p>On the other hand, periodic reports of the Panama Canal Zone
Governor's Committee to study the physical and moral effects of
the use of marijuana were available to legislators before the
passage of the Uniform Act. After an investigation extending from
April to December 1925, the Committee reached the following
conclusions: </p>

<p>There is no evidence that marijuana as grown here is a
&quot;habit-forming&quot; drug in the sense in which the term is
applied to alcohol, opium, cocaine etc. or that it has any
appreciable deleterious in influence on the individual using
it.89 </p>

<p>In 1933, a similar Panama Canal Zone committee reported: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Delinquencies due to marijuana smoking which result in
    trial by military court are negligible in number when
    compared with delinquencies resulting from the use of
    alcoholic drinks which also may be classed as stimulants and
    intoxicants.90 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>About the time that the final Governor's Committee Report from
the Canal Zone was completed, a New Orleans physician, Dr.
Fossier, completed a study from which he concluded that marijuana
was a highly dangerous drug with habit-forming properties.91 This
piece would have remained relatively unnoticed due to the
obscurity of the journal in which it was published had it not
been picked up by the New Orleans District Attorney, Eugene
Stanley, and made the basis for his own article-Marihuana as a
Developer of Criminals92 which appeared in a law enforcement
journal. Mr. Stanley stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is an ideal drug to cut off inhibitions quickly. . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>At the present time the underworld has been quick to
    realize the value of this drug in subjugating the will of
    human derelicts to that of a master mind. Its use sweeps away
    all restraint, and to its influence may be attributed many of
    our present day crimes. It has been the experience of the
    Police and Prosecuting Officials in the South that
    immediately before the commission of many crimes the use of
    marihuana cigarettes has been indulged in by criminals so as
    to relieve themselves from the natural restraint which might
    deter them from the commission of criminal acts, and to give
    them the false courage necessary to commit the contemplated
    crime.93 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Stanley's article, based on no empirical data whatsoever,
was widely used by courts to corroborate early legislation and by
lobbyists to justify the later prohibitive legislation against
the hemp drugs.94 </p>

<p>In 1933 the following colloquy appeared in the Journal of the
American Medical Association: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Effects of Cannabis </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To the Editor:-I have been hearing about the smoking of
    cigarets dipped into or medicated with fluid extract of
    Cannabis americana. I can find nothing about the use of the
    drug by addicts. What is its immediate effect? What are its
    late effects? What is the minimum lethal dose? In what way
    does it differ from or resemble &quot;muggles&quot; in its
    action? While in Louisiana I was told that the use of
    marihuana causes dementia. Is this true' Please omit name. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>M.D., Illinois. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>ANSWER.-The effect of Cannabis americana is the same as
    that of Cannabis indica- and, of the effect of the latter,
    the books are so full that it is hardly necessary to detail
    them here. It must suffice here to say that cannabis, at the
    height of its action, usually produces hallucinations, with
    or without euphoria, and that these are followed by a deep
    sleep. Its most marked after-effect is the liability to the
    establishment of a craving for the drug, the habitual use of
    which undermines the intellectual qualities and the social
    value of the victim and leads to general physical
    deterioration. It is stated that smokers nearly always become
    imbecile in time. The minimum lethal dose is unknown, no
    fatalities having been reported in man. In view of the fact
    that one dose may kill one dog that has no marked effect on
    another, one must admit the possibility of a lethal effect on
    man. In view of what has been said, it must be admitted that
    &quot;marihuana,&quot; which is merely another name for
    Cannabis indica, may cause dementia.95 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reply contains no indication how or where the persons who
answered the question got their data. It seems clear from the
nature of the response that the medical community was quite
uncertain as to the effects of the drug in 1933. </p>

<p>In 1934, Dr. Walter Bromberg, senior psychiatrist at Bellevue
Hospital, reported that marijuana was not a habit-forming drug
and was far less responsible for crime than other drugs such as
alcohol. In this study, Bromberg drew his data from examination
of 2,216 inmates convicted of felonies.96 Dr. Bromberg pointed
out that marijuana users tend to be passive in comparison to
users of alcohol and that the hemp drugs should lead to crime
only in cases of use by already psychopathic types. 97 </p>

<p>This then was the extent of medical evidence available to
laymen and legislators alike at the time the Uniform Narcotic
Drug Act and the fast prohibitions of marijuana were enacted in
most states. We can conclude the following from our brief review
of the medical literature. (1) Little was really known about the
effects of marijuana use-there were few studies and what studies
there were had serious methodological flaws. (2) Even if the
studies we record had been adequate methodologically, they
appeared generally in obscure medical not widely read by laymen.
(3) Of these studies, most found marijuana relatively harmless
especially in contrast to use of alcohol. (4) None of these
studies were considered in either the formulation or the passage
of the Uniform Act in the states examined. And what is more
astounding is that instead of consulting medical opinion,
legislators relied on lurid newspaper accounts of marijuana,
often provided by defendants in criminal prosecutions whose
motivation was to use marijuana to escape criminal
responsibility. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>5. Provisions of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and
Supplemental Virginia Marijuana Statute</b> </p>

<p>Having studied the circumstances surrounding passage of the
Uniform Act and similar legislation in several states between
1932 and 1937, we shall briefly summarize the provisions of those
laws. </p>

<p>(a) Classification and Offenses.-The Virginia legislature made
no changes in the Uniform Act as drafted by the Commissioners and
did not include the supplementary marijuana provisions in passing
that Act.98 In 1936, Virginia passed special marijuana
legislation99. which defined cannabis exactly as did the
definitional provision of the Uniform Act. Both the special
marijuana statute in Virginia and the Uniform Act prohibited
possession, transfer and cultivation of the drug100 but did not
refer to the more specific acts that later came to be separated
and punished more heavily, such as sale to a minor and possession
of more than a certain amount. </p>

<p>(b) Penalties.-The Uniform Act contained no specific penalties
for its violations; the matter of supplying the appropriate
penalties was left to each state. Virginia punished first
violations of its Uniform Act by a fine not exceeding $100 and/or
imprisonment in jail not exceeding one year, and second and
subsequent offenses by a fine not exceeding $1,000 and/or
imprisonment for not more than five years in the penitentiary.101
The penalties for violation of Virginia's 1936 marijuana statute
were stiffer than for violation of its Uniform Act. Each offense
was punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary for from one
to ten years or by confinement in jail for not more than twelve
months and/or by a fine up to $1,000, in the discretion of the
court or jury.102 </p>

<p>An analysis of penalties for violation of the marijuana
statutes enacted in other states at about the same time indicates
Virginia's penalties were atypically harsh. In New Jersey, for
instance, the penalty for unlawful possession and sale of
marijuana was that attaching to a high misdemeanor.103 In Rhode
Island the penalty for unlawful possession was a fine of not more
than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than threeyears or
both.104 For unlawful selling, Rhode Island provided a fine of
not more than $2,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years
or both.105 In Kentucky the penalty for a first offense violation
was a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 or jail
for not less than thirty days nor more than one year or both. For
second and subsequent offenses the statute required imprisonment
in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than five
years.106 Finally, West Virginia penalized a first offender by a
fine not exceeding $100 or jail for not exceeding one year or
both, and subsequent offenders by fine not exceeding $1,000 or
imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five years or
both.107 </p>

<p>This comparison indicates that Virginia penalties could be
more severe than the average. Moreover, Virginia did not
distinguish in penalty between possession and sale of the drug,
and violation of Virginia's separate marijuana law could be more
heavily penalized than violation of the Uniform Act. </p>

<p>48. REPORT OF THE NEW YORK STATE BAR ASSOCIATION 133 [1925]
(emphasis original) Commissioner Anslinger felt that the states
had failed to do their part during this period: </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the limited power of the Federal Government,
state officers immediately became imbued with the erroneous
impression that the problem of preventing abuse of narcotic drugs
was one now [after the Harrison Act] exclusively cognizable by
the National Government, and that the Federal Law alone,
enforced, of course, by Federal agencies only, should represent
all the control necessary over the illicit narcotic drug traffic.

only reference to the Act was Louisville Herald Post. June 6,
1934, at 10. </p>

<p>82 Id., Mar. 11, 1935, at 1, col. 1, reports: &quot;In the
confusion of the closing hours Saturday night the legislature
passed many bills, many of them unread and unprinted and not
understood.&quot; </p>

<p>83 In Missouri, the passage of the Uniform Act was attended by
pressure on the legislature stemming from a hysteria campaign in
the St. Louis Star Times which contained 5 major articles urging
the outlawing of marijuana and presenting lurid case studies of
the evils of the drug. These articles were quoted in the Tax Act
Hearings. See St. Louis Star Times, Jan. 17-Feb. 19, 1935. </p>

<p>84 See, e.g., N.Y. Times, Sept. 16, 1931, at 37, col. 2
(recording Commissioner Anslinger's statements on the need for
uniform state laws to regulate marijuana). </p>

<p>85 In the Missouri case, the legislature, in response to the
scare stories in the St. Louis Star Times, took only 10 days to
present the law, hold quick hearings, and unanimously pass the
anti-marijuana legislation. </p>

<p>97 Id. at 309; see Facts and Fancies About Marijuana, LITERARY
DIGEST, Oct. 24, 1936, at 7-8. This presentation begins by
digesting Dr. Bromberg's article for laymen: </p>

<p>It is clear from this study [of 2,216 criminals convicted of
felonies] that in this region the drug is a breeder of crime only
when used by psychopathic types in whom the drug allows the
emergence of aggressive, sexual or antisocial tendencies. . . .
It is quite probable that alcohol is more responsible as an agent
for crime than is marihuana. </p>

<p>The article continues: </p>

<p>The following facts stand out in social and medical reports: </p>

<p>1. Marihuana is not a habit-forming drug, as is heroin or
opium. </p>

<p>2. It prolongs sensations; it is in high favor as an
aphrodisiac. </p>

<p>3. It is the most inexpensive of drugs; marihuana cigarettes
usually selling at from three to twenty-five cents each. </p>

<p>The article then describes the effects of marijuana: </p>

<p>After smoking from one to three &quot;reefers,&quot; if one
has not been told what to expect, the first effects of the drug
pass almost unnoticed-nothing, perhaps, but a slight twitching of
muscles of the neck, back or legs. The mind remains calm and
clear. Suddenly, without apparent cause, a chance remark . . .
sends the subject into a spasm of violent laughter. </p>

<p>Becoming calm again, while the drug continues to exert its
weird effects, the smoker finds ideas crowding through his brain
with bewildering rapidity; those around him become slow-dull. Nor
is the language of his own tongue swift enough to keep pace with
his lightning thoughts. </p>

<p>Soon the self-esteem of the smoker begins to grow in like
proportion. . . . </p>

<p>Paradoxically, trifling discomforts become unbearable evils;
the flare of a match near-by brings a resentment that is
immediately transformed into an overwhelming desire for revenge.
But before the &quot;reefer man&quot; could possibly climb to his
feet, or even reach a hand for a gun or knife, new thoughts have
come crowding in.... </p>

<p>Above all other distinguishing effects of marihuana
intoxication is the fact that all normal conceptions of time and
space are lost. </p>

<p>As in the split-second dream that seems to last the night
through, time seems of interminable length; the clock stands
still for days. </p>

<p>Vision, too, takes on new concepts. Inconsiderable distances
become tremendous.... </p>

<p>Yet, throughout the intoxication, there is constant awareness
that the strange fancies rushing through the mind are not
natural, but purely the effects of the drug; unlike the
opium-cater, he is acutely conscious of those about him. He has
many of the sensations of the gay &quot;drunk&quot; at the ball. </p>

<p>Describing a pot-party: </p>

<p>There is little noise; windows are shut, keeping the smell of
smoking weeds away from what might be curious nostrils. </p>

<p>Nor is there any of the yelling, dashing about, playing of
crude jokes or physical violence that often accompany alcoholic
parties; under the effects of marihuana, one has a dread of all
these things. </p>
