MARKETING FIREPOWER AND PARTNERSHIPS WILL DETERMINE WINNER IN BATTLE
FOR DVD SHARE

  Competition among DVD hardware manufacturers is shaping up as a
marketing war in which the company that can take advantage of brand
name recognition, software cross-promotions and economies of scale has
the best chance of reaping top revenues.
      Thomson Consumer Electronics has a considerable edge, based
on the company's product positioning revealed at the recent 1996
Winter Consumer Electronics Show.
      The company expects to deliver product in late summer, likely
before any other vendor.
  On the manufacturing side, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
Ltd. will make DVD players for Thomson throughout 1996.  In exchange,
Thomson plans to manufacture digital satellite systems Matsushita will
sell under the Panasonic brand.  In 1997, Thomson will manufacture DVD
players and Matsushita will produce DSS systems.        
      "We're putting the band back together," said Joseph Clayton,
Thomson executive vice president for marketing and sales, referring to
the OEM agreement the company struck with Matsushita in 1970 in the
VCR category.  
      Thomson today commands roughly a 20 percent share in VCRs and
is aiming even higher with DVD.
      "What other company has three brands as powerful as RCA,
ProScan and GE?" said Guy Johnson, Thomson vice president for video
and multimedia.  "Nobody even comes close." 
Clayton's company will combine the manufacturing capabilities of
Matsushita with Thomson's worldwide presence, under such brand names
as Telefunken in Germany, Thomson in France and Saba throughout
Europe, for the DVD launch.  Such a massive product rollout translates
into economies of scale, which will mean a price advantage at retail.
       At press time, only two companies had announced DVD hardware
pricing.  Thomson plans to sell its basic model for $499, and Toshiba
America Consumer Products Inc. will bring in its entry-level model at
$599.  
      To let consumers know DVD is a technology that will not
become outdated anytime soon, Thomson is relying on alliances and
cross-promotions with content providers, namely Warner Home Video. 
Warner will release software titles concurrently for DVD and VHS.  The
company also plans to deliver the movies and properties already out on
VHS in DVD format.
      But Warner is not relying solely on Thomson to grow the DVD
software market.  The firm plans to co-market with Toshiba as well. 
  "We will co-promote with several hardware companies," said Warren
Lieberfarb, Warner Home Video president.  Lieberfarb described his
modus operandi as "counterintuitive" but said Warner "holds several
hardware co-patents on DVD components with Toshiba." 
       Toshiba executives promise to deliver hardware to retail
prior to Labor Day.
  Sony Corp., which will sell DVD hardware initially this fall, is
ramping up DVD software efforts.  Columbia/Tri-Star Home Video will
release 150 movies for DVD and plans to have 50 DVD titles available
to coincide with the hardware's launch.  Certain retailers who carry
Sony hardware also will sell the software. 
      In the marketing arena, Thomson has a decided advantage over
Toshiba, a company that promises to be among the top three share-
holders of DVD.

INTEL RAMPS UP NEXT-GENERATION CHIPS TO GIVE PC MAKERS MORE OPTIONS

  By taking advantage of a .35 micron manufacturing technology,
Intel Corp. will be able to boost production on its 150- and 166-MHz
processors quickly, giving PC manufacturers an ample supply of the
next-generation processors they need to enhance their products.
  "This is by far the single biggest ramp we've had in the Pentium
history," said Joanne Hasegawa, a spokeswoman for the company.  "We
expect to see systems right off the bat." 
  Typically it takes Intel several months to produce enough new
processors to  fill demand, but PC manufacturers that spoke with
Multimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams said they expect an ample supply
of the new chips.
  NEC Technologies Inc. last week made its 150 MHz Pentium Ready
9552 available.  
  Other vendors Intel is supplying with its first 150 MHz and 166
MHz Pentium chips in quantities initially include Gateway 2000, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard Co..  IBM's 166 MHz unit is available.  (Intel, 408/765-
7525.)

ATARI CORP. WILL BEGIN SELLING PC GAMES UNDER ITS NEW ATARI INTERACTIVE
DIVISION

  Hoping to leverage its library of video games including Pac Man and
Asteroids, Atari Corp. will begin selling PC games under its new Atari
Interactive division.  Analysts believe the company could have a tough
time selling its PC titles to retailers.  Atari has a history of poor
relationships with retailers because of overpromising titles, such as
its E.T. game, that flopped.  Atari has not had much success with its
Jaguar video-game console, which has sold approximately 200,000 units
since 1993.

MANUFACTURERS DISAGREE ON HOW MUCH DVD HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS CAN SELL 

  How much DVD hardware will manufacturers be able to sell in the
product's first few years on the market?  Manufacturers disagree. 
Thomson Consumer Electronics projects sales in the United States to
reach 4 to 5 million units in the product's first three years on the
market.  Sony Electronics Inc. offers a more conservative estimate: 
Five-hundred thousand units in the first year and 2 million in three
years.  Toshiba America Consumer Products Inc. puts the figure at 1
million units in DVD's first 12 months on the market.

CHIP INTEGRATION, 3D AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WILL STORM THE MARKET
IN 1996 

     Three-dimensional graphics, improved chip functionality and
enhanced communications are the top three developments expected to
penetrate the home market for multimedia in 1996.  But do not look for
any major changes on the multimedia landscape before the second half of
the year.
  Multimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams spoke with several key
manufacturers and industry analysts to find out what trends and
technologies vendors should prepare to capitalize on this year.  Here is
what they had to say:    

  ...When Will the 3-D Market Explode?

  The most visible enhancement expected in the software and chip
businesses will come in the form of 3-D games.
  "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew of
features and performance that just aren't available today," said Ken
Wirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.  "By
the end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number of PC
systems come 3-D enabled."
  Wirt said at least 10 new 3-D companies entered the market last
year.
  What could slow the trend toward better graphics?  Insufficient
software.
  Experts involved with the technology disagree about when it will
hit the market in full force.
  "There'll be enough titles in the second half, say the September to
October time frame, that 3D is going to be a mainstream part of the
market," said Murali Dharan, vice president of marketing for consumer
PCs, NEC Technologies Inc.  "You'll see a few hit titles, and that's all
that'll be required.  People have bought Sony PlayStation and Sega based
on much less."
  Barry Lebu, president and CEO of Jazz Multimedia Inc., is even more
bullish on 3D.
  "It's really going to explode," he said.  "You'll probably see two
dozen titles out there in the next 90 days."    

  ...More Functions, Fewer Chips

  Look for more consolidation in the chip industry, with companies
attempting to buy each other and integrate several functions onto a
single chip.
  "People who have had strong markets in one area [audio, video or
communications], are going to try to expand," NEC's Dharan said.  "I
wouldn't be surprised if S3 went out and bought some other companies. 
You might also see an established company (be it a single chip firm or
company that manufactures multi-functional chips) go out and gobble up a
specialty chip company."
  The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, but
more functions could be on the way.
  "There are some rumblings about communications," Wirt said. 
"There's a couple guys saying they are going to combine all this with
DSP."
  Such a move, however, requires keen timing and a heavy R&D
investment.
  "Video, audio and communications are three separate disciplines,
and you're competing against companies that all they do is one thing,"
Wirt said, adding that "development cycles aren't synched up exactly."   
  Whether these new chip designs make it to the motherboard is
another question.
  Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, an
enhancement of its next-generation processor with multimedia extensions,
sometime in 1996.
  "I don't think it will be ready until the second half of 1996,"
said Richard Chang, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. 

  ...Cable Modems On Hold

  Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means of
delivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in
1996.
  "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a game
through the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"
said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "It can
take you two days to download the video we put on a couple of CDs."
  Others agree.
  Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmission
companies will begin work on new services.  But delivering service is
another story.
  "Anything beyond analog modems requires either the cable companies
or the telephone guys to upgrade their systems in some way," he said. 
"I don't think anything like that is going to happen widespread in
1996."

  ...Improved Communications Means Content Enhancements

  Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modem
technology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digital
simultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.
  Many vendors added high-end modems to their top PC models in 1995,
but the  technology is far from mainstream.
  "That's likely to happen in the second half [of 96]," said NEC's
Dharan.
  As a result, consumers will be able to do more things with their
PCs.  For example, they might use the technology to peruse information
about airline flights and make a reservation at the same time.
  Activision, and several other publishers, plan to leverage modem
technology to make better use of the Internet.  In the company's
upcoming title Spycraft, users will get information fed to them from the
company's Web site.
  "We'll be able to deliver extra levels, but the core game engine
and the graphics have got to be delivered on a CD-ROM," said Tenn.

  ...Budgets Grow, But Prices Continue to Fall

  Activision spends about $2.5 million to $3 million on development
per title, and company vice president Tenn sees that number rising.  
  "This business requires deeper marketing dollars and greater and
grander tools," he said.
  Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.
  "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points," said
Robert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The average price
will go down because of the growth in the budget category.  It's going
to continue to sell."
  Activision's Tenn is not too concerned that the low-end titles will
bring down the prices of big-budget titles.
  "What you'll see is the back catalog will be priced down at $19 and
$20," he said.  "The consumer will continue to pay top dollar for the
top games."

  ..And on the Desktop Front

  Multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue to drop
prices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995 will
continue.
  "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that were
popular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst with
International Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 price
points, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refresh features.
  And what are those features?
  By third quarter, 6x and 8x speed CD-ROM drives will become
standard features on PCs, along with 28.8 Kbps modems and 16 MB of RAM.

PACKARD BELL'S FORAY INTO SOFTWARE IS TOO BIG A STRETCH, `DOOMED TO
FAILURE'  

     Packard Bell Electronics Inc. is attempting to extend its brand
name into the CD-ROM business, but industry watchers are skeptical about
how much clout the firm will carry with software buyers.
  The company launched its Active Imagination software brand last
February as a pilot program, but is ramping up a grander CD-ROM effort
with updated packaging, a new distributions strategy and a new name--
Packard Bell Interactive.  
  The division's leaders believe it can rely on the operations
strength of its parent company for administrative, shipping and other
functions involved with selling software.
  "That gives us the opportunity to start this company with far less
revenue than a new startup would need," said Glenn Uslan, vice president
of corporate marketing.
  Analysts are skeptical. 
  "I think if they're going to try for synergies it's doomed to
failure," said Lee Isgur, an analyst with Jeffries & Co. Inc.  "There is
no evidence that a hardware brand has any impact on the success of the
software brand."
  Key industry players agree with Isgur.
  "Rarely, if ever, has a hardware company truly understood
software," said Ben Tenn, vice president of sales for Activision Inc.
  An executive who got his start selling hardware for Panasonic, Tenn
pointed out that industry heavyweights Matsushita and Sony have not been
able to translate their hardware expertise into the content arena.  "And
that's on a grand scale with enormous talent and resources," Tenn said. 

  But Packard Bell executives believe they can make the transition.
  "Our software will be available to all Packard Bell retailers this
quarter," said Uslan. 
  For the past six months, the company has bundled a two-for-one
software coupon inside its hardware to encourage customers to buy Active
Imagination software at retail.
  "By bringing the customer back in to buy more, we have a direct
contact with 3 to 4 million customers a year," Uslan said.  
  On the content side, Packard Bell is outsourcing title development
and focusing on the children's education market.  Four new CD-ROMs are
expected at retail in the next few weeks.  
  Rose Studios Inc. of Redmond, Wash., developed Little Red Riding
Hood and Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  Australian-based Brilliant
Interactive Ideas Pty Ltd. developed Monster on the Loose and Dinosaur
in the Garden.
  Later this quarter, the company plans to bundle a copy of the
Yuckadoos, which hit retail last year under the Active Imagination
label, with every Packard Bell Interactive title.
  "We're hoping to sell 25,000 to 30,000 units in the first quarter
and give away that many," Uslan said.
  To aid the initiative, Packard Bell hired John Rutter, a former
marketing manager with Microsoft Corp., and Steve Boehm, who previously
held positions with Medio Multimedia and My Software Company.  (Packard
Bell Interactive, 818/735-7578; 206/654-4180.)
