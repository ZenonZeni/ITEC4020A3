<h1 align=center><i>Endo and Bowel Problems</i></h1>

<hr>


Dear AM<p>,
I have severe endo and had a laseroscopy in Feb and again last week.
In Feb, all the Dr. had time for was endo and adhesions.  Although I
had a history of endo of the bowel, it had never really bothered me.
A little diarrhea....that was about it.  The endo had been noted in both
my 1970 surgery and in my 1990 surgery, but not really dealt with.
During my surgery in Feb, the endo on my bowel looked so bad
that I had a colonscopy immediately following surgery to see if the
endo was invading the intestine.  Luckily, mine was not but it was
creating a severe constriction.  In fact, the GI Dr. said he wasn't
certain how I had even been going to the bathroom (and I had no
symptoms of this).  The danger was, I could have had a bowel
blockage which would have entailed emergency surgery, and probably
not allowed me to choose the specialist that I saw last week.<p>

I had 8 inches of large intestine removed last week via the
laparascope and am ready to return to work next week.  I also had a
spot on my rectum that was quite deep and could not be lasered.  The
dr. took a "wedge" out of this area (think of cutting a spot out and
then taking a tuck or dart in that area).  I feel terrific, and
after viewing my video, am <b>VERY</b> thankful that that piece of
intestine is no longer with me.<p>

<b>I don't think that it is normal to have rectal bleeding with our
period. </b> Please get it checked out by a good GI physician.  One <i>word of
caution</i>......most GIs don't seem to know much about endo so you need
to work with a GI and someone who knows endo.  Also, it was
important to me to find a surgeon who would do this operation
through the laparascope.  <p>
Good luck and let us know what's happening.<p>

     Hi, all.<p>

     Lisa G. and I have talked about Bowel endo before, but I think it may
     be worth pointing out to the whole group my own experience with
     invasive endo in the sigmoid colon.<p>

     I have always (since I was 15 or so) had nasty diarrhea with my period
     - the cramping and bloating and hot/cold sweats and nausea that many
     of you describe. This can probably be attributed to prostaglandins,
     and taking a NSAID along with either Benadryl (an antihistamine) or
     Immodium (an anti-diarrheal) or both really helps. <i>(Dr. Perloe: Somewhere the myth started that endometriosis only effects middleaged women.  NOT SO!  Endometrioisis can strike during the teens.  It's symptoms are progressive and difficult to deal with as many physicians do not suspect endometrioisis in this age group.)</i><p>

     About 2 years ago I started having that pressure inside feeling, like
     there was something blocking my colon and I couldn't get anything out
     past it. What finally would come out was mostly liquid. I usually had
     to camp out in the bathroom for an hour or so before I could stagger
     back to the comfort of my heating pad. The pain was intense to the
     point that I got tunnel vision and came close to blacking out. I also
     started passing large clots of blood and mucous in my BMs.<p>

     My doc refused to believe I was passing what appeared to be menstrual
     blood from my intestines until they did an "emergency" sigmoidoscopy.
     (Because of the pathology in my colon, this was very painful. If you
     are scheduled for one of these, have someone go with you to drive you
     home afterwards.) They found that my sigmoid colon was severely
     narrowed and had bleeding lesions on the inside, on the side closest
     to the uterus. A biopsy was inconclusive for endometrial tissue. <i> (Dr. Perloe: Biopsy at the time of sigmoidoscopy is indicated but rarely confirms the diagnosis.)</i>
     During my lap they found that the endometriosis had indeed penetrated
     the full thickness of the bowel wall.<p>

     My gynecological surgeon called in a bowel surgeon to consult. He
     resected (removed) about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of diseased bowel through
     the laparoscopic incision. This made the recovery from surgery a bit
     more difficult than if they had not had to do major bowel surgery - I
     was in the hospital for 10 days instead of going home right away.<i> (Dr. Perloe: Frequently patients can be discharged home 2-3 days after laparoscopic bowel resection.  Recovery is significantly quicker than abdominal surgery.)</i><p>

     I still have diarrhea and severe pain with my periods, but the most
     distressing bowel symptoms of not being able to get anything out and
     intestinal bleeding have gone away! It is an incredible relief to know
     that that piece of misery is out of my body and burned to ash in the
     hospital incinerator. My IBS symptoms in general are much improved
     since the surgery - 2-3 "attacks" a month (non-menstrually) vs. 2-3
     times a week pre-surgery.<p>

     My surgeon said my case was unusually severe, and full thickness
     resection is not usually needed for bowel endo. Endo on the bowel does
     not usually go all the way through the muscularis of the bowel wall,
     and often they can remove any lesions on the bowel without penetrating
     it, or just making a tiny hole in it and then sewing up the hole.<p>

     Adhesions on the outside of the colon were also contributing to my
     misery, narrowing the colon and adding to the obstruction caused by
     the engorged endo lesions. My doc described it as rubber bands wrapped
     around the intestine and uterus.<p>

     I don't mean to alarm anyone with this. I have found significant
     relief from the surgery, and even though the endo is back, the really
     bad bowel stuff is improved.<p>

     I hope this helps someone.<p>
