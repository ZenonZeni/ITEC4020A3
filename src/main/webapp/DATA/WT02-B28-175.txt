<STRONG>Is Your Tax Bite Growing?</STRONG>
<BR>

While a discussion about taxes may not be a topic of your nightly dinner conversation, it is an issue that concerns us all, and with good reason. In 1996, we spent over one-third of our time working for the government.
<P>
<STRONG>Tax Freedom Day</STRONG><BR>
According to an annual report issued by the Tax Foundation, Americans worked the first 127 days of 1996, from January 1 to May 6, just to pay taxes. In theory, this means that on May 7 your job began to
produce spendable income and your taxable investments became profitable. This
represents the latest Tax Freedom Day ever.
<P>
The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, took its
analysis one step further
and broke down the tax implications for each state. Connecticut was the unlucky
winner, bearing the nation's largest tax burden in 1996 with a Tax Freedom Day of May 31. Alabama sat
on the opposite end of this spectrum with a Tax Freedom Day of April 23.
<P>
<STRONG>The Eight Hour Work Day</STRONG><BR>
To put a different spin on the way Americans see their tax burden, the Tax
Foundation
examined the
portion of each eight hour working day necessary to pay federal, state, and local
taxes. In
1996, the
Foundation discovered that the average American spends 2 hours and 47 minutes each
working
day to
pay the necessary federal, state, and local taxes. This is more time than it takes
to pay for
food, shelter,
and clothing combined. Most of this time, 1 hour and 50 minutes, covers the federal
tax
portion. The
remainder, 57 minutes, covers state and local taxes. 
<P>
<STRONG>What Are Your Options?</STRONG><BR>
How can you reduce the time it takes to reach Tax Freedom Day next year? Ask
yourself three
simple
questions related to your financial situation in 1996:

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Did I receive 1099s from my bank accounts?
	<LI>Did I receive 1099s from other investments?
	<LI>Did I spend or reinvest the interest? 
</UL>
<P>
If you earned taxable interest on investments that you expect to hold for the long
term, then
you had to
pay current taxes on it. With taxable investments, the reality is that you don't
always
liquidate your
holdings to pay taxes. In all likelihood, you pay the tax out of current income or
out of
withholding from
other income sources. This technique reduces your spendable income today, and may
reduce it
in the
future. Fortunately, there are sensible strategies that will help you maximize
long-term
returns while
potentially reducing your tax bill. 
<P>
With investments like annuities, your earnings have the ability to accumulate on a
tax-deferred basis.
Simply put, you don't have to pay current taxes on money that is ear-marked for the
long
term. Instead,
all earnings are reinvested and continue to accumulate on a tax-deferred basis
until
withdrawn. Of
course, withdrawals of earnings from annuities are taxable and, if you are under
age <NOBR>59
1/2</NOBR>, may be
subject to a 10% tax penalty.
