<h3>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium (SETC)</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Multifuel Reformer/ Fuel Cell Hybrid Bus <p>
Performing Organization:  H Power Systems Corporation</B><p>




<P>Technical POC: Richard Johnson (916) 864-4980 </P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>This program will develop a compact multi-fuel fuel processor
and combine it with a PEM fuel cell stack scaled up from the precursor light duty fuel
cell vehicle project also headed by H Power. This scaled up system will be
demonstrated on JP8 (high grade jet fuel), or other medium distillate hydrocarbon
fuel, in a hybrid electric bus taking advantage of H Power's experience from our
DOE sponsored methanol powered fuel cell hybrid buses. </P>

<P>This type of bus propulsion offers the following key advantages: </P>

<UL>
<LI>     Greatly reduced emissions compared with conventional diesel engines. 
<LI>     Lower fuel costs through higher energy efficiency. 
<LI>     Lower projected operating and maintenance costs. 
<LI>     Use of logistical fuels for military and widespread commercial applications.
<LI>     Competitive projected system power density and cost. </UL>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>This project will result in the development of a 50 to 70 kilowatt PEM fuel cell system
that operates on JP8 fuel, integrated into a hybrid electric bus for test,
demonstration, and further development. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P>Fuel processor development and testing will be complete in Spring of 1997. Design
and testing of the fuel cell power system will be complete in Fall of 1997, leading to
full integration into the demonstration bus by early 1998. </P>

<P>A reforming fuel processor will be used that can run on logistic fuels, including
gasoline, diesel and JP8. The fuel processor will provide for sulfur removal and CO
reduction to a level compatible with PEM fuel cell operation. A closed loop water
recovery system will collect fuel cell product water for the fuel processor.</P>

<P>This project deals with the PNGV recognized challenges of:</P> 

<P><UL>
<LI>     thinner and lighter weight separator plates of metal and other base materials; 
<LI>     polymer membrane optimization; and 
<LI>     mass production platelet fabrication methods with the potential for very low cost separator plate designs. </UL></P>

<P>Our performance objectives include matching the power density of internal
combustion diesel propulsion systems in 2001.</P>
