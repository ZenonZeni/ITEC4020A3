<h1>A Short History of Amphetamines </h1>

<p> <b>From: &quot;Drugs and the Brain&quot; by Solomon H Snyder</b>
</p>

<p> Ephedrine was discovered by K. K. Chen, who was looking for a
substitute for Adrenalin as an antiathsmatic. Chen was curious
about Chinese herbal medicine, in particular ma huang. He and
other Lilly chemists quickly isolated ephedrine, and verified
that it widened bronchial passages. Since Adrenalin couldn't be
taken orally, and had a hell of a side-effect ephedrine seemed
vastly preferable. The rarity of ma huang quickly sent chemists
scrambling for a synthetic ephedrine, and sometime in the 30's,
one of them stumbled on Amphetamine. </p>

<p> Amphetamine was also a bronchiodilator, and could be inhaled
directly, delivering the relief within seconds. It was marketed
under the name Benzedrine and quickly became a legal, over the
counter, recreational drug. </p>

<p> ..from a 1937 Journal of the American Medical Association </p>

<p> &quot;Benzedrine Tablets were used at the department for
Psychology at the University of Minnesota to study ... effects on
human thought. It was found that the substance increased
alertness... Apparently, the effectiveness of the drug in
delaying the onset of sleep has induced many University of
Minnesota students so seek the drug in local Pharmacies.&quot; </p>
