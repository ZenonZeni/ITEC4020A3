<h1 align=center>Quality Education for Teachers<br> and Special Education Students</h1>

<p><b>by Don Bishop, Secretary, ACLD Foundation</b>

<p>We are often concerned after making  presentations on special
education  law and the rights of persons with disabilities that teachers
in the audience may be  offended. This stems from the similarity of  
parent complaints: the teacher refuses to  comply with the their child’s
IEP, or the teacher subjects our children to unfair and  unnecessary
disciplinary sanctions, and in  some cases the teacher simply does not  
seem to care. So, if we, speaking as lawyers  who represent many parents,
offend teachers it is because our clients demand that we  do so. Our
usual defense, however, is that  it is the law and the requirements of 
the law  that upset teachers and we, lawyers, are  merely the messengers.

<p>Upon calm reflection, one must wonder what it is about lawyers that
upsets teachers and school personnel. Is it the way we present issues,
blaming the problems on the school administration and teachers? Or, is it
the requirements of the law (IEPs, related services, dealing with
parents)? While either of the above reasons would be sufficient to upset
teachers, we really believe that it was neither but was something else.
Presenting the requirements of the law merely contributed to and gave
focus to a sense of frustration and possibly anger that was there before
the presentation. The <i>something else</i>, we believe, are the
restraints keeping the professional teacher from doing a professional job.

<p>We sometimes lose sight of the fact that whether we are lawyers,
teachers, factory workers, entrepreneurs, or public service employees, we
all have some attributes in common. If we are successful, it 
is because we have found a method of doing things that leads to success. 

<p><i>Success</i> as we use the term is adding <i>quality</i> to whatever
we do. To the factory worker success is producing a better, more reliable
product while to the entrepreneur success may be earning higher profits
or capital appreciation. To lawyers, success is making our clients happy
or, at a minimum, reducing their unhappiness to an acceptable level. To
teachers, however, success is feeling that sense of accomplishment when
one sees the incidents of self esteem blossom in a student as it becomes 
clear that the student is learning what the teacher is teaching and
perhaps much more. The teacher's vision and goal is growth and happiness
for their students in the sense of the students' realization of their 
individual potential as reflected by each student's individual abilities.    

<p>Like the rest of us, teachers have developed and honed their skills
over the years by improving on the methods that were successful and
discarding the methods that resulted in failure until reaching a point of 
adopting specific teaching methods which work well for the majority of
students.

<p>It is no wonder that the teacher becomes frustrated to the point of
anger when given a student with learning disabilities, who not only
defies all known teaching methods, but reacts to his or her frustration 
at being unable to learn like the others by disrupting the class. This
student who inherently wants to please the teacher does the opposite, and
it frustrates the teacher, who inherently wants the student to 
learn and be successful.

<p>This is not only a problem today, but it was the situation 20 years
ago which was one of the reasons Congress passed PL 94-142. One would
think that we should have corrected the situation by now. Thus, the real
issue is, <b>why hasn't it been corrected? </b> If a factory worker were
experiencing 7% to 12% rejects in the product being manufactured, that
worker would not only not feel successful, the business would probably be
near bankruptcy. By analogy, is our education program with its 7% to 12% 
failure rate near bankruptcy? If we can use our assets wisely, the answer
is no. If we waste our assets, bankruptcy is inevitable. <i>Our assets
that need to be used wisely are the wisdom and the integrity of the 
professional teacher</i>.    

<p>Let us suggest as an opening premise that any teacher proud of his or
her profession would very much look forward to IEP meetings if the
teacher (1) knew at the time what would be a successful program for a 
student with learning disabilities; (2) were free to prescribe the
program, and (3) the school had the ability and the willingness to
implement the program. In such events, the object of the IEP meeting
would be focused on obtaining the parents' input and the parents' help.
So why do teachers dread IEP meetings?    

<p>Anyone in business will tell you that quality is added at the factory
floor and not from the headquarters. By the same token, educational
quality is added in the classroom -- nowhere else. The federal laws
(IDEA, Section 504) assume this premise by directing the IEP to be
developed on the educational "factory floor", i.e. the classroom. We
suggest that it is time for school administrators to assume that same
premise and let teachers be the professionals that they are trained to be
and they have learned to be. This would remove the first restraint.   

<p>The quality problem in special education is the realization that
either no one knows a prescription that 
will ensure success for students with learning disabilities or, more
probably, those who know are either 
afraid to say or have no incentive to say what would be successful. This
is the second restraint, i.e. silence 
attributable to fear or lack of incentive to develop a successful plan.
Thus the teacher enters the IEP with 
restraints self-imposed or imposed by the school administration and with
little hope of success. The 
teacher feels professionally inadequate as a result. The teacher at the
IEP meeting is in very much in the 
same position that the student with learning disabilities is in when in
the classroom, i.e. an overwhelming 
dread of facing up to his or her own inadequacy in that particular
environment. No matter what the 
outcome in either the IEP meeting or the classroom, there is a very high
probability that both the teacher 
and the student will be frustrated.

<p>One law (the truancy law) makes the student with learning disabilities
attend school and another law 
(IDEA) makes the teacher attend IEP meetings. Simply stated, the law
forces both into an environment 
they both dread and find frustrating. It should not be surprising that
both react in the same manner. 
Frustration leads to anger. The anger of both the student and the teacher
is directed at the nearest 
representative of the frustrating cause -- each other. The normal and
predictable reaction of anger born of 
frustration is either <i>fight</i> or <i>flight</i>. The student
<i>fights</i> with disruptive behavior. The 
teacher fights with stonewalling the IEP. Alternatively, the student
takes <i>flight</i> with depression 
followed by truancy followed by social drop-out. The teacher takes flight
by resorting to alternative 
disciplinary programs or other measures (resource room) to get the cause
of frustration out of sight.

<p>It is a strange paradox that both the teacher and the student are really comrades-in-arms on different 
sides of the same battle. The student suffers with learning disabilities for regular education and the teacher 
suffers with teaching disabilities for special education. Both disabilities result in frustration and anger 
directed at the law or laws which throw them together in an environment that high lights their respective 
disabilities. 

<p>Unfortunately, the law cannot add quality. Only people can add quality. The frustration with the law 
and the anger directed toward its messengers (lawyers) will begin to subside when the teachers with 
teaching disabilities and the students with learning disabilities begin to experience success, i.e. when 
quality is added to the educational process for each. To begin the search for quality, the fight or flight 
reactions can no longer be viable alternatives. Educational bankruptcy will occur as an inevitable 
consequence if there is continual failure to address the underlying problem which prevents quality 
education for persons with disabilities.

<p>Most businesses nowadays address quality problems with a team approach. The IEP team is the team 
approach contemplated by the law. In this sense the law was ahead of its time. The team approach cannot 
function, however, until the frustration, anger, and resentment is addressed and resolved. This will occur 
when the team members (parents and teachers) recognize their own limitations and look to other members 
of the team as people with special expertise that can help. The next barrier to success will be removed 
when the teacher responds as an independent professional and not as a spokesperson for the school 
administration. When professional teachers can put the full force of their cumulative wisdom gained from 
professional training and classroom experience to developing methods to respond to the needs of students 
with learning disabilities, they will find an effective way to add quality to their teaching and to their 
students’ learning.  

<p>We, the parents and the lawyers who have lost faith in the educational system, do have faith in the 
law. But, more importantly, the law still has faith in teachers. By simply following the spirit as well as the 
letter of the law, teachers will be free to be professional. They need not perjure themselves to protect the 
administration's policies. They need not corrupt their professional integrity by remaining silent when their 
professional opinion is sought and needed. They need not undermine their professional authority by 
placating to the outspoken parent with promises and platitudes. They need not diminish their own self-
esteem by disrespect of the parents or the problem student. The laws are designed to free them from 
restraints. When that freedom -- the freedom to be a professional teacher -- is achieved, quality education 
will begin.
