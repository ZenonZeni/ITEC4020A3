<H4><u>Racism</u></H4>
Racism is more than telling ethnic jokes. It is a deep-rooted attitude which influences the way people view the world and upon which they base their personal interactions. Racist ideas fall on a continuum starting with stereotypes and biases to fully developed theories of racist superiority which may be held unconsciously.
<p>
The racism most of us encounter on a day-to-day basis is usually subtle.
<p>
Our physical features and how people react to us heavily influences how we view ourselves. Subtle forms of racism, like racist jokes, insidiously attack a person's identity, eat at one's self esteem, invade one's dreams and can render a person helpless to self determine.
<p>
Adults do not necessarily have a monopoly on racism. Youth who themselves are forming an identity and questioning the status quo in so many area can be cruel and heartless, unthinkingly perpetuating racial myths and racist behaviour.
<p>
Do not minimize the importance of dealing with racism. If you feel you are subject to racism, you should speak to someone about it. Your close friends sometimes do not even understand how something which seems harmless to them can affect you negatively.
A school counsellor, a teacher whom you trust, or a parent who can empathize may be able to help develop strategies to deal with racism. There are also community and provincial organizations which have expertise in this area and may be able to guide you.
If you recognize racism in yourself, you too need help. It is not healthy to find your own identity and power by ridiculing or destroying someone else's. Speak about it with someone who can help.
