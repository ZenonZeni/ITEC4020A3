STAR/WEB TURBOCHARGES DATA ACCESS VIA WEB BROWSERS

"Nobody does real database searches on the Web," goes one
common complaint from observers of today's booming interest in
the Internet, and particularly the World Wide Web.  Such
comments reflect the fact that much of the information
available on the Net is not yet organized for access using
well-established information retrieval techniques.

Now that will change, with the introduction by Los
Angeles-based Cuadra Associates of STAR/Web, an option to the
company's powerful STAR information management and retrieval
software. STAR/Web is a common gateway interface (cgi-bin)
program that connects STAR software to any standard or
commercial World Wide Web server (http daemon). With STAR/Web,
database administrators can let users of their Web hosts or
hosts on their in-house networks use common web browsers, such
as Mosaic or Netscape Navigator, to search with ease for
information organized and structured into online databases.

Provides lightning fast in-depth searches

STAR/Web offers database administrators a simple way to set up
fully interactive, fast data retrieval for users of Web
browsers for complex searches by users who may know little or
nothing about the structure and content of the data. STAR/Web
is ideal for searching databases significant in size and in
the types of information catalogued. STAR sites include
libraries, museums, archives, government agencies, and other
institutions with catalogs of unique print and non-print
collections. When any of these organizations make their STAR
databases available on the Internet through a STAR/Web host,
users will be able to find hidden treasures of photographic
and film collections, as well as literature in many different
disciplines.

STAR/Web customizable assisted-search capabilities give
end-users heightened information retrieval power without
having to become experts in formulating good searches or to
invest in extensive training for many different databases.
System administrators can design web pages for full-text or
index searches that include multiple input boxes. Index
displays on the assisted search screens help end-users select
applicable search terms to be pasted into the appropriate
input boxes-with copy and paste done automatically.
Administrators may pre- define applicable Boolean, proximity,
and ranging operators for the assisted searches.

STAR/Web sites can commercialize their online services with
ordering facilities (e.g., for full-text document delivery;
reproductions of photographs or slides). If STAR/Web is used
in-house, "service" centers can fulfill requests
enterprise-wide for library books, journal articles, file
folders, and other materials found through searching with
STAR/Web. Web pages and input boxes used with STAR/Web
maintain their state while the user views the initial results
of the search. When users select a hypertext link,
conventional search engines immediately forget what the user
entered as search text. As STAR/Web users move from searching
to displaying results, displaying linked files, or selecting
terms from an index display for automatic pasting, STAR/Web
tracks and remembers what the user has entered and selected-to
provide a true interactive retrieval model.

Eliminates HTML programing staff and time

STAR/Web minimizes the overhead in becoming a Web host by
using information already organized in the main
database-whether it is descriptions of items in a collection,
or the full text of documents. And, STAR/Web takes the hassle
out of designing and managing many Web pages for large
collections because it does the translation into HTML
specifications.

"The system administrator uses STAR to set up one or many
assisted searches. These are translated by STAR/Web into
complete HTML specifications (e.g., using table formats and
other sophisticated HTML conventions). Standard STAR reports,
for sorting and presenting users' search results in many
different ways-with online images and hypertext are easily
deaned in STAR as HTML documents. With STAR and STAR/Web, our
sites are up and running fast, with high-quality services
operating in a totally standard Web environment," said Judith
Wanger, vice president of Cuadra Associates, Inc.

Pricing for the STAR/Web option depends on the number of
simultaneous users to be supported. For the typical STAR
system, STAR/Web adds about $240 per simultaneous user to the
system price.  STAR/Web requires STAR, the highly acclaimed
Unix-based software for managing, accessing and presenting all
types of information from corporate and other institutional
databases.

1390.

"ENTREPRENEURAL LIBRARIANSHIP" PROVIDES ESSENTIAL
READING FOR LIBRARY AND INFO SERVICES PROFESSIONALS

Like so many other modern businesses, library management has
entered a new era of accountability.  Libraries must now be
run in much the same way as a successful corporation, with a
focus on responsibility, performance and control. For some
librarians and information managers, this can represent a
dramatic change from the traditional library setting.

But naming an effective, cost-efficient library need not be an
overwhelming task. The same management methods that work for
other businesses can easily be implemented in the library
setting as well.

NEW VOLUME PROVIDES CLEAR AND CONCISE
GUIDELINES AND TECHNIQUES

A new handbook from Bowker-Saur -- "Entrepreneurial
Librarianship: The Key to Effective Information Management,"
by Guy St. Clair -- applies contemporary management and
business techniques to the fields of library science and
information services. Written specifically for this field, the
volume gives users timely management theory they can use to
improve customer service, establish an entrepreneurial
management environment, develop power and influence within an
organization, and improve the quality of the services they
provide.

Entrepreneurial Librarianship offers practical techniques for
creating an entrepreneurial environment in a library or
information services organization, and provides ideas for
initiating such techniques where a less successful operation
is already in place. Specific topics include taking risks,
cultivating teamwork, and displaying leadership.

This definitive guidebook enables library professionals to:

* define entrepreneurial management.

* convince those who are resistant to change.

* adapt the characteristics of successful businesses to the
library setting.

For more information, call 800-521-8110.

PIONEER-STANDARD ELECTRONICS, INC. JOINS INTERNET COMMUNITY

Customers, Suppliers and Investors Gain Access to the Latest
Information on Company Products, Services, and Financials.

Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PIOS), a leading
North American distributor of industrial electronic
components, computers and peripheral equipment, has added a
new tool to help customers and suppliers get immediate access
to the information they need -- a home page on The Internet's
World Wide Web (http://www.pios.com).

"We designed our home page to act as an inviting and easy to
use electronic magazine," says Art Rhein, Senior Vice
President of Sales and Marketing. "It includes headline
stories, colorful maps, and a table of contents that provides
a sneak preview of what's inside. Like a magazine, it changes
monthly, but unlike one, you can click on a map, a headline or
a menu item to immediately jump to where you want to go."

Customers can click on a map of Pioneer's 53 offices to find a
contact name, address, phone or fax number. Other hot-button
items take the user to a graphically rich menu of company
products and services; electronic versions of full-color sales
brochures and collateral. News stories about Pioneer as well
as press releases and copies of annual and quarterly reports
are also one click away.

Pioneer's web site is also inter-active. E-mail messages can
be forwarded to any Pioneer employee through the Internet. The
home page also reaches far beyond Pioneer itself. From its
listing of current suppliers and products, users can click on
the listed company to reach that company's home page, if one
exists.

Other enhancements to Pioneer's web site are in the works.

Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., and its 50% owned
affiliate, Pioneer Technologies group, Inc. is a
billion-dollar plus systems solutions company with more than
50 sales and technical offices throughout North America.

ELECTRONIC MARKETING WILL GENERATE
$230 BILLION OF SALES BY 2000

Electronic Media to Gain Acceptance as Security Concerns are
Resolved

Worldwide sales of goods and services through CD-ROM catalogs,
on-line storefronts and Internet malls will grow from $700
million in 1995 to $230 billion by 2000, a compound annual
growth rate of more than 200%, according to INPUT, the
information technology market intelligence firm.  Although a
large portion of the current sales occur through the shopping
areas of on-line services such as Prodigy and CompuServe, most
of the growth will be through Internet's World Wide Web.

Steve Young, Manager of INPUT's Electronic Commerce Program,
says: "The explosive growth in sales is good news for those
pioneer companies currently marketing through these electronic
media, many of which are learning hard lessons about the
difficulty of getting customers to change their behavior and
accept the use of technology in the buying process."

INPUT research finds that these barriers are about to break
down as confidence builds that network security, including
transaction privacy and trading partner authentication can be
attained. Netscape Communications, Enterprise Integration
Technology, Teisa Systems and RSA Data Security, are leading
providers of security technology, and notwithstanding the
recent rash of negative publicity, they have the capability to
offer a secure environment. As user acceptance increases, a
business infrastructure is developing to support electronic
marketing. This includes the electronic "landlords" (such as
marketplaceMCI), Internet Service Providers (such as Netcom),
software vendors (such as Netscape), system integrators (such
as Andersen Consulting), and advertising services (such as
Ogilvy & Mather).

As part of its continuing commitment to international
expansion, Global Access Telecommunications Services, Inc., a
leading provider of worldwide satellite and fiber transmission
services for the television and video industry, has opened its
Singapore office.  Global Access' Singapore subsidiary, Global
Satellite and Video Services (Asia) Pte Ltd., headed by Simon
Patch, director of brainess development, Asia Pacific, will
coordinate business for the entire Asia Pacific region.

The newest Global Access office, headquartered in Singapore's
New Tech Park, will be providing broadcast services for a
number of significant customers in the Asia Pacific region,
including ESPN in SingVore, STAR-TV in Hong Kong, and Fuji
Television and Nippon Television in Tokyo. In delivering
satellite transmission services to the Asia Pacific market,
Global Access draws upon 13 years of experience in providing
satellite and fiber broadcast services worldwide.

"As the Asia Pacific broadcast television market explodes,
Global Access is poised to build on the satellite services we
have been providing the region for years," said Jack Morse,
president and CEO of Global Access. "We have experienced staff
with intimate knowledge of the local broadcast market and
issues, and our multilingual Singapore operations center is
seamlessly integrated into our U.S. and U.K. offices. With the
leadership of Simon Patch, we can provide our Asia Pacific
clients with around-the-clock, around-the-world services."

telecommunications industry to the position of business
development director, has also served as a vice president at
Keystone Communications and business director for Visnews.
Global Access' Singapore-based staff also includes Denise
Lekowski, international services coordinator. Lekowski, most
recently international liaison for Keystone Communications,
brings to the new operation years of expertise in the local
and international market. In addition to its local staff,
Global Access' Boston-based Keith Buckley, vice president,
sales, and Robert McNamara, director, international
operations, will put their combined industry and market
expertise to work for the Singapore operation.

Global Access' expansion into the Asia Pacific arena coincides
with the company's fast-paced European growth. Earlier this
year, Global Access acquired Business Television Services Ltd.
(BTS), a U.K.-based provider of business television and
special event services. BTS, now known as Global Access
Telecommunications Services Ltd., has been fully integrated
into Global Access' European operation, which offers both
business services to major corporations and broadcast services
for news, sports, and special events.

extend their market reach by applying our strengths in CD-ROM
technology and distribution to their world-class patent
information. Results from the KR OnDisc CD-ROM Energy Cluster
have exceeded projections and the Derwent Petroleum and Power
Engineering CD with images will enjoy the benefits of our
focus in this area."

Paul Gardner, managing director and CEO, Derwent Information
Limited, noted that "We are very excited about this new
venture with Knight-Ridder as it demonstrates again both
