<B>Project Title:  Dual-Use Turbogenerator Development<p>

Performing Organization:  AlliedSignal Aerospace</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:	Charles Weinstein (310) 512-4127</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>AlliedSignal Aerospace is developing and will deploy a 50-kw turbogenerator in dual-use applications.  The turbogenerator was placed into an M-1 A-1 tank and will be placed into an electric bus operated by Delco Electronics. </P> 

<P>Advances in this turbogenerator include the use of  air bearings, which eliminate the need for oil or other lubricants.  the generator is built into the shaft and rotates at the same speed as the shaft, so there is no gearbox, which eliminates a considerable number of moving parts.  The unit was designed to be low cost, compact, and quiet.  This turbogenerator could contribute to the development of a hybrid electric vehicle capable of exceeding the mileage goal of the Partnership for a Next Generation Vehicle (PNGV).  </P>

<P>AlliedSignal is a company with $14 billion in sales.  The Garrett Automotive Group within AlliedSignal is the World's largest manufacturer of automotive turbo-machinery.  AlliedSignal is also the World's largest supplier of small gas turbines.  </P>
	
<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>The turbogenerator will be developed and installed in the Delco Electronics test bus in 1996.</P>
