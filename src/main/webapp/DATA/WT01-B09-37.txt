<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Developing Competitive and Collaborative Partnerships</FONT></h3>


<P>
Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle Consortium
is &quot;powering the future&quot; through its non-profit association
of private sector companies, universities and public sector organizations,
partnering in the development of advanced electric vehicle technologies
and related infrastructure. Acting in an atmosphere of competitive
collaboration and in partnership with the Department of Defense
through the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), <B>the consortium
has invested in a 1:1 match of private monies</B> with public
funds to support almost <B>$20 million of advanced</B> research
and development projects.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The Electricore Mission</FONT></h3>

<p>

Electricore's success is founded on our commitment
to:<P><ul> 
<li> Pursue research and development activities and demonstrate enabling
electric and hybrid electric vehicle technologies that are appropriate
to both commercial applications and military missions, functions
and usefulness;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Demonstrate scalable technology with reduced
size and weight advantages, economic viability, increased reliability
and performance and energy savings and environmental goals;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Analyze and develop innovative processes for system and component
manufacturing which can combine common military and commercial
technologies for reduced engineering and manufacturing costs;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Design and develop the appropriate and applicable infrastructure
to support the introduction and public acceptance of electric
vehicle technologies;</FONT>
<P>

<li> Ensure maximum return on the joint investment
of funds through strict accountability and efficient program management.
<P></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3>

<p>Electricore's accomplishments include:</FONT>
<P>
Vehicle demonstration for 15 electric pick-ups and infrastructure
implementation</B> at the military sites of TACOM (Tank Automotive
Command) in Warren, Michigan, and Naval Surface Warfare Center,
Crane Division in Crane, Indiana;<BR>

Electric vehicles in use in Indiana. The Electric pick-up
truck is part of Electricore's development activities. This electric
bus, in service in Anderson, Indiana, was manufactured by Electricore
participant AVS.</i></b></blockquote><p><br clear = all><br>


<P><b>Design, development and manufacture of
one military and two civilian buses. </FONT></B>The
buses are to be tested and demonstrated at the military sites
of TACOM in Warren, Michigan, and Naval Surface Warfare Center,
Crane Division in Crane, Indiana, and the cities of Indianapolis,
Indiana and Chattanooga, Tennessee;
</FONT>
<P><a href="/image/arpas95o.gif"><img border = 0 align = right src="/image/arpas95o1.gif" alt =""></a><blockquote><b><i>

Teaching the next generation about electric
vehicle technology under Electricore's unique education program
for grades 5-12 called &quot;Teach the Technology.&quot;</i></b></blockquote><p><br clear = all><br><p>

<B>Public Acceptance and Information Dissemination
activities</FONT></B> involve the development of
an electric vehicle information center, in conjunction with the
Tennessee Valley Authority, the Electric Vehicle Research Network,
Electricore, Chattanooga Area Regional Transit Authority and the
City of Chattanooga;

<P><B>Educational outreach activities</FONT></B>
include the development of technology dialogues providing noncompetitive
forums for data exchange and personal interchange among regional,
industry, and university systems; the design and distribution
of &quot;Teach the Technology&quot; reaching students in grades
5-12 enhancing the study of science and mathematics;</FONT>
<P>
<B>Development of performance criteria and
measurement tools for electric vehicles</FONT></B>
to support the development of the necessary infrastructure for
support of successful EV introduction, which includes the design
of the patented portable Alpha electronic meter for EV charging
analysis;</FONT>
<P>

<B>Development of advanced components</B> for electric vehicles,
including an air conditioning system that is lightweight, modular,
high performance, environmentally friendly, with a low vapor pressure
HFC refrigerant. The system uses advanced aerospace turbine technology,
high efficiency permanent magnet brushless motors and advanced
motor controller technology. This AC system is applicable to all
civilian and military vehicles using electric drives including
surface, air and water craft;</FONT>
<P>
<B>Development of a complete parallel hybrid electric vehicle
(HEV) scheme </B>which is scalable to large tracked combat vehicles
and civilian applications. This HEV systems integration connects
propulsion system units to achieve improved efficiencies for electric
and hybrid electric applications.<BR>
