"FUTURISTIC" MICROCELL PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK PROPOSED FOR
U.S.

     In the first proposal for microcell communication by a major
U.S. company, a subsidiary of Millicom, Inc. has petitioned the FCC
to set aside frequencies in the 1.7 to 2.3 GHz range for a new
mobile phone service based on microcell radio architecture.  PCN
America, Inc. said that its proposed Personal Communications
Network would be similar to the PCNs being proposed in the United
Kingdom and under consideration in Europe and Japan.  Millicom is
a member of a consortium (with Pacific Telesis International, Matra
Communications and British Aerospace Space Systems) that has
applied in the United Kingdom for a license for a PCN.  Licenses
are expected to be awarded in a few months, with service by 1992.
     The deadline for comments on the PCNA petition is December 18,
1989.  Reply comments are due January 3, 1990.
     The basic concepts of PCN, said PCNA, are:
     1) The network should link persons, not stations;
     2) It should allow voice, data and image transmission; and
     3) It should make the most efficient possible use of the
frequency spectrum.
     Applying these principles, PCNA proposes to install a
nationwide network of microcell radio base stations wherever people
congregate.  These would include business and residential
neighborhoods, and in office buildings.  The PCN technique includes
handoffs from cell to cell permitting slow speed mobility (but not
while driving).  PCNA proposed low-powered, wallet sized handsets
that would be activated by a smart card inserted by the user.
Since the smart card is personalized to each user, the network
would recognize the identity of a caller for billing purposes.  A
user away from home would be able to receive as well as initiate
calls if he or she logs in at a network base station and notifies
the network of his or her willingness to accept calls from all or
a particular class of callers.  PCNA said that the intelligence in
the network, combined with the ability to locate any user who has
logged in, will permit the "ability to reach a party with a
communication of a type specifically tailored for receipt by that
party" regardless of his or her location.  The PCN microcell radio
system would be well adapted for cordless PABX's in office
environments.
     The network architecture would be based on the Signalling
System 7 protocol (SS-7) which will allow such "futuristic"
features such as selective call ringing and rejection, virtual
private networks, "wide-area" Centrex, and ISDN features.  To
maximize spectrum reuse, PCNA proposes to use CDMA or similar
spread-spectrum techniques, rather than the TDMA used in DECT or
the FDMA used in the British CT2 system.
     The Chief Engineer of the FCC, Dr. Thomas Stanley,  commented
that his agency welcomes proposals such as this, and is already
engaged in an in-depth study of the concept of personal
communications systems.  He said that the FCC expects to issue a
Notice of Inquiry in the spring of 1990, and the PCNA petition
would be considered in the context of that inquiry, along with
another petition filed by Cellular 21, Inc. for a CT2-type
Telepoint system.
     PCNA  has proposed a service that is far in advance of the
CT2-based  Telepoint system being implemented in the U.K., and
proposed for the U.S. (see separate stories), and could cut into
the cellular market if it can be brought in at a reasonable price
(only the market for the cellular users who must have phone service
while driving will be immune).  CT2 does not allow for calls to be
received, and cannot be used for data or fax transmissions, far
less allow the Centrex-type features promised by PCNA.
     PCN would have convenience and cost marketing advantages over
cellular.  As a low-powered radio (around 10 milliwatts) the
handset would be much smaller than current  models - around half
the size and weight of the Motorola 950 Microtac model, if the
British Telepoint phones are a guide, and its batteries would last
perhaps ten times as long.  PCNA did not estimate the cost of
either hardware or service over the proposed PCN, but since
hardware prices and investment costs per subscriber of a CT2
microcell system are far below those of conventional cellular, it
seems likely that a PCN could significantly underprice cellular.
     Installation of a nation-wide PCN is not around the corner,
but must await the conclusion of the FCC inquiry into personal
communication systems.  According to Dr. Stanley, that inquiry will
probably take about a year from its start in the spring.  If the
FCC then approves the concept and allocates frequencies,
applications for licenses will be accepted.  Some kind of lottery
system is likely if the volume of applications is great.  Only
after some applications are granted would construction of the
network start, and this timetable could be set back if the FCC
decides to await the outcome of the World Administrative Radio
(WARC) conference scheduled for 1992.

U.S. COMPANIES PLANNING MICROCELL NETWORKS

   In addition to Millicom, Inc. (see lead story), at least three
United States companies are  preparing to set up microcell
communications systems - two using the CT2 technology developed in
Great Britain, and one seeking to overlay a microcell radio
technology on existing cellular systems.  A third approach to
Telepoint based on the Digital European Cordless Telephone standard
(DECT) is slated for trials on an interim basis by Ericsson Radio,
Inc.  All of these approaches have potential to create Telepoint
networks across America.  CT2 has the advantage of being already
operational in the U.K. and of requiring very low capital
investment, but has little or no radio spectrum immediately
available.  Additionally, as an out-bound only system, CT2 may not
satisfy the needs of U.S. users.  The existing cellular systems
already have frequencies available and are two-way, but adding
cells is expensive, and cellular operators may not be willing to
give up frequencies for a lower-priced service.  DECT is
intermediate between the CT2 and cellular concepts.  It uses
microcell technology to provide two-way call, but is more expensive
than CT2, and cannot be used while driving.  Each approach has its
proponents, and the competition between them will be worth
watching.  The two major differences between CT2 and cellular-- CT2
is outgoing only (outside of the home), and cannot be used while
driving -- means that Telepoint's target market will be different
from that of cellular.  Additionally the anticipated low cost of
each handset (perhaps $150 at first, eventually going to $75 or
below) focusses Telepoint's appeal on a different segment of the
population than cellular.
     The companies initiating trials are:

Corporate Technology Partners

     CTP is a group of venture capitalists in San Diego seeking to
assemble capital, technology and know-how for a Telepoint network
based on the CT2 system in operation in the United Kingdom.  It
claims to have most of the capital and hardware arrangements in
place for a trial system.  Tests of a prototype will begin in the
first half of 1990, claims Charles Mason, the president of CTP.
The test will use handsets and base stations purchased from a
British manufacturer, transmitting in the same 864-868 MHz as the
U.K.,band on an experimental basis.  If the trial is successful CTP
anticipates installing Telepoint systems on a city-by-city basis in
the United States.

International Mobile Marine.

     IMM is preparing to conduct a test of a Telepoint system in
cooperation with a cellular telephone operator, using cellular
techniques and frequencies.  Initially one microcell will be
established then a pilot program with several cells in a
metropolitan area.  George Calhoun, President of IMM, which is
based in Philadelphia, said that he expected the experiment to be
conducted in the first half of 1990.  While his company has already
conducted some one-cell trials in Philadelphia, he wants to have a
more realistic test using many more handsets in an urban
environment.  IMM's experimental system will use TDMA digital
technology, with separate transmit and receive channels, and using
cellular frequencies.  The initial trials will focus on voice
capability only, but eventually , according to IMM, Telepoint will
accommodate data transmission up to 128 kbs and fax.
     IMM's aim is to develop a base unit, not the handset.  IMM
seeks the best parameters of a system that will work in congested
urban areas.  Calhoun said that while some cellular operators would
not want to give up any of their precious frequencies to set up a
Telepoint system, if the peak period for cellular traffic turns out
to be different from the peak period for Telepoint traffic, then
cellular  frequencies could be economically used for both services.

Cellular 21.

     Like CTP, Cellular 21, of Rutherford, N.J., will be working
with CT2.  Matthew Edwards, the president, said that it has already
received experimental licenses at 864 MHz, and is conducting field
tests with 1,000 Ferranti Phone Zone telephones.  Additionally,
Edwards plans field trials in New York City, on the street and in
the subway system.  He said that if the pocket telephones could
provide acceptable transmission quality in the noisy subway
environment, and on the street directly below the huge radio and TV
towers on top of the Empire State Building, he could be assured
that they would work anywhere.

BRITISH TELEPOINT NETWORKS LAUNCHED

     In the United Kingdom, two of the eventual four Telepoint
mobile phone services have started in London and, hesitantly, in
other cities too.  British Telecom was first with its Phonepoint
network, followed by Ferranti's Phonezone.   Mercury
Communications' Callpoint is due to appear within a few weeks, and
the fourth service from BYPS, a consortium of Philips, Barclays
Bank and Shell, will follow in early 1990.
      Handsets currently cost the equivalent of $310 or so, sign-on
fees are $40 and monthly subscriptions to a service cost $14 (it
varies only a little between the services) although costs are
expected to drop gradually during 1990.  The usage rates are 13
cents per minute local and 37 cents per minute national, about 20%
above coin phone rates.  They are considerably below cellular
rates, which are 60 cents per minute, local and national.

Telepoint Features

     So far there are just two Telepoint handsets, the Phonezone's
and one made by Shaye Communications being used by both Phonepoint
and Callpoint.  BYPS expects to offer CAI standard phones from day
one - the reason they cite for their later launch timetable.  Also
to offer handsets in 1990 is Obitel, a joint venture of Racal and
Plessey.
     Telepoint handsets operate at 864-868 MHz with 40 channels per
public base station although most base stations will initially
operate with 2-4 channels activated until traffic picks up.  The
CT2 technology uses FDMA digital transmission between handset and
base, which permits interference-free calls with high audio
quality.  The small size of the cells allows high spectrum
efficiency, since the 40 channels allotted to Telepoint will be
reused at each cell.  In dense urban areas, the cell size can be
reduced from the standard 200 meters, allowing more users per
square kilometer.  Features of the handset can include
national/international call barring, remote disablement of lost or
stolen handsets and self diagnostics on base stations.

Networks are Growing

     Both the live services have started small, with some 300 base
stations in London and one or two other areas at their launch,
though both have increased the base station population since then.
Phonepoint, for example, has raised its end 1989 forecast to 1500
base stations in operation.  However both services have promising
base station contracts.  Phonezone for instance has a contract to
place base stations in all London Underground (subway) stations -
62 in the central city area alone.  Post Offices have been signed
by Phonepoint and both have contracts with hotels, service areas,
airports, banks and restaurants.    Nevertheless, it seems to us
that in the race to be first, Telepoint may have been tempted into
launching prematurely.
     The eventual target for full saturation is for the user to
never be more than 500 meters from a Telepoint in urban areas or
ten minutes' drive on main roads. To achieve that would require
hundreds of thousands of sites across the UK - Phonepoint says that
agreements already in place give them potentially 30,000 or more.
Both services admit that users will be slow to come forward until
a critical mass of sites exists, but there is no concurrence on
what that level may be.  Projections for 1995 usage by Telepoint
operators and financial analysts have ranged from 800,000 to 6
million subscribers.
     Another major block to growth is the lack of standards - the
first three Telepoint services are incompatible.  A Common Air
Interface (CAI) will allow handsets to be used on more than one
service when it comes into existence in mid-1990, but users will
have to subscribe to both services, increasing the cost.
     The government license obliges all Telepoint services to
introduce roaming, though it could be two years away yet.  Then
subscribers to one service will be able to use another service's
base stations, presumably at slightly higher call charge rates than
usual.

PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENT OF U.K. TELEPOINT SYSTEM

   The following table is an estimate of the financials of a U.K.
Telepoint operator, neither the largest nor the smallest of the
four Telepoint operators.  An underlying assumption is that there
will be approximately two million Telepoint subscribers in the U.K.
by late 1995.
     Service revenues include registration fees, monthly subscriber
charges and usage fees, and expenses include sales/marketing costs,
customer service (including billing), system operation and
maintenance, network charges, G&A and depreciation.
