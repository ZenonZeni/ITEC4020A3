<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>A Game Plan For Meeting College Costs</STRONG></FONT><P>

Sending children to college can be a major financial burden for many parents.  Establishing a
sound
financial plan can be a key to easing that burden and allow your children the education they
deserve.
<P>
<STRONG>Putting a Foundation Beneath Your Children's Dreams</STRONG><BR>
All parents have big dreams for their children. They hope one day they'll grow up to become
someone
truly great - the President of the U.S., a doctor who finds a miracle cure, a concert
pianist. These
dreams can be obtained with the help of a college education. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Much Does College Cost?</STRONG><BR>
Most people look back on their college years with great fondness - and many look ahead to
their
children's education with some anxiety. With costs so high, how can I afford to send my kids
to college?
According to 1995-1996 College Board statistics, a college education currently averages about
$37,000 for a four-year degree at a public college, and over $79,000 at a four-year private
school.
Looking at the Ivy League? Four years of tuition, fees, room and board now costs about
$100,000 at
elite schools such as Harvard and Yale. And costs keep rising. The College Board says that
the
average annual increase in tuition at private universities during the 1980s was about 11%.
These
numbers can strike fear into the hearts of parents of college-bound children. Sure, the ever
rising costs
of college can be a challenge, but it is one that can be met. Early preparation can help make
it easier
for everyone concerned. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Much Will You Need To Save?</STRONG><BR>
If your child is age 1:<BR>
It will take a $434 invested each month for 17 years to pay for a college education at a
private
university.	
<P>
If your child is age 10:<BR>
It will take a $876 invested each month for 8 years to pay for a college education at a
private
university.<P>

<P>
<STRONG>Here Are Some Tips on Getting a Handle on College Funding:</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<STRONG>Pre-Pay Tuition</STRONG> - Some state universities have set up innovative programs
where college expenses
may be paid in installments over many years, prior to attending the school. This may be a
convenient
way to meet expenses, but it takes the choice of school away from your child. What if your
child does
not
want to attend the state university? This could pose a problem.
<P>
<STRONG>Borrowing</STRONG> - These days, most people borrow at least a portion of the money
needed to cover college
expenses. You may want your children to look for student loans with special lower rates and
repayment
terms for college. However, repaying a large loan 
for many years after graduation can be a burden for some recent graduates. Tapping into your
401(k)
plan may be an option, but you may want to take a loan rather than a withdrawal to avoid tax
consequences. Of course, a loan will impede the potential growth of your retirement nest egg.
<P>
<STRONG>Financial Aid</STRONG> - There are billions of dollars available each year in
scholarships, grants, and work study
programs. Financial aid to middle income families may be tough to come by, but with the
shrunken
college age population, some student-hungry universities are more willing to offer generous
financial
aid packages. It's certainly worth contacting your child's high school and prospective
college financial
aid office to see if you're eligible.
<P>
<STRONG>The Team Approach</STRONG> - With the seemingly overwhelming cost, it may be most
practical to finance
school through many sources such as your personal savings, student loans, financial aid, even a
part-time job
for your child. Once in school, your child might want to look into paid internships that
provide valuable
experience and help pay the bills. Every bit will help, but the bulk may still have to come
from money
you
put away over the years - so it's essential to make the most of your savings and investments.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The Key to College Funding</STRONG><BR>
Start saving now! There's no better time than the present to begin accumulating funds for
future college
costs. Below are some tips:
<P>
<UL>
<STRONG>Put time on your side</STRONG> - If your children are young, or you don't have
children
yet, you can put the power
of time to work for you. The sooner you start, the better, letting the wonder of compound
interest help
build a nice college fund. <P>
<STRONG>Pay yourself first</STRONG> - Systematically set aside a fixed amount at a regular
interval
that you can comfortably
afford. You may be able to have this done automatically through bank drafting and payroll
deduction.
Speak to your financial institution and payroll department to set up these convenient savings
methods.
<P>
<STRONG>Use tax advantages</STRONG> - You can try to maximize earnings and minimize taxes
through several
tax-advantaged strategies. Investing in tax-free municipal bonds or bond funds, setting up a
trust, and
making a gift under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act are three ways to possibly lower the tax
bite. Consult
your tax advisor and attorney regarding these approaches.
<P>
<STRONG>Don't put all your eggs in one basket</STRONG> - Diversification is a key to reducing
potential risk. Dividing your
money among different financial vehicles may help protect against loss and increase the
potential for
competitive returns. If your children are still in diapers and you have a long time horizon,
you may want
to consider financial products that may offer the potential for greater returns to complement
traditional
bank products.
<P>
<STRONG>The Financial Vehicles to Take Your Kids to College</STRONG><BR>
Before your child asks you for a spiffy new sports car to take to school, you may want to
take a look at
some financial vehicles. Permanent life insurance products, such as whole life and universal
life, offer
cash value accumulation in addition to their essential financial protection. Over the long
term, the cash
value accumulation may be significant enough to help fund a portion of college expenses.
Annuities
may also be an option. There are a variety of annuities designed to help build your nest egg.
Some
products offer the convenience of automatic bank drafting - making systematic monthly premium
payments easy (withdrawals from annuities prior to age <NOBR>59 1/2</NOBR> may be subject to
a
10% IRS penalty
tax).
