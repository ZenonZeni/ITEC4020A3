Multiple Source Wastewater Treatment
</H1>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>This comprehensive wastewater treatment 
system</B> works with all types of finishing operations as well as specialty manufacturing and industrial operations that involve etching and milling processes. 

<P>Depending on the scope of the application, local environmental regulations and specific customer requirements, the systems are engineered for either batch 
or continuous operation. They have between four and 10 modules, including modules for wastewater collection and segregation, chemical treatment, clarification, sludge thickening, pH adjustment, sand filtration, carbon filtration, flow monitoring and water recycling. 

<P>Systems fit in a minimum floor space, require minimum resources and function without the constant attention of an operator. 

<P>Wastewater from a variety of sources, including deionized water regeneration, electrocoat permeate and post rinse fluids can be accommodated.  The system is 
also compatible with common pretreatment chemicals such as deoxidizers, iron or zinc phosphate, pickling solutions and conditioning agents as well as chrome and 
non-chrome sealers. 

<P>Control systems are available to suit individual applications and can include PLCs with integral feedback and measurement or documentation capability.
