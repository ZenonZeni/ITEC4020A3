Free Trade Bill of Rights</B>

</A>










</H1><P>











<P><B>Free trade never existed.   Free trade is a myth that fuels political





















debate and drains the U.S. economy.  In order for there to be real free (and





















fair) trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules.
  During the past half-century, the United States has developed a set of
rules for factories and workers, establishing a high standard of living,
good environmental and occupational safety and health laws, minimum wages
and maximum hours of work.  We fought a devastating war to stop slavery.
 But all of our standards are being undermined by trading "freely" with nations





















that don't have a high regard for human rights, disregard the rights of children





















and scorn the rights of workers.</B>












<P><B>	For example, we can't have free trade with a nation that has slave
labor.  Or child labor.  Similarly, we can't have free trade with a nation
that discriminates against the importation of American products.  The General





















Agreement on Tariffs and Trade purports to be the international ground rules
for free trade, but it is nothing of the kind.  It not only allows child
labor, but actually prohibits nations from banning the importation of goods
made by 10 year olds. </B>












<P><B>	I have been called a protectionist for opposing unlimited free trade.
 We must protect the values that we have developed over the last fifty years
and if this is protectionism,  I wear that label with pride.  However, I
believe that we should trade with other nations, so long as the trade is
truly free.  In order to have real free trade we must have free workers,
not child laborers.  Henry Ford said that he paid his workers well so that
they could afford to buy his products. Similarly, we want foreign workers
to be paid well so that they can afford to purchase fine American products.





















 </B>












<P><B>	Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standard





















for other nations seeking to trade with the United States.  As the world's





















leading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,
using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playing





















field level.</B>












<P><B><I>	Article One</I>.   Democracy.   The right of the people to vote
in elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.
 [Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.]</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Two</I>.  Freedom of Speech and Assembly.   The right of
the people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed.  This
article includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compare
products in these advertisements.  [Many countries, including Germany, prohibit





















certain comparative ads.]</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Three</I>.  Prohibition of Child Labor.   Children under
the age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free from
coerced labor.  [There are two hundred million children under the age of
15 "employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil
and many other nations.  Many of these children are sold into slavery and
chained to machines.]</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Four</I>.  Prohibition of Slave Labor.   No person shall
be forced to work or sold into slavery.  Prison labor shall be permitted,





















however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.
 [China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners]</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Five</I>.  Trade Unions Protected.  Free and unfettered
trade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law.  All persons





















shall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not be





















retaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join or
to form a trade union.</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Six</I>.  Environmental Protection.  Emissions from factories





















and agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extent possible.





















 Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international standard,
but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards.  [Pesticides,
such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported on Mexican





















tomatoes.]</B>












<P><B><I>	Article Seven</I>.  Worker Safety and Health.  The safety and health
of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible.  The occupational





















safety and health laws of the United States shall be the international standard,





















but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards.</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Eight</I>.  Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours.  Factory and





















agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no event less
than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States.  [This means





















that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per hour or more,





















giving these workers the ability to buy American products.  Now workers in
Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour and cannot





















afford to buy the shoes that they produce.]</B>












<P><B>	No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours per
week.  [The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, while





















Germany and France have even shorter work weeks.] </B>












<P><B><I>	Article Nine</I>.  Barriers to Trade.  No nation shall discriminate





















against imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.
 [Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States.  Many nations





















have more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United States





















causing  tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.]</B>












<P><B>	<I>Article Ten</I>.  Illicit Trade Prohibited.  Nations shall not
trade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being used
in nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons.  [When an outlaw
nation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and other
nations have every right to ban trade with that country.  Currently, China
has been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan.  This





















provision would allow the United States to punish China with trade





















sanctions.]</B>












<P><B>	When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questions





















about slave labor, child labor and human rights.  Free trade only works if





















everyone plays by the same rules.</B>
