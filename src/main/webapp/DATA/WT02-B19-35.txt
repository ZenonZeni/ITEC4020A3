<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size = 4>A new treatment has recently appeared which showed
great promise in resolving a medical condition which afflicts millions,
in some cases producing life-threatening complications, and almost always
drastically altering quality of life.  And, as with so many other groundbreaking 
treatments, the promise has faded to a more evenly, and less exciting, distribution 
of effects that range from significant benefit with minimal side effects for a few
to maximal
side effects (death?) for the smallest proportion. The far majority of recipients
find initial success only to face eventual waning benefits and intolerable
consequences.<BR>
<BR>
This evolution from panacea to panic has taken considerable time to form
and has not yet fully developed. A combination of two prescription medications,
phentermine (trade names include Adipex, Ionamin, and Fastin) and fenfluramine
(available only as Pondimin) were combined in a study by Dr. Michael Weintraub,
now with the FDA. The study received much attention in the medical and lay
press since participants were followed for nearly four years, the study
was well designed (neither patients nor physicians knew who was getting
medication or placebo and the two groups were switched), and the weight
decrease was greater than had been reported through other means.<BR>
<BR>
Two aspects of the study escaped the attention of most readers and have
since become prophetic. One was the high &quot;dropout rate&quot; or number
of people who discontinued the program for whatever reason, including
side effects; second was the eventual weight regain following discontinuation
of medication. Together, these reality measures have led physicians and
their patients to the conclusion that these medications are not for everyone
and that those experiencing relative success may need to continue to take
the medications &quot;forever.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Were the medications to give people better control of their weight with
minimal side effects and at a reasonable cost, an argument could be made
for continuing them life-long much as an insulin-dependent diabetic must
continue medications &quot;forever.&quot; But now that people have had adequate
time to fairly evaluate long term effects, the flag-waving days have gone.<BR>
<BR>
Phentermine alone has never been very useful since most become tolerant
to its effects within weeks to months, meaning that it no longer seems to
work in suppressing appetite. It stands to reason that adding fenfluramine
to it would be unlikely to increase the active lifespan by much.  Even in Weintraub's
study, which incorporated regular exercise and a rational diet, people had
difficulty in dropping more than 35 lbs., resulting in an average
weight of 190-some lbs. at the end of the study.<BR>
<BR>
Two new developments, certain to muddy the waters, have been announced in
recent weeks. One is the release of a fenfluramine alternative, dex-fenfluramine
or Redux, which has been available in Europe for many years. It is hoped
that the new kid on the block will produce fewer neurologic (brain-related)
side effects than its cousin. Second was the untimely release of news reports
out of England (carried in France, Scotland, and... believe it... Singapore)
that a dozen deaths have been
documented in people taking some combination of the above three medications.<BR>
<BR>
Little else has been made public as of this writing. In many countries,
the medications are available without a prescription. Cause of death has
not been reported. In a best case scenario, the 12 deaths may be mere statistical coincidences
and the medications may come clean in the end. Even if the risk were 1 in
10 million, some one is no longer among the living as a result. To that
one, their risk of death was 100%.<BR>
<BR>
The question remains whether they are cost-effective over time. The &quot;new
and improved&quot; version, dex-fenfluramine, is more appropriately titled
&quot;new
and more expensive&quot; at $75 per week. For that amount of money, people
can
expect to shed an average of only 10% of their weight and gain it back as
soon as it is discontinued.<BR>
<BR>
Still, there is hope for the overweight. Treatment programs with a strong
behavioral component have helped people remain within 10 lbs. of their
lowest weight (in some cases hundreds of pounds below their lifetime max.)
for over five years as long as they continue to stay with the program. Such
a program, combined with conservative though rational and carefully
monitored use of medications, will continue to offer the greatest weight
loss results, with the lowest rate of adverse consequences, and the highest
rate of satisfaction. That may not sound as appealing as popping a pill
daily but, for now, comes closest to a &quot;cure.&quot; </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
