 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>My son was born with enlarged tonsils.  The doctors tell me that they are seen in some children.  He is 5 now and is otherwise healthy.  He has only had strep once, so that is not a problem.  He did have frequent inner ear infections the first 3 years of his life. I'm looking for an alternative treatment to reduce the tonsils, naturally, and some possible causes for the enlarged tonsils.  I have a hunch that the problem is caused by either an allergy or a nutritional deficiency, but I don't know which nutrient or allergen.  Thanks

 <b>Subject:</b> Warning: Colloidal Silver, EDTA and DMPS<br>
 <b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto:mercure@primenet.com">mercure@primenet.com</a><br>
 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>1. I have to tell you of a local health food store owner here in AZ and
his decline due to colloildal silver :
    A local health food store owner is seriously sick from colloidal
silver, disabled, and his wife says he may die unless he stops taking the silver and starts chelating it with N-acetylcysteine, Lipoic acid, Glutathione, Methionine and Taurine.
    He was great before starting the colloidal silver. After starting
to take C.S. , first his skin complexion turned to bluish. Next he became pale, and now is down with serious pneumonia and indigestion , all due to the darned colloidal silver poisoning him.
    IMHO, silver is a poisonous heavy metal, just like quicksilver,
mercury, hg, mercury causes poisoning called hydrargyria, and
silver causes argyria, which is somewhat similar chronic poisoning.
Silver binds to proteins and thiols, damaged liver, bone marrow,
kidneys, pancreas, nerves etc. Only chelating agents can recover
one from colloidal or any silver caused silver poisoning, argyria.

2. EDTA chelation is potentially very dangerous for those who 
have either mercury or lead poisoning. Studies by Biochem. Ph.D 
Boyd Haley in Ky U proved that mercury and EDTA combines to
100x more toxic that either alone, producing Alzheimer-like condition. Is it worth exchanging the arterial disease to Dementia ?

Instead, there are better alternatives to remove arterial plaque.
Those are for example :

a. Nutrients to reduce homocysteine levels, and that is achieved with fairly high dose Folic acid, N-acetylcysteine, B6 vitamin, perhaps methylcobalamin and molybdenum to accelerate
homocysteine change to methionine. Mercury poisoned have to
be aware of possible risk of increased mercury methylation, if
high doses of methylcobalamin are used. B12 may not be totally
necessary, folate, NAC  and b6 should do most of the trick.

b. Products to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream. Such are LIPASE enzyme ( do not take protease
in most cases, and neither amylase. Tyler Encaps and Infinity
have good products free of protease, lecithin and bile-acids
like Taurocholate and Ursodeoxycholate. Especiallu useful for
bloodstream cholesterol reduction are cholestyramine ion-exchange resins that wipe the cholesterol of the gut. Of course
low-fat/low-cholesterol diet is needed and choice of good oils,
like flax, primprose and olive oils, when any fats are needed.

c. To remove calcium from bloodstream, D-vitamin is a good
start. to encourage the transfer of calcium to bones instead out
of the bones. Fosforic acid drinks also pull calcium out, as well
as excess sugar consumption. Additionally Amalgam fillings cause
massive calcium dumping into the bloodstreat from the cells. 
Amalgams are one major origin for multitide of conditions.

3. For those who need heavy metal chelation, DMPS is NOT SAFE
for those with sulfa-intolerance or sulfa-allergy. I personally almost
died due to DMPS-IV and I had inherited sulfa-allergy, poor
sulfoxidation ( needed for DMPS metabolism ) , and low folate
status ( DMPS kills gut flora by inhibiting folate production, as it 
closely resembles sulfa-drugs DimerCaptoPropaneSulphonate )
Also, one MUST tolerance test before committing to DMPS. 
One, max oral 100 mg capsule ( Heyl GMBH, Germany ) and
1-2 weeks waiting whehter side-effects occur ( possible kidney and
pancreas damage for those who are sulfa-allergic, oral capsule
is not enough to do much damage, but IV's would be, so do not
take IV firts ). This is only for those who passed the pre-screening,
not having sulfa-allergy, poor sulfoxidation or poor folate status.

Better alternative is FDA approved oral DMSA  ( DimerCaptoSuccinate ) in low doses. DMPS is NOT FDA
approved, and it was invented in Russian in 1957 by a Sanitary
Institute Engineer. Then again, EDTA was invented by Nazi's
to allow their guards to survive the gassing of Jews and to 
survive Gas Warfare. DMPS was invented for the same reason
to help Russian solders in case there was Nerve Gas War.
DMSA was Chinese/US invention for the same reason in 60's.
DMSA is the safest and biochemically soundest of these.
DMPS is water-soluble analog of BAL, British Anti Lewisitem which
is Dimercaptopropanol, which backfired horribly ...

Best/Safest oral chelation alternatives are perhaps Glutathione,
N-acetylCysteine, Methione plus B6/Folate, perhaps Taurine,
Rutin/Quercetin and maybe Lipoic acid, but be careful with lipoate.
NAC must be taken with food, or it could think the mucus of the
stomach lining. NAC is great for mucusy lung conditions. It is
great for the liver as well as all these nutrients. Milk Thistle is also
limitedly useful, though not as good as there. Zinc, Selenium and
Molybdenum and certain organic acids accelerate the metal
chelations. One must replenish the good minerals with safe 
non-colloidal inorganic or organic minerals. Colloidals can be
very bad. Hype is not based on scientific knowledge. I guess
the dead doctors drank colloidals or something. I tried colloidals
and they were just waste of money and time.

If you suffer from mercury poisoning, search web and find excellent
homepages, like Jeff Clark's home page, I have personally
contributed to his home page, in relation to neutrophil research,
methylmercury research and especially chelation research.
http://www.teleport.com/~ctseng

I am personally yet too busy to complete my own home page, but
it is under work, and I consider writing a book about heavy metal
poisonings and chelation safety, as it seems that there is lots of
misconceptions in the field, and unsafe treatments. Chelations
and heavy metal poisonigs are much more complex issues than
most people think.

I hope this message was of some use. Please e-mail me with
questions.

Also, I am searching for true super-enzyme guru researcher, that
knows of the recombinant bacterial acid-stable enzymes, I dislike
any fungal originated products personally. Aspergillosis and
Candidiasis are no fun, why bother ...

 <b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto:kbamsey@mwec.com">kbamsey@mwec.com</a><br>
 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>  Last April, I was diagnosed with lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), and was told I had to have most of my right lung removed to remove the malignant tumor. At the time, I didn't know any better, so I had the surgery. The cancer had also spread to 2 or the 3 lymph nodes that were biopsied. My prognosis was not good, and I was told to start radiation theraphy, which I refused.
   I had just recently heard about Essiac, and felt led to try it instead. I began taking 2 oz./ three times a day, even while I was still in the hospital. Within one month, my blood-work was much improved, and by two months, all my tests, including cat-scans, xrays,etc, were all within normal limits. My oncologist doesn't know what to think! He said he believes in some alternative medicine, but doesn't he make a lot of money by using chemo, radiation, and other life-threatning forms of treatment??
  I continue to get frequent check-ups, but I believe in my heart that I am healed! Thanks to the Lord, and Essiac tea, in that order. I will continue to take Essiac from now on, at a lower dose, it just makes me feel better!
  No, I don't sell the tea, but I would recommend it to anyone with cancer. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain!

 <b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto:Sarglews@bconnex.net">Sarglews@bconnex.net</a><br>
 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>A brief history;  In 1985 I slept in a sleeping bag that had been dry cleaned with Perchlorethylene, a chemical.  Iunderstand it has been banned in a lot of states and provinces in Canada.  The fumes affected me and I was off work for over three onths.  Over theyears my breathing problems got worse.  I am on three inhalers now - bechloforte, atrovent and ventolin.  In 1992 I had my first asthma attack.  The doctors gave me prednisone without telling me that it would leach (suck) the calcium out of my bones, which it did.  As a result I have lost over FOUR inches in height, several of mybertebra fractured.  I keep getting lung infections and of course I was prescribed a lot of different antibiotics, finally between the prednisone and the antibiotics my stomach is in bad shape.  I am now limited to what I can eat (it might be yeast infection).  I went back to my previous family doctor and when I told him about the prednisone he just shook his head.  Right now I am taking 50,000 i.u. of Vit. "D" amd a naturalsubstance called "Bone-Up" from Jarrow Formulas, Los Angeles, as well as some other medication suggested by a naturapath.
What else can it do or take to remedy some of these problems?  Does anyone know personally of the effects of Perc poisoning?  Only in Canada eh?  Thank you.....

Why would they knock their profession when this is how they make their money? We women will not be used as guinea pigs for the medical profession anymore because we were lied to. I pray that you will search for the truth as it is coming to the forefront now. May God bless you and yours. We also have a group for children of mothers with implants. 

Very sincerely,

Glenda Bamsey

I am a patient, and not a doctor and in no way am offering any medical advice here;  but I and was diagnosed with a partly blocked artery that feed the back of my heart mussel.  WHAT A SHOCK!

Doctors later changed their diagnosis to Alzheimer's. Dad remained in a vegetative condition for twenty-one years before dying last year. It never seemed typical of Alzheimer's, he was only thirty-nine at the time. My brother's neurologists have put a lot of weight 
on my father's autopsy which took nine months to confirm Alzheimer's. They are saying my brother suffers from the familial kind. If anyone has any suggestions, I would respectfully consider all. I have researched some of the alternatives and he had his dental amalgams 
removed about three weeks ago. The doctors have just put him on the newest drug called "Aricept". I have seen some memory improvement but I don't know which to attribute that to. Any help is desperately needed. I don't want to visit my brother in a nursing facility for
twenty years. There must be an answer.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>Hi All, I have been reading and trying the healing technigues in the remarkable books, A Cure for all Diseases, and A Cure for all Cancers, by Hulda Regehr Clark.
  The books are selling as fast as they can be printed and come into the stores here in Houston. Filled with case histories, and specific ways to cure anything. The author claims any cancer, even terminal ones can be cured in 5 days. See the cancer book for info. Also the author claims all diseases are curable and have the same basic biochemical cause. Her research leads her to claim that all disease is a combination of certain internal parasites mixed with tonic chemicals. And she knows what parasites combine with what tonic chemicals to cause what disease. All the info is given to heal yourself, and also duplicate the authors research, also much info for healing professionals.
   I have read hundreds and hundreds of books on alternative healing. These books are the most well documented of any I have ever read. Whatever you need help with, check them out. There is also a book on curing Aids too.
    Happy Healing

Since I didn't understand why the people around me were all sick, I decided to look into Alternative medicine.  As I found out that Doctors could not get my friends well, but they were happy to take the MONEY! So anyway I found Tahitian Noni Juice.  You would not believe what has happened to the people around me. I wanted to become a distributor, but not until I Knew for sure what this stuff does.  My wife and I bought 8 cases and distributed it to people from (high BP, clogged arteries, acne, artritis, fatigue, depression, ETC...)  We found that this stuf is GREAT. We became distributors. I would like to give you info on this. Please, If you or somebody you know has been ill or unhealthy, contact me. I cannot speak enough about this! Your friend,  Tarry

If she has found a cure then she should set up a decent clinical trial and be able to reproduce the results using an independent orgn.
Im not saying it may not work but they need to back up there claims with proof not anecdotes they are inspirational but useless as far as validity.
Its no wonder that alt medicine gets a bad name from the conv Drs when they see claims like Hulda's doing the rounds.Its a shocker, and its about time that this industry applied a bit of scientific rigour  and standards to the industry or it will never get any credibility.
Which makes it harder on us the people toget conv Drs to listen.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>Hey, to all you doctors out there who want
to cure the world but have realized it ain't gonna happen...
...and to all you people out there who want
to REALLY get well...
...and not just pretend they can by taking a pill
for a while to control the symptoms...

Read the following and be reinforced:

Sickness Can Be a Blessing, but not a Pleasant One. . .
	
	The body oftentimes gets sick in order to get better. This is the bodies way of
correcting a toxic situation---either expelling it through the lungs and nasal passages, as in
colds and congestion, or by burning it up in fevers and flu's.
	In other words, sickness can be a blessing, especially if it is a part of a detoxifying
process that accompanies an improvement in diet. For as diet improves the body, it will clean
itself up and expel toxins as part of the natural healing progression towards health.  Long term
health cannot be achieved through medication alone.  It can be attained as a part of a slow,
natural process by the body, supported by a high-fiber, low-fat diet.
	This will not always be a neat and pleasant process, and for one who is seeking long-
term healing, it should be known ahead of time that  THE ROAD TO TRUE HEALTH MAY
BE DISCOURAGING AT TIMES AS THE BODY CLEANS ITSELF UP BY GETTING
SICK TO DO SO.  This is also why, for the most part, colds an flu's should be left to run
their course and not be suppressed with drugs, if possible.  Suppressing minor sicknesses in
the short run leads to accumulations and greater body  toxicity in the long run.  Colds turn into
flu's,  flu's turn into sinus, bronchial and lung problems, then asthma, allergies, pneumonia or
cancer. 
	The prescription, as far as natural healing is concerned, would be to rest, drink lots of
water and eat as lightly as possible, preferably soups, steamed vegies, some grains and a little
protein, if the body is able to take sustenance---the reason for a light diet being to use as little
energy as possible for digestion so as to be able to use it for immune system responses.
	Another understanding of sickness may be gleaned from animals.  For if you observe
them when they get sick, they simply sit in one place or another, drink water occasionally and
wait until their sickness leaves and hunger returns.  They seem to  instinctively know that the
body is the doctor.  Of course, if the sickness is life-threatening, or too painful, then
medication may be needed or even desirable.  But until sickness is chronic and reaches that
point, natural healing would treat it by improvement in diet and life style.
	So, what is being said here is that the next time illness catches up with you, consider
your body is still working, and is able to muster the energy to expel the problem or at least
make the effort.  And, if you have really changed to a more natural diet, think of it as a house
cleaning, because when it is over you should be that much closer to being less toxic, and more
healthy.
	Indeed, if we didn't get small sicknesses periodically, we would most likely never
make it to the age of 21.  And furthermore, if medical science ever does come up with a so-
called miracle drug (like interferon) that will supposedly eliminate (suppress) the common cold
process, then the human race will be doomed to even greater sickness as there will be no
escape from the gradual building up of toxic waste inside each individual. This over-
prescribing of drugs and over-the-counter medications, in my opinion, one of the major
reasons there is probably more disease and sickness than ever before in history, as people
continually seek immediate remedies for long-term life style problems.
	Thus, if you really want to get truly healthy in the long run, start with what you are
eating. Supply your body with the nutrients to give the immune system what it needs and the
rest will take care of itself.  THE BODY IS THE DOCTOR, BUT IT CAN'T HEAL
ITSELF WITHOUT THE ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE TASK,
namely the minerals and vitamins found in a high fibre, low fat diet.
	Try and remember that the road to healing will most likely not be a "rosy path," but a
retracing back through many past illnesses that were not handled naturally in the first place. 
This will make the road to wellness appear as a series of hills and valleys on up to optimum
health.  So buckle up and be prepared for the ride.  If you have improved your diet, the ruts
could be a blessing... in a not so pleasant disguise. Bon appetit...www.holbaleval.com

We of course are all entitled to our own opinion, however please don't try to dissuade people that diet doesn't cure cancer or any other diseases. There are plenty of double-blind studies out there that prove this, you just need to look for them. Also just because there haven't been studies done that suit you on diet doesn't mean it doesn't work. I myself, doing what Dr. Jonas spoke about, reversed severe reumatoid arthritis. The body does heal itself, no pill in the world has ever healed anyone. The only reason there is uncontrolled cell reproduction is it has an environment that encourages growth. Try it before denigrating it.

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>Al says try stoping a cancer from spreading with nutrition is not possible. Well Al, in late term cases you would be right most of the time. Because when it's too late, it's
really to late, the body is too sick too weak.
However, you can find numerous books on the shelves of people who have had all types of cancers reversed who took the alternative medicine route from the early stages.  
This is not fantasy but fact reported by hundreds of people
in many health biographies written to tell people that yes
it is possible to reverse almost any toxic condition in the
body through diligent nutritional practices over a long period of time.  Cancers can be shrunk.  The body can attack
cancer and encapsulate it, or even destroy it.  There are numerous incidences of this taking place all the time.
How would you explain them.  In most cases you will find the
person has made a complete life style change, and attacked his cancer or any disease from all natural healing angles.
If you call this just sitting back as compared to taking a pill, or having a surgery you have a different interpretation of sitting back. 
Wholistic and alternative approaches to healing are often long and arduous, and demand complete devotion to the task at hand for several weeks to months to years...
At the least doctors and natural healing practitioners should work together...
At the foundation of all long term healing is wholistic healing involving changes to life styles and eating patterns that will prevent and heal long term accumulations of toxins
and or body chemistries that are deficient and out of balance.  Unable to supply the immune system with what it needs to fight disease in the first place.
So what if you remove the cancer but don't remove or correct the source. In a few years its back in most cases. End of story...the bitter end.

i don't know how old you are,
but it would be a good idea to try taking kelp tablets.
a couple times a day...
kelp contains a high amount of iodine which is usually the
main cuprit behind low thyroid..
it is also high in calcium and potassium and iron
all of which are also helpful...
and i have nothing to do with Norwegian Kelp...
its just the only non salt kelp

however without proper diet...salt or no salt....it
ain't gonna matter...comprende...jose...

eat alot of green things, not worms,....and carrots are very good.

for a complete evaluation...check out my web site www.holbaleval.com

its a crap shoot without data about a person to make decisions..

but as to the kelp...it will either help you...or do nothing...
give it about a week...

and you must be eating regular meals, high fibre low fat...

thats all for now

unless i hear from you..

god bless,

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>I have suffered with depression and anxiety for 10 years. Have been taking prozac and buspar which make me feel fatigued and achy. I am very curious about blood and hair testing and its accuracy. Wondering if alternative medicine is worth trying. Are we really allergic to foods and can this cause depression?

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>ey nokie,...perhaps you are chemically imbalanced
since this has been going on for 10 years...
...hair analysis done correctly, and the people undertaking
it know hair serves an excretory purpose and the mineral
found are in proportion to those excreted...or excesses.
...reading hair content can tell you about excessive minerals...but overall the indications are not representitive of the the mineral balance of the body except as to what the body is kicking out...this is where interpretation usually falls apart...however even learning about excesses can lead to further learning...

yes allergies to corn, wheat,peanut butter and many other
things can cause depression...usually the thing we eat the most is the culprit...try eliminating that and see what happens....then the next thing we simply can't get by without....

...have you been tested for low blood sugar?
...low blood sugar can cause depression?
do you eat regularly?
blood sugar levels that go up and down caues mood changes.

you should get yourself on a good diet...and then see...
you may need to take medications...
but you shoud also try and takes breaks from medications,
or half the dose from time to time to see how your doing...

I have a web site a www.holbaleval.com
its an alternative medicine examination...

included is a pH test...that is little know about...
i'd like to see yours...
other then that i would eat regular meals,
exercise, have a goal to shoot for in life...if
you don't have one...and try and deal with the depression
with any medication you need...you should try to keep at a
minimun...as these drugs will have a long term effect in most cases...kidneys, brain...but you can forstall with good
diet...

chemically imbalaned depression is  tough...i know...
you just got to deal with it as best you can...
its like a heavy cross...

sounds like your dealing with it...

you might try Vitamin B complex start with 50mg 2xs/day
between meals...good for brain and stress...
actually you should just start with vitamin B1 at 50
and start from there...

and this goes for the rest of you depressives...

I believe a nurse suggested this treatment to him. Melaleuca is another name for Australian tea tree oil and can be found at your health food store. I wish I had more details but this is about it. I have used the oil for less serious symptoms (fungus on a toe nail, a skin injury, etc.)and found it to work well. Maybe someone else could add to this. Best of luck to you and your mother.Let us know how she is doing and what, if any alternatives she used. - Diane

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>     The article in Issue #11 on Anxiety & Depression is of great interest to me. Last week, I suffered an anxiety attack for the first time in my life. My husband suspected that I had one, and I looked up the symptoms on the internet... sure enough. I am puzzled, however, by the fact that all my symptoms were physiological. I am not suffering from depression or fears/phobias... I was not even feeling stressed when the first attack struck (I ended up having 5 over the course of the day.) 
     I am also wondering about the correlation of hormones in conjunction with a slight brain chemical imbalance, as I began my period on the day after these attacks. My worst and most recurring symptom is the feeling of being in a "different dimension," which is brief, but disturbing. I am thinking that this imbalance, coupled with a normal premenstrual hormone imbalance might have triggered my attacks.
     Since I cannot afford to fly to Colorado (where Dr. Whitcomb is) I am wonder how I might find a similar doctor here in So. Calif. I'm sure there are lots of them around here... just don't know what to look for.
     Please contact me if you know of a good doctor in my area, or you have info regarding these symptoms. Thanks so much!

Of course I have tried several measures including seeing dermatologists, using prescribed antibiotics (external and internal), changing eating habits, exercise, drinking liters of water a day, over-the-counter products, and birth control.  I am an adult now.  This is ridiculous!  I'm beginning to think the only way my skin will improve is through cosmetic surgery.  This is not the way I want to go.
	My skin is often a combination of oily, flaky, and dry.  Blemishes and whiteheads are frequent.  Fortunately blackheads are no problem.  Cosmetic products I use are designed for my skin type (Almay, Neutrogenia, Clinique, etc.)  I have given treatments and products a decent chance to work, usually several weeks.  My efforts are getting me nowhere.  Are there any suggestions as to what I can do, change, or try?  I would be grateful for any advice.

As a result I fill up with bowel and air and can get pretty sick and uncomfortable.  Nothing moves through me and I have to do an NG tube to get things started again.

I'm wondering if diet plays a part (haven't discovered anthing myself except to stay away from gassy foods), or other heaalings (tried acupuncture and currently doing hands on healing/cranial sacral).

 <b>Message Body</b>:<br>I have heard the claims of many in the alt industry claiming cures and the proof is in the pudding dr jonas.My wife currently has ovarian cancer and we have tried the alt way only, at great expense, and for no direct result.It has cured her headaches,it has brought her back to her ideal weight,it has improved her cholesterol, but it hasnt stopped her cancer.
We have been on a strict diet prtiken\gerson type,iv vit c
heaps of   antioxidants,pycnogenol,meditation,wheatgass,organic juices and more for over a year.And for no result.We have not had any conventional treatment as yet.The cancer has been found very early as it was found accidently.
You should know that cancer does 4 things that make it a mongrel.1 it multiplies 2 it invades 3 it attracts blood vessels for a food source 4 it moves to different sites.This is why the conventional drs cant fix it most times.Its also why alt treatments dont work.The immune system cant identify the tumour from normal because they are our own cells .There are few foods that are proven to halt and reverse cancers.
There are many people that claim success but many can be explained.
I do believe that there are cures out there but there are an awful lot of people in this industry just there to make money from desperate people.

I also,have no doubt that the body does heal itself but I get sick of people making broad generalisations about cures and in particular cancers.We now know that many different cancers have different triggers : melanoma the sun,cervical a virus,colon diet,,breast hormonal, so come on stop with the simplistic solutions for complex problems.

If anyone knows of randomised double blind studies that have been successful please let me know.I contacted the gerson institute that have been around for decades and they could not furnish me with any proof that their treatment was superior than any others.
There are many many clinics that have been around for ages if they had the answer people would be flocking to their door as well as conv drs and chemical companies.

...listen Al, it is not easy to cure cancer...i have not given you a simplistic answer...i told you indeed it is much harder to cure with natural means over time then to have surgery if possible, or radiation or whatever medically...
...the art or practice of medicine is just that...an art...individualised for each particular case...all you can do is try...
their are no guarantees...if one thing doesn't work you try another...
depends on extent and damage already done, persons health at the time and overall strength, age, enviorment, etc...
...the best you can do is try and detoxify and get on a good diet from a natural point of view...
...in places where I have visited and worked it usually takes from four to 12 weeks to turn a severe illness around...and that is with 24hr a day intensive care with complete rest, colonics, and supplementation...
...if it was me...I would slowly over a period of a week work myself into a fasting state...water only...4oz of distilled every hour for 8 hrs a day...after the third day your hunger should subside...after which i would wait untill my hunger returned, which should be between the 7 and 21 day...at which point i would begin eating again...first soups, and fruit and steamed vegies gradually working myself back into regular eating habits...
...fasting has always been a way to heal...as done properly it will help the body rebalance itself and focus on the problems at hand....
...of course this all depends on the persons age, and overall health to begin with...as some are just to weak to do this...
...another type of semi-fast is a fresh carrot juice program,  where you would drink 2-4oz of carrot juice every couple of hours for from 7-21 days...or a grape juice fast...
...Al there is no simple cure...and any healing practitioner who would say so is a fraud...
...however there are many ways to skin a cat...the right way for your wife is impossible to predict...it is all individualized..

...i tell u what Al...go to the pharmacy, get some pH tape...take a pH reading at 2pm on two seperate days of saliva and urine...making sure she has eaten at least one meal on those days prior and had nothing to eat an hour before the test...then send me the results, along with her age, blood pressure, height and weight and I'll see what i can do to help guide you...


...and stop poo pooing all over alternative healing people...of which there are many crackpots with simplistic answers, just as there are many doctors with the same kind of hit and miss remedies...

...Al, if its too late...its too late...once your that sick it is usually very difficult to turn around, but not impossible...it varies from case to case...all you can do is try...which is exactly what you have been doing...and i can feel your frustration...but don't blame the doctors...they are not the ones who are sick...they can only try to help with no guarantees...the ones that do are quacks...and there are plenty of those on both sides of the isle...ok

Dont we get tetchy when challenged.Its easy for people to say it works(cancer treatments) when they are not the ones with their life in the balance.You see I have a problem with your logic. I outlined in a previous post why cancer is a mongrel.The immune system cant recognise that a tumour is bad for the host as it is the hosts cells.So it doesnt matter how stong your immune system is its not going to enter the fight because it cant see anyone to fight.
I cant find any evidence of food reversing any tumours apart from anecdotal.
Its also fine to say if one thing doesnt work try another.But your not the one swallowing 5 plus juices a day taking tablets all the time going for injections walking meditating preparing special meals buying organic produce from  special shops.There is only so much u can keep doing in a day and then after all that work u get no results.ITS EASY FOR U TO SAY JUST MOVE ONTO THE NEXT THING. 
You dont have the tumour growing inside U. And time is running out.
Thats why I have criticised alt medicine.The people affected with this lousy disease should not have to wade thru the BS spending their ever diminishing resources trying to find something to help them.
In that sense it is  ironic that people turn to alt medicine because they are unhappy with conv med yet alt med is doing exactly the same just in a different dress.

This post is not meant to imply that all alt medicine is rubbish as it is not.BUT ther are few regulations on how it is practised and it is just left to the market place to decide and the market can not do that it is driven by self interest only.
