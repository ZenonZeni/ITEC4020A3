The Springfield AMI is a private, non-profit organization dedicated to serving the needs of persons with serious mental illness/brain disorders and their families.  We are affiliated with the Missouri Coalition of the Mentally Ill (MOCAMI) and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI).
<p>
Mental illness is as much a biological disorder of the brain, as diabetes is a biological disorder of the pancreas.  It is no one's fault and like diabetes it can be treated and controlled with medication and therapy.
<p>
Through self-help support and education we prepare persons with brain disorders and their families to cope with the tragedy that is mental illness.  Through self empowerment, we help families become effective advocates fir ther afflicted loved one.  As a collective voice, we are a strong force for positive change in the mental health system.
