<B>Reporting on Iraqi connections in Jordan proves risky business</B><BR>

Salameh Ne'mat, the Amman correspondent for London's <CITE>Al-Hayat</cite> 
newspaper, was arrested on Oct. 3 and spent three days in jail after he was refused 
bail. Ne'mat is accused of violating two articles of Jordan's Press and Publications 
Law: publishing an article that is harmful to national unity and writing an article 
without consideration to objectivity, fairness and accuracy.<BR>
<BR>
The charges against Ne'mat stem from a controversial article he wrote for <CITE>Al-Hayat</CITE>
 on Sept. 20 in which he alleged that 42 Jordanian businessmen, journalists and officials 
were on the Iraqi government's payroll. The article, which did not name the 42 individuals, 
cited unnamed Jordanian officials as saying that the government is investigating the extent of Iraqi influence in media and business circles. <CITE>Al-Hayat</CITE>
 is standing behind the accuracy of the story. <p>

King Hussein, who supported the Iraqi regime during the Persian Gulf war and its aftermath, 
has distanced himself from Saddam Hussein since the August defection of two of Saddam's 
sons-in-law to Jordan.<BR>
<BR>
On Oct. 22, Jihad al-Khazen, the editor in chief of <CITE>Al-Hayat</CITE>,
was also named in the case. The trial is scheduled to begin in November. --<CITE>Avner Gidron</CITE>

<B>Journalist killed as rivals battle to control the press in Kashmir</B><BR>

Mushtaq Ali, a photographer for Agence France-Presse and camera operator for Asian 
News International, was fatally injured on Sept. 7, when a parcel bomb addressed 
to Yusuf Jameel, Srinagar correspondent for the BBC and Reuters, exploded in his 
hands. Jameel and Habibullah Naqash, a photographer for <CITE>Asian Age</cite> 
and United News of India, sustained minor injuries in the explosion, and Jameel's 
office was damaged extensively. <BR>
<BR>
No one claimed responsibility for the bomb. Jameel's coverage of the Kashmir conflict 
has often drawn criticism from both militant groups and the Indian government.<BR>
<BR>
The attack was condemned by CPJ, State Governor K.V. Krishna Rao, and the separatist 
All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC), which called a three-day general strike in 
the Kashmir Valley in protest.<BR>
<BR>
Kashmiri journalists went on strike again on Sept. 20, after a split in a leading 
militant group, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, left the local press subject 
to conflicting ultimatums from the rival factions.<CITE></cite> 
The strike was called off on Sept. 28, after APHC leaders successfully mediated between 
the two factions and the local press community. <BR>
<BR>
While the second strike was under way, government pressure on journalists continued 
as well. On Sept. 26, Border Security Force troops detained Ashraf Shaban, editor 
in chief of the Urdu daily <CITE>Al-Safa</CITE>
, for nine hours, and according to press accounts, accused him of meeting with militants 
on a regular basis. Shaban's father, former <CITE>Al-Safa</CITE>
 editor Mohammad Shaban Vakil, was slain by gunmen in April 1991, in an as-yet unresolved 
case. <BR>
<BR>
Vakil's death and previous attacks on Yusuf Jameel are documented in CPJ's report 
<CITE>On a Razor's Edge: Local Journalists Targeted by Warring Parties in Kashmir.</cite>

<B>Detention, harassment still threaten Cuban journalists </B><BR>

In November, 19 freedom of expression organizations, led by CPJ, issued a joint statement 
expressing concern over the recent wave of detentions and harassment of independent 
journalists in Cuba.<BR>
<BR>
In retaliation for a story about safety hazards at a nuclear power plant, state security 
officials detained reporter Olance Nogueras Roce four times in two weeks. They gave 
Nogueras, who writes for the Bureau of Independent Press of Cuba (BPIC), the choice between imprisonment or exile and warned him against continuing to work for BPIC.<BR>
<BR>
Nogueras was released from his last detention on Oct. 31, but as of this writing remains 
under house arrest and is forbidden from traveling to Havana, where the BPIC's offices 
are located. He has rejected exile to gain his freedom and faces rearrest.<BR>
<BR>
 To date, Cuban officials have accused Nogueras of "dangerousness," "usurping the 
role of a journalist," and "spreading false news that could endanger international 
peace." His family has been threatened against making statements to the BPIC about 
his fate, and the BPIC Havana offices remain under surveillance.<BR>
<BR>
BPIC was founded in September by formerly imprisoned journalist Yndamiro Restano, 
who was released in June 1995 after a protest campaign led by CPJ and other international 
press freedom and human rights groups. --<CITE>Ana Arana<BR>

<B>U.S. publisher may face criminal charges in Cambodia</B><BR>

Cambodia's two co-prime ministers, Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, have lodged 
a criminal complaint against the <CITE>Phnom Penh Post</CITE>,
a highly regarded English-language weekly. The complaint accuses the paper of disinformation, 
incitement and creating political instability.<BR>
<BR>
The claims stem from an article by Nate Thayer in the paper's March 24-April 6 issue, 
which described security measures taken by the two prime ministers to prevent a coup 
from occurring while they attended an aid meeting in Paris. The publisher, Michael 
Hayes, a U.S. citizen, faces up to nine years in prison and heavy fines if he is convicted 
on charges of disinformation under Article 62 of the criminal code, a holdover from 
the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). <BR>
<BR>
The government has already relied on the criminal code to muzzle several Khmer-language 
newspapers. On Oct. 6, for instance, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction of 
Chan Rotana, editor of <CITE>Samleng Yuvachun Khmer</CITE>
 (Voice of Khmer Youth). Chan had been sentenced on Feb. 27 to one year in prison 
and fined 5 million riels (US$2,058) for printing an article that accused Ranariddh 
of naively following Hun Sen's dictates. In a highly irregular move, the appeals 
court approved a government request to change the charge against Chan from disinformation to 
defamation shortly after the hearing began. But even though he was convicted of a 
lesser offense, the court retained the sentence imposed in February--a move of dubious 
legality, which Chan plans to contest before the Supreme Court. --<CITE>Vikram Parekh<BR>

<B>Brazilian police and city officials suspects in journalist murders</B><BR>

Four journalists have been killed in Brazil since March 1995. Evidence in all the 
cases suggests that they were killed as a result of the stories they were either 
investigating or had already published on local corruption. <BR>
<BR>
A policeman pulled the trigger on Marcos Borges Ribeiro, owner of the magazine <CITE>O Independente</CITE>
, who was shot four times at point-blank range in his home on May 1. His wife said 
that Borges had received death threats after his paper reported on alleged human 
rights abuses by the local police and other city officials.<BR>
<BR>
The police are also suspects in the Aug. 29 murder of Reinaldo Coutinho da Silva, 
owner of the weekly <CITE>Cachoeiras Jornal</CITE>
 in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Unidentified assassins intercepted the journalist's 
car and pumped 14 shots at close range. His paper had linked members of the police 
force with corruption. At the time of his death, he had also been investigating a 
local politician's role in an environmental scandal. --<CITE>Ana Arana<BR>

<B>UNESCO meeting in Yemen to focus on Arab media</B><br>
In January 1996, journalists from all over the Arab world will gather in Sana'a, Yemen, 
for UNESCO's Seminar on Promoting Independent and Pluralistic Arab Media. <BR>
<BR>
The conference is taking place at a time of crisis for Arab journalists. In Algeria, 
the media is experiencing an unprecedented existential threat. Fifty journalists 
and dozens of other media workers have been hunted down and killed by religious extremists. In Egypt, Tunisia and the Palestinian National Authority, journalists are under 
assault by governments that use the threat of Muslim fundamentalism as an excuse 
for cracking down on all critical reporting. And in much of the Arab world, hereditary 
regimes and secular dictatorships permit no independent media whatsoever. <BR>
<BR>
Even journalists in countries that have made significant strides towards expanding 
press freedom, such as Jordan and Yemen, still suffer from arbitrary abuse of power 
by officials who cling to their authoritarian roots. Lebanon continues to boast the 
region's only pluralistic broadcast media, but both print and broadcast journalists there 
must work under the watchful eye of big brother Syria.<BR>
<BR>
The Yemen conference will be the fourth in a series of biannual meetings on regional 
media. Previous ones have been held in Namibia, Kazakhstan and Chile. Participants 
at the Sana'a gathering will assess the independence of the media in the region, 
focusing on topics such as censorship, self-censorship, public-service media, press law, 
media training, women in the Arab media and press freedom monitoring. <BR>
<BR>
It is unrealistic to expect that any conference could even begin to address all the 
difficulties facing the Arab media. But it is reasonable to hope that independent 
Arab journalists attending the seminar will gain strength to continue fighting for 
their rights when they meet like-minded colleagues from other countries. And the presence 
of CPJ and other international press freedom groups will remind them and their governments 
that the world is watching. --<CITE>Avner Gidron<BR>

<B>CPJ secures release of ex-pat journalist in The Gambia</B><br>
In an October rally, Gambian leader Captain Yahya Jammeh accused journalists of sowing 
confusion in the country in the name of human rights and selling newspapers merely 
to profit from sensational stories.<BR>
<BR>
Two reporters from neighboring Sierra Leone--which has the highest recorded incidence 
of press freedom abuse in sub-Saharan Africa this year--learned the hard way that 
their expatriate status could not protect them against Jammeh's wrath. On Oct. 12, 
Chernor Ojukwu Sesay, who had fled to The Gambia in April, was deported back home after 
being held incommunicado for two days. His expulsion stemmed from two stories he 
published in Banjul's independent <CITE>Daily Observer</CITE>
 in which he reported on a police beating of two Sierra Leonean nationals. When Sesay 
was returned to Freetown, Sierra Leonean police arrested him and held him in the 
Criminal Investigations Division (CID) headquarters for six days. No official reason 
was given for his arrest, but CPJ had reason to believe it was due to his work for the 
<CITE>Observer.</CITE>
<BR>
<BR>
In addition to sending protest letters to the governments of both countries, CPJ called 
the head of the CID and--in coalition with the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists--secured 
Sesay's release on bond and without charge in less than 24 hours.<BR>
<BR>
CPJ also worked on behalf of Ernest Brima, a reporter for the independent Gambian 
newspaper <CITE>The Point</CITE>
. Brima was detained for four days in March for his work on an article about prison 
riots, for which his paper was charged with sedition. In October, soon after the 
sedition charges were dropped, Brima was pursued by immigration officials and was 
forced into hiding for a week to avoid deportation. He managed to escape to a neighboring country 
and, after a collective international effort, was granted a visa to a safe third 
country. CPJ is currently facilitating his application for asylum.<BR>
<BR>
In both cases, Gambia violated not only international guarantees of press freedom, 
but U.N. protections against <CITE>nonrefoulement--</CITE>
the forcible return of people to a country when they have a well-founded fear of 
persecution. The country also violated the terms governing freedom of movement agreed 
to by members of the Economic Community of West African States. --<CITE>Azeen Salimi</CITE>
