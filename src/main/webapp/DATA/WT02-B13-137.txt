Report to Readers<p>
<p>
Migration News began in February, 1994 as a six-page, 4,000 word review of
significant immigration developments produced for the 50 UC faculty and
graduate students affiliated with the Center for German and European Studies in
Comparative Immigration and Integration Program (CIIP).  Today, Migration News
has expanded to a four-part, 12,000-word monthly review of immigration and
integration developments in North America, Europe, and Asia .  It is
distributed to 425 subscribers monthly--350 via email--and has over 1,000
readers.  <p>
<p>
According to 200 responses to an October 1994 survey, 82 percent of the
subscribers read over half of each issue of Migration News, and 26 percent read
all of the stories.  Most readers spend 30 to 60 minutes with each issue,
although 1 in 6 readers reports spending more than 60 minutes per issue.  Over
70 percent of subscribers report that other people read their Migration News,
giving each issue an average of almost three readers each.<p>
<p>
Most readers placed highest priority on stories about immigration developments
in their own region, e.g., North Americans were most interested in North
American stories.<p>
<p>
Migration News is based on computers:  newspapers and magazines in four
computer bases are searched monthly, and then students prepare draft stories of
developments that are reported by two or more sources.  The managing editor
edits these drafts.  In addition, Migration News includes occasional original
items, such as conference reports, and reviews of current resource materials.
<p>
<p>
We encourage all readers who can to take Migration News via email; beginning in
1995, we may have to charge for the paper version that is mailed.<p>

SOS Dominates California Campaign</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The "Save Our State'' Initiative--Proposition 187--figured prominently in
California political campaigns in October, and forced many state and national
politicians to take a stand on how to deal with illegal immigration.  Virtually
every major newspaper included an average two stories daily on SOS and illegal
immigration.  There were estimated to be 4 million illegal aliens in the US in
October 1994, including 1.7 million in California.<p>
<p>
If approved by voters on November 8, 1994, SOS would amend the California
constitution to provide that no person "shall receive any public social
services to which he or she may otherwise be entitled until the legal status of
that person has been verified."  This means that all persons seeking public
services such as public education, including higher education, and health care,
except for emergency health care, must prove that they are legal US residents.
Schools and hospitals would have to determine the legal status of clients if
they expect the state to reimburse them for services provided.  If
publicly-funded service providers suspect that a person requesting services is
an illegal alien, they are required to report that person to the Attorney
General of California and to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.<p>
<p>
In addition, SOS makes it a felony to manufacture, distribute, sell or use
false citizenship documents, and requires police to report arrests of illegal
aliens to the INS.  <p>
<p>
Polls suggest that support for the initiative is declining.  A Field Poll
released October 27 indicated that Proposition 187 was supported by 53 percent
of the registered voters and opposed by 39 percent, with 8 percent undecided.
Many political analysts believe that Proposition 187 will still pass, but not
by the landslide margin predicted a few months ago.  <p>
<p>
SOS had a 37 point lead in July, and a 26 point lead in September, so the 14
percent lead represents a much closer vote than anticipated by SOS backers.
SOS supporters have done relatively little campaigning: "debates" on SOS often
featured only opponents of the measure.  SOS supporters noted that they do not
always participate in forums because they do not want their spokespeople in
"combative situations."  Newspaper reporters say that the pro-Prop. 187
organization has been wary of contacts with the media.  SOS supporters raised
less than $500,000, versus $1.4 million by SOS opponents.<p>
<p>
 Politicians take stands<p>
SOS is seen by both sides as a watershed issue in which California may indicate
the mood of the US.  California played a similar role in 1978, when Proposition
13 signaled unhappiness with high taxes, and helped to set the stage for the
Reagan tax cuts.  In 1990, California voters once again signaled their
discomfort with environmental protections threatening jobs by rejecting
Proposition 65 or Big Green, which would have incorporated environmental
protections into the state's constitution.<p>
<p>
The two major candidates for governor have lined up on opposite sides of SOS:
incumbent Republican Wilson supports it, while challenger Democrat Brown
opposes it.  In fact, Wilson has identified himself so closely with Prop 187
that some political observers speculate that his campaign may falter if support
for Prop. 187 continues to decline, especially after Wilson on October 26
called for an "identity card" that would have to be shown to obtain a job or
public services.  <p>
<p>
On October 21, 1994, President Clinton announced his opposition to SOS, calling
it an "unconstitutional" effort to reduce illegal immigration.  Instead, he
reminded Americans that he has been working hard to strengthen the Border
Patrol, which launched Operation Gatekeeper on October 1 in San Diego (see
below), and that the Administration has taken steps to reimburse states for the
costs they incur to imprison criminal aliens.  Clinton criticized Wilson as a
politician who worked in 1985 to ensure that farm employers had easy access to
Mexican workers, and who is now being hypocritical by arguing that the federal
government is responsible for illegal immigration and California's fiscal
problems.<p>
<p>
Democratic incumbent US Senator Diane Feinstein on October 21 announced her
opposition to SOS, citing reasons similar to Clinton's--denying public
education could "throw 400,000" youngsters into the streets, where they might
be recruited into gangs and crime.  Feinstein said that her alternative--2,100
more Border Patrol agents, financed by a $1 per person border crossing fee--and
a tamper-proof work permit were better solutions to illegal immigration.
Feinstein has also called for new penalties on alien smugglers. <p>
<p>
Republican challenger Michael Huffington on October 20 endorsed SOS, saying
that its passage would "send a signal" to Washington that Californians were
"fed up" with the federal government's failure to control illegal immigration.
He also advocated a constitutional amendment that would end the US practice of
making the children of illegal alien parents born in the US automatically US
citizens.  <p>
<p>
On October 27, Huffington confirmed he employed for five years a nanny who was
an illegal alien, and that he had not paid all of the required Social Security
taxes on the nanny's wages.  Feinstein immediately attacked Huffington's
"hypocrisy" on the illegal immigration issue, and several commentators
predicted that Huffington's illegal alien nanny doomed his campaign.<p>
<p>
[On October 6, 1994, Congress amended US tax laws to require that Social
Security taxes be paid only on wages of household help that exceed $1000
annually, up from the previous $50 per quarter.  This change was set in motion
by the revelation in January 1993 that President Clinton's nominee for Attorney
General, Zoey Baird, had failed to pay Social Security taxes for the illegal
alien maid she employed.  Households that employ maids will pay the tax once
each year, when they file their own tax returns.]<p>
<p>
Immigration is usually a bipartisan issue--the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986, for example, was carried largely by a Republican Senator and a
Democratic Representative.  SOS is opposed by most Democrats, but it has split
Republicans.  Among the putative Republican contenders for President in 1996,
Wilson and Patrick Buchanan have campaigned for the measure, while William
Bennett and Jack Kemp, both with more libertarian philosophies, oppose SOS for
fostering an "anti-immigrant climate."  Immigrants, they argue, are likely to
be Republican voters, since they have the "entrepreneurial spirit and self
reliance, hostility to government intervention, strong family values and deeply
rooted religious faith."  Kemp reportedly acted to prevent the 1996 Republican
platform from having a nativist or anti-immigrant plank.  <p>
<p>
On October 27, the Justice Department publicized a legal opinion that asserted
that SOS was not significantly different from a Texas law denying free public
education to illegal alien children that the US Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4
vote, found to be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
amendment to the US constitution in 1982.  This opinion marked the latest salvo
in a running debate between Attorney General Reno and California Governor
Wilson over how to deal with illegal immigration; Reno announced her opposition
to SOS with the statement that "it doesn't make sense to kick kids out of
school." <p>
<p>
Conservative commentator George Will endorsed SOS, attacking the 1982 US
Supreme Court decision.  He noted that two of the dissenters in 1982 remain
justices, but only one supporter, and predicted that if the Supreme Court were
to re-consider the issue, the justices would deny illegal alien children free
public education.  He believes that Proposition 187 is not about what a
national immigration policy should be, but what state policy should be
regarding violators of the national law. <p>
<p>
Commission on Immigration Reform Chairperson Barbara Jordan and several other
commissioners also attacked the SOS initiative, which was co-authored by CIR
commissioner Harold Ezell.  They asserted that the SOS provision to deny free
public education to illegal alien children was mean-spirited and not practical.
SOS supporters countered that Jordan's criticism was aimed at helping
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown, who opposes SOS.  <p>
<p>
Most supporters and opponents of SOS, as well as the CIR, have been careful to
draw a line between illegal immigration and legal immigration.  The two major
authors of SOS, former INS officials Alan Nelson and Harold Ezell, have said
that if the US had effective means to deal with illegal immigration, SOS would
not be necessary.<p>
<p>
 Mexican government reactions<p>
<p>
The Mexican government opposed Proposition 187.  After asserting that it does
not want to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, the Mexican
government goes on to argue that it must protect the interests of the Mexicans
in the US  by working to prevent the passage of SOS.  Mexico's Deputy Foreign
Secretary Andres Rozental argued that Mexicans in California are being used as
a scapegoat for the economic crisis in the state.  Mexican President Carlos
Salinas  called Prop. 187 "unacceptable."  <p>
On October 28, the Mexican government complained to the US Department of State
about the "climate of hostility that prevails in California and the growing
incidence of abuse and harassment against Mexican nationals."  <p>
<p>
The weekend of October 29, thousands of Mexicans participated in "Operation
Dignity" and refused to shop in the US.  Organizers said that the protest cut
in half the number of shoppers who usually shop in the US on weekends.
Protesters burned California Governor Wilson in effigy and held signs that read
"Say no to 187, No to Pig Wilson."  <p>
<p>
 Local Debates<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 was the focus of many local school board and civic meetings,
extensive coverage of its potential effects, and numerous editorials.  Most of
these meetings, stories, and editorials ended with pleas to vote against SOS.
A typical news article noted that, like the work registry proposed by the CIR,
if enacted ALL persons seeking services (SOS) or jobs (CIR) would have to
verify their legal status.  Since SOS provides no funds to California schools
for verification, the schools would have to find the funds to verify the status
of 5.2 elementary and secondary pupils, and two million students in colleges
and universities. <p>
<p>
Many school districts held public meetings to discuss estimates of their lost
revenues if SOS were enacted.  The Los Angeles Unified School District, the
nation's largest, estimated that it would lose $4,200 state dollars for each of
the estimated 100,000 illegal alien children enrolled.  But the big losses in
revenue would come if Los Angeles refused to educate illegal alien children,
AND the federal government in retaliation cut off funds for disadvantaged and
bilingual US citizen and legal immigrant students.  In Los Angeles's case,
almost two-thirds of the estimated $1 billion loss in education funds would
come from the potential loss of federal funds for US citizen and legal
immigrant students. <p>
<p>
SOS supporters assert that verification need not be costly.  Schools today
require that pupils provide proof of age and immunization and a local address
to enroll.  SOS supporters assert that most parents today provide birth
certificates to prove their children's ages, so that schools are already in a
position to verify the legal status of most school children.  In doubtful
cases, the child could receive schooling while a secondary check is completed.
SOS opponents counter that each school would have to be hooked up to the INS
computers so that the legal status of non-US citizens with INS numbers could be
verified immediately; such computer hookups would be very expensive.<p>
<p>
Opponents of SOS asked teachers and other public employees to sign pledges
that, if Proposition 187 is approved by California voters, they would engage in
civil disobedience and continue to provide services to unauthorized aliens.
Signers pledge to "continue to provide services to all who request them" and to
"refuse to verify immigration status as required by Proposition 187."  <p>
<p>
California's Attorney General announced on October 31 that he had developed
forms so that public employees could report suspected illegal aliens to his
office, but that his office would not prosecute those who failed to report.  In
most cases, administrative or intake staff, not teachers or doctors, determine
who receives services.<p>
<p>
Nearly 70,000 people protested against SOS in Los Angeles on October 16. The
march was billed as one of the largest ever mounted for immigration rights.  On
October 27, an estimated 8,000 high school students in Southern California left
school to protest SOS.  The anti-SOS campaign has been split between the
"responsible" Taxpayers Against 187, which acknowledges that illegal
immigration is a problem, but SOS is not the solution, and Californians United
Against Prop 187, a coalition of local organizations that e.g., encouraged the
student walkouts, organized rallies featuring Mexican flags, and heckled
pro-SOS speakers at debates.<p>
<p>
In San Diego County, voters view illegal immigration as the biggest issue in
the state, and a poll conducted October 18-25 by the San Diego Union-Tribune,
shows that 62 percent of the county's voters favor Prop. 187, while only 29
oppose it.<p>
<p>
The debate over SOS was conducted largely on emotional grounds.  SOS supporters
argued that the federal government has demonstrated in the eight years since
IRCA was enacted that it cannot reduce illegal immigration, forcing California
voters to "take a stand."  SOS opponents asserted that, if SOS is approved,
civil liberties would be at risk, as millions of teachers and nurses were
forced to become "immigration cops" required to report suspected illegal
aliens.<p>
<p>
Most commentaries on both sides agreed that the federal government should do
more to reduce illegal immigration, and that states such as California deserve
federal reimbursement for the costs of providing services to the unauthorized
aliens who elude government border and interior controls.  But proponents of
SOS go further and argue that illegal aliens are coming to California to obtain
government services and welfare benefits, so that passage and enforcement of
SOS would lead to an exodus of illegal aliens and less taxpayer costs even if
the federal government continued to fail in its efforts to control the border.
<p>
<p>
SOS opponents, on the other hand, argue that unauthorized aliens who are denied
services will not leave the US, but will remain uneducated and a threat to
public health.  Furthermore, some argue,  unauthorized workers fill vacant jobs
on farms, in factories, and in hotels, so that, if their entry really were
curbed, California may suffer during economic and labor market adjustments. <p>
<p>
 Expert Analyses<p>
 <p>
A few newspapers used the SOS campaign to try to educate their readers about
the economic issues raised by illegal and legal immigration, but the major
conclusion of many such articles is that experts disagree.  Instead of
comparing the effects of immigration to other phenomenon on which there is
general agreement on the sign of the effects, but disagreement on the
magnitude, and thus room for debate over what should be done, many articles
quoted immigration "experts" as saying that there is NO agreement on
anything--e.g., "the best people...threw their hands up in the air" when asked
about the economic effects of immigrants. <p>
<p>
Such assertions are neither helpful nor true.  Just as with minimum wage laws,
or the impacts of unions, there is both theory and empirical evidence that
higher minimum wages reduce the number of jobs, and that aggressive unions
raise wages and reduce employment.  The disagreement is not over the sign of
the effect--more immigrant workers MUST, according to theory, have some adverse
effects on the wages or job opportunities of US workers.  The debate is over
the magnitude of wage depression and displacement--are the effects significant
and,  if they are, are the costs of the additional  immigration controls needed
worthwhile.  <p>
<p>
After over 50 years of minimum wages, there is still no agreement on the exact
number of jobs lost because most US workers must be paid at least $4.25 hourly.
Most Americans seem to agree that the job losses due to minimum wages are a
reasonable price for society to pay to assure "decent" wages at the bottom of
the labor market.  The economic effects of immigration might best be considered
in a similar light.<p>
<p>
Two hallmarks of the SOS campaign stand out.  First, it is clear that
Californians feel strongly about illegal immigration--the issue in most polls
is second only to concern about crime.  Second, the debate did little to help
voters think about the longer-term issues involved in having large numbers of
skilled and unskilled immigrants enter the US at the end of the 20th century.
<p>
<p>
If arrayed by their education or skills, immigrants---both legal and
illegal--exhibit an hourglass or barbell distribution.  Immigrants are more
likely than the native-born to have more than a college degree and less than
eight years of schooling--means that many debates about the average or typical
immigrant are no longer instructive.<p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Commission
on Immigration Reform Issues Report</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The nine-member Commission on Immigration Reform created by IMMACT in 1990
issued its interim report on September 30.  The CIR recommended unanimously
that a registry combining data from the INS and the Social Security
Administration be tested in the five states with the most illegal aliens to
improve the enforcement of employer sanctions.  <p>
<p>
Even though each verification could be done for an estimated half-cent, so that
verifying the 50 to 60 million new hires annually would cost $25 to 30 million,
and the national registry could be established within five years for $250 to
$300 million.  Estimates of the cost of issuing new identity cards to all US
residents, and clearing up problems in the INS database, could cost
considerably more.  The CIR hopes that state tests could yield the best design
for a national registry.<p>
<p>
The CIR recommended seven steps to deal with illegal and legal immigration.
The CIR asserted that legal immigration has been and continues to be beneficial
to the U.S., but that the furor over backdoor illegal immigration threatens to
lead to pressure to reduce front-door legal immigration.  To prevent a backlash
against legal immigration, unauthorized immigration must be curbed through
improved border management, meaning there is a need for more efforts to deter
illegal entry with operations such as  Hold-the-Line in El Paso and Gatekeeper
in San Diego, coupled with expedited legal entries so that those who can enter
legally do so; better enforcement of labor laws; and the pilot registry to
improve employee verification.  <p>
<p>
The CIR recommended that legal immigrants remain eligible for welfare benefits
on the same basis as U.S. citizens, putting itself on record against recent
laws that have paid for e.g., extended unemployment benefits by denying some
newly-arrived immigrants cash assistance benefits for three to five years.
However, the CIR recommended that family members who e.g.  sponsor the entry of
their parents, promising to prevent them from becoming "public charges" in the
U.S., be legally obligated to live up to their sponsorship agreements.  This
would change current practice, since courts have held that sponsorship
agreements are not legally binding.<p>
<p>
The CIR recommended that criminal aliens in U.S. jails be promptly removed,
either to serve their sentences in their countries of origin, or be deported as
soon as they complete their US sentences.  The CIR has suggested that
strategies be developed to deal with immigration emergencies, such as those
with Cuba, and Haiti in 1994.  The CIR  called for better data be assembled,
and that the methodologies underlying state suits for federal reimbursement of
immigrant costs be assessed.  Finally, CIR recommended that the US cooperate
with the migrants' countries of origin to better manage immigration from
them.<p>
<p>
The CIR's report was generally praised by editorialists and commentators.
Journalist David Broder, for example, asserted that Barbara Jordan's civil
rights credentials permit her to speak with a definitive voice on the complex
issues raised by immigration.  Newspaper editorials generally endorsed the
CIR's recommendations with if-we-don't -accept-this,
something-more-drastic-is-likely-to-be-enacted.<p>
<p>
Most of the criticism of the CIR's recommendations came from civil liberty and
ethnic organizations such as the ACLU and La Raza; 42 House members signed a
letter to President Clinton on October 5 opposing the registry on the grounds
that it would decrease labor market discrimination against minorities.  The
ACLU solicited funds to oppose what they called CIR's call for a national ID
card to separate "them and us."  <p>
<p>
The registry proposal was also denounced by a number of religious and ethnic
groups.  Newspapers ran profiles of legal immigrants and citizens who "look and
talk" foreign and who fear that the registry proposal would lead to employers,
perhaps mistakenly, refusing to hire them.<p>
<p>
More serious are the concerns of labor market specialists that the registry
might increase contingent employment.  Many employers currently collude with
the unauthorized workers they hire to go through the motions of employment
verification.  If a worker provides a Social Security number that the computer
cannot verify, and that, because of errors in the data base, workers are given
30 or 60 days to go to the Social Security office and clear up the matter.  If
the worker does not visit the Social Security office, the employer would then
dismiss him/her, but could then rehire the worker under a new SSN and name, and
begin the process anew.<p>
<p>
Both INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and Attorney General Janet Reno said that
they agreed with the CIR that workplace enforcement must be improved, and that
the administration was carefully studying the CIR's recommendations.  But an
Office of Management and Budget official was quoted on September 30 as saying
that the Clinton Administration opposed the registry idea.  Jordan dismissed
reports that the Administration was rejecting the CIR's verification
recommendation;  she predicted that the Administration would embrace the
registry test.  But on October 3, Deputy White House Press Secretary Ginny
Terzano said that the administration would like to improve existing systems and
give them a chance to work more effectively before testing the registry. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Jordan was originally scheduled to head a list of witnesses testifying
before the Subcommittees on International Law, Immigration, and Refugees of the
House Judiciary Committee on October 3 on the need for a registry to make more
effective efforts to prevent illegal aliens from obtaining jobs.  Instead, on
October 5, officials from the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Justice outlined what they were doing to make sanctions enforcement more
effective.  Instead of endorsing the registry proposal, INS Commissioner
Meissner said that the Administration was studying it carefully.<p>
<p>
Bernard Anderson, Assistant Secretary, Employment Standards Administration,
told the subcommittee that "employer sanctions can reach its potential to play
an important role in controlling illegal migration if it is substantially
simplified in operation and enforced firmly. In addition, employers'
verification obligations must be implemented in a fair, non- discriminatory
manner and, just as important, employer sanctions must be complemented with
expanded and better targeted labor law enforcement."<p>
<p>
In his last hearing as chair of the House Immigration Subcommittee, Rep Romano
Mazzoli (D-Ky) reminded INS Commissioner Doris Meissner that she promised to
improve the agency's management in 1981, when she was acting commissioner.  He
complained that INS commissioners have for years promised that the solution to
the agency's management woes were just around the corner.<p>
<p>
During her testimony, Meissner said that "control with compassion" is one of
the goals of the INS.  She said that it is "the hallmark of this
Administration's position on immigration policy."   She added, "to continue a
generous legal immigration policy, the United States must be effective in
gaining control of its borders and deterring illegal immigration and the
attendant costs associated with it." <p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Operation
Gatekeeper in San Diego</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 1, 1994, the US Border Patrol assigned 200 additional agents to
guard the 14 miles of border between the US and Mexico south of San Diego.  The
goal of Operation Gatekeeper is to make it impossible for aliens to avoid
capture.  Between the port of entry at Highway 5 and the ocean, there is a
fence, high intensity lights, and three lines of agents, all designed to
advertise to potential illegal entrants that illegal entry will result in
apprehension.  All those apprehended are fingerprinted electronically, and
between October 1 and 6, about six percent of the 6,000 aliens apprehended were
recidivists caught for the second or third time.  <p>
<p>
There were about 25,000 apprehensions in the San Diego sector in October 1994,
compared with 31,500 in October 1993 and 27,600 in September 1994.  The Border
Patrol achieved its goal of pushing aliens seeking to enter the US illegally to
the east--apprehensions in the Imperial Beach sector closest to the ocean
dropped from 2/3 of the average 1000 apprehensions daily in the first half of
the month to 40 percent of the average 700 daily apprehensions at the end of
the month.  Apprehensions in the more inland Brown Field area, by contrast,
rose from an average 150 daily at the beginning of October to almost 200
daily.<p>
<p>
Alien smugglers have been able to evade some past control efforts--using
cellular phones to know when the Border Patrol checkpoints on Highways 5 and 15
are down, for example, to smuggle aliens through, and using juvenile drivers
and nearly worthless vehicles to cope with smuggling penalties and vehicle
seizure.<p>
  <p>
Some speculated that putting more agents on the border at San Diego would not
be as effective as this saturate-the-border strategy was in El Paso because
many of the aliens entering the US at San Diego had come from the interior of
Mexico and were attempting to migrate to Los Angeles.  In EL Paso, 70 percent
of the illegal entrants were destined for the El Paso area, while over 95
percent of those apprehended south of San Diego are headed for destinations
outside the area, usually to Los Angeles, 120 miles north.  <p>
<p>
This means the reaction to saturating the border with agents is likely to be
different--in El Paso, reducing illegal entries and expediting legal entries
was supported by 90 percent of EL Paso residents.  In San Diego, most aliens
pay smugglers $300 for the trip to Los Angeles, and many have a mindset that
they must attempt illegal entry repeatedly until they succeed.<p>
<p>
Some predicted that there would be violence on the border, as desperate aliens
and their smugglers clashed with the Border Patrol.  This does not seem to be
the case; during the first three weeks of Operation Gatekeeper, there were only
five charges that the Border Patrol abused aliens attempting to illegally enter
the US.  However, legal services groups on October 24, sent a letter to the INS
complaining about the "rough handling" of apprehended aliens, the lack of food
in "overcrowded" detention facilities, and the "practice" of returning men to
Mexico about 90 miles east of San Diego in Mexicali, while women and children
are returned to Tijuana.<p>
<p>
Some Mexican observers, as well as the president of the Border Patrol agents'
union, are skeptical of the effectiveness of Operation Gatekeeper.  Several
Mexican critics complained that saturating the border with agents runs counter
to NAFTA's goal of free trade.  The Border  Patrol union would presumably like
to see even more agents assigned to border security.<p>
<p>
The Border Patrol has budgeted $236 million for safeguarding the US-Mexican
border in FY95, equivalent to $650,000 daily.  The next saturate-the-border
operation is Operation Safeguard in Arizona.<p>
<p>
Near Pueblo, Colorado, a federal prison includes inmates from 129 countries,
and foreign-born persons, most convicted of drug offenses, are 28 percent of
the inmates.  Nationwide, the cost of keeping foreigners in jail is $1 million
daily.  In an effort to reduce these costs, the US is attempting to return
convicted foreign felons to their home countries--about 200 have been returned
to Mexico so far.<p>
<p>
Florida has received permission to try a pilot program for three months in
which illegal aliens who are accused of misdemeanors and non-violent felonies
could avoid trial in the US by agreeing to be deported.  Those deported would
have to agree not to return to the US.<p>
 <p>
Jamie Gorelick, Deputy US Attorney General, reviewed Operation Gatekeeper on
October 13 and reported that it is part of a Clinton Administration plan "to
close the entire border."  <p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Judge
Stops Return of Cubans</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 14, President Clinton announced that Cubans being held at Guantanamo
would have to return first to Cuba to apply for U.S. immigrant status or to
participate in a lottery that will select a total of at least 20,000 Cuban
immigrants each year.<p>
<p>
On October 24 attorneys filed a class-action suit on behalf of some of the
Cubans being held in Guantanamo, arguing that the conditions there are so
intolerable that the US government is forcing Cubans to return "voluntarily."
The suit asked a federal judge to order the administration to permit Cubans in
Guantanamo to receive counseling about their rights and to have immigration
hearings there.  On October 25, a US district judge blocked the return to
Havana of 23 Cubans, pending a resolution of the suit.  On October 29, 21 of
these Cubans signed a letter to the judge asking that they be allowed to return
to Havana.<p>
<p>
So far, 42 of the 23,699 Cubans at Guantanamo have returned to Cuba
voluntarily.  Another 8,206 Cubans are housed in Panama. Nearly 20,000 Haitians
were at Guantanamo, and the State Department reported on October 25 that 13,500
of them have voluntarily returned home.  The Clinton Administration said that
the elderly and unaccompanied minors among the 27,000 Cubans housed at the U.S.
base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would be allowed to enter the U.S.  <p>
<p>
The US and Cuba are continuing talks on their recent migration agreement.  The
US in August prohibited Americans from sending money to relatives in Cuba--$250
to $500 million per year--and Cuba would like the ban lifted. <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Agricultural
Labor Shortages</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On September 27, 1994, the Los Angeles Times reported that "raisin farmers were
hit by shortage of workers."  The article quoted grower assertions that 50
percent of the estimated 50,000 harvest workers who cut bunches of grapes and
lay them on paper trays to dry into raisins were unauthorized, that farm labor
contractors who organize the crews to harvest grapes were reporting 15 to 20
percent shortages, and that there was a conflict between traditional grower
support for Governor Wilson and his endorsement of the SOS initiative that
would deny benefits to illegal immigrants.  The story ended on a familiar
refrain, quoting a raisin packer asserting that "if you removed every illegal
alien from this state tomorrow, you'd see the business--and not just the
agricultural business--start to crumble."<p>
<p>
Growers fear that the passage of Proposition 187 will lead severe labor
shortages.  They have already met with the INS to discuss what will happen if
the proposition passes.  Some growers are pushing for a guestworker program to
allow temporary farm workers to enter the country legally. <p>
<p>
"Farm labor shortages" were the rallying cry of California and other western
farmers in the debate preceding IRCA in 1986, and California Congressional
representatives from Representatives Coehlo and Panetta to Senator Wilson
energetically pushed their colleagues to accept their constituents arguments
that the "nature of California agriculture" required a unique guestworker
program.  Such activities prompted President Clinton  in October 1994 to note
that 'If the people in California would be fully candid, they would have to
say<p>
that leadership decisions made in the past in California have actually<p>
facilitated illegal immigration."<p>
<p>
Farmers won in IRCA, a unique SAW legalization program and insurance that, if
too many newly-legalized farmworkers left the fields, replenishment immigrants
could be imported.  And farmers monitored the labor market closely.  In 1987,
isolated reports of labor shortages led then-Senator Pete Wilson to write a
letter to President Reagan complaining of "burdensome SAW application
procedures."  In the House, Representative Fazio requested a GAO survey of West
Coast growers to provide "proof" of a farm labor shortage.<p>
<p>
Fazio won a border-entry legalization program under which alien workers without
documents could come to a US port of entry, assert that they had worked as
illegal aliens in 1985-86, and then receive temporary work permits to enter the
US, so that they could work while obtaining documentation of their 1985-86
employment, and then apply for legalization.  Over 100,000 aliens entered the
US in this manner, helping to end complaints of labor shortages.<p>
<p>
There were practically no reports of farm labor shortages between 1988 and
1993.  Indeed, in preparing its final report in 1992, the grower-dominated
Commission on Agricultural Workers concluded that "there is a general
oversupply of farm labor nationwide." (xx), that "employer sanctions have been
ineffective at preventing, and have not significantly curtailed, the employment
of unauthorized workers in agriculture," (xxi), and that, "since IRCA, growers
have generally been able to make planting decisions and assume that workers
would be available...INDIVIDUAL PRODUCERS...may experience spot labor shortages
[that can be remedied with] better systems for recruiting and training workers,
transporting them to their jobs, and providing housing."(xxiii, emphasis
added).<p>
<p>
Raisin harvesting is the single most labor-intensive harvesting activity in
North America, and fears of farm labor shortages have been part of the industry
since is founding in California in the 1880s--there were almost as many acres
of raisin grapes in California in 1920 as there are today. The raisin industry
is part of the larger grape industry--about 48 percent of California's 700,000
acres of vineyards are planted with varieties that are usually used for wine,
40 percent to raisin varieties, and 12 percent for table grape varieties.  But
the major raisin grape variety--Thompson seedless--is versatile--it can be used
for table grapes, wine, or raisins.  The need for raisin harvesters near Fresno
depends on the relative prices of tables grapes, wine grapes, and raisin
grapes, as well as whether the raisin industry is engaged in one of its
periodic don't-pick programs to limit the supply and thus increase the price of
raisins.<p>
<p>
Raisin harvesting is a relatively short-term and low-paying job.  According the
most recent definitive study of raisin harvesters, workers prefer jobs that
last longer than the four- to six-week raisin harvest, such as citrus
harvesting, or jobs that enable them to have higher hourly earnings, such as
Washington apple harvesting.  Although there is a relative lull in worker
activity in early August, growers aiming to maximize the sugar content of their
raisins wait as long as possible to begin harvesting their grapes, which
produces a perennial labor shortage as growers scramble to get the grapes cut
and dried by the sun before the first rain falls.<p>
<p>
In 1994, there was bumper crop of raisins and a bumper crop of Washington
apples. Many workers went north to pick apples, resulting in a "shortage" of
raisin harvesters.  Some officials estimate that the labor pool shrank by 15
percent.  Many growers reluctantly raised the raisin piecerate wage from $0.15
to $0.16 or even $0.17 for each 25 pounds of green grapes that are cut and laid
on a paper tray to dry.  Many growers also raised the commission they pay to
farm labor contractors from $0.05 to $0.06, but $0.16 was the average rate paid
in 1991.  At this rate, 10 percent of the workers earned less than the $4.25
minimum wage in 1991. <p>
<p>
In 1994, rains came with about 25 percent still on the ground.  Growers
predicted that the combination of rains and the labor shortage will lower crop
estimates  between 20,000 to 50,000 tons for a total yield of approximately
404,677 tons. However, even though the rain may have ruined some of the raisins
drying in the sun, the president of the Fresno Cooperative Raisin Growers noted
that "Even if the 25 percent that's out in the field now got totally wiped out
by rain, there's still plenty of raisins to take care of supply and demand for
a whole year."<p>
<p>
There will always be labor shortages in the raisin industry--the only question
is how much growers will complain about them.  Any industry that offers a short
season of work, does little to recruit workers, and discards them when the
harvest is completed, will be forced to use workers who are trying to find
better jobs.  SOS provides a convenient political target for what in 1994
appears to be better job opportunities for workers who might in other years
found raisin harvesting to be their best US job option.  <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Chinese
Alien Smuggling</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Chinese triads obtain an estimated $3 billion per year smuggling 100,000
Chinese aliens into the US.  They worked in relative anonymity until the
grounding of the Golden Venture off New York City in 1993.  Chinese triads also
smuggle prostitutes and heroin into the US.  <p>
<p>
Chinese smuggling to the US reportedly began in the 1980s, when farmers in
Fujian, on the southeastern coast of China, lost their land to factories, which
hired mostly young women.  Networks soon developed to smuggle people to Taiwan,
Southeast Asia and Latin America--more than 90 percent of the 500,000 mainland
Chinese reportedly smuggled into the US over the past decade have been from
Fuzhou, capital of the Fujian province, and the three adjacent counties.   <p>
<p>
The smuggling routes follow along well-established routes through transit
countries such as Belize, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Mexico and
Russia.  Many Chinese trade their passport for a Taiwanese passport, and are
then moved to country such as Dominican Republic, for continuing passage to the
United States.  China's Public Security Bureau estimates that there are a half
million Chinese waiting for transit to the West in Moscow, Ho Chi Minh City,
Bangkok, Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Romania and Bulgaria. Their final
destinations, include the US , Australia, Austria, Italy, Germany and the Czech
Republic.  <p>
<p>
According to Willard Myers, director of the Center for the Study of Asian
Organized Crime in Philadelphia, Taiwan-based transportation companies
cooperate closely with the Chinese triads.  Forty Taiwanese ships have been
identified by the INS as transporting illegal aliens. The money earned by the
illegal smuggling is laundered in Taiwan, where there are safe houses.
Immigrants typically pay about $30,000 for a standard air-smuggling package,
which includes $500 for a Chinese passport and $250 for an exit visa.  An
"official government business" passport, which is rarely challenged by the INS,
costs an additional $15,000. <p>
<p>
Government corruption in transit countries is reportedly rife.  In Belize, the
minister for immigration was fired after he accepted bribes from Chinese
smugglers.  In July, the regional chief of the Mexican immigration service in
Tijuana and two of his deputies were dismissed and charged with corruption.  In
May, a Hispanic civil rights leader and three Taiwanese were charged with
providing false documentation to illegal Asian immigrants (see MN, May 1994).
<p>
<p>
Other smuggling rings imitate the Chinese triads.  In September, 1994, the
owner of an Indian restaurant and 11 others in Seattle were arrested for
smuggling 900 people, charging each $10,000 to $14,000 per person, or an
estimated $13 million since 1985.  The smugglers brought Indian and Pakistani
nationals to the United States via Canada and Mexico.  Most were taken to
Panama, moved by land to Mexico, and then walked across the Mexican-US.
border.  Another 100 entered the US from Vancouver via Seattle taxi drivers,
many of whom are also from India and Pakistan.   <p>
<p>
In New York City, the US Department of State is investigating several smuggling
rings smuggling Albanian immigrants into the US with false passports purchased
in Thailand.  Most of the Albanians are arriving in New York from flights that
originate in Vienna and Bucharest.   <p>
<p>
The Clinton administration proposed tougher anti-smuggling laws in June 1993.
Clinton had recommended increasing penalties for alien smuggling, interdicting
boats on the high seas, and expanding investigative efforts.  Congress, though
it finally passed the crime bill, deleted the anti-smuggling proposals,
including the power to quickly return illegal immigrants. <p>

<a name="RTFToC8">Immigrant-Native
Tensions in Wisconsin</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
On October 16, 1994, the CBS TV-News magazine 60 Minutes described
refugee-native tensions in Wausau, Wisconsin.  This small city was populated
almost exclusively by the descendants of German and Scandinavian immigrants
when, during the 1980's, several churches sponsored Hmong refugees.  Today,
Wausau's 4,000 refugees are 11 percent of the population, and policies adopted
to integrate them have divided the city.<p>
<p>
About three-fourths of the Hmong are receiving welfare payments, causing some
resentment as property taxes go up to build additional schools for the children
of non-working parents - Hmong are one-fourth of the elementary school class.
To promote integration, the Wausau school board began busing school children to
achieve a rough balance between  Hmong and other children in each school.  In
response, the school board that endorsed busing was recalled, and today mostly
Hmong children are being bussed to achieve ethnic balance.<p>
<p>
Many of the Hmong have become US citizens, and they sometimes take several jobs
in order to sign affidavits that they will be able to support the family
members whose immigration they are sponsoring.  Some Wausau leaders are calling
for a moratorium on immigration into the city.  They stress that current Hmong
residents were welcome, but that the community needs "breathing room" to
integrate the Hmong in their midst.  The show ended on a
no-good-deed-goes-unpunished theme:  the beneficence of Wausau churches set in
motion an immigration process that has divided the city.<p>

<a name="RTFToC10">Immigration's
Role in European Elections</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The Freedom Party's Joerg Haider, who began an unsuccessful signature
campaign to stop immigration until Austria's housing and employment problems
improve, received 22 percent of the Austrian vote, an increase of six percent
over the previous election.  The<b> </b>Freedom Party has called for a
moratorium on immigration, and it appealed to young blue-collar voters with an
"Austria for Austrians" campaign.  For the first time, the Social Democratic
party (SPD) and the Austrian People's Party (OVP) won less than 80 percent of
the vote.   <p>
<p>
In Belgium, the Flemish Nationalist Party, using the slogan "Our People First,"
won nearly one-third of the vote to take control of the City Council in
Antwerp, a 10 percent gain over six years ago.   Extreme-right parties
typically obtained 20 to 30 percent of the vote in local elections in October
with a simple answer to immigration problems:  seal the borders and deport
resident immigrants.<p>
<p>
In both countries, voter frustration with joblessness, crime, and economic
insecurity were blamed for the drift from mainstream parties toward the
extremes. Mainstream French political parties held the National Front to 10
percent of the vote in European Parliament elections in June.<p>
<p>
But the sharpest drop in support for anti-foreigner political parties was in
Germany.   In Germany, the CDU-CSU-FDP coalition retained control of the
Bundestag and government, with a margin reduced to 12 seats.  The Free
Democrats made dual citizenship for foreigners living in Germany one of their
goals for the new government, a position opposed by its coalition partners.<p>
<p>
The Republican Party in Germany, with 17,000 members--down from 25,000 in
1992--earned only two percent of the vote, not enough for a seat in the
Bundestag.   The decline in the party's popularity seems to stem from the
tightening of asylum laws in 1993 and the subsequent decline in the numbers of
asylum seekers.  In another sign of the decline of the anti-foreigner sentient,
violence against foreigners has declined in 1994, from 1,654 cases in the first
nine months of 1993 to 1,052 in 1994. <p>
<p>
Some foreigners in Germany believe that the Christian Democrats tough stands on
immigration in 1992-93 defused the appeal of the right wing parties.  After
five Turks were killed last year in a Solingen arson fire, Kohl promised to
make naturalization easier, but then backed off for fear of anti-foreigner
violence. <p>
<p>
According to a recent poll by the  Center for Turkey Studies in Essen, Germany,
62 percent of the Turks in Germany want German citizenship, but they do not
want to have to give up their Turkish citizenship, which would mean forfeiting
any claim to property in Turkey.  If they became German citizens, 42 percent of
the foreigners--Turks, Greeks, Italians and former Yugoslavs--would vote for
the Social Democrats (SDP), and 11 percent for the Greens.  Only 11 percent
would vote for Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) which, according to the
report, helped to explain why the CDU does not support dual nationality.
Frankfurt, whose population is almost one-third foreigners, has an "Auslander<p>
Parliament" that meets monthly and can submit requests to the city's parliament
consisting of 51 foreigners, as well as an office of Multicultural Affairs.<p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Identity
Checks in France</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Under instructions from Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, French police in
August, 1994 increased identity checks of foreigners and foreign-looking
nationals.  Under 1993 legislation aimed at combating terrorism, police are
permitted to "control" persons suspected of being foreigners.  In opinion
polls, 57 percent of those surveyed support the identity checks.<p>
<p>
Some observers believe that the police are targeting dark-skinned immigrants
who refuse to assimilate into French society.  France has some of Europe's most
liberal naturalization policies, as well as a tradition of expecting newcomers
to "act French" in public.<p>
<p>
There are about three million Muslims in France, and 500,000 of them are French
citizens.  Frequent identity checks, plus the detention of "hundreds" of
Muslims for immigration irregularities, may threaten what some call the
"fragile truce" between French society and Muslim immigrants.  <p>
<p>
The crackdown is reportedly motivated by fears of Islamic terrorism and several
well-publicized incidents of Islamic non-conformity in French schools.  France
has expelled at least 20 Algerian-born immigrants accused of terrorism, and the
French Education Minister in September 1994 reminded school principals to
prohibit girls from wearing "ostentatious" Islamic head scarves to school.  <p>
<p>
Classes were suspended for two weeks at the beginning of the school year in a
northern Paris suburb by demonstrations in support of four girls who appeared
on the first day of school wearing head scarves, leading to their suspension
from classes--they sit in the library instead of participating in class.
Newspapers report that both Islamic extremists and National Front supporters
stand outside school gates, waiting to proselytize among the youth who are
upset by the debate over head scarves.<p>
<p>
On October 21, a Muslim cleric from Metz who urged girls to defy the ban and
wear head scarves to school was expelled to Morocco under an "absolute
emergency" procedure that bypassed the usual judicial proceedings.  This iman
allegedly opposed the integration of Muslims into French society.<p>

from Greece, trying to leave Albania by boat for Italy. <p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Americans
on German Immigration Controls</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The frustration over American failures to control illegal immigration, and the
apparent effectiveness of German control efforts, prompted a series of articles
in the American press that explained what Germany does to control illegal
immigration.  Typical stories noted that Germany has separate residence and
work ID systems, that illegal aliens are not eligible for public education or
emergency health care benefits, and that children born to illegal alien parents
in Germany are not entitled to automatic German citizenship.  <p>
<p>
In 1992, some 438,000 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany.  Most arrived
legally, often as tourists, and then filled out forms asserting that, if they
were returned to their countries of citizenship, they would face political
persecution.  Most of these asylum applications were rejected, but it took two
to five years for appeals to be exhausted, and during that period, asylum
applicants were entitled to housing, meals, and in some cases, work permits.<p>
<p>
On July 1, 1993, Germany modified its asylum policies.  With more hearing
officers, asylum applications were heard immediately, and the entire process
was reduced to 30 to 60 days.  Asylum applicants from "safe" countries could
file their claims, but then leave Germany while their cases were decided.
Applicants who traveled through safe countries en route to Germany were
returned to e.g., Poland, and told to file their claims there.<p>
<p>
In September, 1993, 10,867 applicants applied for asylum, bringing the total
for 1993 to 92,731.  The two major countries of origin were the former
Yugoslavia, accounting for 30 percent of the asylum applicants in 1994, and
Turkey, accounting for 14 percent.  Germany's labor force is expected to be
41.5 million in 2000, not much larger than the 40.6 million in 1990, but high
unemployment rates are expected to persist because of rising productivity, more
working women, and continued immigration.<p>
<p>
There were 3.5 million unemployed workers in Germany in September, 1994--the
unemployment rate was eight percent in the former West Germany, and 14 percent
in the former East Germany.<p>

Immigration Minister Signs European Agreements</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
During a European trip in early October, Canadian Immigration Minister Sergio
Marchi signed agreements to help ease immigration problems between the
countries.  Effective November 1, 1994, Hungarians became the first Eastern
Europeans to travel to Canada without visas.  <p>
<p>
Canada accepts refugees now living in Hungary.  Since 1990, about 130,000
refugees have come to Hungary, and 2,500 asylum-seekers and another 5,000 to
6,000 families are supported by the state.  Ten percent of the refugees in the
Bicske camp, 35 km west of Budapest, have been granted refugee status.  About
102 refugees left Bicske for Canada and another 75 are expected to leave by
November. <p>
<p>
Canada signed an agreement to provide $1.3 million to help Russia improve its
immigration procedures and border controls.  Canada will help the Russian
government to draft new citizenship laws, provide technology to improve border
control, and help retrain former Soviet immigration officers.  Russia will
provide Canada with access to Russian information on criminals who try to enter
Canada.  <p>
<p>
Canada has recently experienced several publicized crimes committed by illegal
Russian immigrants.  Tightened security, the Canadians hope, will also halt the
spread of international crime, especially money laundering and drug
trafficking, from entering Canada.  About 12,000 Russians are expected to visit
Canada in 1994, and about 1,500 are expected to immigrate legally.   <p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Taiwan
Allows More Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Manufacturing firms in Taiwan have been given the green light by the Council of
Labor Affairs to submit applications to import foreign workers.  The Council
has not set a maximum number of foreign workers who will  be allowed to work in
Taiwan.  <p>
<p>
Employers wanting to employ foreign workers must meet several criteria,
including participation in large-scale public works projects requiring a
minimum capital investment of NT $200 million (US$77 million).  Foreign workers
can be used in construction and manufacturing, but they must not exceed 50
percent of the total workforce in construction or 35 percent of the workforce
in manufacturing.  <p>
<p>
Contractors needing workers to build schools and medical facilities can bring
in foreign workers if the project exceeds NT$150 million in value.  Private
projects and government sponsored social welfare facilities can use foreign
workers if the investment exceeds NT$100 million. All construction projects
using foreign workers must last 18 months or more.<p>
<p>
The Economic Planning and Development Committee of Taiwan estimates that there
will be an annual shortage of 236,000 workers between 1994 and 1996.  The
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics estimates that Taiwan
will need as many as 145,000 additional foreign workers to solve its labor
shortage in 1995.  The manufacturing sector hired 135,000 foreign workers in
1993, an increase of 165 percent over the previous year. <p>
<p>
Taiwan requires employers of foreign workers to pay an employment stability fee
in order to bridge the income gap between Taiwan workers and imported foreign
workers.  As of November 1, the employment stability fee for employers of
foreign workers will be increased by NT$100.  The fees range from
NT$1,400(US$54) for foreign workers in manufacturing to NT$600 (US$23) for
maids. These foreign worker impact fees are adjusted frequently. <p>
<p>
On October 21, the Taiwan Executive Yuan approved a revision in the Employment
Service Law to allow white-collar foreign workers to extend their stays beyond
the previous three-year limit.  Blue-collar foreign workers can extend their
stay from two years to three and one-half years.  Blue-collar foreign workers
will also be required to make deposits with the government to prevent them from
leaving their approved jobs for higher-paying illegal work. <p>
<p>
Over the past two years, the CLA approved requests for 117,408 Thai workers to
work in Taiwan: Thais are about 68 percent of the total foreign labor force in
Taiwan. Thais who want to work in Taiwan must pay job brokerage fees in both
Thailand and Taiwan that range from 70,000 to 100,000 baht (US$2800 to
US$4000).  Many Thai workers leave their construction jobs to work in local
factories at a higher wage, in part to repay their debts to job placement
agencies.  In May, 1994, over 1,000 Thais were reported to have left their
entry jobs and nearly 4,000 had overstayed their permits.  <p>
<p>
The Taiwan government has asked Thailand to crack down on the job placement
agencies, or face the possibility of a ban on Thai workers.  As a result, the
Thai Labour and Social Welfare Ministry began a program to eliminate payments
to Thais placement firms by directly contracting with Taiwan firms.  <p>

to Continue Import of Bangladeshi Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Malaysia agreed to import 50,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers from
Bangladesh each year.  There are currently 100,000 Bangladeshi workers in
Malaysia. <p>
<p>
The Bangladeshi prime minister asked Malaysia to accept up to 750,000
Bangladeshi workers. Bangladesh receives about $900 million annually in
remittances. <p>
<p>
In January 1994, the Malaysian government announced a freeze on the recruitment
of additional foreign workers until illegal immigration was brought under
control. The freeze was relaxed in May 1994, after the Cabinet decided to allow
employers facing labor shortages to apply directly to the government for
foreign workers. <p>
<p>
Malaysia has received $20 billion in foreign investment in manufacturing during
the past six years, helping to generate an annual 8.6 percent growth rate since
1988.  Wages in many jobs are rising at a 10 percent annual rate, unemployment
is less than three percent, and managers and engineers can earn $30,000
annually.<p>
<p>
The plants originally opened by foreign investors to produce electronic
components today employ high percentages of engineers--one in six of the 2,000
workers at Intel's plant in Penang, for example, is an engineer.  Some
speculate that American high-skilled jobs may be at risk as product design and
development follow manufacturing to countries such as Malaysia.<p>

Labor Shortages in Asia</a>

Some four million Asians work in an Asian country other than their own.
Foreign workers are drawn to  South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore by abundant jobs and higher wages.  The major labor exporters are the
Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand.  <p>
<p>
Many countries are both labor exporters and importers-- workers from Burma
migrate to Thailand to fill  jobs left vacant by Thais who are searching for
higher wages in Hong Kong.  Many Asian migrants work illegally; entering on
tourist visas, and using forged papers or expired work permits to obtain jobs.
These vulnerable workers are sometimes abused by employers, some of whom treat
the migrants as indentured servants, controlling not only their working
environment, but also their personal lives. <p>
<p>
In fast-growing Asian countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, the salaries of
engineers and skilled technicians are rising sharply in response to the
creation of three new engineering positions for every two engineering
graduates.  As foreign investors continue to create jobs in these countries,
they increasingly seek to bring with them Indian, Filipino, and Chinese
engineers.  Many business leaders are urging governments to relax their
temporary worker policies until local education systems can catch-up with the
demand for skilled workers. <p>

Between 1990 and 1993, the number of Filipinos abroad has increased from five

Philippines is, after Mexico, the world's second largest country of emigration.
The number of emigrants grew by five percent and contract workers by 56

destination countries between 1985 and 1993 were Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong,
Kuwait, Japan, the UAE, Singapore, Qatar, Bahrain, Brunei and Oman. <p>
<p>
During this period, there were a total of 3,692,690 Filipino overseas workers,
5.7 percent of the total Philippine population, given the current population of
65 million.  In addition, there are tens of thousands of undocumented workers
and immigrants who left the Philippines without the proper documentation from
either the Philippines or their country of destination.  The foreign secretary
estimated that there are as many as six million Filipinos overseas, with
undocumented workers accounting for 30 percent of the total.  <p>
<p>
On October 5, Philippines Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo called on the United
Nations to hold an international conference on global migration and

Cambodia continues to insist that a new immigration law effective September 22

In a September 19 letter to the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the
Cambodian Prime Minister said that "I can give you every assurance that no

taken."  <p>
<p>
The main concern of human rights organizations is the absence of language which
defines Cambodian citizenship, so that any person who is not Khmer could be
expelled.  The UN High Commission for Refugees has been approached about
setting up internment camps within Cambodia, a move which feeds the fears of
the Vietnamese.  UNHCR refused the request, and has criticized Cambodia's
immigration law. <p>
<p>
Independent estimates place the number of Vietnamese living in Cambodia at
150,000 to 500,000; the Cambodian government reports that there are 100,300.
Over half of the Vietnamese arrived in Cambodia after Vietnam's invasion of
Cambodia in 1978. The Khmer Rouge believes that more than four million
Vietnamese secretly occupy Cambodia, and they are plotting to take over the
country. <p>

Cambodia has a population of nine million, compared with 70 million in Vietnam.
Cambodians traditionally fear a Vietnamese takeover. <p>

Replaces Palestinians with Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Israeli government on October 23, 1994 increased the number of foreign
workers permitted to enter the country from 35,000 to 54,000.  The foreign
workers replace the estimated 60,000 Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza who have
been prohibited from working in Israel after the bus bombing in Tel Aviv in
mid-October.  <p>
<p>
Most of Israel's non-Arab guestworkers are from Thailand, China, Romania, and
Bulgaria.  There are currently 34,200 workers, mostly from Romania and
Thailand, who were brought into Israel during previous closures.  The
additional 19,000 guestworkers include 15,000 construction workers and 4,000
agricultural workers. <p>
<p>
It is expected that when Israel reopens the border, a smaller number of
Palestinians will be permitted to work in Israel.  After the border closure in
May 1993, the number of Palestinians working in Israel dropped by an estimated
30,000 to 60,000.  In  Gaza, 50 percent of the 900,000 inhabitants are
unemployed, and most live in refugee camps with below poverty-line incomes.
Restricting their access to the Israeli labor market will create problems for
Palestinian leader Yasar Arafat, since Arab "day workers" who cross into Israel
bring back $700,000 each day, according to the World Bank. <p>
<p>
In a related story, there is a growing movement in Israel to restrict the
immigration of elderly Jews likely to become public charges.  Prime Minister
Rabin opposes this anti-immigrant movement, arguing that aliyah or immigration
is the raison d'etre of Israel.  Israel already discourages elderly Russian
Jews from immigrating; persons over 65 are 1 in 6 Russian immigrants.  Today,
10 percent of the Israeli population is 65 or older. <p>
<p>
In 1993, 76, 410 immigrants moved to Israel, but 29 percent did not declare
themselves to be Jews--their mothers were--and at least a few were quoted as
saying that Israel should help everyone regardless of their religion.  Members
of so-called "Lost Tribes" in India and Africa have begun to apply to immigrate
to Israel, prompting more Israelis to argue that the "law of return" must be
ended.<p>

One illegal immigrant enters South Africa every 10 minutes, according to the
Home Affairs regional director.  In order to stem the tide of illegal entrants,
South Africa is considering a number of measures, including a US-style "green
card,"  without which a foreigner could not work.  <p>
<p>
In 1993, South Africa expelled 96,000 illegal aliens to 39 countries, primarily
Mozambique, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.  But the control immigration officer for the
Johannesburg region estimates that his department is apprehending less than 10
percent of the illegals. <p>
<p>
According to some observers, a country with an unemployment rate of nearly 50
percent, and a population with high expectations, has much to fear from the
estimated two to eight million foreigners in South Africa.  There are reports
from the northern Transvaal that children as young as 12 are working as farm
workers for 10 pounds (US$6) a month--adults receive about 30 pounds (US$18).
<p>
<p>
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party is leading a campaign to
"clean" the country of illegal immigrants.  It is organizing demonstrations and
threatening direct action if the government does not deal with the issue.
Chief Buthelezi is the minister of home affairs, the agency responsible for
immigration. <p>
<p>
Many of the illegal workers are from Zimbabwe, where two million workers are
unemployed.  Farm workers, hotel cleaners and miners are now being joined by
professionals including teachers, doctors, engineers and nurses who find
salaries much higher in South Africa.  There are an estimated 300,000
Zimbabweans in South Africa, most working legally.  <p>
<p>
South Africa deported nearly 10,000 illegal migrants at the end of September.
Over 13,500 Zimbabweans were expelled from Botswana between February and
August, 1994.  The Zimbabwean government fears that these mass deportations of
illegal Zimbabwean workers from Botswana and South Africa will create serious
economic problems for their country.  The Zimbabwe government is asking South
Africa and Botswana to deport the illegal workers in stages, so that the
country has a better chance to absorb them back into the economy. <p>

<a name="RTFToC30">Oman
Imposes Income Tax on Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Oman is the first oil-rich  country to levy an income tax on foreign workers in
an effort to increase government revenues.  Under new legislation, companies
will be taxed according to the number of foreigners they employ, and Omani
citizens will pay taxes for domestic workers.  <p>
<p>
Foreigners earning between US$2,684 and US$3,159 per year will pay taxes
equivalent to six percent of their earnings, and those earning more than US
$3,159 will pay seven percent.  Companies will pay US$158 per year for each
foreign worker they employ, and employers of foreign maids will pay US$408 for
one worker and an additional US$316 for the second worker.  A tax of US$526
will be levied on each foreign driver. <p>

<a name="RTFToC31">Lebanese-Syrian
Migration Agreement</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Lebanon and Syria signed the first agreement on the flow of tens of thousands
of Syrian workers into Lebanon.  The Syrian workers are employed mainly in the
agriculture and construction sector.  Exact numbers are difficult to determine,
because the Syrian workers are not required to have permits.  <p>
<p>
Under the agreement, Syrian workers will still not be required to have a work
permit to enter Lebanon.  The Lebanese Labor Minister estimates that there are
about 150,000 Syrians working in his country, but President Hrawi estimates
there are closer to 700,000.  Talks to increase the workers pay by 88 percent
continue. <p>

Spencer, Sarah(Ed).  1994.  Immigration as an Economic Asset:  The German
Experience.  Staffordshire, UK, Trentham Books.<p>
<p>
This book features five chapters by Germans explaining the evolution and
economic impacts of immigrants in Germany.  According to the British editor,
Britons who participated in the conference at which these papers were presented
were surprised by the dominant roles played by German unions and employers in
establishing German migration policies, and by the general agreement that
immigrant economic impacts were positive in Germany.  Some Britons were
convinced that similar economic reasoning would not be persuasive in Britain,
where politicians are reluctant to change immigration policies.<p>
<p>
Some 4.2 million immigrants entered Germany between 1988 and 1992.  Ursula
Mehrlaender describes the three phases of German immigration--guestworker
recruitment between 1955 and 1973, then the unification of families in Germany,
and after 1985, a dramatic increase in asylum applicants, peaking at 438,000 in
1992.  Ethnic Germans from the ex-USSR and Eastern Europe are not considered to
be immigrants, and are thus excluded from German data on foreigners.<p>
<p>
According to Gieseck and his colleagues, German GNP in 1992 was six percent
higher than in would have been without immigration.  Since foreigners are about
eight percent of the population, this indicates that foreigners have below
average incomes.  Because some foreigners still leave Germany when unemployment
rises, Gieseck calculates that the German unemployment rate would have been 0.2
percent higher without the flexibility provided by immigrants.  Sen emphasizes
that the 1.9 million Turks in Germany have created at least 125,000 jobs in
Turkish-owned firms there.<p>
<p>
According to economic theory, the availability of immigrant workers should
raise profits and depress wages, at least in the short run.  According to Klaus
Zimmermann, in 1992, business profits were 10 percent higher than they would
have been without immigration.  However, Zimmermann estimates that workers
earnings were also raised about five percent by immigration, although he notes
that the presence of young immigrants may make it hard for older German workers
who lose their jobs to find new ones.<p>
<p>
Ralf Ulrich calculates that in 1984, foreigners received more in unemployment
benefits than they paid in unemployment taxes--unemployment benefits in Germany
are financed by worker contributions.  However, immigrants paid more for health
insurance than they cost in benefits.  <p>
<p>
Many German academics and policy makers assert that Germany, whose native
population is shrinking--deaths exceed births--will have to actively accept
immigrants in order to pay its pension obligations.  Even if productivity
rises, and more women join the labor force, there are estimates that Germany
will need to accept at least 300,000 immigrants annually just to keep pension
contributions on active workers manageable.<p>
<p>
Ulrich notes that importing immigrants to provide pension contributions in a
pay-as-you-go system puts a country on an immigration treadmill, because the
immigrants also age, and thus draw pensions themselves.  Even 200,000 young
immigrants annually, most of whom go to work immediately, will provide only a
temporary cushion for the pension system, and they barely make a dent in the
median age of the population.  Furthermore, if less-educated immigrants are
disproportionately affected by technological trends that are raising the
unemployment rates for such workers, their economic and pension contributions
may be less than anticipated.<p>
<p>
Germans disagree on whether immigrants will be needed for economic reasons, and
whether current policies promote immigrant integration.  Zimmermann asserts
that immigrant workers are needed in Germany, and that the how many question
facing all immigration countries should be answered by calculating the marginal
contributions of immigrants, as well as their marginal costs of adaptation, and
halting immigration when costs exceed contributions.  He further echoes the
call for a GATT-analog--a General Agreement on Migration Policy, he asserts,
could allow European countries to establish immigration quotas for economic
migrants, thereby reducing the number of asylum seekers.<p>
<p>
Many Germans and foreign observers have noted the contradiction in current
German immigration policy--promote the integration of foreigners who wish to
stay, but also encourage the return of those who can be persuaded to leave.  In
this context, integration is usually thought of as foreigners accepting and
adopting German customs.  Sen and many Germans argue that foreigners settled in
Germany should be allowed to have dual citizenship, so that they can
participate in German political life, and be taken seriously by politicians,
and not have to appear disloyal to their countries of origin, or give up the
right to inherit property or invest on favorable terms there.  However, the
current Kohl government has expressed opposition to dual citizenship.<p>

<p>
According to the 1990 Census of Population, foreign-born persons were eight
percent of the US population and 10 percent of the households receiving public
assistance payments, but they received 13 percent of all cash assistance
payments from programs such as AFDC and SSI, reflecting larger immigrant
families.  The typical household headed by a native-born person on welfare
received $4,000 in cash benefits in 1989, versus $5,400 by households getting
cash assistance whose heads were foreign-born.  <p>
<p>
The percentage of families receiving cash assistance and headed by a
foreign-born person varied by country of origin:  it was highest for persons
from Southeast Asia, about 11 to 12 percent for immigrants from Mexico, and two
to four percent for persons from East Asia.  For immigrants from most
countries, the percentage of families receiving cash assistance has been
rising--about 30 percent of the households headed by immigrants from the
Dominican Republic are receiving cash assistance even after 10 years in the
US.<p>

Clark, Rebecca et.al. 1994.  Fiscal Impacts of Undocumented Aliens:  Selected
Estimates for Seven States.  Available from the Urban Institute, 2100 M St,
Washington, DC, 20037.  September.<p>
<p>
This study was conducted at the request of the Office of Management and Budget
and Department of Justice to examine the fiscal effects of unauthorized or
illegal aliens in seven states--California, Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois.
Arizona, and New Jersy.  Estimates were developed for three types of costs
incurred to provide services to illegal aliens--incarceration, elementary and
secondary education, and emergency medical services--and the federal, state,
and local taxes paid by these aliens.<p>
<p>
Based on INS estimates (MN, May, 1994), the Urban Institute estimated that
there were 3.4 million illegal aliens in the US in October 1992, and 86 percent
were in the seven-study states.  As of March 1994, the Urban Institute
estimated that 21,395 illegal aliens were incarcerated in the seven states at a
cost of $471 million per year or an average annual cost to the states of
$22,000 each; 641,000 illegal alien pupils enrolled in public schools at a cost
of $3.1 billion or $4,800 each; and $445 million was spent on Medicaid for a
presumed 3.2 million unauthorized aliens in 1993, or $1,400 each--the number of
unauthorized aliens is estimated to increase by 300,000 per year, and 86
percent are in these seven states. <p>
<p>
The taxes paid by unauthorized aliens to state and local governments were
estimated indirectly to be $1.9 billion.  These taxes included 59 percent from
sales taxes, 37 percent from property taxes, and five percent from state income
taxes.<p>

The October 17, 1994 Issue of The Nation includes four immigration articles.
David Cole challenges what he asserts are five immigration myths; Leslie Silko
attacks the Border Patrol's interior check points on Southwestern highways;
Elizabeth Kadetsky discusses the supporters of California's Proposition 187,
asserting that its chief authors, Harold Ezell and Alan Nelson, have distanced
themselves both from the SOS organization and from FAIR; and Peter Kwong
reports on a visit to Wenzhou in southeastern China, to explore reasons why
young Chinese are willing to pay $1,500 down, and borrow the remaining $30,000
necessary to be smuggled to the U.S. and then work in sweatshops to pay off
their debts - the major reasons seem to be competition and corruption in China
that prevent rural industries from being profitable, and knowledge that some of
those smuggled to the U.S. have been successful, as evidenced by the
remittances they send back.<p>

This monograph includes four articles on Canada's multiculturalist policies,
and an overview of US immigration policies.  Some of the German participants in
the seminars at which these papers were presented were surprised to learn that
immigration and integration are just as hotly debated in classical or
traditional countries of immigration as in the "new" immigration countries of
Europe.<p>
