<p><i>The following is the full text of a letter which appeared, 
abridged, in the Wednesday, Dec. 18 New York Times. It is a 
response to a vicious, FBI-like anti-Communist op-ed on Dec. 
10 which slandered the Communist Party's 77-year history of 
fighting for civil rights.</i></p>

<p>J. Edgar Hoover must be smiling from his grave. W.E.B. Du 
Bois must be turning in his.</p>

<p>Hoover, because the stench of the McCarthyism he helped 
create continues to foul the op-ed page of the New York 
Times. Du Bois, because opportunists continue to abuse the 
name and legacy of the organization he helped found.</p>

<p>Denton L. Watson's article on Thurgood Marshall is straight 
out of Hoover's McCarthyite Cold War propaganda machine - 
straight out of the gutter. The Communist Party 
"embarrassed" the NAACP during the Scottsboro case; 
organized African Americans as a "fifth column;" "used 
women" to seduce unsuspecting Blacks; Communists, not 
racists, were the "greatest threat" to the NAACP?</p>

<p>Echoes of McCarthy? This is demagogy that rivals, if not 
exceeds, the Big Lie of McCarthyism during the 1950s. That 
it appears in the New York Times in 1996 gives reason for 
pause.</p>

<p>One need not respond to the garbage, but to set the record 
straight: Socialism and Communism are not foreign imports 
but are home-grown American products. The lives and 
political legacies of figures like W.E.B. Du Bois and Mary 
Wright Ovington - both life-long advocates of socialism and 
founders of the NAACP - amply testify to this.</p>

<p>During the 77 years of the CPUSA, Communists worked side by 
side with many organizations in trade unions and civil 
rights organizations and, yes, with the NAACP for jobs, 
peace, against racism and for social equality.</p>

<p>That white people and African Americans - including Du Bois 
- joined the Communist Party was no crime. Nor was it the 
result of some hidden plot. Rather, people joined the Party 
because of their admiration of its work against racism and 
for the rights of workers, Black, Brown and white. Du Bois 
himself dismissed the conspiracy charge. "I reject the 
charge that Communism is a conspiracy," he said when joining 
the Communist Party.</p>

<p>It was the rabid anti-Communist hysteria of McCarthyism, 
falsely charging the Communist movement with conspiracies 
and plots, that led to the Smith Act trials for conspiring 
to "think" and "teach" - charges that many of us went to 
jail for.</p>

<p>We wonder at the publication of such patently false 
allegations today. We remember that Big Lie anti-Communism 
has always been the foundation of fascist-like thinking. Let 
all democratic-minded people be warned: this demagogy, if 
left unanswered, threatens democracy itself - it is the 
stuff of fascism.</p>

<p>We close with the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 
spoken when memorializing Dr. Du Bois in 1968 just weeks 
before King's assassination. Observing that Du Bois was a 
genius who chose to be a Communist, he said, "Irrational, 
obsessive anti-Communism has led us into too many quagmires 
to be retained as if it were a mode of scientific thinking."</p>
