<p>
        In order to being our discussion of the 10th criteria, that is, the 
notion of exportability being granted only to those products whose keys are 
escrowed with a government "approved" escrow agent, we must first make an 
exhaustive review of the current requirements for domestic or international 
key escrow agent operation:
 <p>
<i>Ken showed a blank slide and paused.

<p>
Now that we've done that, let's move on.  

<p>
        It is against this backdrop of good, solid regulatory precedent that 
we must decide what the government's third party agent regulations should be 
-- or whether there should be any at all...

<p>
        As we discuss the desirable characteristics of potential third party 
agents, it is essential that we remember that we are discussing the 
relationship between Domestic Third Party Agent regulations and the 
exportability of encryption products.  While nobody is suggesting that 
strictly domestic activities be regulated, there is one overriding 
consideration for industry....

<p>
        Public confidence in any key escrow system is ESSENTIAL for its 
success.  It is not in anyone's best interest - not even industry's - for 
known criminals to be third party agents, or for law enforcement to be unable 
to do its job....

<p>
        In the absence of government imposed regulations, industry has every 
incentive create its own rules to maintain the society's confidence in the 
integrity of the system....

<p>
        We are entering uncharted territory here.  Whenever new, dynamic and 
useful industries are created, people think of new and ever more creative ways 
to sue one another.  With all of the potential liability lurking about out 
there, companies that provide third party agent technology are going to make 
every reasonable effort to ensure those entities that choose to act as third 
party agents are not going to expose them to unreasonable liability.  These 
providers are going to find it necessary to compile certain basic information 
about the potential third party agents.  --both to show they have acted 
reasonably, and to maintain system integrity.--    However, this need must be 
balanced with the commercial reality that asking too much of potential key 
escrow agents is commercially undesirable.....

<p>
        TIS thought it might be nice to require the same information from 
potential third party agents that the State Department requires from those who 
register to export Firearms, Tanks and Military Vehicles.  Accordingly, we 
offer a possible solution....

<p>
<i>

exports of munitions.

<p>
        This slide is a sample Department of State application for 
registration to be a munitions exporter.  It is not terribly onerous to 
complete.  We believe it is not unreasonable for providers of third party 
agent technology to require this information from their prospective licensees 
in the ordinary course of business, and perhaps even some additional 
information regarding an
individual who can be contacted in the event of an emergency.   Good business 
practice might also require a favorable credit rating and a certificate of 
good standing from the state of incorporation.  These are things industry can 
do on its own -- without having to wait for a lengthy, and unreliable, 
legislative outcome.

<p>
        From our perspective, we would have no problem telling prospective 
third party agents that we are collecting this information for our own 
purposes, but that we would make it available to law enforcement upon request. 
 If they refuse to provide the information, we would refuse to sell them the 
technology.....

<p>
        If we require industry to wait for legislation to have "approved" 
escrow agents, the people in charge of granting export approval for encryption 
products will make Maytag repairmen look like party animals.  Industry can, 
and will, compile the information necessary to protect itself, and assist law 
enforcement when it is appropriate to do so.  

<p>
Thank you.
