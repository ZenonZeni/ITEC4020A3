<P>
The CRC for Industrial Plant Biopolymers was established in 1992 to develop the science and technological base for the manufacture of biopolymers such as gums, thickeners and stabilisers. These are used in a large range of industries including food manufacturing, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, paints, ceramics and oil drilling. A major aim is to develop a commercial process to produce biopolymers using plant cell culture.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Biopolymers are molecules composed mainly of carbohydrates with some protein. Most commercial biopolymers are obtained from tree exudates, seeds and seaweeds. Their availability and performance are unreliable. Plant cell culture offers the potential to produce similar biopolymers of consistently high quality and function. The centre's research groups are:
<UL>
<LI>analysing the relationship between structure and function;
<LI>developing reliable emulsification, formation and evaluation protocols for biopolymers used in consumer products;
<LI>screening of plant cells to produce chemicals with commercial utility;
<LI>screening of Australian red seaweeds for commercially valuable agars and carrageens; and
<LI>cloning commercially important genes which have the potential to increase the productivity of cells producing biopolymers.
</UL>
A well-equipped testing facility has been established at the University of Melbourne to facilitate the relationship between industry and the CRC.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Plant cell culture technology has been developed to produce biopolymers at a pilot plant scale in conjunction with the commercial participants.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The Australian market for biopolymers, used in foods, pet foods, cosmetics and other manufactured products is worth $20 million a year. The international market exceeds $1 billion a year.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Victoria is a centre for many industries in which biopolymers are commonly used. Three of the four CRC research nodes are located in Melbourne together with the centre's core commercial participants. The Melbourne groups have research expertise in plant cell culture, genetic engineering, seaweed taxonomy and other important biotechnological processes.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The centre has expertise to solve problems commonly experienced by industry in the application of biopolymers. The centre is keen to undertake projects of this nature which assist the competitiveness of Australian industry.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
$12.4 million over five years from the Australian Government and $13 million from the core participants.
