<H2>Crisis Care for the Child or Adolescent With a Neurobiological Disorder</H2>
 <HR>
If severely ill and in risk of injuring himself or someone else, your child may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital or a residential treatment program.  
<P>
As the child's parent or guardian, you should expect to be part of the treatment plan, be told of all changes in medication and therapy plans, and, take part in the discharge plan.  
<P>
Generally, hospitalization for children and adolescents is brief.  Make sure that you know what alternative schooling programs are available and most appropriate for your child when he or she is discharged, especially if he or she is unable to return to his regular school program.
<P>
How do I pay for services for my child?
<P>
Mental health services, such as therapy, may be covered by your insurance plan.  Look at the mental health section of your plan to see what services it covers.  Many HMOs now require a gatekeeper other than a primary care physician be involved in determining whether mental health services will be provided.  If you, or your child is currently covered by a Medicaid program, some mental health services may be available.  Find out more about insurance plans and Medicaid from your local AMI or AMI-CAN affiliate.  
<P>
While hospitalized, special education programs mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) are paid for under a set formula of county, state, and federal dollars.
<P>
I am told I must give up custody of my child because I cannot pay for services.
<P>
Some states require this; others do not.  The problem is how states interpret the law.  Treatment providers, as well as state child welfare authorities often explain that relinquishment is required by the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (also known as P. L 96-272, or Title IV-E of the Social Security Act) or that treatment needs are best served if parents do not have the authority to remove their children from a treatment setting.  
<P>
In fact, such relinquishment is not required by federal law.
<P>
What do I do if I am not satisfied with a professional or a program where my child is placed for treatment or educational services?
<P>
Try to learn all you can about what the program or professional is supposed to do so you can judge carefully whether or not it's the right place or person to help your child.  If you are not satisfied, you need to express specifically what your concerns are.  You may need to seek a second opinion.  Learn about the laws that protect you and your child.  Speak up.  Ask questions.  Join an advocacy organization such as your local AMI and AMI-CAN that seeks better services in your community.
<P>
But most importantly, don't give up; your child needs your persistence.  Now, more than ever before, there are appropriate placements in schools.  If faced with serious unresolved concerns, you may need to consult a special-education lawyer to get the services your child needs.
<P>
Where can I find a support group of families whose children have neurobiological disorders?
<P>
Contact your local AMI affiliate.  (There are more than 1,000 affiliates throughout the U.S.)  They will tell you whether a child and adolescent group has formed in your area and where local support groups meet.  If you would like to form a support group for parents of children and adolescents, write to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) and ask for the children and adolescent start-up packet.  This kit will enable you to start a group in your community as well as provide resource lists and ideas about advocating for the services you may need.
<P>
What are the advocacy goals of these groups?
<P>
Young families with children with neurobiological disorders are already advocating at all levels of government for improved services and access to services for children and adolescents.  The goals of advocacy include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a total range of individualized and appropriate educational, treatment, and rehabilitative services;
<LI>a comprehensive, community-based system of care available to every child and adolescent in need of such services;
<LI>an end to the practice of forcing parents to give up custody of their children to obtain needed services;
<LI>the rights of children and adolescents to a free, appropriate public education and related services as mandated by federal, state, and local laws;
<LI>a change in public policy so that the needs of children and adolescents with neurobiological disorders are placed among the top priorities of the nation;
<LI>full family participation in planning for education and treatment;
<LI>full equity for children and adolescents with these disorders in the nation's healthcare and insurance systems;
<LI>research into causes, improved treatments, prevention, and cures for neurobiological disorders;
<LI>research into the most effective educational strategies, and improvement in the transition between adolescent and adult services.
