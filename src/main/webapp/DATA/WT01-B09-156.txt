Performing Organization: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division </B><p>

<P>Technical POC: John Inman, (812) 854­2161</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>RA­93 Crash, Fire and Rescue Training Course: Course was intended to provide guidance to
operators and rescue personnel in the event of an accident. A draft of the course has been completed. Final
production is currently on hold as more information is gathered. The crash testing of one Electricore electric pickup
was documented with the intent of using this information in this course. Other crash and safety test results
consortia­wide will also be included. Driver certification was conducted at each user site so as to insure proper
operation of the vehicles. These training sessions were conducted in the summer of 1995 for the electric pickup
trucks. Further training will be provided as Electricore's hybrid electric buses are fielded. Driver certification and
training is done in conjunction with the perspective vehicle manufacturer. </P>
