<A NAME="bean"></A><H2>Beans + bacteria=nitrogen for your garden</H2>
<P>Beans and others members of the legume family are nature's subtle way of supplying nitrogen to the vegetable garden. Working with specialized bacteria known as rhizobia, legumes convert pure nitrogen in the atmosphere to an ammonia form that is immediately available in the soil. With sufficient rhizobia, legumes will produce a reserve of nitrogen that will be available for a succeeding crop. </P>
<P>Each kind of legume­ vegetables such as beans and  peas, and cover crops such as clover and vetch‹respond best to different species of rhizobia. You can ask at your local garden center for rhizobia innoculant for each specific crop, or use a general purpose innoculant. Another option, which the editors of the Dirt shamelessly promote, is to add copious amounts of high-quality compost, which is naturally full of rhizobia and other beneficial microbes, as well as the phosphorus necessary for good root growth and flower production. </P>
<A NAME="corn"></A><H2>The origins of Corn</H2>
<P>Corn has been raised in North America for over 800 years.  Bred from wild grasses, it was developed by Mesoamerican farmers around 7000 years ago, probably in Mexico.  As aboriginal farmers spread north and south, new strains of Zea mays or maize (as corn is known) were selected to adapt to different soils, pests, moisture levels and growing seasons. </P>
<P>Today, modern high-yield hybrids have replaced the traditional varieties. </P>
Corn is totally dependent upon humans for its continued existence.  If humans were to stop planting and harvesting corn,  it would disappear.  As one scientist reports in a recent article in Smithsonian (November 1995), "Corn's seeds, the kernels, grow embedded in cobs.  The stay pressed together when the cob falls to the ground, inhibiting one another's growth.  ŒOver time, reproduction stops.  The only reason we have corn today is that for thousands of years humans have selected seeds and planted them." </P>

<P>We are as dependent on the ancient varieties of corn today as our forebears were hundreds of years ago.  Why?  We depend on the genetic diversity of the maize plants of the ancients to provide stability to the modern agricultural corn field.  In fact, in 1970 an outbreak of Southern corn leaf blight killed 15 percent of the U.S. corn crop, reminding us of how fragile are the monocultures upon which we depend for our food. </P>



<A NAME="sister"></A><H2>The Three Sisters</H2>
<P>Ancient farmers in the Americas practiced a unique form of intercropping known as the "Three Sisters."  For example, in upstate New York, the Iroquois used a variation of this system to produce crops for over 400 years.  The ancient farmers would girdle the trees in a field.  After the trees had died, they would burn the field using the ash as a fertilizer.  A few kernels of corn would be planted in a hole.  After the corn sprouted, the area would be weeded and the soil mounded up around the young corn stalks.  Two weeks or so after they planted the corn, the Iroquois farmers would then plant two or three bean seeds.  Between the corn and bean "mounds" they would also plant pumpkins or other squash. </P>
<P>As the plants grew, these Three Sisters worked together.  The broad leaves of the squash plants shaded the soil and suppressed weeds.  Bacteria living in the roots of the beans converted atmospheric nitrogen into a form that the plants could use.  The corn provided the beans with a framework to grow on.
At harvest, the Iroquois farmers would leave the debris in the fields to enrich the soil.  As the bean plants rotted, the soil was enriched with nitrogen.  The following season, the mounds were replanted using the same system.  As the fields became worn with time, the planting area was moved and the old ground allowed to regenerate. </P>
<P>When measured in bushels of corn produced the native practices were not as productive as modern agricultural techniques: 25-40 bushels per acre compared to modern yields of over 100 bushels to the acre.  But the Iroquois did not raise corn alone.  When the combined output of the corn, beans, and squash are measured by comparing the overall caloric production, the traditional system produces over 4.02 million calories per acre as compared to the modern cornfield's production of only 3.44 million calories per acre.  That modern number is further reduced when one factors in the caloric content of the fuels, fertilizers, and pesticides required to produce a bushel of corn in the modern world.</P>
