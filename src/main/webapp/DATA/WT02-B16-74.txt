<b><i>A Letter From <br>
The Secretary Of Energy</b></i>
<p>
The National campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is not
just an environmental mission.  Energy efficiency and renewable
energy are economic "wins" for participants in "Energy Partnerships
for a Strong Economy:  A Better Climate for Jobs."
<p>
Business, industry, States, local communities and consumers benefit
from new job opportunities; more affordable housing; cleaner air;
and a sustainable, and therefore stable, economic base of business
and industry.  Citizens benefit from redirection of 
their tax dollars into reduced energy costs.  Industries enjoy new
cost savings, smaller energy bills and renewed viability through
the direct and indirect benefits of emerging technologies and the
jobs they create.  And yes, America's children will enjoy
 a cleaner environment.
<p>
DOE's "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" is not a new
bureaucracy.  It is a fresh, innovative approach to environmental
quality and economic growth designed to leverage Federal dollars
through partnerships with private industry. These activities 
do not duplicate, but rather incorporate, existing State and
Federal programs and accelerate their benefits.
<p>
Above all, "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" is flexible
enough to meet the needs of our diverse Nation, while focused
enough to achieve America's economic and environmental goals.
<p>
Whether you are a large corporation, a small business, or a town or
county, DOE can provide you with more information on a range of
actions that make economic and environmental sense.

<p>
If you have a question, an idea, a comment, or want to participate,
call us at <b>1-800-DOE-EREC.</b>
<p>
Sincerely,<p>

Hazel O'Leary<p>
Secretary of Energy

<hr><b><A NAME="ref1">Introduction</b></a><p>
Welcome to a new era of unprecedented public/private cooperation. 
<p>
At the U.S. Department of Energy, we call our activities "Energy
Partnerships for a Strong Economy," and we mean every single word
of it. 
<p>
Under a strong commitment to energy efficiency, renewable energy
and environmental stewardship, programs are co-created by the
partners themselves. 
<p>
It is business, industry and government working together.
<p>
Why participate?  Because energy efficiency and renewable energy
save money and the environment.
<p>
This collaboration is flexible and responsive.  It accelerates the
implementation of energy initiatives mandated by Congress in the
Energy Policy Act of 1992.  And it's profitable.
<p>
Our goal is sustainable economic development, including:
<ul>
<LI>       greater productivity, 
<LI>       increased competitiveness and 
<LI>       higher profits,<p> 
</ul>
all accomplished while protecting the environment through energy
efficiency and the use of renewable energy. 
<p>
You'll find that energy efficiency and renewable energy are often
the cleanest and least expensive ways to obtain energy -  and they
strengthen the national economy, too.  Energy efficiency activities
implemented from 1973 to 1986 are today saving America
n consumers $225 billion annually!
<p>
Today's new energy technology gives us the opportunity to make even
greater strides.  The American Council for an Energy Efficient
Economy estimates that national energy use could be cut in half
from our 1988 levels by the year 2030 -  saving $2.3 trillio
n and reducing carbon emissions by 70%.
<p>
Take a moment to review the programs outlined in this guidebook.
<p>
You'll learn how these national benefits extend to your bottom
line.  You'll discover that there are partnerships for everyone
from utility companies to small businesses; from financial
institutions to commercial and residential builders, owners and
mana
gers; from state and local governments to environmental
organizations and other advocacy groups. 
<p>
If you find a program you'd like to participate in, or have one you
would like to create, call us at <b>1-800-DOE-EREC.<p></b>

<hr><h1><i><A NAME="ref2">Commercial</h1></i></a><p>
<i>A national fast-food chain recently redesigned its retail outlets,
putting more windows in front and removing an eave.  Unfortunately,
the changes caused the restaurants to overheat, particularly when
the front of the building was oriented toward the sun
.  The Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory
teamed with a heating and cooling contractor and the chain's
facilities manager to audit the new design.  Based on the team's
recommendations, the chain is using more efficient heating an
d cooling systems and reducing its window area. These changes are
expected to cut heating and cooling costs by 30% in each building.</i>
<p>
Consuming 11% of the nation's energy, commercial buildings offer
significant opportunities to save energy and prevent energy-related
pollution.  Heating and cooling systems, lighting and engineering
systems in commercial and multi-family residential buil
dings are all targets for new energy-saving technologies.  The
"Energy Partnerships" initiative hits these targets with:
<p>
<ul>
<LI>       Financial and technical help for community and regional
partnerships that promote commercial efficiency.        
<LI>       Financial and technical assistance to partnerships between
manufacturers, utilities and others to develop and market
high-efficiency equipment.
<LI>       Competitive grants and training to help States update their
commercial building codes.
<p>
<p>
</ul>
<p><A HREF="#toc">Partnership Guide Table of Contents</A><p>
<hr><b><A NAME="ref3">Rebuild America</b></a><p>
<b>Goal</b><p>
Improve the energy efficiency of existing commercial and
multi-family buildings.<p>
<b>Approach</b><p>
Form public/private partnerships that accelerate energy efficiency
improvements to commercial and multi-family buildings. 
Promote wide-scale energy efficiency improvements through
established community and regional organizations involved in
building management, renovation and energy service. 
Provide financial and technical help for new efforts that improve
and accelerate building renovation programs.  <p>
<b>Benefits</b><p>
<i>More cash:</i>  Lower operating expenses lead to increased cash flow
for building owners.<p>
<i>Greater economic growth:</i>  Lower energy costs free up cash for
spending on other goods and services, leading to new jobs. <p>
<i>Better marketability:</i>  Properties are more 
attractive to potential tenants.<p>
<i>Increased pride:</i>  Building revitalization improves the business
climate and community pride. <p>
<i>Quality of life:</i>  Upgraded buildings increase comfort and
productivity.<p>

<hr><b><A NAME="ref4"> High-Efficiency Commercial Equipment</a></b><p>
<b>Goal</b><p>
Increase development and sales of high-
efficiency commercial gas and electric building equipment for water
heating, space heating and cooling, refrigeration, lighting and
dishwashing.<p>
<b>Approach</b><p>
Eliminate market barriers to the manufacture and use of
high-efficiency building equipment.  Approaches include:<p>
Partnerships:  Form partnerships among manufacturers, installers,
retailers and bulk buyers to cut production costs and provide
minimum sales volumes.<p>
Performance:  Initiate performance testing, rating, certification
and labeling for new equipment.<p>
Infrastructure:  Improve the sales, installation and servicing
infrastructure for high-efficiency equipment.<p>
Education:  Promote consumer and contractor information and
education.<p>
<b>Benefits</b><p>
<i>Reduced energy costs:</i>  Energy costs are cut 50% in many commercial
buildings with cost-effective improvements to lighting, space
conditioning systems and building controls. Even greater savings
result from efficiency improvements to other building equipm
ent.  The bottom line: lower overhead and higher profits.<p>
<i>Higher sales:</i>  Manufacturers gain new markets -  leading to higher
sales. <p>
