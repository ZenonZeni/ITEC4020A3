JUDGE POINTER APPROVES
NEW GLOBAL SETTLEMENT;
FIVE PLAINTIFFS OBJECT

     Five plaintiffs in the Lindsey class action on Jan. 9 filed
a motion for reconsideration with the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama, following Judge Sam C. Pointer
Jr.'s Dec. 22 order approving the revised global settlement of
breast implant claims.  In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants
Products Liability Litigation, No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-
10000-S (ND AL); Lindsey et al. v. Dow Corning Corp. et al.,
No. CV 94-P-11558-S; see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter,
Nov. 28, 1995.

     The plaintiffs contend that Order No. 27 is void on
procedural grounds and violates the plaintiffs' substantive legal
rights.

     The original $4.2 billion global settlement, approved by
Judge Pointer in 1994, collapsed when many more women than
expected sought benefits.  The new settlement, which includes
defendants Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter Healthcare, Minnesota
Mining & Manufacturing, McGhan Medical Corp. and Union Carbide,
calls for lower payments and includes more restrictive criteria
that claimants must meet to qualify for benefits.  However, the
payment levels set forth in the new settlement will not be
affected by the number of women who seek benefits.

     Under the new agreement, eligible participants are domestic
class members who have had at least one implant manufactured or
distributed by one of the settling defendants or their
predecessors or subsidiaries.  There are no provisions for
foreign claimants under the settlement, nor are children of
implant recipients eligible to participate with regard to their
own personal injury claims.  Claimants who previously opted out
of the original settlement have until Dec. 16, 1996, to withdraw
their exclusion and to register with the Claims Office.

     In his order, Judge Pointer said, "The Court concludes that,
for eligible participants, this revised settlement program
reduces the amount of 'ratcheting' that would otherwise occur
under terms of the Settlement and that, for persons not eligible
to participate, it preserves their rights under the Settlement to
opt out and, indeed, by providing some options to continue and
extend the suspension of statutes of limitation and repose, it
partially enhances those rights."

     In a separate order also issued Dec. 22, Judge Pointer
approved a question-and-answer booklet and list of implant brand
names that will be distributed as part of the notice program to
all claimants who have given their names and addresses to the
court, whether they are currently members of the Lindsey class or
have opted out of the original settlement.

     The five plaintiffs seeking to overturn the order are
Christina Johanna Adelaar, Johanna Maria Jagt-Hamerslag, Kathy
Lambert, Maria Engelhart-Nelissen and Nancy Pulcini.  According
to the motion, four are citizens of foreign countries and are not
eligible for benefits under the revised settlement, and the fifth
is a member of the Lindsey class who claims she will be prevented
from obtaining a prompt settlement of her claims if she opts out.

     The plaintiffs object that Judge Pointer issued the order
sua sponte, without a motion by any party, contrary to Rule 60(b)
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Further, the plaintiffs
assert, they are entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the
1994 order approving the global settlement is revised or vacated.
Finally, they argue, Order No. 27 is void because appeals from
the 1994 order are before the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals,
which must grant leave for the order to be modified.

     Order No. 27 violates the Fifth Amendment and equal
protection rights of the foreign plaintiffs, who were eligible
for benefits under the original settlement and who have relied
upon the 1994 order, the plaintiffs say.

     The motion was filed by Sybil Shainwald of the Law Offices
of Sybil Shainwald in New York City.

DOW CHEMICAL'S MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION IS
DENIED BY JUDGE POINTER

     Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr.'s order denying Dow Chemical's
motion for summary judgment on claims that it should be held
liable for alleged illnesses caused by Dow Corning's manufacture
of silicone gel breast implants will stand, the judge ruled in a
Dec. 26 order denying Dow's motion for reconsideration.  In re
Silicone Gel Breast Implants Products Liability Litigation,
No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-10000-S (ND AL); see Breast
Implant Litigation Reporter, Aug. 8, 1995.

     Judge Pointer originally granted Dow Chemical's motion,
saying that the company had no special knowledge of alleged
hazards of Dow Corning's implants that would obligate Dow
Chemical to warn end users of the implants.  Dow Chemical and
Corning, Inc. are the sole shareholders of Dow Corning.

     However, Judge Pointer later vacated that order, finding new
evidence of Dow Chemical's involvement in the testing of
silicones that Dow Corning used in implant products.  Dow
Chemical sought reconsideration, contending that it performed
only two tests on a silicone compound for Dow Corning, and that
neither test involved suitability for medical implants.

     In his order, Judge Pointer said his ruling should stand
because there is no new evidence or change in the law that would
warrant vacating it.  He rejected Dow Chemical's claims that the
issue should be whether Dow Chemical specifically tested breast
implants, not just raw silicone, and that holding Dow Chemical
liable would violate public policy.

COURT DISMISSES SEVEN
CANADIAN SUITS FOR
FORUM NON CONVENIENS

     Seven suits filed in the United States by Canadian women who
received breast implants in Canada were dismissed Dec. 26 from
the multidistrict litigation in Alabama on the basis of forum non
conveniens.  In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants Products
Liability Litigation, No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-10000-S
(ND AL).

     U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. cited the reasons
given in his April 25, 1995, order dismissing nearly all cases
filed by foreign plaintiffs, including two suits filed by
Canadian citizens (see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter,
April 28, 1995).

     The seven suits are: Ellis et al. v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.
et al., No. CV 93-P-14114-S; Pollyck et al. v. Baxter Healthcare
Corp. et al., No. CV 94-P-14115-S; Davis et al. v. Baxter
Healthcare Corp. et al., No. CV 93-P-14408-S; Martin et al. v.
Baxter Healthcare Corp. et al., No. CV 93-P-14409-S; Walker v.
McGhan Medical Corp., No. CV-94-P-10521-S; Chapin v. McGhan
Medical Corp et al., No. CV 94-P-11335-S; and two plaintiffs from
McIver et al. v. Dow Corning Corp. et al., No. CV 94-P-14600-S.
The suits were initially filed in Texas state court, removed to
federal court and ultimately transferred to the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama, which is overseeing
all federal breast implant litigation.

     In his April 25 order, Judge Pointer found that foreign
claimants from Canada, Australia and England have adequate
remedies available to them in their own court systems, and
therefore may not file suit in the United States.

     Judge Pointer's most recent order contains the same
conditions as the April 25 order with respect to the defendants,
namely that:

     " Each defendant will submit to jurisdiction in Canada and
accept service of process there;

     " Each defendant will be bound to pay any final judgment
against it;

     " If raising a statute of limitations defense, the
defendants will not include the period the suit was pending in
the United States; and

     " The defendants will not object to offered evidence that
would be admissible in a U.S. court.

     Judge Pointer also said his order is without prejudice to
plaintiffs filing proofs of claim in the Dow Corning bankruptcy.

DOW DEFENDANTS, 3M
FILE REPLY BRIEFS
WITH SIXTH CIRCUIT

     Transfer of cases against Dow Corning's shareholders, Dow
Chemical and Corning Inc., to the Eastern District of Michigan
will not bring breast implant litigation against the shareholders
to a grinding halt as breast implant plaintiffs claim, Dow
Corning and the shareholders told the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in a Dec. 11 reply brief.  In re Dow Corning Corp.;
Lindsey v. O'Brien, Tanski, Tanser and Young et al., Nos. 95-
2034, 95-2106, 95-2082, 95-2084, and 95-2107 (6th Cir.); see
Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.

     In a separate brief, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
contended that the appellees are raising "red herring" issues to
confuse the court into ignoring the substantive issues.

     Earlier, the law firm of O'Quinn, Kerensky, McAninch &
Laminack, representing some 2,000 women who have opted out of the
global settlement of breast implant claims, argued that Dow
Corning Corp. is using a ruse to get cases against its non-
bankrupt parents transferred to the Eastern District of
Michigan.

     In a separate brief, the firm argues that 3M, Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. and Baxter Healthcare Corp. are not entitled to have
their cases transferred.

     Dow Corning Corp., one of the numerous defendants named in
breast implant lawsuits, filed for bankruptcy protection last May
in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
and sought transfer of the cases against it to the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Co-defendants named
in lawsuits with Dow Corning also sought transfer, arguing that
their cases are "related to" the Dow Corning bankruptcy.  U.S.
District Judge Denise Page Hood ruled on Sept. 12 that her court
does not have jurisdiction over breast implant claims against
nondebtor defendants.  The manufacturers appealed to the Sixth
Circuit.

     "Dow Chemical and Corning, Inc., not being in bankruptcy,
had no right to the benefits of the bankruptcy procedures," the
plaintiffs argue.  "Their lawyers, knowing this, filed no motion
to transfer because as non-bankrupt companies they had no
standing to file such a motion.  Thus, they got their subsidiary,
Dow Corning, to do it for them.  This ruse should not work.
These efforts to smuggle a transfer order for Dow Chemical and
Corning, Inc., should be rejected for the same reasons that the
motions to transfer filed by Bristol, Baxter and 3M should be
rejected."

     Responding to the arguments of 3M, Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Baxter, the plaintiffs contend that these companies are seeking
unprecedented court action that has never been allowed in any
mass tort bankruptcy case, including the asbestos-related
bankruptcies and the bankruptcy of intrauterine device maker A.H.
Robins.

     In addition, the plaintiffs contend, the companies' appeals
can be interpreted as seeking relief they never requested from
Judge Hood " the transfer of all breast implant cases against
them, not only cases in which Dow Corning is a co-defendant.

     Finally, the plaintiffs contend the manufacturers are
improperly seeking de novo review of Judge Hood's decision,
ignoring their burden of showing that Judge Hood's factual
findings were clearly erroneous.

SIXTH CIRCUIT BRIEFS, PART II

     Dow Corning, Dow Chemical and Corning Inc., in their reply
brief, reiterate their argument that transfer is necessary so
that claims against Dow Corning and the shareholders can be kept
together and pretrial proceedings can take place in an organized
and efficient manner.  Transfer is not an attempt to shield Dow
Chemical and Corning from tort liability, they argue.

     Responding to arguments raised by a group of California
plaintiffs, the Dow defendants argued that Judge Hood did not "
as the plaintiffs claim " remand the cases to state court
herself, but she merely advised the various federal courts to do
so when the cases returned to them.  For that reason, they also
found fault with the California plaintiffs' argument that the
appeals court lacks jurisdiction because orders remanding cases
to state courts are not appealable.

     Finally, Dow Chemical and Corning contend that, contrary to
appellees' arguments, they have standing to appeal.

     3M, in its reply brief, contends that the appellees are
attempting to divert the court's attention from the real issues
with arguments that transfer is a ruse to thwart breast implant
claims.  It is the plaintiffs' bar, not the nondebtor defendants,
who are trying to take "improper tactical advantage " of the Dow
Corning bankruptcy, 3M asserts.

     "Appellees' arguments on this appeal are further belied by
one inescapable fact " it was the plaintiffs' bar that filed
actions naming the Nondebtor Manufacturers and DCC as joint
tortfeasors in the breast implant lawsuits," 3M states.  "It was
the plaintiffs' bar that pursued the tactic of suing all of the
Manufacturers jointly and severally, asserting in many cases that
women had received implants from multiple manufacturers and that
the Manufacturers had allegedly conspired to withhold from women
information concerning the alleged health risks of such implants.
It is thus remarkable that Appellees now argue that the breast
implant claims they chose to assert against the Nondebtor
Manufacturers and DCC on a theory of joint and several liability
have somehow become unrelated cases that should be tried
separately now that DCC is in reorganization."

     The plaintiffs' briefs were filed by John M. O'Quinn,
Richard N. Laminack and Thomas W. Pirtle of O'Quinn, Kerensky,
McAninch & Laminack in Houston.

     3M is represented by Bruce R. Zirinsky and Greg A. Danilow
of Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York City; and by Richard A.

DCC SETTLES WITH HMR,
DOW CHEMICAL; ASKS
COURT TO OK AGREEMENT

     Dow Corning Corp. on Dec. 27 asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Bay City, MI, to approve a settlement it reached with Hoechst
Marion Roussel (HMR) and Dow Chemical Co. that would resolve
HMR's objections to the debtor's proposed settlements with
numerous insurance companies over coverage for breast implant
claims.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.);
see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.

     Hearings on the insurance settlements were conducted on
several dates in early December, but were continued pending
approval of the settlement with HMR and Dow Chemical.

     Dow Corning is seeking court approval of settlement
agreements with Zurich Insurance Co. and Zurich International
Ltd.; TIG Insurance Co. and certain other insurers; the London
Market Insurers; National Casualty Co.; Arab Insurance Co.;
Federal Insurance Co.; North River Insurance Co., United States
Fire Insurance Co. and International Surplus Lines Insurance Co.
(the North River Insurers); Algemene Verzekering Maatschappij
Diligentia N.V. Te Amsterdam; and Ludgate Insurance Co.

     HMR and Dow Chemical are named co-insureds on some of the
policies issued by these companies.  They objected to the
proposed settlements, arguing that any disbursements to Dow
Corning would reduce the amount of coverage available to them and
that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to approve
such a settlement.

     Dow Corning says it has reached a settlement that will
resolve the objections of HMR and Dow Chemical.  According to the
Dec. 27 motion, HMR will relinquish any claims to the insurance
policies that compete with Dow Corning's breast implant claims,
in exchange for payments of 2% to 2-1/2% of funds recovered by
Dow Corning or Dow Chemical under the policies.  HMR will also
drop its objections to the pending insurance settlements, as well
as the previously approved Hartford and Royal settlements, which
are now on appeal.

     The settlement between Dow Corning and Dow Chemical calls
for establishment of an escrow fund that will contain the
proceeds of cash settlements between Dow Corning and the insurers
for policies in which Dow Chemical is a co-insured.  The
agreement calls for limits on disbursement of the funds or
determination of rights to the funds until after Dow Corning's
Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is confirmed, and sets the
conditions under which Dow Corning and Dow Chemical can access
the funds to pay claims.

     Dow Corning's motion was filed by Barbara J. Houser, Craig
J. Litherland and David P. McClain of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay in
Dallas.

TORT COMMITTEE SEEKS TO
DISQUALIFY KIRKLAND &
ELLIS AS DCC COUNSEL

     Kirkland & Ellis must be disqualified from representing
debtor Dow Corning Corp. because the firm's simultaneous
representation of Dow Chemical Co., one of Dow Corning's parents,
poses a "significant and unacceptable" conflict of interest, the
Official Committee of Tort Claimants argued Dec. 27 in a motion
filed with the bankruptcy court in Bay City, MI.  In re Dow
Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.).

     The committee says Kirkland & Ellis (K&E) was approved by
the bankruptcy court as special counsel to the debtor under 11
U.S.C. Section 327(e), based in part on its assurance that its
simultaneous representation of Dow Chemical would not be a
conflict of interest.  Now, however, the committee claims,
"recent developments have illustrated that K&E's representations
are no longer correct."

     First, the committee argues, K&E is representing both Dow
Corning and Dow Chemical in the insurance coverage litigation in
the bankruptcy court and in Michigan state court.  The two
companies are attempting to access the same policies, under which
they are co-insureds " Dow Chemical for claims relating to its
Sarabond building material and Dow Corning for breast implant
claims, the committee says.  Allowing one company's claims will
necessarily deplete assets available to the other, the committee
states.

     The committee also notes that the two companies are taking
conflicting positions on liability for breast implant claims: Dow
Corning argues that Dow Chemical should share any liability,
while Dow Chemical contends that Dow Corning alone is
responsible.

     Most recently, the committee states, K&E, in its role as Dow
Chemical's counsel, is preparing to depose Dow Corning employees
whose depositions the firm defended in the breast implant
litigation.

     "The Debtor appears remarkably sanguine about the prospect
of its own principal defense counsel in effect litigating against
it on issues with a potential billion-dollar impact on the
estate," the committee says.  "...Since the Debtor seems
incapable of policing such conflicts, it is appropriate for the
Committee, as fiduciary for significant interests in the estate,
to bring the issue before the Court."

     The Tort Claimants Committee is represented by Alfred S.
Lurey and Dennis S. Meir of Kilpatrick & Cody in Atlanta; Marvin
E. Frankel, Kenneth H. Eckstein and Jeffrey S. Trachtman of
Kramer, Levin, Naftalis, Nessen, Kamin & Frankel in New York
City; and Lenard M. Parkins and Patrick L. Hughes of Verner,
Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand in Houston.

OBJECTIONS FILED
TO PROPOSED MAY 1
BAR DATE

     The Official Committee of Tort Claimants, the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors, Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing Co., Medical Engineering Corp. and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. (the MEC defendants), Baxter Healthcare Corp. and
Baxter International, and several Blue Cross/Blue Shield health
plans all filed responses in the Bay City, MI, bankruptcy court
Dec. 19 and 20 to Dow Corning's proposed bar date of May 1, 1996.
In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.); see Breast
Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 12, 1995.

     Dow Corning on Dec. 1 filed a motion seeking a deadline of
May 1, 1996, for filing proofs of claim against its bankruptcy
estate, and seeking court permission to use claim forms that
differ from the official forms.  In addition, the company filed
its proposed plan to notify all potential creditors and personal
injury claimants of the deadline.

Tort Claimants Committee

     The Tort Claimants Committee contends that a bar date for
breast implant claims will waste assets of Dow Corning's estate
while providing no new or useful information.

     "A bar date for these claims would be expensive, costing
almost $7 million for the Debtor's proposed notice program and
undoubtedly many millions more for the processing and review of
filed claims, and would delay this case for many months," the
committee states.  "A breast implant bar date would improvidently
cut off the claims of many thousands of Breast Implant Recipients
who could far more effectively be reached by notice at a later
and more appropriate stage in the reorganization."

     The value of breast implant claims can be calculated using
currently available information, the committee says.

     Setting a bar date for non-breast implant product liability
claims is also "unwarranted and prejudicial," the committee says.

     "[I]t appears that the principal effect of such a bar date
would be to bar prematurely the great majority of as-yet-
unmatured Other Product Claims, whose holders would have little
incentive in the circumstances to file proofs of claim.  The
problem is compounded by the onerous and intrusive evidentiary
requirements that the Debtor seeks to impose on Other Product
Claimants at the proof of claim stage " the effect of which would
be to deter most claimants from filing."

     Such a scheme violates Bankruptcy Rules 3001(a) and (c),
which require that the official form be used by all creditors,
the committee states.

     The committee also argues that the May 1 date will coincide
with the notice to breast implant claimants regarding the
recently approved revised global settlement, which will result in
confusion and deter women from filing proofs of claim.

     The committee also objects that:

     " no provisions are made for notice to foreign claimants;

     " there are no provisions for maintaining the
     confidentiality of information required to be disclosed on
     the Breast Implant and Other Product claim forms;

     " the Breast Implant claim form does not advise women with
     non-Dow Corning implants that they may have a claim against
     Dow Corning as a supplier of the silicone gel used in the
     implant; and

     " the definition of "Other Products" is vague.

Unsecured Creditors Committee

     Although the committee said it does not object to the idea
of a bar date being set at some point, it said a bar date is not
necessary now and will substantially delay the bankruptcy
proceedings.

     A bar order is neither required for either discharge under
Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code nor for an estimation
proceeding under Section 157(b), the committee argues.

     The committee also objects that the proposed legal
notification program is "totally unwarranted" because other
notice will have to be given in the case " specifically, notice
of the confirmation hearing.  In addition, the committee contends
that Dow Corning has not submitted the actual content of the
notification program for court approval, leaving the court unable
to judge whether the program meets legal standards.

     With respect to the Canadian notification program, the
committee notes that the bankruptcy court does not have power to
enforce the automatic stay outside the borders of the United
States.  The committee, therefore, says the notification to
Canadian claimants should specify that Canadians who file proofs
of claim in the bankruptcy are precluded from pursuing suits in
the Canadian court system, and conversely that pursuing a lawsuit
will prevent participation in the bankruptcy.

     Finally, the committee objected to certain aspects of Dow
Corning's proposed claim forms.

The MEC Defendants

     The MEC defendants complained that although they expect to
file claims against Dow Corning for contribution for cases in
which they are found to be jointly and severally liable, it is
unclear which claim form they are required to file " the Breast
Implant Claim Form or the Commercial Claim Form.

     The MEC defendants also noted the absence of any reference
to potential claims against Dow Corning as a supplier of gel.

     "The MEC Defendants respectfully submit that additional
categories must be added to the Breast Implant Claim Form to
address the Debtor's liabilities arising from the supply of gel,"
they stated.

BAR DATE OBJECTIONS, PART III

     Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing

     3M also objected to Dow Corning's proposed claim form
system, because the proposed forms "do not appropriately or
sufficiently provide for the type and nature of the claims that
3M intends to assert," the company said.

     In addition, 3M argued that the definition of "breast
implant" should be expanded to include all breast implants,
whether manufactured by Dow Corning or another company.  Such a
move is necessary, 3M explained, "in order to address the
universe of claims that have been asserted jointly against DCC
and 3M, including, for example, multiple implant claims and
conspiracy claims."

     3M said it takes no position at this time on the
establishment of the May 1 bar date or on Dow Corning's proposed
notice program.

Baxter Healthcare

     Baxter also seeks modification of the breast implant claim
form to include reference to women who may have claims against
Dow Corning as a gel supplier.

     The form "cannot be fairly completed, much less verified
under penalty of perjury, by (a) a claimant who is unaware of the
identity of her implant manufacturer, (b) a claimant who is
unaware of the identity of the gel supplier or even (c) a
claimant who knows that DCC manufactured the silicone gel
contained in an implant manufactured by another company."

     Baxter also says the notice program should inform women that
non-Dow Corning implants may contain Dow Corning gel.

Blue Cross/Blue Shield Health Plans

     Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Alabama, Blue Shield of California, and Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Minnesota said they agree with the Tort Claimants
Committee that setting a bar date for breast implant claims is
premature.

     The health plans also contend that Dow Corning has made no
provision for their filing proofs of claim.  They say they have a
right to be reimbursed for payments made to each of their members
who has received breast implant-related services, regardless of
whether the member files a proof of claim against Dow Corning.

     The Tort Claimants Committee is represented by Alfred S.
Lurey and Dennis S. Meir of Kilpatrick & Cody in Atlanta; Marvin
E. Frankel, Kenneth H. Eckstein and Philip Bentley of Kramer,
Levin, Naftalis, Nessen, Kamin & Frankel in New York City; and

NY PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO
LIFT AUTOMATIC STAY
TO LIQUIDATE CLAIMS

     New York breast implant plaintiffs on Dec. 26 filed a motion
with the bankruptcy court in Bay City, MI, asking that the
automatic stay be lifted so that they can proceed with, or in
some cases initiate, lawsuits against Dow Corning Corp.  In re
Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.).

     The plaintiffs argue that they are only seeking to liquidate
their claims, not execute on them.  Once the claims are
liquidated, they say, the claims will become subject to
bankruptcy court jurisdiction as core proceedings.

     The plaintiffs are those whose cases were originally filed
in the New York Supreme Court or the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York and consolidated before the Hon.
Joan B. Lobis for pretrial coordination and discovery.

     The plaintiffs' suits are currently unliquidated claims over
which the bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction, the plaintiffs
state.  After the claims are reduced to judgment, they will be
considered liquidated claims and will fall under bankruptcy
jurisdiction as core proceedings, they say.

     The plaintiffs argue that they are now "burdened with a
continuing 'stay' of all litigation unless plaintiffs agree to
dismiss Dow Corning with prejudice from all their actions.  Since
Judge [Sam C.] Pointer [overseeing the multidistrict litigation
proceedings] will not allow plaintiffs to proceed with any
litigation unless they agree to forfeit their rights against the
Dow Corning bankruptcy estate, plaintiffs have no recourse but to
seek relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay so their lawsuits
can move forward."

     The motion was filed by Dawn S. DeWeil of Schneider,
Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek & Shoot in New York City.

DCC OBJECTS TO FEE
APPLICATIONS, HEARING
SET FOR JAN. 18

     Dow Corning Corp. on Dec. 21 objected to the first interim
fee applications filed by several professional firms for services
to the estate.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI
Bankr.).

     A hearing on the matter is set for Thursday, Jan. 18.

     Dow Corning said it objects to the following requests for
fees and expenses:

     " $50,008 requested by Ernst & Young, which Dow Corning
claims was for services performed prior to the effective date of
retention.  Ernst & Young is seeking a total of $790,188 in fees
and $43,791 in expenses.

     " $102,000 requested by the law firm of Kilpatrick & Cody,
which Dow Corning also claims is for pre-retention services.  Dow
Corning objects to another $15,000 requested for expenses
associated with attendance at an American Trial Lawyers
Association conference on breast implant litigation.  Kilpatrick
& Cody is asking for a total of $774,133 in fees and $91,059.26
in expenses.

     " $25,544 in fees, out of a total of $151,661.50 in fees and
$19,748.69 in expenses, requested by Bricker & Eckler.  The
disputed amount was for pre-retention services, Dow Corning
states.

     " $41,560.97 in allegedly unsupported and unreimbursable
expenses for various members of the Tort Claimants Committee.

     " $25,562 requested by Kramer, Levin, Naftalis, Nessen,
Kamin & Frankel for 80.2 hours in responding to Dow Corning's
motion for sanctions against the law firm of O'Quinn, Kerensky,
McAninch & Laminack and Richard Laminack.  Dow Corning claims
that Kramer Levin's filings were duplicative and unnecessary, and
provided no benefit to the debtor's estate.  Kramer Levin is
seeking a total of $1,234,323.63 in fees and $157,982.99 in
expenses.

     Dow Corning said it saved $103,324 resolving other
objections through an informal process of negotiation.

     The objections were filed by Barbara J. Houser, Craig J.
Litherland and Millie A. Sall of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay in
Dallas.

DCC SEEKS PERMISSION TO
GIVE IMPLANT SAMPLES TO
UNIVERSITY FOR STUDY

     Dow Corning Corp. on Dec. 19 asked the bankruptcy court in
Bay City, MI, for permission to give 160 pairs of breast implants
to a university that is conducting a study that Dow Corning
believes will assist the court in estimating rupture claims.  In
re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.)

     Dow Corning states that, in 1992, a "leading American
university" began a study of the structural integrity and rupture
rate of breast implants.  The study's methodology includes
comparing Dow Corning implants that have been explanted from
their recipients with new, unused samples of DCC implants that
were manufactured in the same lots as the explants.

     Dow Corning had no role in initiating or establishing the
study's protocol and has no rights with respect to the results,
Dow Corning states.  The company also says that donating the
implants to the study would be consistent with pre-bankruptcy
discovery orders issued by various courts relating to
preservation/non-destruction of evidence.

     The motion was filed by Barbara J. Houser, Craig J.
Litherland and David Ellerbe of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay in Dallas;
and by Rozanne M. Giunta and Susan M. Cook of Lambert, Leser,
Cook, Schmidt & Giunta in Bay City, MI.

JUDGE ALLOWS DCC TO
EXTEND CANADIAN
LIMITATIONS PERIOD

     U.S  Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Spector on Dec. 7 granted
Dow Corning Corp.'s motion to enter into a stipulation extending
the statute of limitations in a Canadian breast implant class
action.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.);
see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.

               On Nov. 21, Dow Corning filed a motion relating to a class
action pending in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
Harrington v. Dow Corning Corp. et al., No. C954330.  All of the
approximately 15 other defendants have agreed to extend the
limitations period from Dec. 31, 1995, the date provided for in
the British Columbia Class Proceedings Act, until April 30, 1996.
However, Dow Corning said, its bankruptcy filing and the
associated automatic stay raised a question as to whether the
company could unilaterally enter into such a stipulation.

     The Canadian court had planned to hold a hearing Dec. 13 on
certifying the class with respect to Dow Corning; that hearing
was continued until next year.  All of the other defendants,
citing the need for more time to prepare for the certification
hearing, stipulated to the extension.  Dow Corning argued that
it, too, needed additional time to prepare for arguments.

     Judge Spector found the relief requested was appropriate.

CANADIAN SUPREME COURT
UPHOLDS DCC'S LIABILITY
IN BREAST IMPLANT SUIT

     Dow Corning is liable for failing to warn a patient of the
possibility that her breast implant could rupture as a result of
normal, everyday activities, a 5-2 majority of the Canadian
Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21.  Dow Corning Corp. v. Hollis,
No. 23776 (Canadian Sup. Ct.).

     The majority said Dow Corning could have met that duty by
warning the surgeon who performed the implantation, but failed to
warn the doctor.  The dissenting opinion said the patient should
be required to prove that the doctor, had he been properly warned
by Dow Corning, would have passed the information on to her.

     In 1983, Susan Hollis had two gel-filled, low profile, round
Silastic implants, manufactured by Dow Corning, implanted by Dr.
John R. Birch to correct breast abnormalities.  At a later date,
another surgeon removed the implants and found that one of them
had ruptured but there was no evidence of the silicone envelope
that had surrounded the ruptured implant.  Subsequently, Hollis
underwent bilateral subcutaneous mastectomies and immediate
replacement with saline implants.

     Hollis filed suit, claiming that Dow Corning was negligent
in the manufacture or design of the implant that ruptured and
negligent in failing to give adequate warnings to the medical
profession or the public of the possibility that the implants
could rupture.  She claimed that Birch had been negligent in
failing to warn her of the risks of implant rupture and that the
second doctor had been negligent in failing to exercise adequate
care to prevent implant rupture during explantation.

               Following an 18-day trial, the trial judge found that Dow
Corning was negligent in the manufacture of the implant; that it
was unnecessary to decide whether Dow Corning was negligent in
failing to warn adequately; that neither doctor had been
negligent; that Birch was under no duty to warn Hollis of the
possibility of implant rupture; and that there was no contract of
sale and purchase between Birch and Hollis with respect to the
implants.

     Hollis was awarded C$95,000 for non-pecuniary damages, past
loss of income and for future loss of income.

     On appeal, the Court of Appeal found lack of evidence for
the conclusion that the implant rupture was caused by Dow
Corning's negligence.  However, it found that Dow Corning
possessed relevant information with respect to the risk of
rupture that it did not make available to the medical community.
The court reversed the dismissal of the negligence action against
Birch, ordered a new trial and dismissed Hollis' cross-appeal
that the damages award was inordinately low.

     On appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, the sole issue was
whether Dow Corning is liable to Hollis because it failed to warn
Birch.

     The majority first found that Dow Corning was under a duty
to warn of the risks of unexplained ruptures at the time Hollis
received her implants.  It noted that Dow Corning had at that
point received between 48 and 61 reports of unexplained ruptures,
but that it did not begin warning doctors of this phenomenon for
another two years.

     Next, the majority said Dow Corning could have escaped
liability, if it had adequately warned Birch, under the learned
intermediary doctrine.  Dow Corning contended that it should not
be liable unless Hollis could prove that Birch, had he been
properly informed of the rupture risk, would have passed the
information on to Hollis.  However, the majority rejected this
contention, finding that it would require the plaintiff to prove
a hypothetical situation.

     "It is clear from the record that Ms. Hollis' right to
informed consent was not respected in this case," the majority
said.  "We know that Dow's failure to warn was a cause of her
injury; whether Dr. Birch's actions in the hypothetical situation
posited by Dow might also have been a cause is not a matter for
Ms. Hollis to prove."

     The appropriate test, the majority said, is a subjective
test: would Hollis have gone ahead with the implant surgery if
she had been adequately warned, not the objective test of what a
"reasonable woman" would have done.  The majority found that
Hollis proved she would not have had the surgery if she had been
warned.

HOLLIS, PART II

     "Simply put," the majority stated, "I do not think a
manufacturer should be able to escape liability for failing to
give a warning it was under a duty to give, by simply presenting
evidence tending to establish that even if the doctor had been
given the warning, he or she would not have passed it on to the
patient, let alone putting an onus on the plaintiff to do so.
Adopting such a rule would, in some cases, run the risk of
leaving the plaintiff with no compensation for her injuries.  She
would not be able to recover against a doctor who had not been
negligent with respect to the information he or she did have; yet
she also would not be able to recover against a manufacturer who,
despite having failed in its duty to warn, could escape liability
on the basis that, had the doctor been appropriately warned, he
or she would not have passed the information on to the plaintiff.
Our tort law should not be held to contemplate such an anomalous
result."

     The dissent first said that use of the subjective test is
improper because it fails to account for the "inherent
unreliability of the plaintiff's self-serving assertion."

     "It is not simply a question as to whether the plaintiff is
believed," the dissent said.  "The plaintiff may be perfectly
sincere in stating that in hindsight she believed that she would
not have consented to the operation.  This is not a statement of
fact that, if accepted, concludes the matter.  It is an opinion
about what the plaintiff would have done in respect of a
situation that did not occur....  In evaluating the opinion, the
trier of fact must discount its probity not only by reason of its
self-serving nature, but also by reason of the fact that it is
likely to be colored by the trauma occasioned by the failed
procedure.  For this reason, the most reliable approach in
determining what would in fact have occurred is to test the
plaintiff's assertion by reference to objective evidence as to
what a reasonable person would have done."

     Next, the dissent said that "well established tort
principles" require Hollis to prove that her injuries would not
have occurred had Dow Corning properly warned Birch.

     "In other words," the dissent said, "Ms. Hollis must show
that her doctor would have warned her of any dangers that had
been brought to his attention and that if warned she would have
refused the operation.  Absent this form of proof, it cannot be
said with any degree of certainly that the failure of Dow to warn
physicians was the cause of the unfortunate injuries suffered by
Ms. Hollis."

     The dissent said a new trial should have been ordered
because the majority improperly resolved factual issues that are
the province of the trial court.
               Hollis was represented by Donald J. McKinlay of Lang
Michener Lawrence & Shaw in Vancouver, BC.  Dow Corning was
represented by Derek J. Mullan and David W. Donohoe of Clark,
Wilson in Vancouver.

OR JUDGE PARTIALLY
DISMISSES SUIT OVER
CONFIDENTIAL AGREEMENT

     A suit brought by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
against a breast implant recipient and her attorneys for
allegedly revealing the amount of a confidential settlement
agreement was dismissed in part by a federal judge in Oregon on
Nov. 30.  Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. v. Thies et al.,
No. 95-1075-JE (D OR).

     Magistrate Judge John Jelderks of the U.S. District Court
for the District of Oregon granted a motion by defendant attorney
Michael L. Williams and his firm, Williams & Troutwine, P.C., to
dismiss 3M's claims for declaratory relief, negligence and
intentional interference with the company's economic advantage
and business relations.

     Judge Jelderks, however, denied the defendants' motion to
dismiss 3M's claim alleging that the defendants breached their
contractual agreement not to disclose the amount of a proposed
settlement.

     The present litigation involves a settlement reached between
3M and defendant Marjorie A. Thies over injuries Thies allegedly
suffered from her 3M breast implants.  Williams served as her
attorney in that action, which was settled in June 1995.  Under
the terms of the agreement, Thies was to receive a certain sum of
money by July 11, 1995.  Thies and her attorneys allegedly agreed
not to disclose the amount of the settlement.

     3M filed the present action on July 25, 1995, alleging that
Thies and her attorneys breached the confidentiality provision of
the settlement by disclosing the amount of the agreement.  The
company also claimed that Williams & Troutwine intentionally
interfered with 3M's prospective economic advantage and business
relations in connection with the silicone gel implant products
liability litigation by disclosing the amount of the settlement.

     Williams & Troutwine moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that
dismissal was appropriate pursuant to the abstention doctrine in
Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  The firm also said the
suit should be stayed under the abstention doctrine in Colorado
River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800
(1976).  3M's claims for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted should also be dismissed, the firm argued.

     In his opinion, Judge Jelderks concluded that the court
should abstain from considering 3M's claim for declaratory
judgment, but should not abstain from considering the remainder
of the company's claims.

     "The most important element of this claim " the assertion
that 3M is not obligated to pay the Thieses in accordance with
the settlement agreement " was necessarily considered, and
rejected, in state court proceedings," the judge said.  "Review
of that conclusion is now pending in the Oregon appellate
system."

     Under these circumstances, Judge Jelderks said, the
principles of comity and federalism underlying in the Younger
decision favor abstention from consideration of 3M's first claim.

     "Oregon has an important interest in providing a forum for
the final resolution of issues raised, and decided, in the first
instance in its judicial system," the judge said.  "The state has
an important interest in providing that forum without concern
that duplicative litigation in a federal court might yield a
different result or otherwise put in question the finality of
state court judgments."

January 9, 1996

THIES, PART II

     In concluding that abstention from consideration of 3M's
first claim is appropriate, Judge Jelderks said the state has an
important interest in determining whether parties have
conclusively resolved the issues giving rise to litigation in its
courts, and in providing the appellate forum in which the
conclusions of its trial courts are tested.

     However, the judge said that Younger abstention is not
appropriate as to the balance of 3M's claims because these claims
raise issues that the state court was not required to reach in
deciding whether to grant the Thieses' motion for summary
judgment on the supplemental complaint.

     "There is neither an action pending in state court involving
all of the parties involved in this federal action, nor a pending
state proceeding in which 3M can pursue those claims not
inevitably addressed by the state court's conclusion that 3M was
not excused from performing its obligations under the settlement
agreement," Judge Jelderks said.

     The judge also held that Colorado River abstention is
inapplicable to the present litigation because no concurrent
state court action joins all the parties in the present
litigation.  In Colorado River, the court concluded that federal
courts should sometimes abstain from exercising jurisdiction when
concurrent state proceedings are pending.

     Judge Jelderks accepted the defendants' contention that 3M's
negligence claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim
upon which relief may be granted.  Citing Hale v. Groce, 304 Or.
281, 284, 744 P.2d 1289 (1987), the judge said a party is not
ordinarily liable for negligently causing strictly economic harm
to another.

     "Oregon cases simply cannot be read as imposing upon counsel
or their clients some special duty to further the economic
interests of the adverse party," Judge Jelderks said.  "Hale does
not support 3M's position."

     The judge accepted the defendants' argument that 3M failed
to state an actionable intentional interference claim because it
cannot plead the requisite business relationship, and because it
cannot plead or prove that any alleged interference stemmed from
an improper motive.

     "Having reviewed Oregon cases discussing this tort, as well
as the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977) and relevant
treatises, I am convinced that 3M does not have the kind of
business or professional relationship with those allegedly
injured by its products that is protected by an intentional
interference cause of action," Judge Jelderks said.

     Representing 3M was William B. Crow and Jeffrey D. Austin of
Miller, Nash, Wiener, Hager & Carlsen of Portland, OR.
Representing Thies was William A. Gaylord of Gaylord & Eyerman,
P.C. in Portland.  Counsel for Williams and Troutwine, P.C. was
Donald W. McEwen and Jonathan M. Radmacher of McEwen, Gisvold,
Rankin, Carter & Streinz in Portland.
