<b>ADDISON BAIN</b>
<P>
In 1959, Addison Bain started his career at the Marshall Space Flight 
Center in 
Alaska, designing equipment and systems for missile fuels such as liquid 
and gaseous 
hydrogen. Then he moved on to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, 
where he 
operated and maintained hydrogen systems and eventually became Hydrogen 
Program 
Manager. Bain organized the first comprehensive hydrogen-leak-detection 
conference 
at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and he was instrumental in 
developing the 
NASA Hydrogen Safety Handbook, the International Standards Organization's 
(ISO) 
Hydrogen Fuel Specifications, and federal policies and procedures for 
liquid-hydrogen 
acquisition. 
<P>Bain is a founding member of the International Association for 
Hydrogen Energy, 
the National Hydrogen Association, and the ISO's Hydrogen Energy 
Technologies 
Technical Committee 197.  He has also managed numerous studies involving 
hydrogen 
production, storage, and distribution and has supported DOE hydrogen 
program 
reviews. 
<P>
In addition to serving on the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel, Mr. Bain 
is on 
the advisory panels of the American Hydrogen Association and the Florida 
Energy 
Center.
