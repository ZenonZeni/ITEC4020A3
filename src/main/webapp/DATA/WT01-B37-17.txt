<p><font size="4">Cops on the Dole</font><font size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph D. McNamara</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Wall Street Journal - January 15, 1996</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">During my 35 years in law enforcement, I found
that police officers were unabashed conservatives, vigorously
denouncing welfare and other government handouts. Yet too often
cops display a liberal, big government mentality when it comes to
their own funding.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A small example of this mindset can be found in
the latest newsletter from an association of retired New York
City police brass. The retired police supervisors were unhappy
that under the Republican plan the &quot;annual premium for
Medicare would nearly double from the present $46 to $90 by the
year 2002.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Keep in mind that patrol officers now make
approximately $65,000 a year in New York City and that top
executives receive at least twice that. After 20 years of
service, cops retire at half pay and with generous medical
benefits. Many (like me) then go on to second careers. It's
revealing that even an affluent bunch of retired cops is ready to
sell out their conservative ideology for $44 over six years.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">So it should hardly be surprising that when the
stakes are higher, the cops are willing to support a law
enforcement policy run out of Washington. Recall how many times
last year you saw President Clinton denouncing crime while
standing in front of ranks of uniformed cops gathered from around
the country. These cops were lending their support to President
Clinton's plan to spend billions in federal money to hire 100,000
more police officers around the country. Now, we don't hear many
of these officers speaking up for the House passed Republican
crime bill, which would offer &quot;block grants&quot;. instead
of money earmarked for a specific number of officers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fact these high-ranking police officers
appear to be backing a program destined to do little, if
anything, for their stated mission-reducing crime. When even
champions of the status quo like the police are turning to the
welfare state, it is a dire warning to the Republicans to stay
with &quot;block grants&quot; and not yield to the Clinton
administration's quest for to pay for 100,000 more police with
federal funds.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Empirical evidence suggests that anticrime
legislation emanating from Washington has done little more than
create a fiscal crisis for state and local governments forced to
build more prisons and hire more judges, prosecutors, public
defenders and prison guards.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">From 1982 to 1992 total government expenditures
for the justice system increased by 162%. However, federal
justice expenditures increased by 291% while municipalities
increased justice spending by only 115%. These enormous increases
occurred even before President Clinton's $33 billion dollar crime
bill passed last year. Crime has declined during recent years but
most of that decline is due to changing demographics, not to
higher spending.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The biggest increases occurred for i prison
expenditures. Long mandatory sentences passed by Congress caused
a 549% increase in the amount of tax dollars spent to lock people
away in federal prisons. As a former policeman, I applaud seeing
murderers, rapists, robbers and other violent criminals locked
up. Alas, more than 60% of the inmates in federal prisons are
incarcerated for non-violent crimes. Many are there for drug
crimes, even though putting them behind bars has not led to any
diminution in drug trafficking or drug use. Instead, clogging the
justice system with drug offenders allows a number of violent
criminals to fall through the cracks and go on hurting people.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Policing has always been a local business.
Despite the publicity given to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, there are only 11,000 FBI agents compared with
600,000 local police. Some police departments need additional
officers. Others are poorly managed and wasteful. It is still
common in many cities to see police stations full of cops who
should be on the streets. New York City Police Commissioner
William Bratton has shown that simply redeploying existing
officers, and instituting new management techniques, can help
reduce crime.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But when money comes from Washington, there is
little or no incentive for local governments to engage in the
kind of priority-setting needed to effectively combat crime.
During the 18 years that I spent as a police chief, I found that
a locally elected city council would balance my requests for more
officers with other needs. The police and other city departments
were judged on how personnel were used and whether citizens had
gotten the kind of service they deserved. At times it was
painful, but this kind of local competition serves taxpayers a
lot better than getting funny money from Washington.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">That message doesn't seem to have gotten
through to a lot of my former colleagues in law enforcement. Thus
we see cops traipsing off to Washington to serve as props for
President Clinton's photo ops. (How can they afford this, anyway,
if they claim they don't have enough money to combat crime?) We
also see retired cops bellyaching about the Medicare cutbacks
mentioned earlier. Instead of crying for more help from Uncle
Sam, police executives should ask Washington to take less in
taxes from localities to allow cities to hire and use police
according to local needs and not based on some grand plan from
federal bureaucrats. <br>
