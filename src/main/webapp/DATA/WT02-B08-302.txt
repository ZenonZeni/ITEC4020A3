<H1>Oceanic Kelvin & Rossby Waves</H1>
<p>
<p>
<h3>
When sea level changes by 1 centimeter (.4 inches) it results in an ocean current carrying several millions of cubic meters of water per second.  This is several times the discharge rate of the all the rivers in the world!  Thus, even small changes in sea level cause massive adjustments of ocean circulation, which occur as slowly moving waves.  Two important examples are Kelvin and Rossby waves.  
<p>
Kelvin waves always move eastward and cross the Pacific Ocean along the equator in about two months.  The energy from Kelvin waves can trigger long-lived Rossby waves. 
<p>
Rossby waves always move westward and are caused by the Earth's rotation.  Observing them is extremely difficult because they change sea level only 10 - 20 centimeters (4 - 8 inches) and are spread over hundreds of kilometers.  Rossby waves can take more than 10 years to cross the Pacific at the latitude of Los Angeles, California and more than 30 years at the latitude of Portland, Oregon.                
<p>
Kelvin and Rossby waves can alter sea surface temperatures and affect weather patterns for long periods of time.  For example, in 1994 scientists mapped a Rossby wave that was a remnant of an El Nino that happened ten years earlier!  They concluded that the Kuroshio current, found off the east coast of Japan, was pushed northward by this Rossby wave.  This may have contributed to the flooding across the midwestern U.S. in 1993 by raising the temperature of the northwest Pacific Ocean.
