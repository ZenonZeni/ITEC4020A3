<STRONG>Thanks to Revaluation</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
Most foreign stock markets wound up with gains in 1971. Standouts
were United Kingdom, with rise of 46%; Japan up over 50%. But,
Italy suffers an 11% loss.

<H3>75 Years Ago Today (January 16, 1922)</H3><p>

<STRONG>Selling Dead Stocks</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
A lot of selling in Erie was done by a few big holders who had
carried the a stock for years and were convinced that it was among
the &#147;dead&#148; ones so far as the immediate future of the
market was concerned. This accounts for the sudden appearance
of selling in many such issues. People drag along for years with
a stock and then find that they are carrying a hopeless investment
and sell it to get into some other issue which gives more promise
for the future.
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Rockefeller &#147;Boys&#148; Bearing the Market?</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
That the Rockefeller &#147;boys&#148; - Percy and William G. -
are factors in the stock market on an important scale is a story
which has been going the rounds of Wall Street for the past week
or more. And their activity is believed to be on the bearside.
In fact, to them and following is credited much of the weakness
in shares of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway.
<BR><BR>
The sons of William Rockefeller are not novices in stock speculation;
nor are they always successful in their Wall Street ventures.
But in recent turns their winnings are believed to have been fairly
substantial.

<a name="B"><H3>The History of Barron's, The Dow Jones Business and Financial Weekly
</H3></a>



<P><STRONG>BARRON'S</STRONG> magazine first appeared on the nation's newsstands May 9, 1921, at a seemingly unlikely time -- the depth of a post-World War I recession.</P>




<P>But to Clarence W. Barron, the publication's founder and namesake, the time was right: &quot;A fresh financial publication based on sound sources of information and policy should be a helpful factor in assuring return of confidence to the world of business,&quot; he wrote in that first issue.</P>


 

<P>      Mr. Barron, president and owner of Dow Jones & Company, served as editor of the magazine to which he applied the motto &quot;the application of money to positive ends.&quot; Son-in-law Hugh Bancroft, who proposed the financial weekly -- with an eye toward making use of <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM>  presses that were idle on Sundays -- was the magazine's publisher. </P>




<P><strong>Barron's</strong>  initial cover price was 20 cents, and an annual subscription was $10. The introductory issue's cover story, &quot;European Unsettlements -- The Distress of France,&quot; carried Mr. Barron's byline. When<EM> Barron's</EM>  made its debut, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (then comprised of 20 stocks) was a lofty 79.48. The first issue was 16 pages and sold approximately 9,000 copies. Circulation in this 75th anniversary year is over 275,000. </P>




<P>As circulation has grown, so has <strong>Barron's</strong>  reputation for journalism that affects corporations and financial markets and that is consistently ahead of the curve. Some historical examples:</P>


<blockquote>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Exposed financial discrepancies in the New Haven Railroad's 1955 annual report. The discrepancies, covering up financial woes, subsequently led the railroad to file for bankruptcy.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Scored a 1970 coup on the imminent collapse of the Bernard Cornfield empire, Investors Overseas Services, LTD., which <strong>Barron's</strong>  began to suspect from the strange action of I.O.S. stock on the London market.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Correctly forecast the disaster that befell holders of $2.4 billion of Washington Power Supply System bonds; 1983.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Months before the October 1987 market crash, headlined an article &quot;Bears Take Over The World&quot; and warned that the Federal Reserve would likely tighten credit.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> An August 1988 cover story, &quot;The Coming Collapse in Home Prices,&quot; gave readers an early warning of the impending fall in residential real estate prices.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Broke the story on the perils ahead for investment portfolios of life insurers; 1990.<BR>
<BR>

<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> Warned of the pitfalls of exotic derivatives securities in 1993, well ahead of the derivatives trading woes that ultimately bankrupted California's Orange County.
</blockquote>


<P><strong>Barron's</strong>  initial focus on stocks and bonds has broadened through the years, tracking reader interest in a widening array of investment vehicles. During the '70s, the business and financial weekly added columns on commodities, options, international stock exchanges and the domestic real estate market. The '80s brought such <strong>Barron's</strong>  features as the Sotheby's Art Index and the weekly column Current Yield, an analysis of bond markets. The '90s, so far, have seen expanded mutual funds coverage, including the recent introduction of an annual assessment of mutual fund families; the launch of <strong>Barron's</strong>  quarterly Big Money Poll, a survey of major institutional money managers' views on financial markets; and stepped-up coverage of the technology industry with the opening of a bureau in Palo Alto, Calif.</P>


       <strong>Barron's</strong>  75th birthday is a milepost achieved by fewer than one in 150 magazines. With 75 years experience, <strong>Barron's</strong>  remains forward-looking, and what it sees transcends the printed page: &quot;<strong>Barron's</strong>  will join the rush to the Internet, launching a Web-based weekly edition,&quot; Editor Edwin A. Finn Jr. said. &quot;Readers of the on-line edition, for example, will be able to get historical financial data and stock market information about any company mentioned and do their own customized investment research using <strong>Barron's</strong>  data.&quot;
      

<P><STRONG>Barron's</STRONG>  is also enhancing its international presence with the addition of correspondents in Tokyo and London. Its first international forum was held recently in Tokyo. Another is scheduled later this year.</P>


       

<P>In the 75 years since Clarence Barron launched his weekly financial magazine, it has become more comprehensive, even global. What hasn't changed is the commitment to provide readers the best intelligence for making wise investment decisions.</P>

<a name="C"><h3>Who Was Clarence Walker Barron?</H3></a>




<P>CLARENCE W. BARRON (1855-1928), founder of <strong>Barron's</strong> magazine and generally considered the &quot;father of financial journalism,&quot; was born July 2, 1855, in Boston, to Henry, a struggling merchant, and Elana Barron. Clarence Barron began his journalism career at the <EM>Boston Daily News</EM>, writing on business and economics before he was 20 years old. He moved to the <EM>Boston Transcript</EM> as a reporter in 1875 and, convincing his editors of the value of reporting the news affecting the market tables, created the newspaper's first financial section and served as its editor.</P>




<P>In July 1887, when just 32 years old, Mr. Barron decided there was need of a service that would publish financial news during the day in bulletin form and established the Boston News Bureau, a newspaper regarded as the &quot;Financial Bible of New England.&quot; Subsequently, he arranged for the Boston News Bureau to exchange news with Dow Jones & Company, which also published financial bulletins, and The Wall Street Journal in New York. In 1896 he founded the Philadelphia News Bureau.</P>




<P>  In 1902 Mr. Barron acquired Dow Jones from ailing founder Charles H. Dow and partner Charles Bergstresser. Co-founder Edward D. Jones had left the company three years earlier.</P>




<P>Mr. Barron was initially a passive owner, preferring to spend time at his home and farm in Massachusetts. He met with the board of directors in 1902 and then not again for almost 10 years, infrequently visiting Dow Jones' offices. He was more actively involved with Doremus & Company, the financial advertising firm he established in 1904. His wife, Jessie, was his representative on the Dow Jones board, and she assumed an active role in the company.</P>




<P>But it was almost inevitable that Mr. Barron, a colorful individual with influential friends and a seemingly endless amount of energy, would become more involved in running Dow Jones. The turning point occurred in 1912 when, suspecting the company faced a financial slump, he became president and assumed day-to-day control. In addition to his management function, he became editor of <EM>The Wall Street Journal</EM> and its lead reporter, often filing dispatches on finance and politics, many during his frequent trips to Europe. Under his tutelage, Journal writing and headlines became crisper and profiles of business people were added.</P>




<P>It was Mr. Barron's reporting that exposed Charles Ponzi's investment scam in 1920. Mr. Ponzi, who Mr. Barron claimed was paying investors exorbitant yields in a pyramid scheme using money from subsequent investors, countered with a $5 million libel suit. The expos&eacute; ultimately led to Mr. Ponzi's conviction. The libel action against Mr. Barron was dismissed.</P>




<P>Convinced of the need for a national, weekly financial magazine, Mr. Barron, then 66 years old, introduced <strong>Barron's</strong> on May 9, 1921. He wrote the lead story in the first issue, <EM>European Unsettlements -- The Distress of France</EM>, while in Paris. At its launch, Barron's, The National Financial Weekly, had a cover price of 20 cents and an annual subscription price of $10.</P>




<P>Mr. Barron wrote several books, including &quot;Twenty-eight Essays on The Federal Reserve Act,&quot; &quot;The Audacious War,&quot; &quot;The Mexican Problem&quot; and &quot;A World Remaking, or Peace Finance.&quot; His edited notes and writings, including records of conversations with the likes of Calvin Coolidge and Henry Ford, were published as &quot;They Told Barron&quot; and &quot;More They Told Barron.&quot;</P>




<P>Despite frequent health problems compounded by his immense girth (upwards of 330 pounds on a 5-foot-5-inch frame), Mr. Barron remained active as president of Dow Jones and editor and writer for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's until shortly before his death on Oct. 2, 1928, at age 73. He was predeceased by Jessie, a widow with two daughters when she married Clarence, and stepdaughter Martha. He was survived by stepdaughter Jane Bancroft and her husband, Hugh, who was the first publisher of <strong>Barron's</strong> and an officer of Dow Jones. Their descendents continue to have a controlling interest in Dow Jones, and three members of the Bancroft family are directors of the company.</P><BR>
