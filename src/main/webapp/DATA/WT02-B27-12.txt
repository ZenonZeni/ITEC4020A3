<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>

The aroma of antiseptic and crisp sheets mingles with the 
sooty smell of a small coal-burning fireplace at the end of the infirmary room.
"Coxeter, how do you imagine time-travel would work?" says John Petrie.<P>

"You mean as in H.G. Wells?" says Coxeter. The two 14-year-old boys are in
side-by-side beds recovering from the flu in their private school's sick-room.
H.G. Wells's classic science fiction story
<A  HREF="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/158/1"><I>The Time Machine
</I></A> is a popular topic of conversation. Both boys are very bright and
believe time travel will eventually be possible. "I suppose one might find
it necessary to pass into the fourth dimension," says Coxeter. <P> 

That is the moment when Coxeter began forming ideas of hyperdimensional
geometries. The boys had some books and games by their beds. They started
playing around with ideas of higher dimensional space. Eventually these
early musings lead Coxeter to his discoveries and books about regular
polytopes--geometric shapes that extend into the fourth dimension and
beyond.
<P>

<B>History: </B> Discovered new regular polyhedron having six hexagonal faces
at each vertex, 1926; enumerated the n-dimensional kaleidoscopes, 1933; Coxeter
groups; inversive distance between two disjoint circles (or spheres).
Author of 6 books on geometry including "Introduction to Geometry" (1961),
"Projective Geometry" (1964), "Twelve Geometric Essays" (1968), "Regular
Complex Polytopes" 1974. Co-author and editor of numerous other books
including "M.C. Escher: Art and Science" (1986). "Kaleidoscopes" (1995) is
a collection of 26 of his papers on polytopes, etc.<P>


<B>The Young Scientist: </B> 
Because of a school essay Coxeter wrote at the age of about 14 on the 
idea of projecting geometric shapes into higher dimensions, Coxeter's
father, who was a pacifist and friend of <A HREF="http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~shalizi/Russell/">Bertrand Russell</A>, took him to see
the brilliant philosopher. Russell helped the Coxeters find an excellent 
math tutor and Coxeter was formally
trained and fast-tracked for Cambridge University.

Coxeter's major contribution was in the area of <I><B>Dimensional Analogy</B></I>. 
</CENTER>
<P>

<B>Regular Polytope:</B> Coxeter is famous for his work on Regular Polytopes. 
The process of stretching geometrical shapes into higher dimensions is 
called "Dimensional Analogy". These shapes are called "Polytopes". 
When they involve coordinates made of complex numbers they are called 
"Complex Polytopes".
<P>
<B>Hypercube: </B>If you pull a cube into the fourth dimension you get a
hypercube. Eight cubes make a hypercube.
<P>
<B>Cube: </B>A square is flat. If you pull it up into the third
dimension you have a cube. Six squares make a cube.
<P>
<B>Line: </B>A line is a one dimensional shape. If you pull it in the
second dimension you have a square. Four lines make a
square.

 <B>Experiment:
</B>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/coxeter_tiles.gif" hspace=10> 
Try making some rhombus tiles. A rhombus is a squashed square. Make
two diamond shaped rhombuses, each having four equal sides. One rhombus has
two angles of 36 degrees and two of 144 degrees. The other one has two
angles of 72 degrees and two angles of 108 degrees.

<BR>
<BR>
Measure, draw and cut several dozen of these out of heavy card stock and
move them around on a table to make patterns and shapes. Roger Penrose has 
shown that these shapes can be used to make an aperiodic tiling of the plane. 
Try it. Try to make 3d shapes from these 2d rhomboids. How many can you make?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Consider 36 x 2 = 72. 36 x 3 = 108. 36 x 4 = 144. 1, 2, 3, and 4 multiples
of the same angle make up all the angles in the two shapes!<BR CLEAR=ALL><P>

If you love this and it gets you thinking and dreaming, you may have a
future in geometry.

<B>Mystery For Future
Generation:
</B> 4-colour map problem. Although a controversial computer proof has
recently been shown, Coxeter believes that a more elegant proof may still
be possible.
