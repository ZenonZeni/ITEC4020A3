<b>Export Manager Program</b>
</FONT><br>
</center>
<p><br>
<p><br><p>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>
The Export Manager Program is designed to increase the international
competitiveness of Victorian enterprises, expand existing export
markets and access new export markets.
<P>
The program will also help enhance the international marketing
and export administration skill levels of small to medium-sized
enterprises.
<P>
<H2>Background  </H2>
<P>
The pilot Export Manager Program, announced in the 1993 Industry
Statement, was expanded in the 1994-95 financial year and subsequent years.
<P>
More than 100 Victorian companies have already participated in the Export Manager Program since its inception in 1993.
<P>
Exporting expertise in the Australian manufacturing and service
sectors is still relatively low, particularly within smaller companies.
This has been recognised in the McKinsey report into emerging
exporters and the more recent L | E | K Partnership report, &quot;Intelligent
Exports and the Silent Revolution in Services&quot; (funded in part by Business Victoria).

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
A further round of the Program was launched on 30 October 1996.  Up to 30 places will be funded in this round and applications will be accepted until 20 December 1996.
<P>
A salary subsidy of up to 50% in the first year and up to 20% in the second year is available to approved applicants that employ an Export Manager for the first time.  Although there is no limit on the salary package an enterprise may pay their export manager, the Government subsidy is based on a total remuneration package ceiling of $50,000 per annum.  The maximum salary subsidy available is $35,000 over two years.
<P>
Participants in the Export Manager Program are also eligible
for the Export Education Program which provides places in
courses run by the College of International Business (Vic) Ltd,
the training arm of the Australian Institute of Export (Vic) Ltd.
<P>
The courses will provide understanding of the operational and
administrative aspects of the marketing needed to succeed in international
markets. Participants will be required to complete the course
within twelve months of the offer.

<H2>Funding</H2>
<P>
1995-96 funding for the Export Manager Program and the Export Education Program was $1.1 million.
