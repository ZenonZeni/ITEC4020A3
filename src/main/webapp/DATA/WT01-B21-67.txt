Cannabis Safely </p>

<p> <center><b>Oral vs Inhalation</b></center> </p>

<p> <center><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </center>
</p>

<p> Cannabis may be ingested orally or inhaled. Users of cannabis
usually inhale. Inhalation may be smoked or vaporized.Marinol's
fixed dose increment form is, for some patients, suboptimal for
induction </p>

<p> Gradual upward adjustment from a minimal initial dose over a
period of days was the standard of practice with cannabis extract
prior to removal in 1940 from prescriptive availability. </p>

<p> Anecdotal reports of users of both Marinol and cannabis
describe enhancement or constructive supplementation. Others who
have tried both have described cannabis as superior to Marinol.
The inhalation route is significantly more consistently
effective. </p>

<p> <b>Marinol </b>(dronabinol) synthetic delta -9
tetrahydrocannabinol dissolved in sesame oil. Supplied in fixed
doses of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 milligram soft gelatin capsules. Taken
orally. </p>

<p> <b>Cannabis</b> extract: </p>

<p> 9 known delta -9 Tetrahydrocannabinols </p>

<p> 2 known delta -8 Tetrahydrocannabinols </p>

<p> 50 other cannabinoids that may interact with or modify
reactions with the Tetrahydrocannabinols, the primary active
principles. </p>

<p> ( <i>Source: Marijuana and Health Institute of Medicine,
National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1982, P13-15)</i> </p>

<p> Oral ingestion of either cannabis or Marinol is characterized
by: </p>

<p> delayed onset of effects </p>

<p> variable level of effects </p>

<p> prolonged effects </p>

<p> Inhalation is characterized by: </p>

<p> quick onset of effects </p>

<p> consistent level of effects </p>

<p> shorter lasting effects. </p>

<p> <center><b>Inhalation: Vaporization vs Smoke</b> </center> </p>

<p> Significant irritants and toxic products of combustion
accompany smoking and can be minimized by vaporizing the
cannabinoids contained within the plant materials.
Tetrahydrocannabinols vaporize at 400 Fahrenheit while cellulose
combusts at 451 F. Two crude vaporizer prototypes have been
successfully demonstrated: a modified manually operated auto
cigarette lighter element, and a heat gun for electronic shrink
tubing set at 400 F. Unfortunately, vaporizers are currently
defined by law as illegal paraphernalia, a citable offense. </p>

<p> <b>Inhalation: Smoking: Harm Reduction Considerations</b> </p>

<p> Contrary to anti-marijuana statements that more potent or
stronger material is more dangerous, the opposite is true.
Admittedly cannabis smoke is irritating to the throat and lungs.
The less exposure the better. The more potent, the less exposure
is needed for effect. The potency before prohibition of medicinal
cannabis was greater than any illicit cannabis available- so far.
</p>

<p> For those using the drug infrequently or are sensitive to
cannabis, the lower potency of inexpensive illicit canabis may be
suitable. </p>

<p> The cooler, cleaner, and further the better. </p>

<p> A bong or water pipe is the best, a long pipe better than a
short pipe, a long joint better than a roach. </p>

<p> Not sharing a smoke is safer than passing it around and
possibly contracting infections diseases. </p>

<p> Never had it before? Use it with a friend who has. Find a
safe, quiet, and private place. Relax, and let the drug take its
effect. </p>

<p> Never use cannabis before or during driving or other
activities that need your full attention. </p>

<p> <center><b>Clinical Research Needed</b> </center> </p>

<p> Only <i>clinical</i> research comparing Marinol to other
Tetrahydrocannabinols and cannabinoids for therapeutic efficacy
can clarify this controversy. </p>

<p> Tentative and preliminary clinical findings indicate a
significant difference between Marinol and natural crude cannabis
preparations in favor of the crude product. Route of
administration and fixed incremental dosage may be factors in
comparative efficacy and unwanted effects. </p>
