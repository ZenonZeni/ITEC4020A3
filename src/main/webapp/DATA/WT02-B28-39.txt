	The 1957-79 period encompasses a considerable amount of the company's history.  Yet the
point is
worth making that the series of episodes recounted here, the people, the product development
and the
evolution of sales, management and electronic systems, took place in an environment of
unalloyed
American optimism.  While the United States had diverse view points on almost everything from
education to entertainment, practically everyone felt that the unique American democratic
system would
provide a better and better standard of living for all.  The great American boom became a
standard part
of life, no more surprising than Detroit's ads plugging the two-car family, or each family's
dream of the
three-bedroom suburban home.<P>
	The Keogh plan, named after a U.S. congressman from Brooklyn, was enacted in 1962,
making
tax-free private pension funding almost universal in the United States.  In the expanding
world of
savings, "investing for growth" had become as legitimate and desirable as "investing for
income."  The
new mindset created increased competition between different sectors of the financial services
industry.<P>
	In the midst of an increasingly competitive climate, the life insurance industry seemed
to be thriving. 
The number of life insurance companies grew by the hundreds in the 1960s and 1970s.  The
Institute
of Life Insurance's surveys showed that 85 percent of American families had some sort of life
insurance coverage; in more than half the families, all members of the household were
insured.  But
the percentage of disposable income spent on life insurance was declining every year, and
there
seemed to no way to stop it.  A strategic move into an expanding market like equities seemed
inevitable.<P>
	The exciting actuarial breakthrough made by Charles Sternhell, John Fraser, and Walter
Miller in 1969
opened the door to the move into equities.  Their discovery that the premium basis for a
variable policy
could be the same as for a fixed-dollar policy brought them industry-wide acclaim.<P>
	The rest of the industry created products from the New York Life formula, but the
company did not
enter the business until 1983, when it became possible to pay regular commissions on variable
life.  In
retrospect, it was the best possible decision, and not just for the protection of the agency
force.  Equities
- and the new variable life policies - did not perform well in the seventies.
