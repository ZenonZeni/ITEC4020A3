MID OCEAN IN NEW WAVE

THE INEXORABLE TRANSITION of Lloyd's from a market to something more
resembling the food court of a shopping mall, sheltering under its
franchising umbrella insurance companies rather than syndicates of
merchant venturers, took a major step forward at the end of 1995.  The
commercial future of the managing agencies involved now appears to be
assured, whether the Lloyd's rescue plan works or not, and so do
comfortable futures for the agency principals who will no doubt have
benefitted from the purchase of substantial goodwill.

On 13 December, Mid Ocean Ltd, Hamilton, announced the effective
acquisition of Brockbank Group plc, London (WICR180/18), Terra Nova
(Bermuda) Holdings Ltd, Hamilton, that of Octavian Syndicate Management
Ltd, London, and CNA Reinsurance Group, London, the creation of CNA
Corporate Capital Ltd, a subsidiary of CNA Management Ltd, which will
provide #25m (US$38.75m) in underwriting capacity to three managing
agencies through the creation of four parallel syndicates.  The total
commitment of capacity is #225m, added to which is a further #18m from
single corporate member syndicate 1211 backed by USF&G Corp, Baltimore
MD.

Mid Ocean and Brockbank will create a group which brings together the
existing Brockbank managing agency businesses with Baltusrol, a US$78m
Mid Ocean subsidiary created as the holding company for two new Lloyd's
dedicated corporate syndicates underwriting in parallel with
Brockbank's existing syndicates.  Mid Ocean will have a 51% share of
the enlarged Brockbank Group, and $50m of Baltusrol's capital will
provide capacity for the two corporate syndicates.  Brockbank's
business will substantially be transferred into a new unit, Brockbank
Holdings, which will exchange shares with Baltusrol, the latter taking
51% in Brockbank Holdings and Brockbank Holdings 49% in Baltusrol.  A
shareholders' agreement between the two groups includes undisclosed
undertakings providing Brockbank with equally undisclosed "additional
rights" for a limited period, while Mid Ocean received a commitment
that the transaction may be unwound if certain "trigger events", mainly
related to the acceptance of the Lloyd's rescue plan and the future
stability of the market, occur or do not occur before 1 September.
Otherwise, Mid Ocean will acquire all but one share of Brockbank by 1
September 1997 at a price independently determined, in cash or Mid
Ocean shares, or loan notes.  Brockbank executives representing 28.6%
of issued shares have already committed themselves to accept the offer.
 The merger was approved by Brockbank shareholders at an EGM on 29
December, irrevocable commitments from 56.7% of its shareholders having
previously been made.

Mid Ocean reported a net profit of US$182.9m for the year to 31
October, up from $91m in 1994.  Gross written premiums were $445.8m, up
from $358.6m.  Net income for Q4 included a provision of $21.5m for
losses arising from Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn, partly by a reduction
in Mid Ocean's provisions for the Kobe earthquake from $10m to $5m.
Net investment income totalled $73.8m for the year, up from $51.5m,
with net losses on investments down from $18.2m to $1.5m.

Terra Nova acquired the ongoing business of Octavian for an undisclosed
price.  A new managing agency, Octavian Syndicate Management Ltd, will
be created for 1996 and beyond, operating as an independent business
unit within the Terra Nova group.  The existing Octavian agency will
continue to be responsible for its syndicates until 1995 and prior
years are closed.  Nigel Rogers will continue as Octavian m/d, and join
the Terra Nova Bermuda board.  Terra Nova Capital Ltd, a newly created
corporate capital vehicle, will provide capacity to each of the five
Octavian syndicates (non-marine 702, aviation 959, marine 1009, marine
329, Abbey Motor 554).

CNA Re's new subsidiary CNA Corporate Capital Ltd, a subsidiary of CNA
Management Ltd, will provide #25m in capacity to Claremount
Underwriting Agency Ltd, London, syndicate 2506, Tower U/W Agents Ltd
(Archer Group plc, London) syndicates 923 and 947, and Cox Insurance
Holdings plc (Energy & Marine) syndicate 658 (#5m).

USF&G is the sole corporate member of syndicate 1211 through new
subsidiary F&G UK Underwriters Ltd, London, which has initial capacity
of #18m.  The syndicate will be underwritten by John Dendy, formerly
underwriter of syndicate 546 (Sturge Non-Marine Syndicate Management
Ltd).  At the same time, USF&G has formed and funded a new managing
agency for the syndicate, F&G UK Agency Ltd, London, as a joint venture
between F&G Holdings Ltd and managing agents Ashley Palmer Holdings
Ltd, London, which will provide support staff in accounts and
reporting, claims and credit control and reinsurance security
monitoring.

CER

Cie Europeenne de Reassurances, Paris, has announced an increase in
capital to SF106.673m (US$91.m) as part of a reorganisation plan which
will result in the unit trading under the new name of CER Paris.  As
part of that plan, Geneva-based financial holding Intercasings SA and
Penmore SA, Geneva, formerly the captive of the HEP power provider
Penhold Group of Canada, have acquired 100% of CER Paris.  Penmore was
sold, free of any liability, to Intercasings, and assumed the name of
Cie Europeenne de Reassurances (CER) at the beginning of December.

A capital increase of SF42m for CER in the form of convertible bonds
will be underwritten by Caisse Inter Professionnelle d'Assurance
(CIPAV), Paris, a non-profit organisation, effectively the holding and
operating company of 12 pension funds for French professions.  CIPAV is
putting up CF28m towards the capital increase and will take a 23.14%
stake in CER.  Ultimately Intercasings will only hold around 12.5% of
the equity of CER and about 10% of CER Paris when the bonds are
converted into CER shares.  Intercasings will retain the voting
majority in CER which has been delegated to the management of CER
Paris, with an agreement not to intervene in underwriting or investment
strategy.  All new and renewal risks will be underwritten in the name
of Cie Europeenne de Reassurances, with the exception of risks from
French ceding companies where CER Paris will remain the issuing
company.

CER Paris said in a statement that a further capital increase at CER
was currently being finalised, which will ultimately bring the total
equity of the group to SF125.2m.

DAI ICHI KYOTO RE

Philip Singer of Coopers & Lybrand and Mark Riley of Clark Whitehill
have been appointed joint provisional liquidators to Dai Ichi Kyoto
Reinsurance Co SA and Kobe Reinsurance SA, both Brussels.  They were
appointed by the High Court on the petition of the Belgian curator,
Jean-Michel Derick, in order to protect assets in the UK jurisdiction.
Mr Derick was appointed curator of the companies by the Belgian courts
in November.  The appointment of the provisional liquidators
effectively halts all legal actions involving these two companies
including the suit launched by CRM Insurance Services Ltd, London,
which managed a contact office for the two reinsurers (WICR161/16).

SCOR

Shareholders in SCOR SA, Paris, have approved plans for the absorption
of its largest shareholder HCS, the holding company which controls 48%
of the group's shares held by the major French insurance groups
(WICR178/17).  Following the merger Cie UAP SA, Paris, will have a 39%
direct stake in SCOR, Assurances Generales de France (AGF), Paris, 11%
and AXA SA, Paris, 10%.  SCOR said in a statement that the move
streamlines the legal and financial structure of the SCOR Group without
any dilution effects and will improve the liquidity of its shares.
SCOR also confirmed that its results for 1995 would be up strongly on
the net profit of about Fr280m (US$56.9m) earned in 1994.

SWISS RE

In keeping with its strategy of making Asia its third main operational
area, Schweizerische Ruckversicherung Ges (Swiss Re), Zurich, together
with ten Thai insurers, has formed a joint venture under the name SR
Risk Management Services Ltd, Bangkok.  The ten Thai companies in the
joint venture are Bangkok Insurance Public Co Ltd, The Dhipaya
Insurance Co Ltd, Insurance One Ltd, Muang Thai Life Assurance Co Ltd,
Phatra Insurance Public Co Ltd, Safety Insurance Public Co Ltd, The
Samaggi Insurance Public Company Ltd, The Siam City Insurance Company
Ltd, The Thai Commercial Insurance Public Co Ltd, and Thai Insurance
Public Co Ltd.

The venture has now received government approval.  Swiss Re will own
49% of the new company, and the ten local companies 5.1% each.  Thus
the company elegantly overcomes legal restrictions in Thailand, which
make it nearly impossible to set up a branch office in the country.
Swiss Re said "the partners aim to enhance reinsurance know-how and
related services in the Thai marketplace" through the venture.

In addition, the insurance authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore have
approved Swiss Re's plans to upgrade its local representative offices
to branches.  Following the start-up of operations in Bangkok towards
the end of this month, Swiss Re will be represented by eight offices in
Asia.  In addition to the outposts in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Manila,
Singapore, Taipei, Seoul and Beijing, offices are planned for Kuala
Lumpur, Shanghai and Jakarta.  The company is also closely watching
Vietnam and might enter that market soon, too, according to spokesman
Hermann Hefti.  At present the Swiss Re group as a whole writes about
SF1.4bn to SF1.5bn (US$1.2bn to $1.3bn) in the Asia Pacific region,
some 10% to 12% of its income, Mr Hefti said.

in the investment and strategic alliance agreement between AIG and 20th
Century, which was approved by 20th Century's shareholders in December.

CIGNA

Linda Kaiser, the insurance commissioner of Pennsylvania, is to deliver
her decision on the proposed restructuring of CIGNA Corp, Philadelphia,
shortly after 12 January.  Despite three public hearings, American
International Group Inc (AIG), New York, Chubb Group, Warren NJ, and St
Paul Fire & Marine, St Paul MN, are still fiercely contesting CIGNA's
plans on the grounds that they are unfair, illegal and not in the
interests of policyholders because all of the documentation supporting
them has not been made available.  CIGNA has responded that the only
documents kept out of the public domain had been those which contained
information about policyholders currently in litigation over asbestos
or environmental claims.

-  CIGNA has been fined US$442,500 by the Insurance Department of
California for ratings errors and violations in its documentation after
it was discovered that the insurer had failed to file proper rate
increase applications for 255 of 468 policies, thereby overcharging a
small number of clients by US$1.3m.  CIGNA has repaid over $1m in
refunds to twenty Californian  mainly D&O policyholders.

GAN

Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), Paris, intends to dispose of up
to Fr9bn (US$1.8bn) in additional assets to meet its debts and the cost
of its defeasance operations.  As part of this programme chairman Jean-
Jacques Bonnaud said that GAN was willing in principle to give up its
majority stake in banking subsidiary Credit Industrial et Commercial
(CIC), the first time that GAN has publicly acknowledged that its
shareholding in CIC could fall below 50%.

M Bonnaud said that the state had endorsed plans for GAN's
restructuring prior to sale at a board meeting in December.  He had
taken the acceleration in asset disposals to mean a greater commitment
towards privatization on the part of the government, and suggested 1997
as a possible date.  Additional assets to be sold off have yet to be
decided, with sales to take place over the next four to five years.

joint provisional liquidators of Hawk Insurance Co Ltd, London, by the
High Court on the company's own winding-up petition.  Hawk, a
subsidiary of Al-Ahleia Insurance Co SAK, Safat, ceased underwriting in
1976 and has been in run-off since.  Its directors recently established
that the amount due on claims was larger than expected, to the point
where the insurer was no longer able to meet its obligations.  The
possibility of a scheme of arrangement will be investigated, with
initial findings towards the end of January.

HDI/CITIBANK/TRANSATLANTISCHE

HDI Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie Versicherungsverein aG,
Hanover, appears to be on the verge of a major alliance with another
mutual, with a candidate most likely to be found in the life sector.
According to WICR's correspondent in Germany, this is the conclusion
which can be drawn from the reorganisation initiated by HDI, and from
remarks by chief executive Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl.

HDI has been busy in recent months.  It has signed a wide-ranging co-
operation deal with Citibank Privatkunden AG and Citicorp Deutschland
AG and, with effect from 1 January, took over the German insurance
operations of Citibank, Citi Lebensversicherung AG and Citi
Versicherung AG, both Dusseldorf.  It acquired Transatlantische
Lebensversicherungs-AG (Transleben), Hamburg, in December from Lloyds
Abbey Life plc, Weybridge, which it will merge with its own life
company, HDI Lebensversicherung AG.  However, the company's life
business itself will be moved away from that company into a new,
Hamburg-based life insurer, leaving HDI Leben as an empty shell with a
considerable tax-loss to carry forward.  HDI Leben will be renamed and
converted into a sub-holding under the parent HDI VVaG, and into which
all operational insurance interests outside the actual HDI VVaG will be
bundled, including those of reinsurer Hannover Ruckversicherung AG,
Hanover, and its subsidiary Eisen und Stahl Ruckversicherung AG.

Such a setup (parental mutuals, sub-holding for other interests) is the
classic model for a "Gleichordnungskonzern", a group formed of two
mutuals which cannot formally merge.  The group is then held together
by a joint management for both, and by stakes in the sub-holding, into
which the mutuals bring their non-mutualised insurance business.  Mr
Baumgartl does not deny that this could be a model and although he says
that there are "no current talks going on", it seems likely that such a
move towards an alliance with a life mutual would not be unwelcome to
him.

Following the signing of the deal with Citibank, Mr Baumgartl said that
"In order to be a global player on the life market, you need premium
income of about DM2bn" (US$1.4bn).  His present life companies are far
short of that: to 30 November, Citi Leben reported premium income of
DM322m for 1995, so the total for the year will be below DM400m.
Transleben reported DM216m for 1994, and the 1995 total is likely to be
below DM300m.  HDI's own life company is still struggling with the
problems of being relatively new, and premium income will total only
DM36m. Together, therefore, the whole HDI life group will write not
more than DM650m - and it is difficult to see where HDI will gain the
DM2bn it is seeking, if Mr Baumgartl does not have a major partnership
up his sleeve.

The deal with Citibank was not surprising, and aimed as much at volume
as the sales channels offered by the two companies.  Citi Leben has a
total life portfolio of DM16.7bn and Citi Versicherung gross premium of
DM23.5m.  The former Citibank insurers will continue as companies in
their own right, and will change their names to CiV Lebensversicherung
AG and CiV Versicherung AG.  Product names like "Citi Leben Plus 4"
will also remain unchanged, and policies will continue to be sold
exclusively through the sales channels of Citibank Privatkunden.  Those
channels - reaching at present about 2.5m customers - were of key
importance for HDI, Mr Baumgartl stressed.  "That is why we were only
interested in an exclusive and long-term cooperation with Citibank.
Without Citibank's salesforce, the two insurers would be of no value
for us!" he said, adding that by co-operating with Citibank, HDI had
completed its range of distribution channels.  HDI had no interest in
becoming an Allfinanz group, Mr Baumgartl said.

HDI will sell banking products exclusively for Citibank, and in return
Citibank will only offer CiV and other HDI policies in the insurance
sector.  Mr Baumgartl said that there would be no assimilation between
the Citi and HDI products.  "The CiV products will remain tailor-made
for Citibank's demands," he said

According to Mr Baumgartl, HDI's moves to strengthen its life business
were needed to counterbalance the sharp swings in the profits of the
industrial, motor and portfolios which were the group's major lines of
business.  "What we need is the broad private life business with a
relatively balanced development," he said.

The HDI deal with Lloyds Abbey Life was also confirmed in December, at
a price of about DM110m, according to sources at Lloyds Abbey Life.
The company has life business in force of about DM7.2bn.  For 1995, the
company again forecasts losses, although the expected DM7m is a strong
improvement over the DM11m loss in 1994.  Transleben, which
concentrates on broker-produced business, has suffered from high
cancellation ratios.  In 1992, it began a reorganisation, including a
drastic restructuring of its sales network.  HDI said that its 1995
premium income rose 9% from DM2.78bn to DM3.03bn, with motor being the
main earner, up by 140,000 risks to 1.8m at the year-end, and giving
HDI a market share of 4% - one of the winners in the present price war.
 1995 motor results had been excellent, but following massive price
cuts, an underwriting loss was likely for 1996.  Industrial fire, too,
was suffering from weaker prices, board member Gunter Wager said.

HDI officials confirmed that the company is one of four insurers
bidding for the business acquired by the UK's Automobile Association
(AA) from its members, more than 1m policies a year. Originally, HDI
had been the only bidder.  They also indicated that the acquisition of
a small insurer in Italy was likely soon, but did not specify any
candidate.

INDEPENDENT/LA PALATINE

Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs-AG, Aachen, has finally managed to
rid itself of La Palatine Assurance SA, Suresnes, the source of much
distress for another of its more recent disposals, Aachener
Ruckversicherungs-Ges AG (Aachen Re), Aachen.  Independent Insurance
Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Independent Insurance Group plc, London,
has taken over Palatine from Groupement Francais d'Assurances IARD
(GFA), Suresnes.  GFA was a subsidiary of the old Aachen Re, which has
now been renamed AM Konzernruckversicherung AG after being transformed
into a purely in-house reinsurer.

GFA has transferred a major portion of its business to Palatine and
sold this business with the company.  Palatine has been active in the
French personal lines market since 1990 and has mainly sold motor,
property and accident policies via brokers and multiple agents.  The
net assets of Palatine were worth Fr35m (US$7.1m) on transfer to
Independent, which secured guarantees particularly regarding reserve
adequacy and Fr140m in order to restructure Palatine.

KANSA

Former managers of the bankrupt Kansa Pension Insurance Co. Ltd (Elake-
Kansa), Helsinki, were served with writs for damages towards the end of
December, the last possible moment before the statute of limitations
took effect (WICR159/24).  The suits, covering events in 1992, sought
an estimated FM240m (US$55.2m).  Liquidators are suing, among other
things, over property deals which were allegedly sometimes approved by
the boards in retrospect, and sometimes with not all board members
present at crucial meetings.  Further suits could follow concerning
events in 1993 and 1994, and these could raise the claims to FM1bn.
One matter awaiting clarification is the disappearance of FM700m in the
summer of 1993, without the authorisation of the board.

Seven of the Kansa companies have been the subject of extraordinary
audits and all of them are nearly complete.  The administrators have
asked some of the larger creditors for comments, which are expected
this month, but should not change the assessment of management's
responsibilities.  The auditors' reports have also been submitted to
the insurance department of the ministry of social affairs and health.

The bankrupt companies are Elake-Kansa, Kansa Life Insurance Co Ltd
(Henki-Kansa), Helsinki, two reinsurers, Kansa International Corp,
Kansy-yhtyma, and Finansipalveluosakeyhtio Kansa.  The pension company
is in the worst financial condition, with non-guaranteed credits, and a
deficit of around FM1bn (WICR159/24).  The situation of Henki-Kansa
appears better, but depends heavily on the outcome of the legal action.
 Indeed, the state of both companies will only be clear when the legal
actions have been settled, and decided which assets belong to which
company.  The general aim is to reduce the deficits of the bankrupt
companies through selling the Kansa Group's US-based subsidiary
Clarendon Group.  According to Mr Jaatinen the sale is progressing, and
should be finalised during 1996.

LIMIT

London Insurance Market Investment Trust plc (LIMIT), London, has
increased its capacity allocated to the Lloyd's market by 5.2% to
#610.25m (US$946m) for 1996.  The increase means that LIMIT now writes
6.5% of Lloyd's total capacity.  LIMIT said that it will be providing
capacity to two syndicates which it has not previously supported,
#0.25m going to non-marine (mainly nuclear risks) syndicate 1176 (Cox
Newton & Harman Ltd) and #3m to syndicate 1206 managed by Owen & Wilby
Underwriting Agency Ltd, a new managing agent for 1996 formed to manage
the syndicate which will be similar to that of syndicate 718 in the
sphere of accident & health risks, with the exception that no London
market reinsurance risks will be written.

NATIONAL (CALCUTTA)

National Insurance Co Ltd, Calcutta, introduced India's first package
insurance policy for farmers in West Bengal on 25 November.  Union
Minister of State for Finance, Dr Debiprosad Pad, described the scheme
as a significant milestone and urged the other insurance companies to
introduce similar policies.  The scheme will be extended to other areas
if it proves successful in West Bengal.  The package covers 12 frequent
hazards in rural areas, including fire and allied, burglary, electronic
equipment such as TVs and VCRs, bicycles, livestock, poultry and
handcarts.  The fire and burglary sections are compulsory, with an
annual premium of Rs152.50.  Taking five or more sections generates a
premium discount of 15% to 20%.

ORIENTAL

Oriental Insurance Co Ltd (OIC), New Delhi, closed the year 1994-95
with an overall profit of Rs437.1m (US$12.3m).  Motor claims cost it
Rs1,950m.  Chairman KC Mittal said that although there was an
underwriting loss of Rs1,307.9m for the year after a profit of Rs118.5m
in 1993-4, this was essentially due to provisions for motor TPL claims
of Rs5,040m on 21 March 1995, compared with Rs2,730m int he previous
year, and resulting from changes to the Motor Vehicles Act and a trend
towards higher awards by claims tribunals.  He described MTPL claims as
"a bleeding wound" for the company and said there was a dire need for
increasing the third party insurance premium for buses and trucks.

Gross domestic premium income was about Rs11bn, up from Rs10.06bn.
Results in both fire and marine had substantially improved.  Foreign
operations in Nepal, Kuwait and Dubai yielded a revenue surplus of
Rs14.2m against a deficit of Rs40.8m.  Total investment earnings
increased by 20.9% to Rs1,785.1m.

PROVINZIAL

German insurance agents are becoming increasingly worried about the
trend for established agency distribution insurers to set up direct
sales operations.  The agents' association Bundesverband Deutscher
Versicherungskaufleute said that more and more companies were becoming
"unfaithful".  The latest example was the plan of the Rhineland savings
banks, represented by Rheinischer Sparkassen- und Giroverband, together
with Provinzial Feuerversicherungsanstalt der Rheinprovinz, Dusseldorf,
to set up "S Direkt" in Spring this year to offer cheap motor cover.
According to a marketing analysis undertaken by the initiators, 14% of
potential customers were prepared to sign up with a direct sale
insurer.  The idea is also to increase penetration: while the 52
savings banks have a market share of close to 50% of households,
Provinzial has only 9%.  The savings banks will in future be major
shareholders of Provinzial.

director Seppo Raty, and customer finance director Kari Vihurila, for
bribery for allegedly trying to influence the outcome of the bids for
covering the insurance risks of the City of Vantaa in 1994.  They are
alleged to have granted a loan to a company indirectly owned by Raimo
Salmivuo, who was chairman of the city council at the time.  The
accused deny the charges, and say that Yritys-Sampo bid for the
business was the best according to objective criteria and that any
loans made to Mr Salmivuo were on normal market conditions.  A hearing

SKANDIA

Forsakrings AB Skandia, Stockholm, offshoot Skandia Assurance &
Financial Services (AFS), which runs around 400 unit-liked insurance
funds, has set up a service company on the offshore tax haven of
Labuan, as well as in Borneo, which is currently home to 560 offshore
companies and 46 banks.  Skandia AFS South East Asia will be the
company's largest sales office in SE Asia, targetting Indonesia, the
Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, and
Korea.

Elsewhere in Asia, the group has Royal Skandia in Hong Kong, which
sells unit-linked policies to expatriates working in the colony.
Skandia Asia chairman Bjorn Hall has forecast that pension monies would
grow by between 4% and 5% in real terms in the markets of Hong Kong,
China, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia Thailand, Korea, the
Philippines, and Australia in the coming years, and described India,
Burma, Sri Lanka and Cambodia as other up and coming markets.

Closer to home, Skandia's board has decided to take a more active role
as shareholder.  It will press for the establishment of nominating
committees, which propose candidates to boards, advise on their
remuneration, and propose auditors, in all joint stock companies.
Skandia will also encourage companies to give shareholders more
opportunity to prepare themselves for their AGMs by announcing them a
month in advance and publishing an agenda.  With over 30% of the
Stockholm stock exchange value in foreign hands, this should include an
English translation.

TRYGG-HANSA

Trygg-Hansa AB, Stockholm, is aiming to double its premium income over
the next four years.  Ceo Lars Thunell believes that Swedish insurers
face tough competition from niche and foreign companies, and to survive
must halve their costs.  His method will be to double income while
holding expenses unchanged.  To achieve this, Mr Thunell plans new
distribution channels, simplifying products, improving services to
larger customers, as well as international expansion.  For the non-life
market the watchwords will be simplification and standardised products.
 Mr Thunell was resigned to slow progress at home, "nibbling half a
percent a year" in Sweden.  In addition, non-life products would
increasingly be sold by telephone and over the Internet, which should
allow penetration into Finland and Norway.  Slightly further afield, Mr
Thunell believed that the future markets were in the Baltic area.

Many of the lucrative opportunities were in the life market, he said,
as cutbacks in Sweden's social security and pension system opened the
way for new products combining savings and insurance.  This was a
further reason for the joint stock company (Trygg-Hansa AB)
strengthening its grip on Trygg-Hansa Liv (WICR177/18, 178/23, 183/22).
 A major step towards this consolidation was taken when the shareholder
agreement between SPP and Trygg-Hansa Liv was dissolved in late
December (WICR183/22).  This agreement involved Trygg-Hansa Liv and SPP
undertaking not to sell shares to third parties before the year 2000,
and thereafter offering first refusal to the other until 2010.

This paved the way for Trygg-Hansa Liv to pay SK626.5m (US$94.7m) to
buy 632,000 A shares and 5m B shares of Trygg Hansa AB from SPP.
Together with its existing holding of 19.4% of capital and 28.1% of
votes, this will give Trygg-Hansa Liv all of the 2m A shares in Trygg-
Hansa AB, and leave it with 26.2% of the capital in the company and
39.2% of the votes.  Trygg-Hansa Liv's chairman Gosta Wiking indicated
that the life company did not intend to take up any more Trygg-Hansa AB
shares, so that the outstanding packets were large enough to be
attractive to other institutional investors.

SPP still holds 16,447,512 B shares in Trygg Hansa AB, which have a
market value of around SK1.8bn at a market price of around SK110 a
share.  SPP has already adjusted these to SK98 per share on its balance
sheet (from SK 80), and a substantial proportion is likely to be sold.
The 16.44m shares represent 19.9% of Trygg-Hansa AB's capital and 16.3%
of the votes.  SPP spokesman Klas Rasater indicated that SPP was
unlikely to want to retain more than 5% in the long term.

Cie UAP SA, Paris, and Interamerican Holding have announced that they
are to reorganise their current shareholding relationship within a
general co-operation agreement.  UAP will sell its 40% stake in
Interamerican Holding, which controls the interests of Interamerican
Property & Casualty Insurance Co, Athens, to Europolitan, Luxembourg.
Simultaneously, UAP's subsidiary Banque Worms, already a majority
shareholder in Interamerican Group member Interbank with 60%, will
become the sole shareholder.  The agreement will enable the
Interamerican Group and Interbank to enhance their joint capacity for
selling insurance products and banking services.  The Interamerican
Group will remain the representative of UAP in Greece.

UAP is proceeding with the restructuring of some of its main businesses
into two holding companies as announced at the end of last year
(WICR183/22).  UAP France became effective on 28 December 1995, and its
board met for the time on 3 January.

The minister of economy and finance (MoF) has also agreed to the
formation of UAP Collectives, which will be responsible for group life
within UAP France.  The MoF also authorised the transfer to it of the
portfolios of group assurance policies from UAP-Vie and UAP Incendie-
Accidents as of 1 January.

UK P&I

Members of the United Kingdom Mutual Steam Ship Assurance Association

favour of the International Group of P&I Club's proposal to limit each
member's liability to pay catastrophe calls to 20% of an owner's
limitation fund for property damage claims under the 1976 Limitation
Convention.  This will result in a potential total claim on all members
in the International Group of between US$18bn and $20bn.  It must be
accepted by a minimum of ten clubs in the International Group,
representing at least 85% of International Group's tonnage.  According
to the UK Club, a number of other clubs are holding meetings of members
along the same lines, with a representative picture of shipowners'
views hopefully becoming apparent by the end of January.  The
proposals, if approved by all members of the group, will be adopted for
the policy year commencing 20 February.

WEST OF ENGLAND

The West of England Ship Owners Mutual Insurance Association
(Luxembourg) has warned that an "even greater level of self-insurance
is the only option" for members of the International Group if
uncertainty surrounding the future of the Lloyd's market continues and
no viable alternative is found.  In its annual review for 1995 the club
said that concerns remained about the International Group's heavy
dependence upon Lloyd's, which still writes up to 80% of the combined
layer of the International Group's reinsurance contract.  While there
had been "some optimism during recent months that Lloyd's would be
restructured", delays in Equitas meant that there was continuing
uncertainty over the future of the leading reinsurer for the club and
the Group and the prospect that "even greater levels of risk will have
to be retained within the industry", it said.

P&I providers could not expect to be immune from the type of litigation
that has "so bedevilled" the Lloyd's market over the past few years.
One way to prevent or defeat such litigation was for a club's
underwriters and committee to have a basic underwriting plan which
analysed potential exposure, laid down a policy to limit that exposure
acceptable to its members and then communicated that policy to them.
The club said that "unless and until the International Group introduces
a realistic limit on cover, a major overspill claim would inevitably
lead to litigation."  While the International Group had recognised the
need for limiting catastrophe liability calls to an "economically
collectable" level, its intention to have that level determined by an
independent expert after an event was troubling.  The club suggested
that a glance at the Lloyd's experience of trying to collect monies
owed from names would provide a "salutary lesson" to the International
Group about such a course.

Another challenge lay in the International Group's own Pooling
arrangements.  Since the individual club retention had increased
substantially in recent years from $1.2m per loss in 1989 to $5m in
1995, it was possible that the pattern of development of incurred pool
claims data will be different to that of the 1980s.  Whereas a claim
for $900,000 would have taken less time to appear in the pool, in 1995
a significant loss might take much longer to develop to the point where
it will concern the pool.  Claims information may therefore appear
unnecessarily optimistic.  The West of England concluded that "time
alone will tell", but urged club underwriters to take measures to
ensure that any negative impact may be minimalised.

COLONIA LEBEN

Colonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL), Cologne, is set to turn its
Deutsche Crzte-Versicherung (DCV) branch operation into a company in
its own right.  According to its chairman, Carl Hermann Schleifer, CL
was currently discussing the legal and fiscal aspects of the
separation.  "By carrying out the spin-off, we break new ground," Dr
Schleifer said.  DCV will receive one-third of CL's existing portfolio,
which totalled DM62.5bn (US$43bn) at the end of 1995.  Dr Schleifer was
confident that a satisfactory solution would be found by this Spring,
and that DCV will then be turned into a separate joint stock company
retroactively from 1 January.  One major problem seems to be the offer
that has to be made to independent CL shareholders.

It is expected that DCV will eventually seek close co-operation with
Deutsche Apotheker-und Crztebank, Dusseldorf, the specialised bank for
the medical professions.  The small property and casualty unit Deutsche
Crzte-Versicherung Allgemeine AG, Cologne, which is already
independent, would not be affected by the separation.

Dr Schleifer, who also heads Nordstern Lebensversicherungs-AG and
private health insurer Colonia Krankenversicherung AG, also announced
another project of holding company CKAG Colonia Konzern AG,
establishment of a specialised consultancy and sales organisation to
concentrate on investments for customers over the age of 45.  A sales
force was currently being recruited in the banking sector who would not
only sell CKAG life insurance, but also funds, investment certificates
and other products.  Dr Schleifer said that former majority owner
Bankhaus Sal Oppenheim would certainly be a co-operation partner for
the new project, but that CKAG was also negotiating with other banks.
He added that the new organisation was one step in CKAG's strategy of
aiming at a new target group, the generation of the "young elderly".

Dr Schleifer displayed optimism regarding the prospects of life
business in Germany.  In his view life insurers would again benefit
from an improved economic environment and record growth in new business
in 1996.  He expects new business for both companies to rise by about
7% in 1996.  One major factor for the upturn would be the estimated
rise in the purchasing power of German consumers, which was expected to
be up by DM11bn (US$7.65bn) on 1995.  Germans were becoming
increasingly aware of the value of life policies as a provision for
their old age, Dr Schleifer said, adding that German life insurers had
not felt any effect from foreign competitors offering life policies in
the German market hitherto.  In his view, European Monetary Union would
bring no disadvantages for German insureds.

In 1995, Colonia Lebensversicherung AG (CL) suffered an 8.7% decline in
new business to DM7.5bn in sums insured.  "The market as a whole
anticipates a 13% fall in new business, so Colonia held firm and gained
market share," Dr Schleifer said.  He expected premium income for the
year to rise by 5.2% to DM1.9bn.  The cancellation ratio deteriorated
by 0.1 points to 4.7%, "but is still markedly below the market average
of above 6%", he said.  Sales by pyramid-sales company Proventus AG,
Bremen, accounted for less than 10% of newly sold business.  The
organisation did particularly well in selling private health cover in
eastern Germany.  "Overall, we are very satisfied with this sales
channel," Dr Schleifer said.

CL's cost ratio improved from 3.8% to 3.7%, mainly as a result of the
merger of the Colonia and Nordstern back-offices.  Dr Schleifer
expected a gross profit of DM593m for Colonia Life, up 4.4%.  Sister
company Nordstern Leben (NL) will outperform the rest of the market in
1995, the ceo said.  It maintained new business at the 1994 level, with
DM4.7bn in sums insured.  Premium income was expected to rise by 14% to
DM1.4bn, compared with an average growth of 7% in the German market,
although the cancellation ratio worsened from 3.7% to 4.3%.  NL's gross
profit will rise from DM276.7m in 1994 to an expected DM315m.

ELAKE-SAMPO

The boards of Sampo Pension Insurance Co Ltd (Elake-Sampo), Helsinki,
and Pension-Varma Mutual Insurance Co (Elake-Varma), Helsinki, aborted
their planned transfer of insurance portfolios after failing to agree
on what form the reorganisation would take and methods of calculating
profits from the assets (WICR181/23).  The regulator, the ministry of
social affairs and health, had insisted on unanimity over the merger
arrangements as a precondition of its own approval.  A joint communique
stressed that auditors had found that there were no significant
differences in the financial situations of the companies, a move
designed to quash doubts over the soundness of the financial position
of Elake-Varma.

According to unofficial reports, one bone of contention was that Elake-
Varma wanted to assume a 10% future yield on shares, which others
considered unrealistic.  There were also differences over how to
estimate profits from hydro-electric power stations, which tend to be
heavily influenced by inflation expectations.  Elake-Varma owns several
such plants.  Consequently, there was some incredulity when the company
announced that the surplus of its insurance and investment activities
would increase from around FM40m (US$9.2m) for 1994 to nearly FM270m.

Elake-Varma managing director Paavo Pitkanen declined to speculate
whether another attempt to reorganise the two companies would be made,
while Elake-Sampo managing director Risto Kausto considered the matter
closed.

The other merger within the Sampo group, that of Kaleva Mutual
Insurance Co., Helsinki, and Nova Life Insurance Co Ltd, Helsinki, is
to proceed.

R+V

Germany's highest administrative court Bundesverwaltungsgericht in
Berlin, has issued an important ruling affecting demutualisation in the
country.  The court said that the German insurance supervision
Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Versicherungswesen (BAV), Berlin, had acted
correctly when it allowed the 1989 transfer of the life portfolio from
the mutual R+V Lebensversicherungsverein aG to the joint stock company
R+V Lebensversicherung AG, Wiesbaden.

Several insureds of the old mutual had taken legal action against BAV,
complaining that the compensation paid to members was too low and did
not take the hidden reserves of the mutual adequately into account.  At
that time, a total of DM218m (US$152m) was paid to members to
compensate for their loss of that status.  The plaintiffs argued that
the hidden reserves totalled "a multiple" of that sum.

The court said that the BAV had taken sufficient care of the interests
of policyholders.  The legal and effective material situation of the
plaintiffs had not been worsened to a noteworthy degree.  As far as
they had suffered losses at all, they had been compensated.  The
transfer of the portfolio was no reason to dissolve the hidden
reserves.  The BAV's agreement to the deal did not prevent members from
suing for higher compensation.

The judgement is of considerable importance because it eases the
transformation from mutuals to joint stock companies.  Many mutuals
suffer from inadequate equity, and must increase capital through
profits.  The EU directive on the solvency of insurance groups which is
in preparation would aggravate the problem for life mutuals, as
reserves for premium repayments to policyholders would no longer count
as equity.
