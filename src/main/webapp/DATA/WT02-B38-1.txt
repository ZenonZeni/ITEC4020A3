TRENDWATCH:  BANKS FEAR RE-FINANCING OF SMALL BUSINESSES

THE YOUNG Thai banker was despondent. "The board thinks that anyone
seeking re-financing is potentially a bad debt case," he said,
recounting how the bank's board turned down a package he put together
to re-finance the business of a small property company.

"The company was paying 17 percent to a finance company for a 700
million baht ($16 million) project. They have had a five-year track
record of on-time payment," the banker said.

There was also a strong fee-based component. He had proposed a 400
million baht facility at 15 percent per annum, with a 1 percent
up-front fee and a 40 million baht revolving facility at half a
percentage maintenance fee per month.

The banker reckoned the deal was turned down because of his bank's
strongly conservative culture. A lack of competitiveness in the Thai
banking industry preclude large and established banks from moving
aggressively to capture new businesses away from other banks.

Around the region, sustained economic growth averaging 10 percent in
much of Asia has been creating a strong cohort of well-run small
businesses in growth industries.

A senior Malaysian banker told Asian Banker, "typically, a small
business that is begun with little more than the wits of the
entrepreneur would turn to factoring to manage its cash flow. A low end
financial institution may also be interested."

A Filipino banker admitted: "Often, it's a case of us not understanding
their business. In the Philippines, we'd rather lend to the
co-operatives who, in turn, lend to these small businesses." But even
with a strong track record, they continue to be viewed suspiciously by
bankers.

Finance companies in Malaysia and Thailand charge up to 4 percent over
published prime rates. When Filipino banks do lend directly to small
businesses, the rates are exorbitant, at 7 percent-8 percent over
prime.

The problem is that by the time these small businesses reach a stage of
maturity to warrant the interest of banks, the competition would have
become very tough. Competition at a mature stage is not only between
banks, but with non-bank financial institutions, the venture
capitalists, merchant banks and even other corporations.

Malaysia appears to have the most progressive environment of
competitive re-financing in the region. "Nobody advertises it aloud,"
the Malaysian banker said,"but it sometimes goes down to the level of a
bank asking to see the letter-of-offer of the original financier and
simply substituting that with a better offer." He joked that if the
original bank had a good reputation, the competitor would not need to
bother doing its own due diligence.

In Singapore and Hong Kong, government incentives play a critical role
in getting favourable terms for targeted small businesses they want to
promote. Singapore banks charge as low as a quarter percent over prime
for loans under the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme.

While the rates are attractive, such loans come with conditions that
can be restrictive if a company proves to grow very fast. What is
needed is a banking community that is as nimble as the fast-footed
entrepreneurs who are creating the economic miracles in the region.

CENTRAL BANKS RELY ON REGIONAL CO-OPERATION

Given that the world's three largest economies, the US, Japan and
Germany, have never been completely successful at thwarting speculative
assault against their currencies, what chance do five of the region's
central banks stand of doing so?

RECENTLY, five members of the 11-member Executive Meeting of East Asian
and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), namely Australia, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, took the unprecedented step of
signing a series of bilateral "repo" agreements. The Monetary Authority
of Singapore, while deciding not to join its members, also set up
similar arrangements on a bilateral basis with the central banks of
Thailand and Indonesia to ameliorate the volatile influence of global
capital flows on exchange-rates.

The bilateral pacts, although not a carte blanc for central banks to
tap into the reserves of their neighbours, nevertheless allow signatory
countries to borrow from one another to boost their reserves in times
of crisis. This was in reflection of the Mexican peso crisis that led
to speculative assaults on a number of regional currencies.
Technically, it formally contracts the parties to raise US dollars from
one another against US Treasury securities.

Market watchers, however, are not convinced that these agreements will
result in central banks pooling their foreign exchange reserves.
Analysts highlighted the fact that the effectiveness of such measures
against potentially disruptive market speculation has never been put to
the test. It would certainly be sensible to think that no currency
would ever be immune to"attacks".

Economists say that the soundness of macroeconomic fundamentals and
policy prudence remain the ultimate guarantors of exchange system
stability. In its weekly economic update, the Union Bank of Switzerland
noted that even G3 (Japan, Germany and the US) co-ordinated
intervention works best when it aims to support market moves.

In a recent speech calling for greater co-operation between Asia's
central banks, Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, said the Mexican episode was a wakening bell to Asian
central bankers. This, he said, has made central bankers wonder: what
has changed for Asian monetary stability? What has remained the same?
What needs to change?

Yam believes that with open capital accounts, and significant foreign
direct and portfolio investments pouring into Asia, Asian currencies
have become susceptible to the global ebb and flow of financial
resources.

Players have also changed. The commercial bankers, who have always had
branches and offices in Asia, understand the region well. On the other
hand, new actors have appeared on centre stage in the last five years.
Securities houses, pension and mutual funds, investment banks and also
hedge funds have appeared in Asian markets.

In the face of these developments, central bankers believe that the
ability of central banks to stabilise exchange rates seems to have
slipped from their grasp. However, Yam noted that the sound
fundamentals in the Asian markets still hold.

What has also remained the same is that, as lenders of last resort,
central banks are in a position to dictate terms when eventually they
are asked to lend domestic currencies directly or indirectly to
speculators shorting their currencies.

In the aftermath of the Mexico crisis, an informal meeting of some of
the region's central banks concluded that it would be useful to
exchange information on market activities, to monitor the markets more
closely, to share knowledge and techniques on overall financial market
supervision, and to immunise the pain tolerance levels of the economy
in case it becomes necessary to inflict pain on the speculators.

At present, most Asian economies are keeping their exchange rates at a
low level in order to ensure export competitiveness. The most obvious
manifestation of this is reflected in the increase in the reserves of
some economies as a result of direct central bank intervention to hold
down their currencies.

Economists point to the fact that in terms of purchasing-power
parities, most Asian currencies, including those of China, India and
Thailand, are still grossly undervalued.

Another factor which impinges on the stability of some of the region's
exchange rates is the fact that most economies in the region are
growing huge current account deficits. However, current account
deficits in Asia mostly reflect foreign capital inflows which fuel
development.

The argument is that if these are mainly short-term portfolio capital,
then it is better to allow reserves to grow, as opposed to allowing an
increase in the exchange rate which may later fall when these
short-term capital flow elsewhere.

In the case of more long-term capital inflow, then a stronger exchange
rate is not such a bad proposition at all. However, the problem of
losing export competition due to a stronger currency will come back to
haunt the governments.

In the aftermath of the peso crisis last year, Indonesian stocks fell
to six-month lows amid concern that speculators were going to target
the rupiah. In the Philippines, the central bank raised rates to defend
the peso.

However, some feel that the move suggests inherent weaknesses in their
currencies. Some say that it only serves to raise more concerns in the
minds of investors, making matters worse not better.

HONG KONG FIRST TO GO RTGS

Nearly 30 years after banks in the US have been processing payments on
a real time basis, banks in Asia have finally taken the same route

THE HONG Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is confident that the colony's
high value transaction payment system will be able to go real time by
the end of this year. Almost all banks in Asia still settle their
interbank cheques and other payments mostly on a net overnight basis.
The system to be used by the HKMA will be similar to that used by the
Federal Reserves Board in the US, called FedWire.

While the US FedWire System has been settling payments on an Real Time
Gross Settlements (RTGS) system since 1968 and the Swiss have been
doing it since 1987, the HKMA began looking into this faster and safer
system to deal with rising interbank exposures only in 1993.

"The adoption of RTGS will immediately eliminate most of the legal
risks associated with bilateral or multi-lateral netting," Joseph Yam,
chief executive of HKMA, said at a payments system seminar organised by
the agency in Hong Kong late last year. "Settlement across the books of
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will eliminate any doubt over credit
risks associated with commercial banks acting as settlement
institutions, however prudently these commercial banks are run."

RTGS enables settlements to be made on a payment-versus-payment basis
(see definitions box), so that there is virtually no exposure between
institutions at any point in the day. Experts believe that this in turn
eliminates what is known in large payment systems circles as "Herstatt
Risk". Coined in reference to the situation that arose from a major
settlement failure in the past, Herstatt Risk arises in foreign
exchange transactions when one counterparty delivers currency in one
time zone and receives value in the other currency in another time
zone. The risk arises out of the possibility that the counterparty who
delivers later may fail to settle.

According to Yam, Hong Kong adopted a "single tier architecture,
instead of the present three tier one, with every bank settling
directly across the books". The HKMA also plans to integrate its
Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) service, which is its book entry
securities system, directly with the RTGS system. So daylight
overdrafts incurred by the banks at the clearing account with the HKMA
will be fully collateralised with the Exchange Fund paper on a repo
(sell and buy-back) basis.

Yam believes that Hong Kong will be the first to settle its moneymarket
deals on this basis. "As far as I know, our RTGS system is one of the
first to be engineered with a seamless integration between the
settlement function and the government securities book entry function.
We will be happy to share our technical specifications on this and
other features with other central banks."

In December, it introduced the first of a series of enhancements for
its CMU by making it possible for end-of-day delivery versus payment
(DvP) facility for private sector debt securities lodged and cleared
with the CMU.

In January this year, the CMU announced it is also able to clear
foreign currency debt securities. "So far, the CMU only accepts Hong
Kong dollar debt securities because the CMU service is designed and set
up to promote the Hong Kong dollar debt market," Yam said. "However,
there is no reason why the CMU, which is already linked up with
EuroClear and Cedel, cannot widen its coverage to debt securities
denominated in foreign currency."

The DvP function will be made available to all CMU instruments,
including exchange fund bills and notes, private sector debt
securities, on a real time and end-of-day settlement basis when the
entire RTGS system goes live at the end of 1996.

Hong Kong chose to build its RTGS settlement system on top of its
existing large value fund transfer system called CHATS. The decision to
build on CHATS was taken because it would have taken a long time to
build a new system from scratch and also because it was possible to
build on a system that banks in Hong Kong were already familiar with.
The new RTGS system would have clocked a mere 24 months in installation
time.

Small banks are able to access the HKMA's RTGS using a simple personal
computer. It is also possible for the larger banks to interface their
own complex systems with RTGS through existing AS400 computer systems.

Introducing RTGS was especially tricky in Hong Kong as the colony's 180
licensed banks operate on a three tier clearing structure. The top
layer comprises Hong Kong Bank, which plays the role of the management
bank of the clearing house. Hong Kong Bank also owns and runs the
current CHATS system. The second layer comprises a number of settlement
banks and the third layer comprises the sub-settlement banks. The RTGS
system was implemented by a joint venture company called the Hong Kong
Inter-bank Clearing Limited, which is 50:50 owned by the HKMA and the
Hong Kong Association of Banks.

Hong Kong set the end of 1996 as the target to complete its RTGS system
for two reasons. The first reason being that the Federal Reserve Board
of the United States had already announced that the operating hours of
its own FedWire system was to be extended to 18 hours. As this would
extend the time into Asian trading hours, the HKMA wanted to have a
system that could complete cross-currency transactions on a
payment-versus-payment (PvP) basis.

The second reason was to tie in with the targeted completion of the
China National Automated Payment Systems for the renminbi in 1997. Both
the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi are important currencies, as the
Hong Kong dollar is linked to the US dollar based on a monetary policy
objective and to the renminbi through extensive trade.

RTGS on a global basis?

While daily inter-bank Hong Kong dollar transactions constitute $15
billion, foreign exchange transactions are in the order of $91 billion
a day. Although most Asian transactions are currently with US and
European counter-parties, the growth in intra-Asian trade is expected
to increase regional transactions tremendously.

Between 1990 and 1994, the number of SWIFT messages recording financial
flows around the world increased by 9.1 percent, but total messages for
the Asia Pacific region alone grew more than twice that rate at nearly
14.6 percent.

The question naturally arises if a global RTGS payment system will
arise any time soon. "A robust network of global cross-border payments
can only be built on robust domestic payment systems," Yam said. He
also thinks that some countries are ahead of others in this respect.

Yam believes that RTGS linkages between countries should be developed
on a bilateral, instead of a multi-lateral, basis. It is not possible
to internationalise or harmonise payment systems even among G10
countries because of different agendas in each of them. The legal and
structural constraints will be too many to handle all at once. "It is
in the two economies own direct interests to build a bilateral linkage
with each other, and this could be achieved with much greater ease."

Furthermore, PvP linkages are better achieved either indirectly via
private sector banks or directly with linkages of two RTGS systems
together. A US payment systems expert, Bruce Summers, recently proposed
that central banks can act as"matching agencies" by examining the
payments originated by users of the service and releasing such payments
only when a well-defined set of conditions are met. This method is one
way of reducing Herstatt risks without involving central banks in new
types of credit risks.

How the HKMA's RTGS System will work

HONG KONG'S new RTGS system will adopt a Y-shaped flow as indicated in
the diagram above. All banks will have direct access to the system. The
advantage of this flow method is to keep the system simple and direct.
There is no routing of information or value via any other intermediary.

A bank will send in its full payment instruction (including the value
and information on the customer) to a Central Transaction Processor.
The processor will"strip" the details of the customer. Only the
settlement instruction (i.e the information on the amount, the payee
and recipient banks) on the Settlement Account Processor will be passed
on to the Settlement Account Processor and known by the HKMA.

All payments will have to be settled on an individual and gross basis.
As the system will have no provisions for daylight overdraft, banks
without sufficient clearing balance (or securities for repos) will be
queued in the system until the bank meets the liquidity requirement.
All payments cleared by the HKMA will then be final and irrevocable.

Intra-day liquidity is created by the seamless integration with the
Central MoneyMarket Unit book entry securities clearing and settlement
system. This interface enables banks to develop same day repos.

INDONESIAN BANKS STILL VULNERABLE

Even as the government works at introducing prudential measures to
strengthen the country's banking industry, Indonesian banks still have
a long way to go, according to a recent report by Standard & Poor's

HIGH NON-PERFORMING assets continue to hang over Indonesia's banking
system. Rating agencies have flagged caution in dealing with the banks
in this country for at least five to seven years. Standard & Poor's
(S&P) notes that Indonesia's banking industry is underpinned by a
potentially more volatile, albeit developing, economy and should
attract more caution than the banking system of other countries.

At this stage of its economic development, Indonesia is overbanked,
said S&P in an assessment report. The industry has 240 commercial banks
with average assets per bank of $500 million. On an international
comparison, this implies an excess number of banks and a lack of
operating efficiency among small to mid-sized banks.

Recent data collated by Asian Banker suggest that in spite of the large
number of banks in Indonesia, the penetration level is still very low.
When viewed in the perspective of the archipelago's 17,000 islands and
190 million population, there are only 1.3 banks per million people and
24.3 branches per million.

This branch penetration level compares very poorly even with its
nearest comparison. The Philippines has a penetration of 41.8 branches
per million population. At the other end of the scale, Hong Kong has
the highest penetration with 261.4 branches per million.

The low branch penetration is matched by the extremely low average
asset size for Indonesian banks, which is a mere $0.66 billion per bank
branch as compared to $54.6 billion in Japan and $10.44 billion for
Thailand. The impression created by this data is that the basis for
concern should not be based on the asset quality of any one small
Indonesian bank but on the knock-on effect that any lack of confidence
would have.

It is exactly this concern that the rating agencies talk about.
Standard & Poor's believes that undercapitalisation of small banks may
have a knock-on effect on mid-sized banks. This is because the smaller
banks in Indonesia are in the practice of obtaining funds from the
larger banks on the inter-bank money markets. This gives the larger
banks an arbitrage in the market because of their stronger financial
position.

Under a World Bank-assisted "Action Plan", the Indonesian Government
helped the state-owned banks to increase their paid-up capitalisation
to Rp1 trillion ($455 million). Private sector banks are also in the
process of building their capital base to meet the new capital adequacy
ratio (CAR) of 8 percent. In addition, private banks with foreign
exchange licences will have to increase their capital to Rp150 billion
and CAR of 12 percent by the year 2001.

Banks in Indonesia, however, play a greater role in the country's
economic development as compared to other countries. Viewed from a
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) perspective, there are 3.6 banks to every
$10 billion GDP. Japanese banks account for only 0.56 banks to every
$10 billion GDP in that country.

While this does imply that Indonesian banks are in a better position to
benefit from the 8 percent-10 percent growth in the GDP in recent
years, the converse is also true. If there is any let up in the growth
of the country's economy, the banking industry will suffer more than
the Japanese banks are experiencing currently.

Bank Indonesia issued a directive in September 1995 that commercial
banks holding foreign-exchange licences have to increase their paid up
capital to Rp150 billion by September 2001. This is expected to cause
smaller banks to merge in order to meet the higher capitalisation
requirements.

Standard & Poor's is also concerned about the banking community's
exposure to finance companies. The number of finance companies has
proliferated in recent years. Finance companies in Indonesia operate
outside the ambit of the central bank and are disallowed from accepting
public deposits. They are funded primarily through bank borrowings. S&P
is concerned that banks lending to finance companies are indirectly
taking on finance companies loan portfolio, which is inherently much
weaker than that of the banking industry.

But Bank Indonesia has been introducing tighter supervision and a
clearer accounting framework to improve the transparency in the
industry. The only concern is that banks generally delay the release of
audited statements.

"Many commercial banks still do not disclose non-performing loans,"
said S&P in an evaluation of the Indonesian banking industry. The
agency is concerned that loans are concentrated towards affiliates and
large borrowers. There is also high exposure to office and condominium
projects. Lippo Bank experienced a crisis situation in late 1995 when
it was unable to manage its own fundings of the large property
development projects undertaken by its own affiliate property
companies.

Equities analysts, however, feel that if the government's strengthening
efforts pay off, several Indonesian banks will ride the strong economic
growth predicted for the country. Analysts predict that loans would
grow by 30 percent-40 percent last year, and that average earnings
would have grown by about 25 percent. Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia,
Panin Bank and Bank Bali have been identified as being fundamentally
strong.

However, the lack of depth in the capital market makes it difficult for
banks to meet their obligations in a timely and cost efficient manner.
S&P's assessment is that"banks bearing the brunt of problem loans are
not likely to recover, unaided, to full fiscal health for at least five
to seven years".

DBS BANK STREAMLINES FOR THE FUTURE

The Development Bank of Singapore recently restructured its top
management in a move that is expected to generate greater
accountability for product lines

THE KEY feature of the recent reorganisation move by the Development
Bank of Singapore (DBS Bank) is the stronger vertical reporting lines.

The two top positions will be taken by Ng Kee Choe and Lau Chan Sin. Ng
will be responsible for the entire institutional banking side of the
business while Lau will be in charge of individual banking, which will
include the retail and private banking businesses.

The heads of the bank's retail and private banking divisions,
respectively Elsie Foh and Tan Mong Tong, will report directly to Lau.
This is expected to give them greater leverage at the top level of the
bank's management to respond to changes more quickly.

Similarly, Ng Kee Choe will have Tan Soo Nan reporting to him on
treasury and investment management activities, and Soh Kim Soon
reporting on international and corporate banking. Oliver Tan, another
senior executive vice president, will take over special projects from
January 1, reporting directly to the chairman, Ngiam Tong Dow.

DBS Bank has been introducing new initiatives in rapid succession
lately. On the retail front, it recently extended opening hours to 5pm
from the traditional 3pm for other banks, as a result of greater
efficiencies in the branch network. This is in addition to the
authorised trading centres and investment centres it set up last year.
In investment banking, the bank achieved distinction in becoming the
region's leader in advisory and underwriting portfolios.

The bank is also already working out an expansion plan across the
region. It has obtained banking licences in Shanghai (China), Sri
Lanka, Thailand (provincial licence in Rayong) and the Philippines. The
notable exception is Malaysia, where DBS Bank is the only Big Four
Singapore bank without a full banking licence in the neighbouring
country. However, it has set up representative offices in Bombay,
Rangoon, and Labuan (an offshore centre in Malaysia).

DBS Bank is particularly active in the securities industries in most of
the regional markets, particularly Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.
DBS has a strong custodian business in its home market as well as in
Malaysia. In December, it set up a custodian joint venture in Thailand
with the Thai Danu Bank. Ng announced the bank's plan to expand its
share custodian services network to South Korea, Indonesia, the
Philippines and India.

Singapore banks have had a strong reputation of being adequately
capitalised. Although profitability has not been one of their strong
points, things have been improving in the last two years.

According to analyst reports, the combined return on equity of the Big
Four banks for the year ended 1994 was 13.3 percent, up from 9.9
percent the previous year.

As the Singapore economy matures and competition for funds becomes more
intense, banks are becoming more cognisant about shareholder value. The
capital surplus position of Singapore banks and the returns from
non-bank activities, such as investment and property holdings, also
puts them in a good position to acquire new businesses.

A DBS Bank spokesperson told Asian Banker that there is no overriding
motive in the restructuring exercise. In typical public relations
parlance, she said the move "is part of our ongoing renewal process".
The bank did not hire any consultants to advise it on the changes in
the top management line up.

This is in contrast with at least two of the other Big Four banks,
which have been using consultants quite extensively. The leading edge
retail banking initiatives in UOB Bank, such as its InvestShops, were
treated as special projects, with consultants from Andersen Consulting
reporting directly to the president.

OCBC Bank, on the other hand, appointed McKinsey & Co as consultants to
develop a new strategic focus for the organisation. One observer told
Asian Banker that as McKinsey specialises in high level strategy
issues, OCBC Bank is being forced to speak to other consultancy
companies to propose new implementation initiatives.

The overall business and organisational direction, strategies and
policies of DBS Bank will now be driven by a"Bank Business Committee".
It will be chaired by chairman Ngiam Tong Dow, with the deputy
presidents and senior executive vice presidents as members. This small
task force approach is expected to help the management to take decisive
and timely measures to respond to new challenges in the market. It will
also keep management meetings short and sweet.

BANKS PUSH ON WITH DIRECT TRADING

Malaysia's stockbroking community did not take too long to realise that
new delivery channels through PALDirect and Southern Bank Link may
threaten their very existence

TONG KOOI Ong, the 35-year-old chief executive officer of Malaysia's
Phileo Allied Group, has much in common with PALDirect, the genius
product of the group's subsidiary, AlliedBank. Both are essentially
brash, new innovations into a market that has yet to wake up to the
realisation that the brave new world has already arrived.

PALDirect was designed primarily to give stock market players direct
control over their trade. Through a dedicated terminal, the bank's
customers are able to place their trades on-line to Phileo Allied, the
bank's broking subsidiary, which then executes it.

As the entire transaction is carried out within the group, PhileoAllied
is able to give AlliedBank a rebate of 25 percent of the 1 percent
brokerage commission that was due to it under securities regulations.
The bank in turn passes on 20 percent to the customer and keeps 5
percent for itself.

Any banker looking at the arrangement would recognise the genius
involved in running a transaction through several organisations, using
technology that enables all parties to be winners - the bank adds value
to its customer services, the stockbroking company gets trade orders,
and the customer benefits from lower overall costs and greater
convenience.

But the Malaysian stockbroking community panicked. The immediate fear
was that if the system was perpetuated, brokers would lose their market
share and remisiers would have become essentially redundant. The Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), possibly acting on pressure from the
stockbroking community, issued a directive to PhileoAllied Securities
to stop passing down the commission to AlliedBank.

The KLSE based its directive on the exchange's Rule 6(7) that specifies
that rebates can be only given to approved financial institutions. The
KLSE further interpreted the rule as saying that this rebate can only
be enjoyed by the financial institution and not passed down further to
its customers.

Tong, true to form, went on the offensive. He applied for a court
ruling on the interpretation of the rule against devolving commission
to customers. The financial community was, at best, amused as nobody
had ever taken the stock exchange to court before.

The upshot of the offensive was that Tong was able to call the KLSE's
bluff. The court application was subsequently dropped after an
undisclosed out-of-court agreement and PALDirect continued unaffected.

The issue that arose out of this skirmish is of a more fundamental
interest to the financial community and deserves some thinking through.
Firstly, does PALDirect enable banks to enter the stockbrokers' trade
without a licence? Secondly, do these computers in remote locations
become de facto "branches" of stockbroking houses? This is significant
because of the restriction in many countries against stockbrokers
expanding their branch networks, particularly into remote areas.

Malaysia does have many remisiers - 5,000 licensed remisiers at the
last count a few months ago. This is almost half the number of people
working in the entire banking industry in the labour scarce country.
Remisiers come from a variety of backgrounds - from housewives to
highly-qualified professionals. All are lured by the opportunity to
make much more money in passing share certificates around than through
pursuits that could build much needed skills in other areas of the
country's development.

At the height of the stock market's bull run in the early 1990s, the
lack of Remisiers called for urgent technological innovations, although
none was forthcoming at the time. Small retail customers had to beg
remisiers to take on their trade. All this turned with the market. The
market itself became more sophisticated with unit trusts and other
long-term investment products becoming available and affordable.

Remisiers generally fear that PALDirect is setting a precedent. Already
two other Malaysian banks are said to be interested in developing
similar products. Although the stockbrokers that Asian Banker spoke to
are generally dismissive about PALDirect, there is no reason why they
too cannot go on the offensive.

Southern Bank Securities, a small stockbroking company located in the
unlikely town of Ipoh 200 kilometres north of the capital city of Kuala
Lumpur, has also recently introduced a system similar to PALDirect.
Called Southern Bank Link (SBL), the system sits on any personal
computer running the Windows operating system (as compared to
PALDirect's "dedicated" terminals).

Brokers are far from losing their jobs too soon. Both SBL and PALDirect
still require brokers as, in effect, customers actually place their
orders with them to be executed on-line to the stock exchange.
Remisiers also remain useful where contra trade is involved. In
Singapore, where retail investors can trade using automated teller
machines, transactions have to be settled immediately. This is
unfavourable as compared to trading through a broker where customers
have a settlement period of T+7 days, during which time they can deal
in contra trades.

In the case of PALDirect, the entry level for direct trade is set very
high. Customers are expected to maintain an interest-earning fixed
deposit of RM198,000 ($79,200) to have the PALDirect link-up for free.
Alternatively, they will have to pay RM6138 ($2,455) over 31 months for
the terminal and RM98 every month after that as maintenance fee. SBL
customers on the other hand pay only RM250 per month, although this
broking house does not pass on savings to the customer. These
arrangements could only interest the most liquid and active of retail
investors.

The managers of both products say they hope to attract the"middle to
high level players" on the stock market. This includes fund managers
and sophisticated investors who want greater control over their trade
positions. Although neither was willing to disclose the number of
customers they have signed up, it is believed they are each aiming at
approximately 1,000 customers within a year from their respective
launch dates.

While not all brokers and remisiers are about to lose their jobs, those
who will survive will be the ones that prove that they add greater
value than the machines that threaten their relevance.

INTERNATIONAL DEBIT MAKES ITS DEBUT

An international consumer debit payment industry is about to take off
in Asia, now that the major card organisations and terminal
manufacturers are introducing major initiatives in the region

UNTIL RECENTLY, when bank customers travelled abroad, the only
effective card-based payment channel had been the use of a credit card
- either at the ATM for cash advances or at point of sale for credit
card sales.

The two card organisations, MasterCard International and VISA
International, are currently at the forefront of major initiatives that
can see the use of international debit cards (the international version
of the domestic ATM card or the electronic funds transfer at point of
sale) take off in Asia, and around the world.

Debit cards provide consumers with an alternative to cash, cheques,
travellers cheques or even converting currencies when they travel.
Officials from both MasterCard and VISA told Asian Banker they are
convinced that international debit cards are not alternatives to credit
cards and will not cannibalise this market.

Andre Sekulic, the senior vice president of MasterCard's debit card
programme in the region, told Asian Banker that studies in the US show
that well over 60 percent of all payments made in the US are still
based on cash.

The banks benefit by being able to add value to their depositors'
lifestyle in a tangible way while earning fees on transactions. The
merchants benefit from the incremental sales generated by impulse
buying. Experts also believe that merchant receipts are higher as a
result.

John Hinds, the executive vice president of Verifone, a transaction
automation company, said the debit system is safer, and transactions
are completed on-line, which is faster than cheque and even cash
transactions where money has to be moved around.

The safety of a debit card transaction is based on the PIN-based
technology introduced by transaction automation companies such as
Verifone. Card users are required to key in their personal
identification numbers (PIN) into a "PIN-pad" before a transaction is
authorised. In most instances, the same PIN is used for ATM-related
transactions.

Market growth

It is likely that the international debit programmes of both card
organisations will depend largely on the link-ups they make with the
major domestic networks services in the region. This is also because
the major networks already have in place, or are building, domestic
debit programmes that would be severely disrupted if international
debit is introduced alongside them.

For example, the Network for Electronic Transfer (NETS) in Singapore
was concerned that non-participating banks would be able to effectively
access these networks if card holders were able to use their
international debit cards within the same country. Because of this, the
banking authorities in Singapore disallowed domestic card holders from
using their international debit cards within the country.

Henry Mundt, MasterCard's director for Global Debit Services, estimates
that by the end of 1995, there would be 750,000 terminals accepting
Maestro cards globally. Out of this number, he expects that 250,000
terminals would be operational in co-operation with networks such as
NETS.

In Taiwan, the Financial Information System Centre (FISC), which
provided the national domestic debit card network, is still
contemplating its involvement in international debit. Silvia Lee,
FISC's executive vice president, said Maestro is obviously something
which it has a keen interest in, except that right now the organisation
is concentrating on its own IC Card-based EFTPOS system.

The IC Card is a smart card-based ATM-cum-debit card which FISC
introduced in 1993. Currently, more than 400,000 of the cards have been
issued by its 19 member banks. The system has a merchant base of some
4,000.

FISC is now in direct competition with the National Credit Card Centre
(NCCC) which previously processed only credit card transactions. The
NCCC has announced that it expects to start international debit
acquiring activities in early 1996 by signing on with Maestro. NCCC
expects to build its debit programme on its existing credit card
merchant base exceeding 60,000 organisations.

The NCCC has applied to be the switching and settlement centre for all
domestic Maestro transactions. At present, Chinatrust Commercial Bank
is the only Maestro acquirer in the country. Sources said that because
of unresolved issues pertaining to interchange and switching functions,
the Ministry of Finance has restricted the other banks from acquiring
merchants. However, the NCCC and FISC have been instructed by the
Ministry of Finance to co-operate on a programme that will allow all
card transactions to be settled domestically.

The other Maestro issuing banks have understandably pushed for the
lifting of the restriction. Observers see the assignment of the
transaction processing function to NCCC as a possible solution to the
question of who should be responsible for the domestic processing of
Maestro transactions.

This will then pave the way for the other institutions to be involved
in merchant acquisition. So far there are an estimated 1,000 merchant
locations that accept the Maestro debit facility in the country. An
estimated 400,000 Maestro cards have been issued.

In China, what have been dubbed as MasterCard and VISA credit cards,
are actually at best deferred debit transactions - that is, customers
pay for their transactions from their salary accounts held with the
bank.

The controversy over the definition is not as significant as the fact
that it means China is potentially the largest debit card market in the
world. The Chinese Government, responding to a World Bank study on the
development of payment systems in the country, has been committed to
developing a nationwide cashless payment system. This commitment is
expressed in the development of the Golden Card project.

In Malaysia, MasterCard launched its Maestro/Cirrus programme through
two organisations in 1993. It hopes to issue 500,000 international
debit cards in the country by the end of 1995. MasterCard's Mundt told
Asian Banker that there are already 5,000 Maestro acceptance locations,
mostly at petrol kiosks, in Malaysia.

The banks currently issuing the Maestro/Cirrus cards are MBf Cards
Services, a non-bank issuer which pegged the card on its existing
Vision bank card, and Standard Chartered Bank.

Maestro went on-line in the Philippines as an extension of the BPI
Express Payment System debit programme. Link-ups are expected with
Jetco, the domestic point of sale debit switch provider in Hong Kong.

Cost issues

Tim Molly, a director with VISA International, said that merchants
accepting Maestro transactions will have to pay acquirers transaction
fees that are similar to fees for credit card transactions.

Mei-may Lek Bors, a debit programme director with MasterCard, told
Asian Banker that debit programmes offer profit opportunities to
acquiring institutions in the form of higher interchange fees, a new
source of merchant revenue, and the overall lower implementation cost.
For issuing members, the profit opportunities arise from interchange
fees, transaction fees and annual membership fees.

In Australia, where direct debit initiatives were driven by the
merchants in the past, it was the banks that paid the merchants to
acquire their transactions. This was called the "negative interchange
fees" and was thought to be the trend that would develop.

However, Jim Culbertson, the VISA country manager for Australia, told
Asian Banker that this situation was unique to Australia and only in
the past when the merchants originally invested in the technology. This
trend is being reversed in Australia as smaller merchants sign up with
banks that have already got the infrastructure in place. As such, it is
the merchants that now have to pay transaction fees to the acquiring
banks.

There are cost benefits also for the customer. MasterCard's Mundt told
Asian Banker in an interview that in 1995 alone, there were 330 million
credit and debit cross-border transactions around the world. Seventy
percent, or 210 million, of those transactions were for cash withdrawal
on ATMs.

Mundt also pointed out that customers would benefit from the lower
exchange rates used for debit products and save between $5 to $10 per
transaction. He is convinced that the market would welcome a cheaper
debit-based service that would enable them to access cash from their
own home accounts.

Transaction equipment manufacturers

Hypercom, which accounts for 90 percent of the credit card verification
devices market, and its competitor VeriFone, which accounted for 60
percent of all new installations exported from the US in 1994, are both
believed to be making major advances in the area of developing common
terminal acceptance for debit as well as credit and smart cards.

Other competitors in the market are Taiwanese-based ADI, France-based
Ingenico and the Australian company KeyCorp. Domestic competitors  such
as Fuzhou's Star Group are also coming on-stream.

Connecting to smart cards

All debit card players in the market have an eye towards building a
smart card capability in their overall cards strategy. Adding a chip on
a debit card is beneficial as it enhances the security of transactions,
whether they are credit or debit and can be loaded with value. These
are also called electronic purses.

There are other benefits of smart cards, such as the ability to store
relationship data with merchants and the bank. This has been
successfully exploited by major retail organisations such as
Takashimaya in Singapore which has issued up to 200,000 cards to date.

This is why transaction automation players such as Verifone are keen to
push terminals in the market that can process smart card as well as
cards with the traditional magnetic strip on them. Verifone has also
set up a joint venture marketing company with the smart card
manufacturer GemPlus, called VeriGem, to promote the move towards a
smart card-based payments system.

Which way now?

MasterCard's Mundt told Asian Banker that MasterCard will not allow
Maestro to be resident on the same card as the MasterCard credit card,
at least not in the foreseeable future. He also said that MasterCard
would not allow duality to participating institutions. This means that
issuers would not be allowed to put MasterCard's Maestro and VISA's
Interlink on the same debit card.

He is convinced that having a credit and a direct debit facility on one
card will cause confusion to users and merchants, particularly in
markets where direct debit facilities are not yet available. Mundt told
Asian Banker that MasterCard may reverse this policy if there is
worldwide availability of account select between credit and debit
transactions at merchant's EFTPOS terminals. This policy is significant
as it is different from the relationship card strategy taken by VISA,
which allows all facilities to be resident on one card.

So which way will the banks and financial institutions go in Asia?
Francois Dutray, the group executive vice president of VISA
International responsible for product development, told Asian Banker
that "we can't make the members do what they don't want to do".

Both organisations will obviously push their international debit cards
as one of the products to member associations. The cards market may
well have enough space for credit and debit products to co-exist side
by side successfully in the near future.

MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL

MEI-MAY LEK Bors, director of MasterCard's Debit Card Programme in
Southeast Asia, revealed at a Verifone seminar late last year that
1,444 institutions in 58 countries worldwide have signed up to
participate in the Maestro programme. The programme has gone live in 28
countries and 168 million cards have been issued for use on 536,271
point of sale terminals.

In the Asia Pacific region alone, 80 member institutions have signed up
for Maestro involving 29,392 million committed cards and 8,375 million
live cards. Out of 96,197 point of sale terminals which have been
committed, 25,920 have gone live. Around the region, 51,778 merchants
have committed to the programme out of which 15,552 have gone live.

According to MasterCard, there are 9 million active Maestro cards in
the Asia Pacific region and another 43.5 million cards committed. This
is supported by more than 24,000 terminals in the region and 505,000
terminals worldwide.

According to Henry Mundt, MasterCard's director for Global Debit
Services, in total there are 110 million debit cards in MasterCard's
Maestro and Cirrus programmes around the world. He expects the Asia
Pacific region to be the fastest growing for the organisation
worldwide. The region will commit approximately 16 million live cards
by the end of 1995.

VISA INTERNATIONAL

ACCORDING TO Eric Trotter a director with VISA International is a
relatively new player in the region's international debit market. VISA
Plus is its ATM access card and VISA Interlink is its debit card for
use at EFTPOS terminals.

The Interlink programme is better developed in Australia than other
countries in the region. Fifty-eight banks have signed up to the
programme in that country. In Asia itself, Singapore is the first
country in the region to introduce the VISA Interlink card.

Elsewhere, Interlink will be introduced in Korea (going live in
November), Malaysia (five members issuing), Thailand (working with Thai
Farmers' Bank and Thai Military Bank to acquire Interlink transactions,
while four out of the top six banks already issue such cards), Hong
Kong (three projects), Singapore (first full issuing and acquiring
project with UOB Bank) and Taiwan (four banks have signed up). He also
mentioned initiatives in New Zealand, Indonesia and the Philippines.

THE MASTERCARD-VERIFONE ALLIANCE PROGRAMME

IN AUGUST this year, MasterCard and Verifone announced a joint
marketing alliance to promote the acquisition of on-line debit
transaction equipment by banks for use at merchant points of sale.
Under the scheme, discounts and bonuses are given for selected Verifone
systems for deployment in targeted merchants such as fast food
restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies, petrol kiosks and other retail
outlets. The Verifone terminals being promoted are the Omni 395
Transaction Automation System, a printer roll, and/or Printer 950 and
the PINpad 1000 entry device.

The combination supports credit, debit and smart card transactions, all
on the same system. The Printer 950 also supports Japanese, Chinese and
Korean languages as well as supporting customised printing.

Verifone is also committed to provide training and support services to
support the successful take up of the new technology.

CLIENT/SERVER - THE NEW COMPUTING PARADIGM?

Asian Banker investigates the impact of client/server technology, and
highlights some of the key issues that banks should be looking at

EVERY ORGANISATION, including banks, wants to know, in measurable
terms, that the benefits derived from their investments in information
technology should exceed, if not at least equal, the costs involved.
With new technology the task of justifying such investment becomes even
harder. The task becomes even more tedious when one considers
client/server technology.

Although significant cost savings may be available in automating an
application on a client/server rather than a mainframe system, the cost
savings may not be as pronounced when comparing mid-range systems to
client/servers. Many mid-range systems are priced to compete with
larger multi-workstation LANs (local area networks), and the
development tools and the on-line security features available on
mid-range systems may be more advanced than the client/servers.
Similarly, fully-featured turnkey application software may be generally
available on a mid-range system, while client/server-based application
software may lack the functionality desired by larger financial
institutions.

Organisation-wide application systems are generally less attractive
candidates for downsizing to client/servers than department
applications. Departmental applications tend to have a limited number
of users and less sophisticated database and integration requirements
than organisation-wide systems. Consequently, these systems can be
moved to client/server architecture with less risk and less potential
negative impact on the organisation as a whole.

Moving to a client/server architecture may not be a difficult process.
Data extraction tools, file transfer tools, query languages,
downloading and uploading tools, and PC interface products all
contribute to the cultural change necessary to implement client/server
technology. The next step is providing graphical user interfaces to end
users so data can be represented in a more "user friendly" format -
with charts, graphs and other pictorial representations.

Some productivity gains may be found with client/server technology.
Mainframe development time has long been the Achilles' heel of
mainframe computing - and the most significant reason for considering
platform changes. Lengthy development time equates to high costs, unmet
expectations and dissatisfied end users. Client/server architecture
offers the advantage of quickly addressing minimum systems requirement
and providing tools that can be implemented by the end user with
limited technical support involvement.

Ideally, the use of client/server technology will help an organisation
better utilise the equipment already in place. Most organisations have
significant investments in personal computer-based systems, which are
often used for"resource sharing" - that is, local area networks set up
to share hardware resources, which may be under-utilised in the
client/server context.

Client/server architecture provides the capability for the front-end
portion of major application to be processed on a LAN, while the
back-end portion of the application can reside on the mainframe system.
Each system should be dependent on the other for the transfer and
communication of timely information, and together they should form the
entire application system.

US-based IT magazine Computerworld recently cited a survey by Sentry
Market Research, which found 70 percent of IT shops predicting that
client/server will ultimately be their primary computing model. In
Asia, although no similar survey has been carried out, industry
watchers believe that within the next two to five years, large Asian
banks will start to deploy client/servers in the more mission critical
and higher volume back-office applications.

While most client/server implementations have occurred in selected
applications, organisations are now focused on moving mission critical,
strategic applications towards client/server technology.

As the market moves towards the new paradigm, there are many lessons to
be learned from earlier experiences with the technology. Earlier
implementators of client/server technology found that the costs
involved far exceeded what was budgeted, especially labour, networking
and training bills. Worse, the expected benefits were hard to measure
and quantify. Productivity and improved customer service were
attributes which were simply impossible to be put on the balance sheet
and analyse.

One of the prime movers behind client/servers technology has been the
business unit managers who have profit and loss responsibilities.
Tasked and under pressure to realise ever increasing revenues and
income targets, these managers see client/server as the technological
enabler that will bring about faster and more prolific product
development, improved customer service and decreased costs.

Client/server may or may not provide the tool that is needed to achieve
these goals. However, the question can only be ultimately answered when
systems are fully deployed.

The implementation of client/server systems may improve productivity of
the organisation's non-technical resources as well as technical
resources. Client/server systems should provide tools for the end user
for data extraction, reporting and graphical interfaces. In some cases,
both technical and non-technical personnel will have access to CASE
(computer-aided software engineering) tools for developing and
enhancing client/server applications.

Although mainframe processing work load can be reduced through
client/server technology, this is not the area of greatest benefit to
the organisation. Data integrity may be improved by providing an
environment where information is created and maintained closer to the
user department responsible for information ownership. Through good
application controls, this information in detailed form can be
available to many user departments, but controlled through security
practices and procedures. Duplicate information and dispersed
information, which may lack consistency and accuracy, could be
minimised with proper design of the application.

While client/server architecture offers some significant benefits to
the organisation, it also can have disadvantages. Application
maintenance when dealing with several platforms, data structure and
programming languages could increase the complexity of the change.
Consequently, CASE tools that embrace departmental and host processing
requirements are important to minimise ongoing support and maintenance
of client/server systems. In addition, the lack of standards for
client/server technology may reduce the consistency of applications.

Ultimately, the lack of standards impacts the speed of modification and
implementation when application requirements need to change. Some de
facto standards already exist in the industry, such as the UNIX or
Novell operating systems for server operating software and SQL
(structured query language) for interfacing and accessing various
database systems. However, more specific standards may be needed for
the organisation to ensure proper control over the development and
implementation process. This can be achieved through a standards
committee, which would be responsible for identifying standards for the
organisation.

SOVEREIGN RISK: BANK DEPOSITS V. BONDS

Moody's explains why it maintains foreign currency bank deposit
ceilings that are distinct from foreign currency sovereign ceilings

IN OUR view, the two ratings (a foreign currency bank deposit rating
and a foreign currency sovereignity rating) are needed to reflect
inherent differences in the credit risks of bank deposits versus bonds.

As sovereign ceilings, both types of ratings are intended to account
for foreign currency transfer risk - the risk that no matter how
creditworthy a given borrower domiciled in the nation may be, that
borrower always remains subject to transfer risks.

On the basis of both empirical evidence and analytical considerations,
we believe that foreign currency transfer risk applies somewhat
differently to bonds and notes than it does to foreign currency bank
deposits, especially as we move down the ratings scale.

Specifically, a review of worldwide sovereign default experience since
World War II shows that when sovereign nations have defaulted on any of
their foreign currency obligations (in our concept of default we
include missed or delayed disbursement of interest and/or principal,
and/or obligatory credit maintenance arrangements), they have been more
likely to default on bank deposits and commercial loans than on
sovereign bonds or notes.

Put differently, when sovereigns have come under sufficient financial
stress to default on foreign commercial loans, if they have had any
significant amount of foreign currency bank deposits, they have usually
also defaulted on these deposits -but not necessarily on their
sovereign bonds.

In fact, we have concluded that the overall risk that a particular
country will "reschedule" foreign currency deposits comes very close to
equalling the overall risk that country will becoming involved in any
type of foreign currency debt rescheduling. The risk of a bond default
has been significantly lower.

There are several key reasons for this. For one, the consequences of
defaulting on (ie. rescheduling) bank deposits or loans has been more
predictable and potentially far less detrimental to a nation's
interests than defaulting on bonds and notes. In addition, it is clear
in international law that a foreign currency bank deposit is generally
within the purview of the country where it is located. Thus, a
government that forces a rescheduling of foreign currency bank deposits
through changes in its foreign exchange policy is unlikely to face a
successful legal challenge to its action from depositors.

By contrast, given the erosion of the older concept of sovereign
immunity since World War II, the legal immunity of sovereign who
defaults on foreign currency bonds has become considerably more
problematical than it once was.

Increasingly, defaulting sovereigns will face determined legal
challenges from bond-holders armed and encouraged by such developments
as the 1992 US Supreme Court case of Argentina v. Weltover, which
sanctioned an action brought against a sovereign borrower in a US
Court, Great Britain's State Immunity Act of 1978, which limited claims
of sovereign immunity, and the European Convention on Sovereign
Immunity which has also codified limits to claims of sovereign
immunity.

Given this risk differential, we are likely to maintain foreign
currency bank deposit ceilings that are in some cases lower than our
ratings for sovereign bonds and notes, While these ratings will tend in
practice to be identical in the case of countries characterised by high
credit quality - due to small differences in the two risks for
countries at the higher end of the ratings scale - they may diverge in
the case of countries in the lower investment grade or below investment
grade range.

The conceptual framework

In order to establish foreign currency bank deposit ceilings that are
distinct from currency sovereign ceilings, several preliminary tasks
are required, including: 1) an examination of what distinguishes
sovereign borrowers from other borrowers; 2) an empirical analysis of
sovereign default experience; and 3) an examination of implications of
the changing legal and economic framework for sovereign borrowing.

As indicated in this report, the legal framework surrounding sovereign
default has evolved considerably since 1945.

In the prewar period, countries enjoyed near-total immunity from
lawsuits. That is no longer true in the US, the UK, or throughout most
of Europe.

A good way to start a technical discussion is to lay out first
principles. By now, although most investors have become comfortable
with the concept of foreign currency sovereign ceiling, it is still
always worth defining our terms to avoid any misunderstanding.

What is sovereignty?

The first thing we should ask ourselves here is what is meant by
"sovereign"? According to Webster's dictionary, the possession of
sovereignty means having "supreme power, especially over a body politic
what distinguishes sovereign borrowers from all other creditors.

The self-image of sovereign states, and the way that sovereign states
view each other, have changed in many important ways over the
centuries. During various periods in history, sovereignty has lain with
villages, towns, cities and tribes. At some points sovereignty became
associated with entire empires. In the modern period, sovereignty has
become a property almost exclusively of the nation state, a relatively
recent political development. Since nation states did not appear
spontaneously, but rather emerged over time, it should not be
surprising that the nature of nation-state sovereignty has evolved and
mutated as circumstances have changed.

Freedom from a higher authority is clearly an important characteristic
of sovereignty. However, as we know from history, powerful states have
often influenced events in weaker ones through military, economic,
and/or diplomatic means.

What appears to be relevant since 1945 is that military intervention by
one state against another is no longer considered to be an acceptable
modus operandi, except for the gravest of reasons. Prior to 1945,
nations often used military force for all sorts of reasons: colonial
ambitions, ideology, territorial expansion, etc. In some cases,
countries resorted to military intervention to insure repayment of
foreign debts.

To realise how international convention has changed, one need only
consider that in today's world no one would ever propose military
intervention to deal with a sovereign state that was unable to meet its
foreign currency obligations on a timely basis, in contrast to the 19th
and early 20th centuries, when such measures were resorted to on
several occasions.

In recent decades we have seen the development of a greater respect for
national sovereignty. For instance, international boundaries are now
generally considered inviolate, as is a government's right to
non-interference in its domestic political affairs - except perhaps
when basic human rights are grossly threatened. Ironically, at the same
time, increased international co-operation has in practice tended to
reduce actual expressions of sovereignty.

Economic co-operation, economic integration, economic interdependence
all are creating a situation in which new limitations upon sovereignty
are evolving. A perfect example of this development is the development
is the changing relationship between commercial law and sovereign
states.

Any credit analysis must take into account not only a debtor's ability
- but also its willingness - to repay. Determining a country's ability
to repay is in the end not very difficult task. In all but the most
extreme cases, countries have the ability to repay their debts.

This may appear surprising to anyone who lived through the debit crisis
of the 1980s, let alone the economic devastation of 1930s. But in fact,
no matter what their economic status, countries usually have the
resources needed to repay their debts. However, as John Moody pointed
in 1933, when discussing depression-era sovereign defaults, "Many
[sovereigns] were confronted with the choice between suspension of debt
services or almost complete elimination of imports." As he noted,
import reduction could only be taken so far. If imports declined beyond
a certain point, governments faced the possibility of political
unrest.[1] The real question is - what level of resource mobilisation
are governments willing to undertake in order to repay their debts? In
the end, willingness to repay is the key to sovereign credit analysis.
And here we do not mean merely the desire to repay, but rather the
desire coupled with willingness to bear the consequences of repayment.

Governments may not like the economic and/or political consequences of
policies which would enable them to meet payments on their debts. There
is often a kind of conventional wisdom regarding the degree of
sacrifice which should be required in order for a sovereign to remain
current. In the final analysis, the nature of the "willingness issue"
is what distinguishes commercial from sovereign borrowers.

If a commercial borrower lacks willingness, legal sanctions up to and
including asset seizure and liquidation are available to creditors.
However, in cases where sovereign borrowers refused to pay - or as is
more likely the case, refuse to repay according to original terms -
they are immune from most of the legal sanctions available to creditors
vis-a-vis non-sovereign borrowers. Obviously, sovereign borrowers
cannot be forced into bankruptcy.

Until recently, foreign sovereign borrowers could not even be brought
into court in the world's major financial centres. Even now, attaching
sovereign assets is seldom seen as a viable option. Fortunately for
creditors, however, other less drastic sanctions, which will be
discussed below, appear to preclude frivolous sovereign defaults.

More importantly, there are many incentives for sovereigns to maintain
their creditworthiness. For instance, a creditworthy sovereign borrower
has much lower borrowing costs than one which has a poor credit
history. Economic conditions which contribute to sovereign
creditworthiness are also often associated with more rapid economic
growth. The more rapid the rise in income, generally the happier is a
national body politic. Unless subject to considerable stress, sovereign
borrowers clearly would prefer to meet their financial obligations on a
timely basis.

Sovereign ceilings

Sovereign ceilings for bonds and notes represent the highest foreign
currency rating an issuer might have where the obligor is subject to
the sovereignty of a particular government. Such ratings are based upon
the default risk for medium and/or long-term debt obligations issued by
a national government (denominated in a foreign currency), either in
its own name or with a guarantee. Put differently, it represents the
"foreign currency transfer risk" associated with investing in a
particular country.

In cases where there is no particular debt obligation outstanding, a
sovereign ceiling rating could still be issued based on an assessment
of risk posed by a national government if it were to issue a foreign
currency obligation.

We consider such obligations to represent the lowest foreign currency
default risk within a country. The reason: a national government,
through its ability to mobilise foreign currency assets within its own
domain, has almost by definition the best ability to obtain foreign
exchange of any issuer within the country. For instance, governments
may, and often have, imposed foreign exchange controls. Governments
may, and often have, instituted foreign currency deposit regulations
aimed at capturing foreign exchange within the country. The tools
available to a government to gain access to foreign exchange are well
established and clearly recognised under international law.

Private issuers often have argued that their obligations posed a lower
risk than those of their own government in this regard because of their
special circumstances. Although we always explore each case on an
individual basis, in the end, if the issuer is subject to the law of
its home government, even if its activities are mainly undertaken
outside the home country, we have found that the issuer is in fact
still subject to the foreign currency sovereign ceiling. The foreign
currency sovereign ceiling does not necessarily represent the risk of
the establishment of exchange controls.

Nor does it necessarily represent the risk of rescheduling bank loans.
Rather, it represents simply the assessment of default risk on medium
and long-term debt foreign currency marketable debt obligations of
national governments, which in our view carry, in almost all
circumstances, the lowest foreign currency default risk in that
particular country.

Sovereign ceilings for foreign currency bank deposits represent the
default risk of: 1) foreign currency- denominated bank deposits held
within a country; 2) deposits with a branch of a foreign bank located
in the particular country; 3) deposits with a foreign branch of a bank
domiciled in that country. A foreign currency bank deposit in any
foreign-currency-denominated deposit (eg. in Mexico, any deposit
denominated in any currency except the peso) in any domestic bank or
foreign bank branch located in the country. (A foreign currency deposit
held with Citibank's Mexico City branch office would be subject to the
Mexican foreign currency bank deposit ceiling.)

It also includes any foreign-currency denominated deposits in foreign
branches of the country's banks. A Japanese yen deposit in the New York
branch of a Mexican bank would be subject to default risk posed either
by US or Mexican government.

But since the bank is subject to the laws of its home country, in this
case Mexican, any legal actions taken by the Mexican government may
have an impact upon the bank's ability to meet its foreign currency
obligations anywhere in the world, despite the deposit being located in
the US. Therefore, the Mexico foreign currency bank deposit ceiling
would apply, despite the deposit's US location.

Looked at from a different angle, since the Mexican bank's foreign
currency deposit rating is limited by the Mexican sovereign ceiling for
the bank deposits, the ratings on deposits by Mexican financial
institutions anywhere in the world are limited by the rating of foreign
currency deposits of the bank in its home country.

A default on a foreign currency bank deposit would be judged to occur
if the government mandated credit maintenance facilities, which means
that if any depositor withdraws a deposit, the depositor must
immediately redeposit/relend the same amount as was withdrawn (eg. a
requirement whereby a maturing certificate or CD must be replaced by
the purchase of new CD or provide other credit equal to the amount of
maturing CD).

What do we mean by "default"?

Moody's defines default as any missed or delayed disbursement of
interest and/or principal. We include as defaults distressed exchanges
where: (1) the issuer offers bondholders of depositors a new security
of package of securities the amount to a diminished financial
obligation (such as preferred or common stock, debt with a lower coupon
or par amount, or less liquid deposit either because of a change in
maturity or currency of denomination, or required credit maintenance
facilities) and (2) the exchange has the apparent purpose of helping
the borrower avoid default.

Moody's also classifies as a default when an issuer delays payment even
when payment is ultimately made within the grace period provided for in
an indenture or deposit agreement. Our rationale for including grace
period defaults is simply that a contractual payment was not made when
due.

It is important to keep this definition in mind, because many
commentators use"default" in a much narrower sense, that is, in the
legal context of creditor actually declaring a debtor in default on a
particular obligation, resulting in a judgment by a court in favour of
the creditor.

Anyone who examines the post-World War II period will quickly recognise
the significant practical difference between what we mean by default
and what a judge might determine to be a default in a legal proceeding.
This analysis will provide some explanations of why creditors, in
recent year, have not declared sovereign debtors in default, even when
these same sovereigns would have been considered in default using our
criteria.

Empirical evidence

Since the debt crisis of the 1980s, there has been a tremendous
resurgence of interest in pre-World War II sovereign defaults. This is
certainly understandable, for analysing the past is always useful in
providing insights into possible future developments. Now that we have
once again entered a period where sovereign borrowers - in particular
most of the world's significant developing countries - have returned to
international bond markets in a big way, many observers see the threat
of a repeat of the sovereign defaults of the 1930s as an object lesson
for what might lie ahead for creditors.

Others see the experience of the 1980s, where sovereign defaults on
bonds or other publicly traded securities were relatively rare, as a
clear indication that such sovereign securities are now substantially
immune from default risk. When we examine the history of both the
prewar period and the debt crisis of the 1980s in the light of the
structural changes which have occurred in the financial and legal
framework of international capital markets since 1945, a much more
complex picture emerges. (Editor's Note: Due to space constraint, we
are unable to publish the full and interesting examination of the
history of defaults, but subscribers may request for a full version of
this comment.)

Although in 1980 official creditors still supplied a greater amount of
credit than commercial banks or bond markets did, the marginal increase
in lending in the decade was dramatically higher for commercial banks -
from about 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 40 percent in 1980 - than
for official creditors. The increase in the relative importance of
bonds as a source of funds for the LDC's was modest.

The Debt Crisis

Mexico's debt moratorium began a period where defaulting on sovereign
debt to commercial creditors became a rather commonplace occurrence
both in the developing world and among the socialist or former
socialist countries, with over the years, several hundred billion
dollars worth of credits falling into default.

This was due to a combination of economic pressures, including a
disinflationary commodity price environment, credit quality problems
emerging in the domestic markets of the major creditor nations (eg. the
savings and load industry's restructuring due to a changing interest
rate and regulatory environment in the US), and the emergence of
economic bottlenecks in the more advanced socialist economies. All
told, approximately 50 countries have defaulted on their sovereign and
commercial obligations since August 1982 (vs. 27 countries from 1960 to
1982). Many of these countries have had to reschedule more than once.
During this time period, we have also seen reschedulings of previously
rescheduled debt. A number of countries have had a portion of their
debt forgiven by commercial creditors in recent year. A similar pattern
emerges when examining official credits.

One category of debt which seemed, according to many, to have escaped
default during the crisis of the 1980s was bonds or other marketable
security debt. Unfortunately, on closer examination, this does not
prove to be the case - at least not to the degree generally believed.
Beyond the Costa Rican, Polish, and Rhodesian (Zimbabwe) defaults,
which predate August 1982, after a careful search into the records, we
have found that six additional countries defaulted on foreign currency,
marketable securities debt.

Changes in the Legal Framework since WWII

While changes have been occurring in the structure of world financial
markets, other important changes have also been taking place which
impact the whole question of sovereign risk. One of the most important
changes has been the growth of restrictions on appeals to sovereign
immunity.

This development, on the surface, seems counterintuitive, especially
during a period when nation-states have increasingly tried to respect
the right of other nation-states. The reasons are quite
straightforward.

If sovereign immunity were absolute, then any contract with a company
wholly-owned by a foreign government would be unenforceable in a court.
This was not only the disadvantage of the non-sovereign participant to
a contract, but also would put publicly-owned companies at a
disadvantage in international trade. The risk of entering into
contracts with them would be too great in many instances.

Therefore, it was to the advantage of both sovereign-owned firms and
non-sovereign firms for sovereign-owned companies not to be considered
fully protected by appeals to sovereign immunity So for the first time,
sovereign states had a vested interest in seeing their own sovereign
immunity curtailed in order that their newly acquired
commercial/industrial activities might prosper.

As time passed, more and more activities were felt to be outside the
traditional sovereign immunity sphere. Although these developments
began to emerge gradually through individual legal decisions, some of
these changes became codified in the US in the Sovereign Immunities Act
of 1976, and in the UK in the State Immunity Act of 1978, and by
international agreement in the European Convention on State Immunity.

Despite these relatively recent attempts to codify sovereign immunity
questions, major points of contention still remain, resulting, as one
would expect in this increasingly litigious world, in various lawsuits,
some of which helped illuminate certain aspects of the remaining
problems.

Default Experience, 1960-1982

Although most observers would not characterise this period as
particularly turbulent in terms of sovereign defaults, on careful
examination one finds more defaults than conventional wisdom would
seem to indicate.

Debt to official creditors:  During this period, at least 22
countries defaulted on debt to official creditors. (As pointed out
earlier our definition of default includes reschedulings.)

Countries Which Defaulted On Official Creditor Debt,
1960-August 1982

Argentina
Pakistan
Brazil
Peru
Central African Republic
Poland
Chile
Romania
Gabon
Senegal
Ghana
Sierra Leone
India
Sudan
Indonesia
Togo
Liberia
Turkey
Madagascar
Uganda
Nicaragua
Zaire

Commercial Bank Debt: During this same time period, at least 17
countries defaulted on debt owed to commercial banks. There is no
evidence that any of these other countries were ever legally
declared "in default" by a court of law, with one exception. In 1979
a major New York bank declared Iran in default and succeeded in
setting off deposits against the unpaid loan.[13] This default
occurred as a result of sanctions being placed against Iran. The
issue was later settled by negotiation.

Countries Which Defaulted On Foreign Currency Marketable Securities
1970-1990

Argentina
Costa Rica
Guatemala
Nigeria
Panama
Poland
Rhodesia (Zimbabwe)
Uruguay
Yugoslavia

Argentina defaulted on bonds (bonods). Guatemala restructured its
stabilisation bond debt. Nigeria defaulted on government-guaranteed
promissory notes. Panama defaulted on both bonds and floating rate
notes. Uruguay defaulted on bearer treasury bonds. Yugoslavia
defaulted on short-term bonds. Therefore, although it is clear that
since the 1970s, at least, marketable security debt has defaulted
less the risk of default of sovereign marketable security debt is
negligible.

Countries Which Defaulted On Commercial Bank Debt 1960-August 1982

Argentina
Poland*
Bolivia
Rhodesia*
Costa Rica*
Romania
Iran
Senegal
Liberia
Sudan
Madagascar
Togo
Nicaragua
Turkey
Peru
Zaire
Philippines

* Also defaulted on bonds or notes.

Bonds and Notes: It was much rarer for governments to default on
foreign-currency-denominated bonds or notes between 1960 and August
1982. But it did happen. Specifically, Costa Rica, Poland and
Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) all defaulted on international bonds
and/or notes. We have found no evidence that either Costa Rica or
Poland were legally declared in default on marketable securities
although it has been reported that creditors did go to court in
Switzerland to try to remedy a default by Bank Handlowy (Poland's
official foreign trade bank).[14] It is not clear from our search of
the published records whether there was ever a formal default
judgment made against Rhodesia. Rhodesia's default is easily
explained by the civil war and the burden of international
sanctions. Costa Rica and Poland's defaults were related to economic
/political developments within both countries. Altogether, then,
from 1960 to 1982, at least 22 countries defaulted/rescheduled
against official creditors, 17 countries against commercial banks,
with just three defaulting on marketable securities. However, the
aggregate amount of credit involved, however, although difficult to
measure from public sources, was nonetheless small enough so that
the international financial system was in no way threatened by any
of these defaults/reschedulings. But once Mexico announced its
payments moratorium in August 1982, sovereign credits entered a new
phase.

HANA BANK COMPLETES ISSUE OF FLOATING RATE NOTES

Hana Bank completed an issue of $50 million floating rate notes (FRNs).
The interest margin of Hana Bank's borrowing dropped from a 46 basis
point in 1994 to a 42 basis point in 1995 over the six-month London
interbank offered rate. The cost of funding for some Korean banks
soared from 39 to 45 basis points, resulting in some banks scrapping
their fund raising plans. The rise of the loan rates was due to
the"Japanese premium". Hana Bank will use $30 million for domestic
lending and the rest for offshore offices in Southeast Asia.

CITYTRUST SHARE OFFER

Ayala Corp, including the bank of the Philippine Islands, will join
Madrigal Group for the exercise of the latter's rights over Citytrust
Banking shares. Citytrust shares held by Citibank Overseas Investment
and Philex Mining have been offered for sale. The exact number of
shares up for sale had not been disclosed by the time Asian Banker went
to press. Citibank currently has a 47 percent stake in Citytrust and
Philex holds 17 percent. Only partial sales will be up for sale as both
parties will keep enough shares to maintain at least one board seat
each in the ten-person Citytrust board. Madrigal Group has the upper
edge because it already has a 16 percent stake in Citytrust, making it
the third-largest shareholder after Citibank and Philex. Ayala wants to
have an equal footing eventually with Madrigal in Citytrust.

TAIWAN'S BIG THREE GOVERNMENT BANKS ANNOUNCE LOWER PROFITS

Taiwan's Big Three government banks announced lower July-November
pre-tax profits for 1995 amid an overall slowdown in Taiwan's financial
industry. First Commercial Bank's pre-tax profit declined by 14 percent
to T$2.80 billion ($102.6 million) from T$3.24 billion a year earlier.
Hua Nan Commercial Bank's pre-tax profit sagged 22 percent to T$2.65
billion from T$3.4 billion. Chang Commercial Bank reported a 4.7
percent decline to T$2.42 billion from T$2.54 billion. The Taiwan
Provincial Government plans to privatise the Big Three banks by early
1997. Currently, the government owns 71.35 percent of First Bank
shares, 57.83 percent of Hua Nan Bank and 53.01 percent of Chang
Commercial Bank. Taiwan's 59 offshore banking units, or OBUs, jumped
20.2 percent to a record $34.599 billion at the end of October 1995
from a year earlier.
