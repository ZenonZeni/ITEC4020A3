<H2> EXCLUSIVELY FOR WOMEN </H2>

<P>  From the dawn of our existence, man has continued on many quests--the quest for fire, magic potions and others. No quest has been so consistent throughout recorded history as our search for ways to stimulate sexual desire and to intensify sexual satisfaction.  TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops was developed exclusively for women and contains a synergistic blend of herbal extracts from the Amazon Rainforest. These plants have been used for centuries by the indigenous people of the rainforest.</P>
<P>   Stimulating female sexual desire is much more complex than stimulating male sex drive because a woman's focus and mental state plays a much larger role. The ability to relax, unwind and shut out the stress of the day in order to focus more fully on the sexual experience is just as important as increasing desire.  For this reason, several RAINFORCE botanicals are included in the TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops, which have a documented history of use in enhancing mental acuity and focus, reducing stress, increasing focus, and acting as a general tonic and relaxant to provide these types of benefits.</P>
 <P>  Hormonal imbalances, cycles and fluctuations can cause nervousness, stress, irritability, mood swings and even depression in many women. Balancing these many hormones is a key factor in supporting a woman's natural sexual drive. Botanicals well known for their hormonal balancing ability specifically for women play another key role in this formula so that women and their partners are not at the mercy of these cyclical patterns or  problems.  With these two important areas addressed, rainforest herbs used by the indigenous tribes to increase sexual desire, enhance skin sensations and act as sexual stimulants are contained in TOUCHFIRE HERS to provide synergistic and overall effectiveness.</P>

<H2>LONG HISTORY OF DYNAMIC EFFECTS </H2>
<P>Chuchuhuasi and Catuaba are the best known and most famous sexual stimulants of many tribes throughout the Peruvian Rainforest. Their sexual stimulating and tonic effects are legendary in this regard. Maca is cultivated high in the Andes Mountains in Peru where it has been utilized for centuries to increase sexual desire and fertility, increase stamina and endurance and promote mental clarity. Damiana with its ancient reputation as a sexual stimulant also acts as an antidepressant and tonic to both the central nervous and hormonal systems. Suma, called "Brazilian Ginseng" has been used for centuries to combat fatigue and balance female hormones in cases of frigidity and impotency. Sarsaparilla has a worldwide reputation and history dating back to the 1600's as a reliable, sexual stimulant. In addition, Abuta is known throughout Amazonia as a "midwives herb," employed specifically for women as a uterine tonic and relaxant as well as to increase sexual desire.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  The rainforest plants in TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops contain vital phytochemicals and phytosterols, which nutritionally support the entire female sexual system, hormonal system, as well as the nervous system.  The indigenous people of the Amazon and rainforest regions have used these specific botanicals for centuries, not only as female tonics and sexual enhancers, but as tribal medicine to fight reduced fertility and hormonal imbalances, including menopause.  Some have even been used in marriage and fertility ceremonies for decades.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforests of the world. TOUCHFIRE HERS, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets supporting the health of women by helping to increase their sexual desire as well as helping to naturally and nutritionally balance hormone levels.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  All  botanicals  in  TOUCHFIRE  HERS  have  been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like the herbs found in TOUCHFIRE HERS and all Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE TOUCHFIRE HERS</H2>
<P>  TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops is furnished with a dropper. One dropperful contains approximately 30 drops. For best results, place 30 to 40 drops in two to three ounces of water or juice and take on an empty stomach.  Used as an occasional aid to increase female sexual desire, take 30 to 40 drops one or two hours before intimate activity.</P>
<P>  Most women take TOUCHFIRE HERS Drops on more of a routine basis. If you have special needs due to stress or lack of sex drive, take 30-40 drops twice a day for a minimum of 30 days for maximum benefit. Many women continue with this twice-a-day dosage on an ongoing basis.  However, you may try taking TOUCHFIRE HERS once a day after the initial month.   Each woman must adjust according to her needs. TOUCHFIRE HERS contains alcohol, which must be used for extracting and preserving the active phytochemicals found in the rainforest herbs contained in TOUCHFIRE HERS.  If you are sensitive to alcohol, place the recommended dosage in 2 to 3 ounces of hot or near-boiling water and let cool to lukewarm before taking; the alcohol will quickly evaporate.</P>
