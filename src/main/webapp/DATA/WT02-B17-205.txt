<UL><LI>The DOE Superconductivity Program for Electric Systems is 
planning to 
develop a World Wide Web page for the superconductivity program by the 
summer 
of 1996.  If you have any suggestions for content, contact Craig 
Matzdorf at 
410-290-0370.
<P>
<LI>LANL is currently constructing a calorimeter for measuring ac losses 
in a 
one-meter-long cable as a part of the SPI transmission line project in 
collaboration with EPRI/ASC/Pirelli/ ORNL.
<P>
<LI>Two superconductivity educational kits, a junior high/middle school 
version 
and a senior high version, are now available through DOE's Energy 
Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse. Both kits include a teacher's guide 
and a 
12-minute videotape, "An Introduction to Superconductivity."  To receive 
one of 
these kits free of charge, call the Clearinghouse at 800-363-3732 or 
send 
e-mail to energyinfo@delphi.com and request the kit version of your 
choice.
<P>
<LI>A new book, "Stability of Superconductors," written by ORNL retiree 
Larry 
Dresner is now available from Plenum Press (ISBN 0-306-45030-5). 
<P>
<LI>Abstracts for this summer's Applied Superconductivity Conference 
(August 
25-30,   Pittsburgh) are due February 1, 1996. For more information, 
contact 
Bob Hawsey of ORNL, 423-574-8057.
<P>
<LI>Oak Ridge has a new area code--423. Please change phone and fax 
listings for 
your colleagues at ORNL. The old area code will not work beginning in 
February.
