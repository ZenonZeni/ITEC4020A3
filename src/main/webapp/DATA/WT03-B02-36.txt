INSURERS SUE TO BLOCK PROPOSITION 103 IMPLEMENTATION IN CALIFORNIA

Insurance companies filed suit this week to block implementation of
California Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie's emergency
regulations to implement Proposition 103.

The action by State Farm and Allstate marked yet another twist in the
tortuous journey to implementation of the initiative passed by voters
in November 1988.

It took more than a year for Gillespie to issue the regulations, and
in the interim she was criticized by advocates of the initiative for
delay and siding with the industry. Now the initiative's backers
accept Gillespie's rules but insurers don't.

"I view this whole thing as large insurance companies showing
themselves to the door of the California market, because they're just
infuriating the public," said Harvey Rosenfield, head of Voter Revolt
and principal sponsor of Proposition 103.

He said Jan. 5 that he hadn't seen Allstate's suit, but State Farm's
litigation is "basically a joke" that wouldn't pass scrutiny by a
first-year law student.

"This simply is another way to stall and delay," he said.

State Farm Insurance filed two suits Jan. 3, challenging not only
Gillespie's new regulations to implement Proposition 103, effective
in March, but also her decision to deny an increase in auto rates
under the state's assigned risk plan.

In a suit filed in San Francisco Superior Court, the company said the
"emergency regulations" issued last month were illegal because they
don't fairly implement the auto rate provisions of Proposition 103,
passed by voters in November 1988.

State Farm said Proposition 103 forbids rates that are inadequate,
excessive or unfairly discriminatory. But it said Gillespie's rules
would bring rates that are inadequate in some cases, excessive in
others and thus are unfairly discriminatory.

Allstate Insurance Co. filed suit Jan. 4, alleging that Gillespie's
regulations violate the state constitution and weren't supported by
substantial evidence.

It said the regulations would cost the company a 25 percent drop in
revenues and a $175 million loss during the next policy year.

The suit asks Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel to
bar enforcement of the regulations and order a return to the previous
system of setting rates.

"We're asking for a return to a cost-based system," said Michael
Carlson, an attorney for Allstate.

As in other states, insurers have based rates on motorists' place of
residence, age, gender and marital status. Gillespie's regulations
would forbid use of all those, although insurers could use other
factors that would approximate the same effect.

State Farm's second suit over the California Automobile Assigned Risk
Plan, or CAARP, was filed with Judge Vogel of Los Angeles, who
already has ruled that Allstate can raise its rates by 40 percent for
bad drivers covered under CAARP.

State Farm said it has experienced an underwriting loss of $3.5
million a week from assigned-risk coverage.

California law requires motorists to carry minimum liability coverage
and requires insurers to offer assigned-risk coverage based on their
share of the market.

But if it can't get a rate increase, State Farm is asking the right
to stop issuing the coverage.

In another development, consumer advocates and representatives of
minority groups held a news conference Jan. 3 to urge California Gov.
George Deukmejian and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to approve a bill
offering motorists a no-frills, no-fault auto insurance policy.

"Consumers today are far worse off for auto insurance than they were
a year and a half ago," said Judith Bell of Consumers Union.

"We've watched the insurance companies figure out how they can scam
those hearings" held by the Insurance Department on implementing
Proposition 103.

The plan by Democratic Assemblyman Pat Johnston would allow victims
of auto accidents to sue only in case of serious injury. Otherwise
they would recover medical costs and lost wages up to $15,000 from
their own insurance companies.

Doctors would be held to the fee schedule set forth in the state's
workers' compensation plan.

Motorists covered by the minimum policy would have to go to small-
claims court to recover costs of property damage.

Minimum coverage under the bill would cost $180 a year. If property
damage were covered, Bell said, rates would rise to about $300 or
$400 a year.

It is supported by many, but not all, insurance companies --notable
exceptions being State Farm and Farmers.

It also is backed by some consumer advocates but opposed by those
associated with Ralph Nader, as well as by the California Trial
Lawyers Association. They say no-fault diminishes victims' rights.

Johnston, chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee,
left his bill in committee in last year's session when he saw he
didn't have enough votes to enact it in preference to a substitute
bill offered by the Democratic speaker.

The Legislature passed Brown's bill over the vigorous opposition of
insurers, but the Republican governor vetoed it. Deukmejian said at
the time that he was willing to work with legislators to come up with
a compromise bill.

Consumers Union's Bell said Johnston's plan failed last year "due to
an extraordinary effort by the speaker and a lack of leadership by
the governor."

INSURERS JOIN TO OPEN AN ALL-INDUSTRY "HELPLINE" FOR CONSUMERS

The life, health and property/casualty insurance industries have
joined in an unprecedented effort to establish a toll-free telephone
line to provide consumers with information.

Main sponsoring organizations for the "National Insurance Consumer
Helpline" are the American Council of Life Insurance, the Health
Insurance Association of America and the Insurance Information
Institute, which represents property/casualty companies.

Staff based in Annapolis, Md., will be expected to handle a wide
range of quesitons, refer complaints to appropriate sources and send
brochures and educational materials upon request.

Such an effort has been discussed for years, but it gained impetus
from widespread consumer dissatisfaction with the industry.

The Helpline will operate from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time
Monday through Friday, starting Jan. 2. The telephone number is 800-
942-4242.

EVEN BEST LONG-TERM CARE POLICIES INADEQUATE, A.A.R.P. REPORTS

Even some of the best long-term care insurance policies fail to
provide adequate protection against costs of nursing home care,
according to a study released Jan. 3 by the American Association of
Retired People (AARP).

The study analyzed policies offered by 11 leading companies and
concluded many "failed to achieve the basic purpose for which they
were bought."

"Many of them failed to provide much protection against the
uncertainty of paying high out-of-pocket costs for nursing home
care," the study said.

It said there were wide variations and coverage options among the
policies, leaving "a great deal of uncertainty" over how many nursing
home costs would be covered.

Applying both strict and lenient interpretations, policies might
reduce out-of-pocket spending on nursing homes by anywhere between
12.1 to 62.6 percent, the report said.

The study was conducted by Thomas Rice and Kathleen Thomas of the
University of North Carolina and William Weissert of the University
of Michigan, under a grant from the AARP.

It analyzed policies marketed from May through July of 1988 and
acknowledged improvements in policies since then.

Most of the policies studied denied benefits to those who went into
nursing homes without first being hospitalized or provided benefits
only for skilled -- as opposed to custodial -- nursing home care.
Those findings confirm the wisdom of a December 1988 recommendation
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that states
prohibit sale of policies with such requirements, the report said.

It recommended that the NAIC expand its model regulations to require
that policies cover at least four years in a nursing home and offer
some kind of inflation protection.

The study named the companies whose policies were analyzed, but
didn't provide specific information on each policy.

Companies included Aetna, American Express-Fireman's Fund, American
Progressive, Bankers Life & Casualty, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of
Indiana, Equitable Life & Casualty, Great Republic, John Hancock,
Prudential, Transport Life and Travelers.

According to the Health Insurance Association of America, more than
100 companies now offer insurance covering long-term care.

WORLD'S REPORTED AIDS CASES TOPPED 200,000 IN 1989

The number of reported AIDS cases reached 203,599 by the end of 1989,
the World Health Organization reported Jan. 3.

The total included 36,942 new victims during the year.

U.S. cases totaled 113,211 by December.

Reports to the Geneva-based WHO seriously underestimate the actual
number because many cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
particularly in Africa, go undetected.

HEALTH COSTS CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION

Standard & Poor's Corp. says medical costs rose 8 percent from
October 1988 through September 1989, compared to an overall inflation
rate of 4.3 percent.

It said inflation has slowed in dental and eye care, but costs of
hospitals and drugs rose 11.8 percent.

S&P said it expected the inflation rate for health costs to outpace
overall inflation by "a wide margin" in 1990 -- matched only by an
increase in the 10 to 12 percent range for property/casualty
premiums.

TREASURY DECIDES TO SEND OUT MEDICARE REFUNDS IN FEBRUARY

Under pressure from members of Congress, the Treasury Department has
announced that it will send out refund checks in February and April
to nearly 27 million elderly Americans who are paying for benefits
they won't be receiving.

Congress acted late last year to repeal the Medicare Catastrophic
Coverage Act of 1988, which increased both Medicare benefits and the
premiums to pay for them.

Many Medicare premiums are paid through monthly deductions from
Social Security checks, and those deductions went up by $5.30 as of
Jan. 1. Treasury said it didn't have time to reprogram the computers
to reduce the deductions before May, but said it could refund the
money.

F.T.C. LETTER ON CRASH PARTS GIVES COMPETITIVENESS ARGUMENTS A BOOST

A letter from Federal Trade Commission staff to an Ohio legislator
gives a boost to arguments that there are anticompetitive effects
from laws restricting use of replacement crash parts made by other
than the original manufacturers.

The argument pits auto manufacturers, who decry use of "imitation"
parts, against insurers and consumer groups, who say competition
lowers prices of replacement parts.

The letter from FTC staff to Ohio State Rep. Joseph E. Haines, came
in response to a request for comment on an Ohio bill, H.B. 302. It
appears to mark the first time a U.S. government agency has taken a
position on the issue -- even though it represents staff views and
not those of the commission.

The Dec. 27 letter suggests that the Legislature "take into account
the possibility that the bill might unreasonably restrict consumer
choice in the market for auto crash parts. The Legislature may also
wish to take into consideration the benefits and costs of mandatory
disclosure."

The Ohio bill regulates marketing and use of aftermarket crash parts,
including a requirement that installers can't charge more for parts
made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) than they would
have for non-OEM parts.

"This provision attempts to equalize the prices of OEM and non-OEM
parts, thus eliminating perhaps the only attraction of non-OEM
parts," the FTC staff said.

The measure also requires disclosure that non-OEM parts, "most of
which are not made in the United States, may vary in terms of
quality, fit, performance and warranty from the original parts."

The FTC staff said it wouldn't address the question of poorer
quality, but added that some consumers might be willing to accept
lower quality in order to get a lower price.

The disclosure might add to costs without providing useful additional
information to consumers, the FTC staff said. And, it said, "there is
a risk that the language of a mandatory disclosure may mislead
consumers, creating a negative public perception where none is
justified."

GOVERNMENT PROPOSES EXTENDING AIRBAG REQUIREMENT TO TRUCKS & VANS

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed Jan. 4
that the current requirement for airbags or automatic seatbelts be
extended to light-duty trucks, vans and small buses.

The restraints would be phased in beginning with the 1994 model year
with full compliance by the 1996 model year. But vehicles with driver-
side airbags and manual passenger belts would be considered in
compliance through the 1997 model year.

Vehicles with only two seating positions also would have to be
equipped to secure a child safety seat on the passenger side.

NHTSA estimated that some 2,000 lives a year could be saved through
the proposal.

The action followed a NHTSA proposal last month to extend the door-
strength requirements for passenger cars to all minivans, small buses
and multipurpose vehicles.

NHTSA also reported that it opened a record 213 investigations into
possible auto safety defects during 1989 and influenced a record 77
percent of recalls.

AGENTS & CONSUMER ADVOCATES OFFER 100 WAYS TO CUT AUTO COSTS

The National Association of Professional Insurance Agents and the
Consumer Insurance Interest Group joined Dec. 27 to offer more than
100 recommendations on controlling personal injury and property
damage costs.

Suggestions include ways to improve driver responsiblility, speed and
alcohol control, highway design and improved state record-keeping on
accidents.

The groups also recommended improving vehicle safety by such means as
displaying crashworthiness ratings on new vehicles, improving
steering assemblies, enhancing side-impact protection and reinstating
the 5 mph bumper standard.

The Consumer Insurance Interest Group is headed by PIA National
consumer adviser Esther Peterson and includes Joan Claybrook of
Public Citizen, Steve Brobeck of Consumer Federation of America and
J. Robert Hunter of the National Insurance Consumer Organization.

The organization was formed at the behest of PIA National in an
effort to reach agreement on issues of common interest, such as
safety, while setting aside issues that divide the two groups.

"All the recommendations in this report should be looked upon
together rather than as isolated proposals," Peterson said.

The agents and consumer advocates agreed that another issue --
insurer efficiency -- also is important, but they couldn't agree on
how to achieve it.

The 40-page report, "Factors Contributing to Auto Insurance Claims
Costs," is available from PIA National at 400 North Washington St.,
Alexandria, VA 22314, telephone 703-836-9340.

HARTFORD EXPANDS DISCOUNTS FOR AUTO SAFETY

ITT Hartford Insurance Group, which claims credit for pioneering
discounts for airbags or automatic seatbelts in 1977, announced Jan.
4 that it is increasing those discounts.

The Hartford's discounts on personal injury coverage for occupants of
the insurance vehicles are 30 percent for automatic seatbelts, 40
percent for driver-side airbags, 50 percent for full front airbags
and 60 percent for a combination of both automatic belts and airbags.

They apply to personal injury protection (PIP) coverage in no-fault
staes and to medical payments coverage in other states.

In addition, cars with antilock brakes will get a 5 percent saving on
collision coverage.

"The discounts are substantially greater than those offered by most
auto insurers," according to Dale R. Comey, The Hartford's president
of property-casualty insurance operations.

The company said actual dollar savings will vary by state, ranging
from $102 in the no-fault state of Colorado down to $9 in Illinois,
where tort suits are allowed and first-party medical coverage is more
limited.

As of Feb. 1, the discounts will be available in 38 states on
policies sold by independent agents or through the American
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), The Travelers said. They are
under consideration in five other jurisdictions.

CALIFORNIA QUAKE EXPECTED TO HAVE LITTLE LASTING ECONOMIC IMPACT

Last year's Loma Prieta earthquake won't have a severe lingering
economic impact and rebuilding will probably stimulate the San
Francisco Bay area, the Commission on State Finance reported
Jan. 3 in its budget projection for the 1990s.

Some businesses and households will suffer huge uninsured casualty
losses and some small retailers will go bankrupt because of a decline
in tourism, the commission said, but "the net loss in wealth and
income is not that large."

The panel estimated that the Oct. 17 earthquake will cost the state
$1.035 billion, most of it offset by a quarter-cent increase in the
sales tax enacted Dec. 1.

CALIFORNIA'S NEW WORKERS' COMP LAW GOES INTO EFFECT

California's new workers' compensation law went into effect Jan. 1,
raising maximum weekly benefits from $224 to $266 immediately and
more in later years.

The law also imposes requirements on employers to inform injured
workers of claims procedures and act on them promptly and contains
reforms intended to reduce the amount of litigation.

Insurers' uniform provision for expenses goes down from
35 percent to 34 percent this year, 33 percent next year and
32.8 percent in 1992.

DELAWARE GOVERNOR RENEWS PUSH FOR BANKS IN INSURANCE

Delaware Gov. Mike Castle has renewed his drive to win passage of
legislation that would allow some state banks into the insurance
business.

The Republican governor told the Wilmington Rotary Club Dec. 28 that
passage is important if Delaware is to continue to be a financial
center.

The measure would help encourage banks to stay in the state and
expand, Castle said, but he warned that California, Florida and
Illinois all are considering similar legislation.

"The first state in which national and regional banks are located, or
may locate, which grants these insurance underwriting powers to
commercial banks...will have foreclosed any need or reason for
similar action by other states," said Castle.

He said one major backer of the legislation, Citibank, has said it
would create up to 500 new jobs in Delaware if the bill passes.

Insurance agents oppose the bill, which would apply to banks
chartered in the state before 1933 and allow them both to underwrite
and sell insurance.

It was passed by the House but has been stalled in the Senate since
last summer.

GEORGIA COMMISSIONER PROPOSES LIMITS ON AUTO PERSONAL INJURY SUITS

Georgia Insurance Commissioner Warren Evans proposed Jan. 4 that the
General Assembly revise the state's no-fault law by allowing suits
only in case of defined injuries.

Current law now calls for accident victims' insurance companies to
pay medical bills, lost wages and burial expenses regardless of who
was at fault, but injured persons may still sue
if their medical expenses exceed $500.

Evans told a House-Senate study committee that the proposal would
allow insurers to cut costs and could lead to a 20 percent reduction
in premiums.

The effort to raise the tort threshold is being led by Georgians for
Responsible Insurance Policy, an industry coalition headed by Dedley
Moore of Atlanta's Omni Insurance Group.

"The exorbitant increase in tort litigation is one of the main
reasons Georgia's insurance rates have been climbing faster than the
national average," Moore said.

But the Georgia Consumer Center says that auto rate increases in the
state have outpaced the growth of claims.

The group's executive director, Debbie Schecter, said claims only
amounted to 69.4 percent of premiums in 1988, compared to 79.3
percent in 1984.

"It's further evidence of the inefficiency in the insurance industry
in Georgia and perhaps even price-gouging," she said.

In other areas, Insurance Commissioner Evans proposed:

* Requiring health insurers to pool policies for groups with fewer
than 50 members, in order to reduce the possibility of a large rate
increase resulting from one large claim on a small group.

* Making health maintenance organizations available to those covered
by Medicare or Medicaid who now lack that option.

* Expanding the Insurance Department's ability to investigate
insurance fraud. He said it's been estimated that at least 10 to 20
percent of the cost of premiums results from fraud.

* Extending the FAIR Plan providing property insurance to high-risk
applicants who have difficulty getting commercial coverage.

ILLINOIS MANDATORY AUTO INSURANCE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT

An Illinois law requiring motorists to carry auto insurance went into
effect Jan. 1, allowing state troopers to require motorists to prove
that they have personal injury liability coverage of at least $20,000
per person and $40,000 per accident.

The law also requires $15,000 in property damage liability.

Motorists without insurance face fines of $500 or more and vehicle
registration suspensions of at least two months. Reinstatement will
cost an additional $50.

ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT SAYS DRUNK EMPLOYE CAN'T GET WORKERS' COMP

The Illinois Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21 that an intoxicated employee
who was critically injured in a car crash while traveling between one
business meeting and another isn't entitled to workers' compensation.

Without dissent, the court upheld the ruling of the Illinois
Industrial Commission that the employee wasn't capable of working at
the time of the accident and therefore wasn't eligible for workers'
compensation.

The case was brought by the family of Bennie Johnson, a business
agent for the International Union of Operating Engineers. He had a
blood alcohol level of nearly .24 percent, more than two times the
legal definition of drunkenness, at the time of the 1983 accident
that left him incapacitated.

"The commission was free to infer from those circumstances that the
employee was so intoxicated that he could no longer follow his
employment and thus could not be said to be engaged in his employment
at the time of the occurrence," Justice Ben Miller wrote for the
court.

MARYLAND APPROVES BLUES' PLAN TO ENCOURAGE SAFE DRIVING

Maryland Insurance Commission John Donaho has approved a plan by Blue
Cross & Blue Shield of Maryland to encourage safe driving through
expanded benefits.

The plan applies to some 37,000 policyholders enrolled in
comprehensive major medical programs for individual consumers.

If a policyholder is injured in a traffic accident while using a
seatbelt, child restraint or motorcycle helmet, 100 percent of the
first $1,500 in covered medical costs will be paid.

Previously, the company paid 80 percent of such costs.

Donaho also approved a provision withholding benefits when a
policyholder is injured in an accident and convicted for the second
time of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of
unprescribed drugs.

Another provision extends coverage to policyholders for routine
mammography screenings.

"Our emphasis on safe driving, prevention and wellness place us and
the state of Maryland in the forefront of a national trend that
encourages people to take responsibility for actions that affect
their health," said Linda Benedict, vice president of the insurer's
individual market division.

MASSACHUSETTS LIMIT ON AUTO RATE INCREASE CHALLENGED IN COURT

Aetna Life & Casualty Co. filed suit Jan. 3 challenging  the
Massachusetts insurance commissioner's decision last month limiting
auto rate increases to 7.9 percent.

The suit filed in Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest, noted
that insurers had sought a 12.8 percent increase.

Aetna covers about 9.5 percent of the state's drivers, but a decision
in its favor would affect other insurers as well.

MICHIGAN AGENTS SAY INCREASING SAFETY COULD REDUCE AUTO RATES

The Michigan Association of Professional Insurance Agents is saying
government should increase safety regulation as a means of holding
down auto premiums.

Michigan PIA's proposals include reducing the maximum speed limit
from 65 mph and more funding for highway maintenance and safer roads.
The agents also propose increased funding for insurance regulation
and a new look at the territorial rating system.

"Our recommendations are designed to provide a credible base of
information that everyone can work on to reduce accidents and
injuries and hold the line on rising auto insurance rates," said
Michigan PIA President James Alexander.

The PIA recommendations are part of an effort to divert legislative
proposals to mandate reduced auto premiums by as much as 30 percent.

Although Michigan's no-fault system is held up as a model for other
states, auto rates there have been rising -- especially in Detroit.

Michigan Citizens Lobby has been leading a campaign for rate cuts.
The group's executive director responded to the PIA proposals by
saying they're a step in the right direction but shouldn't divert
attention from the push for a rate rollback.

MISSOURI SENATOR PROPOSES UPGRADING INSURANCE REGULATION

Missouri Senate President Pro Tem James Mathewson urged Jan. 3 that
the state constitution be amended to upgrade insurance regulation to
the status of a separate department.

"For too many years, our Division of Insurance has been the stepchild
of the Department of Economic Development," the Democratic leader
said.

"In order to assure Missouri consumers they are not paying
unreasonable rates and to make sure the insurance industry is
adequately related, we need to have a separate department in charge
of insurance regulation."

Under Mathewson's amendment, the proposed department would be
directed by a five-member commission.

"I have talked to officials with major insurance companies, fellow
lawmakers and consumer representatives," Mathewson said.

"We agree that in light of the growing public concern with insurance
rates and the increasing number of insurance company insolvencies, we
need improved regulation of the industry."

The amendment would have to be approved by both houses of the General
Assembly and then approved by voters.

NEW JERSEY BLUES WIN APPROVAL OF RATE INCREASES

New Jersey Insurance Commissioner Kenneth Merin approved rate
increases in excess of 20 percent Jan. 4 for 600,000 residents of the
state who carry health insurance with Blue Cross & Blue Shield of New
Jersey.

Merin approved increases of 26.4 percent for 350,000 holders of
individual health insurance policies and of 21.3 percent for 250,000
who carry Medicare supplemental coverage.

The increases are expected to bring $97 million more this year to
Blue Cross & Blue Shield, which has reported a $230 million deficit.

If applied across the board, the increases would amount to about $950
above the current $3,600 annual non-group premium for family coverage
and $98 above the current Medigap average of $460. But Merin ordered
Blue Cross & Blue Shield to modify the demographic factors used in
setting rates.

The company had sought a 33.7 percent increase for individual
coverage and 28.9 percent for Medigap policies.

Merin said medical costs haven't risen as much as Blue Cross & Blue
Shield claimed.

About 3.4 million more residents of the state are covered by Blue
Cross & Blue Shield group plans, which aren't affected by the latest
decision.

NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSIONER ORDERS ANOTHER AUTO RATE ROLLBACK

North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Jim Long has ordered auto rates
rolled back by 6.2 percent, the third cut in less than two years.

"I have determined that the evidence and testimony justify a decrease
in the current rate level," Long said Dec. 28.

"Decreases are ordered for both liability and physical damage
coverage."

Long also ordered a 12.1 percent decrease for motorcycles.

The industry had requested a 4.2 percent increase.

"The order represents a 248 percent decrease from the industry's
request," Long said.

"The last six auto rate orders represent a total of $492 million less
than the increased rate levels proposed by the insurance industry."

Besides ordering three rate cuts, Long has approved three rate
increases that were smaller than those requested by the industry.

The industry has taken previous decisions to the North Carolina Court
of Appeals, and more than $115 million in premiums is being held in
escrow pending the outcome.

NORTH CAROLINA ANTI-THEFT PROGRAM PAYS ITS FIRST REWARD

North Carolina's Stop Thefts, Assist Recoveries (STAR) program has
paid its first reward: $2,000 to an informant who helped bring about
the conviction of six persons in Brunswick County believed
responsible for $120,000 in burglaries.

"This is the first money to be paid through the industry's STAR
reward program and we believe this is only the beginning of a very
effective program to assist North Carolina law enforcement agencies
in fighting burglary rings," said William L. Pollard, executive vice
president of North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. and
chairman of the STAR reward committee.

"Our target for STAR is the thief or theft ring that commits 10 or
more burglaries or steals 10 or more vehicles. We call them high-
volume thieves," Pollard said Jan. 4.

The North Carolina Rate Bureau, made up of property/
casualty insurers, will put up as much as $20,000 a year for rewards.
Co-sponsors of the program are the North Carolina Association of
Police Chiefs and the North Carolina Sheriffs Association.

OREGON SUPREME COURT REQUIRES BROAD COVERAGE BY AUTO POLICIES

The Oregon Supreme Court ruled Dec. 28 that auto insurers doing
business in the state must cover vehicles owned by the policy-holder
even when the vehicles are being driven by someone else.

Ruling in two different cases, both involving Viking Insurance Co. of
Wisconsin, the court said Oregon law requires policies to cover
vehicles all the time, not just when they are being driven by certain
people.

One case involved a policy held by an Oregon man, Grant Perotti, that
covered him when he was driving any vehicle but didn't cover his
truck when it was driven by someone else. An employee of Perotti's,
driving the truck with his permission, was involved in an accident
and Viking refused to cover damages.

The other case involved a policyholder who allowed his car to be
driven by a 19-year-old woman who was involved in an accident. Viking
said its policy didn't apply in this case because a clause in the
policy excluded a vehicle driven by someone under 25.

TENNESSEE REPORTS 42% OF BIRTHS PAID FOR BY MEDICAID

Medicaid paid for 42 percent of all births in Tennessee last year and
the proportion is expected to rise above 50 percent this year, State
Health and Environment Commissioner J.W. Luna told legislators Dec.
28.

The other 58 percent of births were paid for by the parents and their
insurance or were written off by the hospitals as bad debts, Luna
told the Legislature's Fiscal Review Committee.

VIRGINIA CITES LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT MANDATED BENEFITS RAISE COSTS

Virginia's State Corporation Commission issued a report Dec. 27
saying that it was unable to find clear evidence that removing
mandated benefits would make health insurance more affordable.

It told the General Assembly's joint subcommittee on health care that
all mandated benefits and providers account for, on average, no more
than 10 percent of the policy premium for individual coverage and 20
percent of the group premium.

The study said it's impossible to answer the crucial question of how
many people are uninsured as a result of mandated benefits, because
insurance companies don't normally keep such data.

The report was based on a survey of 100 companies.

Insurance Commissioner Steven Foster suggested that the General
Assembly enact legislation requiring insurers to keep such data for
future use, as seven other states have done.

Having such data might make it possible to consider options such as
allowing consumers to get cheaper insurance by agreeing to forgo some
kinds of treatment, such as mental health therapy.

The state now requires insurers to provide coverage, for example, for
newborn children and in-patient psychiatric services and it requires
them to offer coverage for mammograms, obstetrical care and alcohol
and drug dependency.

It also requires insurers to reimburse a variety of health-care
providers, including clinical social workers, psychologists,
chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists and opticians.

WISCONSIN BILL WOULD BROADEN POLICYHOLDER REDRESS AGAINST INSURERS

Wisconsin State Rep. Peter Barca introduced legislation Dec. 28 that
would call for hearing examiners to decide monetary awards in
contested cases and allow policyholders to recover attorney's fees
when they sue insurers.

The measure also would create a public intervenor in insurance cases
in the Wisconsin Justice Department as well as requiring insurers to
publish their rates and file an annual report showing premiums
collected, claims paid and court awards.

The Democratic legislator said he was introducing the bill in light
of a state audit critical of a lack of consumer protections.

BUILDING CODES HELP PREVENT HURRICANE DAMAGE, STUDY FINDS

Strong building codes, properly enforced, can greatly reduce damage
from hurricanes, according to a new report by the All-Industry
Research Advisory Council.

The study was undertaken in cooperation with the National Committee
on Property Insurance and covered Hurricanes Alicia (1983), Diana
(1984), Gloria (1985) and Gilbert (1988), as well as last year's
Hurricane Hugo.

It found evidence that counties with strong codes and enforcement in
some areas, such as Charleston County, held down damage. It also
found trees were a mixed blessing -- causing damage from falling
limbs but reducing the impact of hurricane-force winds.

Single copies of the study, "Surviving the Storm: Building Codes,
Compliance, and the Mitigation of Hurricane Damage," are available
free from AIRAC at 1200 Harger Road, Suite 310, Oak Brook, IL 60521,
telephone 708-572-1177.
