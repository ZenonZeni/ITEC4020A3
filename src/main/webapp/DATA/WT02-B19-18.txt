<h1> Civil and Mining Engineering Foundation</h1>
The Postgraduate Civil Engineering Foundation was established in February 1968, as a development of the already existing links between the Department of Civil Engineering and industry and following the pattern of the early University foundations. The name was changed to the Civil and Mining Engineering Foundation in 1986 following amalgamation of the corresponding departments.<P>
The Foundation actively fosters collaboration between the Civil and Mining Engineering School and the engineering profession and industry. It does so in several important ways:
<ul>
<li> by promoting engineering consultation, research, training, public lectures, special short courses and technical reporting,
<li>by providing direction to undergraduate and post-graduate educational programs,
<li>by sponsoring research projects in the School and encouraging research links with industry,
<li>by serving as a focus for the exchange of local and overseas expertise,
<li>by forming working committees of top engineers from government, consulting practices, the civil and mining industry and the University to study topical issues arising in the engineering profession, and
<li>by reporting the important results of all these activities to members and the public through reports and engineering publications.
</ul>
The Foundation is supported by annual subscriptions from its governors, members and by special donors.
