<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Los Angeles — Looking to expand its fleet of clean-air vehicles, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) officials are soliciting bids for 39 new alternative-fueled vehicles. The Department of Airports is looking to buy 10 liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered transit buses, eight bi-fuel pickup trucks, 16 bi-fuel sedans, and five police sedans powered only by compressed natural gas (CNG). The bi-fuel vehicles are to be capable of running on either gasoline or an alternative fuel. LAX already operates 21 buses on LNG; with another 6 already on order, 71 percent of its 52-bus fleet will operate on the cleaner-burning fuel. The remaining buses will later be converted to LNG. According to the request for bids, LAX estimates the vehicle costs at $300,000 per bus, $25,000 apiece for the bi-fuel vehicles and $30,000 for the CNG police cars.
