<P>
Warrnambool and District is one of Victoria's leading provincial
areas, with a population of 25,000 within the city and approximately
36,000 in the immediate region.  The City of Warrnambool is 
one of Victoria's major centres.
<P>
<img src="gifs2/warcoast.gif" align=right>
Warrnambool is a flourishing coastal city 260 km west of Melbourne.
It is the largest along the state's ocean coastline and Victoria's
sixth largest city.
</FONT>
<P>
A unique balance exists between economic development and lifestyle,
and Warrnambool provides attractive cultural and recreational facilities
more typical of a larger centre.
<P>
The name Warrnambool, derived from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;Plenty
of Water&quot;, reflects Warrnambool's geographic location between
the Hopkins River to the east and the Merri River to the west.
<P>
A variety of manufacturing, service, tourism and retail operations
contribute to the city's economy, and over 80 per cent of the
manufacturing workforce is employed by local industries such as
Kraft,
Warrnambool Cheese and Butter, Murray Goulburn, Nestles and Fletcher
Jones.
<P>
In addition to manufacturing, Warrnambool has a strong tourism
and service sector.  Tourism alone generates over $60 million
annually and supports more than 2,500 jobs.
<H2>Transport facilities</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/wartown.gif" align=right>
The City of Warrnambool is located on the Princes Highway, which
provides direct road links to Adelaide, Geelong and Melbourne.
<P>
The city is the terminus of the privately operated rail link &quot;South
Coast Rail&quot; to Melbourne, providing industry with an extensive
rail freight service.
<P>
Warrnambool and District is well placed for shipping.  The Port
of Portland, one of the few deep water ports in Australia, is
only 100 kilometres away by road.
<H2>Natural growth</H2>

<P>
Warrnambool and District has abundant natural resources.  Natural
gas from the Otway Basin provides local industries with a cost-efficient
energy source.  A number of Warrnambool's high volume energy consumers
have already made the change to gas, including Fletcher Jones,
Kraft Foods, Nestles, Warrnambool Cheese and Butter and Deakin
University.
<P>
Local geothermal energy has the potential to provide power to
business and commerce, especially in the aquaculture, greenhouse,
and process heating industries.
<P>
Warrnambool has an excellent quality water supply from the Otway
Ranges.  Dairy farming continues to be one of the major agricultural
activities in the southwest, and most of the milk is now processed
locally by Warrnambool Cheese and Butter, Kraft Foods and Nestles.
<H2>Future opportunities for growth</H2>

<P>
The region's primary produce offers a considerable capacity for
further value adding industries.  Opportunities exist for specialty
cheese makers, for example, to take advantage of the region's
excellent dairy produce.  Similarly, processors have access to
a considerable local potato crop.
<P>
The region's natural resources are supported by a city determined
to assist development by ensuring the necessary road, rail, air
and sea infrastructure are in place.  Deakin University is cooperating
with local industries to develop new ventures like commercial
yabby farming.
<P>
The development of Warrnambool's tourist opportunities and the
flow-on benefits to accompanying service industries, such as accommodation
houses, restaurants and entertainment facilities, offers potential
business opportunities for investors.
<P>
The region has beautiful beaches, cliff formations, heritage walks,
museums and modern shopping centres.  Natural attractions around
Warrnambool, including the Southern Right Whale nursery at Logan's
Beach, the Twelve Apostles, Hopkins Falls and Tower Hill make
this one of the most visually exciting, yet easily accessible
coastlines in Australia.
<P>
The region hosts horse racing and folk music festivals, and it
has a unique social history, reflected in the names of local settlements
like Killarney and Belfast.
<P>
Apart from natural wonders, the region holds a mystery surrounding
the elusive Mahogany Ship.  Other attractions such as Flagstaff
Hill Maritime Museum and the Lake Pertobe Adventure Playground
encourage tourism.
<P>
Logan's Beach attracts international attention as Australia's
Southern Right Whale nursery.  Each winter, between July and October,
Southern Right Whales come within view of the shoreline to calf.
<H2>Premier town</H2>

<P>
Warrnambool and District provides fine beaches and gardens, and
impressive annual cultural and sporting events.  The City of Warrnambool
has had the honour of receiving Victoria's 'Premier Town Award' three
times.
<P>
Warrnambool offers opportunities for investment in industry and
an excellent lifestyle.
