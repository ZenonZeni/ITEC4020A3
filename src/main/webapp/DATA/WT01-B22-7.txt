<h2>STATEMENT OF DR. WALTER BROMBERG<br>
</h2>

<p><b>SENIOR PSYCHIATRIST <br>
DEPARTMENT OF HOSPITALS, CITY OF NEW YORK.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. BROMBERG: To start with, my interest in this Marihuana
problem began in 1933 when I reported at Bellevue Hospital a
group of 11 cases of mental reactions induced by smoking
Marihuana and I reviewed the literature and medical knowledge at
that time. Also, the experience which I obtained was at the
Psychiatric Clinic of the Court of General Sessions <br>
over a period of six years. Persons showing overt mental symptoms
were brought to the hospital by interested relatives and
occasionally on a magistrate's order. For that reason, the vast
majority of Marihuana smokers did not reach the hospital. Cases
which came before the Clinic had passed through the Court of
General Sessions and had been arraigned, indicted and convicted
of a felony.<br>
<br>
There has been considerable literature on the intoxication and
insanity-producing effect of Cannabis, in papers from Asia,
Europe, and the United States. To sum up this material concisely,
it can be said that the several types of syndromes recognized
fall into three groups: (a) <br>
intoxication, (b) toxic psychosis with or without admixture of
other types of mental reactions (schizophrenia, manic-depressive)
and (c) according to Eastern European and Asiatic observers,
chronic dementia and deterioration following prolonged use of the
drug. Apparently this latter type of deteriorating process has
not been observed in American clinics.<br>
<br>
Our experience with mental conditions following Marihuana
indicate to us that there are two categories of mental reaction.
The following classification is suggested:<br>
<br>
Acute intoxication (Marihuana Psychosis) Containing sensory,
motor and subjective elements, lasting hours to several days,
often with anxiety or hysterical reactions, and panic states and
depressions of transient nature.<br>
Toxic Psychoses (a) in which there are many admixtures of
disturbed sensorlum, delusional and emotional reactions amounting
to psychosis, but with the common characteristic toxic signs and
(b) functional psychoses of a typical variety, initiated by
Marihuana or colored by Marihuana in their symptomatology, but
which continue in the form of the underlying psychosis. In these
cases Marihuana represents an incipient stage in the psychosis,
apparently.<br>
<br>
There were 14 cases of Acute Intoxication and 17 of Toxic
psychosis. <br>
<br>
The point at which the line is drawn between acute intoxicating
due to Marihuana and psychosis due to Marihuana depends on the
degree and severity of the symptoms. Acute intoxications, induced
by smoking one to four cigarettes, bring about after an interval
varying from one-half to five hours in the individual one or all
of the following symptoms: an increase in motor activity, a
feeling of excitement, mental confusion, disorientation, crowding
of perception, elementary visual illusions and hallucinations,
euphoria and talkativeness. In addition to these symptoms,
numerous subjective experiences occur, such as increased speed of
thought processes, a feeling of intellectual brilliance, change
in time perception, various somatic feelings, dizziness, hunger,
a feeling of swelling of the head, lightness of the extremities,
a sensation of walking on air, lengthening of the limbs and
sexual illusions. More often sex excitement consists in the fact
that the possible sexual objects in his environment become
extraordinarily desirable. There is abundant evidence in our
clinical and experimental material to show that the stimulus for
sexual <br>
interest and activity derives from the aesthetic enhancement of
objects in the environment. It is not so much a matter of
increased potency on the part of the user as increased reaction
to sexual fantasies and illusions. One of our patients said:
&quot;I saw black and white women lying in bed with legs
separated, as if expecting men . . . some women in the park with
nothing on, doing nasty dances, moving their hips. I chased after
them.&quot; Others state women appear amazingly beautiful.
Another patient said: &quot;In the subway I felt very sexy. I
wanted to touch every woman that passed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The speeded-up physical motility has its counterpart in rapid
speech. There is a feeling on the part of the individual that he
is witty, even brilliant; his ideas flow quickly and words come
readily to the tongue. Conclusions and answers seem to come to
mind ready-formed and surprisingly clear, without the effort of
thinking. This feelings of clarity is, of course, spurious.
Actually the productions of the intoxicant are hard to follow,
for when he wishes to explain what he has thought there is only
confusion. The rapid flow of ideas gives a subjective impression
of brilliance of thought and observation. The sense of increased
speed of thinking apparently has an effect on memory - hence the
confusion that appears on trying to recall what was thought
during the intoxication.<br>
<br>
The smoker finds it pleasant to be with others and to impart his
experiences to them. This is reflected in the fact that Marihuana
is ordinarily smoked at parties or in groups. It is felt that
this need for a social setting is a reaction to an inner anxiety
arising from the threat of bodily destruction implied in somatic
illusions induced by Marihuana In the ordinary case of smoking
Marihuana, especially with one who is used to the drug, this
threat becomes converted to euphoria which develops to
uncontrollable fits of laughter. Nevertheless inquiry shows that
almost every smoker is aware of definite uneasiness at the outset
of the intoxication. The description from smokers in Harlem and
from experimental subjects agrees on this point. In the words of
a user of two years' standing, initiates &quot;shrink together,
feel tight inside and get <br>
frightened.&quot; After they smoke it more than once, the reality
of these frightening somatic illusions becomes less. In
occasional instances, and these are the cases which are apt to
come to medical attention, the fear of death, of insanity, of
bodily deformity and of bodily dissolution are startling. These
patients are tense, nervous, frightened, they may develop a state
of panic. Often <br>
suicide or assaultive acts are the result of these emotional
states. The anxiety state is so common in patients admitted to
the hospital for uncomplicated Marihuana psychosis, that it can
be considered part of the intoxication syndrome.<br>
<br>
Notes taken on experimental subjects who were psychologically
trained illustrate these points:<br>
<br>
Subject l. Two cigarettes were smoked within 40 minutes.
Immediately after the second a feeling of lightness in vertex of
head was felt. Head was expanding; there was a feeling of mild
excitement. Now the head felt heavy and there was a definite
feeling of lengthening in the legs <br>
and a tension in the back muscles of the thigh. Head felt
alternately light and heavy. There was a sensation as though the
top of the head were lifted with about four inch increase in
height, accompanied by optic images of skulls and skeletons.
Feeling of the arms rising up in the air. <br>
Subject was aware of a feeling of confusion. Suddenly he saw
images of legs and arms in a dissecting room which were
terrifying. <br>
</p>

<p>Subject 2. &quot;I felt a little euphoric at first, but with
the first draw my heart feels faster, my eyes a little heavier. I
feel myself perspiring all over, and shaking. I can feel a slight
dizziness. I feel weak; the dizziness has left and I am
perspiring (Asked to walk around the room. Refuses to do <br>
so and becomes negativistic). On looking back I remembered that I
had sexual thoughts during the time of the experiment. Time seems
to pass in a peculiar way, there being a combination of fastness
and slowness. I took my first inhalation a few minutes after 9
and when I looked at the clock and saw it was 10 after 9. I was
very much surprised because it seemed like hours. The whole
experiment seems now as if it lasted much longer than it did.
Walking home I walked slowly in front of oncoming cars and felt a
sense of recklessness connected with not being able to walk
faster and not caring.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is remarkable how much anxiety is developed when one looks for
experimental subjects among laymen. The drug is popularly
supposed to release aggressive and sexual impulses beyond the
point of control; it is also regarded as being habit-forming. The
legendary history and social connotation of hashish smoking may
help to develop in those who have had no experience with the
drug, a series of anxieties masking sexual fantasies and
aggressive impulses. This has come almost to the point of mass
hysteria. Some public officials are unwilling to allow the use of
Marihuana cigarettes for experimentation purposes, on the ground
that it may be &quot;immoral,&quot; tending to foster the
development of drug addiction among the public. This frequent
anxiety concerning Cannabis may have as its source the feeling of
dissolution and other somatic changes induced in smokers which is
communicated somehow to the non-smoking public.<br>
<br>
In clinical material as indicated, Marihuana effects may range
from mild intoxications to transitory psychoses which require
psychiatric aid. The effects vary and not all the symptoms occur
in every case. Illustrative of the Marihuana psychosis with
anxiety reactions, and somatic sensory distortions:<br>
A 31 year old white man, admitted March 27, 1934, with a history
of having smoked just one cigarette. On admission the patient was
depressed, retarded, apprehensive. He admitted smoking Marihuana.
Was oriented and memory showed no defects. Physical examination
was negative. The patient states, &quot;My hand began to feel
blue all of a sudden. I felt like laughing and I felt funny in my
head. it was the queerest feeling I ever had. I felt like I was
kind of fainting away like. I sweat and then I'd get kind of
chilly. I got the scare of my life. I thought I was going to die
and everything else. I knew what was happening all the time. I
thought my hands were beginning to get blue. My throat began to
get kind of dry. It was a little better than getting drunk. I did
not want to step down from the curb—it seemed to be so high. I
was sitting down and was afraid to get up.&quot; Patient improved
and on the second day was less apprehensive, was pleasant and
cheerful. He was discharged as recovered, after two days.<br>
<br>
This case demonstrates visual illusions, which recall the
megalopsia (perceiving objects larger than they are), and more
common micropsia, which has been reported experimentally and
clinically. It is this type of illusion, induced by hashish, that
may have been the basis for the story of Aladdin who saw the
tremendous genie emerge from his lamp spout in the Arabian
Nights' tale.<br>
<br>
A 32 year old Irish-American, admitted September 17, 1937, with a
history of smoking Marihuana cigarettes two hours prior to
admission. He felt dizzy, wanted to commit suicide by jumping out
of windows, bumping head on the wall, floor, etc. On admission
was uneasy, apprehensive, impulsive. Said, &quot;I feel sick. I'm
going through hell. I saw trucks coming at me getting larger and
I wanted to open the door of the cab and jump out.&quot; He was
discharged as improved in his own custody about 12 hours after
admission. <br>
<br>
A common type of intoxication is indicated in the following case:
<br>
<br>
A 38 year old Negro, admitted April 13, 1934, with history that
he had run out of the house poorly clad and that he had smoked
&quot;artificial&quot; cigarettes. He was confused on admission,
was dazed in appearance and disoriented. He described a lightness
of the head, dizziness and seeing <br>
star-shaped figures before his eyes after smoking a
&quot;doped&quot; cigarette. He was apprehensive on examination.
On the second or third day after admission, apprehension had
disappeared and he was discharged as recovered, being clear,
composed, but unable to account for his earlier excitement.<br>
<br>
It is not uncommon to find the history of admixture of other
drugs or alcohol in Cannabis intoxication. Frequently alcohol
intensifies the Cannabis symptomatology.<br>
<br>
A 27 year old man of old American stock, admitted on June 18,
1933, at his own request. He had been a chronic alcoholic and
displayed definite evidences of psychopathic makeup; had marked
inferiority because of his eyes and body structure. On admission
he appeared to be apprehensive, a little excited, spoke
coherently and relevantly. His experiences were rather clearly
set forth--&quot;I was down on the water-front. A fellow gave me
an Egyptian cigarette to smoke . . . it was hashish. About an
hour afterwards I began to see things. I'd see things flying in
the air. This made me laugh and I'd laugh at things not worth
laughing at. Then I began to see green and other colors flowing
before my eyes. Then things got black. I imagined people were <br>
following me and I screamed in my hotel and got kicked out. I
still see red lines in front of my eyes and other different
colors all stuck together. <br>
</p>

<p>Then I began to hear bells that would get fainter and fainter
and then start again. Imagined someone was after me all evening.
I thought I heard footsteps and saw people ducking in and out of
doorways behind. me. At the time I said to myself maybe it all
affect my eyes. I seen a big splotch in front of me — it was
scarlet— very bright, exceptionally bright. It contracted, then
faded away. I knew all the time it was due to hashish.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second group comprises cases of toxic psychosis due to or
initiated by Cannabis. There may be other toxic agents present,
as alcohol, other drugs, infective or other endogenous elements.
Disordered sensorium, excitement and agitation, retardation,
blocking with emotional rigidity, hallucinations, sensations of
somatic change, delusional experiences may appear in the toxic
psychosis. The psychosis lasts from weeks to months. Often the
mental picture crystallizes out into a schizophrenic or manic
depressive psychosis after several weeks or months (see
paradigm). At the onset of the illness what can be considered
characteristic Cannabis symptom- <br>
atology is discernible. As the underlying functional psychosis
develops, the toxic elements recede.<br>
A boy of 16, admitted February 27, 1934, with statement from the
family that for two months he had been depressed, apprehensive,
worried, scratching his hands in a nervous manner, prayed
constantly. He complained that somebody read his thoughts. On
admission was well <br>
developed and showed no physical signs. Patient was agitated,
depressed, talked constantly in a bizarre manner about the devil
influencing him, etc. Said: &quot;I felt lightly when I was
walking - as if I weighed only 10 pounds. I felt like running my
whole body was light. I felt like jumping. As if I was walking on
air. I felt happy. Then I saw yellow lights all around me. I saw
blue and green too. The colors were more bright than usual. There
are just masses of colors - sometimes I see a black cross with
everything red behind it. That means there is a God. He is
helping me. The devil knows the evil thoughts in me.&quot; This
agitated condition improved and patient was discharged about 3
weeks after admission as a psychosis due to drugs; acute
hallucinatory <br>
episode.<br>
<br>
Patient was readmitted August 1st of that year with a picture of
a depression with schizoid features. On this admission there were
no evidences whatever of the sensory illusions and somatic
feelings that he had previously when he smoked Marihuana. He was
transferred to the state hospital, where he remained four years,
being diagnosed as Paranoid Schizophrenia with Catatonic
Features. There he was restless and overactive. He had a marked
push of speech, expressed ideas of reference and religious
delusions and was manneristic. Said: &quot;I figured the devil
was trying to pull me away from God so I cut a cross on my arm.
Physically I am the same, but mentally I am another person. ...I
feel that people influence me by touching me - like injecting
dope.&quot; Later he was manneristic, grimaced, was untidy,
repeated practically all questions asked, answered briefly and
usually vaguely and would say, &quot;I don' know exactly,&quot;
or &quot;I don't know.&quot; He remained dull, apathetic,
indifferent and mute until the present time.<br>
<br>
The personality factor is of undoubted importance in this group
of individuals. After the toxic state passed off in these
patients in whom the intoxication reaches deeply enough into the
personality, a basic psychotic state developed. At times, the
toxic features are in the background, the personality reactions
being pre-dominant. What the inner relationship is <br>
between Cannabis and the onset of a functional psychotic state is
not always clear. From our observation, the inner reaction to
somatic sensation seems to be vital. Such reactions consisted of
panic states which disappeared as soon as the stimulus (effects
of the drug) faded. It <br>
is generally known in psychopathology that when the perception of
our own bodily sensations is disturbed we are liable to be
profoundly affected psychologically. Disturbances in perception
of the body-model (Korperschema), which is built up of
kinesthetic, tactile, visual and other <br>
stimuli, and integrated into the core of the personality, elicit
some type of reaction. Such disturbances act as a blow to the
ego, invoking defensive reactions of anxiety, apprehension,
projection, etc., which approach or are schizophrenic in their
clinical manifestations. The following case illustrates these
points:<br>
<br>
A 20 year-old colored man admitted February 22, 1936. He is said
by his mother to have been &quot;nervous&quot; for some time,
said he wanted to die, wanted to kill himself. Prior to admission
his mother caught him with a bottle of lysol. He had been
depressed and despondent. He was a boy of superior intelligence
as measured by the Army Alpha test. On admission he stated that
he used Marihuana for several months and during this time he had
heard people talking about him They said' &quot;Oh, what an ugly
boy. How mean-looking he is.&quot; For four months, August to
October, 1935, he smoked three to four cigarettes a day until he
began to feel ill. At first Marihuana made him happy. Then he
felt that he made a peculiar noise in his throat; ate once a day;
was unable to sleep; and experienced auditory hallucinations. The
hallucinations started four months ago and increased gradually.
He thought his face was changing. He looked thin, mean, and ugly;
he became self-conscious. He felt that every-one in the
neighborhood knew it. He stated at times he seemed speeded up,
but his mind was keenly alert with the development of the ideas
of reference, he became self-reproachful, apprehensive and
fearful.<br>
<br>
He was then transferred to a state hospital on March 13, 1936,
where he stated his hallucinations had disappeared and his
emotional reaction improved. After three months he was discharged
to his home; within five months he was readmitted to Bellevue
Hospital, where he had gone in a state of panic, and from where
he was re-committed to a state hospital. He was tense, uneasy,
still retained ideas of reference, acted oddly at home apparently
in response to his delusions. Diagnosis on second admission to
State Hospital was Dementia Praecox Paranoid Type, which was made
about two years after the onset of the original illness.<br>
<br>
Some cases showed the manic-depressive reactions, but these were
in the minority. It is perhaps to be expected that
schizophrenic-like psychoses are more common because individuals
who take to drugs have some deep inadequacy to start with. The
cyclothymic personality is less prone to require the drug.<br>
<br>
A man of 28 who was brought to the hospital by his mother on
February 13, 1938, with the history that he had been smoking
reefers for some time. A year ago he had an episode, was not
hospitalized and improved from it. On admission patient was
confused, restless, apprehen-<br>
sive. He engaged in violent daydreamings. At times he appeared to
be reacting to hallucinations. He said he &quot;had a big
head.&quot; He became talkative, euphoric, elated and overactive
after a day or so. He said: &quot;The best thing for me to do is.
. . you look fine. I've got to look like you . I know what it is
. . . when a Buick and a Packard get together.&quot; His speech
was distinctly flighty, his behavior panicky; was constantly
restless. Would cry, sing, talk.<br>
<br>
He was transferred to a state hospital on February 24, 1938.
There his condition persisted and he became somewhat depressed,
but showed promise of recovery a few months after admission.
Diagnosis at State Hospital was Manic Depressive Psychosis, Manic
Type. <br>
<br>
Mixed reactions merge with the toxic psychoses. These reactions
vary clinically, some occurring in chronic alcoholics, some in
schizophrenics and some in psychopathic personalities, and in all
of them Marihuana usage was a factor. It can be clearly seen that
aside from the direct toxic effect of the drug, the personality
of the patient plays a tremendous role in psychotic states
following Marihuana usage. <br>
<br>
A Cuban, age 34, who was admitted on March 6, 1938, to Bellevue
Hospital. He had been taking Marihuana for one and a half years.
He had jumped in front of a south-bound subway train without
injury. He was very depressed, dull, lackadaisical, despondent in
attitude. <br>
</p>

<p>He was definitely under productive but still strongly
suicidal. He described taking one cigarette every day of
Marihuana for a year and a half because it took his worries away.
For some time he had been conscious that people were looking at
him He feels that his body is heavy all the <br>
time. Sometimes he hears deceased persons talking to him. He sees
lights at times. At times he sees a photograph of a strange
person. <br>
<br>
His friend corroborated the history, stating that he had been in
this depressed condition for 3-4 years. He had a work-house
sentence for 2-3 months for Marihuana. He was transferred to a
state hospital March 18, 1938. At that time he was dull,
preoccupied, but lost his hallucinatory and delusional trends.
The State Hospital diagnosed him as Schizophrenia, Hebephrenic
Type (?) and he was released after two months.<br>
</p>

<p>In some cases the drug makes relatively little difference in
the content of the psychosis. It is for the clinician to
determine how much Marihuana influences the clinical picture. In
South Africa, where dagga (equivalent of Marihuana) smoking is
very widespread, a diagnosis of Marihuana psychosis is made in
any &quot;toxic psychosis where there are very good grounds for
assuming addiction to dagga smoking.&quot; It is felt that there
should be more exact criteria, as we outlined above, for a
diagnosis of Marihuana psychosis, by which we mean the presence
of disordered <br>
sensorium, characteristic colored visual hallucinations, time
changes, subjective and somatic feelings. One is apt to
over-estimate the place of Marihuana in the causation of a
psychotic picture. <br>
</p>

<p>A white man of 28, admitted January 23, 1938, to Bellevue
Hospital with a history that he was in a state hospital in
Arizona for 3 months about two years ago and one in Indiana for 9
months four years ago. &quot;I was smoking this Marihuana weed
(at time of admission to State Hospital in <br>
Arizona). I ran around the desert for a time, ran out nights and
one day knocked on a door and told a woman I was Dillinger. I
tried to see how much water I could walk in. I was just like
hypnotized and walking in my sleep. Sometimes I feel like
something's controlling me. Sometimes I feel just like I'm
talking to somebody with my mouth closed. I just ask them a <br>
question with my brain and they answer. Sometimes it's a man,
sometimes it's a woman's voice; it just works in my temple. I
think it's imagination. It's just like a dream. People stare at
me. Sometimes I see different colors. I had that years ago - just
like a light coming towards me; it's not a light, it's an arc.
His effect was flat and he was dejected and slow-speaking. Showed
<br>
blocking and evasiveness on. sex experiences. Had ideas of
reference and persecutory ideas.<br>
<br>
He was transferred to a state hospital, where he was noted as
being preoccupied, under productive and somewhat dissociated. He
stated that he had some sort of seizures that were not really
fits, but that when he had them if he had a sword he would not
mind cutting everybody's head off. He also believed if anybody
got killed near the place where he worked he would be blamed for
it. Said that when he looks in bright lights he sees visions like
all sorts of different colors, blues, whites, and these seem to
blind him. A diagnosis was made of Dementia Praecox, Paranoid
Type, and he was still in State Hospital after five months.<br>
<br>
In psychopathic personalities, those with deep inferiorities, use
of drugs is a method of supporting the ego. In these cases
Marihuana does not always produce the desirable effect.
Apparently it is not strong enough to affect the problems which
have involved deeper layers of the personality. Such individuals
adopt heroin or morphine very soon after a short experience with
Marihuana. The experience of drug addicts seen at the Court of
General Sessions confirms this. Persons addicted to heroin,
morphine, cocaine or opium never return to Cannabis. Such <br>
individuals are admittedly psychopathic in that they need an
increment of drug to make their lives tolerable, In the next
case, the use of Cannabis represented the attempt of the patient
to overcome his sexual inadequacy. In this respect the social
psychology of the drug is a factor, since Marihuana is popularly
supposed to free sexual inhibitions.<br>
<br>
A white man, age 23, admitted to Bellevue Hospital on March 31,
1938, with a history that he felt unworthy and thought he had a
venereal disease. He held ideas of infidelity against his wife
and was assaultive. Threw a four month old baby across a room. He
turned gas jets on. On <br>
admission he was rambling, talkative, evasive, depressed,
self-absorbed and had somatic complaints. He said: 'I was
sentenced to the Workhouse for 4 months for smoking Marihuana. I
knew then I was not satisfying my wife and I thought it might
help. A year ago some friends gave me the weed, I smoked several.
I felt calm and liked to listen to music - very happy -
exhilarating feeling - that's all.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the hospital he was talkative, discussed his problem in detail
and showed some depression, which improved. The infidelity ideas
and his sexual inadequacies concerned him most. He was
transferred to a state hospital with a diagnosis of Psychosis
with Psychopathic Personality; Cannabis usage a factor.<br>
<br>
Often Cannabis intoxication represents a stage in the incipiency
of a psychosis. The patient who is developing a functional
psychosis strives in the incipient stage to overcome the
unconsciously perceived difficulties. In this sense Marihuana
usage represents a healthy reaction tendency, even though the
mechanism may be unknown to the patient. The next case
illustrated this problem. A boy who had made a successful
adjustment on a moderate level of social attainment began to show
schizoid behavior shortly after the usage of Marihuana. The
process continued to a psychotic state. What role did the drug
play? Could the psychosis have begun without the drug? Was the
use of Cannabis the patient's attempt to cure his developing
psychosis? These are problems needing careful judgment and study
and wide clinical experience.<br>
<br>
A young Negro, 20, admitted October 2, 1936 to Bellevue Hospital
with a history of having been dull, indifferent for some time.
Insisted upon keeping the windows closed, would not leave the
house, but denied he heard voices. Would masturbate openly and
made sign with fingers, and actions were decidedly peculiar.
Mother states she caught him. smoking a sweet-smelling cigarette
with a white man and soon after got a history from his playmates
that he had been smoking Marihuana cigarettes for a long time.<br>
<br>
Observation in the hospital confirmed his withdrawn, retarded
attitude. Psychometric gave an IQ. of 75 with rating of
Borderline to Dull Normal Intelligence. Was pre-occupied on ward;
difficult to obtain his attention; evasive; offered many excuses
for closing window and putting <br>
out lights. About 10 days after admission he appeared a little
more alert and cheerful. He was discharged in custody of mother
as Incipient Schizophrenia (?) or Psychoneurosis, Reactive State,
on October 13, 1936.<br>
</p>

<p>He was readmitted a year later, October 15, 1937. At that time
mother gave a statement that for past year, since he left
hospital, he had been dull, staying in the house in a &quot;deep
study.&quot; He seems to listen; does not say anything'. At one
time he beat up an old man in the house who, he <br>
said, called him names. Prior to admission he had attacked a
woman for no apparent reason. Sleeps day and night. Often looks
as if he is in a dream, Changed personality reactions for more
than a year. For two weeks distinctly worse.<br>
<br>
On admission he was sluggish, dull and lethargic, spoke in a
quiet, low voice, showed empty affect, but was intact in
intellectual functions, memory, comprehension, orientation. He
was transferred to the State Hospital on October 20, 1937, where
he was evasive and dull. He showed no interest in the
surroundings and did not mingle with the other patients. He
expressed mild ideas of persecution and of electricity, was
evasive and suspicious. He said some people called him bad names
across the street. Believes that an attempt was made to harm him.
&quot;I sometimes have a funny feeling in my legs
(electricity).&quot; Their diagnostic impression included the
possibility of Dementias-Praecox, Paranoid Type.<br>
<br>
Gradually he acquired an interest and socialized with other
patients. At all times he was neat and tidy in personal
appearance and habits. He improved after five months and was
ready for parole.<br>
<br>
Now, so much for the psychopathic. We now come to the
criminology. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I thought we would cover that in another
subject.<br>
<br>
We will now adjourn for lunch and come back at 1:30.<br>
<br>
(Thereupon at 12:20 o'clock p.m., a recess was declared, the
conference to resume discussions at 1:30 p.m.)<br>
