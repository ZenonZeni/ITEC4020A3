<CENTER><H2>INTERVIEWING THE SEXUALLY ABUSED CHILD</H2></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><EM>Jones, David, and Mary McQuiston</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>This handbook focuses on the evaluative interview, and is planned as a  guide for those who need to know whether a child has been sexually abused.   The book examines the range of pressures which come to bear on child  victims and reviews recent developments in the field of cognitive  psychology as well as research into memory ability in young children,  their "suggestibility", language, and knowledge of sexuality.  Guidelines  are given on the structure of the interview, and the use of free play,  toys, and play materials is discussed.  The controversial issue of leading  questions is examined.  The final chapter presents a clinical approach to  the question of validation: is the child giving a truthful account?<BR>
