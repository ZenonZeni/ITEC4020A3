<B>Problem/ Opportunity</B>
<P>
Auto shredders generate 3-5 million tons of waste, commonly known as automotive shredder residue (ASR), annually.  The recycling of automotive plastics, which constitute about 20-30% of ASR by weight, is not currently practiced on a commercial basis.  The components are not recycled for several reasons, including a lack of a cost-effective technology for recovering plastics, potential contamination of the plastics with other materials from the ASR stream, and the absence of a strong market.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory is testing a technically promising, potentially economical process to recycle polymers and other constituents from ASR.  The value of the recovered plastics could be very competitive in a variety of applications; one of the first might be polyurethane foam for carpet padding.

</CENTER>
<P>
The Argonne technique for recycling ASR begins with mechanical/physical separation of the ASR into several fractions: polyurethane foam, which is separated and cleaned; iron-oxide-rich "fines," which may be used by the cement industry as a source of iron oxide; and a plastics-rich stream, from which Argonne dissolves and recovers heat-formed plastics (thermoplastics).  The solvent used in the process is regenerated and continuously recycled.  If fines, foam, and plastics are recycled, as much as 75% of landfill waste could be eliminated.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
A demonstration plant at a shredder site is now processing polyurethane foam.  At the same time, four different plastics are being recovered in a batch-process unit, in quantities of 1 to 5 pounds each.  The plastics being recovered for evaluation are acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polypropylene.  Plans are also under way to run a large-scale test using fines in cement.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Some 20,000 pounds of polyurethane foam are being accumulated for an Argonne techno-economic evaluation in early 1995.  Argonne engineers are designing a continuous-process demonstration plant that could produce 3,000 tons of foam per year.  Commercialization of the polyurethane foam process could come as early as the beginning of 1996.
