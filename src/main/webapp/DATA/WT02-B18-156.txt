<B>CYTRX ANNOUNCES SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL
OF REVERSE SPLIT
</B>
<P>
<B>Atlanta, Georgia, February 5, 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
At a Special Meeting of CytRx Corporation,
[NASDAQ: CYTR] shareholders today overwhelmingly approved a one-for-four
reverse split of its common stock shares. 

<P>
With 90% of shares voted, more than 94% of
the ballots cast were in favor of the reverse split.

<P>
“We are gratified by the response of
CytRx shareholders to the reverse split,” commented Jack
J. Luchese, CytRx's President and CEO.  “We strongly
feel this will better position CytRx and our subsidiaries in the
financial markets.”

<P>
The reverse split will be effective on February
6, 1996.  As of that date, CytRx's outstanding shares will
decrease from approximately 31.4 million to 7.9 million.  CytRx
stock will trade under the symbol “CYTRD” for 20
trading days to indicate the new post-split status. CytRx's
transfer agent, American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Co. will send
each shareholder of record a letter of transmittal along with
instructions for exchanging “old” CytRx stock certificates
for  “new”  post-split certificates.

<P>
Luchese continued, “Our stock repurchase
program remains in force, which we will use to take advantage
of price weaknesses should the financial markets not appropriately
value CytRx stock after the reverse split.”   In October,
1995, CytRx's Board authorized the repurchase of up to
5 million shares (1.25 million on a post-split basis).  As of
year-end, the company purchased 235,000 shares (59,000 post-split).


<P>
CytRx Corporation and its subsidiaries are
engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products.  CytRx's
Vaxcel subsidiary is developing the Optivax&#174; vaccine delivery
system.  Vetlife is developing solutions to enhance food animal
growth.  Proceutics provides high quality preclinical development
services to the pharmaceutical industry.
