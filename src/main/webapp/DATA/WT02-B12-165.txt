INS: Management Woes/Enforcement</h2>

<ul>


<p>

INS field managers have accused William S. Slattery, the

third-ranking official in the INS, of improper associations with Korean garment

shop owners.  Slattery allegedly curtailed INS raids on Korean garment

factories in New York in 1993 after he attended social events with factory

owners, including a golf outing and a trip to a sauna, at the invitation of a

Korean-American businessman.<p>

Slattery says that he stopped the inspections of the Koreans garments shops

for 30 days to investigate Koreans' charges that INS agents were discriminating

against them in raiding the factories to look for illegal aliens.<p>

An INS official in New Jersey was convicted in November 1995 on corruption

charges.  In San Diego, a former Immigration and Naturalization Service

Inspector who extorted sexual favors from Mexican women was sentenced to nine

years in prison.<p>

<u>Enforcement</u>.  The INS announced that it was adding agents at the

border to prevent a "post-holiday rush" of illegal immigrants who go home to

Mexico for Christmas and return to the United States after New Year's.  In

early 1996, illegal immigrants with phony papers swamped ports of entry.<p>

In San Diego, a Mexican citizen was indicted for using authentic

immigration documents to smuggle aliens into the US.  According to the

indictment, the documents were purchased on the streets of the US and aliens

wishing to enter the US were matched with the documents on file.  Customers

were solicited and photographed as they arrived at the Tijuana bus station and

then matched with appropriate documents.<p>

In St. Louis, the INS apprehended 29 illegal immigrants from India working

at hotels and doughnut shops.  In Omaha, the INS apprehended 78 illegal

immigrants earning about $6 hourly from Deffenbaugh Industries, the city's

trash hauler; 70 returned voluntarily to Mexico.  An INS agent fired his gun at

a car fleeing the work site, which led Latino advocates to denounce the INS

under the banner "INS behavior is garbage."  The local Mexican American

Commission complained that firing a gun at a car fleeing an INS raid equates

illegal alien employment with bank robbery.<p>

In Georgia, 71 mostly Mexican construction workers working on a new

hospital were apprehended by the INS.  The raid was conducted after

Fayetteville officials complained to the INS that illegal immigrants were

working there.  They were being paid $8 to $15 per hour.  <p>

State police in Colorado tried to turn over to the INS 10 suspected illegal

aliens that it had found in a van headed to Georgia.  But the INS advised the

police that, if the vehicle was in good condition, it should be allowed to

continue to Georgia because no agents, buses, vans or jail space were available

in Colorado to handle the illegal aliens.<p>

Police report that in metropolitan Salt Lake City, 80 percent of those

arrested on drug charges are illegal immigrants.  A Latino theater group in

Salt Lake City performed a play centered on the INS scaring away the

unauthorized shepherds abiding in the field.<p>

Iowa United Methodist Church leaders urged congregations to offer sanctuary

to Hispanics threatened with deportation by the INS.  The church argues that

the INS violates the workers' human rights by staging surprise inspections of

meatpacking plants.  The church says that many of the workers were drawn to

Iowa by company promises of secure work and good wages.  There are 203,000

Methodists in 900 churches in Iowa.<p>

The owner of four Chinese restaurants in Norfolk, Virginia pleaded guilty

to hiring illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America and was sentenced

to probation.  The owner was charged with the lowest offense in the federal

code, a Class 4 misdemeanor, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in

jail.  The owner knowingly hired illegal aliens, paid them with cash and housed

them above the restaurant.  The workers were provided room and board and $600

to $700 a month in cash for working 12-hour days, six or seven days a

week.<p>

In Los Angeles, the INS arrested three suspected smugglers and found 43

illegal immigrants in south central Los Angeles.  The 43 Mexicans had paid $400

to be smuggled through eastern San Diego county and were being held in the safe

house in Los Angeles until friends or relatives made final payments.<p>

A survey of Fresno county business leaders found that 75 percent believe

illegal immigration should be reduced.   <p>

The INS and some US attorneys are searching out and prosecuting criminal

aliens who are deported and later return to the US.  Persons deported from the

US usually sign a deportation warrant that bars a return to the United

States.<p>

17, 1996.  Lynn Waltz, "Restaurants' owner pleads guilty to hiring illegal

workers," Virginian-Pilot, December 14, 1996.  William Simbro, "Methodist

leaders' plea: Give shelter to Hispanics," Des Moines Register, December 13,

1996.  Cindy Gonzalez, "INS Official, Latinos Discuss Shooting," Omaha World
