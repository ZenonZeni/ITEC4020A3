<A NAME="myth"><H3>Myth of the Month</H3><B>
<P>Many gardeners mistakenly believe that leaving clippings on the lawn will cause a problem with thatch. This could not be further from the truth. Here is June's Myth of the Month.</P>
What is Thatch?<BR>
<IMG SRC="THATCH.gif" ALIGN=right>
<P>Thatch is a naturally occurring layer of partially decomposed dead stems and roots that builds up beneath some grasses. High in lignin, these parts of the grass plant are slow to decompose. Some thatch is normal; up to 1/2 inch of thatch is typical for many species of grass and acts almost like a mulch for the lawn. A layer of thatch thicker than 1/2 inch, on the other hand, can mean problems for the lawn.</P>
<P>In severe situations thatch can inhibit the ability of water and nutrients to reach the soil below, and can actually slow the growth of your lawn. It also provides a breeding ground for insects and can harbor diseases harmful to your lawn. In cases where the thatch layer becomes really thick it can also result in the lawn actually growing in the thatch layer on top of the soil. This in turn can make the lawn much more susceptible to dehydration, frost damage, insect attack, and damage from traffic over the lawn.</P>
<P>Most experts have come to agree that the surest way to create a thatch problem in your lawn is to over-fertilize with quick release nitrogen like sulfate of ammonia, a common ingredient of many synthetic lawn foods. Grass clippings do not except under very unusual circumstances contribute to the buildup of thatch. Thatch is caused by the excessive use of soluble fertilizers which cause grass to grow too vigorously, resulting in a buildup of roots and stems that can¹t decompose fast enough. These types of fertilizers can also have a detrimental effect on soil life and can inhibit the very species that would normally help to break down the thatch before it could become a problem.</P>
<P>Other factors that contribute to the formation of thatch include: mowing too short, which keeps the roots close to the surface; frequent light watering which keep only the top of the soil moist and the roots close to the surface; overuse of pesticides and fungicides which suppress soil life like earthworms­an important contributor to the natural control of thatch.</P>
<P>To tell if your lawn has a thatch problem, take a close look at your lawn. As you walk out onto it does it feel spongy and springy? This could be a sign of a thatch problem. Next, stick your finger down into the turf. If you feel soil right away, you have no thatch layer. If instead you feel a spongy layer, take a closer look. Dig a small hole in your lawn (you can replace the sod, just like repairing a divot at the golf course) and take a look at the cross section of the grass. Bring along a ruler. It should be easy to see the soil layer and the grass growing above it. If you see a brown or tan underlying layer of straw-like material between the soil and the grass, measure it. This is the thatch layer. If it is more than half an inch thick, it is time to take action.</P>
<P>To rid your lawn of thatch, follow a few simple guidelines. First, while getting the thatch under control, catch your clippings. (Otherwise, in most cases you should leave fine clippings of less that 1/2 inch to help feed your lawn with valuable nutrients.) Aerate your lawn with a core aerator. After aerating, top dress your lawn with up to 1/4 inch of finely screened compost, like Whitney Farms Peat Humus  or Mushroom Compost. This will help to revitalize your lawn with microorganisms and contribute to the decay of the thatch. Also, using natural fertilizers like Whitney Farms Lawn Food can help to add beneficial organisms to your lawn. Change your mowing practices and your watering habits (see the accompanying article).
In severe cases, it may be necessary to de-thatch your lawn using a thatch rake or a power rake or vertical mower. This is best done in the fall before mid-October and may require over-seeding to help the lawn fill back in.</P>

<A NAME="help"><H3>Help! I need some water!<BR></H3>
<P>For many lawns, particular those grown with cool season varieties of turf grass, the hot days of summer can be particularly stressful.  A number of steps can be taken to ensure that your lawn is ready to withstand the heat and to prepare it for the fall.  Here are some steps recommended by the Turf Resource Center in Rolling Meadows, IL:</P>
<P>Thirty days before the anticipated arrival of hot weather, reduce or eliminate fertilizer.  Fertilizers encourage lush growth that does not withstand the high summer temperatures very well and can increase the amount of water the lawn requires.  Weed killing herbicides can also place the grass under stress that reduces its rate of growth.</P>
<P>Infrequent, deep watering encourages deeper root growth.  Most lawns will need around an inch of water per week, though exactly how much will vary with your soil texture.  Sandy soils will require more frequent watering but will not need as much water each time to ensure a deep watering, while clay soils will require water less often but more water at each application to penetrate more deeply into the soil.
In early fall, a number of steps can be taken to improve the health of your  lawn for the winter and next summer.  Aerating and thatching followed by an application of a slow release fertilizer (like our <A HREF="lawn.htm">Whitney Farms Lawn Food</A>) a couple of weeks later will greatly enhance the performance of your lawn in the coming months.</P>
<P>If you find yourself in an area where severe watering restrictions are enacted during the summer months it does not necessarily mean an end to your lawn.  If you have taken the steps outlined above, allowing your lawn to go dormant (the natural response to extremes of temperature) and turn golden brown is an acceptable solution.  As the heat subsides and the water restrictions are eased, start watering deeply again.  Once the lawn re-establishes its health, you can begin to reduce mowing heights again, and if needed weed control measures can be taken.</P>
