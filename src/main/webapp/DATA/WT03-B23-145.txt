				<I><B><A NAME="whyinvest"><FONT SIZE=+2>Why Invest in Bonds?</FONT></A></B></I>

		<P>
				Investors buy bonds primarily for the following reasons:

		<P><I><STRONG>Income</STRONG></I>
		<P>
				The major attraction is that bonds regularly pay a set amount of interest 
				that is generally higher than that of short-term
				investments such as money market funds, CDs and passbook savings
				accounts. For this reason, investors seeking income, such as retirees,
				will invest a portion of their savings in bonds to help pay their
				living expenses.

		<P>
				Also attractive to some investors are the tax advantages that
				certain types of government and municipal obligations can offer
				to reduce federal, state and/or local taxes. For example, an investor
				in a high tax bracket could place some of his/her assets in municipal
				bonds which will provide income that is exempt from federal taxes
				and perhaps state and/or local taxes. 

		<P><I><STRONG>Long-Term Growth</STRONG></I>
		<P>
				As shown in the chart below, bonds may offer investors an attractive
				way to achieve long-term growth and stay ahead of inflation. Of
				course, past performance is no guarantee of future results.

		<I><STRONG>Safety of Principal</STRONG></I>
		<P>
				Depending on the credit strength of the bond's issuer,
				investors who buy high-quality bonds have a reasonable expectation
				that their principal (the amount of the loan) will be returned
				in full if they hold an individual bond to maturity. Since bonds
				can be of higher quality than other forms of securities, they
				are often used for the preservation and long-term accumulation
				of capital (when interest payments are reinvested). Prior to maturity,
				bond prices in the secondary market will fluctuate with changes
				in market interest rates.

		<P><I><STRONG>Diversification</STRONG></I>
		<P>
				For a vast majority of investors, bonds offer an attractive way
				to balance their investment portfolio that may contain CDs, money
				market funds and stocks. Although bond prices will fluctuate like
				stock prices, high-quality bonds are usually considered lower-risk
				securities.
