President, Drug Watch International </CENTER>
</H3>
America must not be deceived by the voices of despair and doom crying out
for the legalization of drugs. Some say the drug problem is overwhelming,
inevitable, hopeless and that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is lost and the
only solution is to legalize drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Some of these people are national leaders who are making headlines. They
may be well-intentioned but are very misguided, because there is no sound
medical, legal, or social evidence that drug legalization would be a solution
to the drug problem. To the contrary, scientific research, history, and
common sense tells us that if drugs are made easily available, drug use
will increase, drug addiction will increase, and society's problems will
increase. <BR>
<BR>
There are also others who are self-servingly promoting drug use, who are
members of the Washington based Drug Policy Foundation, NORML, and the ACLU,
&quot;children of the 60's:, the so called &quot;intellectuals&quot; of
today. These people, who now wear suits and ties instead of sandals and
beards, are working hard to shape public opinion in the media on recent
television and talk shows, and in popular magazines, and to influence lawmakers
and public policy. Their agenda is the same as it was in the 60's and 70's.
They believe they should have the right to alter their own consciousness
through drug use, ignoring the harm it would do to society in general if
drugs were legal, available and socially acceptable. <BR>
<BR>
I was a teenager in the late 60's, and now as the mother of two teenagers,
for their sake, I do not want to go back to that time when the drug culture
with its pot-heads, psychedelic mind-trips, and depraved lifestyles demoralized
the nation. Society is paying a heavy price for the permissive drug use
of that era, which has left in its wake problems of the homeless, child
abuse, crack babies, the HIV epidemic, loss of productivity on the job,
and crime-ridden communities. Drug legalization now would only deepen the
problem by increasing the number of drugged, addicted individuals on our
streets, on the job, and in our hospitals. <BR>
<BR>
Now is not the time to surrender. Attitudes are changing. Drug use is no
longer considered &quot;chic;&quot; people in public housing are taking
a stand against drug dealing; others are &quot;reclaiming&quot; their neighborhoods
and tearing down crack houses; and statistics show that drug use is down
among young people. <BR>
<BR>
We have a long way to go. We did not get here over night, but we are on
the right track. We must be convinced that a society and an environment
free of the overwhelming problems associated with drug use are once again
attainable. As a nation, we must be committed to providing safe, drug-free
and healthy environments where parents can parent, children can grow, teachers
can teach, and all of us can travel on our streets and live in neighborhoods
with the feeling of security <BR>
<BR>
For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must keep our standards
high. We must never give in and risk the increase in drug use which legalization
would surely bring. <BR>
