		<P>
				As with any investment, there are some risks associated with investing
				in bonds. The degree of risk, however, will vary with the type of debt and the
				issuer. As we discussed in <A HREF="bondfluc.htm">Why Do Bond Prices Fluctuate?</A>,
				there is <I>interest rate risk</I> and the possibility that you
				could lose money if you try to sell a bond before maturity. This possibility
				doesn't mean that you should stash your money under your mattress
				and hide because that also entails a risk of loss. Besides, if
				interest rates were to fall, you could also have a capital gain.
				You can minimize some of your risks by working with a Tucker Anthony
				Investment Executive and implementing some <A HREF="bondstr.htm">Fixed Income Investing 						Strategies</A> such as <A HREF="bondstr.htm#ladder">laddering</A> and matching your bond 						maturities to your investment goals.

		<P>
				Another risk depends on the creditworthiness of the issuer of
				the bond. Is the issuer able to make the scheduled interest payments
				and repay the principal at maturity? Credit risks vary with different
				types of  bonds.  <A HREF="bondust.htm">U.S. Treasury Securities</A> carry
				the least amount of risk and U.S. agency debt has a slightly higher
				amount of risk. Credit risks are usually associated more with
				bonds issued by state and local governments that depend on their
				ability to raise revenues, and with corporate issuers whose credit
				risks are linked to their financial health and earning capacity.
				You can minimize this risk by having a Tucker Anthony Investment
				Executive help you monitor the issuer's credit rating either through
				independent rating services or through fixed income research.

		<P>
				Perhaps the greatest risk to bond holders is the risk of inflation.
				Since bond coupons are generally fixed, the value of the interest
				payments can be affected by inflation. When inflation rises, bond
				prices tend to fall because the purchasing power of the coupon
				payments are reduced. So you can say bonds are not a good hedge
				against inflation. To combat inflation risk, you can invest in
				bonds whose rates of return exceed the anticipated rate of inflation
				or bonds with adjustable interest rates. Don't forget that even
				CDs and Treasury bills are affected by inflation.
