<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Introduction</font>
<P>
	With the introduction of clozapine (Clozaril) in 1990 and then 
risperidone (Risperdal), launched in 1994, we entered a new era in 
the treatment of psychosis.  Olanzapine (Zyprexa), just approved in 
September 1996, and sertindole (Serlect), to be approved soon, add 
to the list of what are known as the "atypical" or "new" 
medications.  Research concerning all of these new medications 
indicates that they may treat a broader range of symptoms than the 
traditional antipsychotic medications and with fewer side effects. 
<P>
 	In all likelihood, there now will be a substantial flurry of 
information about new treatments for schizophrenia.  Clinicians, 
consumers, and families have awaited improved treatments, so there 
will be substantial excitement when these new interventions are all 
available.  
<P>
	We have listed, below, questions we believe are appropriate 
for consumers and their families to discuss with their doctor when 
making decisions about treatment with antipsychotic medication.  
These questions and answers are based on our clinical experience, 
participation in medication studies, and our literature review.  
Note that clinical practice has a legitimate variability, and the 
points made in our discussion are our opinions.  We recognize that 
many consumers are doing well on current standard treatment.  Also, 
the Q & A that follows presumes that consumers, family members, and 
physicians ought to be involved in open, candid, and clinically 
relevant discussions of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">1.  Is the medicine effective?</font>
<P>
	All FDA-approved antipsychotic medications have been through 
rigorous testing and deemed effective, meaning that an 
antipsychotic medication reduces symptoms of psychosis 
statistically better than placebo.  Many of the new medications--
risperidone, olanzapine, and sertindole--have also been compared to 
traditional antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol (Haldol). 
 All three new medicines have shown themselves to be better than 
placebo and at least as good, if not better than, haloperidol.  It 
is appropriate to discuss efficacy with treating psychiatrists.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">2.  What range of symptoms do the antipsychotic medications treat?</font>
<P>
	Over the last four decades, psychiatrists have become 
accustomed to focusing on positive symptoms of psychosis such as 
hallucinations and delusions.  Early studies with the new 
medications indicate the possibility that negative symptoms may be 
improved, too.  Discussing this with your psychiatrist is very 
important.  In addition, the impact of the new medications on 
neuropsychological measures--the ability to maintain sustained 
attention, short-term memory, and decision-making--have been 
studied, so discuss these issues with your prescribing physician 
also.
<P>
	Broadly speaking, the atypical antipsychotic medicines treat a 
broader range of symptoms of schizophrenia than just hallucinations 
and delusions, or positive symptoms.  The atypicals also address 
negative symptoms such as social withdrawal.  A thoughtful 
discussion with your psychiatrist about which of the antipsychotic 
medications can best address your individual symptoms is important.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">3.  What is the risk of movement disorders with an antipsychotic 
medication?</font>
<P>
	Movement-disorder side effects are a frequent consequence of 
the typical or traditional antipsychotics, specifically dystonia 
(muscle spasm);  Parkinsonism (tremor, slow movements); and 
akathisia (restlessness).  Doctors minimize these effects by trying 
low doses of antipsychotics or using medicines to decrease movement 
symptoms.  The "atypical" antipsychotics got their name because 
they can decrease psychosis without causing movement disorders.  In 
our experience, risperidone has few side effects at low doses, but 
can lead to movement-disorder symptoms in higher doses.  Data from 
studies on sertindole and olanzapine indicate very low rates of 
movement side effects.  
<P>
	Epidemiologic studies show that traditional antipsychotic 
medications are associated with tardive dyskinesia (uncontrollable 
muscle spasms resulting in a twisting of the body or neck).  
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) will occur in four percent of patients each 
year that they are exposed to the traditional antipsychotics.  Put 
another way, after seven years of steady treatment with traditional 
antipsychotic medications, a person has a nearly 30 percent chance 
of developing TD.  Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic 
medication, does not lead to tardive dyskinesia.  Ripseridone, the 
first atypical antipsychotic medication for first-line use since 
1994, may be associated with tardive dyskinesia in less that one 
percent of patients per year.  The newest antipsychotic 
medications, olanzapine and sertindole, have probably not been 
tested long enough to make an estimate of their risk for TD; 
however, because they have low rates of Parkinsonism, we expect 
that the risk for tardive dyskinesia will be quite low.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">4.  What about other side effects and how long do they last?</font>
<P>
	Briefly, the traditional antipsychotic medications can lead to 
side effects of sedation, galactorrhea (stimulation of milk 
secretions in females), sexual dysfunction in males, and, rarely, 
liver disorder.  Because the traditional antipsychotic medications 
have movement-disorder side effects, psychiatrists frequently use 
anticholinergic medications such as benztropine (Cogentin) to treat 
them.  These medications may lead to dry mouth, constipation, and 
diminished memory skills.
<P>
	Most people are aware that clozapine is associated with a less 
than one percent chance of agranulocytosis (loss of production of 
white blood cells).  To prevent a serious outcome such as life-
threatening infection, assessment of the white blood count is 
performed weekly for consumers on clozapine.  Clozapine is also 
associated with seizures, sedation, drooling, and increased heart 
rate.  However, when a patient and physician decide that clozapine 
is appropriate for treatment-refractory schizophrenia or 
antipsychotic medication and tolerance, the benefits frequently 
outweigh the risks.
<P>
	After two and one-half years of availability--during which 
time about one million patients have been treated with it--
risperidone has proven to have few non-movement disorder side-
effects; however, it can cause gastric distress and mild sedation. 
<P>
 	The medications just approved or expected to be available in 
late 1996--olanzapine and sertindole--have few movement-disorder 
side effects; nevertheless, they may have non-movement-disorder 
side effects such as sexual dysfunction and minor EKG abnormalities 
with sertindole and possible mild liver dysfunction with 
olanzapine.  As these two medicines are quite new, doctors' 
experience with them is limited.  When a patient talks with a 
physician about the choice of these new medicines, discussing side 
effects is appropriate.  Many side effects, such as sedation, 
improve with time.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">5.  Do I have to take a combination of medicines, and do they 
interact?</font>
<P>
	Your psychiatrist may consider using other medications with an 
antipsychotic medication to treat psychiatric symptoms of 
schizophrenia.  For example, lorazepam (Ativan), an anti-anxiety 
agent, can be used for distress or agitation.  Because it is 
important to treat mood symptoms when they occur with psychosis, 
your psychiatrist may use antidepressants or mood-stabilizing 
agents with an antipsychotic medication.  It is appropriate for the 
consumer and his or her psychiatrist to discuss why an added 
medication is used and what side effects result from the 
combination.  For another example, when the anticonvulsant 
medicine, carbamazepine (Tegretol), is used with a traditional 
antipsychotic medication like haloperidol, the carbamazepine leads 
to increased metabolism of the haloperidol, and there can be 
reemergence of psychotic symptoms.  The new antidepressant 
medications, specifically serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's), 
may diminish the metabolism of other medications and increase their 
blood levels.  Consumers and doctors certainly should review the 
effects of combinations of psychiatric medications.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">6.	What are the dosing and follow-up instructions?</font>
<P>
	Some antipsychotic medications are initially administered at 
the dose that proves most appropriate for a consumer.  As an 
example, haloperidol may be given at 10 mg. per day, and this may 
be the long-term dose for an individual consumer.  For other 
medications, an upward titration can frequently be employed.  In 
our opinion, starting at a somewhat lower dose of risperidone and 
titrating upward as needed has led to symptom reduction while 
diminishing side-effects.  Because of symptoms of hypotension (low 
blood pressure): tachycardia (rapid heart beat); and sedation, 
clozapine is administered in a slowly increasing dosing strategy.  
Consumers and psychiatrists need to communicate about these side-
effects so that titration can be performed appropriately.
<P>
	With new medications, pharmaceutical companies assess the 
results of clinical trials and suggest dosing strategies.  However, 
the initial strategy may change as many thousands of people are 
given a new medication in clinical practice.  For example, the 
dosing strategy for risperidone is generally different now than 
when it was first approved.  Most clinical researchers feel that 
there will be adjustments in dosing strategies with the newly 
released olanzapine and the soon-to-be-released sertindole.  This 
underscores the point that doctors and consumers as well as family 
members need to communicate clearly about dosing and follow-up 
instructions.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">7.	What should a family know?</font>
<P>
	The NAMI movement has stressed psycho-education as a major 
tenant.  Most psychiatrists working with consumers who have 
schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders think it is 
appropriate to openly discuss diagnosis, prognosis, and 
pharmacologic issues with these consumers and their family members. 
 In our opinion, when a consumer and a psychiatrist talk about the 
choice of an antipsychotic medication, family members should be 
included in the discussion so that they are informed about the 
issues described above and that everyone hears the same 
information.  Many clinics have printed medication information 
cards, and it is appropriate to ask your psychiatrist if any are 
available.  We also encourage participation in support groups 
designed for consumers and families so that experiences with 
medications can be shared.
<P>
	In summary, consumers, family members, and psychiatrists are 
excited about the potential for fundamentally new treatments for 
schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.  Although the new 
treatments are a step forward, their safe use does not occur in a 
vacuum.  Meaningful communication about what the medicines can do 
to diminish symptoms, what the side-effects are, and how the 
medicines should be used are crucial for best success.
