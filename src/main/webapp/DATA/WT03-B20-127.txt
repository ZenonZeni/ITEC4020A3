<h2>Energy Awareness--Why Should We Care?</h2><p>
<p>
For the fifteenth year in a row, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has
declared that October is Energy Awareness Month.  So what?  Prices seem
reasonable.  There are no gas lines or fuel shortages.  Why should people

care?<p>

The reason is our children, and their children, and the generations that
follow.  The United States and other nations are making decisions today 
that
will affect the global economy and environment for centuries to come.<p>
In 1860, when Abe Lincoln was running for President, the United States 
was
using the equivalent of 111 million barrels of oil annually.  Today, we 
use
that much oil in less than a week. <p>

Last year, we spent $51 billion on imported oil. Oil imports accounted 
for 44%
of our foreign trade deficit.  By the end of this decade, the amount of 
U.S.
dollars leaking away to oil-producing nations overseas is expected to 
grow to
$94 billion.  Today, we spend almost $500 billion annually in the U.S. to 
light
and heat our homes and offices, run our transportation systems, and 
operate our
farms and factories.  Even modest energy savings can produce new tax-free

disposable income for our families, new capital for our businesses, and 
lower
overhead to make our industries more competitive.<p>

But money is not the only reason we should be aware of energy.  The 
production
and consumption of energy causes more environmental damage than any other

single human activity.  To give just one example; the energy that runs 
our
appliances, furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, and lighting 
produces
two tons of carbon dioxide each year for every man, woman, and child in 
the
United States.<p>

This October, the world stands at a crossroads in regard to energy use 
and, by
extension, the quality of the environment and the quality of life.<p>

During this decade, the United States is expected to spend as much as 
$200
billion on new electric generating capacity.  Worldwide, nations will 
spend an
estimated $1 trillion in the next few years to bring electric power to 
the
billions of people who don't have it.<p>

China and India--the world's two most populous nations--are among the 
many
underdeveloped countries undertaking aggressive economic development 
programs
and planning major investments in energy systems.
<p>
The world investment in energy, with its attendant impact on environment, 
will
keep growing.  Driven by continued population growth and economic 
development,
global energy consumption is expected to increase as much as 50% by the 
year
2010. <p>

The choices we make about where that energy comes from and how it is 
produced
and consumed will affect the world environment for a long, long time to 
come.<p>
That's why DOE established this year's Energy Awareness Month theme as 
"Energy
--Our Future Is Today."  We are indeed deciding our future by the choices 
we make
today.<p>

It's also why DOE is sponsoring a series of town hall meetings around the

country this fall, preparing to write a National Energy Policy Plan for
Congress with "sustainable energy" as its theme. <p>

Sustainable development--meeting the needs of the present without 
compromising
the needs of future generations--is the key to a livable future, and 
energy is
the key to sustainable development.  The United States must lead the 
world in
developing and using energy efficiently, and in making the transition to 
clean,
renewable resources like solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energy.<p>

As Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary puts it, "There has never been a 
greater
opportunity for the United States and other nations around the world to
harmonize the needs of people with the protection of the environment.  If 
we
don't produce and use energy correctly today, we risk damage to our 
environment
tomorrow...The discovery and use of sustainable energy resources advance
economic growth, energy security and environmental health at the same 
time."<p>

As we celebrate Energy Awareness Month, we all can renew our commitment 
to
using energy resources wisely for the generations that will follow.<p>
