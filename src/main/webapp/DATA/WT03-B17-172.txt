PROTOCOLS FOR SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS IN TASK 1<BR>

(Revision date 27 June, 1996)<BR>
by<BR>
Astthor Gislason<P>

Short background:<P>

At the TASC-Task 1 meeting in Trondheim 13-14 April 1996 it was decided that within Task 1 
and Task 2 one should as far as possible try to standardise the methods employed for sampling 
and sample analysis by the different partners.  On that meeting I was asked to collate the different methods protocols for TASK 1 and on the following pages I have assembled these from all 
the partners in Task 1 (i.e. DIFRES, FLL, MLA, MRI, UITØ) and brought them together into 
one document of recommended Task 1 procedures.<P>

At the meeting in Trondheim it became obvious that for practical reasons we should never be 
able to standardise all our methods. Therefore, for many procedures more than one alternative 
for how to proceed is given, while for others I have tried not to be too specific.  For some of the 
more simple things (i.e. net mesh) I do however propose a standardised procedure.  For reasons 
of space I have kept some of the descriptions quite brief.<P>

Even though we will not be able to do all our sampling and sample analysis in exactly the same 
way I feel that it is most important for our partnership that we start off with a reasonable knowledge of each others methods.  That is the purpose of this compilation. Please note that this is 
only a first draft.  All comments, changes and modifications are welcomed. <P>



The protocols are given below:<P>



1. Hydrographic measurements<BR>

1.1 CTD<BR>

Data on temperature and salinity will be collected with a CTD (Sea Bird Electronics SBE-9 or 
Neil Brown).  Calibration is carried out according to standards of the different institutes and 
involves the taking of salinity samples for calibration at each station.  When a CTD is not available, Nansen casts may provide data on temperature and salinity.<P>

1.2 ADCP<BR>

Data on currents will be obtained by either a 150 kHz (UITØ) or a 600 kHz (MLA/DIFRES) 
ADCPs, giving a typical maximum measurement depth of 400 and 80 m respectively. These 
instruments are operated according to protocols of the respective institutes.<P>

2. Nutrient measurements<BR>

Seawater samples (c. 250 ml) for nutrient analysis will be collected from the surface layer, 
quick frozen in plastic bottles and analysed ashore. The measurements will be done according 
to standard techniques (Strickland and Parsons 1968, Grasshoff et al. (eds.) 1983).<P>

3. Measurements of chlorophyll a and primary production<BR>

3.1. <I>In situ</I> fluorescence<BR>

Chlorophyll a fluorescence profiles will be obtained with a in situ fluorometer (Sea Tec or 
similar) fitted on the CTD rosette.  For each cruise the fluorometer is calibrated with extracted 
<i>in situ</I> chlorophyll.<P>

3.2. Chlorophyll a<BR>

Seawater samples (1-2 l) for the measurement of chlorophyll a will be collected from several 
depths in the surface layer and filtered through GF/C (MRI) or GF/F (MLA/DIFRES) glass 
fibre filters (some partners add MgCO3 (MRI, FLL)).  The filters are homogenised in 90% aqueous acetone after which the extract is measured spectrophotometrically.<P>

3.3. Primary production<BR>

At MRI the standard procedure is to measure primary production at light saturation by short 
term (4 hour) Carbon-14 incubations (200-250 uE m-2 s-2) of samples collected at four standard depths (0, 10, 20, 30 m).  At selected stations these measurements may be supplemented 
with incubations at a range of light intensities.  Depth integrated production of the water 
column (mgCm-2 d-1) is calculated according to a modified equation of Steemann-Nielsen 
(1952).<P>

The MLA/DIFRES protocol involves short term (4h) incubations at a range of light intensities 
from which a P/I relationship can be constructed.  Water for incubation is collected by a SEABIRD CTD-Rosette system from at least two depths per station. The rate of primary production (mgCm-2 sea surface) is reconstructed from the vertical distribution of chlorophyll 
(measured by a fluorometer on the CTD), the vertical attenuation coefficient of irradiance 
(measured by a quantum sensor on the CTD), and the relationship between carbon fixation per 
unit chlorophyll and irradiance derived from the incubations.</P>

4. Collecting zooplankton<BR>

4.1. Life sampling<BR>

Live zooplankton will be collected with a WP-2 net (or similar gear) (200-250 um mesh), fitted 
with a nonfiltering cod end (2-8 l).  The net is towed vertically from c. 50 m to the surface with 
a speed of 0.3 m s-1.  On retrieval the contents of the cod-end are gently emptied into a c. 10-20 
l container filled with seawater collected from the surface layer.  The plankton that remain 
attached to the net are considered to be damaged and are therefore discarded.<P>

4.2. Quantitative sampling<BR>

The main emphasis will be on obtaining discrete samples from the different layers of the water 
column.  However, occasionally these will be supplemented with depth integrated samples 
from the whole or a part of the water column.<P>

4.2.1. Depth-integrated sampling<BR>

Depth-integrated samples will be obtained either with a Bongo net or a WP-2 net, both having 
200 um mesh.  These should be equipped with flowmeters to measure the volume of water filtered by the nets. The Bongo nets should be towed obliquely from the surface to the desired 
depth and back to the surface while the ship cruises at c. 2.5 knots. Payout and retrieval rates 
should be c. 10 m min-1. The WP-2 net is towed vertically from the desired depth and up to the 
surface at a speed of c. 45 m min-1.<P>

4.2.2. Depth-stratified sampling<BR>

To obtain depth stratified samples three gears will be used.  These are the Multi Plankton Sampler MPS Type B from Hydro-Bios (MRI), the ARIES (MLA/DIFRES) and the MOCNESS 
(UITØ).  The maximum operation depth of the MPS and the ARIES is 3000 m while that of 
the MOCNESS is 1000 m.  Below follows a brief description of the operation and the main 
specifications of each gear.<P>

Multi Plankton Sampler MPS Type B (MPS) (MRI) The MPS is an opening and closing net 
sampler equipped with five nets of 200 um mesh.  The mouth opening is 0.25 m2 and he 
volume of water filtered by the nets is monitored with mechanical flow meters fitted in each 
net. The MPS is towed by a multiconductor cable and the net changings are controlled with a 
Deck Command Unit from on board the ship.  The instrument is fitted with a pressure sensor 
and the depth is read from the Deck Command Unit.  The MPS can be towed both vertically 
and horizontally, and the towing speed is c. 40 m min-1.  The number of depth strata which will 
be sampled will vary according to bottom depth and hydrographic conditions but we foresee 
that it will be necessary to carry out successive vertical tows at several of the stations.<P>



ARIES (MLA, DIFRES)<BR>

ARIES comprises the following in a single towing vehicle: 1) a LHPR type system, 2) an Optical Plankton Counter, 3) a water sampling rosette, 4) two integrating plankton nets, 5) a CTD 
system.<P>

The system is semi-autonomous, being battery powered and having an onboard computer 
which holds data in RAM during the tow. Thus it does not depend on conducting tow cable. It 
is towed on 16 mm plain steel wire, real time depth being obtained from an acoustic trawl 
headline pressure sensor attached to the sampler (SCANMAR). Ascent and descent rate is controlled by adjusting the ship speed and winch speed to achieve 20 m/min for tows of maximum 
depth >500 m, and 10m/min for shallower tows.<P>

1) Serial net sampler: The LHPR type unit has a single concentrating net (200 um, 30 cm 
mouth diameter) and a series of integrating cod-ends which step past the tail of the net on a 
time interval basis. At the same time, data from a calibrated flowmeter in the mouth of the net 
and a pressure sensor are stored in RAM. Communications with the onboard computer for 
setup and downloading data before and after deployment is by serial cable from a PC. The logged data are merged with navigational data recorded at 60 sec intervals aboard the ship during 
the tow to produce a listing and set of labels for each sample giving the time, lat/long, depth 
and volume filtered for each sample. A typical setup would have flow and pressure data logged 
at 2 sec intervals and sample integration period of 120 sec. Thus, each sample would represent 
a 40 m depth layer in tows deeper than 500 m, or a 20 m layer in shallower tows. The integration period is user selected from a menu system and may be in the range 1-60 minutes. At present, the system allows for a maximum of 110 samples to be collected in a single deployment.<P>

On recovery of the sampler, samples are washed out of the individual cod-ends onto 200 um 
mesh squares, and the whole mesh and sample preserved in 4% borax buffered formaldehyde 
in dram glass vials.<P>

2) Optical Plankton Counter: A standard Focal Technology OPC is mounted near the mouth 
opening of the plankton concentrating net, in clear water flow. The system has been modified 
from that sold commercially to allow self-recording. The data logger integrates the raw data 
coming from the OPC in real time according to user defined parameters of time period and size

class intervals. Typically, the system is configured to integrate particle counts over 120 size 
classes over the range 100-5000 microns, in 60 sec time intervals. As with the net sampler, 
data are stored in RAM by a controlling computer and downloaded to a PC at the end of the 
tow.<P>

3) Rosette system: The ARIES frame also carries a water sampling rosette having 60 bottles of 
200 ml each. The system closes a bottle at the end of every plankton net integration period. In 
a standard deployment, a subsample for nutrient analysis would be taken from each bottle, a 
sample for salinity analysis from the deepest bottle and from one in the upper 50 m, and a sample for chlorophyll analysis from one bottle in the upper 50 m.<P>

4) Integrating plankton nets: Two small mouth aperture integrating plankton nets may be 
attached to the ARIES frame. These are housed in cyclindrical lattice frames which are easily 
removable for washing down. Typically, one net would have 200 um mesh and the other 68 um 
mesh. These simply integrate the plankton over the entire deployment and are included as 
quick overview samples. The intention of the 68 um mesh net is to collect egg and naupliar stages of Calanus for which there are very few data, but which are very important for modelling 
studies.<P>

5) CTD sensors: A self recording SEABIRD SBE9-11 CTD is mounted in the ARIES frame, 
and includes beam attenuation, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence sensors. The 
fluorometer is calibrated from the water samples collected with the ARIES rosette - approx 
200 ml of water from one bottle (known closure depth and time) are filtered through a GFF filter, pigments extracted in 90% acetone, and measured fluorometrically.<P>

A conductivity calibration of the CTD is derived for every cruise from the salinity analyses of 
water samples collected on each ARIES tow. CTD data are processed using the standard routines supplied by SEABIRD Electronics.<P>

MOCNESS (UITØ)<BR>

The Mocness is a multiple opening and closing net sampling system carrying nine nets.  The 
mouth opening is 1 m2 and the mesh size of the nets is 180 um.  Opening and closing of nets is 
activated by commands from a deck unit through a conducting cable.  Vertical hauling speed is 
0.16 m/sec., horizontal speed is 0.6 m/sec, and flow is read with a mechanical flowmeter which 
is calibrated before each cruise.  Depending on bottom depth, sampling will be made in 3-8 
depth intervals.<P>



4.2.3. Sampling eggs and nauplii<BR>

30 l of seawater, sampled from 0.5-3 meters depth is filtered through a 30 um mesh net (FLL).  
The sample is preserved in 4% formalin and in the laboratory ashore the nauplii are staged and 
counted.<P>



5. Treatment of samples<BR>

At completion of a tow all nets should be washed thoroughly so that the samples fall down into 
the corresponding buckets. In the ship's laboratory the samples may then be split with a Motoda splitter in order to have samples for various purposes.  The material obtained by ARIES is 
usually not split.<P>

5.1. Samples for abundance estimation

The fraction intended for species identification, enumeration and the staging of <i>C. finmarchicus </i>is preserved in 4% formalin neutralised with Borax (at UITØ they add the bactericide 1.5-
propane-diol).



5.2. Samples for biomass estimation<BR>

The fraction for obtaining dry weight biomass for both the entire sample and individual animals is frozen (i.e. on pre weighed aluminium dishes) at -20 °C or lower.  The dry weight procedure involves drying the samples for 20 hours at 70°C after which they are weighed on an 
electromicrobalance with high sensitivity (i.e. Mettler AE 240 or Cahn C-31).<P>



5.3. Samples for lipid analysis<BR>

Sampling is best carried out on live haul material, but the catch from for instance ARIES is frequently of sufficiently good quality. Specimens are routinely saved from different depth layers 
from every ARIES deployment. The material is sorted on a cold stage, and 10 animals transferred to cryotubes  which are flushed with nitrogen gas before storage in liquid nitrogen or in a -
80 oC freezer.<P>



5.4. Samples for elemental analysis (CHN) and enzyme analysis<BR>

Animals frozen in liquid nitrogen are used for elemental analysis (CHN) and enzyme analysis 
of selected copepodite stages.<P>



5.5. Samples for genetic analysis<BR>

The following procedure is according to Ann Bucklin: 1. Drain samples for excess seawater 
(over nitex of the same size or smaller as net collection). 2. Place zooplankton in round-sided 
glass bottle and add 95% ethyl alcohol; there must be 3 to 4 times more alcohol than plankton 
by volume; NB. DENATURATION ALCOHOL CAN NOT BE USED FOR SAMPLE 

PRESERVATION. 3. After 24 hours, drain off alcohol and replace with fresh alcohol. 4. 
Ensure frequent curation after the cruise and for the duration of storage to avoid evaporation or 
decomposition of the sample.<P>

6. Taxonomic analysis of preserved zooplankton<BR>

Complete faunal analysis: Initially gelatinous zooplankton are removed from the samples and 
their displacement volume measured.  The larger animals (euphausiids, amphipods, caridea 
and fish larvae) are then removed and counted from whole samples.  Except when the sample 
is very small the remainder is then split a number of times with a Motoda splitter and an aliquot containing at least 500 individuals analysed for species or higher taxonomic groups.  
Further, from each sample at least 200 individuals of C. finmarchicus are classed to developmental stages.<P>

Analysis limited to Calanus spp. plus perhaps a few other key species (e.g. Sagitta, Oithona) 
(MLA, DIFRES).  The following applies to the analysis of ARIES samples.  The aim is to 
identify and stage a maximum of 400 Calanus specimens per sample. Subsampling is only carried out if the sample contains >400 specimens (most individual ARIES samples are relatively 
small, but there are very many of them).  Both C.finmarchicus and C.helgolandicus are commonly present in samples from the North Sea and the southern Norwegian Sea. No attempt is 
made to discriminate the two on a routine basis for stage V or below, nor for stage VI males. 
BEFORE any subsampling is performed, 20 stage VI female Calanus are removed and examined to discriminate C.finmarchicus and C.helgolandicus. These specimens are then replaced in 
the sample. Other Calanus species found on a reasonably regular basis are C.hyperboreus and 
C. tenuicornis.  Subsampling is performed by making the sample up to 200 ml in a cylinder 
and removing 4x5ml with a Stempel pipette.<P>



7. Determining egg production rate<BR>

The catch from a life tow is gently diluted and transferred into c. 10- 20 l plastic bucket.  From 
this bucket samples are immediately taken with a large pipette and transferred to Petri dishes 
where females in good condition are sorted out using a stereomicroscope with cold stage and a 
pipette.  The females are then placed into egg production chambers or glass bottles pre-filled 
with sieved surface water (50 um). One female (FLL: two) is added to each chamber/bottle and 
if possible 10 replicates should be done per station.<P>



The egg production chambers (MRI, FLL) are of perspex and have a volume of approximately 
0.6-1 l with a 300-500 um mesh near the bottom separating adult females from the eggs to 
reduce cannibalism (Steve Hay's set-up). For incubation the chambers are placed into a container situated in a shaded area on deck and with flowing surface water.  Incubation time is 24

hours.  A black plastic sheet may be placed over the container to prevent excessive light from 
entering.  Incubations are carried out at ambient sea temperatures.<P>



The glass bottles (MLA, DIFRES) have a volume of 0.5-1 l.  The incubations are carried out in 
a constant temperature room at approximately the ambient surface water temperature. Illumination is periodic, with a daylength 1 hour shorter that at the time of year of the cruise, with 
dim light only during the light period. The bottles are not agitated during the incubations, but 
placed upright in plastic boxes<P>



Incubations are terminated after 24 hours by filtering onto a 20 um screen on which the eggs 
are counted immediately under a stereomicroscope. The eggs show up clearly on the dry 20 um 
screen. The incubated female is measured (cephalothorax length) and preserved in 4 % formaldehyde. Fecundity is expressed as the number of eggs produced per hour and day<P>



8. Measurement of gut fluorescence<BR>

The cod-end contents from a live tow are gently rinsed on 200 um sieve with filtered seawater 
(1 um) to remove debris and any cells that may adhere to the animals.  In doing this care is 
taken to keep the sieve submerged at all times.  The sample is then placed in a Petri dish (MRI) 
or a cryotube (MLA, DIFRES), wrapped in aluminium foil, and frozen immediately

(-20°C or lower).  Further analysis is made in the laboratory on land within one month of collection.<P>



If gut evacuation experiments are to be carried out only a subsample is frozen (t=0 min).  The 
rest of the sample is then transferred gently to a 50 l container filled with filtered seawater.  The 
container is placed in a water bath with approximately the ambient temperature from which the 
animals were collected.  Subsequent subsampling from the container takes place at 5, 10, 15, 
20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 240 minutes after collection.  To obtain a value on background fluorescence a final sample is taken after 24 hours.<P>



In the laboratory on land a portion of the contents of the Petri dish is allowed to thaw for 5-10 
minutes in the dark.  Ten individuals of C. finmarchicus are then pickled out under dim light 
and placed in small test tubes with 5 ml of 90% acetone (at least 5 replicates).  The tubes are 
then capped and left for 10-20 hours in a refrigerator for extraction (MLA/DIFRES: 1.0-1.5 
hours).  As to if the samples are homogenised there are different procedures among the partners.  MRI do not homogenise the samples while MLA/DIFRES do homogenise with ultrasound.  According to Simrad et al. (1985), Kleppel et al. (1988) and Morales et al. (1990) this 
is however not necessary.  The fluorescence of the extract is measured before and after acidification with 10% HCl in a Turner Designs Model 10 Fluorometer, which is calibrated with pure 
chlorophyll a (MRI: Product number C5753 from Sigma Chemical Company).  Gut pigment 
content is calculated using the modified formulas of Strickland and Parsons (1968) for in vitro 
fluorometry, adjusted for volume acetone and number of animals used in the extraction.  The 
results are expressed as total gut pigment content (chlorophyll a equivalent), i.e. the sum of 
chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations in the gut.  Ingestion rates are calculated 
according to the formula I = S R, where S is the mean gut pigment (ng chlorophyll a equivalents ind-1) and R is the gut evacuation rate constant(time-1) as estimated from the gut evacu-
ation experiments.<P>
