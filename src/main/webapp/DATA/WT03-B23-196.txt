Process</B></FONT></FONT>
<P>The ultimate objective for anybody who has been injured in an automobile
accident is to obtain reasonable financial compensation.  Often that can
be achieved through settlement negotiations and without the need for filing
a lawsuit.  We generally recommend exploring settlement opportunities before
going to court.
<P>However, a lawsuit may be your only legal remedy if you are unable to
obtain an acceptable settlement.  Sometimes there is a question of
<A HREF="neg.htm">who was at fault</A> in an auto accident, or sometimes
there is simply a difference of opinion between the injured person and the
insurance company for the responsible driver regarding the
<A HREF="howmuch.htm">settlement value of a claim.</A>
<P>In these cases, it is important to have the help of an experienced attorney
in the litigation process.
<H3>How long can I wait to start a lawsuit?
</H3><P>Every state has its own "<A HREF="sol.htm">statute of limitations</A>,"
 which is the legal time limit for filing a lawsuit after the date of the
accident.  The length of time ranges from one year (California, Kentucky,
Louisiana and Tennessee) to six years (Maine and North Dakota).
<P> In addition, sometimes there are very short notice requirements, such
as when a claim may be made against a State, City or County.  In such cases,
it may be necessary to file a formal Notice of Claim in as little time as
30-60 days after a motor vehicle accident.  Therefore, it is essential that
anybody with an auto accident claim seek legal advice as to the statute of
limitations and notice requirements that will apply in their case.
 <STRONG>Waiting too long can mean losing all your rights to ever make a
claim for your injuries.</STRONG>
<H3>Do I have to have an attorney to file a lawsuit?
</H3><P>No, an <A HREF="needatty.htm">attorney</A> is not required.  There
are, however, a number of things that you must consider if you decide to
represent yourself.  You need to be certain that you have named all possible
defendants, and that you have included all possible causes of action.  For
example, in addition to the driver of the vehicle that injured you, there
may be a claim against the driver's business, or the owner of the car, or
a tavern where the driver had been drinking.  If you do not include all your
claims, they may be lost forever.
<P>In addition, you can be certain that, if the defendant had insurance,
the insurance company will hire an experienced attorney to oppose your lawsuit,
and that can make it very difficult to navigate the complex litigation process
on your own.  It is also hard for someone not experienced in these matters
to decide when it is appropriate to settle and for how much.
<H3>If I start a lawsuit, does it mean that the case will go to trial?
</H3><P>Not necessarily.  The majority of cases can still be settled, even
after a lawsuit is begun.  Statistically, fewer than one in five cases in
which a lawsuit is filed actually goes to court for a full trial.  The rest
are settled at some point along the way.
<H3>What other methods are available to resolve this claim without going
to court?
</H3><P>Many jurisdictions now provide for arbitration or mediation, and
other non-court types of resolution procedures.  These are referred to as
<A HREF="adr.htm">alternative dispute resolution</A> options.  The use of
these options is expanding rapidly to attempt to reduce some of the pressure
on the court system.
<H3 align=center>THE EARLY STAGES OF A LAWSUIT
</H3><H3>Filing the Complaint
</H3><P>A lawsuit is initiated by the filing of a document called a "complaint"
in the appropriate court.   The injured person is called the "plaintiff,"
and the plaintiff, or the plaintiff's attorney, files the complaint.  The
defendant is the person who caused the accident; note that the suit is usually
<B>not</B> against the insurance company.  The lawsuit is usually filed in
the county where the accident occurred, or where the defendant lives.  There
will be a fee paid at the time the complaint is filed, often in the $100
to $200 range.
<P>The complaint will be in the form required by the particular court and
will generally set forth the following:
<UL><LI>Time, date and location of accident
<LI>Description of the accident
<LI>Name of all defendants who were at <A HREF="neg.htm">fault</A>
<LI>Nature of the plaintiff's injuries
<LI>Amount of plaintiff's <A HREF="medwage.htm">medical bills</A>
<LI>Amount of plaintiff's <A HREF="document.htm">wage loss</A>
<LI>Amount sought by plaintiff for "<A HREF="howmuch.htm">general damages</A>"
(for "pain and suffering")
</UL><H3>Service of the Complaint
</H3><P>At the time the complaint is filed, a case number is issued.  A
<EM>summons</EM> is then prepared and personally delivered to each defendant
along with a copy of the complaint.  This procedure is called
<EM>service</EM> of the lawsuit. The summons will include the case number,
name  the plaintiff and each defendant, and direct the defendant to file
a formal response (usually a document called an "answer") with the proper
court within a specific length of time.  The law usually allows between 20
and 30 days for a defendant to respond from the date the summons and complaint
are served.
<P>If the defendant has no insurance, he/she should turn the complaint over
to an attorney.  If there is insurance, then the insurance company should
get a copy, and they will hire an attorney.  The attorney will then file
the appropriate response with the court.  If nothing is filed within the
required time, plaintiff may take a "default" against the defendant and could
end up obtaining a judgment.
<H3>Filing the Answer
</H3><P>The answer may contain one or more the following:
<UL><LI>A general denial of the claim
<LI>Admissions that some of the allegations in the complaint are true, but
others are not (for example, a defendant might admit that he hit the plaintiff's
car, but deny that the plaintiff was injured)
<LI>An "affirmative defense," such as a claim that plaintiff was also at
<A HREF="neg.htm">fault</A> in causing the accident or that the statute of
limitations had run before the complaint was filed
<LI>A "counterclaim," which is a claim back against the plaintiff
<LI>A "cross claim," which is a claim against another defendant
<LI>A "third party claim," which is a claim against another person or company
who was not originally named in the lawsuit
</UL><H3 align=center>THE MIDDLE STAGES OF A LAWSUIT - DISCOVERY
</H3><P><EM>Discovery</EM> is the process by which each side finds out much
of the information the other side has.  It is a formal investigation wherein
each side gathers evidence to prepare its case.  The days of "trial by ambush,"
in which neither side knows what the other is going to do until trial actually
begins, are largely over.  Now, both sides have fairly broad access to
information to prepare their cases.
<P>The process of discovery is governed by local rules of court procedure,
and every jurisdiction is different.  Interrogatories may be exchanged by
the parties in the dispute in order to find out the facts.  Depositions may
be taken. Doctors and witnesses may be interviewed. Medical records and wage
loss verification may be requested through the use of procedures such as
"requests for production."  Furthermore, the defendant may ask that the plaintiff
be examined by a doctor defendant chooses.
<P>The reason for discovery is to get to the truth by making sure that both
side have all the information regarding the accident and resulting injuries.
Many times settlement of the claim is possible after the discovery process
is complete, since it forces everyone to try to accurately evaluate the strengths
and weaknesses of their case.
<H3>Depositions
</H3><P>The law may allow the testimony  (<A HREF="depo.htm">deposition</A>)
of the parties and witnesses to be taken before the trial. In a deposition,
the plaintiff, defendant, doctor or other witness is sworn to tell the truth,
and questions are then asked by the attorneys in the presence of a court
reporter who takes down all of the testimony. Your attorney will be present
at all times during a deposition. What is said at a deposition can later
be used at the trial.
<H3>Interrogatories
</H3><P>Interrogatories are written questions that each attorney may prepare
and give to the other side to be answered under oath.  The answers are considered
sworn testimony, just as if given during a trial.  Not every jurisdiction
permits the use of interrogatories.
<H3>Requests for Production
</H3><P>Each lawyer will probably serve requests for production of documents
on the other lawyer.  These requests compel the other side to provide documents,
such as medical records or photographs.
<H3>Independent Medical Examinations
</H3><P>The insurance company for the defendant may request that a plaintiff
be examined by a doctor chosen by the insurance company. This is called an
Independent Medical Examination or IME.  The court will usually require that
a plaintiff attend this exam.  If the case goes to trial, the IME doctor
can come in and testify about his or her findings in the exam.
<H3 align=center>THE LAST STAGE - TRIAL
</H3><H3>Trial Date
</H3><P>At some point a trial date will be assigned.  This means that your
case will be placed on the court calendar. The court calendar is a list of
dates on which cases which are ready for trial will be heard. The date of
trial may be several months away, or even a year or two away, depending on
what county (jurisdiction) your case was filed in.
<P>Each jurisdiction is different about when they assign trial dates, and
how long it takes to get to trial.  You could wait as little as six months
from the time your complaint is filed to actually begin trial of your case,
to as long as five years in some large urban areas.  Even though a trial
date is received, it is common that set-overs be requested.  They can be
requested by either side.  Typically the reasons are that discovery is not
completed, or one of the attorneys or a party has a conflict with another
matter.
<H3>Settlement Conferences
</H3><P>Frequently one of the parties will request a settlement conference
prior to trial.  In some jurisdictions, such conferences are mandatory; the
court wants to make sure a good effort has been made to settle the case before
committing the court's resources to a trial.
<P>At the settlement conference, a judge will meet with the parties and their
attorneys to try to reach a settlement.  It will usually not be the same
judge who would preside over the trial if the case does not settle.
<P>The judge will often take an active role in trying to get the two sides
to reach a negotiated settlement. He/she may suggest possible compromises
by actually placing a dollar value on the case and encouraging a plaintiff
 to accept a settlement offer.  Conversely, the settlement judge may also
seek to encourage an insurance company to offer more money in settlement.
 The approach will be based on the particular facts and the judge's experience
in presiding over jury trials in that jurisdiction.
<P>If settlement is not reached at this time, the case will usually go to
trial.
<H3>Trial Procedure in a Nutshell
</H3><H4>Jury Selection
</H4><P>Although it is not required, most personal injury cases are tried
to a jury.  In a jury case, the first step is to  obtain a jury  that can
be fair and impartial.  Traditionally, juries are made up of twelve individuals,
although many courts use six jurors.  Jurors are selected at random from
the community using public records such as voter registration or drivers
license information.
<P>After a jury "panel" of perhaps 20 potential jurors  has been sent to
the courtroom from a waiting area, the first step is to question prospective
jurors to determine whether they can be fair and impartial. The  judge and
the attorneys on each side have the right to question jurors and may ask
that a juror  be excused "for cause" if the juror  is biased or otherwise
indicates he/she cannot fairly decide the case.
<P>In addition, each side has certain "peremptory challenges" which permit
them to excuse a limited number of jurors without giving a reason.
<H4>Opening Statements
</H4><P>After selection of the jury, each attorney has the opportunity to
make an opening statement to the jury. This statement describes what the
case is about, gives a preview of what evidence will be presented, and basically
outlines the nature of the argument for the jury.
<P>The trial begins by plaintiff's attorney addressing the jury.  Next, an
opening statement is generally made by defendant's attorney, although the
defense attorney is permitted to waive his opening statement and wait until
the plaintiff's case is completed before addressing the jury.
<H4>Presentation of Evidence
</H4><P>The presentation of evidence begins after the opening statements.
 Plaintiff's attorney will present evidence first, followed by the defense.
 Evidence consists of the testimony of witnesses and exhibits which the court
allows into evidence.
<P>All evidence must be legally admissible. Complex rules of evidence govern
what is legally admissible, and disputes between the attorneys are resolved
by the trial judge.  These evidentiary rulings are important because they
help determine what the jury will consider in arriving at their verdict,
and errors by the judge in his or her ruling on evidence questions may provide
the basis for a later appeal of the verdict.
<P>There are two types of evidence which can be presented. <EM>Testimony</EM>
is oral evidence on any relevant matter given by a witness who is under oath.
<EM>Physical evidence</EM> includes all other types of evidence such as medical
records,  x-rays, tax returns, and photographs which the trial judge allows
the jury to consider.
<P>In order to support their position, each side calls witnesses to testify.
They may be either " lay" or "expert" witnesses. A <EM>lay witness</EM> may
have knowledge of relevant facts, such as an eyewitness to an accident or
 a spouse who  testifies to plaintiff's physical limitations from the accident.
 A witness who has knowledge or special training not generally known by the
general public would be considered an <EM>expert witness</EM>. For example,
a physician would be considered an expert witness because of his medical
knowledge.
<P>After the plaintiff's case has been presented, the defense has the right
to make a motion (a request) to the judge to dismiss the case on the basis
that a case has not been sufficiently established. This would be based on
defense's contention that plaintiff has not shown enough evidence to support
the claim.
<P>Plaintiff has the <EM>burden of proof</EM>.  This means that a plaintiff
must provide evidence to support each and every claim he or she is making.
By making the motion to dismiss, defendant is asking the judge to rule that
there has been insufficient evidence presented and that,  as a matter of
law, the jury could not rule in the plaintiff's favor. If the judge rules
that the plaintiff has not met the minimum requirement of proof, the judge
will grant the motion to dismiss the case. If the judge decides that enough
evidence has been presented, defendant's motion will be denied and the trial
will continue.
<P>Next up is the defendant's attorney, who will introduce testimony from
witnesses and other evidence, the object of which is to disprove the claims
presented by the plaintiff. When this process is completed, that is, when
all the defendant's evidence has been introduced, the defendant's attorney
will rest his case.
<P>At this point, the plaintiff has the right to bring in rebuttal witnesses.
 The purpose of these witnesses is only to refute specific evidence introduced
by the defendant.
<H4>Closing Argument
</H4><P>After both sides rest their cases, each is permitted to address the
jury in a closing argument or summation. This is a final attempt to influence
the jury's verdict by reviewing the evidence and by using the art of persuasion.
In most states, the plaintiff argues first, then the defendant argues, and
then the plaintiff offers a rebuttal.
<H4>Jury Instructions
</H4><P>After the summations (or sometimes before them) the judge will instruct
the jury - that is, the judge will inform the jury of the law applicable
in the case and how to apply the facts in the to that law to arrive at a
verdict. The attorneys for both sides usually propose jury instructions and
argue to the judge, without the jury present, about what instructions should
be given to the jury before the jury is charged. Errors in jury instructions
can result in a case being overturned on appeal and retried, so the attorneys
and judge are usually very thorough about the language of jury instructions.
<H4>Verdict
</H4><P>After the members of the jury have heard the evidence, heard the
arguments of the attorneys, and been instructed as to the law of the case,
it is left up to them to reach a verdict.  They will decide if the defendant
was at fault in causing the motor vehicle accident and, if so, how much money
the plaintiff is be awarded in compensation.
<P>The jury retires to a jury room, where the case is discussed. A presiding
juror, sometimes called a "foreman," is selected to guide  the jury
deliberations, but does not have any greater vote than any of the other jurors.
<P>In some jurisdictions a unanimous decision is required for a verdict in
a civil case involving personal injuries. In others, the decision need not
be unanimous. For instance, a five-to-one vote may be a legal verdict on
a six-person jury, and a ten-to-two (or sometimes nine-to-three) vote on
a twelve person jury.
<H4>Some Notes on Courtroom Conduct
</H4><P>During a trial, the same items listed above under how to conduct
yourself during a <A HREF="depo.htm">deposition</A> apply to your presence
in court. Most important is behaving in a respectful manner to everyone and
answer questions truthfully. The following are additional tips:
<OL><LI>Be in court and attend every day of the trial. If you do not, the
jury may your absence as uncaring about your case.
<LI>Do not be late for court.
<LI>Be polite, courteous and dress appropriately at all times.  The jurors
are watching you!
<LI>Do not attempt to communicate in any way with your attorney or anyone
else while testimony is being given or when the court is being addressed
by your attorney.
<LI>Do not argue with your attorney or anyone else in the view of the jury
or judge. Take notes during the proceedings so that you can bring up any
concerns later to your attorney.
<LI>During your testimony, if your attorney objects to a question asked of
you, do not answer until the judge instructs you to answer.
<LI>Do not attempt to communicate with any juror at any time.
<LI>Be sure you speak clearly and speak loud enough to be heard.
</OL><H3 align=center>APPEAL
</H3><P>If the verdict of the jury goes against you, you may have the right
to an appeal to a higher court. This is true whether you are the plaintiff
or the defendant. In order to appeal, there must be an error of <EM>law</EM>
by the judge.  This may be a ruling on evidence questions, or motions, or
jury instructions.  However, it is important to remember that in general
you cannot appeal the findings of <EM>fact</EM> made by a jury.
<P>Appellate procedures differ considerably between jurisdictions.  In general,
it is a process by which legal arguments are made in written documents called
briefs, then argued orally before the appropriate appellate court.  The appeal
is not a place to present witnesses or evidence; the appeals court reviews
only the <EM>record</EM> made at trial.  The record consists of the evidence,
the exhibits, and any other proceedings taken down by the court reporter.
