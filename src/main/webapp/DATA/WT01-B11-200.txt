<B>MNR Congratulates Winner of the 1995 Greg Clark Award
</B>

</CENTER><P>

Rick Charles is the winner of the 19th annual Greg Clark Outdoor Writing Award sponsored by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.<P>

Mr. Charles won the award for an article on lake trout entitled "Save the Lakers", which was published in the Fishing 1995 edition of  Outdoor Canada magazine.<P>

"I congratulate Mr. Charles on winning this award and I commend him on his choice of subject," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "It is important for us to find ways to protect the province's trout populations.  Through the activities of anglers and fish and game clubs, and the use of proper angling and live-release techniques,  I am confident we can preserve trout populations in Ontario."<P>

The Greg Clark Outdoor Writing Award commemorates the late Greg Clark, a prominent conservationist and outdoor writer whose career as a reporter, columnist, humorist and story-teller spanned almost 60 years.  The competition was administered by the Canadian Science Writers' Association.<P>  

The article detailed the importance of lake trout as both a national fish, and as a popular fish in Ontario.  It also informed readers about the considerable interest this species has generated in the angling community and how it is valued from both an ecological and economic standpoint.  
Mr. Charles describes the concerns over declining lake trout populations in Ontario, and explains how the Ministry of Natural Resources and some U.S. states are looking into ways of sustaining the trout population.<P>	

"I am especially honored to receive the Greg Clark award," said Mr. Charles. "Mr. Clark has been an idol of mine for many years, and his writing has been an inspiration to me as I am sure it is to many writers.  I am currently working on a series of short stories.  As I write, I try to keep the spirit of Greg Clark alive by adopting his approach to outdoors storytelling, humour and reflections on life," he added.<P>

Mr. Charles works as a full-time freelance writer.  He spent most of his professional career in Toronto as an on-air broadcaster and news director as well as a national anchor for Broadcast News and Canadian Press.  He has also taught broadcasting at Humber College in Etobicoke. <P>
