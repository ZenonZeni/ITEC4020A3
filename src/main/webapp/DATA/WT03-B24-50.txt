Before the beginning of each semester, the ISSE department holds an orientation
meeting to advise newly admitted and continuing students.  <EM>Incoming students are
required to attend the orientation meeting.</EM>  Registration forms are signed at
this time; however, students may register ahead of the orientation meeting by
coming to the department for prior approval of classes.
<P>
The department also provides an advising function to students, as outlined in the
Student Advising Form available from the department.  Each student is assigned
a faculty adviser with whom the student may confer on matters related to degree
requirements.  A Plan of Study form for the MSIS degree should be completed and
submitted by the student soon after admission to the program.  The plan serves
as a planning guide for the student.
