<h3>FOCUS - SEX IN CYBERSPACE?</h3>
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> The debate over sex on the  Internet  is next
tonight. The Senate has passed a bill that would ban pornography in
cyberspace. But yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Newt Gingrich, said the ban is a bad idea.
<p>
<b>REP. NEWT GINGRICH, Speaker of the House: [last night]</b> Clearly a
violation of free speech and it's a violation of the right of adults to
communicate with each other, but was I think seen as a good press
release back home so people voted for it.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> The Speaker was referring to a provision in the
sweeping Telecommunications Reform Act passed by the Senate last week.
Its sponsor, Senator  James  Exon,  said it would protect children from
one of the pot holes on the information highway.
 <p>                                                                         
<b>SEN. JAMES  EXON,  [D] Nebraska:</b> I had a remarkable demonstration of
what is readily available to any child with the basic  Internet  access.
It is not an exaggeration to say that the worst, most vile, most
perverse pornography is only a few "click, click, clicks" away from any
child on the  Internet.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> The  Internet  is a global network of smaller
computer networks. An estimated 25 million people are plugged into the 
Internet,  and the number has been doubling every year. Until recently,
access was only available through powerful computers at universities and
government research facilities. But now, dozens of companies offer
access to anyone with a home computer and a modem connected to a phone
line. With that access, users can send E-Mail messages to other users or
search the  Internet  for whatever interests them, the latest satellite
photos from NASA, digitized collections of fine art, information on a
favorite rock band, or the latest medical information on any given
disease or treatment. And along with all the art and science has come
pornography and chat rooms, where people can send messages on any number
of subjects, including sexually explicit ones, to other  Internet 
users. Since the Internet  is a network of users, nobody owns it, nobody
runs it, and up until recently, nobody tried to police it.
<p>
<b>REP. NEWT GINGRICH:</b> I don't agree with it, and I don't think it's a
serious way to discuss a serious issue, which is: How do you maintain
right of free speech for adults while also protecting children in a
medium which is available to both?
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b>The Senate's answer is a bill that would make it a
crime to send obscene or harassing messages on the  Internet.  It would
also impose a $100,000 fine and a two-year prison term on anyone who
made indecent sexual material available to under-age  Internet  users.
Should there be restrictions on the  Internet?  We have two views: Sen.
James  Exon,  Democrat from Nebraska, and Jerry Berman, the executive
director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit civil
liberties organization based in Washington. Thank you, gentlemen, for
being with us. Sen.  Exon,  let's start with you. I know you can't be
terribly specific on a show like this, but what did you see on the
Internet  that made you want to enact this bill?
<p>
<b>SEN. JAMES  EXON,  [D] Nebraska:</b> [Capitol Hill] Elizabeth, I saw the
opening of your show. If we could show on your program tonight what's
readily available most unfortunately to children on the  Internet,  I
had a book that was downloaded with pictures that I showed to many of my
colleagues in the United States Senate, they did not know this was
available. It's pornography at its worst. It's obscenity at its worst.
And to say it's indecent is an understatement. I wish I could show the
pictures, but you couldn't, and I wouldn't. I simply say the  Exon-Coats
Bill that passed the United States Senate 86 to 14 is a step in the
right direction. It's not a cure-all, but it will provide a deterrent to
stop the profiteering that's going on today that are polluting the minds
of our youth. We can't just sit idly by and say, oh, this is so
complicated we can't do anything about it. I believe maybe -- although
not very many people can tell Newt Gingrich anything these days -- even
I might be able to convince Newt, as I did many others, that sitting
idly by and letting this happen on the  Internet  today is going to have
a serious deterrent to other people getting on the  Internet  to take
advantage of that vast new system to spread knowledge that I'm excited
about. We've got to do something to protect the kids.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b>  Senator,  the Speaker says it's a violation of free
speech. Isn't it?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  It's not a violation of free speech, and I called on a
lot of well-known lawyers to make sure that this bill could test -- to
be properly tested on the constitutional rights provision. We never know
what the courts are going to do. We based this on the law that has been
in effect and been approved constitutional with regard to pornography on
the telephones and pornography in the U.S. mail. We're not out in
no-man's land. We're running on the record of courts' decisions that
have said you can use community standards to protect especially kids on
telephones and in the mails. We're trying to expand that as   best we
can to the  Internet.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Mr. Berman, I surfed the  Internet  a little bit
today to see what I could find on it, and I also can't say exactly what
I found on this show, but one of the things I found was a solicitation
for pictures of eight to eleven year old girls having sex with adult
men. What, if anything, should be done about this?
<p>
<b>JERRY BERMAN, Center for Democracy and Technology:</b> First of all, they
ought to be rounded up and prosecuted. The Justice Department is out
there. It has a, a whole division that works on computer crime
prosecution. It should be pointed out that the Justice Department did
not ask for new legislation in this area. They are prosecuting under
current law. Child pornography, bestiality, the most perverse things
that Sen.  Exon  talks about, are violations of the criminal law. What
he fails to point out is that his statute went much broader than that
and would ban the knowing, making available any materials which may be
indecent to anyone under the age of 18. That not only covers pornography
and obscenity, which we all abhor, but it also would cover the
communications between adults where they might be talking about
"Ulysses" or talking about rap music or having a discussion about, about
their sexual preferences. The problem with the Internet,  unlike the
U.S. mails and the telephone system, is that it's not a closed system.
It's not just two people communicating with each other through    a
closed envelope or a closed telephone line. Here, when you communicate
on the Internet,  you make information available, you put it up, and you
put it up and anyone can come and get it. And it's important in this
technology to understand that you have to come and get it. I understand
it may be a few clicks away but you have to come and get it. And that
makes it very different because you know, just simply know that there
are children on the  Internet,  and, therefore, any information that
maybe we would try to communicate between adults could get in the hands
of a child and, therefore, it's a crime. So the only way to clean up the
Internet  is to make it safe only for children.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> What about that problem, Sen.  Exon?  Let's say
there's a discussion among adults about James Joyce's "Ulysses," which
might be considered indecent, and a sixteen-year-old logs on. Won't that
be against the law under your bill?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  I think Jerry tries to make a case, it's a false case.
Certainly, it would have to be prosecuted by a prosecutor, and the judge
would have to so decide that watching that type of a program that I do
not think under the definition that anyone considers would be
pornographic. That's one of the problems we have with people like Jerry.
They may be well intentioned, but they just don't seem to realize that
we can't sit back and see what you saw on the Internet  today and what
kids are seeing all over. The facts of the matter are that there is
not enough prosecution taking place today.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> But the --
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  The Coats-Exon  Bill will assist in stopping this, but
it won't be a cure-all.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> What about what Mr. Berman said, though, the worry
that only that which is good for kids or which kids can look at will be
on the Internet if, if this bill passes?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  Well, that's obviously not true. The -- we have --
hardly have a day goes by that what we don't have some case of a kid
being lured away from home, taken advantage of. What you saw today is
replete on the  Internet.  There will be a study coming out very soon
that's going to be widely distributed next week that proves the case
once and again that we've got a disease going on on the Internet 
today. I think that Jerry and his people should work with us to try and
solve this problem, rather than hiding behind the old constitutional
protection once again that simply says anything can go and you dare not
do anything about it because you're going to run afoul of the 
Constitution.  I think that's not reasonable. I think that is not
realistic.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Mr. Berman, how would you solve the problem?
<p>
<b>MR. BERMAN:</b> Two things. First of all, we tried to work with Sen. 
Exon, and we're still prepared to work with him and others in the House
to draft narrow statute which if there's -- the Justice Department can
show that there's a gap in current law and going after materials that
he's described, but we do not want to leave it to the discretion of
prosecutors all over the United States to decide what may be indecent.
And there are many times and there are places where "Ulysses" would be
considered indecent material, and, therefore, adults will have to have
the chilling effect of not knowing what they can put up on the Net. But
let's go to the real issue. I think that Sen.  Exon  has raised a very
important issue for the American public. The information highway I
stipulate has a lot of material on it which is very troublesome and
which our children should not get ahold of. The problem is that we
should not try to put forward solutions that are really fig leafs that
will not solve the problem. For example, the worldwide  Internet  is a
worldwide network. I don't know where Sen.  Exon downloaded the
materials that he found abhorrent, but if they're downloaded from Sweden
or they're downloaded from Denmark, which looks exactly like any U.S.
site, any law that he passes will not reach it. If you want to -- what
the Speaker is talking about is an approach which says let us really
look at the user end of the  Internet,  what kinds of technologies can
we bring on line to make it possible for parents to screen out and
control what they see or what they interact with on the Net and what
their children interact with? I have here, for example, a software
[holding up "Surf- Watch"] which is available on the market which
screens out adult sexual material. You just put it in with your
computer, and it keeps your kid out. America On-Line and other
information services are trying to put screening technology -- in fact,
they have screening technology and lock-out technology bundled into the
America On-Line, and they are trying to update that. The industry really
will respond. The problem, by bringing these technologies on board, what
Rep. Cox and Widen in the House, along with the Speaker, realize that
while Sen.  Exon's  bill is well-intentioned, it was drafted in a way
which creates disincentives for industry to do this kind of policing.
Under his legislation, if an  Internet provider like America On-Line
tried to control information, they are -- they cannot rely on the
defenses in the legislation for prosecuting of someone other than them
who puts up content.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Okay, let me ask the  Senator  about this. First of
all, Sen. Exon,  on the question of user, policing this by policing the
user, by using a technology which can block it for the user, a parent
could put something in their computer and make it impossible to get
Penthouse Magazine, which I read is the No. 1 site on the  Internet 
now, what's wrong with that?
<p>
<b>SEN.  EXON:</b>  There's nothing wrong with that. We didn't hear much
about that until the  Exon Decency Bill was widely considered and
debated. Yes, we have gotten the intention, and it may well be that
eventually -- although I am convinced that there's no way to filter out
all of this material. Let's take the case that Jerry just used. Let's
say that Mom and Dad could lock out on their computer, which you can't
do now, and Jerry knows you can't do it now, and there's nothing
available on the market today that would begin to take out everything
that is pornographic and obscene, but I'm certainly not saying that they
shouldn't try that. I don't believe that's going to work or be
effective. One of the problems that we have today is we tried to work
with Jerry, but we found out that basically Jerry goes back to the old
idea that I think is kind of foreign that Thomas Jefferson and all of
the good people who wrote the Constitution  worked overnight and planned
and plotted to make sure that the Constitution  protected the most gross
pornographers, pedophiles, those who are trying to lure children today.
Children can get this information outside the home. They can get it in
the schools. They can get it in the libraries. They can get it at the
neighbors. I wish that we could wake up, and maybe if I could get to
Newt Gingrich, maybe if he would at least look at the material that I
have and take a look at our bill that is not nearly as restrictive as
Jerry would like to believe it is, maybe we could solve the problem.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b> Mr. Berman, we have just a few seconds for a
response.
<p>
<b>MR. BERMAN:</b> Yes. But I'm sorry if I'm -- if I am associated with the
gang that goes back to Thomas Jefferson, I'm quite proud of that
association. We need to draft careful legislation here which is not
thrown out by the Supreme Court. We need to look at these technology
solutions. We should not pass bandaids. We should not go for press
releases, and I think the  Senator  has raised important issues. I think
he would -- it would behoove him to work with industry on the user
controls. That is the only effective way to deal with pornography on the
Internet.
<p>
<b>MS. FARNSWORTH:</b>  Senator,  Mr. Berman, thank you for being with us.
