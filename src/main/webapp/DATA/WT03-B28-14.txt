AVIATION TAXES LAPSE; TRUST FUND REVENUES DEPENDENT ON BUDGET DEAL

The revenue stream supporting the aviation trust fund halted Monday as
various aviation excise taxes lapsed because of the continued impasse
between Congress and the White House over a balanced budget. The expired
taxes are the 10% airline passenger ticket tax, the 6.25% cargo waybill
tax, the $6 international departure tax and the 17.5 center-per-gallon non-
commercial aviation fuel tax. A seven-year balanced budget vetoed by
President Clinton last month would have extended the excise taxes through
Sept. 30, 1996.
   Without the taxes, the only significant revenue flowing into the
aviation trust fund is the interest on the trust fund balance. In a
discussion with reporters last month, FAA Deputy Administrator Linda
Daschle said the uncommitted balance in the trust fund could be depleted in
eight or nine months if taxes do not resume. White House officials and
congressional leaders have continued to negotiate over a budget deal
throughout much of the holiday season and will resume talks this week.
Since Congress already has given FAA authority to obligate funds, including
Airport Improvement Program grants, for fiscal 1996, FAA spending should
not be affected by the tax expiration.

DOT UPHOLDS MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF LOS ANGELES LANDING FEES

   DOT late last month found 81.5% of disputed fees at Los Angeles
International Airport reasonable, ordering a reduction in the landing fee
to $1.68 from $2.06 per thousand pounds landed weight, and a refund of
approximately $5 million to the airlines. The decision differs from the
November recommended decision by DOT Administrative Law Judge Burton Kolko
on the issue of police department expenses. Contrary to Kolko's ruling,
DOT allowed for most of the police expenses sought by the city. However,
DOT kept with Kolko's decision to exclude charges sought for police work
beyond the airport's boundary.
   Kolko recommended that over the course of a year, the airlines were due
just over $7 million in refunds from the airport - representing 14 cents of
the disputed fee. Under DOT's decision, the city will have to refund or
credit airlines only nine cents per thousand pounds landed weight in fees
it found to be unreasonable.
   Under an existing agreement with the airlines, 29 cents of the disputed
fees relating to costs for airfield land valuation are collected and placed
in escrow pending litigation stemming from a June 30 DOT rates and charges
decision. Los Angeles will adjust the landing fee to $1.97, said John
Driscoll, executive director of the Department of Airports. Roughly $1.3
million will be returned to the airlines for collected fees allocated to
fire engine company costs. DOT did not prevent the city, however, from
later making a new allocation of the fire unit's cost when it reconciles
the airport's actual versus budgeted expenses.
   DOT disagreed with Kolko's decision that police expenses should be
bourne by the community, Driscoll noted. Rather, DOT said that those
expenses should be shared in part by the airlines and other airport revenue
sources, he said. "That was a big win for all of the airports in this
country. Had the judge's decision prevailed, it would have been a disaster
for airports across the country," Driscoll said. "Even with today's
decision, LAX's current landing fee is significantly lower than many other
U.S. international gateways." Driscoll said that the judge "upheld our
right to charge the airlines our legal fees in defending ourselves in these
lawsuits they have brought against us and lost. As a result, not one
dollar of taxpayer money will be used to pay legal costs."
   "Today's decision pays lip service to the congressional mandate
prohibiting cities, like Los Angeles, from diverting airport revenues to
pay for general public services," Air Transport Association President Carol
Hallett said. "We are left with no choice but to go back to Congress for
the second time in three years to get this mess cleaned up." Hallett said
that the increased landing fees are "nothing more than hidden taxes" for
Los Angeles area citizens. "The airport has nearly $1 billion in retained
earnings, and city hall projected a $50 million surplus for the current
fiscal year. You tell me who is kidding whom," she said.

JOHNSON CONTROLS WINS ATLANTIC CITY MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

   Johnson Controls Inc., Teterboro, N.J., was selected to operate Atlantic
City International Airport in a public/private partnership with South
Jersey Transportation Authority. According to authority Chairman Stanley
Glassey, Johnson Controls was selected from the final four firms vying for
the contract because it offered the best chance of minimizing airport
operating costs while the maximizing revenue stream (AIRPORTS, Dec. 5,
1995). In its proposal, the firm agreed to pay an independent company to
conduct appraisals of its performance. SJTA said a plan for automated
maintenance, data collection and management systems as well as demonstrated
affiliations with airlines and cargo carriers were key factors to the
firm's selection.
   The firm has a use and occupancy agreement at the airport set to expire
March 31. Once final negotiations are complete, this month Johnson
Controls will be awarded a five-year operations, maintenance and support-
services contract to begin April 1. A $8.4 million terminal expansion to
include the addition of a second level and passenger loading bridges also
will be completed that month. If for some reason a final agreement with
Johnson Controls is not reached, SJTA said it will begin negotiations with
Serco Corp. of Gibbsboro, N.J. despite the firm's "limited and only recent
experience operating civilian airports."
   "The new arrangement with Johnson Controls will be completely different
from what we have today," said SJTA Executive Director James Crawford. 
"Unlike the existing situation, Johnson Controls will be working for us,
and answering to us. The authority will make the critical management
decisions while providing incentives for Johnson Controls to minimize
expenses and increase revenue." Under terms of the agreement, the
authority will be able to control aviation rates, air service policy and
airline use agreements. AMR Services Corp., Fort Worth, Texas and Airport
Group International, Glendale, Calif., were also in contention for the
contract.

VIGGO BUTLER LEAVES AIRPORT GROUP INTERNATIONAL

   Airport Group International (AGI), Glendale, Calif. (formerly Lockheed
Air Terminal) said late last month that Viggo Butler, president and chief
executive officer, was leaving the company. Bob Aaronson, executive VP and
general manager, has assumed the role of chief executive on an interim
basis, and a permanent chief executive is expected to be named soon, the
company said. Butler, who will remain available to AGI as a consultant,
joined Lockheed Air Terminal in 1973 and became president in 1984. He also
was a VP of Lockheed Corporation from 1990 until a new ownership structure
was completed in 1995 (AIRPORTS, March 7).

ICAO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS RETAINING CURRENT NOISE LIMITS

   International Civil Aviation Organization's Committee on Aviation
Environmental Protection (CAEP/3) asked ICAO to retain its current
international aircraft noise limits "for the time being," the International
Air Transport Association said. IATA was in attendance of the CAEP/3
meetings held in Montreal last month as an observer. Additionally, any
"definitive decision on any changes" in limits of nitrogen oxides have been
referred to a mid-1996 meeting of the ICAO Council, IATA said.
   "IATA's policy is that there is no justification, on environmental,
technical or economic grounds, to increase stringency, at this time. But
the phase-out of older, less efficient aircraft and investment in equipment
embodying the latest technology to minimize noise and emissions," IATA
Director General Pierre Jeanniot said. "Changes to the Annex 16 noise
limits would have reduced the value of commercial aircraft in service and
therefore interfered with this fleet replacement process."

EC TO REVIEW LANDING CHARGES, AIRCRAFT FUEL TAX EXEMPTION

   The European Commission (EC) will review current tax exemptions applying
to aircraft fuel and to propose new rules on landing charges, according to
a discussion paper recently proposed by European Union Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock. The commission's green paper on "internalizing
external costs" in the transport sector pleads for more "efficient"
transport pricing - i.e. a system that reflects the "true costs" of
congestion, noise, pollution and accidents. The document mainly focuses on
road vehicles, but also announces some measures regarding air transport.
   In the first half of this year, the EC plans to propose a system of
"differentiated landing charges based on noise emissions." An example of
this approach is the introduction of differentiated port charges for
segregated ballast tankers, which are safer and more environmentally
friendly. The commission nevertheless admitted that "complicated aspects
of extra-community competition play a role in aviation and maritime
shipping." The tax exemption for aircraft fuels, "which could lead to a
distortion in transport choices," will be reviewed in the second half of
1996, the commission said.

TRANSPORT CANADA STRIKES AGREEMENTS ON TORONTO, WINNIPEG AIRPORT TRANSFERS

   Transport Canada last month said it had reached "common understandings"
with the airport authorities set up to operate Toronto and Winnipeg
airports, thus setting principal financial issues surrounding the transfer
of the airports to local control. A final agreement to transfer Toronto
Pearson International to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA)
under a 60-year lease could be signed early this year, and operational and
managerial control could be transferred to GTAA in about six months.
Transport Canada said it expects to complete negotiations with the Winnipeg
Airports Authority early this year, allowing for transfer of control by
late summer or early fall. Separately, Transport Canada announced last
month that Flin Flon, Manitoba, Airport has officially been transferred to
the City of Flin Flon.
   Sidney Valo, chairman of the non-profit GTAA, says the agreement will
create an environment "for the GTAA to move forward aggressive with its
plans to develop Pearson as the international gateway to North America."
Valo forsees a 130-gate terminal replacing Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson,
starting in four to six years, to be built in phases by the private sector
over 20 years at an estimated cost of $2 billion (Canadian). The new
terminal, capable of accommodating up to 50 million passengers a year,
would be linked to the existing Terminal 3. A Canadian Senate committee
last month concluded that Prime Minister Jean Chretien's controversial
termination of a previous government's legal deal to privatize and
redevelop Pearson was wrong (AIRPORTS, December 19).

TRANSPORT CANADA CITES 55 SAFETY ISSUES AT TORONTO PEARSON

   The first comprehensive audit of safety procedures at Toronto Pearson
International Airport in 10 years revealed 55 potential safety problems,
Transport Canada said. General Manager Lloyd McCoomb said that airport
operations are "very safe" and noted that some of the flaws identified in
the 84-page report have been corrected, notably procedural and training
issues. Based on inspections of ground operations in March, a 14-member
Transport Canada team that authored the report noted that, among other
things, aircraft movements on the aprons were inadequately monitored or
controlled, emergency crew response times were 10 seconds slower than the
international standard required on one of three runways, aircraft and
vehicles were straying on to runways from manuevering areas, congestion at
apron areas could delay emergency responses, the airport lacked a
firefighting training facility and the airport's safety plan is outdated.

HONG KONG AIRPORT AUTHORITY SIGNS AGREEMENT FOR CARGO TERMINAL OPERATION

   The Airport Authority of Hong Kong last month reached an agreement with
Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. to operate an air cargo terminal at the
new airport. The 320,000-square-meter facility will be able to handle up
to 2.6 million metric tons of cargo per year. The authority said it will
sign an agreement soon with Asia Airfreight Terminal Co. Ltd., which will
operate the airport's second air cargo terminal.

BELGIAN COURT RULES FOR LUFTHANSA IN GROUND-HANDLING ISSUE AT ZAVEMTEM

   Lufthansa Airport Services Brussels, a ground-handling subsidiary of the
German airline, has won the right to serve Lauda Air passengers at Brussels
Zaventem Airport. The Brussels Court of Appeal ruled for Lufthansa against
the Belgian Aviation Authority and ground-handling company Belgavia, which
Lufthansa accused of abusing their dominant position as they prevented it
from operating at Brussels. The court ruled that a partial exclusivity
agreement between BAA and Belgavia violates European Union competition law.
The dispute, dating from March 1994, followed Lufthansa's purchase of a
39.7% stake in Lauda Air.

LINK TO PART 150 PROGRAM COULD ALLOW AIP FUNDING FOR PART 161 STUDIES

   If an airport can tie its Part 161 study to its Part 150 program, it is
possible to receive Airport Improvement Program funds, FAA said recently.
FAA's Part 161 regulations, mandated by the 1990 noise act, set out notice
and review requirements for new local Stage 2 restrictions and notice,
review and approval requirements for Stage 3 restrictions.
   "This is a recent determination and to date we have not funded any Part
161 study," Cynthia Rich, FAA associate administrator for airports, told
officials at Pease Development Authority (PDA) in a letter last month. "We
believe Part 161 studies must be tied to FAR Part 150 to be eligible for
AIP." This can be done it two ways, Rich explained. For one, the Part 161
study can be a part of the scope of work of a Part 150 study and funded as
airport noise compatibility planning. Second, the Part 161 study could be
a recommended measure in a Part 150 program and approved by FAA as a noise
project.
   Rich said that Pease Development Authority may propose Part 161 funding
as a recommended measure in its Part 150 study which FAA is slated to
either approve or disapprove by Feb. 10. "A funding commitment cannot be
made until that process is concluded," Rich said. She further assured PDA
that receipt of AIP funds for the Part 161 study "will not have a
detrimental effect upon the future availability of FAA discretionary or
entitlement funds."
   "It is remarkably good news for airports throughout the country that the
FAA has changed its position and will now fund Part 161 studies," attorney
Peter Kirsch of Cutler & Stanfield said. He pointed out that in the past,
many airports have been concerned that initiating part 161 studies would
threaten other FAA funding.

NORTHWEST UNION OPPOSES POSSIBLE NEW MINNEAPOLIS-AREA AIRPORT

   Northwest's Machinists union unit last month voiced opposition to a
possible new airport to replace Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, saying the
airline might consider moving to a less costly facility elsewhere
(AIRPORTS, June 14, 1994). "Moving the airport to a new location could put
our members' jobs at risk," said Marvin Sandrin, president of Machinists
District 143. Northwest might consider moving outside the state where
facilities are already available such as a closed Air Force base.
   "There are a number of attractive alternatives" the airline might
consider if it is forced to move its maintenance operations, Sandrin said,
adding that Machinists will oppose any airport move because of the
estimated $2 billion financial burden it would place on Northwest. "If it
has a negative financial impact on the company, it will have a negative
impact on our members - the same members who took wage and benefit
concessions the last time Northwest Airlines's balance sheet went into the
red."

ALBUQUERQUE COMPLETES RUNWAY RECONSTRUCTION

   City of Albuquerque, N.M., Aviation Department has completed the $51.1
million Runway 3-21 reconstruction project. The project, which included
installation of airfield lighting an instrument landing system for all-
weather capability, associated storm drain improvements and a perimeter
fence and service road, was completed six months ahead of schedule. The
runway now has a fully capable instrument landing system and will be used
as an alternate air carrier runway to be used during construction and
rehabilitation of Runway 8-26 and during periods of emergency, snow
removal, maintenance and repair to the primary runway. Additional
improvements were also made to the taxiway system connecting Runway 3-21.
Engineering and design services were provided by Greiner, Inc.

ATA ESTIMATES AIRLINES' 1995 EARNINGS AT $2 BILLION

   U.S. scheduled airlines likely will earn a net profit of $2 billion for
1995, the Air Transport Association said in its yearend report. Carriers
earned $2.2 billion in the first three quarters of the year, and ATA
expects a break-even fourth quarter. The second best year for U.S.
carriers was 1988, when profits totaled $1.69 billion. The industry's last
profitable year was 1989, with earnings of meager $127.9 million.
   "After five long years of losses totaling $13 billion, airlines need
profits to repair balance sheets, buy new aircraft and get ready for the
21st century," said ATA President Carol Hallett. She noted that the
outlook for next year is hopeful, but said, "This financial performance
does nothing to change the industry's position that we need a continued
exemption for the federal fuel tax." For the year, the industry boarded
548 million passengers, a 3.7% increase over 1994 levels, according to
preliminary data. Total revenue passenger miles flown were up 4%, and the
average load factor hit a post-war record of 67%.

KLM FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST NORTHWEST

   KLM filed a lawsuit against international partner Northwest and its
directors over that carrier's move to put a "poison pill" provision in
place (AIRPORTS, Nov. 21). The suit, filed Dec. 27 in the Chancery Court
of Delaware, claims Northwest's action was "not to protect the Northwest
stockholders from hostile acquisition but to restrict KLM's ability to
exercise" an option to increase its holdings in Northwest from 19% to 24%.

TWA ADOPTS 'POISON PILL' PROVISION TO BLOCK HOSTILE TAKEOVERS

   TWA said last month that the board of directors had adopted a
stockholder rights plan or "poison pill" designed to protect the company
against an unsolicited takeover. "We have simply put a poison pill in
place," an airline spokesman said, "This is not in response to any specific
takeover attempt that we know of," he added.
   Under the plan, if an outsider acquires up to 15% of the carrier's
voting stock, or initiates a tender exchange that would result in control
of 20% the company, then current stockholders would receive rights to
purchase company shares. "This is designed to keep anyone from taking over
the company without paying a huge premium, unless they work with the
board," the spokesman said.

DOT PROPOSES TO GRANT OPERATING CERTIFICATE TO LAKER AIRWAYS

   DOT has issued a show cause order tentatively granting Laker Airways a
certificate to operate scheduled domestic and international service. The
department said it also will allow the carrier to enter into agreements
with charter operators and receive contract deposits after issuance of a
final order on the certification proceeding.
   Laker plans to operate scheduled combination service initially between
New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale, using Boeing 727-200 aircraft, and
transatlantic charter passenger service using three DC-10-30 aircraft. In
addition to scheduled domestic service, Laker intends to operate charter
flights between Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, on the one hand, and London
Gatwick, Manchester, Glasgow and Berlin, on the other. (Docket
