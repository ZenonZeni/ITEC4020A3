President Vetoes HHS Funding Bill

As promised, President Bush Nov. 19 vetoed the fiscal 1992 HHS
appropriations bill (H.R.2707) because of its provision overturning
1988 regulations barring abortion counseling at federally funded
family planning clinics. A quick vote to override the veto was
defeated Nov. 19, 276 to 156, or 12 votes short of the needed two-
thirds majority. "I will sign a bill that does not include language
that prohibits implementation of the abortion counseling and
referral rule," Bush said in his veto message. The President made it
clear that his argument with Congress is over abortion. "I have
informed the Congress on numerous occasions that. . .I would veto
any legislation that would entangle Title X with abortion." Title X of
the Public Health Service Act authorizes funds for family planning
clinics and bars provision of abortions. In 1988, HHS issued rules
prohibiting Title X clinics from referring patients to abortion
clinics; in May, the Supreme Court found the rules constitutional. A
bipartisan team of legislators amended the HHS funding bill to block
implementation of the rules until Oct. 1, 1992. In his message, Bush
says the rules do not inhibit the doctor/patient relationship and
allow women to receive "complete medical information." Speaking on
the Senate floor shortly after Bush's veto was received, Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) sharply criticized the President. "Abortion for
women is not the issue -- free speech for doctors is. The White
House is pandering to the right wing, and their position is
indefensible," Kennedy said. Twenty members of the House
Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues urged an veto override in a
Nov. 18 letter members of the House. "This is an unconscionable
intrusion on the right of free speech, on the right of health
professionals to advise their patients, and on the right of women to
make an informed decision," the letter read.

In 1992, Congress will take another shot at overturning the regs as
part of a Title X reauthorization. The House may try to vote on its
version (H.R.3090) before adjourning; the Senate already has
approved a freestanding bill (S.323) to overturn the ban. But final
votes wouldn't occur until 1992, moving the fight closer to the
election.

House Set To Block Medicaid Rules As White House Negotiations Drag

Congress appears poised to enact a short-term delay in Bush
Administration regulations limiting states' Medicaid fundraising.
With negotiations between the White House and the nation's
governors dragging, lawmakers seem determined to pass a bill
delaying an Administration bid to ban state use of provider tax
revenues to gain federal matching dollars. The question now is for
how long? A House bill (H.R.3595) scheduled for a Nov. 19 floor vote
would hold off the regulations until Sept. 30, 1992. That would
prompt a veto by President Bush, says HCFA Administrator Gail
Wilensky. The House is expected to approve the bill but may not have
the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. Senators are
waiting for the House to act before moving forward. Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) may push for a shorter
moratorium, perhaps until April or July. That would allow for
continued negotiations while blocking states from creating new
programs in the interim. HCFA and the National Governors' Assn.
(NGA) staff have negotiated a tentative agreement that would
eliminate use of "voluntary" donations by hospitals and others and
limit use of provider taxes to 22 percent of each state's Medicaid
budget. But that plan appears to be gaining little support from
individual states. The deal would have to be ratified by Congress,
which plans to adjourn by Thanksgiving. With time running out,
Wilensky says she would favor a short term moratorium that also
would block states from starting new programs. Otherwise, "the
short-term federal exposure to increased Medicaid spending will be
virtually unlimited," she says. Steps should be "taken now to revise
our approach to donations and taxes," she told the Finance
Committee Nov. 19. Bentsen says HCFA should "be prepared to freeze
frame the issue" so negotiators can spend the next weeks working
toward a "reasonable" deal.

A key sticking point in the negotiations is state designation of
disproportionate share hospitals. HCFA wants to limit states' ability
to choose those hospitals. Some states are giving all of their acute
care hospitals that status and paying the higher rates with income
derived from provider taxes. HCFA and the NGA have suggested
limiting the size of payment increases to 11-to-12.5 percent. But
hospital groups are threatening to go to court if any limits are
included. A coalition of 61 groups representing hospitals, children,
and labor are urging lawmakers to block the regulations. The
governors efforts are "well intentioned," says National Assn. of
Public Hospitals President Larry Gage but the compromise is "ill
conceived and unacceptable." NAPH filed suit Nov. 14 to try to
declare the regulations illegal. Alabama also has filed suit. But
Texas Gov. Ann Richards told the Finance Committee Nov. 19 that
most states would be willing to accept a cap on disproportionate
share payments if HCFA gives states flexibility "to spend the money
in the way that works best."

Self-Insured Tax Credit Could Expire

The 25 percent health insurance tax deduction for self-employed
workers appears likely to expire at the end of 1991 but may be
resurrected in 1992. The credit, which was created in 1986, was
extended in 1990 for one year and is due to expire Dec. 31. Sen. John
Danforth (R-MO) and Rep. Frank Guarini (D-NJ) have offered
legislation (S.1950, H.R.3752) to extend the credit for one year, but
sources say it is unlikely Congress will act before adjourning for
1991. Also due to expire: a 20 percent tax credit for research and
development and a 5 percent tax credit for orphan drug development.
Danforth and Guarini also would extend those for one year. But
extension of the expiring tax breaks would cost the government
about $5 billion over the next five years, a move that would bust the
budget. House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski
(D-IL) also is concerned that a small tax bill would become a
"Christmas tree" on which to hang other tax breaks. Senate Finance
Committee Chief Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) predicts the credit will be
extended retroactively if a free standing bill fails to pass.
Individuals and corporations wouldn't be affected by the delay since
they still get a writeoff for 1991. Hoping to pull those nails from
the coffin, 76 Senators sent a Nov. 14 letter to Senate leaders
George Mitchell (D-ME) and Robert Dole (R-KS), saying they will
"oppose any amendment to a bill which extends these 12 expiring tax
provisions." Bentsen and Rostenkowski recently proposed expanding
the credit for the self-insured from 25 percent to 100 percent.

No Hill Override Expected On Medicare Physician Fee Plan

Congress won't try to override HCFA's decision to reduce 1992
Medicare physician fees to offset an expected surge in the volume of
services provided the elderly and disabled. On Nov. 15, HCFA
announced the final terms of the fee schedule, which kick in Jan. 1.
As expected, the agency decided to reduce fees paid under that
schedule by 6.5 percent in expectation of a 3 percent rise in volume.
Doctors have been protesting the so-called behavioral offset for
months but despite sympathetic rhetoric, lawmakers don't appear to
have an interest in fighting HCFA. Under the rules, which HCFA plans
to publish this week in the Federal Register, fees paid for primary
care services and to rural doctors will rise while payments to
surgeons and other specialists will decrease. A fight with Congress
was avoided when HCFA agreed in August to eliminate an
asymmetrical transition to the new schedule that would have
resulted in lower fees (HLeg. 8/28/91). More than 300 members of
the House had cosponsored a bill (H.R.3070) by Rep. Pete Stark (D-
CA), chairman of the House Ways & Means Health Subcommittee, to
override that proposal. Nearly 30 members of the Senate had signed
a companion measure (S.1810) by Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). While the
Stark-Rockefeller proposal also would have blocked the behavioral
offset, lawmakers were more concerned with the cumulative effect
of the proposed rules. In the final plan, HCFA Administrator Gail
Wilensky says fees will be 13.2 percent higher than those included
in the earlier version. Wilensky argues that the behavioral offset --
which she now calls a baseline adjustment -- is needed to keep the
new system budget neutral. The 1989 law creating the schedule
requires the program to cost no more and no less than the old
system.

By eliminating the skewed transition, HCFA was able to raise the
conversion factor -- which translates the relative value scale (RVS)
into dollars -- from $26.87 in the June proposed rules to $31 in the
final version. Counting inflation, Wilensky says overall payments to
physicians will rise from $27.3 billion in 1991 to $47.5 billion in
1996. The 74 percent jump in physician spending over the next five
years also encompasses inflation, the aging of the population, and
introduction of new technology. But despite that cumulative rise, in
1992 many doctors will see their fees fall. Reductions include a 14
percent cut for thoracic surgeons, an 11 percent reduction for
anesthesiologists and ophthalmologists, and a 10 percent chop for
gastroenterologists, radiologists, pathologists and neurosurgeons.
Fees will rise sharply for primary care specialists including general
practitioners, who will get a 17 percent increase, family
practitioners, 15 percent, and optometrists, who will see a 20
percent hike. To buffer the effects of the behavioral offset,
Wilensky has made other changes to the rules to help specific
specialties. HCFA has agreed to temporarily let anesthesiologists
count the actual time they spend with a patient until a better coding
system is developed and to count only services provided the day
before surgery rather than 30 days when figuring global surgical
fees.

Disease Prevention Services Bill Readied For House Consideration

A new private nonprofit foundation would be created to supplement
disease prevention efforts by the Centers for Disease Control under
a bill (H.R.3635) moving toward the House floor. Approved Nov. 15 by
the House Commerce Committee, the bill would extend for five years
the preventive health services block grant at $135 million for fiscal
1992 and "such sums as necessary" through FY96. It also would
authorize use of part of the preventive block grants for states to
develop trauma care systems. The plan by Commerce Health
Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) also would require
states to submit by Apr. 1, 1992, a list of health goals for the year
2000, and authorizes $10 million for that effort. A Senate
companion bill (S.1912) introduced Nov. 4 by Peter Domenici (R-NM),
the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, is pending in
the Finance Committee. No action is expected until after recess.

House VA Panel Backs Drug Discount Bill

Legislation to roll back prescription drug prices paid by veterans'
hospitals won approval Nov. 13 from the House Veterans' Affairs
Committee. The bill (H.R.2890), would set prices at the level paid on
Sept. 1, 1990, in order to negate a year of sharp price increases. It
also would limit annual price hikes of veterans' medical inflation
rates. The legislation comes a year after Congress required drug
makers to give Medicaid their "best price." That triggered price hikes
to Veterans Administration (VA) facilities and others who had been
receiving deep discounts. The House bill, by Veterans' Committee
Chairman Sonny Montgomery (D-MS) would exempt VA from
calculation of Medicaid prices. That concerns members of the House
Commerce Committee who worry that exempting the VA will raise
drug prices for Medicaid and various public health clinics. Commerce
Committee member Ron Wyden (D-OR) plans to amend Montgomery's
bill to roll back drug prices for all government buyers. Montgomery
is said to be receptive "as long as it doesn't leave the VA
vulnerable."

Democrats Call Off Health Reform Vote, Mitchell Scrambles for
Support

Senate Democrats were forced to call off a planned vote on their
health reform plan because of continued disagreement among party
members. Human Resources Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy (D-
MA) hoped to report the bill (S.1227) out of his committee Nov. 14
but was ordered to cancel the session by Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D-ME), the bill's chief sponsor. Mitchell still is trying to
gain support for the plan from Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen (D-TX), who balks at the proposal to mandate employer-paid
insurance. Kennedy had rewritten the bill to circumvent Finance, but
Mitchell didn't like that tactic. Instead, the vote was "postponed"
until Jan. 22, the first scheduled day of the Senate's 1992 session.
Mitchell meanwhile plans to conduct five field hearings in December
and early January "to hear from individual Americans and businesses
that have been bankrupted by the current system." The hearings will
be held in Tampa FL, Atlanta GA, Cleveland OH, Detroit MI, and Denver
CO. Mitchell's orders didn't sit well with Democrats on the panel who
want to build on the momentum created by the Nov. 5 election of
Pennsylvania Sen. Harris Wofford, who ran on a health reform
platform. Republicans label Mitchell's hearings "a show designed to
make Republicans look bad." "If we don't work together we'll end up
with a partisan piece of junk," said the panel's senior GOP member
Orrin Hatch (R-UT).

House Democrats appear no closer to agreement than their Senate
counterparts. After failing to develop a consensus behind one
proposal, the House Democratic Caucus last week backed a
resolution to support legislation that would guarantee universal
health care. The resolution is supposed to "keep the process moving
along," says an aide to Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer (D-MD). Earlier
this summer, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-WA) asked his senior
committee chairmen to draft a reform plan. So far there is little
agreement and Ways & Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL)
introduced his own bill (H.R.3626).

Health Professions, Prevention Bills Travel On Senate Fast Track

Congress hopes to quickly complete work on a bill to reauthorize aid
to medical and nursing students and the schools that train them
along with another measure to continue several disease prevention
programs. Introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA), the bills were
approved a week later by the Human Resources Committee. The first
(S.1933) would authorize $525 million in fiscal 1992, $555 million
in FY93, $610 million in FY94, $636 million in FY95, and $660
million in FY96 to support training of nurses, nurse midwives, nurse
anesthetists, physician assistants, and primary care physicians. The
measure also would require grantees to provide instruction on
universal precautions and infection control for HIV transmission.
The second (S.1944) would authorize $275 million in FY92 and "such
sums as necessary" for FY93-96 to provide grants for breast and
cervical screening, hypertension and cholesterol screening, health
education, emergency medical technician training, rodent control,
water fluoridation, and dental health.

Cohen, Pryor Propose DME Reforms

The number of Medicare carriers handling claims for durable medical
equipment (DME) would be reduced from 34 to five under a bill by
Sens. William Cohen (R-ME) and David Pryor (D-AR). An investigation
by Cohen's staff of the Senate Aging Committee uncovered as much
as $200 million in annual fraud and abuse in Medicare's DME program.
The bill (S.1988) is similar to measures (S.1736, H.R.2534) offered
by Sen. Jim Sasser (D-TN) and Rep. Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) earlier
this year (HLeg. 9/11/91). The reforms are supported by the National
Assn. of Medical Equipment Suppliers (NAMES). The Cohen/Pryor bill
also would prevent DME suppliers from shopping for the best-paying
carrier by establishing uniform coverage and utilization criteria and
requiring HHS to set requirements for issuing and renewing provider
numbers. The Senate bills primarily address fraud and abuse in the
DME system, while the House bill also tries to solve some of
administrative problems facing carriers, says Corrine Parver, NAMES
president. The bills will probably not see action before Congress'
recess but could be a 1992 priority.

HCFA Needs More Enforcement Authority Over Medicare HMOs

HCFA should be given broader authority to penalize Medicare HMOs
that fail to comply with quality standards, says the General
Accounting Office. In Nov. 15 testimony to the House Commerce
Health Subcommittee, GAO said its investigation into a Florida HMO
revealed that HCFA has "not been effective in getting certain HMOs
to take corrective actions promptly." The GAO investigation of
Humana Inc. found abuses of federal standards of marketing, claims
payment, processing of beneficiary appeals, and implementation of
an internal quality assurance system. Humana enrolls about 15
percent of the 1.3 million Medicare HMO members. In 1987, following
problems with the previous owners of the Humana plan, Congress
gave HCFA the power to levy fines and short suspensions against
HMOs that violate federal rules. Since then, HCFA has terminated
two contractors from Medicare. HCFA should be allowed to suspend
Medicare enrollments when HMOs fail to respond to violations
notices, says GAO. HCFA Administrator Gail Wilensky defended the
agency's record, pointing to development of a "strengthened and
streamlined enforcement" process. Wilensky also cited publication
of a July 22 proposed rule to implement intermediate sanctions and
civil monetary penalty authority, which defined eight violations for
which sanctions can be imposed.

Health Professions Education

MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS: Graduate programs in social work that
offer a training concentration in health or mental health care and
graduate programs that provide training in a concentration leading
to a graduate degree in marriage and family therapy would be
included among the programs for which support could be provided.

A Subcommittee on Allied Health would be established to the
National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education. The
Subcommittee would advise with respect to a broad range of issues
relating to allied health education and placement.

Prohibitions against discrimination in administration of the program
would be expanded. Health professions data collection requirements
would be expanded to include information pertaining to health
profession shortage areas.

GRANT PRIORITY: In awarding grants under the health professions
program and under the nurse education program, the HHS Secretary
would give priority to entities with programs designed to help meet
the National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives
established for the year 2000 and that either have a high permanent
rate for placing graduates in settings to serve underserved
populations or provide for at least four of six specified activities
designed to encourage graduates to practice in such areas.

Preference in the awarding of competitive grants to health
professions schools would be given to schools that can demonstrate
that at least 20 percent of their graduates practice in shortage
areas or that the number of graduates practicing in such areas has
increased by at least 50 percent over that for the previous two-year
period.

STUDENT ASSISTANCE: Funding for the federal student loan insurance
program would be provided through fiscal 1996. Certain changes
would be made with regard to the period to begin repaying loans and
the maximum interest that could be charged for such loans. Health
professions education institutions would have to agree to assist in
the collection of delinquent loan payments by providing information
concerning the borrower to the Secretary and to lenders.

The Secretary would establish performance standards and fees to be
paid by lenders and loan holders for the servicing of loans and for
the processing of default claims. The bill would redefine the term
"default rate." The Secretary would assess a risk-based premium on
an eligible borrower and, if required, an eligible institution based on
the default rate of the institution. For institutions with default
rates below 5 percent, the borrower would be assessed 6 percent of
the loan amount.

If the default rate of the institution is between 5 percent and 15
percent, the borrower would be assessed a premium of 10 percent
and the institution a premium of 5 percent. If the institution's
default rate is between 15 percent and 25 percent, the borrower and
the institution each would be assessed a premium of 10 percent of
the loan amount. Other procedural provisions are set out.

There would be no statute of limitations with regard to loan
repayment obligations. An annual report concerning default rates
would be required for each institution that participates in loan
programs as well as for each lender and for each loan holder. A list
of borrowers who are in default would be compiled and published in
the Federal Register.

The Secretary would promulgate regulations to ensure that tuition
and fees for borrowers are equal to or less than those for
nonborrowers; to require institutions to submit information
concerning each loan that is made; to allow the withholding of
services from an institution to a borrower who is in default; and to
have lenders offer borrowers a variety of repayment options.
Institutions would be required to conduct workshops for student
borrowers.

The National Health Service Corps would give priority to borrowers
who enter and remain in the primary care fields of general internal
medicine, general pediatrics, and family medicine.

An Office for Health Education Assistance would be created to study
loans and loan defaults, to respond to circumstances that may lead
to defaults, to carry out activities to reduce defaults, and to carry
out other similar activities.

DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM: The bill would establish a direct student
loan demonstration program to examine the viability of such a
program and to determine whether such a program will reduce
default costs and provide loans on more favorable terms and to
determine whether the current Health Education Assistance Loan
authority should be replaced by a direct loan program in which
schools rather than lenders make loans directly to borrowers.

The bill outlines the detailed procedures and conditions that would
apply in creating this direct student loan demonstration program.
The program would involve at least 20 institutions.

OTHER ASSISTANCE AUTHORITIES: The loan repayment program for
allied health personnel would be extended through FY96 as would
authority for scholarships for first year health professions students
of exceptional financial need, the scholarship authority for students
from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the faculty loan repayment
program. The Lister Hill Scholarship Program would be repealed.

SPECIAL PROGRAM GRANTS: Funding would be provided through FY96 to
assist departments of family medicine. Area Health Education Center
(AHEC) agreements would be for six years. Preference in awarding AHEC
grants would be for applicants that would establish new programs.
Priority would go to applicants that establish linkages with a school
of public health if such a school exists in the area. Various other
expansions would be authorized for the AHEC program.

Funding would continue for programs of excellence in health
professions education for minorities; for training, traineeships, and
fellowships in general internal medicine and general pediatrics; for
dentistry residency programs; and for family medicine residency
programs. There would be new authority for assistance for training
in dental public health. Educational assistance to individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds also would be continued. There would be
a new program of minority faculty development fellowships.
Authority to assist schools that provide the first or last two years
of medical education would be replaced by demonstration grant
authority for the improvement of health professions education and
for the assurance of competency of health personnel. There would be
new authority for chiropractic training and demonstration grants.

Also extended would be assistance for training in preventive
medicine, physician assistant programs, and podiatric medicine
programs. AIDS education and training program authority would be
expanded. Also extended would be authority for geriatric education
centers and geriatric training.

Programs of assistance for projects for schools of public health
would be extended as would various other public health training
authorities.

There would be new grant authority for projects related to allied
health professions with personnel shortages. An extensive listing of
possible project areas is provided. Assistance also would be
authorized for training centers for allied health professions to
provide fellowships to students. The program of traineeships for
advanced training of allied health personnel would be extended and
expanded. A Division of Allied Health would be created.

OTHER PROGRAMS: Changes would be made in the mission of the
Council on Graduate Medical Education to place greater emphasis on
the adequacy of current and future supplies of primary care
physicians, to study the impact of Medicare graduate medical
education funding, and the feasibility of including health promotion
and disease prevention as a part of graduate medical education.

New activities would be required under the rural health training
program with emphasis on research on the processes involved in
health care decisionmaking and development of training models
focusing on disease prevention and health promotion.

An advisory Council on Medical Licensure would be created. It would
advise the Secretary concerning the establishment and operation of
the American Medical Association system for verifying and
maintaining information regarding the qualification of individuals to
practice medicine. The Secretary also would conduct a study of state
licensure procedures for domestic medical graduates as compared to
international medical graduates.

Nurse Training

SPECIAL PROJECTS: Various changes would be made in the special
project authority to emphasize assistance to nurses serving in
shortage areas. The bill would extend the advanced nurse education
programs, the nurse practitioner and nurse midwife programs,
nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged
backgrounds, traineeships for advanced education of professional
nurses, the nurse anesthetist program, the nurse loan repayment
program, and assistance for undergraduate education of professional
nurses. New authority would provide funds to assist schools of
nursing to support projects to develop resources or strengthen
programs or faculty to address the National Health Objectives for
the year 2000.

A new program would provide fellowships to licensed vocational or
practical nurses, nursing assistants, and other paraprofessional
nursing personnel to assist them in obtaining a professional nursing
education. Such individuals would agree to work in long term care
facilities for a period of time at least equal to the period during
which the individual received assistance.

A new primary care program authority also would be established.
The funds would be used to establish or expand clinical nurse
training sites to provide training in the delivery of primary care in
rural areas or areas within 50 miles of Indian country.

Health Professions Amendments

The bill would amend and extend various authorities for educational
assistance for schools and students of the health professions. The
bill also would amend and extend the Nurse Training Act.

PRIMARY SERVICES PRIORITY: The bill would add a general provision
to the Public Health Service Act provisions authorizing support for
health professions education providing that in the case of any entity
applying for federal financial assistance under that authority, the
HHS Secretary would give priority to the applicant if a substantial
percentage of the providers who have completed the applicants
program of training in the health or allied health professions are
providing primary health services to a substantial number of
medically underserved individuals or if the applicant has established
policies that may reasonably be expected to result in a substantial
percentage of the program's participants providing their services to
a substantial number of such individuals.

Schools of medicine and osteopathy, in order to qualify for priority
consideration, also would have to have an academic administrative
unit to provide clinical instruction in family medicine and would
have to require, as a condition of receiving a degree, that each
student have had significant clinical training in family medicine by
the end of the third year of the curriculum.

Applicants with residency programs would receive priority in
receiving federal support only if a substantial percentage of the
individuals completing the residency program have had, through
participation in the applicant's program, significant experience in
providing primary health services to medically underserved
individuals or significant experience in providing such services in
ambulatory health facilities.

GRADUATE STUDENT INSURED LOANS: The total principal amount of
new loans and installments paid to borrowers covered by federal
graduate student loan insurance could not exceed $365 million, $425
million, and $475 million respectively for fiscal years 1992-1994.
Currently repayment of loans must begin within twelve months of
completing a program or ceasing to be a participant in a program for
which the loan was made. The bill would allow initial repayment to
begin up to 21 months after the determining event has occurred.

The premium charged by the Secretary for insured loans currently
cannot exceed eight percent. The bill would increase the maximum
allowable premium to 13 percent. Different percentages could be
charged for different health professionals.

The bill would authorize the Secretary to impose on eligible
institutions, eligible lenders, and holders reasonable limits on
default rates for borrowers. If any such limit is exceeded, the
Secretary could suspend, terminate, or otherwise restrict the
authority for students to obtain insured loans from the school or
lender in question or, if it is a holder who exceeds such a limit, for
the holder to purchase insured loans.

The term "default rate" means the percentage constituted by the
ratio of the principal amount of insured loans that are made with
respect to an entity and enter repayment status after Apr. 7, 1987,
and for which amounts have been paid to insurance beneficiaries,
exclusive of any loans for which amounts have been paid as a result
of death or total and permanent disability of the borrowers, and
exclusive of any loans for which amounts have been paid but have
been recovered or are being recovered by the Secretary, to the total
principal amount of insured loans that are made with respect to the
entity and enter repayment status after Apr. 7, 1987.

OFFICE OF DEBT COLLECTION: The bill would establish an Office on Student
Loan Debt Collection. The Director of the Office would coordinate efforts
within the HHS Department and the Department of Justice to recover
payments from health professionals who have defaulted on insured student
loans. In cooperation with the Secretary of Education, the Director would
develop a uniform deferral form or process to ensure coordination in
deferment certification requirements for in-school, residency, and
internship deferments.

The Director would provide advice to eligible lenders, institutions,
and holders of deferrals of the provisions that relate to collection
of the principal and interest on insured loans. The Director would
assist students in avoiding default by making information on loan
deferments, forbearance, and correction of default readily available
and, directly or through the provision of grants and contracts, would
carry out projects to reduce the extent of defaults on insured loans.
The Director annually would report to Congress on the total amounts
recovered and would provide a plan for improving the extent of
recoveries during the year.

NEEDY STUDENTS: Any funds from a student loan fund that are
returned to the Secretary could not be available for any purpose
other than allotment for other student loan funds. The bill would
authorize $9,760,000 for FY92, $11 million for FY93, and $13
million for FY94 for scholarships for first year students of
exceptional need and $17 million for each of FY92 and 1993 for
scholarships and other purposes regarding disadvantaged students.

Current faculty, and anyone who has been on the faculty of a school
during the previous 18 months, would be ineligible for the loan
repayment program regarding service by disadvantaged students on
faculties of health professions schools. Loan repayments under the
program would be reduced from 50 percent a year to 20 percent a
year of the outstanding principal and interest on loans.

FAMILY MEDICINE: The bill would authorize $6,830,000 for FY92 to
assist in the establishment of departments of family medicine.
Authority for this assistance would be repealed as of Oct. 1, 1992.

FUNDING OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMS: The area health education center
authority would be funded at $20 million, $22 million, and $24
million for FY92-94 respectively. The bill would provide $15 million
and $16 million for FY92 and FY93 for programs of excellence in
health professions education for minorities.

The bill would provide $17,260,000, $18.5 million, and $20 million
for FY92-94 respectively for training, traineeships, and fellowships
in internal medicine and general pediatrics. Currently the first two
purposes for which these funds can be utilized are for the planning,
development, and support of residency training programs and
residents in these practice areas. The bill would expand the eligible
programs for these funds to include professional training programs,
including residencies and internships, in these areas for medical and
osteopathy students, interns, residents, or practicing physicians and
financial support for the individuals participating in these programs.

Funding for residency programs in the general practice of dentistry
would be provided at $3,830,000, $4.5 million, and $6 million for
1992-1994. Authorized for family medicine programs would be
$36.1 million, $43 million, and $45 million.

Educational assistance to individuals from disadvantaged
backgrounds would be authorized at $30,820,000 and $31.5 million
for FY92 and FY93. The Secretary would assure that these grants are
equitably distributed geographically and that services of individuals
from disadvantaged backgrounds are equitably allocated among the
various racial and ethnic populations.

The bill recodifies provisions relating to training in preventive
medicine authorizing $1,650,000, $2 million, and $2 million for
1992-1994 respectively, for these activities. Authority to assist
schools which provide the first two or last two years of medical
education and to aid in faculty and curriculum development and
clinical training sites would be deleted.

There would be new authority for health professions research.
Recipients of grants and contracts would conduct research on one or
more of the following: the impact of student indebtedness on
specialty choice and practice location; the impact of minority health
professional programs in majority schools on recruitment,
retention, and practice choices of minority health personnel; the
effects of graduate medical education payments on the distribution
of physician specialties; and the effectiveness and variation of
state licensing authorities in identifying problem providers and
undertaking disciplinary actions. Funding would be authorized at
$1,320,000, $1.5 million, and $1.5 million. The bill also would
authorize $7 million, $8 million, and $10 million for 1992-1994 for
physician assistant projects and $600,000, $750,000, and $750,000
for podiatric physician projects.

AIDS TRAINING: Schools of marriage and family therapy would be added
to those eligible to receive grants to train faculty to teach health
professions students to provide for the health care needs of
individuals with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Funding for
this general training program would be authorized at $17,020,000, $19
million, and $21 million. For such training at schools of dentistry
the bill would authorize $6 million, $8 million, and $10 million.

MEDICAL SOCIAL WORK: Graduate programs of medical social work
would be added to those eligible for aid to assist individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds as well as to those which can receive
assistance for training with respect to AIDS.

The term "graduate program in medical social work" is defined to
mean an accredited graduate program which provides training
leading to a graduate degree in social work and which emphasizes
the provision of social services related to health care or mental
health care.

GERIATRIC TRAINING: Current authority to train physicians and
dentists who plan to teach geriatric medicine or dentistry would be
expanded to include optometrists who plan to teach geriatric
optometry.

Currently such programs are for one year. The bill would eliminate
the one year specification. Also currently, with regard to dental
geriatric training programs, training is available to dentists who
are faculty members at schools of dentistry or hospital departments
of dentistry. The bill would amend these eligibility provisions to
make this training available to dentists who have demonstrated a
commitment to an academic career, and who have completed
postdoctoral dental training programs or who have relevant training
or experience.

Funding for geriatric education centers and geriatric training would
be authorized at $13,710,000, $14 million, and $15 million
respectively for FY92-94.

YEAR 2000 HEALTH OBJECTIVES: Current authority for special
projects conducted by schools of public health would be replaced by
authority for special projects by such schools to establish
comprehensive programs of education that are appropriate with
respect to meeting the objectives established by the Secretary for
the health status of the population of the U.S. for the year 2000.
Also authorized would be projects to recruit individuals for
education in health specialties in which an increased number of
practitioners is necessary to meet the year 2000 objectives and to
improve access to community-based health prokbe emphasized in the
awarding of public health traineeships. Under the bill students would
have to be pursuing a course of study in a field the entry into which
is appropriate with respect to meeting the Secretary's health status
objectives for the year 2000.

ALLIED HEALTH: In awarding project grants regarding allied health
personnel the Secretary would give special consideration to unique
needs regarding the supply of physical therapists, occupational
therapists, and clinical laboratory technologists.

Currently recipients of traineeships for advanced training of allied
health personnel must be doctoral students in doctoral programs.
The bill would allow traineeships to postgraduate students in
postgraduate programs. Special consideration to the unique needs
regarding the supply of the above mentioned therapists and
technologists also would be provided with regard to these
traineeships.

HEALTH CARE FOR RURAL AREAS: Schools or programs for marriage
and family therapy would be eligible for grants to improve the
delivery of health services for rural areas.

Nurse Education

SPECIAL PROJECTS: The bill would delete authority for special
projects to provide continuing education for nurses, to demonstrate
improved geriatric training in preventive care, acute care, and long
term care, and to collect the names of health facilities willing to
repay loans for nurses who agree to serve in the facilities. Also
authority to develop curricula for the achievement of baccalaureate
degrees by registered nurses would be replaced by authority for
projects for nursing assistants and other paraprofessional nursing
personnel to become licensed vocational or practical nurses for
nursing facilities.

There are provisions to allow continuation of already funded
projects of the types to be deleted.

ADVANCED NURSE EDUCATION: The bill would delete authority to
provide assistance to maintain programs which lead to masters' and
doctoral degrees and which prepare nurses to serve as
administrators, researchers, or to serve in clinical nurse specialties
determined by the Secretary to require advanced education.
Assistance still would be provided to plan, develop, operate, or
significantly expand such programs but only with regard to programs
that prepare nurses to serve in clinical nurse specialties. No more
than 10 percent of funds appropriated for advanced nurse education
could be used for programs leading to doctoral degrees.

NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND MIDWIVES: Authority to assist
traineeship programs for nurse practitioners and nurse midwives
would be repealed.

PROJECTS FOR DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS: Funding for special
projects for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds would be
authorized at $4 million, $5 million, and $6 million for 1992-1994.

ADVANCED EDUCATION TRAINEESHIPS: Authority for project grants
for nursing school faculty investigations into alternate health care
modalities, nursing interventions that result in positive outcomes
and similar matters would be deleted. The current authority to
provide traineeships for nurses in advanced degree programs would
be expanded to allow traineeships for individuals in these programs.
Only individuals in master's degree programs would be eligible for
these traineeships. Doctoral candidates no longer would be eligible.
Authority to provide these traineeships for programs to train
individuals to serve in and prepare for practice as nurse
administrators, nurse educators, and nurse researchers would be
deleted.

In awarding these traineeships for advanced education special
consideration would be given to programs that provide significant
clinical experience in any of the following: an Indian Health Service
health center; a Native Hawaiian health center; a public hospital; a
migrant or community health center or other nonprofit community
clinic; a nursing facility; a rural health clinic; or a health facility
located in a health professional shortage area determined by the HHS
Secretary to have a critical shortage of nurses.

Funding for advanced nursing education traineeships would be
authorized at $17 million, $19 million, and $21 million with at least
25 percent of appropriated funds to be used for traineeships for
students who are enrolled at least on a half-time basis in programs
that offer a master's degree in nursing and who agree to complete
the requirements for the degree by the end of the academic year in
which the traineeship is provided.

NURSE ANESTHETISTS: The bill would add a provision indicating that
in making grants for nurse anesthetist training grants the Secretary
would give special consideration to applications for traineeship
programs whose participants gain a significant experience in
providing health services at rural hospitals or rural clinics.

The nurse anesthetist program would be funded at $3 million, $4
million, and $5 million respectively for FY92-94.

STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS: Current law authorizes $5 million a year
for loan repayments for service in facilities such as those referred
to above in the advanced education traineeship provisions. The bill
would authorize $3 million, $4 million, and $5 million for FY92-94
respectively.

OTHER PROVISIONS: The authority for undergraduate scholarships for
nursing students would be ended. The bill also would make schools of
nursing eligible, along with already authorized health professions
schools and schools of allied health, for geriatric training and
related activities. This authority is similar to that which relates
only to schools of nursing and which would be repealed as outlined
above.

LABORATORY TECHNOLOGIST STUDY: The Secretary would conduct a
study with respect to the shortage of clinical laboratory
technologists. The purpose of the study would be to determine the
extent of the shortage, determine the causes of the shortage, and
develop recommendations on the manner in which the shortage can
be alleviated.

In developing recommendations the Secretary would consider any
special or unique factors affecting the supply of clinical laboratory
technologists in rural or urban areas and would consider the
effectiveness of any mechanisms that are available for alleviating
the shortage in rural areas, urban areas, or both, including
competency-based examinations as an alternative route for
certification of the competence of individuals to serve as such
technologists, and consider the role of entities that provide such
certification.

MEDICAL LICENSURE ADVISORY COUNCIL: The Secretary would
establish an Advisory Council on Medical Licensure. The Advisory
Council would advise the Secretary regarding the establishment and
operation of the system established by the American Medical
Association for verifying and maintaining information regarding
qualifications of individuals to practice medicine.

The Advisory Council would monitor the operation of the private
verification system and develop recommendations for improvement.
The Council would determine to what extent the system has
expedited and otherwise improved the efficiency and equitable
operation of the process of licensure in one state of individuals who
previously have been licensed in another.

The Council would review the policies and practices of the states in
licensing international medical graduates and in licensing domestic
medical graduates and would consult with appropriate organizations
regarding the establishment of nondiscriminatory policies and
practices of licensing individuals to practice medicine.

The 14-member Advisory Council would consist of a representative
from each of the following; state licensure authorities, practicing
physicians, the private verification system, medical schools, an
organization that tests international medical graduates, an
organization that tests graduates of U.S. medical schools, a native of
the U.S. who attended a U.S. medical school, an international medical
school graduate from a coalition of such graduates as well as
international medical school graduates to represent schools from
southern or eastern Asia; Europe, Australia or New Zealand; a
subsaharan African country; and a Latin American or Caribbean
country, and a native of the U.S. who is an international medical
school graduate.

During FY96 the Secretary would determine whether the private
verification system is operating with a reasonable degree of
efficiency and whether the policies and practices of the system are
nondiscriminatory.

If the Secretary finds that the system fails to meet either of these
criteria, the Secretary would develop a plan for the establishment of
a national verification system. If the Secretary finds that the
private system meets the criteria, the Advisory Council would
terminate.

INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL GRADUATE LICENSURE REPORTS: With
respect to licensure by the states of individuals to practice
medicine, the Secretary annually would conduct a study of at least
10 states. The study would determine the average length of time
required for the states involved to process the licensure
applications of domestic medical graduates and the length of time
for such processing for international medical graduates and the
reasons underlying any significant differences.

The study also would determine the percentage of licensure
applications from domestic applicants that are approved and the
percentage of international medical graduate licensure applications
that are approved, and the reasons underlying any significant
differences.
