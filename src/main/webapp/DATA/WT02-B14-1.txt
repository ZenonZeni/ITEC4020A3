Prop. 187 Approved in California</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
California voters on November 8 voted 59 to 41 percent to approve Proposition
187, the "Save Our State'' Initiative.  Proposition 187 is an initiative
statute whose provisions remain state law unless disapproved by a two-thirds
vote of the California Legislature or by another initiative.<p>
<p>
A federal judge blocked the implementation of virtually all sections of Prop.
187 until at least December 14, citing "a balance of hardship that decidedly
tips in favor of" continuing to provide services to unauthorized immigrants.
Specifically, the judge said that the initiative may not be constitutional
because it does not provide due process, or a hearing before an individual is
denied benefits such as schooling or health care.  The judge's order prevents
California from announcing regulations implementing Prop. 187.  Only the
sections that impose penalties for making or using false documents were not
blocked.   <p>
<p>
 Prop. 187--Major Provisions<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 has five major sections.  First, it bars illegal aliens from the
state's public education systems from kindergarten through university, and
requires public educational institutions to begin verifying the legal status of
both students (effective January 1, 1995) and their parents (effective January
1, 1996).  <p>
<p>
California educational institutions today verify the residence but not the
legal status of pupils and students.  There are no tuition charges for K-12
education.  One of California's three higher education systems--the state
university system--charges resident illegal aliens lower in-state tuition,
while community colleges and UC charge them higher out-of state tuition.  <p>
<p>
Second, all providers of publicly-paid, non-emergency health care services must
verify the legal status of persons seeking services in order to be reimbursed
by the state of CA.<p>
<p>
Third, Prop. 187 requires that all persons seeking cash assistance and other
benefits verify their legal status before receiving benefits.  Fourth, all
service providers are required to report suspected illegal aliens to
California's Attorney General and to the INS, and police must determine the
legal status of persons arrested.  Fifth, the making and use of false documents
is now a state felony.<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 is a law whose sections can be implemented individually.  On November
9, Governor Wilson ordered that health services for prenatal care be stopped as
soon as possible, and that no more unauthorized aliens be enrolled in
state-reimbursed long-term health care programs (nursing home care).  <p>
<p>
The denial of public education to illegal alien children is likely to be the
most controversial section of Prop. 187 to be resolved by the courts.  The 1982
Plyler v Doe US Supreme Court decision declared that the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment protects everyone within a state's borders,
regardless of immigration status.  However, the court split 5-4 on whether
"equal protection" for illegal alien children included the same education
available to US-citizen children.  The majority emphasized that education is
especially needed to prevent the development of an underclass; the minority
argued that the court was making social policy.<p>
<p>
Public education is the most costly service used by illegal aliens in
California--providing education for the estimated 300,000 to 400,000 illegal
alien children in California schools accounts for about half of the estimated
$3 billion annual costs of services provided to the estimated 1.7 million
illegal aliens in California [California's state budget is $40 billion
annually].<p>
<p>
Several school districts joined in suits seeking to have the
denial-of-public-education part of Prop. 187 declared unconstitutional.  This
in turn prompted protests and, in a few instances, threats to initiate recall
campaigns against public officials who vote to spend taxpayer dollars to fight
Prop. 187.  In Los Angeles, where 51 percent of the voters supported Prop. 187,
there have been threats of recall campaigns against school board members who
voted to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn Prop. 187's public school
provisions.  The State Board of Education on November 21 ordered the
preparation of emergency regulations to implement Prop. 187 in the event that
the courts lift the injunction that currently prevents its implementation.<p>
<p>
There are several what-next scenarios.  Governor Wilson and some Prop. 187
supporters argue that unauthorized aliens, unable to receive public services,
will leave California.  Prop. 187 supporters hope to sponsor similar measures
in other states--Arizona, Texas and Florida, setting off, in a Prop. 13-like
fashion, a national effort to restrict the access of unauthorized immigrants to
public services.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Others predict that Prop. 187, plus stepped up labor law and border
enforcement, will primarily discourage additional unauthorized immigrants from
entering California.  They caution that Prop. 187 should be seen primarily as
an eligibility measure, not as a border management or labor market measure.<p>
<p>
Finally, there is the possibility that Prop. 187 will be largely a symbolic
measure, as was Prop. 63.  In 1986, three-fourths of California voters voted to
make English the state's "official language."  Prop. 63 has had little effect
on the manner in which public affairs are conducted in California.  If
immigration slows and California's economy recovers, there are some who predict
that Prop. 187 may be only symbolic.<p>

CA like anti-immigration law," Associated Press, November 28, 1994.<p>
<p>
 Prop. 187--The Campaign<p>
<p>
The Prop. 187 initiative began with a huge lead in opinion polls--it had a
37-point lead in July, and led among likely voters by 62 to 29 percent in
mid-September, 1994.  However, by early November, polls indicated that as many
likely voters opposed as supported SOS.  Most politicians and opinion leaders
argued that voters should reject Prop. 187 because it was too blunt an
instrument to deal with the complex issue of illegal immigration.  <p>
<p>
In the week before the election, Governor Wilson, who was re-elected with 55
percent of the vote, asserted that if SOS becomes law, he would require state
and local government employees to report suspected illegal aliens as required
by SOS.  California Attorney General Dan Lungren, who was also re-elected,
promised to develop emergency regulations to implement the initiative
immediately, but noted that there was no penalty for persons who do not report
suspected illegal aliens.  <p>
<p>
Wilson's campaign bought the only pro-SOS TV ads that were aired, while the
anti-SOS campaign used contributions from doctors and teachers to run anti-SOS
TV ads.  Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown ran out of money for TV ads at
the end of her campaign, and toured high school and college campuses, urging
students to work to defeat SOS.<p>
<p>
President Clinton argued against SOS.  According to Clinton, "it is not wrong
for you [Californians] to want to reduce illegal immigration.  And it is not
wrong for you to say it is a national responsibility."  Clinton said that "the
federal government should do more to help to stop illegal immigration and to
help California bear the costs of the illegal immigrants who are there," but
urged California voters to reject SOS and allow the federal government to "keep
working on what we're doing -- stiffening the border patrol, stiffening the
sanctions on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, stiffening our
ability to get illegal immigrants out of the workforce, increasing our ability
to deport people who have committed crimes who are illegal immigrants."
Clinton promised that the federal government would do more to "help California,
and other states, deal with incarceration, health and education costs of
illegal immigration."<p>
<p>
Some observers believe that Clinton may have reduced his chances to carry
California in the 1996 presidential race by campaigning so vigorously against
Prop. 187.  The "white male backlash" against illegal immigration may, these
observers say, also manifest itself in attacks on affirmative action and
similar programs.  A "California Civil Rights Initiative" that would eliminate
state affirmative action programs is already being prepared.<p>
<p>
The campaign's final days were marked by large numbers of Hispanic students
walking out of high school to protest SOS .  In the opinion of many Prop. 187
opponents, these protests were counterproductive--the Mexican flags they waved
reportedly convinced many undecided voters to support Prop. 187.<p>
<p>
The closing days of the campaign were also marked by charges of hypocrisy
between US Senate candidates Feinstein and Huffington.  Both took tough stands
against illegal immigration, and both charged that the other employed an
illegal alien maid.  Feinstein hired an illegal housekeeper in the early
1980s--before it was unlawful for a US employer to knowingly hire illegal alien
workers--and Huffington hired an illegal alien nanny in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, when such hiring was unlawful.  Some Huffington supporters alleged
that illegal aliens voted for Feinstein, who was narrowly re-elected.<p>
<p>
 Prop. 187--The Vote<p>
<p>
A majority of voters in 50 of California's 58 counties supported Prop. 187--the
exceptions were eight San Francisco Bay Area counties. According to exit polls,
64 percent of whites, 57 percent of Asian-Americans, 56 percent of
African-Americans, and 31 percent of Latinos voted in favor of Prop. 187.  Of
those voting in favor of Prop. 187, 78 percent agreed that "it sends a message
that needs to be sent" and 51 percent agreed that "it will force the federal
government to face the issue."  Some 40 percent of voters in one exit poll said
that they voted primarily because Prop. 187 was on the ballot.<p>
<p>
Of those voting against the measure, 60 percent agreed with the statement that
it "doesn't solve the problem" and about 40 percent agreed that  "it would
throw children out of school" and that "it is racist/anti-Latino."<p>
<p>
California's population is 57 percent white, 25 percent Latino, nine percent
Asian-American, and seven percent African American.  However, voters on
November 8 were 75 to 80 percent white, eight to 10 percent Latino, four to
five percent Asian-American, and 10 percent African-American.<p>
<p>
In Texas, only 35 percent of that state's 1.3 million registered Hispanic
voters<p>
cast ballots.  Hispanic voters supported Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann
Richards three to one over  Republican George W. Bush.  A study by Rhino
Information Systems concluded that the 1994 election will problably be the last
time Democrats can count on the Hispanic vote, as Hispanics are becoming more
conservative and more Republican.  Hispanic households with incomes over
$27,000 per year, for example, are more likely to vote Republican than
Democratic.  Exit polls in Texas found that Hispanics favor increased border
patrols to halt illegal immigration, but they oppose Prop. 187-like measures.
<p>
<p>
After Prop. 187-- Reactions<p>
<p>
Prop. 187 was based on the theory that changes in immigrant policy would affect
immigration policy--denying public services to unauthorized aliens would
discourage them from coming to the US.  Governor Wilson asserted that, since
public services were a magnet for at least some unauthorized aliens, denying
them services would encourage them to leave California.<p>
<p>
There were conflicting reports after November 8 about the behavior of
unauthorized immigrants.  Some hospitals and clinics reported sharply fewer
patients, and there were scattered reports that some of the estimated 300,000
to 400,000 unauthorized children in California schools were not going to
school. However, most health facilities and schools reported business as usual.
<p>
<p>
In one widely-reported case, illegal alien parents reportedly did not seek
medical care for their 12-year old son for fear of deportation to Mexico.  He
subsequently died.  Many service providers printed up materials in their
clients' language explaining that nothing had changed, and that patients and
students would not be asked to prove legal status before they received
services.  <p>
<p>
There were also numerous workshops on campuses, in churches, and in ethnic
communities in which speakers decried the passage of Prop. 187 and urged
opponents to get politically involved.  Some speakers denounced the "racism"
that, they asserted, motivated the vote, and some asserted that unauthorized
immigrants report "feeling hatred" in the streets.  <p>
<p>
Activists in several other states threatened to boycott California in
retaliation for the approval of Prop. 187.  Denver's mayor urged city residents
to boycott California, and the 110,000 member League of United Latin American
Citizens said that most of its December conference would be devoted to planning
a California boycott.  Several other Hispanic organizations announced that they
would not hold conventions in California, and some Hispanic leaders urged a
boycott of Disneyland to send a signal of their dissatisfaction with the
California vote.<p>
<p>
Denying public services to unauthorized aliens may not be easy because many
California households include persons with different legal statuses.  In
so-called "mixed families,"  family members include US citizens, legal
immigrants, and unauthorized persons.  Some fear that, if a US citizen or legal
immigrant seeks services to which they are entitled, they may expose an
unauthorized family member to immigration authorities.  To prevent such
detection, many public employees pledged not to comply with Prop. 187's
verification requirements, which have not yet gone into effect.<p>
<p>
Prominent Republicans scrapped over immigration.  Former cabinet secretaries
Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp attacked California Governor Wilson for supporting
Prop. 187.  They argued that immigrants are "natural Republicans" who support
low taxes and family values, and that Wilson risks turning the Republican party
into a party of protectionism and xenophobia.  According to Bennett, "its
assimilation, stupid"--meaning that the major problem is not the number or type
of immigrant entering the US.  Instead, Bennett argues that fears that
newcomers will not integrate into American society result from "too many"
programs such as bilingual education that, he argues, promotes
multiculturalism.<p>
<p>
Governor Wilson responded that the Republicans should hew to a law and order
line, and emphasize the sharp distinction between legal and illegal immigrants.
According to Wilson, the U.S. Border Patrol has a "Mission Impossible" task
trying to keep people from entering the US illegally, but the federal
government guarantees services and benefits "to everyone who succeeds in
evading the Border Patrol."<p>
<p>
Incoming House of Representatives Speaker Gingrich assured Wilson that he
believes the federal government should either fully reimburse states for the
costs they incur to provide services to illegal aliens, or eliminate the
requirement that the states provide services to them.<p>
<p>
The conservative magazine National Review weighed in on the side of Wilson,
asserting that the economic benefits of immigration are small, and that
immigration threatens national identity because it promotes multiculturalism
and the welfare state.<p>

<p>
After Prop. 187--Labor Law Enforcement<p>
<p>
In campaigning against SOS, the Clinton Administration asserted that policy
initiatives already underway would prove more effective at curbing illegal
immigration.  For example, on November 2, Labor Secretary Robert Reich asserted
that a Department of Labor crackdown against the employers of illegal aliens
would curb illegal immigration by denying them jobs.<p>
<p>
Reich announced that a Georgia onion grower and the farm labor contractor that
brought immigrant workers to his farm have been assessed a penalty of $1.2
million, including $675,000 in back wages, for paying farmworkers less than the
minimum wage and violating other farm labor protection laws.  According to
Reich, if US employers are unable to pay less than minimum wages, US workers
are more likely to be attracted to jobs now filled by illegal aliens.<p>
<p>
According to Reich, employers of illegal aliens also violate other laws, so
that penalizing employers who hire illegal aliens in order to pay below minimum
wages will help to curb illegal immigration.  In a sweep of 44 southern
California garment shops, 41, or 95 percent, were found to be violating federal
labor laws, and 40 percent of the workers in these shops were illegal aliens.
In 1993, DOL ordered employers to pay $3.1 million to underpaid workers, up 30
percent from 1992.<p>
<p>
Labor law enforcement has traditionally depended on complaints, because it is
too expensive to randomly check on the six million employers in the US and the
750,000 employers in California.  Some opponents of Prop. 187 argue that,
instead of putting more resources into verifying the legal status of applicants
for public services, we should put more effort into enforcing labor laws--if
employers could not "exploit" illegal alien workers, this argument runs,
illegal aliens would be less likely to be hired and thus less likely to come to
the US.   <p>

Scheer, "Instead of 187:  Enforcement of Labor Laws,"  Los Angeles Times,
November 20, 1994.  <p>
<p>
After Prop. 187--Hispanic Political Activism<p>
<p>
Hispanics are about 28 percent of California's 32 million people, but they are
just 15 percent of the state's eligible voters, and they cast only eight to
nine percent of the November 8 ballots.  Many are too young to vote, many
adults are not US citizens, and many Hispanic US citizens do not vote.  <p>
<p>
About 2.7 million illegal aliens were legalized in 1987-88 and, after a period
of temporary residence, most became legal immigrants after October 1988.  These
immigrants became eligible to become US citizens in October 1993.  As a result
of the Prop. 187 campaign, many school districts that offer citizenship classes
expect enrollment to jump--in the case of the Los Angeles School District, from
an average 500 to 25,000 by January 1995.  About 90,000 immigrants became US
citizens in Los Angeles in 1994, double the 1993 level--315,000 aliens became
naturalized US citizens in 1993.<p>
<p>
Hispanic high school and college students were especially active in opposing
SOS, walking out of class frequently in late October and early November.
Several commentators predicted that the activism born of opposition to SOS
would be a defining moment for Hispanics, turning them into a political force
in the same way that the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s encouraged Blacks
to participate in the political process.<p>
<p>
 After Prop. 187--US-Mexican Relations<p>
<p>
Many commentators were surprised by the active opposition of the Mexican
government to Prop. 187 , and the extensive coverage of the campaign for and
against Prop. 187 in the Mexican media.  In his final state-of-the-nation
address, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asserted that  "Mexico
affirms rejection of this xenophobic campaign, and will continue to act in
defense of the labor and human rights of our migrant workers,"  although he
acknowledged that Mexico could not hope to use economic sanctions against the
US or California to protest the approval of Prop. 187.  <p>
<p>
Ernesto Zedillo, who becomes Mexico's President on December 1, asserted during
his November trip to Washington, DC that Mexico "cannot object to legitimate
enforcement of US laws," but Mexico objects to "enforcement [that] might lead
to deprivation or violation of basic human rights.... [including] education and
health care."   The Mexican government promised to contribute attorneys and
funds to fight Proposition 187 in US courts. <p>
<p>
A week after SOS was enacted, President Salinas called on the US to discuss a
bilateral agreement that would permit Mexicans to work legally in the US under
a guestworker program. According to Salinas, the movement of Mexican workers to
the US "is inevitable, and it is better to order and regulate it than to
confront it with administrative measures that are not going to stop it because
the force of the economies is greater."  Governor Wilson, in a widely reported
November 18 speech to the Heritage Foundation, announced his support for a
program to import Mexican guestworkers.<p>
<p>
Knowledgeable US observers are skeptical, doubting that the Zedillo
Administration will make the enactment of what would be a controversial
guestworker program a top priority.  Indeed, some advise the Mexican government
that any guestworker proposal in the current US political climate could be
counterproductive.  The Mexican government does not want to have the US close
the safety valve on which several million of its citizens depend.  Mexico sees
no significant lessening of emigration pressures during the 1990s.<p>
<p>
The scenario for Mexico requesting and the US negotiating a guestworker program
in 1995 runs something like this.  Labor shortages develop, perhaps in the May
1995 Oregon strawberry harvest.  The INS meanwhile, concludes that Operation
Gatekeeper has succeeded in reducing the influx of illegal aliens, and
discusses ways to make legal border crossings easier.  US employers argue that
the current H-2 programs under which foreign workers may be imported to the US
in the event of labor shortages is too inflexible, and Mexico asks for a
bilateral program that recognizes its proximity and the tradition of US
employers hiring Mexican workers.<p>
<p>
In such a scenario, the discussion could very quickly shift from whether there
should be a guestworker program with Mexico to what kind of program.  Given
Prop. 187, it is already clear that any guestworkers would have little access
to US public services while here, and that a significant portion of their wages
are likely to be withheld to encourage their return. <p>
<p>
Several newspapers have suggested that the guestworker idea proposed by Salinas
would be the best way to engage in "immigration damage control."  The
Sacramento Bee, for example, editorialized on November 16, 1994 that a
guestworker program could protect Mexican workers who are temporarily in the US
and prove that California welcomes foreign workers who "play by the rules."<p>
<p>
A few days before the California election, protesters vandalized a McDonalds'
restaurant in Mexico City to protest the passage of Prop. 187.  California
exports goods and services worth about $7 billion annually to Mexico, and
several Mexicans urged a boycott of Disneyland to "send a message" to
California.  Some businessmen fear that Mexico may shun California firms when
it requests bids for projects to upgrade Mexico's infrastructure.<p>
<p>
Mexicans continue to be apprehended attempting entry into the US, about 700 per
night in San Diego.  Deputy Foreign Minister Rozenthal predicted that, as North
America integrates economically under NAFTA, "immigration is going to be the
No. 1 issue between the US and Mexico for the next several years."  <p>
<p>
Mexico's economy is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 1994, and US-Mexico
trade is booming, up about 20 percent in 1994.   US airlines in 1993 flew more
passengers to Latin America--15.8 million--than to Europe--15.6 million--or
across the Pacific--13.6 million.<p>
<p>
Between January and October 1994, Mexico deported 60,000 illegal aliens who
entered the country through its southern border.<p>
<p>
Immigration is likely to be a central issue during December's Summit of the
Americas in Miami.  Leaders of several Central American countries are expected
to tell President Clinton that their economies must grow faster in order to
stem the flow of illegal immigrants to the north.  Central American leaders
have begun an intensive lobbying effort to prevent the return of their citizens
after the passage of Prop. 187 and the threat of not renewing temporary
protected status for El Salvadorans(see related story on El Salvador). <p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
and Welfare Reform</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The combination of Prop. 187 in California and the return to power of
Republicans in Congress has made immigration a national issue.  Most observers
expect that immigration legislation will be enacted in 1995, so that
politicians running for re-election in 1996 can say that they "did something"
about immigration.  Most predications are that new efforts will be made to
reduce illegal immigration, and that more restrictions will be placed on the
availability of social services to legal and illegal immigrants.<p>
<p>
Immigration Proposals<p>
<p>
There were numerous immigration proposals introduced in Congress in 1993, but
Democrats reportedly fearful that "extreme" measures might be approved
allegedly failed to hold hearings or permit votes on them.  Among the proposals
being discussed are Governor Wilson's call to either eliminate or provide funds
for federal requirements that services be provided to illegal aliens, more
funds for the Border Patrol, and speedier deportations of especially criminal
aliens.  <p>
<p>
There may also be a battle over the number of legal immigrants admitted to the
US.  IMMACT in 1990 raised the number of legal immigrants expected annually
from about 500,000 to 800,000.  Senator Simpson (R-WY) has introduced
legislation to reduce the number of legal entries, and FAIR has called for a
"moratorium" on legal immigration.<p>
<p>
When Congress reconvenes in January, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and
Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) are expected to chair the immigration
subcommittees.  Both are expected to introduce legislation aimed at reducing
illegal immigration.<p>
<p>
Welfare Proposals<p>
<p>
House Republicans on November 21 introduced a proposal to consolidate a number
of federal social service program and cap spending on such programs, so that
those eligible may not get services if funds run out.  Three of the major
programs to be consolidated are Food Stamps, which spent $24 billion to assist
27.3 million people in 1993, WIC, which spent $3.1 billion to assist 6.2
million people, and school lunch programs, which spent $4.5 billion to provide
lunches for 25 million pupils every day.<p>
<p>
Republicans are also proposing changes in the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program, which denies benefits to unauthorized aliens, but not
their US-born and thus US-citizen children.  About five million
households--most headed by single mothers--received about $14 billion in
federal and $12 billion in state funds in 1994.<p>
<p>
The Republican proposal, known as the Personal Responsibility Act, would also
deny most federally-funded assistance to illegal aliens, and introduce new
restrictions on the access of legal aliens to social services.  Illegal aliens
would be barred from 60 federal programs--most health programs, including
migrant health center services, and from public housing, job training, and
homeless service programs.<p>
<p>
Aliens would continue to be eligible for emergency health services regardless
of their legal status, and refugees would continue to be eligible for federal
service programs.  However, legal immigrants would in many cases be ineligible
for services for at least five years after their entry into the US. <p>
<p>
Like many other federal assistance programs, spending on and participation in
the Food Stamp program exploded over the past two decades--in 1973, $2 billion
was spent to assist 12 million people.  About 69 percent of those believed
eligible for Food Stamps in 1992 participated--many of the elderly and working
poor who are eligible do not apply for Food Stamps.  To encourage eligible poor
persons to apply for Food Stamps, USDA, which administers the program, has made
grants to community organizations so that they can help people apply.<p>
<p>
Food Stamps are government coupons that are used like cash to buy groceries.
Individuals and families whose monthly incomes are below the poverty
line--about $1,600 for a family of four, or $800 for an individual, apply at
local welfare offices.  Applications are 10 to 40 pages long, depending on the
state and, after approval, coupons worth $1, $5, or $10 are distributed for
most types of food and drink, including basic foods as well as soft drinks and
candy, but not alcohol or cigarettes.  Applicants are fingerprinted, issued an
identification card, and required to file monthly reports on their incomes and
assets--having a car worth $4,550 or more disqualifies a person for Food
Stamps.  <p>
<p>
Over half of the recipients on whose behalf coupons are issued are children,
and another seven percent were persons 60 and older.  Food Stamps worth, on
average, $68 per person per month, or $170 per household, accounted for
one-fourth of a typical recipient's income.<p>
<p>
Most recipients receive Food Stamps for about seven months, but many reapply
within one year.  Some believe that the sharp drop in earnings for high-school
dropouts has contributed to the increased usage of Food Stamps--the real
earnings of male high-school dropouts fell from $22,858 in 1967 to $14,439 in
1989.  Others emphasize the rise in female-headed households.<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Operation
Gatekeeper in San Diego</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Operation Gatekeeper, initiated on October 1, 1994, has reduced the number of
aliens apprehended by 20 percent, to 25,000 in its first month.  The US Border
Patrol has assigned 200 additional agents to guard the 14 miles of US-Mexico
border south of San Diego, establishing three lines of agents to make it more
difficult for aliens seeking to enter the US illegally to avoid capture. <p>
<p>
But Gatekeeper had two other side effects--more aliens attempted to enter the
US illegally further east, and more aliens attempted entry with false
documents.  Apprehensions in inland sectors, such as Brown Field, rose 33
percent to 200 daily, and there was almost a 100-percent increase in the number
of aliens attempting to use false documents and enter through the legal port of
entry.  <p>
<p>
After illegal aliens are apprehended, they are fingerprinted and photographed,
held for a few hours, and then returned to Mexico.  Solo males, the majority of
those apprehended, are often taken 50 to 100 miles east of San Diego to make it
harder for them to return to Tijuana and attempt re-entry.<p>
<p>
In mid-November, the INS was apprehending about 700 aliens daily, down about 30
percent from earlier levels. The recidivist rate--the percentage of aliens who
had been apprehended previously--increased significantly, from less than 10
percent in early October to 20 to 30 percent by the end of November.  In order
to assess the effectiveness of Gatekeeper, the INS took 200 agents from the
border and re-opened the San Clemente checkpoint, which is 65 miles north of
the Mexican border.  <b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>As apprehensions drop in El Paso, Texas and San Diego, more aliens are
attempting entry in other areas, especially Arizona, ''California's side door,"
in the words of US Attorney General Reno.  The Border Patrol plans to launch
Operation Safeguard in Arizona, building fences and sending more agents to
apprehend aliens attempting entry.  <p>
<p>
In another article critical of the INS, a New York Times reporter took a day
cruise from Fort Lauderdale to Bermuda to demonstrate how easy it is for
illegal aliens to slip into the US.  The INS reportedly knows that such cruises
are being used to smuggle aliens and drugs into the US, but does not change its
inspection procedures for fear that cruise operations would be impeded.  Under
these procedures, non-US citizens are asked to come to a place on the ship as
it returns to the US for inspection, but there is no search for those who do
not present themselves for inspection. <p>

<p>
The Clinton Administration insisted in August, 1994 that the 30,000 Cubans and
20,000 Haitians who had left their countries in small boats and were held at
the US Naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba would  have to return to their homelands
in order to enter the US.  The intent was to discourage Cubans and Haitians
from arriving in southern Florida to request asylum.  <p>
<p>
Most of the Haitians by mid-November had returned to Haiti, but 30,000 Cubans
remain in Guantanamo.  Some want to return to Cuba, but US lawyers in Florida
have sued the federal government to prevent their return until lawyers have an
opportunity to advise them of their rights.  On November 3, a federal Court of
Appeals overturned a lower court's injunction and allowed the US to begin
returning to Cuba some of the 24,000 Cubans at the US Naval Base in Guantanamo
Bay.  Another 8,000 Cubans are being detained in Panama.  <p>
<p>
In defiance of the ban on coming directly from Guantanamo to the US, a federal
court in October 1994 permitted unaccompanied children under 18 and families
with such children to be brought from Guantanamo to the US.  On November 15,
the administration announced that it was likely to allow the 8,000 Cubans in
Guantanamo with children to come directly to the US rather than continue to
fight against the judge's order, citing the education needs of the children.
Cubans are eligible for 25,000 permanent immigrant visas in FY95; the
additional slots for children may raise the total to 30,000.<p>
<p>
On November 22, 1994, a federal judge applied this same reasoning to Haitian
children in Guantanamo, ordering that the 231 unaccompanied Haitian children
under 18 in Guantanamo be brought to the US for humanitarian reasons.  The
judge also ruled that legal counsel must be provided to all refugees who
request it in writing, and the names of all the Haitians still held in
Guantanamo must be given to refugee advocates. <p>

<a name="RTFToC6">End
of TPS for Salvadorans?</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Clinton Administration is considering allowing Temporary Protected Status
to expire for the 187,000 El Salvadorans who left the country for the US during
its 1980s civil war.  The TPS status of the Salvadorans was established in
IMMACT in 1990, and extended several times since then.  It is scheduled to
expire on December 31, 1994.  <p>
<p>
The Salvadoran government and US activists are pressuring the Clinton
Administration to extend TPS again.  Experts believe that the passage of Prop.
187 may influence the Clinton Administration's decision on another extension.
<p>
<p>
There may be as many as 400,000 Salvadorans in the Los Angeles area, and 1
million Salvadorans in the US.  Many would not be affected by the expiration of
TPS.  Salvadorans in the US remit $1 billion annually to El Salvador, the
country's number one source of foreign exchange.  <p>
<p>
If TPS is not extended, some Salvadorans are expected to return voluntarily,
while others are expected to apply for political asylum.  There is a backlog of
500,000 political asylum cases, which means that Salvadorans requesting asylum
would probably be given permission to work throughout the application process,
which could take several years.  Some Salvadorans may apply for permanent
residence status if they have been in the US for seven years and their
deportation would cause severe hardship to them or to a family member who is a
permanent resident or an American citizen. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canada
Reduces Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Canada announced on November 1 that it will reduce legal immigration from
250,000 in 1994 to between 190,000 and 215,000 from 1995 to 2000.  This
reduction broke a promise made in the 1993 campaign to maintain immigration at
one percent of the population, which would mean 290,000 immigrants annually.
The impetus behind the immigration policy changes is an effort by the
government to encourage immigrants "who (have) the skills and qualities to
establish themselves quickly... While limiting the number of immigrants that
are likely to depend upon government support." <p>
<p>
Under the new plan, 55 percent of all immigrants will be admitted in economic
categories, and 44 percent in family categories, and knowledge of English or
French will play a greater role in immigrant selection.  The stress on language
skills reportedly reflects governmental concern over the costs of teaching the
44 percent of all immigrants who do not speak English or French.  <p>
<p>
Canada is also considering requiring persons who sponsor immigrants to post a
bond or guarantee that the immigrants will not need public assistance after
their arrival.  About one in seven immigrants admitted under the family
categories is on welfare, at an annual cost of C$ 700 million.  Under the
previous rules,  immediate relatives of legal residents gained automatic
entrance.  The new regulations require that these relatives apply on their own
to gain legal status in Canada--thereby reducing the number of immigrants
admitted under the family classification.  <p>
<p>
Canada also suspended its investor-immigrant program" under which persons who
invest at least C$ 250,000 in Canada for five years can become immigrants while
reported abuses--investors withdrawing their money as soon as they receive
immigrant status--are investigated.<p>
<p>
Canada has recently increased immigration levels sharply, from 84,300 in 1985
to 245,800 in 1993.  In a 1993 poll, 47 percent of the respondents thought that
Canada was accepting too many immigrants, and one-third agreed with the
statement that immigrants take "too many" jobs away from Canadians.  The Reform
Party has called for no more than 150,000 immigrants annually.<p>
<p>
Members of Vancouver's Chinese community charge that the new immigration policy
is unfair.  Their concern is primarily with the new asylum/refugee
guidelines--claimants are required to have applied for status and resided in
Canada for a minimum of three years, plus present considerable documentation.
<p>
<p>
Currently, 4,000 Chinese have applied for refugee status in Canada-- as many as
2,800 may be sent home under the new policy.  The chairman of the Mainland
China Refugee Organization in Vancouver reports that of the 4,000, 92 percent
have found jobs and less than five percent receive public assistance, contrary
to the common public perception that Chinese refugees place a burden on
Canada's social services. <p>
<p>
The Canadian immigration policy changes were reported extensively in Asia.
Hong Kong is the leading country of origin, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of
all Canadian immigrants, followed by India and Taiwan.<p>

Alien Smuggling to US</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Alien smugglers have abandoned efforts to bring Chinese aliens illegally to the
US in ships, but they have stepped up their efforts to get them to US Caribbean
islands such as Puerto Rico, from which the Chinese can take domestic flights
to the US.  According to the INS, Chinese from Fujian in southeast China are
flown with many intermediate stops to the Dominican Republic, taken by small
boat across the 100 mile Mona Passage to Puerto Rico, and then flown to New
York City on domestic or internal US flights.<p>
<p>
The smuggling of Chinese is qualitatively different from the more common
smuggling of Mexican aliens into the US.  The Chinese are smuggled in groups of
up to 300, and they pay $20,000 to $30,000 each, making each "load" worth up to
$1 million.  Mexicans, by contrast, are more often smuggled in vans that hold
up to 20 people and, at $300 per alien, a van "load" can be worth $6,000.  In
1993, about 2,500 Chinese were apprehended trying to enter the US illegally.<p>
<p>
At an International Organization for Migration conference in Geneva this month,
70 nations discussed alien smuggling.  An INS associate commissioner for the
INS reported that cooperation between China and the US in tracking smuggling
gangs has meant that since June, not one ship has been detected trying to
smuggle Chinese immigrants to the US. <p>

At the end of 1993, there were 6.9 million foreigners in Germany, making
foreigners 8.5 percent of the population. Almost all--97 percent--lived in the
former West Germany, and about two million were refugees and asylum seekers.<p>
<p>
About 22 percent of these foreigners are from other EU member nations, 27
percent are Turks, and 14 percent are from the ex-Yugoslavia.  About 13 percent
of the 700,000 births in Germany in 1993 were to foreigners; the children take
the nationality of their parents.<p>
<p>
Chancellor Kohl's government, which was re-elected on November 15 with one vote
to spare, announced a nine-point program to guide the country during the next
four years.  The program was worked out with coalition-member FDP (Free
Democratic Party). A number of items were shelved during the talks to avoid
controversy, including dual citizenship for adult foreigners.  The program did
pledge to work for a new "children's nationality" with full citizenship rights
for children born in Germany of at least one foreign parent who have lived in
Germany for at least 10 years.<p>
<p>
The head of the Federal Office for Foreigners' Issues, Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, wants children of foreigners born in Germany to have dual
citizenship from birth to age 18, at which time they could choose their
nationality.  Schmalz-Jacobsen said that Kohl's proposals for children's
nationality would be "impossible to administer,"  because of the difficulty of
determining how long a person had lived in Germany. <p>

Germans also elected the first Parliament member of Turkish origin.  Cem
Oezdemir, 28, is a social worker and a member of the Green Party born of
Turkish parents in Germany, and naturalized as a German citizen in 1984.  His

Bosnian families fleeing the civil war in their own country have in some cases
been physically separated by European governments intent on limiting
immigration.  In most European countries, fewer than 10 percent of those
seeking asylum are recognized as refugees, versus about 20 percent in the US.
<p>
<p>
In a profile of a Bosnian family that was fortunate enough to have relatives
settled in Switzerland, the wife and children got safe haven there, but the
husband arrived in the UK, where the British refused to permit the family to
unite.  The family eventually reunited in Switzerland, where they live in
government-supplied housing and have temporary visas.<p>
<p>
In Britain, about 20 Bosnians secured Croatian passports in order to flee the
war.  Though Bosnian by birth, the British Home Office has told them that since
they hold Croatian passports, they must return to that country.  Last year, the
Croatian government was providing passports to anyone who could prove that they
were Christian, and many Bosnians obtained Croatian passports to escape the
civil war.  <p>
<p>
There are an estimated 8,000 people from the former Yugoslavia in Britain, and
370 of their applications for political asylum have been processed.  Five
persons were awarded refugee status and 255 denied.  The rest have been given a
year's leave to remain in Britain. <p>
<p>
With Bosnia likely to be carved into a mosaic of fiefdoms separated by
ethnicity and religion, many of the Bosnians currently "tolerated" in Western
Europe will find their homes in "hostile" territory.  They will then face the
choice of continuing to live--not always welcomed--in Western Europe, or
returning to perhaps new areas within their former countries to rebuild.<p>

According to the Russian Federal Migration Service, there are over two million

asylum seekers from outside the former Soviet Union.  The FMS predicts that an

Russia will return in the next two years.  <p>

have left potential refugees stranded in Russia.  <p>

Refugees in Russia receive little assistance from the UNHCR or FMS.  The claims

Workers in Japan</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Japanese Labor Ministry released a report on the legal half of the
estimated 600,000 foreign workers in the country.  In the year ending June 1,
1994, the number of foreign workers hired directly by Japanese manufacturers
fell, but the number of manufacturers hiring foreign workers increased 10-fold,
from 1,300 to 13,000.  The number of foreign workers hired in construction,
transport, and services rose.<p>
<p>
Based on a survey of 14,200 companies with 130,000 foreign workers--of whom 28
percent were hired through labor contractors--the ministry reported that the
number of foreign workers employed legally in manufacturing fell by seven
percent between June, 1993 and June, 1994.  The number of foreign workers hired
by construction firms rose by 17 percent, by transport firms 10 percent, and by
service firms four percent.<p>
<p>
Large companies shed foreign workers, while small firms added foreign workers.
In corporations with more than 1,000 employees, the number of foreign workers
dropped 24, but the number of foreign workers rose by 18 percent at companies
with five to 29 employees.<p>
<p>
Of the 130,000 foreign workers reported by these employers, 60 percent were
Central and South Americans, many of whom were of Japanese descent.  Another 18
percent each were East Asians and North Americans.<p>
<p>
Chinese living illegally in Japan have apparently become sophisticated forgers
of the immigration stamps needed for legal ID cards.  For 20,000 to 60,000 yen
(US$ 200 to $600), false ID cards can be purchased.  It is common for forgers
to stamp on the alien's tourist visa "Zairyu Kikan Shinseichu" (extension under
application), which is plausible given the backlog at Japan's Immigration
Bureau. .<p>
There is also a lively business of "renting" valid passports, on which pictures
are changed.  Illegal "boat people" from China's Fujian province who arrive
without papers are believed to be the main buyers of false documents.<p>
<p>
Police arrested 13 Peruvians in northern Japan in November for overstaying
their tourist visas by one-half to almost three years.  All were employed by
Japanese firms that manufacture electrical equipment.<p>
<p>
In a new book, Japan's 'Guestworkers:' Issues and Public Policies, published by
the University of Tokyo Press, author Haruo Shimada says that Japan should
accept the need for foreign workers and enact labor laws that better protect
them.  According to Shimada, " large numbers of foreign workers and their
families are already in the country and have begun to settle on a permanent
basis." <p>
<p>
Shimada reports that in 1992, 110,000 foreigners entered Japan to work, and
that an average 85,000 were in the Japanese workforce.  In addition, there were
43,000 trainees, plus 27,000 language students who are allowed to work part
time.  About 149,000 Latin Americans of Japanese descent entered Japan.  There
are also about 300,000 foreigners who entered Japan as tourists, overstayed
their visas, and went to work.<p>

immigration offenses.  There are at least 120,000 Filipinos living in Sabah,
and the Philippines and Malaysia have agreed to issue border crossing cards to
Filipinos in the area.<p>
<p>
In the Philippines, it was announced that the government was establishing a new
agency to formulate a policy on overseas contract workers (OCWs).  President
Ramos has asked the Departments of Foreign Affairs and labor to develop a<p>
plan to reduce the deployment of unskilled workers, such as maids.<p>
<p>
In Hong Kong, the 20 Filipino churches are being asked to investigate the
working conditions of maids.  Maids often pay 35,000 to 40,000 pesos to
employment agencies, who often hold their passports and work permits until
their "loan" is paid off.  If the maid finds herself in an abusive situation,
she is unable to get help from the agency holding the loan, and she may find it
hard to obtain a new job within the two-week period allowed by Hong Kong
authorities for aliens to be jobless in the territory. <p>
<p>
Malaysia's labor shortages are reportedly beginning to affect its
competitiveness.  The labor shortage is attributed to the Malaysian
government's slowing the influx of foreign workers.  The most severe labor
shortages are in the major export and growth industries, such as oleochemicals,
machinery and engineering, textiles, electronics and electrical, plastics,
information technology, wood and chemicals.  <p>
<p>
A Malaysian government freeze on foreign workers early in 1994 came at a time
that the manufacturing sector was experiencing a shortage of local workers.
The government is trying to encourage the private sector to move away from
labor-intensive production in favor of higher value-added industries. <p>

Education and Migration in Asia</a></h2>
There are fears throughout Asia that rapid economic growth is leaving them
short of educated manpower--in Thailand, for example, there are projections
that in the year 2000, the country will need 28,000 science and engineering
graduates annually, and produce only 14,000.<p>
<p>
It should be easy to get more graduates in a region in which there is respect
for education and a belief that education is the ticket to a secure economic
future produce more graduates.  Singapore provides an example of a country
that, in 1991, spent $322 per person on higher education, and developed several
world-class research institutes.  The key is reportedly not the people, many of
whom were trained and employed in top research labs in North American and
Western Europe, but rather the infrastructure to support research efforts in
Asia.<p>
<p>
However, there is often a tension between the needs of research and politics.
Higher education in China provides an example.  China has 124 million primary
school pupils, but only 40 percent pass the test that enables them to go to
junior high school despite often intense parental efforts to give their
children advantages in the competition to move up to the next level of
education.  <p>
<p>
About one in eight Chinese pupils goes to high school, and only three or four
percent pass entrance exams to win one of the 2.5 million places in Chinese
universities.  In 1992, Chinese educational spending was equivalent to about
three percent of GDP, half the level of Malaysia.  Many Chinese schools
strapped for money are imposing tuitions of $100 to $200, equivalent to half an
urban worker's annual salary.  However, 80 percent of all China's professors
are over 55, suggesting a hiring challenge.<p>

Foreign Workers in Taiwan</a>

In mid-November, Taiwan approved major investment projects proposed by 11

workers on the projects.  Firms undertaking investment projects worth over NT$
200 million are permitted to import foreign workers until 30 percent of their
workforces on these projects are foreigners. (See Migration News, November,
1994.)<p>
<p>
On October 20, Taiwan's  Employment and Service Act was amended to increase
fines for illegally hiring  foreign workers to up to three years in jail or a
maximum NT$ 300,000 fine.  Taiwanese employers reported that 850 legitimately
hired workers ran away from their jobs in January 1994, and 3495 in September.
Most of these foreign workers had reached the two year maximum on their work
permits.  Current penalties are deportation for runaway workers and fines for

Immigration Advice on Internet</a></h2>
The Canadian immigration office in Hong Kong attracted 650 immigration
applications on one day after it was announced that the number of immigrants to
be accepted in Canada in 1995 would be reduced from the current level of
250,000 to between 190,000 and 215,000.  It was feared that increasing the
emphasis on economic skills and knowledge of English or French would reduce the
chances of Hong Kong residents to migrate there.  <p>
<p>
Canada is also considering a separate category and quota for parents and
grandparents, and imposing a legally enforceable bond on persons who sponsor
immigrants.<p>
<p>
In Hong Kong, the Canadian government has established a bulletin board on the
Internet ''misc. immigration. canada'' to provide advice on how to migrate to
Canada.  Canada granted about 31,000 immigration visas to Hong Kong residents
in 1993, and they were 21 percent of all immigrants to Canada in July 1994.<p>

Cambodian-Vietnamese Dispute</a></h2>

Vietnam and Cambodia held talks to resolve the issue of Vietnam  interfering

Cambodia-bound ships have been halted since October after failing to get

Cambodia enacted an immigration law on August 26, 1994 that seeks to discourage

<a name="RTFToC18">Citizenship
and Islam in Australia</a></h2>
Using the slogan--Australian Citizenship - Welcome to Our Family-- Australian
Prime Minister Paul Keating on November 4 launched a campaign to encourage the
1.1 million eligible immigrants--57 percent from the United Kingdom and New
Zealand-- to become Australian citizens.  About 120,000 immigrants became
Australian citizens in 1993.<p>
<p>
To become an Australian citizen, persons need to have lived two years of the
past five years in Australia, including 12 months' residence during the 24
months before applying.  Australia permits dual citizenship only if the country
of birth allows dual citizenship, as in the case of Irish or Italian
immigrants.  About 40 percent of all Australians were born abroad or had
parents who were not born in Australia.  <p>
In early November, Australia administered an English language test to 7,000
aliens requesting refugee status in the country; those who pass the test may be
able to immigrate under economic categories.  On November 1, 1993, Australia
granted permanent residence status to the 19,000 Chinese who were in the
country when the Beijing massacre occurred on June 4, 1989.  Another 9000
spouses and children later joined them in Australia.<p>
<p>
On November 1, 1993,&nbsp;there were 20,000 applicants for asylum in Australia,
and Australia created a new category of permanent resident.  The intent was to
deal with remaining Chinese students and dependents and foreign students who
paid tuition to get to Australia, and then went to work and overstayed their
visas.  Many of those required to take the test protested, but the government
responded that they came to Australia in the first place to learn English.<p>
<p>
There are 147,507 Muslims from 67 countries--led by Lebanon and Turkey--in
Australia.  Most are under 25, and one-third were born in Australia.  Half live
in Sydney, and another one-third live in Melbourne.  The number of Muslims in
Australia almost doubled between 1981 and 1991, and Australia now has 57
mosques.<p>
<p>
Almost half of the Muslims interviewed in one study complained of
discrimination, especially women wearing the hijab, or head covering, while
trying to get jobs.  A Racial Hatred Bill is expected to be introduced in
Canberra to create an agency to hear complaints of public behavior against
persons because of their race, color or ethnic origin.<p>

Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus praised Muslim immigrants, and a study
described their presence as another example of "Australia's transition to
becoming a multicultural society."<p>

Since then, about 24,000 Palestinian day laborers have been given permission to

There were 110,000 Palestinians working in Israel before the uprisings that

Controlling Illegal Immigration:  A Global Perspective.  Available from
Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, 94305.   Paperback and
Hardbound. <p>
<p>
This book provides comparative perspectives on how nine industrialized
countries have tried to deal with illegal immigration and refugee flows.  The
American authors and their generally native commentators explore two
hypotheses:  the convergence hypothesis that the industrial countries that are
today net immigration areas use increasingly similar policy <u>instruments</u>
to regulate immigration, and the gap hypothesis, which asserts that the
<u>gap</u> between the immigration policy goals and outcomes is growing in all
industrial countries.  The goals-outcomes gap helps to explain the common
anti-immigrant mood.  <p>
<p>
While the authors agree that there is a growing gap between immigration goals
and outcomes in each country, they do not necessarily agree on the most
important factors that cause it.  Several authors emphasize the importance of
demand-pull factors--the idea that, even in periods of high unemployment, there
are jobs to be filled by unskilled immigrants, and employers are able to
frustrate effective controls meant to keep out such immigrants.  Other authors
focus on supply-push pressures that encourage migrants to leave rural Mexico,
Turkey, and other sending countries; they see rising emigration pressures, plus
the networks or bridges that have made it ever easier for migrants to cross
borders, obtain jobs, and stay, as the primary determinants of unwanted
migration.<p>
<p>
There is little disagreement that the industrialized countries that embraced in
the 1950s and 1960s the notion that they could borrow labor temporarily from
their poorer neighbors did not appreciate the fact that what was once seen as
simple economic transaction has become a complex socio-political issue, raising
fundamental questions, such as who are we and whom do we invite to join our
nation-state?  The industrial nations generally failed at least once in their
quest for control over illegal immigration, and they now stand on the threshold
of an era in which streams of immigration have the potential to become less
manageable rivers of people.  <p>
<p>
Politicians are responding to the anti-immigrant moods of most industrial
countries by discussing the importance of dealing with the root causes of
unwanted immigration, and then, in the familiar mode of the man with the hammer
who perceives all problems to be nails, these mostly lawyers who extended
rights to citizens and aliens are beginning to roll them back in an effort to
reassert control over immigration.  These rights rollbacks are having at least
initial successes:  asylum applications are down sharply in Germany in 1994
compared to 1993, and the US "Hold-the-Line" approach of flooding the border
with border control agents appears to keep out unauthorized short-distance
migrants.  However, such control measures have in the past proven to have their
desired effects for only a short time, so that, viewed over a longer time
horizon, they appear to be only symbolic steps designed to appease
anti-immigrant sentiment.<p>
<p>
This book explains how the immigration problem evolved in the various
industrial countries, how it is defined today, and how migration streams are
likely to evolve.  It does not prescribe what the countries studied should do,
but the theme running through many of the chapters is that no country is
satisfied with its current immigration control policies.  More telling,
perhaps, is that there seems to be no success story that industrial countries
can adapt to their own situations, as in environmental or urban planning or in
labor market policies.  Rather than prescribing the optimal policies, this book
illustrates the consequences of alternative policy paths.<p>

and about 4 in 5 were tourists.  Some 1.3 million illegal aliens were
apprehended.<p>
<p>
PRAs in 1993 included 255,000 immediate relatives of US citizens and 227,000
family-sponsored preference immigrants subject to numerical limitation.
Another 146,000 PRAs were admitted under the employment preferences.  Finally,
another 160,000 aliens were admitted outside the preference quotas, including
24,000 persons who were legalized in 1987-88, 127,000 refugees, and others,
including 16,000 parolees from the ex-Soviet Union and Indochina.<p>

Self-Employment.  NBER Working Paper 4791.<p>
<p>
About 10 million Americans are self employed, and about 10 million US workers
were born in another country.  Rates of self-employment vary  by country of
origin--among immigrant men, almost 29 percent of the Israeli men were self
employed in 1990, versus only 3 percent for Laotian men.  Immigrant men with
high self-employment rates included Russians (25 percent), Greeks (23 percent),
and Cubans (16 percent).  Low self-employment rates were reported by Puerto
Ricans (4 percent) and Filipinos (5 percent).<p>
<p>
There are also distinct differences in the type of self employment.
Self-employed Russians, for example, tended to offer construction, health, or
legal and accounting services, while Chinese immigrants were  more likely to
own restaurants and Koreans small retail stores.<p>

This book is billed as an effort to predict "where technology, demographics and
history will take America and the world in the next 30 years."  Its many
assertions/predictions include "globalization causes the worldwide divisions of
have and have-not countries to be mirrored within the borders of even the
richest nations." (p20), since workers who compete in tradable goods will have
to  compete directly with the goods and services produced by lower wage workers
in stable developing nations, and other workers will have to compete with cheap
immigrant labor.<p>
