ARE BROADCASTERS FALLING BEHIND IN THE RACE TO HDTV?

     As HDTV nears a critical juncture--the beginning of the FCC
terrestrial transmission tests--there is concern that
broadcasters are falling behind the satellite and cable TV
industries in the race for HDTV.
     Satellites already have carried HDTV, and cable just
announced plans for demonstration transmissions of the
technology.  Meanwhile, broadcasters have been forced to wait out
the FCC testing process.
     HDTV REPORT editor Charlotte Wolter polled leading experts
on whether the broadcast industry can keep pace as HDTV picks up
steam.  They said the cost of HDTV will be a significant problem
for broadcasters, more than for cable or satellites, which can
get the technology on the air more quickly and inexpensively.
     The good news is that broadcasters also are developing
models for the introduction of HDTV that will keep costs within
reach of most local stations and keep the industry in the HDTV
race.
     "Right now broadcasters face a tremendous cost imbalance
relative to cable companies," said Lynn Claudy, National
Association of Broadcasters (NAB) director, advanced engineering
and technology.  "A broadcaster is inherently a local beast and
ultimately, any HDTV service would incorporate some local element
of production."
     "Cable has an advantage in that they don't need a
transmitter for every headend," said Julius Barnathan, senior
vice president for advanced technology and strategic planning,
Capital Cities/ABC, "But...they would need new boxes that are
smart....Nobody gets off cheap."
     While cable wins a short-term public relations coup from the
HDTV initiative, the real impact, said James McKinney, chairman
of the Advanced Television Systems Committee, is to "reinforce
the absolute certainty that [broadcasters] must have a good
system."  In the past, he said, broadcasters assumed a standard
could be "good enough--not as good as MUSE or what we see
elsewhere--but good enough.  But this means they have to pick
something that is a golden standard, and if they don't, others
will be ahead of them."
     The cable demonstrations also have raised the specter that
broadcasters will be left behind.  "That's a significant portion
of the motivation to move ahead," said Howard Miller, senior vice
president of broadcast operations and engineering for PBS.  But
with its role in the FCC process, "Is cable going to march off
ahead," Miller asked.  "Not unless broadcasting chooses not to do
it."

Broadcasters Must Find Whether There Is a Business in HDTV

     Given its inherent cost disadvantage, broadcasters have to
decide how to compete in HDTV.  "Is terrestrial going to be [like
AM radio after FM appeared] and find a different local business,
or will it be able to continue to play competitively in this new
arena," asked Joseph Flaherty, vice president and general
manager, engineering development, for CBS.  "Certainly cable,
[direct broadcast satellite], home video and fiber can play in
the game."
     "The question remains, how do broadcasters secure profit out
of it," said McKinney.  "When color came on, broadcasters charged
extra if someone wanted a commercial in color."  Miller agreed,
"From the station standpoint, it's a very basic question: Is
there any revenue potential with this technology?  They have to
think very carefully about whether they will make the
investment."
     Nevertheless, there is optimism that conversion is possible.
During this week's NAB National Show, Flaherty will present a
detailed study that will state that stations have a wide range of
choices for conversion.  It will suggest a 4-step process,
starting with signal pass-through for as little as $1 million
--with digital HDTV.  Next, stations can add local 16:9
broadcasts with a wide- screen version of today's TV, then a
lower-quality version of the FCC standard, then finally full
HDTV.  Studio equipment, the most costly item, can be phased in
over 5-7 years on regular replacement schedules.
     Economies also can be found in studio conversion, said
Merrill Weiss, managing director, advanced television systems,
for NBC.  Serial digital systems now finding their way into
studios could be adapted for HDTV, he said, if the right choices
are made in data rates and formats.
     Each station, Flaherty emphasized, will find a schedule
appropriate for its market.  "Large markets have funds to do it
first and tend to be in tougher competitive environments.
Smaller stations do it later, and even in major markets they
don't do everything at once."
     Flaherty believes an industry that made the transition from
black and white to color can handle HDTV.  "People worried about
cost, and it took time for smaller stations, but it would be hard
to find a black-and-white station today.
It's not simple, not cheap; it's very difficult and takes good
business judgment, but we've done it before," he added.

HDTV DISPLAYS:  MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FOR
CONSUMER MARKET

     As the HDTV broadcast picture begins to clear,it has become
more and more apparent that a criticalelement is missing:
low-cost, large-screen displays of 40 inches diagonally or
larger.  The lack of suitable displays is a serious bottleneck in
the development of a consumer market for HDTV.
     Many are convinced the HDTV experience is apparent only on
screens 40 inches across and larger.  Large displays are
"absolutely" necessary, said Julius Barnathan of ABC.  "Let the
[40-inch CRT] stick out into an apartment," he joked, adding,
"This is a problem, a fundamental problem."
     "Until we have large screens, the American public is not
going to be swayed," said the NAB's Lynn Claudy.  "It has
to...really slap them in the face. That's possible with large
screens--4, 5, 6 feet."
     But CRTs are difficult to make that size and would be too
bulky for the average home.  "Sony made a 46-inch [CRT], but it
weighs hundreds of pounds. That size will be the end for tubes,"
said D. Joseph Donahue, senior vice president, technology and
business development for Thomson Consumer Electronics. "Today no
one knows how to make large flat panels [that size]--never mind
the economics, just to demonstrate."  The industry "might see
demos this decade," he said, but not flat-screen products.
     Some HDTV displays based on current technology will sell.
"The 27-inch [variety] is the most popular, at 4:3 [aspect
ratio]," said James McKinney of the Advanced Television Systems
Committee.  "What's important is screen height.  If you take the
same height and convert it to high-definition [9:16 aspect
ratio], you come out to 37-38 inches diagonally [a size CRTs can
manage]."
     "High-definition makes as much sense in a 17-as in a 40-inch
set," said Greg DePriest, vice president, advanced TV technology
and strategic planning for Toshiba America.  "I don't think HDTV
means the end of 17-or 22-inch sets."

**SPECIAL REPORT--AN INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD WILEY**

     HDTV REPORT editors David Bross and Britton Manasco sat down
recently with the Chairman of the FCC Advisory Committee on
Advanced Television Service, Richard Wiley, for a wide-ranging
interview on the state of the global HDTV industry and the FCC's
efforts in moving toward selecting a U.S. HDTV standard.  The
interview was conducted at Wiley's Washington, D.C., law firm
Wiley, Rein & Fielding.  Wiley was the chairman of the FCC from
1974-77 and also served as an FCC commissioner and general
counsel.  Here's what he had to say:

HDTV REPORT:  Why has the United States opted for a mandated
HDTV standard rather than having one evolve naturally in the
marketplace?

Wiley:  I can only speculate, to some extent, because it is,
obviously, an FCC determination.  They set up the advisory
committee.  I think the reason is we're dealing here with a very
important decision for the country.  When you look at when the
last television standard was set--in the 1940s--you realize
whatever decision you make is going to be an important one.  I
think it's one in which the government feels it wants the private
sector input, but it ultimately needs to make the decision
itself.  I think this commission, unlike decisions that past
commissions might have made, wants to make that decision.  I
think it's a very interesting process and hopefully will be an
effective one.
              One thing it clearly has done is to stimulate
private sector activity in this area.  Before the fall of 1987,
I'm not aware of very much that was going on in HDTV in this
country.  We've got some very impressive U.S. proponents, as well
as foreign proponents, and we have well over 500
people drawn from various private sector companies, many of them
U.S.-based, who are active in the work of the advisory committee.
And I think that out of this may come a very good decision.

HDTV REPORT:  If American-based companies knew that their
foreign-based competitors were active in HDTV prior to 1987, why
the lack of movement domestically?  Were there barriers to HDTV
development?

Wiley:  No, I don't think so.  Of course, we have not been as
big a factor in the television manufacturing business as we might
have, but I think that this effort has, perhaps, renewed some of
our resolve in this area.  It brought out some of our
technological prowess, which is good.  But I can't tell you why
we weren't involved in it before.  To some extent, we may have
leapfrogged some of the activity that has gone on abroad--if
digital-based technologies prove they will actually work.

HDTV REPORT:  Are developments in compression driving the
recent push toward digitally based HDTV systems?

Wiley:  Yes, I think there have been, as I understand it, some
compression breakthroughs that companies have developed.  I think
the stimulus of General Instrument coming forth with a digital
system is good.  I think it drove some of the other proponents to
examine what they are doing and to see whether or not they could
use that same technology to bring their product to the
marketplace.             A year and a half ago we had a meeting
in Chairman Sikes' office with a number of engineers in this
field and they felt that terrestrial broadcasting, digitally, was
not possible--perhaps not even in this century.
HDTV REPORT:  Is it taken as a given by the FCC that the
continued profitability of the local broadcaster is in the public
interest?

Wiley:  No, I don't think that's the basis on which the
commission decided to pursue terrestrial broadcasting.  The
commission has not said that it is trying to protect broadcasting
profitability or even the industry itself.  I think the
commission's theory is that terrestrial transmission may be the
quickest and the least expensive way to bring advanced television
service to the American people.
     At the same time, we're not trying to hold back other
technologies.  I'd encourage cable to work very closely with
broadcasting so that we can have an advanced television system
that will work for both broadcasting and cable.  And I've been
very pleased that the 2 industries have been working together in
harmony on this through the Advanced Television Test Center and
CableLabs.
     I think that's one of the great advantages of our system
here.  Also we've encouraged, and had a working party look at,
alternative media.  If there is a direct broadcast satellite
system in this country, it can go right ahead and provide
advanced television service.
     But the point is, we don't have that currently in this
country.  But we all have television sets.  We do have a very
ubiquitous broadcast and cable system in this country and I think
the commission has rightly determined that this is the best way
to proceed for now.  Clearly, Japan and Western Europe are
looking at a DBS service for HDTV and that should be technically
possible here as well.
     Nothing the advisory committee is doing should impede [DBS].
I think that's an advancement in the state of the art.  If it
happens, so be it.  There's one thing I would like to add,
however.  We are a little different than Japan.  We have 4 time
zones in this country--a very geographically large country.  The
FCC also has a commitment to localism in broadcasting and I think
that fits naturally with [its call for] a terrestrial means of
transmission.  But I don't see it as a protectionist view for
broadcasting, so I support what they've done.

HDTV REPORT:  Recently, Chairman Sikes has expressed concern
over the speed at which the test committee is moving--what is the
status of testing?

Wiley:  Well, I agree with him, of course, that we want to keep
pushing the process.  Yes, we've had delays, but I think the
theory has been that we're going to keep setting deadlines and
then back off the deadlines if there are developments that
necessitate it.  There are a number of reasons why we've
experienced delays.  Number one, the proponents have changed
their designs and their formats.  Four of them have gone to
digital modes.  They would not have been ready to be tested under
the old schedule.  And I think it's in the public interest to
have had that delay and I think Al Sikes agrees.
     Number 2, there have been delays in the delivery of
equipment to the advanced television test center.  The format
converter, manufactured by Techtronics, has been delayed.  I'm
not saying that in criticism of that company, because it is a
very complex product, but I think it is characteristic of the
problems that we are running into.
     We're sailing on a sea that has never been charted before.
The equipment that we are utilizing to test these systems has
never been made before.  The proponents themselves have never
been there.  So, I think some delay has probably been inevitable
and probably beneficial.  The bad news is there has been a delay.
The good news is there has been a delay.
* Editor's Note: Look for more coverage of our interview with
Richard Wiley in the next news-filled issue of HDTV REPORT.

EVERYONE'S DOING IT:  HDTV SOFTWARE DEMAND HEATING
UP; INVESTORS EYE PROFITS

     This will be the year the tremendous investments that HDTV
production pioneers made inexpensive and untried equipment will
begin to pay off.  There finally will be enough demand for HDTV
production to provide a return to the production houses that have
geared up for HDTV, industry sources told us.
     "It's really picking up this year," said Club Theater
Network President Ron Ratner, whose company has an HDTV
production studio, including an HDTV telecine.  "I think we did
more in January and February in high-definition than all last
year, billable, not giving away stuff anymore."
     Some organizations that are potential buyers of HDTV
      programming are:

     * NHK: The Japanese national broadcaster plans to up its DBS
      broadcasts to
      6, and some say 8, hours per day by the end of the year.
       Movies converted
      to HDTV will take up a significant chunk of that time, but
      the broadcaster
      also has ordered travelogues, music programming and sports;
     * PBS: Public broadcasting is committed to demonstrating
      advanced television for the public, said Senior Vice
      President Howard Miller, but it currently is struggling to
      assemble equipment donations.  However, PBS plans
      original HDTV productions, probably in music, for 1991;
     * Cable: It is not clear if CableLabs' HDTV demonstration
      will include original programming, but it is linked to
      Scientific-Atlanta's HDTV production/transmission venture
      with Captain New York, which will produce and transmit
      special-event programming via satellite;
     *Europe: The advent of B-MAC broadcasts will require wide
     aspect-ratio programming, some of which will be original
     programming; and
     * Non-broadcast markets: There is growing demand in special
     effects for films and projection HDTV for amusement parks
     and public displays.

     While producers are beginning a wider variety of projects,
most of the pioneering HDTV producers are seeing an increase in
projects, not just for NHK but for other buyers as well,
including:

     * Zbig Vision Ltd.: NHK just commissioned a documentary
     called "Manhattan"
      and another called "Washington," for a total of one hour of
     HDTV.  Zbig
      also will produce a one-hour special on Franz Kafka for a
     French company,
      Telemax.  The show will be shot on a sound stage with
     actors inserted into
      a set of miniatures and models reproducing Prague of
      Kafka's time;
     * Captain New York: President David Niles said his company
     has done fashion shows for NHK, as well as music,
      travelogues, ballet,opera--universally acceptable
      programming.  An adventuresome project has been to film
      comedian Jackie Mason in HDTV.  He added, "There is serious
     talk of networks of movie theaters joining up this summer"
      for what he describes as "close-up concerts," where artists
      are filmed close up in the studio to give the audience the
      feeling of being at a small concert;
     * NHK: Rupert Stow, who coordinated the NAB's HDTV
     programming sessions,
      said NHK is "straining to fill 3 hours or more each day
     with electronically produced high-definition programming,"
     with nature programming popular.  "They tend to go overseas
     for entertainment, and some of the programs they are
     financing in this country are art- or entertainment-based;"
     and
     * Club Theater Network: Ratner predicted studios will use
     his telecine for "action movies or production-value movies,
     lots of blow-ups and lots of chase scenes."  The company
     also is doing special effects using a Symbolics machine and
     opticals with an HDTV Ultimatte.  In discussion are a
     long-haul demonstration with fiber optics network firm Vyvx
     and a project with cable.

*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese market

*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese market
years ahead of plans by other nations.  Most large Japanese
electronics makers have introduced new consumer HDTV products,
including televisions, videocassette recorders and adapters that
allow HDTV broadcasts to be seen on present TV sets.  But with
the new sets priced at 10 times or more than that of current
top-of-the-line models, consumers may not be rushing to the
stores.  The new equipment, displayed at an international
broadcast equipment show near Tokyo, demonstrates how far ahead
Japanese companies are in commercializing the technology.  Prices
for the new equipment on display at the show ranged from a
Mercedes Benz to a Ford.  Sony's new 36-inch HDTV set, one of the
less-expensive models announced, lists for about $17,700.  A
company spokesman insisted the sets will be bought by "ordinary"
Japanese, to whom Sony plans to sell an initial 100 sets per
month.  "Our current 32-inch model is priced at about $30,700.
In 5 years, we hope to bring that down to about $7,700," said
Hideji Matsuda of Toshiba's new media division.

government and academia.  According to the survey, 70% of the
IEEE respondents said there is more than a 50% chance that
worldwide, compatible HDTV will be implemented by the year 2010.

ATTC SWEEPSTAKES:  WINNERS AND LOSERS,OR WILL THERE
BE PRIZES FOR EVERYONE?

     When the FCC makes the final decision on anHDTV terrestrial
transmission standard, sometime early in 1993, the commission
probably will be picking winners and losers, industry analysts
told HDTV REPORT.  One company or group of companies is likely to
celebrate while others mourn the lost millions they invested.
     The FCC is likely "to pick one of the systems that we know
about now and not likely to force some combination, like the
Zenith RF system and GI's encoding system," predicted James
McKinney, of the Advanced Television Systems Committee.  "Out of
the tests will come one victor."
     There are 2 major parts to the technologies--bandwidth
compression and the transmission system.  Asking contenders to
combine features of their systems could be both a technological
and copyright nightmare, and could produce the proverbial
camel--a horse designed by committee.
     The perception that the government probably will go for one
system has proponents jockeying to combine or redefine proposals.
"There have already been a few accommodations," said CBS' Joseph
Flaherty.  "Whether they combine or not will be a commercial
decision.  I don't think the government will force
[combinations]."  He added, "The digital systems are similar, but
there are enough differences that one could have an advantage
over the others."
     "There will be some losers," said Merrill Weiss of NBC, "but
a single winner is very difficult to predict."

Zenith-General Instrument Still Viewed as Potential Combination

     One combination generating frequent speculation is General
Instrument and Zenith.  "I think it would be a wonderful
combination," said McKinney, "but GI is more interested than
Zenith."  He added, "GI needed help, but they have gotten that
now in their combination with MIT.  That gave them a dramatic leg
up in the RF area.  Their weakness was in the transmission
system, the RF system, and that has now [probably] been covered
by MIT."
     Still, a Zenith-GI coupling is attractive.  "It would make
an obvious all-American winner," McKinney said.  Another factor
is that Zenith is a manufacturer of receiving equipment, while GI
and MIT are not.  Although the winner will have to license the
technology, "if an equipment manufacturer wins, they get to build
for free, so that's probably why GI is interested," he said.
     There is still time right up to testing date for proponents
to get together on their own, "but once they enter the [Advanced
Television Test Center] lab and put the equipment on the test bed
and run tests, then it's very difficult," warned McKinney.  "This
is big risk time.  I don't think everybody is going to win," he
said.  "They're all big boys and they know what they're doing."
