<P>Dear Reader,</P>

<P>It is my honour to be the Chairman of CONCAWE at a time of great challenge.
Environment, health and safety issues continue to rise on the agendas of
governments, non-government and industrial organizations alike. Furthermore,
the manufacture, distribution and consumption of petroleum products is
receiving ever-increasing attention, not least from the public at large.
</P>

<P>Air quality in particular is under the regulatory spotlight, not only
because of the European Auto/Oil Programme, the first phase of which reached
a conclusion in June, but also as a result of other legislative procedures,
e.g. the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), the Air Quality
Framework Directive (AQFD) and the possibility of further directives relating
to fuels and vehicle emissions.</P>

<P>The need for the oil industry to understand and address such issues
effectively means a growth in demand for CONCAWE’s expertise. This need,
however, comes at a time when the industry continues to face problems of
profitability and consequential staff and budget cutbacks. The problem
is compounded by the trend towards increasing specialization. </P>

<P>The reason that CONCAWE was founded (more than 33 years ago), i.e. to
pool limited resources to study environment, health, and safety issues
of mutual interest, makes even more sense now. The efficient use of these
resources will be one of my main priorities as Chairman.</P>

<P>I will ensure that the Management Groups and the CONCAWE Secretariat
continue to work closely together. Collectively, we will maintain an ongoing
dialogue within the industry to ensure that we have a good understanding
of upcoming issues and priorities. In this way, we will be able to undertake
appropriate technical programmes to form the basis of sound decision-making
in a timely manner.</P>

<P>It is also my intention to ensure that CONCAWE maintains its reputation
for technical excellence, even-handedness and openness. We will continue
to provide advice, guidance and data for the European legislative decision-making
process, based on sound-science and costeffectiveness principles, in a
way which will continue to provide excellent value for money. </P>

<P>We will be working hard to improve communications and networking between
CONCAWE’s member companies, particularly through better use of electronic
media. Recognizing also the ongoing need to demonstrate the value of CONCAWE’s
activities, and to publicise the results of our work, we will be assessing
the use of other options, such as newsletters, information meetings, and
issues briefings, in addition to the traditional medium of the CONCAWE
Review. We will also be following with interest the response to our Internet
Home Page which was opened recently. </P>
