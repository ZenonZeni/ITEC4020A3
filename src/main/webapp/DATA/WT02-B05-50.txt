SENATOR LEAHY ASKS CDT LED COALITION TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES TO S. 314 

<p> Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a strong proponent of civil liberties
and the development of new communications technologies,has raised serious
concerns about the Communications Decency Act (S. 314). In a letter to CDT
Executive Director Jerry Berman and th e Interactive Working Group,
Senator Leahy stated that "The proposed legislative solutions . . . raise
serious concerns about the free flow of information in new communications
media, threaten to squelch the development of the Internet and a vital new
ind ustry along with it." 

<p> Senator Leahy has asked the Interactive Working Group (a coalition of
public interest organizations, members of the computer and communications
industry, and associations representing librarians and the press, chaired
by the Center For Democracy and Techn ology) to "explore alternatives that
balance constitutional liberties, competitiveness, and the legitimate
interest of protecting children from accessing controversial content." The
letter is attached below. 

<p> Leahy's efforts to explore alternatives to S. 314 come at an important
time in this debate over S. 314. The Senate Commerce Committee may still
incorporate S. 314 into telecommunications reform legislation, expected to
be introduced as early next Monday ( 3/20). 

<p> It is critical that you contact Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler
(R- SD), Senator Packwood (R-OR), Senator Hollings (D-SC), and your own
Senators and urge them to: <ul><p>

<li>	Take S. 314 off the fast track,
<p>
<li>	Keep S. 314 out of the Senate telecommunications reform legislation, and,
<p>
<li>	Support Senator Leahy's effort to explore alternatives that are
		consistent with the First Amendment and the free flow of information.<p></ul> 

<p> For more information on how to contact members of
congress, send email to the Voter's Telecommunications Watch <a href =
"mailto:vtw@vtw.org">vtw@vtw.org</a>.<p>

<p> While you are at it, you might send a note of thanks to Senator Leahy
for his efforts on behalf of free speech and the free flow of information
in cyberspace. He can be reached by email at <a href =
"mailto:senator_leahy@leahy.senate.gov">senator_leahy@leahy.senate.gov</a>

<p> The Center for Democracy and members of the Interactive Working Group
are grateful to Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue and his
willingness to explore the implications of government efforts to impose
content regulations on interactive media.

SENATOR LEAHY'S LETTER TO INTERACTIVE WORKING GROUP  
<p>
March 15, 1995
<p>
Mr. Jerry Berman<br>
Interactive Working Group<br>
Center for Democracy and Technology<br>
1001 G St., NW<br>
Suite 700 East<br>
Washington, DC 2000<br>
<p>
Dear Mr. Berman:<p>

<p> Interactive communications media are growing at an astonishing rate,
promising great advances for domestic commerce, international
competitiveness, and political and cultural life. Nearly ten years ago, we
began work on the Electronic Communications Priva cy Act ("ECPA"), in
recognition of the fact that new computer and communications technologies
would only flourish in an environment where the privacy rights of users,
the intellectual property rights of content providers, and the obligations
of service pr oviders are clear under statute. We continued that work last
year in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA").
Today, as interactive communications systems expand in the consumer
market, there is a critical need to clarify the First Amendment rights and
responsibilities of information providers, users and carriers. 

<p> As you know, a number of bills have been introduced in the Senate that
would regulate a wide range of controversial content on interactive
information services, including the Internet. This legislation is
motivated by two important goals. First, parents s hould be able to
control their children's access to controversial material. Second, adult
users should be able to exercise reasonable control over the information
they receive so they may avoid material offense to them. The proposed
legislative solutions to achieve these goals raise serious concerns about
the free flow of information in new communications media, and threaten to
squelch the development of the Internet and a vital new industry along
with it. 

<p> I understand that industry and public interest organizations have
independently come together to form the Interactive Working Group in order
to address these issues. My hope is that the group will explore public
policy and technology options for addressin g the problems of children's
access to obscene content in a manner which promotes parental empowerment
and First Amendment values. I would appreciate the Interactive Working
group Consideration of and recommendation on the following issues: 

<p> 1. THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE: <p> What
effect will content regulation have on the development of the national and
global information infrastructure, including the Internet and other
interactive services?  

<p> 2. CURRENT LAW AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: <p>

What is the current lawregulating obscenity and harassment online? What
gaps, if any, are there in current federal and state laws which hamper
prosecution of criminal activity, including violations of the copyright
and obscenity laws, in interactive media ?  

<p> 3. TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS: 

<p> Does interactive technology enable parents to control their children's
access to information in online services today? If not, what steps would
be required to enable such parental control? Can the Working Group provide
demonstrations of these user control technologies?  

<p> 4. CONSTITUTIONAL FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY ISSUES: 

<p> What are the First Amendment implications of content regulation in
interactive media? What is the impact of carrier liability for content on
ECPA , CALEA and constitutional privacy protections? 

<p> Since the passage of the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, and again in CALEA, we have always worked to
assure a proper balance of constitutional liberties, competitiveness and
legitimate government interest in the regulation of new communications te
chnologies. As I receive input from a number of sources on these important
issues, I look forward to your advice as well. My staff is available to
meet with members of your group to discuss these issues further.  

<p>
Sincerely, 

<p> [sig] <p> Patrick J. Leahy United States Senator
