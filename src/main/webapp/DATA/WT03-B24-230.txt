<h1><center> Biotech in Germany Against all odds, a sector emerges</h1> </center> <p>

<B><center>By Karen Bernstein
Editor-in-Chief</B></center><br>
Five years ago -- maybe even two years ago -- most people would have declared the German biotechnology sector dead, never given a chance by the combined memories of eugenics and Green Party fears of genetic engineering. <P>
Times have changed. The growing number of successful biotech drugs has pointed up the life-saving potential of the technology, while the worst fears of genetically altered escapees into the environment have proven to be unfounded. <P>

At the same time, the structural decline of older German industry has, much as elsewhere in the industrialized world, pointed up the necessity of supporting dynamic, young economic sectors. <P>

<b><center>Economic conditions</b></center><P>

As a result, a small, but dynamic and growing biotech sector is beginning to emerge, supported by a variety of government agencies. This group of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, academics and government supporters is well aware of the distance it must travel to catch up with its U.S. counterparts. But it has also identified the critical issues it faces and is taking steps to either remedy or work around the impediments in the German economy that have made it difficult to grow a high-risk sector. <P>

With some 1,200 biotechnology companies, Americans tend to take the sector for granted. But novel industries don't grow on trees. The German experience is a potent reminder that possessing an industrial potential is no guarantee that it can or will develop. Sophisticated science isn't enough without the right economic conditions. <P>

<b><center>The nascent German industry has two difficult hurdles to overcome. </b></center><P>

First and foremost are the regulations and structures that determine the capital and stock markets. The effect of these is to make risk capital scarce in a wealthy country. As a result, while the rest of the world views Germany as an economic powerhouse (despite increasing unemployment and problems with integrating the eastern portion of the country into the west), the Germans we talked to during a recent visit see their nation living off the proceeds from older, maturing industries. Their vision is of a country in danger of being left behind by the new technologies. <P>

Underlying the unavailability of capital is a strong cultural aversion to risk. Entrepreneurs are given few incentives to start ventures, and expect to be stigmatized for failure. Unlike the U.S., where CEOs of failed companies simply move on to the next startup, in Germany one shot is all you get. <P>

<b><center>Lack of incentives</b></center><P>

At the same time, both university scientists and pharmaceutical company middle management -- who in the U.S. would head startups -- have been inclined to stay in safe positions with stable employment rather than to head out into the entrepreneurial unknown. In part, that's because the rules on stock options make them useless as a vehicle to reward success. <P>

Thus while unemployment -- a growing problem in the scientific community -- may shift perceptions toward risk-taking, for the moment all the financial incentives favor people staying at their corporate jobs or university posts. <P>

 "For Germany, the question is how to remain competitive," said Rolf Schneider-Gunther, a general partner at Atlas Venture GmbH, one of only two German venture funds active in the sector. "I just came back from Asia and they don't even talk about Europe anymore. We're off the radar screen." <P>

He estimates that there are 72 biotech companies in Germany, of which the majority are service providers. "These are nice businesses, but not good investments," Schneider-Gunther said, noting that one investor he knows sees only three biotech companies of interest in Germany. <P>

Helmut Schuhsler of TVM Techno Venture Management, the other venture firm active in life sciences, estimates that there are 30 to 600 biotech companies in the country, depending on how the sector is defined. Many are small supply businesses with revenues. <P>

"It's hard to do therapeutics in Germany because there's no venture capital for it," Schuhsler said. "If Atlas and TVM don't like it, there's no money"<P>


<b><center>Capital</b></center></P>

The key to the German biotech dilemma lies in the country's capital structure. "Venture capital is not even a niche in Germany," said Schneider-Gunther. "The reason is you don't have a base of institutional investors providing funds to venture capitalists. Because we have a different social security system, you don't have pension funds as you do in the Anglo-Saxon world. And some types of insurance companies can't invest in venture capital -- instead they invest in large companies and real estate. So the amount of capital available for venture capital is low." <P>

The same problem shows up in the market -- or lack thereof -- for public equities. "Because there are no pension funds, you don't have huge amounts of capital searching for investments -- even if it's only 1 percent of a fund's capital going into high risk stocks," said Metin Colpan, president and CEO of Qiagen GmbH (Hilden), a nucleic acid purification company. <P>

The flip side of the coin is that there's no exit strategy for investors. There are only about 500 public companies in Germany, according to Ronald Mertz, deputy director of the Bavarian State Ministry of Economics, Transportation and Technology. The hurdles for qualifying for a listing on the German stock exchange are high, including a minimum annual turnover of DM100 million (about $70 million) and three years of profitability. <P>

Nor are there investment bankers in the U.S. sense, or sell side analysts to cover stocks. There certainly are no banking boutiques that specialize in biotech, as there are in the U.S. <P>

That puts German biotech startups in a bind. Venture investors want more than potential earnings per share or stock dividends -- they need a way of realizing some multiple on their investment in some finite period. The only way to get that is through the stock market or an acquisition strategy. Now only the U.S. and London exchanges are available for listing, while the potential for the planned EASDAQ (European Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system) only can be proven once the European equivalent of NASDAQ is launched. <P>

Colpan sees the U.S. market as the most logical of the three possibilities for German companies looking to go public. NASDAQ would entail meeting legal hurdles including accounting standards and having a U.S.-based corporate entity. "I don't know how American investors would view a German company going public in the U.S. if it has all of its assets and activities in Germany," he said. <P>

Schneider-Gunther sees the London exchange as the better vehicle. While "great hopes" are riding on EASDAQ, he predicted that it will take time to establish the new exchange as the vehicle of choice for technology companies. Ultimately, he expects that the large German insurance companies -- which already invest in tech stocks -- will buy stocks quoted on EASDAQ. "They will become active players once they're confident it's a liquid market," he said. The new exchange is in the process of raising $15 million to get started. <P>

<b><center>First on EASDAQ</b></center><P>

Ironically, U.S. companies may be the first to benefit from the new exchange. Schuhsler expects that, at least initially, the investment banks and analysts for EASDAQ will be American, rather than French or German banks. And the first companies they will take public on the new exchange will be companies that have already gone public on NASDAQ. "They won't take indigenous European companies first because that will be too risky, so the first EASDAQ companies will be U.S. companies, while European companies will go public on NASDAQ first," he said. <P>


<b><center>Taxation and stock options</b></center><P>

While Germany doesn't have a capital gains tax, it remains hard to attract German managers to biotech because there's no way to reward them. In the U.S., the formula has been simple: the upside lies in the stock options. That isn't possible in Germany, where options are only attractive at the time a company is founded. Founders' stock is taxed at only half of the marginal tax rate up to a certain valuation. <P>

The situation is different for employees, and there are no special provisions for employee incentives. Schuhsler gave as an example a hypothetical startup company that has been given a speculative value of DM10 a share by the VCs. If employees then were given options at DM1, they would immediately be taxed as if they had received regular income of DM9 -- the difference between the valuation and the option price -- even though they haven't exercised the options and have received no money from them. <P>

"If I can't give people stock options, why should they join a small company with the attendant risk?" Schuhsler asked. <P>

In addition, employee options are taxed at a high marginal rate. Thus, Schneider-Gunther said, if an employee received options at DM50 and exercised them at DM100, about DM28 out of the DM50 gain would disappear in taxes. <P>

The way out of this dilemma has been to issue options at the value of the previous funding round. But that isn't as good a deal as employees usually get: most options are issued at 10-25 percent of the prior round, Schuhsler said. <P>


<b><center>Risk-averse culture</b></center><P>

Qiagen's Colpan believes that the major problem facing German companies isn't lack of capital, but the risk-averse culture. "Germans don't grow up to be entrepreneurs," he said. "They grow up to be in a secure environment, thinking about the pension they'll get at 65. So it's hard to recruit the type of management and people necessary to a company." <P>

It's still hard to pull managers out of big pharma to run biotech companies, Schuhsler said. "People in Germany don't yet see the opportunity, they see the risk. They think about their mortgage, their security." <P>

In addition, there are strong penalties for failure. "In Germany, when you start a company and fail you are stigmatized, maybe for life," said Schneider-Gunther. <P>

This is reinforced by an older generation that lost everything it had in not one, but two, world wars, said Carola Schropp of E.B.D. Group, a San Diego, Calif., firm that facilitates business between the U.S. and Europe. <P>

As a result, TVM looks to bring in 30-40 year olds who are running divisions or departments at pharma companies and don't expect to make it to the top. The firm also looks to the U.S. and U.K. for managers. <P>

The problem of identifying the over-achievers likely to be attracted to the challenge of startup companies is exacerbated by the country's egalitarian university system. <P>

"All universities are officially the same," Schropp said. "In the U.S. there's a big difference between the unknown state universities and the top tier universities which are educating 0.1 percent of American students. This is a hidden disadvantage of the German system." <P>

In addition, the very notion of starting a company with the idea of eventually exiting it is foreign to German business culture. "In Germany, if you build up a company, you don't think of selling it," said Schneider-Gunther. "You grow it and pass it on to the next generation. As a result, mid-sized companies are virtually all privately held. They're not interested in venture capital because they don't want to sell off equity. Allowing a financial institution into a company is seen as a weakness, as in, 'He can't do it any more.'"<P>

Still, it is getting easier to recruit management to German biotech, Schuhsler said. The pharmaceutical trend toward downsizing and outsourcing R&D is both making jobs inside pharma less secure and making it easier to see how smaller companies will have a role to play in the sector. <P>

In addition, he said, people are noticing what's been going on in the U.S. "They know that by running a company you can get wealthy and gain a reputation. So in the future it will be more possible to get these people once we've taken one or two companies public and they see there's money to be made." <P>


<b><center>Sources of technology</b></center><P>

In the U.S., much of the drive behind new biotech startups has come from university professors eager to see their discoveries commercialized, and university licensing offices looking to supplement university incomes. <P>

The situation in Germany is potentially more lucrative for academic researchers, because unlike their U.S. counterparts, professors at German universities own the technology they develop -- not the university. There are also fewer restrictions on their ability to start companies based on the technology they've discovered, said Mertz of the Bavarian ministry. <P>

But few took advantage of those rights in the past: it wasn't seen as acceptable to license out technology and make money on it. That attitude is reminiscent of a similar debate that raged in American academia 15 or 20 years ago over the ethics of professors becoming involved with industry. While that debate is well-settled in the U.S., attitudes have changed more slowly in Germany. <P>

Germany also remains behind the U.S. in terms of links between experimental and clinical sciences, according to Gert Riethmuller, who heads the Institute of Immunology at Munich University. Riethmuller was instrumental in the development of Centocor Inc.'s Panorex antibody for colorectal cancer, and has worked with other U.S., U.K. and Danish companies over the years. <P>

"Medical research in Germany is still backward in comparison to other countries," he said. "I couldn't stay in the clinic and do research at the same time, as one could do at Sloan Kettering, or Massachusetts General Hospital, or New York University. The integration of basic research into the clinic is one of the main problems in German medical science. You do see people testing experimental drugs in clinical trials. The problem is earlier, at the research stage." <P>

<b><center>Medical schools</b></center><P>

There is a similar lack of emphasis on research at German medical schools, which are focused on training practitioners, he said. <P>

Nevertheless, this situation also is improving, Riethmuller said, as clinical units are being started within university hospitals. <P>

He has a program in genetics and immune responses, which is running six projects on a DM3.6 million annual budget. Much of the funding is coming from U.S. companies, both biotech and pharmaceutical, for specific projects. <P>

Another critical difference between the U.S. and German systems is the extremely hierarchical nature of German universities, which affords full professors certain privileges they don't get in the U.S., according to Horst Domdey, a scientist at MediGene GmbH in Munich. For example, a full professor with a certain amount of laboratory space can keep all of that space until retirement -- even if it's unutilized. Nor does he or she have to cover the cost of the overhead. <P>

The system allows researchers to pursue long-term projects and obviates the need to write new grant proposals every year. On the other hand, it can mean that lab space is dominated by dead wood and sits idle, giving no outlet for aggressive young researchers. <P>

Parallel to, but outside of the university system, are the numerous institutes of The Max Planck Society. The institutes are mainly devoted to basic research. In particular, they focus on fields that can't be adequately pursued in universities, either because of their interdisciplinary character, or because of requirements for equipment that universities can't afford. The institutes have 11,000 employees, including 3,500 scientists, plus 3,500 fellows and guest scientists from around the world. Its budget of DM1.7 billion is mainly supplied by the federal and state governments. <P>

<b><center>Tech transfer subsidiary</b></center><P>

The institutes are set up as centers of excellence around a key researcher, who is given freedom to hand pick a team. Researchers receive 80 percent of their budget in cash, with the remainder from grants. <P>

Max Planck has set up a subsidiary, Garching Innovation GmbH, to patent and help commercialize discoveries. Unlike the universities, inventions by Max Planck researchers are owned by the institute, not the scientist. However, the institute won't force scientists to file patents. <P>

"When we're aware of something with commercial possibilities, we try to convince the scientist to file a patent," said Garching's Rainer Herbeck. "But the Max Planck Society would never force a scientist to file a patent. If the scientist wants to publish as soon as possible because of competition, he can do that. So the first priority is publication." <P>

There is also a generation gap in the willingness of scientists to file patents, with a general sentiment among the older researchers that they shouldn't earn money off of publicly funded research. "The older directors don't think about patents, or because their work is publicly funded, they don't want to file," said Garching's Jorn Erselius. "The younger directors are more aware of the commercial potential of their work." <P>

For work that is commercialized, 30 percent of the royalties go to the specific institute, 30 percent to the scientist, and the remaining 40 percent to the Society (see story, page A4). <P>

<b><center>German pharma companies</b></center><P>

German pharma companies have been slower than their counterparts elsewhere to jump on the biotech bandwagon. Until recently, they have remained more wedded to traditional medicinal chemistry, Mertz said. In addition, they generally have been interested in later stage technology. When they have considered partnering, Qiagen's Colpan noted, they have tended to look to the U.S. rather than to German companies. <P>

That has started changing, Schneider-Gunther said, as companies such as Hoechst and Bayer are increasingly active in partnering with biotech companies. To date, most deals have been with U.S. companies, and much of the future of German biotech depends on the position these larger companies take vis-a-vis the small German companies, he said. <P>

One positive sign is that German pharma interest in domestic biotech is growing. This is because the pharma side feels it's been over-hyped by some U.S. companies, Schuhsler said. "They're looking at the investments they've made and asking what they got for it. It's a general perception. They also believe there's good German science that hasn't been exploited." <P>


<b><center>Government initiatives</b></center><P>

Perhaps most indicative of the new German attitude toward biotech is a series of government initiatives, at both the federal and state levels, designed to foster a domestic industry (see story, page A5). <P>

Years of the hostile political climate for biotech resulted in moves by pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Hoechst and BASF to locate their biotechnology businesses out of the country. That now is changing, as evidenced by the convergence in policy of two very different German states: Bavaria, which is run by a conservative government, and North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), which has a socialist/Green government. <P>

"The shift occurred with the first products on the market -- people can now see that genetically engineered drugs work," said Mertz. "There is also the job situation: public awareness of our fading competitiveness in many fields is growing." <P>

Schneider-Gunther added that the public's awareness of biotech and its importance has shifted dramatically in the past three or four years, as worry about the German economy has grown. "Germany overall is relying to a large extent on old, established industries, but jobs in these industries are being exported to low wage countries," he said. "The future relies on technology and 'brainware.' The U.S. has 25 percent of the world GDP, but 45 percent of the information technology GDP. The same applies to biotech." <P>

In Bavaria, the initiative to support biotech came from the top, with the prime minister issuing a declaration earlier this decade that the government would promote biotech. In NRW, the impetus was from the bottom. A local initiative in Cologne in 1991 included the chemical trade unions, the chamber of commerce, scientists from Max Planck and companies such as Bayer. The local initiative formally became a state initiative in 1994. <P>

<b><center>Crystal ball</b></center><P>

Cologne's interest in biotech was driven by a reading of the city's future economic prospects. "People feared there was a structural change occurring," said Patricia Solaro, managing director of BioGenTec NRW, the state's biotech initiative. "Steel, coal, chemistry and the car industry are all declining, and we need to find new industrial sectors. Cologne is the fifth largest chemistry location in Europe. We said we have to support biotech because it will be the next key technology for our area." <P>

The Green Party in NRW is learning to differentiate between those aspects of biotech it finds acceptable and those it is against, Solaro said. However, she noted that the situation in some other states isn't as positive. In Hessen, for example, the socialist/Green coalition remains strongly anti-biotech. <P>

Solaro estimated that DM80 million ($56 million) in venture capital was invested in German biotech in 1995, compared to DM49 million in 1994 and about DM20 million in 1993. That makes the DM40 million available from Bavaria and NRW a significant addition to the capital base for biotech. For comparison, $380 million in venture capital was invested in the U.S. last year. <P>


<b><center>Looking forward</b></center><P>

German biotech today enjoys a core of dedicated entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and government officials working hard to build a small, but sustainable sector. The amount of capital is expanding; there is a growing realization that biotech is an overall positive for the nation's economy; the domestic pharmaceutical companies are gaining interest; and there is evidence of shifts in the culture favoring more entrepreneurialism and risk-taking. <P>

Assuming that its technology base has commercial value, Germany ultimately will need to change its stock market and securities regulations to free up domestic capital -- the alternative is to import capital and/or export technology. <P>

There is also a need to change rules regarding stock option incentives in order to attract entrepreneurial talent. And whether capital is domestic or imported, there must be an exit strategy for investors. <P>

With the possible exception of the stock option rules, these changes are not simple. The lack of investment capital and of an exit vehicle for investors are deeply rooted in the entire postwar structure of the German economy, encompassing everything from the way in which society provides social security to the private saving behavior of individual citizens. The kinds of pension funds and mutual funds that fuel the U.S. stock market can't be created by fiat. <P>

These kinds of structural impediments to growth are timely reminders to the U.S. industry that for all of its complaints -- about capital gains taxes, patent issues, price controls in CRADAS, FDA foot-dragging on drug approvals -- the industry's battles occur within an economic framework whose scaffolding is fundamentally supportive of high-risk investment. <P>

In fact, given the ability of capital and technology to move internationally, any shortcomings in one country's economic or financial structure provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs from elsewhere to take advantage of the situation. As Mertz observed, one effect of the lack of opportunity in Germany is that know-how remains relatively cheap. <P>

One potential solution for German biotech is to set up U.S. subsidiaries -- or conversely, to set up American companies with German subsidiaries. <P>

One company planned from the start as a U.S. company is Sequenom Inc. Founded in 1994, the genomics company is based in Boston. "At the time, we didn't believe you could do genetic engineering in Germany," said President and CEO Nola Masterson. "The climate hadn't been supportive financially or scientifically. In addition, the company combines German technology from the University of Hamburg and U.S. technology from Johns Hopkins and Boston University." <P>

At the same time, Sequenom has been able to take advantage of government grants and loans in Germany via its Hamburg subsidiary. "German investors -- including government agencies and TVM -- have liked the fact that we're a U.S. 'Inc.', because we planned to be global from day one," said Masterson. <P>

This example points out that the German industry will need both short- and long-term strategies to survive and mature as the structural impediments are broken down. For example, exporting technology to sources of capital may be a risky but necessary avenue until a more viable German investment climate can be constructed. <P>

Under these circumstances, it is perhaps ironic that the future of the German industry in the long-term may depend less on money and more on the short-term ability of its leaders to develop the kinds of creative approaches to business that are the hallmarks of the U.S. experience. <P>

This kind of talent -- in creating and negotiating novel deals, and inventing capital structures to work around road blocks -- is based primarily on intellectual capacity and experience. The Germans have the former, and they can import the latter for a relatively low price. It is the one aspect of entrepreneurism where the barriers to entry can be reduced, and a small sector, like Germany's, can hope to create a more level playing field. <P>
