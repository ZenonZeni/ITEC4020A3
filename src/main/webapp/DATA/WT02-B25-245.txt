<P>

Two members of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New Mexico provide consultation for the American Indian Family Advocate Project, part of New Mexico's Service System Improvement Grant, which is funded through Community Support Programs of the Center for Mental Health Services. 

<P>

In its second year of a three-year funding cycle, the project relies on the New Mexico AMI consultants to develop advocate training; provide consultation on grass roots support, education and advocacy activities; coordinate revision of family-education materials; develop other culturally appropriate materials; make regular site visits to the advocates; and consult with Indian Health Service personnel. 

<P>

For more information about the project, call the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New Mexico, 1-800-953-6745.

<P>

A Grass Seed Grant--a one-time grant designed to support grassroots development and advocacy by NAMI volunteers in areas such as employment, outreach to special populations, and membership development--resulted in a job-search-skills workbook and program for the Oklahoma AMI that may be reproduced for use by other NAMI affiliates. 

<P>

The Job Search Skills Workbook and a companion leader's guidebook offer tips, explanations, strategies, examples, and hope to those attempting to overcome the stigma attached to mental illness as they prepare to enter or reenter the workforce. 

<P>

Written by William D. Young, Ed.D., of Career Development Services, Inc., and executive director of the Oklahoma AMI, the workbook and guide are intended for use with groups with relatively equivalent occupational objectives, whether they are looking for minimum-wage jobs or top corporate positions. 

<P>

For copies of the workbook and leader's guide--which are looseleaf-bound, suitable for reproduction, and available for $25 (includes shipping and handling)--write to Oklahoma AMI, c/o Bill Young, Executive Director, 1140 N. Hudson Ave., Oklahoma City, OK 73103, or call 405/239-6264.

<P>

More than 12.5 million families in our neighborhoods and communities are affected by severe mental illnesses, and 175,000 individuals have picked up the phone to call the NAMI Helpline since it began in October of 1990. 

<P>

Records show that--of those that were identified--about 33 percent of the calls are from consumers, 17 percent from siblings or adult children; 15 percent from parents of an adult with mental illness, 11 percent from professionals, eight percent from other relatives, seven percent from parents with a child with mental illness, six percent from a spouse, and three percent are from students or teachers.   

<P>

About 50 trained volunteers staff the operation to answer these 40 thousand to 50 thousand calls a year and mail printed responses.  Those who take the calls listen carefully to people who need to know they are not alone and that help is available.  Callers are mailed information about mental illnesses and are given the phone numbers of their local and state NAMI affiliates.  The information most often requested is about depressive disorders and schizophrenia.

<P>

Diana Ross and Larry King have both referred audiences to the NAMI Helpline, and so have such magazines as Parade, U.S. News and World Report, Time, Reader's Digest, Ladies Home Journal, Essence, Family Circle, Self, YM, and Sassy.  Television programs--especially movies such as Out of Darkness or Call Me Anna--result in the greatest number of calls, but many are also prompted by newspapers, magazines, NAMI publications, and books.

<P>

<A NAME = "irisp"><H2>IRIS Project Raises Awareness</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

The AMI Iris Project--AMI of Wisconsin's grassroots public education and fund-raising effort--continues to grow throughout the country, and it serves as a model for similar projects members may want to launch.

<P>

The Iris Project involves the distribution of lapel-sized, silk irises with a tag explaining that the iris is a symbol of hope for AMI affiliates.  The irises may be sold, exchanged for donations, or given away as a public-education tool.

<P>

Since the project began a year and a half ago, more than 80 AMI affiliates have participated and ordered 70,000 flowers.  AMI of Wisconsin hopes to someday see the iris on as many lapels as the veterans' poppy or the AIDS ribbon.  Affiliates of any size and budget can make an impact in their community and raise money simultaneously. 

<P>

Most affiliates find the average donation for an iris is $1--a 350 percent profit.  Three Wisconsin affiliates netted between $800 and $1,400 during the 1993 Mental Illness Awareness Week with permission from stores for volunteers to stand at entrances with baskets of irises.  The top money-maker--AMI of Waukesha, an affiliate of 80 members in a town of 58,000--earned that $1,400 in one day by targeting two WalMart stores.  Customers donated more than $1,000 for 900 irises, and the store contributed $400.

<P>

Why not ask a garden club or retailer to help promote the project?  Many donors ask questions about the AMI or take brochures or talk of their own experiences.  Use irises at conferences, awards dinners, legislative days and rallies or during May, Mental Health Month.  AMI of Wisconsin has the silk irises, collection canisters, and a marketing guide. 

<P>

Irises must be ordered in multiples of 100, and they cost $.30 each for 100 to 900 and $.28 each for 1,000 or more.  For information, call AMI of Wisconsin, 1410 Northport Drive, Madison, WI 53704.  608/257-5888.
