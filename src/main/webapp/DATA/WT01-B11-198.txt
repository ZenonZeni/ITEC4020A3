<B>Non-Renewable Resources<BR>
FACT SHEET
</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is changing the way it regulates Ontario's aggregate, petroleum and brine industries.<P>

Through business planning, MNR has restructured its non-renewable resource programs (aggregates, petroleum and brine) to shift more responsibility for direct program delivery to industry.  MNR will concentrate its core focus on policy development, the setting and enforcement of standards, and approvals of permits and licences.<P>

This new business approach will also involve a shift from complex, detailed legislation and regulations to ones that are simpler and more streamlined, backed by detailed technical standards.  This is similar to the approach taken with the forest industry under the Crown Forests Sustainability Act.<P>

The restructuring of the ministry's non-renewable resources program is consistent with the government's plan to provide better government services at a reasonable price to taxpayers.  It will help to reduce the cost of government, eliminate red tape, and remove barriers to private sector job creation.<P>

The aggregates and petroleum industries will become more accountable for meeting provincial standards.  Through compliance partnerships, responsibility for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring will be transferred to industry. <P> 

MNR will be responsible for auditing industry operations to ensure compliance with legislation and standards, and for enforcing the law in situations of non-compliance.  The revised Acts enhance enforcement through increased fines, longer licence suspensions and a longer time period to initiate prosecution.  Companies, agencies and individuals will remain liable for their actions.<P>
<BR>
<B>Changes to Aggregates Industry Regulation</B>
<UL>
<LI>Detailed guidelines will be provided in technical standards, which will be developed in consultation with industry and other key stakeholders.  They will be published and available to all stakeholders and will provide greater clarity than the current regulations.<P>


<LI>Industry will be responsible for day-to-day site inspections and monitoring to ensure compliance with legislation, regulations and standards.  Industry will be required to submit compliance reports to the ministry and will be held legally accountable for the accuracy of those reports.  MNR will verify the accuracy of reports through random auditing.  Two pilot projects in 1995 proved very successful in ensuring compliance. <P> 


<LI>Public authority and personal aggregate permits will be eliminated to help facilitate streamlining of the program. Currently public authority and personal permits have a restriction which prohibits the resale of extracted material. Permit holders will now be able to obtain a new aggregate permit if they can meet applicable standards.  If they are unable to meet the standards, they will have to get their aggregate from another licensed operation.<P>

<LI>In keeping with the trust fund model developed in the Crown Forest Sustainability Act, a trustee will assume responsibility for the functions associated with the aggregates trust fund. The trust has been established to collect and disburse annual licence fees; administer the Abandoned Pits and Quarries Rehabilitation Fund; and, administer a new pooled trust fund to provide for rehabilitation where aggregate permits and licences have been revoked as a result of default (e.g. bankruptcy).<P>

<LI>The Aggregate Producers Association of Ontario will be responsible for the administration and delivery of the rehabilitation program associated with the Abandoned Pits and Quarries Rehabilitation Fund.
</UL><P><BR>
<B>Changes to Regulation of the Petroleum and Brine Industries</B>
<UL>
<LI>Similar to the aggregates industry, legislation and regulations governing the petroleum and brine (salt solution mining) industries will be streamlined and simplified.  Operational standards will be developed to provide detailed, technical guidelines for the industry.  These standards will be similar to the current Canadian Standards Association standard for hydrocarbon storage.<P>

<LI>MNR will continue to conduct field inspections with strengthened powers. For example, inspectors will have the authority to order the plugging of wells.<P>

Private inspectors, certified by the ministry, will also be used. This combination will provide a solid framework to guarantee operations are complying with Ontario's environmental standards.<P>


<LI>The revised Petroleum Resources Act enhances enforcement, including increasing fines (to a maximum of $500,000 from $10,000) and extending the time period for initiating prosecution.<P>

<LI>The current well permit system, which only addresses the regulatory functions associated with drilling, will be changed to a life-cycle well licence.  This will require adherence to operational standards for the life of the well, from the initiation of well drilling to the final plugging and abandonment.  The activities covered include drilling, production, maintenance, and change in well status or purpose.  A life-cycle well licence will eliminate the need for annual production and rig licences and special brine well permits under the Mining Act.<P>

<LI>A new trust account funded by industry will pay for the operation of the geological core and chip library managed by MNR, ensuring the continuation of this information and research service to the industry and academic institutions. <P>
