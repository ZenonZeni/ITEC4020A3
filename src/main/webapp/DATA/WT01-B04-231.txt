<p><em>by Mark Clements</em>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/sludgemn.jpg" ALT="Preparing Sludge for Treatment"  ALIGN=right>
<p>	A Time for Celebration -- On October 18, the DuraMelter 5000, the world's largest low-level
radioactive waste melter, began converting sludge into glass at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
Savannah River Site (SRS).  This is the first <em>commercial</em> cleanup effort to use vitrification on a DOE site.

<p>	"This project is the largest commercial use of vitrification to date.  GTS Duratek has created good
paying jobs in the South Carolina area and is solving a very important environmental problem.  In addition,
the M-Area cleanup is a key commitment made to the state by the DOE, and GTS Duratek is on track to
help us meet our milestone," said Mario Fiori, DOE's SRS Operations Manager.

<p>	GTS Duratek built, owns, and operates the plant, called the Vendor Treatment Facility, or VTF.  Over
the next 6 to 12 months, the Company's VTF operations staff will convert approximately 660,000 gallons
of waste into glass.  This waste represents only 1% of the radioactive waste at SRS.  Upon completion of
this contract, the VTF will be available to process additional waste streams.

<p>	At a grand opening hosted by Westinghouse Savannah River Company on October 28, DOE and S.C.
state officials, as well as members of the local media, were on hand to see the DuraMelter 5000 convert
radioactive waste to glass gems.

<p><A NAME="hanf"></A><H3><B>BNFL/GTSD Team Wins at Hanford</H3></B>

<p><em>by Brad Bowan</em>

<p>	On September 25, 1996, GTS Duratek announced that it -- as a key member of the BNFL-led team --
has been awarded a contract for the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) at the U.S. Department of
Energy's Hanford Site in Washington state.  The Hanford TWRS project is one of the largest and most
difficult radioactive waste cleanup efforts in the United States.  GTS Duratek will provide the technical and
support services for converting both high- and low-level mixed waste into glass (vitrification).  The total
contract is estimated to be worth $4 billion over 11 years.  The initial Phase 1-A is worth $27 million and
will take 16 months to complete.

<p>	Phase 1-A starts with the design of a facility and initiation of the environmental permitting process. 
Based on its satisfaction with this work, the DOE will grant permission to begin Phase 1-B, which includes
facility construction, startup, and processing of 10% of the tank waste.  Both phases are precursors to
Phase 2 -- a project that could last 20 to 30 years -- during which the entire inventory of tank waste will
be converted to glass.  The total TWRS project cost is estimated to reach from $20 billion to $40 billion.

<p>	GTS Duratek's teammates include BNFL Inc, the American subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels plc,
one of the world's largest processors of radioactive waste; Bechtel National, Inc., the leading provider of
project and construction management in the United States; and Science Applications International
Corporation (SAIC), a multi-billion-dollar, employee-owned company with extensive DOE environmental
permitting experience.

<p>	Rolland Langley, president and CEO of BNFL Inc., said, "This is the first major win for the
BNFL/GTS Duratek strategic alliance.  It is a great beginning to what we plan to work on together."

<p>	Robert E. Prince, president and CEO of GTS Duratek, added, "This is the largest vitrification project
in the world and one of the most important projects for the U.S. environment.  Since 1991, the GTS
Duratek management team has focused on getting both our technology and services primed for this
contract.  This award certainly marks an extremely significant milestone in our company's history."

<p><A NAME="darm"></A><H3><B>GTS Duratek Hosts Darman Book Signing</H3></B>

<p><em>by Angela Roe</em>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/darman.jpg" ALT="Mr. Richard Darman signs copies of his book, Who's in Control"  ALIGN=right>
<p>	GTS Duratek's new corporate headquarters building, under construction, was the backdrop for a recent
book signing the Company hosted for Richard Darman, a managing director of The Carlyle Group, GTS
Duratek's controlling shareholder.

<p>	Darman's book, <em>Who's In Control?  Polar Politics and the Sensible Center,</em> discusses how the
American bipartisan system has become polarized -- extreme left and right.  The "once dependable,
pragmatic center"  in American politics seems to have vanished as each side seeks to further its own cause. 
Based on his extensive experience, Darman provides hope in the political system's "capacity for self
correction."  He believes neither side can be in complete control of national policy; the "sensible center"
will return to its rightful place between the left and the right, and compromise can again temper the
extremes of the two camps.

<p>	Richard Darman has served in six U.S. cabinet departments.  He was also Assistant to the President
and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under President Reagan and Director of the Office of Management
and Budget in President Bush's cabinet. 

<p>	Since most of GTS Duratek's home office employees do not have access to Washington insiders, they
didn't know what to expect.  Two minutes into     Mr. Darman's commentary, they were captivated by his
knowledge, style, and honesty.  Mr. Darman's comments about tactics and personalities on Capitol Hill
were entertaining as well as informative.  GTS Duratek president and CEO, Bob Prince, said, "One of the
advantages of being associated with The Carlyle Group is that we have the opportunity to be exposed to
some of the most experienced former government executive leaders.  It is a great benefit for our employees. 
We thank Mr. Darman for sharing his thoughts with us."

<p>	<em>Who's In Control</em> by Richard Darman, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, is available at book stores
everywhere.


<p><A NAME=golf><H3><B>GTS Duratek Participant on Winning Team at Duke Power-Sponsored Golf Tournament</H3></B>

<p><em>by Stan Tollison</em>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/golf.jpg" ALT="The winners: Lou, Matt, Randy"  ALIGN=right>
<p>	It was a hot August 8th, both in temperature and golf scores for the Duke Power ESS/NDE-sponsored
United Way golf tournament, held at Woodbridge Golf Links near Kings Mountain, South Carolina. 
Temperatures of 90+ degrees wore most of the participants down by the end of the day.

<p>	The team of Matt Bibb and Randy Dyer of Duke Power and Lou Kummer of GTS Duratek turned in a
blistering 61 for the win.  Four second-place teams turned in scores of 62, and the rest of the teams were
around 68.

<p>	Twenty teams started, using a scramble format and shotgun start.  The winning team turned in nine
birdies and two eagles.  The winning hole for the team was the par-five, 488-yard number six, which,
coincidentally, was sponsored by GTS Duratek.  On top of that, because of the shotgun start, it was the last
hole they played.  The team realized that they would need an eagle to cinch the win.  Rising to the occasion,
they carefully navigated the hole by hitting a great tee shot, followed by an outstanding second shot, which
put them 12 feet from the cup.  Randy Dyer sunk the winning putt for the eagle.

<p>	 Prizes were awarded for everything from a hole-in-one to longest drive and closest to the pin on one of
the par-threes.  The winning team took home a free round of golf at a local private golf course and many
other prizes.

<p>	Duke Power will sponsor another tournament next year, but has promised that all contractors will have
to play with no handicap, left-handed, blindfolded, and in their bare feet with no sunglasses. 

<p> 	A great time was had by all with proceeds from the tournament going to the local United Way of
Greater Charlotte.

<p><A NAME="cpas"><H3><B>New On-Line Data Base for Computer Services</H3></B>

<p>	After nearly ten years of providing computer professional staff augmentation support for a wide variety
of clients, GTS Duratek's Computer Services group recently evaluated its business processes to identify
areas where improvements could be made. 

<p>	The main focus of this evaluation was the group's resume data base.  It needed a sophisticated but
user-friendly data base that could track candidates, resumes, and clients in a more efficient manner.  After
several months of research, demos, and presentations, the group selected a state-of-the-art, on-line data
base.

<p>	Now, in the process of implementation, Computer Services is already seeing the benefits of the new
tool.  With this fully integrated system, work flow is tracked from job opportunity through candidate
application, submittal, and hire.  Recruiters are able to perform both keyword and full-text searches of
candidate records and resumes, on-line editing, and paperless faxing.  GTS Duratek can submit resumes to
clients via e-mail with one simple click of a mouse.  Information on a candidate's status relating to job
submittal, interviews, and offers is tracked automatically by the system.

<p>	Another benefit of this new data base is that its efficiency results in more time for recruiters to reach
larger numbers of candidates than before.  It also allows account managers to spend more time outside of
the office tracking down new job opportunities.  Very clearly, GTS Duratek's Computer Services group
now has a definite edge over the competition.

<p><A NAME="esh"><H3><B>GTS Duratek Supports DOE ES&H Training Efforts</H3></B>

<p><em>by Jeff Johnston</em>


<p>	The DOE's Office of Technical Training and Professional Development (EH-74) in the Office of
Environment, Safety and Health (EH) has contracted GTS Duratek to provide training to support
implementation of the Department's Technical Qualification Program (TQP).  The DOE created the TQP
to enhance the technical knowledge level of DOE federal employees in a variety of disciplines.  

<p>	Under this contract, GTS Duratek provides the DOE with courses addressing radiation protection
topics in three areas of the TQP:  General Technical Base, Radiation Protection Functional Areas, and
Radiation Protection Topical Areas.

<p>	GTS Duratek's in-house subject matter experts and instructional technologists develop training
modules using the Instructional Systems Design (ISD) approach.  The project consists of three phases:
training material development, pilot program implementation, and training implementation.  Approved
lesson plans, student manuals, visual training aids, and examination question banks cover all established
objectives and meet training requirements outlined in applicable sections of the TQP.  The audience for
these training programs includes DOE headquarters employees from the Offices of Environmental
Management (EM), Defense Programs (DP), and EH.

<p>	As a result of GTS Duratek's support to DOE headquarters, Wackenhut Services, Inc. contracted GTS
Duratek to assist in development and implementation of the Radiological and Nuclear Physics
Fundamentals elements of the TQP via interactive television broadcasts.  

<p>	Wackenhut operates the DOE's Central Training Academy (CTA) at Kirtland Air Force Base in
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  GTS Duratek authored instructor scripts and developed and edited visual aids
(video clips, photographs, still graphics, and animation sequences).  In September, the Company's own
Dean Iversen and Jeff Johnston donned coat, tie, and makeup and presented the live broadcasts via satellite
from the CTA to 18 DOE sites nationwide (with an estimated audience of 500 to 1000 DOE personnel). 
Dean and Jeff secured their place in training history, since sessions were taped for distribution and future
training use throughout the DOE complex. 

<p>	Wackenhut has subsequently requested GTS Duratek to develop and present a similar broadcast for
non-radiological industrial safety and health topics within the TQP.  This broadcast is tentatively scheduled
for January 16 and 17, 1997.

<p><A NAME="therm"><H3><B>DuraTherm Builds Industry Recognition</H3></B>

<p><em>by Joyce Frassanito</em>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/o&g.jpg"   ALIGN=right>
<p>	DuraTherm, GTS Duratek's 80%-owned-subsidiary, recently received recognition for its advanced
thermal desorption technology from the petroleum industry press and government entities.  <em>Oil & Gas
Journal,</em> the leading paid subscription publication of the petroleum industry, featured DuraTherm's
recycling technology as the cover story for its September 16 issue.  <em>Hydrocarbon Reprocessing</em> included
DuraTherm Desorption<sup>TM</sup> in its August environmental issue.  The  U.S.-Asia Environmental Partnership
(US-AEP) chose DuraTherm for the first issue of its <em>Tech Report</em>         newsletter.  That organization is
charged with matching Asian environmental needs with U.S. environmental experience, technology, and
practice.

<p><A NAME="therm2"><H3><B>DuraTherm Receives Recycling Approval</H3></b>

<p><em>by Joyce Frassanito</em>

<p>	The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has approved the recycling of
process residues, from operation of the thermal desorber,  into prefabricated concrete building products. 
Recycling eliminates the need for costly disposal of the process residue as hazardous waste.  Brad Hogan,
vice president of DuraTherm, originated the idea and led the project to obtain the state's acceptance.  The
concrete blocks, or "DuraBlocks," can be used for sea walls and other environmentally important
structures.  Recycling of the process residue into a useful product significantly lowers overall operating
costs.

<p>	Robert Hensel, president of DuraTherm, said, "This will provide our customers with a unique
opportunity to have their listed waste residues incorporated into a recycled product that will not be subject
to Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations.  We have also recently developed the
ability to process more difficult waste streams, broadening the range of waste that we are able to accept
from our customers." 

<p>	Robert E. Prince, president and CEO  of GTS Duratek, added, "DuraTherm can now recycle a process
waste residue into a useful product that has historically cost over $100 a ton for disposal in a hazardous
landfill.  They are making a big step towards being a total recycling facility.  Not only is it good for the
environment to recycle this residue, it is also good business."
