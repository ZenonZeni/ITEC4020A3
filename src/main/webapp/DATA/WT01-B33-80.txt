<h2>It's Time for New Battle Plan in the Losing War on Drugs</h2>

<p>by Judge James P. Gray<br>
<br>
Our great country is reeling from self inflicted wounds resulting
from our<br>
current failed &quot;war on drugs.&quot; It is clear that we are
not in better shape<br>
today than we were five years ago regarding drug use and abuse
and all of<br>
the crime and misery that accompany them. Unless we change our
approach,<br>
we can have no legitimate expectation that we will be in better
shape next<br>
year than we are today.<br>
However, we will not pursue change until we realize, as a
country, that it<br>
is all right to talk about this issue-and that just because we
talk about<br>
the possibility of changing our drug policy does not mean that we
condone<br>
drug use or abuse.<br>
During the election season, let us as voters challenge all
candidates for<br>
all offices to take a fresh and objective look at our most basic
drug<br>
policy assumptions and recommend changes based upon the evidence.
Let us<br>
tell all candidates in the clearest of terms that it is not only
all right,<br>
but it is essential to discuss this critical issue openly fully.<br>
In the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; victory is now literally being
viewed as slowing<br>
down the pace of defeat. Our present policy has made cocaine the
most<br>
lucrative crop in the history of mankind. It has made marijuana
the most<br>
lucrative crop in California, easily outdistancing the
second-leading crop,<br>
which is corn.<br>
Our present policy is directly funneling tens of billions of
dollars per<br>
year into organized crime, with all of its accompanying violence
and<br>
corruption both in our country and around the world. Our present
policy is<br>
directly causing our children in the inner cities and virtually
everywhere<br>
else to have drug dealers as their role models, instead of people
who have<br>
gotten their education and worked hard to be successful.<br>
Our present policy has at the same time both increased street
crime and<br>
diverted scarce resources away from its prosecution. Our present
policy<br>
has directly spawned a cycle of hostility by the incarceration of
vastly<br>
disproportionate numbers of minority groups. And our present
policy is<br>
directly responsible for medical doctors being unable to
prescribe<br>
appropriate medications for their patients who are either in pain
or are<br>
suffering from a number of devastating diseases.<br>
If there is any universal agreement in any area of drug policy,
it is that<br>
the education of our young and our not so young people is
critically<br>
important in combating drug abuse, and that to an appreciable
degree for<br>
non-addicted users, it works. Social pressure is another
effective<br>
deterrent to drug abuse, as is drug treatment, which has been
determined by<br>
the Rand Corp. in a 1994 study to be seven times more effective
than drug<br>
prosecution, even for addicted drug users.<br>
Similarly, education. social pressure and treatment have been
effective in<br>
decreasing the use of other dangerous and sometimes addictive
drugs, such<br>
as alcohol and tobacco-even though these drugs are not illegal
for adults. <br>
It may be that the recently documented increased use of marijuana
by<br>
teenagers, and the frustration and resignation shown by their
parents, has<br>
resulted from less emphasis upon drug education. If so, maybe we
should at<br>
least consider investing our increasingly scarce resources where
they will<br>
be most productive, instead of routinely continuing to spend
enormous and<br>
never-ending tax dollars on the incarceration of nonviolent drug
users.<br>
All responsible citizens understand the necessity of holding
people<br>
accountable for their actions. However, our citizens are becoming<br>
increasingly aware that the criminal justice system is simply not
able to<br>
make meaningful progress in this area because of the obscene
profits to be<br>
made in selling illegal drugs.<br>
As a result, thousands of Americans such as Dr. Milton Friedman,
former<br>
Secretary of State George Shultz, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore
and<br>
former San Jose Chief of Police Joseph McNamara have signed a
resolution<br>
calling for the investigation of change by a neutral commission.<br>
This resolution actually was passed by Congress and signed into
law by<br>
President Clinton as a part of the recent crime bill; however, it
has been<br>
widely ignored since that time. The signatories of the resolution
include<br>
large numbers of judges; civic, business and religious leaders;
probation<br>
officers and prison officials, medical doctors, teachers and
counselors. <br>
There is wide support for the investigation of change-our present
policy<br>
simply will not stand scrutiny.<br>
We are the ones who elect our governmental officers, so the
responsibility<br>
for their silence and inaction is ours to bear. However, this can
be<br>
changed. Let all candidates know that we voters understand that
the honest<br>
exchange of information is the only way we will begin to reduce
the<br>
continuing harm wrought by these dangerous drugs in our country.
Tell them<br>
we demand that the law be followed and the neutral commission be
appointed.<br>
If we the voters demand that these important issues be discussed,
our<br>
leaders will follow.<br>
