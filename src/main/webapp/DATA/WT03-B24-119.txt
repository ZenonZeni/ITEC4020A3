<p>
<h2>I.   Ed Roback, National Institute of Standards and
     Technology</h2>
<p>
     Welcome
<p>
     Mr. Ed Roback, serving as moderator for the meeting,
     opened the meeting with a welcome, announcements
     (including notice the meeting would be taped) and
     introductions of the panel members.
<p>
<p>
<h2>II.  Michael R. Nelson, Co-Chairman IWG/ET</h2>
<p>
     Perspectives, Objective of Criteria, and Future Plans
<p>
     Dr. Michael R. Nelson presented the Administration's
     perspectives, objectives, and future plans. He
     explained the five goals and objectives for the
     December 5 meeting. They were as follows:
<p>
     1. explain the criteria to ensure that they are
        clearly understood;
<p>
     2. discuss the Administration's proposed desirable
        characteristics for key escrow agents and approach
        to developing and implementing an approval
        process;
<p>
     3. understand reactions and desired changes to the
        draft criteria and proposed key escrow agent
        characteristics;
<p>
     4. explain the Administration's plans to revise and
        implement these criteria (with revisions, as
        appropriate);
<p>
     5. identify other areas requiring follow-up
        attention.
<p>
     Several questions from the audience included a request
     for assurance that the current issue is not
     establishing domestic regulation and why the key
     length was being limited to 64-bit keys. Dr. Nelson
     assured the group, the current discussion related to
     EXPORT criteria only. He stated that the key length
     (of the symmetric session key) is currently limited to
     64-bits to see if this concept results in products for
     which the key escrow mechanism cannot be easily
     defeated. If, as time passes, the concept proves
     viable and resistant to attack, changes may be
     appropriate.
<p>
<h2>III. Clint Brooks, National Security Agency</h2>
<p>
     Exportability Criteria Discussion
<p>
     Dr. Clint Brooks reviewed the Draft Software Key
     Escrow Encryption Export Criteria (11/95 version),
     including the six criteria associated with the key
     escrow feature, the two criteria associated with the
     key length feature, and one criterion each associated
     with the interoperability feature and design,
     implementation, and operational assurance. Criterion
     five, which requires a product's key escrow feature to
     allow access to the key(s) needed to decrypt the
     product's ciphertext regardless of whether the product
     sent or received the information, generated the most
     discussion. Dr. Brooks explained the primary need for
     the requirement was for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA)
     to access a subject's communications when authorized.
<p>
     Criterion five generated such discussion that Mr. Ed
     Allen (FBI) supplemented Dr. Brooks presentation by
     detailing the LEA objective(s) for criterion 5. Some
     of the rationale included, LEA's gaining subject['s]
     key is consistent with the current approach of
     electronic surveillance (i.e. tapping lines) and helps
     preserve the ability to react in real time by
     obtaining *only* the subject's key. Mr. Allen
     addressed several questions regarding cooperation and
     status of agreements with other countries and he noted
     the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLANTS) would need
     to be modified.
<p>
<h2>
IV.  Geoff Greiveldinger, U.S. Depsrtment of Justice</h2>
<p>
     Draft Key Escrow Agent Characteristics
<p>
     Mr. Geoff Greiveldinger reviewed the draft Key Escrow
     Agent Characteristics consisting of twenty criteria
     addressing escrow system integrity and security and
     key aceess requirements. The group questions primarily
     centered around criterion seven which requires at
     least one person who possess[es] a SECRET clearance
     for purposes of processing classified requests and
     requirements to maintain auditable records. Several
     participants, including one from Netscape, stated they
     do not endorse the Administration's proposal and that
     they are losing sales and having products returned,
     because of their inability to export products with
     marketable key escrow features. Questions were raised
     regarding what agency would grant approval and
     maintain valid holders. Additional concerns regarding
     escrow agents who later went out of business were
     raised.
<p>
<p>
<h2>V.   Industry Perspectives</h2>
<p>
<h3>     Bill Sweet, Trusted Information Systems Inc.</h3>
<p>
     Is There a Path to Global Information Security?
<p>
     Mr. Sweet's presentation included views that customers
     do not want escrow controlled by lots of other people,
     information owners should control their assets, not
     the government -- the information is someone else's
     property, the current proposal gives control to the
     receiver not where it should be with the sender, and
     American companies do not want some foreign countries
     to have access to keys. One key question was whether
     companies can designate where keys can be escrowed,
     even if the location is not the United States. Dr.
     Nelson responded that in addition to being held with
     an agent approved by the U.S., the current proposal
     does not disallow a company from designating somewhere
     other than the U.S., for example, Holland. Answers to
     questions regarding bilateral agreements with other
     countries were answered when a clear statement was
     made that no bilateral agreement need exist if keys
     are deposited in the U.S. A bilateral agreement is
     only necessary, when keys are exclusively held by
     another country.

</h3>
     A Private Sector Proposal for Trusted Third Party
     (a.k.a. Data Recovery Center) Registration
<p>
     Mr. Mendelson described his proposal for a
     vendor-based registration framework, including a
     "Trusted Third Party Application Form". He believes
     already-established procedures can be used to collect
     the required information.

     Dorothy E. Denning, Georgetown University
</h3>
     Criterion #5: Access Through Sender and Receiver
     Rationale, Technical Approaches, Exposure Risks, and
     Wording
<p>
     Dr. Denning reviewed different approaches to key
     escrow encyption and to satisfying criterion #5,
     showing that the criterion is met by most products and
     proposals for key escrow. She also discussed the
     privacy implications of criterion #5 vs. one that
     would require access *only* through the sender,
     concluding that criterion #5 is *not* more invasive of
     privacy. Finally, her submitted paper discusses a
     concern that the current wording does not obligate the
     sending product to ensure access through the receiving
     product and suggests a rewrite. Her paper can be

<h3>
     Melanie Janin, U. S. Council for International
     Business
</h3>
     Comments on Encryption Policy at The National
     Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
<p>
     Ms. Janin presented a comparison of the U.S. Council's
     "Business Requirement for Encryption," issued over one
     year ago, with the U.S. Government's proposed policy.
     She found that some of the U.S. Council's requirements
     have been satisfied, some not, and some are unclear.
     Ms. Janin emphasized the U.S. Council's desire to meet
     with the Government to clarify some of these
     unresolved issues.
<p>
<h3>
     Ed Scheidt, Tecsec
</h3>
     Mr. Scheidt believed the next steps were to get moving
     and test products and the policy because it is
     essential to provide immediate relief for escrowed
     encryption and we need to rely on the Administration
     to bring U.S. privacy products to the rest of the
     world.
<p>
<h3>
     Shaber Safdar, Voters Telecommunications Watch
</h3>
     Mr. Safdar described an Internet survey of security
     professionals the Voters Telecommunications Watch
     group is conducting. The survey was posted one week
     prior to the December 5 meeting. They have received a
     total of 26 responses. Twenty-four of the twenty-six
     respondents stated they would never purchase software
     or hardware with law enforcemcnt access. Sixteen of
     these twenty-four responded they are already using
     products without law enforcerncnt access. Respondents
     would support industry in quest of market driven
     cryptographic standards.
<p>
<h3>
     Robert W. Holleyman II, Business Software Alliance
</h3>
     Testimony of Robert W. Holleyman II, President,
     Business Software Alliance, on Encryption Export
     Policy and thc U.S. Software Industry: Chipping Away
     at America's International Competitiveness.
<p>
     Mr. Holleyman believes that despite concerns expressed
     by companies and association, and privacy advocates,
     during previous NIST meetings, little has changed in
     the Administration's proposal. He believes the
     proposal is unworkable and unacceptable. He states
     that information security is critical and 40-bit keys
     are pathetic and although the proposal of 64-bit keys
     is an improvement, it is insufficient. He proposes a
     Cost of Cracking Adjustment (COCA), in which an
     automatic increase in the permissible key length by
     two bits every three years. The base length is based
     on immediately permitting the export of generally
     available software progruns employing the Data
     Encryption Standard (DES) algonthm or other algorithms
     at comparable strengths.

     David Sobol, Electronic Privacy Information Center
<h3>
     Comments on Draft Export Criteria for Key Escrow
     Encryption
</h3>
     Mr. Sobol states that users are unlikely to adopt key
     escrow systems on a voluntary basis, and is afraid
     what is voluntary will become standard and result in
     the eventual prohibition of non-escrowed products. He
     questions the role of public comment in the process,
     because it is frequently solicited but never heeded,
     referencing the 1993 proposed Escrowed Encryption
     Standard, or Clipper. Most comments were negative, as
     NIST acknowledged in its Federal Register notice
     adopting the standard. Another major issue, is the
     Cryptographic Competitiveness Study conducted by the
     Bureau of Export Administration has not been released.
     EPIC has initiated litigation under the FOIA seeking
     the release of the study. (Note: It was released on
     1/18/96.)
<p>
<h3>
     Padgett Peterson, Lockheed Martin
</h3>
     Mr. Peterson commented that major corporations must be
     able to become licensed key agents, the issue of
     property rights is important, and policies must
     guarantee confidentiality to customers.
<p>
<h3>
     Alex McIntosh, PC Security Limited (UK)
</h3>
     Mr. McIntosh described a system his company designed
     for Shell. He believes control should be delivered to
     the desktop and states the issue of liability has been
     ignored and we must understand who will be liable.
<p>
<h3>
     Doug Miller, Software Publishers Association
</h3>
     Comments of thc Software Publishers Association on
     11/95 Draft Export Criteria for Key Escrow Encryption
<p>
     Mr. Miller states member companies are poised to meet
     the needs of a secure, private, and trusted Global
     Information Infiastructure (GII), but cannot because
     of the barriers the U.S. cryptography policy continues
     to impose. Although the 11/95 draft criteria reflect
     a few of the suggested changes, the changes made are
     minor compared with the fundamental problems of the
     proposal. Members have analyzed the global marketplace
     for encryption and concluded key escrow systems will
     simply not be marketable in a world in which non-
     escrow encryption is widely available at greater than
     40 bits. He further states that the Department of
     Commerce study will say there are not strong products
     out there but members of SPA say they are loosing
     business and bilateral agreanents will take a long
     time; U.S. companies need immediate relief.

<h3>
     Viktor E. Hampel, Hampel Consulting
</h3>
     A Consumer Protection Act for Digital Products
     (Proposal for an International Standard on the
     Labeling of Digital Products)
<p>
     Mr. Hampel reported that accountability had been
     unanimously agreed upon as the key issue for
     electronic commerce during panel discussions of the
     recent international elecro-optical engineering
     conference in Philadelphia, which included
     representation from such diverse groups as NSA and the
     electronic publishing association. To promote
     accountability in electronic transactions, Mr. Hampel
     proposed the labeling of digital products in a
     structured header to protect the intellectual property
     rights of providers -- equivalent to the visual
     copyright notices found on title pages of bound
     literary works. The descriptive digital product labels
     in the header would uniquely identify their source and
     contents and thus also help consumers decide what
     products they wish to see, hear, buy and use --
     equivalent to the *visual* food labels on containers.
     According to Mr. Hampel's proposal, the proposed
     structures of the information header could be based on
     the international CALS Standards for the enveloping of
     digital data products, and on FIPS PUB 188 for the
     labeling of data. International standard for certified
     Public-Key digital signatures would bind the header
     information to the registered digital product to
     protect its integrity and authenticity.
<p>
<h2>
VI.  Wrap-up and Adjourn
</h2>
     Questions from the audience during the wrap up session
     included:
<p>
     What is the current time line for implementing the
     policy?
<p>
     The response was today if the draft criteria is met an
     export license can be obtained. Final policy can be
     expected in a few months since the last thing the
     Administration wants are criteria which preclude
     solutions to things government or industry needs.
<p>
     If a message is sent to 187 countries, where does the
     Data Recovery Center (DRC) have to be located?
<p>
     The response was that the escrow center could be in
     the U.S. or another country with which the U.S. has
     appropriate law enforcement and national security
     arrangements. However, the agent has to be certified.
<p>
     When and how will the policy be published?
<p>
     The Administration hopes to be completed in a few
     months and since the policy is a loosening of
     restrictions it does not have to go in the Federal
     Register for comment. Final implementation is likely
     to be a notice with criteria in the Federal Register.
<p>
     Several questions centered around the requirement for
     a SECRET clearance for at least one person for each
     Certified Escrow Agent.
<p>
     Responses included information that the person with
     the clearance does not have to run the DRC but can
     hold any position and standards will have to be
     developed for the certifying process. Other issues
     revolved around multinational companies which may be
     in compliance for 25% U.S.-owned one day and the next
     day may not be within the legal limits.
<p>
<p>
     Overall, the meeting did appear to help clarify the
     draft criteria for participants. No new significant
     issues were raised.
