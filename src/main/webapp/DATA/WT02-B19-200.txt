<b>General Information and Eligibility Requirements</b><p> 
 
	The  Foundation for Exceptional children is accepting applications for the Stanley E. Jackson Scholarship Awards (Awards 1 through 4, below) and Infinitec Scholarship Award (Award 5, below) to be applied toward full-time, post-secondary education or training during 1997-1998.  
Post-secondary education or training includes two and four year undergraduate college programs or vocational, technical or fine arts training programs.<p> 
 
The <b>Stanley E. Jackson Scholarship Awards</b> honor Stanley E. Jackson.  Mr. Jackson was a pioneer and leader in the special education community.  The <b>Infinitec Scholarship Award</b> is sponsored by Infinitec, Inc., a joint project of United Cerebral Palsy Association of Greater Chicago and UCPA, Inc., the national organization.  The aim of Infinitec, Inc. is to enable people with disabilities to gain access to technologies that advance independence.<P>

<b>Applicants must be anticipating enrollment for the first time in full-time, post-secondary education or training during 1996-1997 and provide evidence of financial need.  </b>Different recipients will be selected for 
each award category. <b> No person will receive more than one award, and past recipients are ineligible for current or future awards.</b><p> 
 
	The following criteria must be met for each award:<p> 
 
<b>Award #1:</b>	Applicant must be disabled.<p> 
<b>Award #2:</b>	Applicant must be disabled and also be a member of an ethnic minority group, such as Afro-American, Hispanic, Native American or Asian.<p> 
<b>Award #3:</b>	Applicant must be disabled and have also demonstrated gifted and/or talented abilities in any one or more of the following categories: general intellectual ability, 
specific academic 				aptitude, creativity, leadership, or visual or performing 
arts.<p> 
<b>Award #4:</b>	Same as Award #3 and also be a member of an ethnic minority 		
	group, such as Afro-American, Hispanic, Native American or 			Asian.<p> 
<b>Award #5:</b>	Applicant must use an augmentative communication device or other technology-based alternative to oral communication.  Qualifying communications devices and systems range along a continuum from simple picture boards to highly complex computer-based systems.<p> 
 
	To complete the application process for any of these scholarship awards, the applicant must provide the 
following material:<p> 
<ul> 
<li>	Completed Scholarship Application form (2 copies)

<li>	Goals Statement (250 words) or less (2 copies) 
<li>	Statement verifying disability.  (This may be from a physician or a

All materials must be <b>postmarked no later than February 1, 1997 
</b>and sent to the Foundation for 
Exceptional Children, 1920 Association Drive, Reston, VA  20191.<p> 
	 
The confidentiality of all information provided will be respected.  All applicants will be notified as to the 
outcome of their application. <b> None of the application materials will be returned.  Additional materials (e.g.,
art work, samples of writing, tapes, videos etc.) will not be considered in the process of evaluating the 
application.</b><p> 
 
Multiple scholarship awards will be made in each of the following categories.<p> 
 
Award #1:	Scholarship Award for Students with Disabilities<br> 
Award #2:	Scholarship Award for Ethnic Minority Students with 			
	Disabilities<br> 
Award #3:	Scholarship Award for Gifted/Talented Students with 			
	Disabilities<br> 
Award #4:	Scholarship Award for Ethnic Minority Gifted/Talented 			
	Students with Disabilities<br>
Award #5:	Scholarship Award for Students with Disabilities using an augmentative communication device or other alternative communication system (Infinitec Awards), one $1,000 scholarship and one $500 scholarship award.<p> 
 

By completing this application a student will receive consideration for one of the five scholarship categories 
whose eligibility criteria are met. <b> APPLY IN ONLY ONE CATEGORY.</b>  Different recipients will be 
selected for each award category.  No person will receive more than one award.<p> 
  
<b>ASSEMBLE  INFORMATION  INTO  TWO  COMPLETE  SETS:</b><p> 
 
<b>(ONE SET </b>= One application, one copy each of three letters of recommendation, one copy of goals 
statement, and each transcript.  If transcripts are being sent separately by an institution, the Foundation will 
attach the transcripts.)<p> 
 
  
 
<b>IMPORTANT</b>- Because the application is being used for five different scholarship awards (five 
categories), applicants should complete only those questions which are relevant to their circumstances, or to the 
category of award to which they are applying.<p>
