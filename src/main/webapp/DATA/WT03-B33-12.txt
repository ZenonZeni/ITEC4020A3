Aftermath Of A Battle -- AT&T And NCR Present United Front To Reassure
Users

By  DAN RICHMAN



    New York-As the $7.48 billion takeover battle for NCR wound to a close
last week, executives of both AT&T and its soon-to-be newest subsidiary
joined arms in a new campaign: one aimed at keeping their two sets of
users happy.

    Armed with top-level promises of continued migration and product
support for all existing offerings, officials on both sides worked double
time to be as reassuring as possible.

    NCR President Gilbert P. Williamson, who has been tapped to replace
retiring Chairman Charles Exley as the NCR unit's CEO once the takeover is
complete, went out of his way to comfort AT&T buyers.

    ``We would like to assure AT&T customers that they will be fully
protected, with a full migration path to the next generation of
products,'' he said. ``We agree [with AT&T] that there will be no change
in our product direction and in the basic principles that underlie that
direction.''

    Over the next five months, AT&T and NCR officials said, a transition
planning team consisting of six to eight employees from each company will
be working constantly to try and work out all the details of the product
line merger. The planning team-to be co-chaired by Exley and AT&T Computer
Systems President Richard McGinn-will be isolated from day-to-day
operations so that their discussions do not distract routine operations.

    Most NCR and AT&T users contacted last week, however, seemed unsure
how they would act if they suddenly had to make a major Unix purchase
during the next several months, as the two companies are hammering out
their differences.

    Paul S. Sawyer, a computer specialist with the University of New
Hampshire's telecommunications department, is still using a 3B15 that he
bought in 1985 to link a network of 12 terminals and 13 MACs. Even though
his 3B15 is ``obsolete'' and he has the authorization to replace the
machine, Sawyer said he is putting off any new purchases until the merger
has concluded and ``things have settled down a little. The situation is
just too uncertain right now.''

    ``Definitely we will wait and see what happens,'' he said, referring
to the talks of product mergers. ``I want to know what they are up to
first.''

    Gordon Curr, vice president of MIS for Hyatt Hotels, was less affected
by the news. He said any concern he might have had with the effects of the
merger were offset by Hyatt's recent purchase of AT&T's RISC-based System
7000 running SVR3.0.

    ``The purchase of a Unix-based system was meant to protect me from
changes by any manufacturer,'' Curr said. ``They can introduce a whole new
product line, but as long as it's Unix, it's fine with me.''

    Michael Nolan, a Lincoln, Neb., consultant who uses NCR's I series and
a Tower and last year chaired the NCR Unix Users' Group, said he thinks
the merger will probably help NCR really develop the 3000 Series. He said
many had wondered whether NCR had sufficient resources to accomplish those
development efforts alone.

    ``Now there's no question,'' he said. ``They've sure got the cash.''

    Jim Mercer, an educational systems manager for the Law Society of
Upper Canada, said his main concern is AT&T's products.

    ``We use three 3B2s, and rumor has it that if the merger goes through,
the line goes away,'' Mercer said. ``It's so incredibly expensive to buy
parts for that it's pretty much gone away already, but if we are still
using it, it would be nice to have support. The merger really opens up the
question of whether we'll have it.''

    AT&T has promised that the 3B2s will be provided for, despite threats
some months back from Exley that NCR would close down the line were the
takeover successful. ``Those with 3B2s can rest assured that their
investment is safe,'' AT&T spokesman John Skalko said. He added that while
he won't promise that the 3B2 will not be dropped, there exists an $850
million contract with the U.S. Air Force calling for delivery of about
20,000 units from 1989 through 1994.

    ``I don't know what products will stay and which will go,'' he said.
``But we won't strand customers under any circumstances. We'll have
complete backward and forward compatibility to protect their investment.''

    Skalko also said that a 3B2 microprocessor upgrade would be announced
later this month. He declined to give details, but James Clark, vice
president of high-performance and fault-tolerant systems, early last month
referred to the 3B2s using a RISC processor and running SVR4.

    AT&T Chairman Robert Allen pledged that the months of merger planning
will not affect current computer efforts for either firm. ``The companies
will meet their revenue figures,'' he said. ``There are plenty of
competitors out there [who] are bound to be disappointed.''

    While future lines are debated privately, officials with both firms
hope users continue to make purchases even though the future is uncertain.

    ``We're not going to do anything to reduce the value of any product,
whether NCR's or AT&T's, so there's no reason at all for people to hold
off their purchases,'' said R. Elton White, currently NCR's executive vice
president of marketing and the man slated to become the president and
chief operting officer of NCR when the merger is finalized.

    White said NCR achieved record revenues during this year's first
quarter, despite widespread speculation the acquisition would occur. ``Now
that it's actually occurred, why should sales drop?'' he asked.

    Similarly, AT&T has said that its computer systems division had turned
in record orders during March and April.

    When AT&T began the takeover effort with a $90-a-share offer in
November, both companies were engaged in major strategic changes. AT&T,
which has lost an estimated $2 billion in computers and is still not
reported as profitable in the computer arena, has been making its Unix
software entity more and more independent from its hardware side with
outside minority ownership announced this year.

    NCR last year announced that it is phasing out its proprietary
machines by next year to offer up an entirely open systems line of
products. NCR executives said throughout the takeover battle that it
wanted to be left alone to try to make its new all-open systems strategy
work.

    Throughout the six-month battle to keep NCR from being taken over,
Exley personally and aggressively attacked AT&T's computer operations,
saying he did not want to ``sacrifice'' NCR to ``bail out AT&T's failed
strategy'' and that the takeover was merely a ``desperate attempt to
salvage AT&T's disastrous foray into the computer business.''

    Exley had also pledged to never oversee such a combined entity and,
indeed, announced he'd retire several months early to avoid being at the
helm.

    At a news conference last week announcing the $110-a-share deal, Exley
smiled, said nice things about AT&T and avoided several questions about
his previous statements.

    ``It's amazing how some of those [comments] have faded from my
memory,'' Exley told reporters. AT&T's Allen shot back, ``It hasn't faded
from my memory.''

    While the deal was announced as an all-stock swap, the agreement sets
a variety of upper and lower limits that are tied into stock market
fluctuations. A government requirement or unfavorable stock market
activity could change the deal to one involving stock and cash.

NCR To Roll Out Commercial OLTP Parallel Machine

By  PAUL KRILL



    New York-NCR plans to launch here today a full-scale assault on the
mainframe market, with the introduction of a Unix-based commercial OLTP
computer that can reach performance of 2,000 MIPS and hold as many as 288
i486 processors.

    Called the NCR 3600, the parallel multiprocessor system has base
prices ranging from $855,000 for a basic unit with 30 to 35 processors, to
$8 million for a 288-processor system. NCR said the system has a
cost-per-MIPS rate of less than $5,000, vastly below that of conventional
mainframes. Processors are used for both applications processing and other
functions such as parallel database management.

    The multiple-cabinet-based unit can hold as much as 300 gigabytes of
disk storage, has a total system bandwidth of more than 12 gigabytes per
second, I/O bandwidth of 3.8 gigabytes per second and more than 380 SCSI
I/O channels, NCR said. NCR plans to make the unit available in September.

    The 3600 reportedly processes as many as 256 transactions per second,
a figure recorded in December 1990. ``I'm surprised that TPS isn't
higher,'' given the size and speed of the system, said Robert Kidd, an
analyst with San Jose-based Dataquest.

    George Lindamood, an analyst with the Gartner Group in Stamford,
Conn., however, called the 3600 a significant development.

    ``There have been other parallel processing machines, but this is the
first one intended for commercial, mission-critical applications, and not
just for use by tinkerers in a scientific environment,'' he said. ``This
is the most significant move into the mainstream by parallelism.''

    NCR is planning a follow-on release of the 3600 in 1992 that would
exceed speed of 10,000 MIPS, offer 1,000 gigabytes of storage and process
more than 1,200 transactions per second.

    The system, part of the NCR System 3000 family, incorporates Unix
System V.4, high-speed intelligent interconnect technology and a scalable
architecture, NCR said. The company is claiming that users can expect 99.9
percent availability and scalable relational database capabilities to
monitor and analyze operations.

    NCR is using a technology called message-passing parallelism, which
manages the computer's internal network by communicating interrelated
messages dealing with requests, status of work in process and results.
Tasks are handled by a high-speed intelligent interconnect technology
called Ynet, licensed from Teradata.

    Each processor runs its own copy of the operating system. This enables
the processors to perform other functions while waiting for messages or
replies from the network, NCR said.

    The unit features application processors (APs), which group several
486 processors together for application processing, and access module
processors (AMPs). The AMPs are also 486 processors that are used to
handle parallel database functions and support recovery facilities of the
3600 parallel database.

    NCR has established relationships with Sybase and Teradata in
developing the 3600.

    Omri Serlin, editor and publisher of the FT Systems newsletter
(fault-tolerant), said the 3600 presented ``a very interesting
architectural concept.'' But NCR failed to provide many benchmarks, he
added.

    ``When I start to see some performance benchmarks that are
outstanding, then I will become a true believer,'' Serlin said.

    He questioned, however, whether the system actually achieves 2,000
MIPS. ``They're simply counting every processor that can be put in and
attaching the peak theoretical performance,'' Serlin said.

    ``The big issue is, `Can you put all these processors to effective
use?' '' he said.

    Kidd said the 3600 ``kind of walks rings around everything in the
market'' insofar as raw performance is concerned. ``This is complex, very
inventive technology. The user could be confused by it,'' he said.

    Gene Manno, president and CEO of rival Arix, said the machine would
hurt sales of rival 486 users Sequent Computer Systems and Unisys. ``This
machine's going to eat Sequent's lunch,'' he said.

    But Sequent spokesman Grant Kimball said he did not see Sequent
competing against the NCR machine. ``It looks like a very large machine,
and there are other massively parallel machines out there that Sequent
never sees'' when competing for sales, he said.

    Arix's Manno said that NCR is apparently planning to position the
machine as a database platform. While the new NCR system might do well
there, Manno contended that many applications might not see that much
improved performance, simply because the workload on many applications
can't be shared using the configuration NCR appears to be using.

    ``If you have Lotus on a number of PCs, it probably won't run that
much faster than it does on a single processor,'' he said.

    Arix makes the Arix System 90, a parallel multiprocessing
supercomputer running Unix, which can be configured using up to 86
processors.

    Manno said that it appeared that the NCR system devoted a huge portion
of its processing power to keeping one copy of the operating system
running on each processor.

    ``This thing will look like 288 PCs on a LAN,'' Manno said. ``If you
took 288 486 PCs, it would run just as fast. It just looks like a tightly
coupled LAN, but all the processors are in one big box.''

    He added a contention that the use of Microchannel buses might create
a data bottleneck.

Supernet Test Set

By  LEE BRUNO



    Los Alamos, N.M.-In an experiment aimed at allowing people to share
and access high-end graphic visualization and animation files at speeds as
much as 160 times faster than Ethernet networks, four supercomputing
centers in the U.S. will be linked to one another this summer over a
high-speed fiber-optic network.

    But users and vendors agree that this summer's linkup will be only the
first step on a road that will likely lead to a quantum leap in speed for
network users, offering a glimpse of systems that in just a few years will
be high-speed information pipelines linking supercomputers to desktop
worksta

    tions. Once in place, users could see and interpret massive data files
in real time.

    This summer's test, called the Casa subgroup, is one of five tests
aimed at using gigabit networks funded by the Corporation for National
Research Initiative-a national effort aimed at exploring the possibilities
of upgrading the Internet to gigabit networks within the next 10 years.

    Experiment participants say the combined effort marks a milestone in
the future of high-speed networks and lays the foundation for the
technology that some estimate will be in the hands of commercial users
three to five years from now.

    Participants were the San Diego Supercomputing Center, NASA's Jet
Propulsion Labs, Los Alamos National Labs and the California Institute of
Technology.

    Essentially, the technology, called the High Performance Peripheral
Interface (HIPPI), is expected to help unclog the network bottleneck and
provide a pathway for supercomputers to pass data to workstations in real
time so that users can interact with massive data sets.

    Graphics users today often find it difficult visualizing large amounts
of data, such as reviewing seismic studies for oil exploration. Currently,
users are unable to effectively interact and model such data, which can be
as large as 30 gigabytes. The goal is to be able to link a supercomputer
such as a Cray over a high-speed network to a workstation, and then render
the data in 3-D while the supercomputer continues doing the intensive
computational tasks it is built for.

    For example, the ability to apply complex algorithms in shorter
periods of time to seismic data collected from a potential oil field would
give an oil company a strong competitive advantage over its competitors,
said Jeff O'Neil, director of reservoir computing at ARCO Oil and Gas in
Plano, Texas.

    ``It takes time to apply those algorithms, and the faster you can
apply those algorithms, the better results you can come up with,'' O'Neil
said. ``It means coming up with the better answer and being able to see
something that no one else has seen.''

    Today, that processing can take as long as six months to a year,
O'Neil said, but the greater bandwidth that HIPPI technology offers could
bring that down to a few months. For most similarly complex projects,
O'Neil estimates, the HIPPI effort should reduce processing time as much
as 75 percent.

    ``It is imperative that we make some dramatic improvements in the next
few years'' in the area of high-speed networks moving large amounts of
data, said Bob Judd, group leader of the computer graphics group C6 at Los
Alamos National Laboratories, one of the experiment participants.
``Ethernet just seems barely able to handle network video bandwidth.''

    One of the objectives of the HIPPI effort involves scientists who need
to share large graphic images over networks, something that today's
1-to-2-Mbyte-per-second Ethernet traffic makes all but impossible and, at
best, impractical.

    The HIPPI technology potentially can handle the large stream of data
used in animation and high-end visualization types of applications, Judd
said. For example, a single 24-bit color frame for a
1,000-by-1,000-resolution graphic image can use as much as 3 Mbytes of
memory. If a user wanted to run those images at 30 frames per second, the
throughput required for the network would be somewhere around 90 Mbytes
per second.

    Greg Chesson, chief scientist of research and development at Silicon
Graphics, projects that in three to five years, the HIPPI technology will
exist for networks that he expects to carry more than 100 Mbytes of data
per second.

    But he added that he found it ``hard to believe that these [future]
networks will be based solely on HIPPI technology.''

    At the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, they are using a
HIPPI interface to connect a Thinking Machines supercomputer to an
Ultranet 1-gigabyte network.

    ``We're expecting that a lot of the high-end workstations will begin
having the HIPPI interface,'' said Jim McCabe, project leader for the
network development group for the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation program
at the Computer Science Corp. for NASA Ames.

    In a couple of years, McCabe said, he expects to connect to Ultranet
and get a 400-Mbyte-per-second data transfer rate.

    Today's leading workstation vendor, Sun Microsystems, agrees that
HIPPI is the current obvious choice for linking supercomputers to
workstations.

    But Sun, which is currently considering building an Sbus HIPPI
interface, has some concerns about how well HIPPI would do for its
customers in today's networks. ``The ability to construct a host interface
is only half of the solution,'' said Geoffrey Baehr, Sun's director of
networking and communication. ``One needs a low-cost high performance
switch.''

    Baehr said there is a great degree of difficulty building a HIPPI
switch and making it affordable to the $5,000 workstation user.

    As computational power increases, people are willing to develop
applications that allow the data to flow to the specific engine best
suited for tackling the data. And then the data has to be moved to the end
user in near real time. ``That puts a tremendous demand on the network,''
Baehr said.

    SGI scientist Chesson said that until users have routine access to
HIPPI, there are a variety of ways of accelerating graphics transfer
efforts, such as data compression.

Users Divided On Value Of X Terminals

By  PAUL KRILL



    San Jose-Dr. Stanley Nel, dean of arts and sciences at the University
of San Francisco, has had some second thoughts about the university's
decision last year to buy 30 X terminals instead of workstations for the
school's computer science and math departments.

    ``Everybody seems to be pointing to a distributed computing
environment as the paradigm for the future. For a distributed computing
environment, by definition one needs a local CPU,'' Nel said. Shrinking
prices are making workstations more viable than X terminals, he said.

    But Reginald Beardsley, of Plano, Texas-based ARCO Information
Services, said X terminals are ``fabulous,'' enabling him to log into
several different systems at once.

    ``For certain applications, I don't think that you can beat them,''
said Beardsley, whose company develops oil exploration software.


    Beardsley said he is responsible for release management of an internal
interface product on several different platforms. Sometimes he is logged
onto an IBM RISC System/6000, a Sun Microsystems SPARCstation, a Digital
Equipment DECstation and a Silicon Graphics workstation at the same time.
``I can just move from window to window firing off compiles,'' he said.

    The different viewpoints of Beardsley and Nel illustrate an
approaching dilemma: With the almost weekly introduction of new,
higher-powered X terminals and lower-priced workstations from major
vendors, users are finding themselves making difficult comparisons between
now similar technologies.

    San Jose-based Dataquest projects volume shipments of X terminals to
grow from 69,000 in 1990 to 861,200 in 1995. But workstation and X
terminal users remain divided over the usefulness of X terminals in
client/ server computing.

    X terminals eliminate a lot of system administration and are suitable
for users who do not need a lot of display bandwidth, Beardsley said. But
some believe they are a poor man's workstation and a return to the days of
timesharing.

    Meanwhile, proponents argue that X terminals are a low-cost seat for
users not requiring a compute-intensive desktop system. And the cost of a
fully configured workstation still makes X terminals a clear-cut cheaper
alternative, they say.

    ``I think [X terminals are] a better solution because you're able to
share the power of a workstation. All of your applications do not
necessarily require full-blown workstations,'' said Dennis Mahbeer, who
uses Hewlett-Packard X terminals as a CIM engineer at Northern Telecom in
Montreal.

    ``Just about everybody we have is on an X-Window terminal,'' he said.

     `If you don't need the CPU for one reason or another, [X terminals]
provide better performance in our experience than upgrading a PC or a
Mac.'    Mahbeer said the company uses the terminals as real-time shop
floor interfaces. The shop has about 90 terminals running off of four HP
9000 models 380 and 845 servers.

    To prevent bottlenecks between the terminals and servers, Northern
Telecom uses Ungerman Bass bridges that connect various segments of the
LAN and keep X packet traffic from going out over the whole network.

    The company has had some difficulties with X terminals. Mahbeer said
when the terminals were shut off and restarted, the server did not always
respond to it. Northern Telecom has been updating its X display manager
software to correct the problem, he said.

    Hamish Reid, a senior software engineer at Sybase, in Emeryville,
Calif., said X terminals are economical for the company. Reid said his X
terminal is connected to a Sun SPARCstation 1 and is used for database
development, programming and debugging.

    ``We have Sequents and workstations. We can't afford workstations for
everybody, but we have X,'' said Reid, who added he was not speaking for
the company.

    He said he did not see workstation prices ever being as low as X
terminal prices. But many engineers prefer workstations to X terminals, if
only for prestige, Reid said. Sybase uses NCD and Visual Technology X
terminals.

    X terminals consist primarily of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, X
graphics processor and X server software. Prices generally range from
about $985 for Visual Technology's X-14/es to $8,200 for a 19-inch color
IBM XStation 130. Workstations, priced as low as $5,000 in a diskless,
monochrome configuration, usually have all the facilities of X terminals
but add high-powered CPUs and disk drives. They can cost more than
$100,000 with various options included.

    Patty Chang, an analyst with San Jose-based Dataquest, said X
terminals are complementary to workstations and both should grow together.
``An X terminal is not designed for computing-intensive applications,''
she said. ``It's for multiple applications on one screen.''

    Bill Carrico, president and CEO of NCD, said X terminals are designed
to display the output of a server at a lower cost. ``Essentially, NCD aims
to have the X terminal cost one-half the list price of whatever the
comparable workstation would be,'' he said. Drew Davis, channels marketing
manager at Tektronix, said X terminals provide a specialized node in a
collective computing environment, offering a common standard user
interface to access network resources.

    However, a workstation user at a Midwest-based defense contractor, who
preferred anonymity, said his division frowned on X terminals after trying
some DEC terminals. ``They were using 80 percent of the CPU and doing
nothing,'' he said. The company wanted to use the terminals for software
engineering, but instead uses them for general office work.

    ``It makes more sense to us to spend the extra $1,000 or $2,000 and
buy a diskless workstation,'' he said.

    Phil Serra, a software analyst at Ivac, a San Diego-based medical
equipment builder, also had reservations about X terminals. ``The
performance is OK [but] if you're going to put a lot of them on the
server, it's really going to degrade the performance of the server,'' said
the Sun workstation user.

    Serra said X terminals can be used for viewing schematics and data and
checking functions. Designers, however, need either a workstation or an X
terminal with a powerful server, he said.

    ``The X terminal is sort of a step backward'' in that it reverts back
to a centralized computing paradigm, Serra said.

    Nel at USF said he has questioned the value of X terminals because of
their lack of independent processing power and what he sees as a
diminishing price difference vs. workstations. The university bought 30
IBM X terminals last year and connected them to a couple of IBM RISC
System/6000 servers.

    He said an X terminal is fine if a user needs high-intensity graphics
and can afford a $3,000 to $6,000 price tag. But a standalone system
provides distributed computing power.

    ``This is going to become even more of an issue as one finds the DOS
world, for example, supplying us with X-Window software,'' he said. A
system such as a 486-based Intel machine provides a low price point and
independent processing, Nel said.

    Beardsley, while an X terminal advocate, said they ``are still a
little bit on the pricey side.'' He added that running too many X
terminals off a server can cause system bottlenecks. There should be no
more than four terminals to a workstation, he said.

    Beardsley said he gave up a SPARCstation so he could keep an NCD X
terminal. ARCO Information Services also uses workstations from Sun,
Digital Equipment, Silicon Graphics and other companies plus about a dozen
X terminals, which are being used mostly by summer hires.

    David B. Lewis, a partner in Lewis, Trachtenburg & Associates, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based X and Motif consulting house, said X terminals
provide the graphics necessary for software development or X development.
Their price advantage, though, is diminishing, he said.

    ``Some of the X terminals that are currently on the market are as
expensive as some of the workstations that you can pick up, and this is
increasingly true with some of the SPARC clones that are coming out,''
said Lewis, who has used a Visual X terminal in a network of Sun and DEC
hardware.

    ``If you don't need the CPU for one reason or another, [X terminals]
provide better performance in our experience than upgrading a PC or a
Mac,'' he said.

    Ira Winston, an X terminal user at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia, said X terminals still are a substantial bargain when
compared to workstations. Prices of workstations are driven up sharply
when disk space and system administration costs are figured in, he said.

    Winston said he has an NCD X terminal at his home that links with a
SPARCstation workstation in his office. Students at the university use X
terminals for applications such as electronic mail, text processing and
office automation, he said. ``If they're running things that are not very
compute-intensive, then an X terminal is fine,'' he said.

Data General Breaks Clear

By  EVAN SCHUMAN



    Westboro, Mass.-Thanks to treble growth in sales of its Unix-based
computers and extensive cost-cutting, resulting in thousands of layoffs,
Data General has tallied up its second consecutive profitable quarter
after five years of unprofitability.

    With some Wall Street analysts saying financial figures released by
Data General suggest that the next several quarters will likely also be
profitable, this could very well mean a new lease on life for the onetime
all-but-written-off minicomputer maker. And many Wall Street analysts are
attributing the company's apparent turnaround to open systems.

    While it is not believed that two consecutive profitable quarters mean
the end of DG's financial difficulties, the news is expected to give the
DG sales force breathing room to sell to customers without having to
overcome the perception of imminent bankruptcy.

    The second-quarter earnings report showed a $19.2 million profit for
the quarter, compared with an $8.6 million loss for last year's identical
quarter. The report for the year's first fiscal quarter-announced at the
end of January-showed a $12.4 million profit, compared with a $20.5
million loss for last year's identical quarter.

    The second profitable quarter follows seven consecutive quarterly
losses for DG. Even before that, the company's financial results were
uneven, with quarterly losses mixed in with small quarterly profits. This
year's earnings reports follow five consecutive yearly losses that totaled
$428 million in net loss.

    ``There were certainly some viability issues last year,'' said Bill
Zastrow, DG marketing vice president for the company's AViiON
workstation/server Unix line.

    But the earnings were startling enough to prompt two of Wall Street's
more conservative investment houses-Smith-Barney and Salomon Bros.-to
upgrade DG stock to a buy recommendation.

    In Salomon's report to investors, analyst Steven Milunovich suggests
that the recommendation may catch investors by surprise. ``We are
upgrading the stock to a buy. Is that incredulity and skepticism we
hear?'' he wrote. ``Data General has reported two excellent quarters in a
row and analysts don't know what to do. Many of us had written off DG
along with Wang and Unisys.''

    Wall Street analysts and DG executives agree that DG's move into
profitability was achieved almost entirely through extensive cost-cutting
in research and development, sales and administrative. As is happening at
many companies today, exploratory projects-at least $10 million worth-were
canceled, and efforts were focused on core operations.

    While revenues have been mostly flat, analysts are satisfied that they
are not dropping. Indeed, AViiON sales have been steadily increasing while
the company's proprietary Eclipse MV product line have been falling,
numbers that have basically balanced each other out.

    ``They have got their costs in real good control and their revenue is
nudging through, and that's all you need,'' said Barry Bosak, Smith-Barney
managing director, who has also issued a buy advisory.

    ``I think the turnaround is real,'' said Salomon's Milunovich in an
interview, attributing much of the turnaround to DG's having made ``a
significant change in strategy to switch aggressively to open systems.''

    But Wall Street is not without its more conservative skeptics.

    ``The jury is still out,'' said Marc Schulman, a high-tech stock
analyst for UBS Phillips and Drew. ``They certainly don't belong in the
category of the Wangs and the Unisyses of the world anymore. DG will
survive, but will it survive and prosper?''

    Asked if the two good earnings reports mean that DG is in a financial
recovery, Merrill Lynch first VP George Elling said, ``It depends on how
you term recovery.''

    From an earnings perspective, he said, the company is generating more
than $300 million a quarter and has stabilized. ``But if you term recovery
in terms of whether they are growing the business, revenues grew only 1
percent,'' he said, adding that he ``would have to see some real signs
that the company is growing again'' before he would encourage people to
buy the stock.

    Elling points to staffing cut-backs from a mid-1980s com- pany high of
17,700 employees to the current 8,500, with the bulk of those layoffs in
the last two years.

    ``Can they grow with cutbacks in those areas?'' he asked. ``They took
humongous losses in the last two years,'' he said.

    UBS' Schulman credits DG executives with having hit on the correct
strategy. Not only have they focused in the area of open systems, but they
made becoming profitable an absolute priority, knowing that sales would be
hampered as long as potential customers feared DG would not be around a
few years down the road to support and upgrade today's purchases.

    Wall Street is also expecting even better financial reports from DG in
the near future because the revenue from some recent major contract
wins-including a U.S. Department of Interior contract worth as much as
$127 million and a $50 million U.S. Sprint deal-have not yet appeared in
any quarterly earnings. Also, DG is considered a front runner for two
major govern- ment contracts that have yet to be awarded: one from the
Army Reserve and one from the National Security Agency.

    What DG today considers its core strengths are the AViiON and
proprietary MV lines. Wall Street had always expected the proprietary
machines to die off as AViiON grew stronger, but what was not expected was
how slow a death that line is enduring.

    Smith-Barney's Bosak estimates that about 25 percent of the revenue
from the MV line is coming from new customers. Salomon Bros. estimates
that AViiON revenues have tripled from about $15 million in last year's
first quarter to $48 million for the current quarter, and Salomon projects
them to hit $65 million by this year's fourth quarter. Meanwhile, MV
revenues have dropped from about $158 million in last year's first
quarter, according to Salomon estimates, to about $134 million in the
current quarter, with $119 million projected for this year's last quarter.

    But unlike many of the other major RISC players, DG's AViiON strategy
is to focus almost entirely on servers under the rationale that a server
sale pulls workstations in with it. Servers also have higher profit
margins than workstations, but on the downside they need to be purchased
and replaced less frequently.

    ``Our point guard are the servers,'' said DG spokeswoman Stephanie
Bigusiak. ``The workstation market is quite full with players. We're not
so foolish to think that we can take that market over.''

    An unusual twist to the DG financial story is the resignation earlier
this month-after the announcement of the second favorable quarterly
numbers-of DG's chief financial officer, Michael Evans.

    While a CFO's resignation often signals a dissatisfied board of
directors, Evans has a strong reputation on Wall Street as a white knight
who goes into financially troubled companies, brings them to profitability
and then leaves for the next challenge.

    That's what he did at Commodore Intl., which he left in 1987 to come
to DG. Before that, he was CFO at RCA's Consumer Electronics Division, and
is now leaving DG to go to the G. Heileman Brewing Co., now in Chapter 11.

    Some are interpreting Evans' move as a sign that the hard part of DG's
financial recovery is over.

    ``I obviously am a person who likes challenges, and I am still
relatively young at 46,'' Evans said in an interview about his
resignation. ``I would have had a much more difficult decision to leave a
year ago.''

    He said that were he to have stayed at DG, the challenges would not be
as great.

    Evans characterized the DG that he arrived at as ``thoroughly
bureaucratic'' and ``bloated.'' His strategy was massive layoffs ``without
breaking the place'' and trying to maintain revenues. ``You had to be very
careful to still have the technology to bring out state-of-the-art
products,'' he said.

UI To Release Network Spec . . . -- Group's Proposed `Atlas' Distributed
Environment To Rival OSF's Net Strategy

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Parsippany, N.J.-Unix International intends next month to announce its
plans for a networking architecture to rival the Open Software
Foundation's own networking scheme, which is edging toward completion.

    The UI strategy is part of an overall plan called ``Atlas'' to expand
its system software beyond the OS, said David Sandel, UI's marketing VP.

    The upcoming announcement is part of a swirl of activity going on in
the area of network technology among UI, the OSF, and a Framingham, Mass.,
consortium, the Object Management Group:

    o  The OSF has narrowed the focus of its Distributed Management
Environment (DME) for managing software and peripherals over a network, as
the consortium moves toward an expected third-quarter announcement of what
technology it's selecting, said business-area manager Jonathan Gossels.
And the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), for running applications
over a heterogeneous network, is moving toward third-quarter release as it
goes into final testing over the summer.

    o  The OMG, a consortium of major hardware and software vendors, is
working for summer completion of its efforts to create standards for
object-oriented programming. OMG is also working to keep channels of
communication open between OSF and UI, to ensure that the three
organizations' object-oriented technologies can interoperate.

    The networking technologies are a source of new disputes between UI
and OSF, as UI claims that its technology is object-oriented while OSF's
isn't, and OSF claims that its technology is indeed object-oriented.
Meanwhile, OSF is claiming that UI has been cooperating on OSF's
specification for distributed systems management, while UI denies this.

    ``Unix International, over the last several months, has been taking a
close look at what it needs to do to put together an overall architecture
for distributed computing,'' Sandel said. ``We took the approach that we
needed an architecture, not just a set of technologies.''

    Technologies to be included in the architecture are distributed system
management, interfaces for migration from TCP/IP to OSI, transaction
processing services, security features, support for connection to PC and
DCE environments, IBM System Network Architecture (SNA) and
Hewlett-Packard Network Application System (NAS).

    Requirements put together by UI would be implemented by Unix System
Laboratories, Sandel said. Or vendors can write their own elements using
APIs made public by UI in the third quarter.

    In that respect, the UI proposal is like OSF's. OSF will provide
reference implementations of its DME and DCE technologies, and will also
publish APIs and test suites for vendors to write their own compliant
applications.

    UI reference implementations are expected to be available within six
to nine months.

    Technologies that could be included in the Atlas distributed
environment include Top End transaction processing from NCR, or Tuxedo TP
from USL, an OSI implementaton from Retix and Kerberos security. ``It's
not like we're going after brand-new technology,'' Sandel said.

    The UI technology will interoperate with the Object Management Group's
specifications for object technology, according to UI. The OMG is a
consortium of vendors including Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and
others, expected to release standards for object-oriented technology this
summer.

    Object-oriented technology is at the core of a dispute between OSF and
UI. UI claims its own Atlas will be object-oriented, while DCE is not.

    ``To have object-oriented technology, you have to have the notion of
objects. You have to have the ability to manage services. DCE does not
include that,'' Sandel said.

    But the OSF's Gossels said Sandel's claims were mere handwaving, that
Sandel was not operating with a precise decision of object-oriented
technology.

    ``It's easy to say a technology will be object-oriented, but since we
have to provide working software, we have to deal with real issues, such
as, `What does it mean, how will it really behave?' ''

    Meanwhile, OSF is moving forward on DME. The consortium agreed to
support both OSI Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) and TCP/IP
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) standards for network mangement,
according to the OSF's Scope Document for the technology. Both CMIP and
SNMP would run on OSI or TCP/IP.

    The OSF has decided to exclude one area of technology it had initially
considered including: for backing up data over a network. Gossels said OSF
now considers backup technology too immature, evolving too quickly for the
consortium to standardize on.

 .  . . While OMG Mulls OOP Bids

    Framingham, Mass.-The Object Management Group expects this week to see
demonstrations of three technologies vying to be selected as foundations
for the organization's standard for object-oriented applications.

    Technology for the Object Request Broker is expected to be selected in
late July, after a recommendation by a task force at a June 4 meeting in
San Francisco, said Richard Soley, the OMG's vice president and technical
director.

    Technology submissions are in from NCR, Object Design, HP working in
conjunction with Sun, and Hyperdesk working together with DEC.

    The Object Request Broker would be the backbone of the OMG's work.
OMG's goal is to standardize technologies for software so software can be
constructed out of discrete modules-or ``objects''-which can be reused in
different applications.

    The ORB should pass requests between applications and objects.

    OMG is working with UI and OSF to ensure the technologies are
compatible. ``Down the road, it could turn into a competition, and that's
what we're trying to avoid,'' Soley said. ``That's in no one's interest.''

The SPARCs Are Flying Again With New Fujitsu Chip

    SPARC-compatible workstations operating at 29 MIPS and priced at
$5,000 could be on the market by fall, said officials at Fujitsu
Microelectronics, who plan tomorrow to announce a SPARC chip set on which
the systems would be based. The chip set will be offered in 33- and 40-MHz
versions for systems using VMEbus, Sbus or a busless architecture. Tony
Bozzini, marketing director for San Jose-based Fujitsu, said the chip
set's integrated design will enable systems integrators and
SPARC-compatible builders to offer 29-MIPS systems in the $5,000 price
range. Included in the chip set is Fujitsu's MB86903 IU/FPU, which
combines a floating-point processor and a SPARC integer unit on a single
chip. The set also includes APD's MB86921 Cache controller, Memory
management and Tag RAM chip, the CMT. Supporting cache sizes up to 256k
bytes, the CMT links the IU/FPU to the Mbus, a local processor-to-memory
interconnect that allows a system designer to reconfigure a design to
support faster CPUs and new peripherals as they become available. Samples
of the new chip set should be available by early summer. Prices begin at
$1,295 each, in quantities of 1,000 for a four-chip set for busless
designs.

English Molecular Visualization Package Coming To U.S.

    A British software product that until now has seen only limited,
academic use is expected to make its commercial debut tomorrow with the
unveiling of a port to Hewlett-Packard's Apollo 9000 Series 700
workstations. Ports to four other Unix platforms are also planned. PIMMS,
produced by U.K.-based Oxford Molecular, is slated to be announced
tomorrow. PIMMS is a GUI-based program, intended for use by pharmaceutical
companies, chemical engineers and materials researchers, that allows the
visualization and design of molecules. PIMMS will be ported to Silicon
Graphics and to RS/6000 machines by the end of the summer, and to
SPARCstations 1 and 2 by year-end, said David Marsh, Oxford Molecular's
technical manager. A port to FPS Computing's FPS 500
SPARCsupercomputer-the only supercomputer on which PIMMS will be
available-is planned for completion by year-end. The port has been delayed
by several months from its planned start date in February by FPS' pending
release of a new cross-compiler, Marsh said. On any of these platforms,
PIMMS can be licensed for 5,000 pounds (about $9,000) per 20 users, with
an additional 15 percent of the license fee for support and maintenance.

Netwise Adding More Wise To Its SNA Product

    Look for Netwise to roll out enhancements to its SNA connectivity
products in the fall or so, said Bill Jacobs, director of product
marketing. Netwise is the developer of a line of products based on Open
Network Computing (ONC) Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), allowing
applications to be written to run in modules spread over a network. The
company makes an RPC Tool for developing distributed applications on Unix,
Sun Microsystems and PC platforms as well as for System Network
Architecture (SNA) mainframes. Enhancements to the RPC Tool are expected
to address the fact that SNA has been implemented in different,
non-standardized fashions on non-Blue platforms. The new RPC tool is also
expected to tighten the link between TCP/IP on one hand and SNA networking
protocols such as Token Ring on the other. Netwise said that users will be
able to administer the technology remotely. Users will be able to choose
between command-line or graphical interface.

DEC, Intel Intro PC

By  MITCH WAGNER



    New York-Digital Equipment and Intel are expected tomorrow to come out
with a diskless 386 PC configured for networking, at least one laptop
computer and other networking products, officials with both companies
said.

    At a news conference featuring DEC Chairman Ken Olsen and Intel
President Andrew Grove, DEC will roll out a 26-to-27-MIPS PC priced
starting at about $6,000 in diskless configurations, targeted for use on a
network by commercial users, said two Intel sources.

    The PC will be configured to run SCO Unix Version 3.2, Unix System
V.4.2, OS/2 or DOS Version 3.3 or 4.01, one of the sources said. The
machine, which DEC is OEMing from Intel, will be available immediately,
sources said.


    It comes configured with 8 to 48 Mbytes main memory, with an
additional 16 Mbytes video RAM. It also comes configured with a SCSI bus,
for adding an external disk drive.

    The machine will be shipped with a high-resolution, VGA-compatible
1,280-by-1,024-pixel display.

    The laptop introduction will also be Intel architecture.

    The introduction follows the March 13 European announcement of laptops
from DEC based on the Intel i386SX and i386DX. Sources indicated that
Tuesday's announcement may be the American introduction of those machines.

    The PCs will not have support for DEC's Ultrix implementation of Unix
is not surprising, since Ultrix is currently configured to run only on
Mips RISC and VAX processors. On the Intel processor, DEC supports SCO
Unix implementations, with the ``applicationDEC'' line including 386 and
486 single-processor PCs, and the multiprocessor applicationDEC 433
running SCO Unix with multiprocessing extensions.

BT Revamps Unix OA Plan

    London-British Telecom has changed its plans to provide Unix-based
office automation for an estimated 30,000 users, after cutting short an
earlier project that was based on its own hardware.

    The company's BoaT OA project involves building a corporate network of
Unix servers linked by X.400 and supporting dumb terminals and PCs. Among
other features, it will allow BT to have E-mail across its offices
worldwide for the first time. BT is using Hewlett-Packard's NewWave and
OpenMail software, with Uniplex on the servers, so that it can integrate
PCs running Windows and DOS into the system.

     That level of PC integration was missing from an earlier attempt at a
Unix-based office system, called Coast, which was stopped last year.
Coast, which BT officials said still has about 1,500 users, was based on
Uniplex and dumb terminals. The hardware used was a Unix system called the
M5000 that BT was selling at the time.

     ``That didn't really address the PC community in BT,'' said Margaret
Harrison, BoaT customer services manager. The need to integrate PCs was
one reason BT decided to look for a different solution that would let PC
users stick with familiar applications but also give them new OA
facilities like E-mail.

     Another reason, she said, was that BT's Unix machines were capable of
supporting only 40 or so users apiece, but BT wanted to use more powerful
machines that could be supported by its computer services specialists.

     Under the BoaT program, BT has switched to using Unix systems from
outside suppliers. DEC, IBM RS/6000 and HP 9000 servers are being used for
three launch projects that are currently being implemented to support a
few hundred users. Harrison said no decision has yet been taken about the
servers that will be used to provide facilities for the thousands of other
prospective users.

     BoaT users will either use Uniplex via dumb terminals attached to
Unix servers or will have PCs that are linked to the servers. One
attraction of the HP software, Harrison said, was that low-end PCs could
run HP's AdvanceMail, while more powerful PCs could run the graphical
NewWave interface and NewWave Mail.

     Those PC mail systems will link to HP's OpenMail on the Unix servers,
which in turn will connect to a corporate X.400 network. Harrison also
noted that OpenMail, which is in the process of being integrated more
closely with Uniplex, is being ported to the IBM and DEC Unix systems.

    Uniplex officials said last year that Uniplex would get involved in
porting OpenMail to other systems and would get the two products to work
together more closely, initially by putting a Uniplex-style interface on
OpenMail.

    BT's plans to use HP and Uniplex software with a variety of hardware
follow an initial phase of BoaT that involved linking existing proprietary
IBM PROFS and DEC ALL-IN-1 OA systems via X.400.

Corrections

    One of the performance figures in a story about Silicon Graphics'
SkyWriter product, which appeared in the April 29 issue on p. 5, was
incorrect. It should have said that the product is capable of displaying
5,000 polygons per frame at 30 Hz with full texture mapping and filtering,
not 5,000 polygons per frame at 30 MHz.

    Also, in an article on p. 10 of the April 29 issue, Princeton
Information Ltd. was incorrectly identified as Princeton Associates.

IBM Slashes RS/6000 Prices

By  PAUL KRILL



    White Plains, N.Y.-IBM has cut prices by as much as 60 percent
throughout its RISC System/6000 workstation/server line and unveiled a new
compiler that raises the units' SPECmark performance.

    The move is viewed by some analysts and competitors as reactive to
market pressures.

    The largest price cut-$78,000-was to the model 550, which dropped in
price from $130,000 to $52,000. The price of the line's low-end model
320H, introduced in March, remained at $11,750, but the company is
including a 400-Mbyte disk drive instead of a 160-Mbyte drive. This
amounts to a $4,645 value, IBM said. Memory configurations were increased
on other systems, also.

    Unit prices listed by IBM include the system unit, memory and disk
storage and no monitor or graphical user interface. The price of the 320H,
for example, jumps to $17,972 when adding in facilities such as 19-inch
display, SCSI interface, keyboard, mouse, user interface and a FORTRAN
compiler.

    IBM announced a new version of its AIX XL FORTRAN Compiler/6000,
Version 2.2, which includes a new release of the AIX XL Run Time
Environment. The compiler will be available in September.

    The new compiler executes floating-point instructions faster than the
previous release, IBM said. Through use of the new compiler, new SPECmark
and floating-point ratings are as follows, with old ratings in
parentheses: model 320H, 41.2 SPECmarks, 66.8 SPECfp, (32.4, 45); model
520, 32.6, 52.9, (25.8, 35.7); models 530, 730 and 930, 43.4, 72.5, (34.2,
48.5); models 550 amd 950, 72.2, 119.7, (56.3, 79).

    Users who have the current FORTRAN compiler will get the new one free
of charge when it ships, according to Big Blue.

    Jeff Mason, IBM advanced workstations and AIX systems director, said
IBM dropped its prices in response to what customers wanted and to help
the company reach its goal of being the workstation market share leader by
1993. ``We've gone in and analyzed how customers use each of the machines.
We've gone into each environment and tried to tune them in the
marketplace,'' he said.

    Performance enhancements now on the drawing board involve stepping up
CPU clock rates, increasing the number of instructions in a clock cycle
and more compiler improvements, Mason said.

    Michael Goulde, analyst with Open Systems Advisors in Boston, called
IBM's announcement a clear reaction to Hewlett-Packard's new HP Apollo
9000 Series 700 workstation line. Those machines, with entry-level prices
of $11,990 and $19,900, score 57 MIPS and 76 MIPS and 55.5 SPECmarks and
72.2 SPECmarks. They were introduced March 26.

    ``There's nothing in the announcement today that reflects any change
in hardware. HP can certainly crank up its compiler technology to improve
performance as well,'' Goulde said. He said he expected price and
performance changes from Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment also.

    DEC spokesman Dave Bouffard called IBM's announcement ``a beleaguered
attempt to maintain market mind share.''

    ``They can't match the HP price/ performance, and they still don't
have anywhere in their family a low-end, high-volume machine''

    for less than $10,000, he said. Bouffard said DEC this year plans to
introduce its own higher-performance workstations and already has
workstations selling for less than $10,000.

    IBM's price reductions, he said, could hurt sales of IBM's own
mainframes and midrange AS/400 accounts.

    HP spokesman Jim Barbagallo also called IBM's moves reactive to HP.
``If you look at specifications and pricing, they're still way off the HP
mark,'' he said.

    John Loiacono, a Sun spokesman, said Sun has no plans at present to
lower prices on workstations or servers. The company had no comment on
IBM's announcements.

    Mason said the announcements were made with competitiveness in mind
but not as a straight reaction to HP's 700 series.

    IBM also announced price reductions to its RS/6000 entry-level 3-D
color graphics adapters. New prices are $2,320 on 8-bit adapters and
$4,520 on the 24-bit adapters. Previous pricing was $10,400 for a 24-bit
unit and $4,160 for an 8-bit system. With an optional Z-buffer solid
rendering feature, the 24-bit adapter costs $4,520 and the 8-bit adapter
$3,995.

    IBM separately announced the availability of engineering quality
assurance software from Valisys on the RS/6000. Valisys lets engineers
validate CATIA (Computer Graphics Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive
Application) CAD drawings to ensure a part is being manufactured according
to specifications. CATIA is an IBM logo product made by Dassault Systemes
of Paris.

    Valisys, made by Valisys of Santa Clara, also is an IBM logo product.
The product previously was available on IBM mainframes and PS/2 systems.

    The Valisys software modules will be available from IBM in mid-June
priced from $8,500 to $10,155.

Game Firm Sues Secret Service

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Austin, Texas-A company that makes games and comic books is charging
that the U.S. Secret Service seized its computers and records, thus
paralyzing the business, because investigators suspected that one employee
might be engaged in computer crime.

    The lawsuit, filed by Steve Jackson Games, paints a picture of the
Secret Service as part comically incompetent and part Orwellian in its
crackdown.

    Jackson said that investigators burst into his office early on the
morning of March 1, 1990, took everything from PCs to disk drives to a
Ziploc baggie of miscellaneous screws, as part of an investigation into
computer crime. Almost all of the equipment has since been returned, said
Jackson, but the seizure resulted in irreversible publication delays.

    The Secret Service held onto the material about three and a half
months, until June 21, causing the company to miss a critical deadline,
which set off a financial chain reaction that still has the company
reeling, Jackson said. He was forced to lay off eight of his 16 employees.
The company now employs 12 people and has revenues of $1.2 million.

    More critical than the hardware was the data contained on hundreds of
1.2-Mbyte floppy disks, three computers with internal hard disk drives,
and three or four 40-Mbyte hard disk drives, Jackson said.

    Jackson's appeals to at least be able to make copies of his data went
unheeded by the Secret Service, except for the return of about nine
floppies containing five to six Mbytes of data in June 1990, Jackson said.
The data was largely useless to the company.

    Neither Jackson nor any of his employees were ever charged, he said.

    The lawsuit, filed May 1 in Federal District Court in Austin, seeks to
extend First Amendment free-expression protections to computer
communications. It charges investigators with violating the Privacy
Protection Act of 1980, which places strict limitations on the
government's powers to search publishers' offices; and the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act and Federal Wiretap Statute. It also charges
the government with violating Fourth Amendment guarantees against
unreasonable search and seizure.

    Named in the lawsuit are the Secret Service; Assistant U.S. Attorney
William J. Cook, of Chicago; Secret Service special agents Timothy M.
Foley and Barbara Golden; and Bell Communications research assistant
manager Henry M. Kluepfel, who assisted in the search. Bringing the
lawsuit along with Jackson are Elizabeth McCoy, Walter Milliken and
Steffan O'Sullivan, New Hampshire residents who are identified in the
lawsuit as users of a computer bulletin-board system the company ran,
called ``Illuminati.''

    The BBS, named for one of the Jackson games, was used by the company
to obtain product feedback.

    Backing the lawsuit is the Cambridge, Mass., Electronic Frontiers
Foundation, founded by Lotus Development founder Mitch Kapor. The group
portrays itself as a proponent of civil-rights protections for information
systems. It has been involved in defense of several computer-crime
suspects.

    The lawsuit charges that investigators took a book manuscript and the
computer used to run Illuminati, along with two other PCs and several disk
drives, and other equipment.

    At one point, Jackson appealed to several U.S. senators and
congressmen to have the data returned, according to the lawsuit. The
legislators-including Texas senator and 1988 vice-presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen-were falsely told by the Secret Service that the seized
property had been returned, according to the law suit.

    Jackson said he has not yet calculated the financial damages, but he
estimated they reached $125,000 by the time a month had passed. He added
he was shocked by the ignorance of computer technology that the agents
displayed. ``They literally had no idea of the difference between what a
computer could do in Star Trek and what a computer could do on your
desk,'' he said in an interview.

Morris Appeal Planned

    Washington-Attorneys for Robert Tappan Morris, the former Cornell
University graduate student convicted last year of unleashing the
so-called ``Internet Worm'' in 1988, have decided to appeal Morris'
conviction to the United States Supreme Court.

    ``I'm going to tell them the court was wrong,'' said Morris attorney
Thomas Guidoboni. Beyond that, he said, he had not formulated the grounds
for the appeal.

    The court could be expected by fall to decide whether to take the case
and, if the court takes it, it would likely be heard within about a year.

    A U.S. Court of Appeals panel upheld Morris' conviction in March.
Morris was convicted in January 1990 and later sentenced to serve three
years' probation, more than a year of which has already been served. He
was also sentenced to perform 400 hours' community service and pay a
$10,000 fine.

    Morris was convicted of one count of fraud for unleashing a worm virus
on the Internet in November '88, while he was a 22-year-old graduate
student.

    Thousands of Unix systems tied together on the Internet crashed when
Morris' worm duplicated itself uncontrollably due to a programming error.

    In order to convict someone under the computer fraud statute,
prosecutors must show that a defendant knowingly entered a system without
authorization and damage resulted.

    Guidoboni argued that Morris was not exceeding his authorized access
to Internet, but used common programs like sendmail and finger. The lower
court rejected those arguments.

Demax Tool Monitors System Security

By  MICHAEL FADEN



    San Mateo, Calif.-VMS security software specialist Demax Software
plans by year-end to ship a set of Unix security and network management
tools that the company says will constantly monitor system security.


    Demax has developed Unix equivalents of the security software it
currently offers on DEC VAX minicomputers running VMS and is preparing to
introduce the new software on June 6, along with Sun Microsystems. Product
manager Tanya Candia said the first version will run on Sun workstations,
followed by ports to other workstations.

    The current products include Securepak, a management tool for
individual machines that lets administrators build a ``baseline'' security
system and then monitor and analyze activity on the system, and Securemax,
a complementary product that is said to let administrators manage the
security of machines on a network from a single point.

    Candia added that the current goal of the product is to support
heterogeneous networks of Unix workstations and eventually to support
networks that include both VMS and Unix systems.

    Aiming at some new Unix sites with less Unix-expert administrators,
company officials stress what they say is a comprehensive and very easy to
use GUI design, based initially on Open Look.

    The product prompts the user along with step-by-step security
instructions, allowing the user to not have to worry about overlooking or
forgetting a step.

    While Demax President Kevin Kalkhoven said last week that Demax is
``still working on pricing,'' he estimated the product's annual cost
should range from about $100-for a standalone workstation added to an
already existing site-to $3,000, which would cover a server and up to 30
workstations.

    Demax, which says it sold about 3,000 copies of its VMS security
products, was prompted to develop Unix versions when some VMS customers
started sprouting networks of hundreds of Unix workstations, Candia said.
The firm showed customers prototype Unix software, on Sun workstations
running OpenWindows, that had 60 percent of the planned final product
functionality and was encouraged by the response to continue development,
she said.

Sun OKs VAR Clone Sales

    Mountain View-Clarifying its ``you can't sell SPARC clones if you sell
Sun machines'' policy announced last month, Sun Microsystems is now saying
that it will allow its resellers to send in the clones, provided the units
are either SPARC laptops or systems built under an OEM relationship with
Sun.

    Sun, to prevent channel conflict, last month began prohibiting Sun
resellers in the United States from also selling SPARC-compatibles, also
known as clones. SPARC laptops are being exempted because Sun itself does
not build any, while OEM systems are allowed because they are built
through partnering with Sun, company officials said.

    The rule means SPARC laptop vendors such as RDI, TriGem and Toshiba
and OEM firms such as Xerox can use the same reseller channels as Sun. RDI
qualifies under both exemptions: It buys system boards from Sun under an
OEM pact.

    Sun, in banning VARs from simultaneously selling both clones and Sun
systems, wants clone makers to broaden the base of SPARC by developing
their own channels, Sun spokesman John Loiacono said.

    Kam Chan, president of SPARC-compatible workstation builder Tatung
Science and Technology, called Sun's policy contradictory. ``They try to
open up the SPARC architecture. At the same time, they try to close up the
market,'' he said.

DEC RISC Box Gets Plaudits -- Most Beta-Site Users Pleased, Laud New
DECstation's Performance, Expandability

By  PAUL KRILL



    Mountain View-Digital Equipment's new RISC workstation has gotten good
reviews from its initial beta sites, with users touting the machine's
performance and daughter-card-based CPU upgrade strategy.

    The new DECstation ``met all of our expectations,'' said Brad Krebs, a
programmer analyst in the CAD Center at the University of California,
Berkeley.

    ``We liked the speed, we liked the expandability of it and being able,
when the next version of the CPU comes out, to replace it with a daughter
card instead of having to replace the whole damn box.''

    DEC late last month introduced two new workstations, the DECstation
5000/120 and the DECstation 5000/125, to fill a price gap between the
company's high- and low-end machines. Code-named ``3MIN,'' the units
feature daughter-card upgrade paths that will enable CPU swaps through the
replacement of pocket-sized daughter cards.

    Model 120, priced at $6,495 in a diskless configuration, features a
20-MHz Mips R3000A RISC processor. The box runs at 13.9 SPECmarks, 21.7
MIPS and 2.6 MFLOPS. Model 125, in a diskless base configuration costing
$8,495, has a 25-MHz R3000A and is rated at 16.4 SPECmarks, 26.8 MIPS and
3 MFLOPS. Various graphics options are available for each model.

    Krebs said the college used a model 125 with 128 Mbytes of memory as a
CPU server, for use in designing integrated circuits. He noted the
system's 50-Mbytes-per-second Turbochannel I/O bus was slower than the
100-Mbytes-per-second I/O of the DECstation 5000/200, but this did not
affect users.

    Tom Furlong, DEC RISC workstations manager, said the slower
Turbochannel bus was sufficient for the unit and was used to keep price at
a minimum. The 50-Mbytes-per-second system only needs one bank of dynamic
memory, while a 100-Mbytes-per-second unit needs at least two, he said.

    Krebs said the university has ordered 20 of the new workstations.

    Katy Moore, platform marketing manager at beta user Autodesk, said the
CPU upgrade paths are important to the company's AutoCAD software users,
who upgrade systems as new versions of AutoCAD are developed. She said the
workstation was fast and ``seemed to be reliable.''

    Not all reaction was glowing, however. One beta user, who asked that
his name and company affiliation be withheld, called the 3MIN box ``just
another workstation.'' He had a model 120 that was used for application
development.

    The user noted the new workstation lacks the power of
Hewlett-Packard's new HP Apollo 9000 Series 700 workstations, which run at
57 MIPS and 76 MIPS in different configurations.

    ``If I had my choice, at the present moment I'd probably look
seriously at HP,'' he said.

    A beta user at Chevron Information and Technology of La Habra, Calif.,
who also requested his name be withheld, said the new workstation was
faster than a model 3100. But he said DEC's $3,995 upgrade program to
convert a model 3100 into a model 120 was too expensive. The model 3100 is
rated at 11.8 SPECmarks, 16.2 MIPS and 1.7 MFLOPS.

    ``For $4,000, it's a lot of money for not much improvement,'' he said.

    The user said he disliked Ultrix because it was less standard and did
not write to disk as fast as Sun's SunOS.  He also said he was
dissatisfied with the performance of the model 3100. He did, however like
the X-Window performance of the DEC system.

    Kevin Scully, systems and technology manager at Sumitomo Bank Capital
Markets in New York, said he was pleased with the memory expandability of
the model 120, which can hold as much as 128 Mbytes of RAM. He said he
tested a unit but was not a beta user. He also liked the CPU upgrade path.
Sumitomo plans to order 96 3MIN boxes for its London and New York offices,
he said. ``We think that Digital is just going to have a winner with
them,'' he said.

New NCD Machines Double As Character Terminals

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Mountain View-Network Computing Devices has rolled out two new X
terminals that it says aren't really X terminals at all.

    The new MWT15b and MWT19 monochrome terminals-which are not suited for
graphics-contain both client and server X software located within the
desktop units. What that means, said NCD executive vice president Judy
Estrin, is that users can utilize the products in place of ASCII
terminals. Users can run multiple windows of character applications within
the X terminals.

    Priced starting at nearly $1,700, the two X terminals are far more
expensive than the character terminals they are designed to replace, which
can be had for less than $400. Larger installations might also require a
terminal server, priced at several thousand dollars.

    But Estrin said the price of the MWTs is worth it for users who are
committed to making the switch to X-but not switching immediately.

    ``If they're going to go to X over the next year or two, they can make
a hardware investment now, and the hardware investment is safe. You make
the hardware investment now, and later you turn on software code, and it
turns on X.''

    Another reason to buy the multiwindow terminals is if the capacity to
run several sessions in windows on a single screen is very important,
Estrin said. That kind of capacity can save seconds per call in a
telephone order-entry operation. Those kinds of time savings can add up
pretty fast, she said.

    ``Even hot-keying between different screens is different from having
multiple windows and being able to cut and paste between windows,'' she
said. The terminal can be connected to an Ethernet network via
twisted-pair or ThinWire Ethernet connection, replacing an ASCII terminal
without requiring any changes to host software or applications. Each
window on the X terminal emulates a VT220 terminal session.

    The terminals are designed to  offer a practical migration path for
users planning to eventually make use of X-Window technology. The new
desktop products can be made into true X terminals, capable of simple
graphics processing, by changing the software, Estrin said.

    The MWT15b is priced at $1,695 and the MWT19 at $3,400.

    ``There's a lot of users that, when you say X, they get nervous and
say, `Oh, that means I have to do host upgrades,' '' Estrin said.
``Because our terminals have the local window manager and software, you're
able to get a step closer to the network computing X model without having
to take the full step yet. The hardware lets you know that, in the future,
all you have to do is flip a software switch and you're there.''

    Users can upgrade the Multi Window Terminals to regular X terminals
simply by changing software, paying a $50 software license to NCD, said a
company spokeswoman.

    The 15-inch model makes use of the same hardware platform as the
company's low-end NCD15b, while the 19-inch model uses the same hardware
as the company's midrange NCD19. The 15-inch model offers
1,024-by-800-pixel resolution, and the 19-inch has 1,280-by-1,024
resolution.

    The NCD15b is priced at $1,495, $200 less than the MWT15b because it
has 2 Mbytes less memory. The NCD19 has the same price as the MWT19.

    The terminals can be used for transaction processing, database,
spreadsheet, word processing and other office automation applications,
according to NCD.

    Users can cut and paste text between windows, resize them and iconify
them. The terminals can use the look-and-feel of Motif or Microsoft
Windows 3.0. They have a 70-Hz refresh rate and a 13-by-13-inch footprint.
Both of the models have 4 Mbytes of RAM. The terminals will be available
30 days after receipt of order.

Team Plans ONC RPC Net Utilities

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Mountain View-Five networking companies have banded together to
develop base-level networking utilities around Sun Microsystems' Open
Network Computing system of Remote Procedure Calls, with the goal of
coming out with mail and print-sharing facilities by the time of the
October Interop show.

    ``The basic premise is that we want to be able to produce an
equivalent to the PC-based network operating systems that are out there,
providing all the features, and do it on an open architecture,'' said Carl
Beame, president of Beame & Whiteside, Ontario, Canada, one of the five
companies involved in the effort.

    The other companies are Interlink, FTP Software, Intercon and TGV
Software. In an effort to keep the group lean, they have no offices, no
full-time professional staff nor even a name, Beame said.

    The utilities will be protocol-independent, and source code for the
Unix reference implementations would be made public, Beame said.

    All five companies specialize in offering TCP/IP and Network File
System (NFS) implementations for non-Unix operating systems. Beame &
Whiteside runs it for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. TGV, in Santa Cruz,
Calif., specializes in Digital Equipment VAX/VMS. FTP, which is in
Massachusetts, has offerings for DOS and OS/2. Intercon, in Herndon, Va.,
specializes in Apple Macintosh computers. Interlink, meanwhile, offers NFS
and TCP/IP for IBM MVS systems.

    FTP, Intercon, TGV and Beame & Whiteside already offer mail programs.
``What we provide is not suitable for connectivity to anything but Unix,''
Beame said. ``What we want to provide are the services over the common
base that's best for all concerned.''

    The mail- and print-sharing services will serve as a sort of test for
the organization, said David Kashtan, president of TGV Software. He said
if the companies can't succeed in bringing those technologies to fruition
by October, he'll favor abandoning the team.

    But if the October deadline is met, he said he'd favor moving on to
produce timing, authentication and other services. Among these would be
facilities for sharing devices. A Unix system, for example, would be able
to read and write data directly to a VMS disk drive, Kashtan said.

    In an effort to keep the group lean, the companies have no offices, no
full-time professional staff nor even a name.

        The services would provide a uniform look-and-feel and API over
different operating systems. They will run on top of X-Window, Kashtan
said.

    The group is not in competition with the Open Software Foundation,
which is trying to standardize basic network functions, Beame said.
``People will see us as competition. That's not our intent. We're not here
to provide standards. We're here to provide real-world applications,''
Beame said. ``But if we both end up providing the same functionality,
then, yeah, I guess we'll be in competition.''

    The technologies being worked on by the five-company group do not
overlap or compete with OSF work, say sources at the group and at OSF.

    The ONC RPCs were chosen because the technology is what the companies
are already familiar with, Kashtan said. OSF has standardized on
Hewlett-Packard RPCs for inclusion in its Distributed Computing
Environment (DCE).

Hong Kong All-in-One Bank Information

        Liu Chong Hing Bank in Hong Kong is developing an application that
uses Oracle products under Unix to give managers constantly updated,
unified information on all customer accounts. Currently, the bank tracks a
customer's loan, mortgage, savings, foreign exchange and other accounts
separately so that a customer's financial profile must be assembled
manually. ``This will give our managers a complete picture of client
portfolios, which will help them make quick, accurate decisions on loans
and other matters,'' said Sampson Tong, the bank's data processing
manager. The application, called the Customer Information File, will be
crafted using Oracle's SQLoForms, SQLoPlus and SQLoReportwriter, running
on an NCR Tower 32/700 configured as an additional application processor
on the bank's proprietary NCR mainframe. The Customer Information File
will be available for use by managers at the bank's 29 Hong Kong branches,
as well as those in San Francisco and Shanghai. Plans call for customers
eventually to be able to access information on their own accounts.

In Russia, SCO Goes From Bootlegged To Bona Fide

    As long as bootleggers are already widely distributing Santa Cruz
Operation products throughout the Soviet Union, SCO thought it might as
well get a few legitimate dollars from the generated interest. SCO has
announced its first distributor in the Soviet Union, Moscow-based Future
Technology International. FTI, which is 70 percent owned by an Austrian
company and 30 percent owned by the Soviet Informpribor Institute, will
sell and support the complete range of SCO products in the Soviet Union.
Software is widely bootlegged in the Soviet Union, and at least two
companies are openly selling illegal copies of SCO Xenix, complete with
photocopied documentation, SCO said. Plans call for FTI to deal in hard
currencies initially, with the possibility of sales in rubles in the near
future.

Frame And Matsushita Say Kanji Is A Can-Do

    Frame Technology has revealed the fruits of its joint development
agreement with Matsushita Computer Systems with the rollout of the
Japanese version of its workstation publishing software. The new software,
called Japanese FrameMaker, is a Japanese-language version of its
FrameMaker 2.1 product and allows users to create and edit business and
technical documents in both Japanese and English, Frame officials said.
Some of the key capabilities of the product are a front-end processor that
allows the phonetic Japanese characters, called Hiragana and Kanji
characters, to be entered with a English keyboard. In addition, the
software has Japanese word processing and graphics standard formats and
provides support for the Japanese Industrial Standard character set of
Kanji characters. The product is currently available in Japan from
Matsushita and runs on Panasonic BE workstations running under the
X-Window System. Frame says that, within 30 days, versions for Sun
Microsystems and Solbourne computers will be available. The software costs
585,000 yen (about $4,300) for a single floating license.

NETWORKING

If you work with the private sector, OSI might be something
nice that may someday improve or replace TCP/IP. If you work with the
government, OSI is a requirement. As they did with Unix, the bureaucrats
are demanding systems that talk OSI for new purchases.

    Let's look at how two PC network companies are dealing with this. When
I say look, I don't mean look at the physical stuff. As the joke goes, the
data sheets are shipping in volume, with product to follow. But people
swear to me this stuff is shipping-just not very much yet.

     Novell, with its new NetWare 386 Version 3.11, has an optional FTAM
(File Transfer Access and Management) module that runs on the server. This
is a responder only, and provides services like file transfer and printing
to FTAM clients. Unix naming conventions are followed, and FTAM initiators
can send, retrieve, print to Novell printers, delete, rename and read
files on the server. No mention is made of security control; surely Novell
doesn't expect FTAM users to need a NetWare user name and security
profile. Attached Novell PC users don't get access to any other FTAM
services on the network.

    This method fits with Novell's other recent releases in that NetWare
is still proprietary while providing open hooks for everyone else. As
Novell has the largest PC LAN installed base to consider, it will follow
this plan for a while. And if all new products are open and older products
are opening more and more, we have to be satisfied for now.

     Directly opposite Novell's position is 3Com (once again). While it
isn't selling the Network Operating System anymore (LAN Manager/3+Open was
given back to Microsoft, remember), it is staying active in the protocol
business.

     3Com's approach is to provide a PC OSI stack that can be loaded and
unloaded from memory when needed. All the features of its fine TCP/IP DPA
(Demand Protocol Architecture), such as Virtual Terminal, third-party
terminal emulator support, file transfer and the ability to unload RAM
when you're finished, are in the OSI package. The underlying code came
from Retix, an early OSI company, so compatibility should be no problem.
This software will work with earlier LAN Manager versions sold by 3Com and
with the newest Microsoft 2.0 version.

     With the 3Com software available either today or ``real soon now,''
you will be able to run TCP/IP, NFS, OSI, NetBIOS and Novell's IPX all at
the same time. You may not have any RAM left for an application, but you
can transfer files to and fro until your network screams for mercy.

     Are you going to run OSI as the primary protocol on your local
network? Probably not, at least not for a few more years. You may soon
need to connect to random OSI hosts, however, and the 3Com option will let
you do that more easily than the Novell option.

     It seems that OSI is slowly but surely making inroads. It's been
sneaking in with the routers and mail systems, and now your PC can speak
OSI and your server FTAM. It's a start.

The Rise Of OSI -- Users Showing Increasing Interest In Potential Of X.400

By  MICHAEL FADEN



    Fourteen years ago, a bunch of standards experts at an International
Standards Organization meeting in Sydney, Australia, decided that OSI
should be invented. Given that many say OSI has only started to spread
through the Unix world, one may at some point wonder why they bothered.


     Some vendors say that one big problem holding back the spread of OSI
is that the set of OSI protocols hasn't, up till now, really solved many
problems or offered any capabilities that you couldn't get some other way.

     Within the Unix world, TCP/IP has offered many of the advantages of
being able to network machines from different vendors that OSI is supposed
to deliver.

     Even while vendors started providing OSI on their Unix systems, some
have been recognizing the widespread adoption of the TCP/IP protocols by
implementing them on proprietary operating systems, providing another way
to link together incompatible machines. In some areas, the capabilities of
TCP/IP still outstrip OSI equivalents.

     ``With TCP/IP, you can have routers dynamically build tables. With
OSI, you don't have that, the protocol is not finalized, so you find that
you cannot build a large network dynamically,'' said Lloyd Spencer,
product manager at Sun's international center for network computing in
Grenoble, France.

     However, because the IEEE standard versions of Ethernet and Token
Ring have been adopted by ISO as OSI standards, in theory huge numbers of
people are using OSI in some form already.

     Also, in Europe, the X.25 wide-area OSI networking protocol was
supported by most national phone companies and turned out to be a better
option for many users than leasing phone lines, so that has also boosted
the number of people that are already using OSI.

     What most people mean by OSI, however, is the software that runs on
top of those basic carriers and provides everything from general transport
mechanisms to sophisticated, specialized ``application-level'' services.

     The services that actually start to provide useful and sometimes new
capabilities, vendors say, will be one of the main reasons users
eventually start buying OSI. A more immediate reason may be the
specification of OSI in government procurements.

     If one looks at the expected takeup of various OSI services, it
becomes clear that some of them are likely to take off much faster than
others. According to a recent OSI study by London consultants Ovum, by
1995 suppliers will be required to support the X.400 standard for carrying
E-mail and other information in 48 percent of shipments to large
organizations in the U.S., Britain, France and Germany.

     X.500, a directory standard that has attracted a lot of attention
recently and is often considered to be closely linked with X.400, will be
required for 23 percent of shipments, even though vendors are only now
starting to get products into the market, according to Ovum. Both X.400
and X.500 were originally defined by a committee of telecommunications
carriers called the CCITT.

     In contrast, the OSI Virtual Terminal protocol for connecting remote
terminals to different machines will be required in a mere 7 percent of
shipments, according to the study.

     One reason the expected takeup for X.400 is so high, vendors say, is
that it solves a problem that's widespread, even endemic in large
organizations, namely getting mail between incompatible systems.

     Large organizations often need a mechanism for getting mail between
IBM SNA mainframe networks, TCP/IP minicomputer nets, and Novell PC LANs,
for instance, observed John Stephenson, senior vice president of Retix,
which claims to have around 160 OEMs for its Unix OSI software.

     ``Right now, major corporations see it as a solution to a big
problem, connecting mainframes and PCs,'' said Paul Madden, president of
Alfalfa Software, supplier of a mail package that runs over both X.400 and
the SMTP mail protocol used with TCP/IP.

     ``SMTP really hasn't been accepted as a solution for corporate
E-mail,'' Stephenson said. ``It's still not available on every machine in
the corporate net.''

     To solve that problem of connecting incompatible mail systems, a lot
of vendors say they are currently backing the gateway approach. Companies
will sell you a gateway box, or software that runs on a machine you have
already, that takes proprietary mail and converts it into X.400 format.
Then, that mail could be carried on an X.400 ``backbone'' or over one of
the X.400 public mail networks that are now provided by most of the main
public carriers to another gateway box. The second gateway is connected to
another proprietary mail network and converts the X.400 mail to the new
proprietary format. Each gateway can sometimes deal with a number of
different proprietary formats.

     SoftSwitch, Wayne, Pa., offers turnkey systems based on software and
gateway boxes that it says will translate mail to and from IBM mainframe
office systems, DEC's ALL-IN-1, PC local-area network mail systems like
Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail, and Unix/SMTP mail. Coincidentally, the
gateways themselves run Unix System V, Release 3 on 80386 processors.

     Touch Communications sells gateway software that runs on Interactive
Unix systems. Typically, said Touch product manager Vince Hunt, those
could be used to take mail from proprietary PC LANs out into an X.400
network.

    Vendors say the advantage of the gateway approach is that end users
don't have to learn anything new. They can just keep using their familiar
mail systems, except now they can send mail to people on other kinds of
mail systems.

     Many vendors, including HP and Unisys, say they have X.400 software
available under Unix, so in theory one could build an X.400 Unix-only
network. Vendor OSI groups like Osinet and Eurosinet also stage X.400
demonstrations based largely on Unix to show that their systems really can
talk to each other. Those suppliers that haven't already delivered X.400
Unix products plan to do so.

     DEC will implement X.400 as part of its DECnet Phase V release before
the end of the year; in the meantime, Ultrix users would have to route DEC
proprietary mail messages through a VMS-based X.400 router, officials
said. IBM has issued a statement of direction that it will support X.400
on its AIX Unix systems.

           Currently, X.400 provides no big advantages over RFC822 (SMTP)
and may even have some disadvantages, said Steve Kille, project manager at
University College, London, which is involved in developing and
proliferating a stack of freely available OSI software called the ISO
Development Environment. The ISODE, based on a core of software originally
developed by Marshall Rose, now with Performance Software International,
includes X.400 and X.500 software and has been incorporated into a number
of commercial products including those from the Wollongong Group and Sun
Microsystems.

     The reasons that people are getting involved are the potential future
capabilities of X.400, like multimedia and security, he said. There are
X.400 pilots on the Internet and in European countries, Kille added.

     The components of X.400 include Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) that
typically run on a local minicomputer or server and are responsible for
routing and storing mail messages to other MTAs. Communicating with those
are User Agents, the mail applications that let the user format, send and
retrieve messages from their local MTA. Today, those applications are
often replaced by gateway software that shuffles mail to and from a
proprietary mail system.

     In the future, X.400 applications and even proprietary applications
will take advantage of a key design feature of X.400: the ability to carry
much more than text messages.

     ``X.400 allows you to have enclosures that are recognized by X.400
and hold image, ASCII, the extended character sets used in European
languages, and reformattable documents [like spreadsheets or formatted
word processor documents],'' said Stephenson of Retix. ``But when you look
at the products [today], they are pretty much restricted to textual
messages at this point.''

     ``There's probably a four to five times greater demand for X.400 than
for FTAM [OSI file transfer],'' said Sun's Spencer.

     ``I think there are going to be a couple of really important
applications. One is the usage of X.400 with EDI. A lot of companies are
looking at EDI for commercial applications; they are looking at building a
retail business on EDI. I think X.400 will become the primary carrier [for
that information].''

     EDI, another OSI standard, is a protocol for carrying various kinds
of business information like purchase orders.

     Every four years, the CCITT produces a new version of the X.400
standard. The products in use today, and the services provided by public
carriers, are almost all based on the X.400 1984 standard, but 1988
compliant products are starting to emerge.

     ``'88 has some advantages, like making it easier to define new
document types, but the primary reason [for moving to it] is security,''
said Stephenson. ``'84 had essentially no security features.''

     Retix announced an '88 X.400 source code product for OEMs earlier
this year. Wollongong has an '88 product in alpha test, said Doug Ambort,
Wollongong product manager.

     Although the use of X.400 today is still relatively small, Stephenson
said that picture will change soon. ``What you'll really see happening in
the next year is that large users will start to deploy reasonable-sized
networks,'' he said. ``You'll see many large networks a year and a half
from now.'' He classified a large network as having at least 50 MTAs that
could represent several thousand end users.

     Several vendors said they don't plan to try and offer X.400 over
TCP/IP, but Sun is an exception. Spencer said, Sun can currently run FTAM
over TCP, and the company will continue that way with X.400. He declined
to give detailed product plans or delivery dates.

     The X.500 directory standard has also started to feature in vendors'
strategy and product announcements, and is being described as a technology
that, like X.400, could play a role throughout an organization. Also like
X.400, people are already talking about using it much more widely than a
directory that is used just to store mail addresses and simplify the task
of directing mail to other people.

     ``Basically if you look at existing proprietary E-mail systems, they
all have some kind of directory,'' said Stephenson. The problem is that
like the mail formats themselves, the directories are not compatible, a
problem that implementing X.500 across the board could solve.

     The X.400 '88 standard introduced a standard set of rules for
accessing X.500 directory information, to make it easier to build products
that work together. However, vendors say X.500 could have a much wider
application than just acting as a mail directory.

      ``People view X.500 as literally a telephone directory where you can
store any kind of information. For instance, there's an example where a
company is thinking of using it as an organizational chart builder,'' said
Spencer.

     Retix officials said phone companies could set up yellow pages-type
directories that could be used as the basis of a business information
service.

     When the Open Software Foundation was planning to come out with
directory and naming services as part of the Distributed Computing
Environment due later this year, OSF members ``advised us very clearly''
to make it X.500-compliant, said Jonathan Gossels, OSF business
development manager.

     OSF officials said that because you can look for objects in the
directory by searching on particular attributes, you could store printer
names and look for high-speed or color printers on the network for a
particular printing task.

    Walt Tuvell, a technical consultant at OSF, claimed that the OSF
technology adds proprietary features that remedy some of the gaps in the
current '88 X.500 standard. ``The X.500 standards do not specify
replication or caching or security,'' he said.

    ``We expect the 1992 standard will fix those [replication and security
areas],'' said Spencer, indicating that Sun would not wait till then to
introduce a product.

    According to Kille at UCL, a pilot worldwide directory system based on
X.500 has already taken off in a big way. About 400 organizations in 15
countries are participating in the pilot, he said. Some are using an X.500
implementation called Quipu that is part of the ISODE, others are using
other X.500 implementations, Kille added.

     Because OSI communications standards are meant to be independent of
OSes and programming languages and do not include any standard
applications programming interface, common APIs for X.400 and X.500 have
been slower to arrive than the software itself.

          Retix co-founded a group called the Application Programming
Interface Association that has been defining APIs for these OSI protocols,
Stephenson said. Some vendors have charged that the APIA was dominated by
Retix and that the association's X.400 API is based closely on the Retix
API. Some software, like the ISODE and Wollongong's products based on the
ISODE, does not support the APIA interface, the developers said.

     Hunt, at Touch Communications, agreed the API is based on Retix, but
said it has also been adopted by X/Open and that Touch is implementing it
in addition to its own API.

     Other vendors are using the API to build gateways or interfaces from
mail systems, Retix officials said. Among them is HP, which claims that
its OpenMail is one of the first products to include X.400 addressing and
formatting into its core architecture.

     Last year, HP and Uniplex got together to port OpenMail to non-HP
Unix platforms including DEC and IBM, and Uniplex officials said the first
ports are nearing completion.

     In the future, Stephenson said, vendors of other kinds of
applications will develop software that integrates X.400 and operates as
an X.400 user agent talking directly to an X.400 MTA.

     ``Non-E-mail vendors, spreadsheet companies, will come out with
products that attach to X.400. You would pull up a menu in a spreadsheet
package and one of the options would be mail,'' he said.

     The spreadsheet vendors will register their spreadsheet formats so
spreadsheets can be carried over X.400 and uniquely identified by the
receiver. A message can contain information from several different
applications, so when it is received, those applications can be triggered
automatically to let the receiver see the different parts of the message,
whether spreadsheet, text or image, he said.

X Server Tool For DOS PCs

    Anaheim, Calif.-Integrated Inference Machines is offering X server
software for MS-DOS PCs allowing users to save money by licensing the
software over the whole network, rather than on a per-copy basis.

    Multiuser X.11/AT 3.2 X-Window System Server software incorporates a
license manager and can be downloaded to DOS PCs from Unix or Novell
fileservers, or any platform that supports Network File System (NFS) or
DOScopy protocols.

     The license manager keeps track of the number of copies of the X
server that are in use at any given time. The user pays for a maximum of
20, 50, 100 and 250 or more ``floating users.''

    The X software runs on Microsoft Windows 3, said Charles Ross, IIM
senior VP. The software now incorporates TCP/IP drivers.

    It allows concurrent access from remote X applications and local MS
Windows applications, and cut-and-paste of text and images between X
applications and MS applications.

    IIM has tested the software to run on Novell NetWare, SCO Unix, SunOS
and Intel Unix.

    It is available immediately, priced for a 20-user license at $7,900,
plus an optional $1,000 maintenance and upgrade fee; $17,900 for a 50-user
license plus $2,500 annual maintenance; $29,500 for a 100-user license,
plus $4,000 annual maintenance; and $59,900 for a 250-user license, plus
$7,500 annual maintenance.

    On a per-user basis, that translates to $238 per user for 250 users,
and scales to $395 per user for 50 users. Most X server software packages
for DOS PCs sold on a per-copy basis sell for $450 or more.

    IIM is at 714-978-6776.

Four DECnet/SNA Links Premiere

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Maynard, Mass.-Digital Equipment has rolled out new communications
products designed to provide DECnet users with enhanced connectivity into
the world of Big Blue mainframes.

    The DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility Version 3.0 allows users on
DECnet systems to access data on IBM System Network Architecture (SNA)
computers using DECnet calls, while IBM users use SNA calls to get into
DEC Ultrix, VMS and RSX machines, as well as MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, said
Jane Brewer, DEC's IBM interconnect marketing manager.

    ``It's a file-transfer and information-access environment,'' said
Brewer. ``It connects to the two environments and lets users in each
environment initiate file transfers using the commands that they're used
to.''

    The facility is ideal for situations where systems administrators need
to put longstanding VMS or Ultrix operations in touch with each other.

    ``Our users tend to be comfortable working with what they're used to,
which is SNA-oriented,'' said Brewer. ``They tend to be large corporate
data centers which have large investments in SNA. Manufacturing and
scientific arms of those organizations have VMS and Ultrix. Now people are
saying, `Let's integrate it. We don't want to have multiple copies of
everything.' ''

    The products, which are expected to be available next month, come in
four components:

        DTF Server is the software package that controls all requests for
information and includes fail-safe functionality. It runs on a VMS
platform, starting at $1,510 for the VAXstation, increasing in price to
$22,100 for the VAX 6410 and reaching $63,200 for the VAX 9000 mainframe.

    DEC Utilities includes remote management features and other fail-safe
functionality. It is priced at $640 for a low-end VAXstation, $9,480 on
the VAX 6410 and $27,000 for the mainframe VAX 9000.

    The DTF software module that runs on the MVS machine is priced at
$30,900, and the software module running on the VMS machine is priced at
$21,000.

    DEC also offers two 2.2-Mbps pay-one-price packages featuring server,
IBM software and the DECnet/SNA Gateway CT, which actually passes data
from the DECnet to SNA environments. The packages are priced at $60,000
for MVS systems and $50,000 for VM systems, independent of which VMS
platform they run on.

    Digital has also introduced a new terminal server and router.

    The DECserver 300 Version 2 terminal server, supporting 16 ports,
allows users to run Local Area Transport (LAT) and telnet sessions
simultaneously, said Lee Cooper, network marketing manager.

    The server software can be downloaded from a PC running MS-DOS and
DEC's PC networking software, Pathworks 3. Until now, software was
downloadable only from a VAX. ``Now you have a low-cost alternative to
give the department local control over the terminal server,'' said Cooper.

    Ultrix pricing for the standalone software is $616, while VMS pricing
is set at $647. The software will also be bundled with future sales of the
DECserver 300, the company said. Pricing for the DOS-downloadable version
is $650.

    The DECrouter 150 supports two serial ports as well as an IEEE
802.3/Ethernet port. The serial lines can either be one at 56 or 64 Kbps
and one at 9.6 Kbps, or two lines at 19.2 Kbps. The product also supports
modem dial-back as a security feature.

    The router is available immediately and is priced at $3,250.

    For more information, Digital can be reached at 508-493-5111.

New Sniffer Net Monitor Debuts

    Billerica, Mass.-Network General is offering a new version of its
Sniffer network-monitoring product that does what the Sniffer's never done
before-stay in one place.

    The Sniffer was, until recently, a network-monitoring product designed
to be taken from place to place on the network, with a tap to cut in on
network wiring and interpretive software that runs on a laptop computer to
dissect the network traffic moving over the wire.

    Now, Network General is offering the Distributed Sniffer, which offers
similar functionality in a unit the size of a PC CPU, designed to be
scattered in groups over network segments and feed data to software that
analyzes and displays it on a PC-the SniffMaster Console, said Network
General.

    ``The basic product, the analyzer, allows you to see into your
network-it's like a CAT scan for your LAN,'' said company spokesman Ron
Herman.

    The Sniffer approach to monitoring the network is different from one
that has become more popular over the past two years, since the emergence
of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) element of TCP/IP.

    In the SNMP school, network devices are polled for their status by
management software-a process with the picturesque name of pinging-and the
devices send signals back to the manager.

    Sniffers actually tap into the network traffic, sampling it and
determining the state of the network that way.

    ``I don't necessarily think it's a conflict with SNMP,'' said Bob
Bessin, manager of market development for Network General. ``SNMP was
developed to check the status of the devices on the network. SNMP is
limiting. What we do is decode traffic on the network, provide statistics
on network traffic itself.''

    But he added that Sniffers can report to SNMP software.

    The system consists of Sniffer Servers, which actually tap into the
network and collect data. Applications running on the servers are the
Analysis Application, providing troubleshooting, performance analysis and
network optimization by capturing and analyzing packets on more than 120
protocols. The Monitoring Application tracks network traffic, keeping
network and station statistics, issuing alarms and trying to proactively
identify problems. It generates standard or customized reports.

    The Distributed Sniffer will be available in June. Server pricing is
$4,995 to $10,995, depending on applications and configuration. The
console, which consists of a board and software, is priced at $7,995. Two
starter kits are available: a kit of two Ethernet servers with monitoring
and analysis applications and a console board and software for $19,995,
and a 16/4-Mbps Token Ring starter kit for $21,995.


    Network General can be reached at 415-688-2700.

High-Speed LU6.2 Link Intro'd

    Lebanon, N.H.-Corporate Microsystems is introducing software to
provide for LU6.2 file transfer and remote execution across Unix, IBM
proprietary and OS/2 platforms.

    MLINK APPC Communications System (MACS) is ``an outgrowth of a need
among our customers to instigate a high-speed link along OSI,'' said Dick
Green, president of CMI.

    For executing jobs in the IBM environment, LU6.2 is much faster than
the more common form of IBM System Network Architecture (SNA)
connectivity, where the client machine emulates an IBM 3270 terminal,
Green said.

    Meanwhile, for job execution on Unix, CMI intentionally stayed away
from the most common networking protocol, TCP/IP. Instead, CMI decided to
have the remote, non-Unix node on the network initiate Unix commands by
spawning a Bourne or C shell and generating commands either in ASCII or
the IBM equivalent to ASCII, EBCDIC. The shell is spawned using Virtual
Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM), a component of SNA.

    ``The reason for not using TCP/IP is that it's not a default in most
mainframe shops,'' Green said. ``VTAM is an integral part of the operating
system in 90 percent of the mainframe shops. TCP/IP will be found more
often in the future, and we will eventually support that.''

    MACS is now available for IBM mainframes running MVS or DOS/VSE. It
requires VTAM Release 3.2 or higher. The product is also now available for
the RS/6000 and the RT running AIX, and for systems running OS/2. It is
expected to be available for the AS/400 by June 1, and also for several
Unix platforms, including the NCR 3000, Bull DPX/2 and AT&T's Intel-based
platforms. It may be used over any SNA-supported link, including Token
Ring, SDLC, X.25 and Ethernet.

    Green said that CMI focused on file transfer and remote execution in a
strategy designed to achieve maximum performance for those two functions.
MACS intentionally offers far less functionality than a product like XCom,
from Spectrum Concepts in New York, which offers a full Unix-to-SNA API.

    CMI does not offer direct DOS or Macintosh connectivity, but signals
can be passed to the Mac or PC through the Unix machine, Green said.

    The mainframe pricing for the product is $11,500 to $29,500. The
RS/6000 version is priced from $2,495 to $6,500. MACS for OS/2 is priced
at $1,250.

    CMI can be reached at 617-259-1400.

NASA's TAE Eases Interface Design

By  DENIS HART



    Greenbelt, Md.-The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
technology distribution arm will soon make available to commercial users
its latest release of a software application environment called TAE Plus.

    TAE Plus Version 5.0, based on the OSF/Motif toolkit and X11R4, allows
users to interactively design end-user interfaces.

    TAE Plus, first developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center with
support from Century Computing and RMS Technologies, generates C or Ada
code automatically after a user interface is designed. The code connects
the user interface with lower-level computer services such as databases,
said Elfrida Harris, manager of TAE support at NASA.

    The main components of TAE include a WorkBench, a set of Window
Programming Tools and the TAE Command Language. The WorkBench allows users
to construct and manipulate a set of ``interaction objects.'' These
include user-entry objects, such as radio buttons and text entry fields;
information objects, such as brief status error messages displayed in a
bother box; and data-driven boxes such as dials, thermometers and strip
charts.

    The system's Window Programming Tools are services used by application
programs to display and control the WorkBench-designed user interface
objects. Unlike other commercial products, the WPTs allow users to create
a user interface that remains independent of the application code,
allowing changes  to be made to the interface without changing application
code, Harris said.

    ``I think most graphics tools use code to build the interface, and
that code becomes part of your application,'' she said. TAE's set of
windowing tools have also been submitted to the POSIX 1201.1 committee for
consideration in an upcoming layered application programming interface
standard.

    Pat Mortenson, director of marketing at Cosmic, NASA's commercial
distribution contractor, estimated that the latest version of the software
should be ready within two to four weeks. The new software, unlike the
previous 4.1 version, will run on Motif 1.1 and X11R4.

    The product has already been ported to the DECstation 3100 and DEC
VAXstations running Ultrix, Sun SPARCstations and the HP 9000 Series 3000
running Unix. It will also be ported to Macintosh II and Apollo
workstations as soon as they upgrade to Motif 1.1, Harris said.

   Users who want to do a complete installation from source code must have
X11R4, Motif 1.1 and a C and a C++ compiler, NASA said. The software
includes InterViews and idraw, two software packages developed by Stanford
University and integrated into the product.

    So far, Version 4.1 of the software has been installed in more than
400 user sites, a third of which are commercial users and the rest
academic institutions and government sites, Harris said. She added that,
unlike other graphical user interfaces, the software is geared more toward
non-programmers and has, therefore, proven popular.

    Mortenson agreed. She added that compared to existing commercial
products, TAE is also inexpensive. Although prices for the new product
haven't yet been decided on, licenses for Version 4.1 of the programming
system cost only $500. ``A person who develops a commercial product on TAE
is also free to distribute that product without restriction,'' Mortenson
said. She added that academic institutions are also eligible for a 50
percent discount.

    ``Since the products have been created with taxpayer money, NASA is
not expected to recover development costs,'' Mortenson said.

    Harris added, however, that the commercial acceptance of the new
product will be directly related to how widespread the use of Motif 1.1
becomes in the future.

    Most customers of TAE have been those who have been computer-literate,
such as universities, high-technology companies and some consulting firms.
So far, however, even though X-Window systems and Unix have prospered in
the financial community, few such firms and companies have sought out NASA
technology for their systems. Cosmic is at 404-542-3265.

OSF Patches Motif 1.0

    Cambridge, Mass.-The Open Software Foundation has made available a
patch release to Motif Version 1.0 for those users who have not yet
migrated to X11R4.

    The product, patch release 1.0.5, contains changes necessary to fix
approximately 40 bugs, but offers no new functionality, said OSF systems
engineer David Brooks.

    The corrections include changes to the X11R3 intrinsics that will
prevent the major memory leaks that occur when users delete dialog widgets
and corrections that previously caused compiling difficulties on various
architectures, Brooks said.

    The patch also corrects a warning message caused from setting scroll
bar thickness at more than two pixels and display errors caused when users
use horizontal scrolling with tabbed characters in text. The patch also
reworks some code that caused an incorrect x-pointer icon size on
DECstations running Ultrix.

     Brooks said this will be the last patch released for Motif 1.0 and
added that though there may be some outstanding problems, ``none of them
are fatal.''

   Although OSF will still accept questions on usage and code problems for
its previous Motif release, OSF will not fix code problems for Motif 1.0
from now on.

    Brooks also said that all the fixes made to Motif 1.0 have already
been made to Motif 1.1.

    Motif 1.0.5 is available at no charge to Motif 1.0 licensees who hold
full support or update contracts for Motif. Also, those users who have
already received 1.0.4 will receive the new patch automatically.

   Contact the Motif Support Administration, Open Software Foundation,
617-621-7300, or via E-mail at motif-support-admin@osf.org.

DATA MANAGEMENT

    By Julie Anderson



    At the recent UNIX Today!DCI Open Systems Forum in Atlanta, we spent

half of the first day tossing about various definitions for the term
``open system.'' After hearing several speakers' thoughts on the subject,
we generally agreed that for a system to be ``open,'' it must provide a
defined set of standard interfaces.


     The obvious advantage of open systems to end users is vendor
independence. Vendors may not consider this an advantage as they watch
their margins dwindle, but end users become free to base their
applications on a mix of products from many vendors.


     Unfortunately, we are just starting to see the first open systems. So
far, much interface-definition work has focused on standardizing low-level
operating system interfaces--system and library calls. This is fine if
you're using C.

    But what about the sizable number of people who are building DBMS
applications? True, many are writing C code and using SQL for data
definition and manipulation. These people are faring relatively well
because of the ANSI efforts to standardize SQL (a slow and painful
process). Useful standards are also promised from the SQL Access Group.

     Many people, however, are using the DBMS vendor's 4GL or front-end
tools to build at least part, if not all, of the application. Yet, there
are no standard interfaces for the end user for these tools, nor am I
aware of any standards movements afoot. Any similarities that you may find
among the many 4GLs on the market are merely coincidental. Oracle, for
example, doesn't even have a 4GL; it has an interactive forms builder,
SQLoForms, that generates a screen definition which is driven by the
Oracle runforms utility.

     A few products do provide vendor independence at the database level.
Unify and Jyacc offer tools (Accell and Jam) that build data entry forms
that can be used with a variety of databases. But a Jam screen is not
interchangeable with an Accell form, and vice versa.

     At one of the Forum sessions, the MIS directors from Hyatt Hotels and
the Burlington Coat Factory presented their strategies and experiences
with building OLTP applications on Unix. Both had chosen Informix as their
database and used Informix/4GL as their development language. They were
impressed by the high productivity that Informix/4GL gave them. In
addition, they were able to hire less technical (i.e., cheaper) people to
do the development. (Not good news for CICS experts, I must say.)

     By choosing Informix, Hyatt and Burlington Coat Factory were able to
get vendor independence. Because Informix runs on a wide variety of
systems, the underlying hardware and operating system could be changed
without having to modify the application.

     But as an astute attendee pointed out, these systems are only
quasi-open. They are vendor-independent at the hardware and
operating-system levels, but tied tightly to the Informix vendor at the
API level. Changing to a different DBMS means a rewrite of the
application.

     What are application developers to do to get high productivity and an
open system too? Unite. Vendors have little incentive to standardize their
APIs unless users insist. To survive, vendors must deliver what the
customer demands.

Motif GUIs For Ada

By DAN RICHMAN



    San Diego-Ada programmers working on Data General's AViiON, SPARC and
Sun-3 systems can automatically create Motif-based graphical user
interfaces by using new techniques with products already sold by Telesoft,
according to Bruce Sherman, the company's vice president of corporate
marketing.

    Telesoft has released an 18-page ``technical application note''
describing how to use two of its interface-generation products, TeleGen2
Ada and TeleUSE, with Ada. Until now, those products could be used only
with C.

    TeleUSE lets programmers ``paint'' static screens and describe with
if-then statements how the interface should function. Then they
automatically generate Ada (or C) code to produce those results. TeleGen2
Ada includes a compiler, a debugger, an optimizer, a profiler and
productivity tools. The two products can be used separately for other
purposes, but must be used together to generate Motif-based GUI interfaces
for Ada.

    Automatic interface-generators can save up to 90 percent of the time
that writing such code from scratch would consume, Sherman said.

    The technical application note is free with the licensing of the two
products, or on request to current users. TeleUSE is priced at costs
$7,500; TeleGen2 Ada costs from $4,500 to $9,500 depending on the
platform. Telesoft can be contacted at 619-457-2700.

Ada Bindings For V.I. Tools from richman

    Northampton, Mass.-V.I. Corp. has announced bindings that are said to
make it easier for Ada developers to use its DataViews application
development tools. The bindings (C language header files that allow one
language to be called from another) sell for $3,000 and are available
immediately.

    DataViews is a package of tools for creating dynamic GUIs. Dynamic
GUIs can display not only icons that launch programs but symbols that
change to represent data. For example, in a direct manipulation interface
typical of those produced by DataViews, opening a GUI ``valve'' can
instruct the program to drain the tank, and the liquid level in the GUI
``tank'' will steadily decrease as it drains, said Andrew Copeland, V.I.'s
vice president of marketing and operations.

    The bindings must be used with DataViews' DV-Tools, which sells for
$17,700. That price includes DV-Draw, a drawing editor, but not DV-Proto,
a prototyping tool.

    The company can be reached at 413-586-4144.

Acer Intros i486-Based Machines -- Touts Workstations And Servers'
Performance, Expandability, Graphics Processing

    San Jose-Acer America recently rolled out two new workstations and two
servers, all powered by Intel's new i486 SX processor.

    Units, priced in monitorless base configurations from $2,745 to
$11,995, can run either SCO or Interactive Unix or MS-DOS. The two Unix
operating systems can be purchased separately at a cost of about $700 for
SCO Unix and $600 for Interactive. The systems also will run Banyan Vines
and Novell NetWare.

     Desktop units are called the AcerPower 486SX and the AcerPower 500.
Floor-standing servers are the AcerFrame 1000 and the AcerFrame 3000SP33.

    Acer director of product marketing Olend King said the machines are
distinguished from other PCs by their performance, expandability and
graphics processing. Both workstations support Ultra-VGA graphics.

    All units use a 20-MHz, 14-MIPS 486SX processor except for the
3000SP33, which uses a 33-MHz, 20-MIPS 486SX. Upgrades to a 33- and
eventually a 50-MHz 486SX can be made by inserting a new chip into the
motherboard through Acer's ChipUp upgrade technology or through modular
upgrades.

    Acer said it has designed the 486SX for use in graphical windowing
environments. The system's $2,745 base configuration includes 2 Mbytes of
memory and can support as much as 98 Mbytes of RAM. The unit's memory
implementation supports as many as 63 different SIMM conbinations,
allowing incremental upgrades without RAM swapouts, Acer said.

    Available immediately, the workstation also features 8k bytes of
internal processor cache, Ultra-VGA graphics supporting 1,024-by-768-pixel
resolution, four ISA slots and a 1.44-Mbyte, 3.5-inch floppy disk drive.

    The Power500 is a six-slot EISA-based modular system for engineering,
financial and entry-level networking and multiuser Unix environments.

    Featuring 4 to 256 Mbytes of memory, the $3,745 base unit uses a
128-bit data path that supports dynamic expansion from 32-, 64- and
128-bit accesses as memory is expanded. The system also supports Ultra-VGA
graphics resolution.

    Acer's AcerFrame 1000 is an EISA-based, floor-standing server designed
for networked and multiuser Unix work groups. The unit holds 4 to 128
Mbytes of RAM and eight EISA expansion slots. A 5.25-floppy disk drive is
included. Availability is expected in June.

    The AcerFrame 1000, which supports at least 32 users, has a suggested
base price of $4,995 and will be available in June, Acer said.

    The AcerFrame 3000SP33, priced at approximately $11,995 and available
this month, was designed for client/server environments and applications
such as business databases. It supports eight to 64 users and supports
Novell NetWare, Banyan Vines and OS/2 LAN Manager.

    The unit features 8 to 64 Mbytes of RAM, a 5.25-inch floppy disk
drive, secondary-level processor cache, eight EISA expansion slots,
built-in VGA and an LCD console. An EISA SCSI disk controller is
available. The unit supports as much as 2 gigabytes of internal on-line
storage using SCSI hard disk drives.

    Monitors available from Acer include the AcerView 35, a
1,024-by-768-pixel color monitor priced at $995; the AcerView 33, an
800-by-600 color monitor costing $795; and a black-and-white monitor
priced at $200. The units are equipped with Windows 3.0 but will support
windowing environments from SCO and Interactive, King said.

    While the new systems continue Acer's reliance on Intel, Acer is
investigating whether to build a Mips-based RISC system in accordance with
the Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) specification, said King.

    ``We're evaluating the marketplace as the year goes on,'' he said.

    Acer last month became part of a 22-member ACE initiative. The
companies plan to build or distribute systems that would run the SCO Open
Desktop and Microsoft OS/2 3.0 operating environments on systems based on
Intel and Mips R3000 and R4000 processors.

    Acer can be contacted at 408-922-0333.

Imaging Unit Unveiled

By  LEE BRUNO



    Dayton, Ohio-NCR has unveiled a general-purpose imaging system aimed
at making image-based document processing affordable to users who want to
combine such image-processing tasks as scanning, optical storage,
character recognition and relational database services into a single
system.

    The client/server-based product, called the Document Management System
(DMS), runs on NCR's System 3000 line of Unix-based servers and
workstations over either a Token Ring or Ethernet connection and supports
SNA 3270 communications protocols. Included with the system is an optical
disk jukebox that provides the large storage capacity required for image
records.

    One of the key components in the DMS product is called Workflow
Automation. This software element is icon-driven and allows the user to
see where a particular document is at any time. This capability allows an
organization to graphically represent and track the flow of documents
being processed within an office or an enterprisewide networked
environment.

    Another component of the system is its character-recognition
capability. This technology utilizes neural network principles, which
allows the system to adapt and learn the important inputs in a particular
environment. NCR said this technology involves three algorithms, of which
one is a neural network-based algorithm. NCR said the technology enables
the system to read typewritten fonts as well as hand-printed numbers.


    The size of typical image records that the DMS can handle is roughly
50k bytes, while conventional application data records only run from 100
to 1,000 bytes, NCR said. To handle these larger files, NCR said it added
Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) in both central processing unit and
memory and in their I/O subsystems.

    NCR said the product will be featured with the System 3000 line of
workstations. The system ranges in price from $800,000 for a
20-workstation configuration to $3.5 million for a 120-workstation system.

    NCR said the DMS will be delivered in the first quarter of 1991. For
additional information, call 513-445-5000.

Graphics Performance Gets A Boost

    Austin, Texas-National Design has rolled out three new Unix-based
graphics coprocessor boards based on Texas Instruments' TMS34020 chip for
PCs that boost graphics performance and allow a user to modify the board
characteristics to meet high-resolution requirements.

    The three boards plug into the AT bus of PCs or compatibles and are
called the AT1100, AT1300 and AT1600. They are designed to boost the
graphics performance of a PC, allowing a user to run graphics routines at
175,000 independent vectors per second in a Unix environment and 65,000
Xstones in an X-Window environment. The board runs under both SCO Open
Desktop 1.1 and Interactive Unix 2.2. National said the TI TMS34020
graphics processor is a particularly fast ``fill engine'' that allows a
user to draw and shade graphic images quickly.

    National said the products can be modified to meet user requirements,
such as higher resolution and color diversity for particular graphics
applications. For example, the AT1100 is capable of delivering 24-bit
color in 1,024-by-768 resolution with 16.7 million colors. If a user wants
a greater resolution, such as 1,280-by-1,024, then the AT1300 snap-in
module can be added to the AT1100 base board and get 16-bit color. Those
demanding a 1,600-by-1,280 resolution display would add the AT1600 module
to the base board and get 8-bit color with 256 colors.

    Gabrielle Ryan, president of National Design, said the boards are
targeted at the process-control market in manufacturing and the electronic
engineering market. Typically, these two markets utilize PCs along with
Unix-based servers, and the boards allow PCs running Unix to interoperate
with VME-based Unix systems, Ryan said. For example, a person using a
PC-based Unix workstation can design a part and then send that data file
to the VME-based shop floor for production, Ryan added.

    Ryan said that all of the server component-utilized in an X-Window
environment-fits on the graphics coprocessor board, and only a few
low-level CPU routines are executed on the main CPU of the host. In
addition, the base board also contains all of the DRAM and video RAM.

    National said it also provides a 3-D snap-in module for the boards
that utilizes TI's TMS34082 floating-point coprocessor chip. This option
allows the user to execute up to 40 million floating-point operations per
second, Ryan said.

    National said the three boards will ship this June. The AT1100 costs
$2,995, while the AT1300 and AT1600 costs $3,995.

    For additional information, call 512-343-5055.

Integrated SPARC Chipset Bows

    Sunnyvale-Weitek today plans to announce an integrated SPARC chipset
that could enable SPARC-compatible makers to build SPARCstation 2-class
systems selling for $10,000 by summer.

    Weitek's SPARC Enhancement set includes the W8701 SPARC
microprocessor, which integrates the floating-point and integer units onto
a single chip, and the W8720 Integrated Graphics Controller (IGC), a
single-chip graphics acceleration unit. The W8720 is a single-slot Sbus
card that allows for migration of accelerated 2-D graphics to the
motherboard of next-generation SPARC workstations, Weitek said.

    ``What we're doing is providing the systems manufacturers an
opportunity to come up on the power curve,'' said Christopher Tice,
general manager of Weitek's processor business group.

    By combining the floating-point and integer units on one chip, the
W8701 cuts system processor cost, Weitek said. The 207-pin unit delivers
28.5 MIPS and 21 SPECmarks when used at 40 MHz and roughly 23.5 MIPS and
17 SPECmarks at 33 MHz, Tice said.

    The 40-MHz ratings compare with Sun's SPARCstation 2, which has a base
price of $15,000. Through the SPARC Enhancement set, SPARC-compatible, or
clone, builders could build 28.5-MIPS systems in the $10,000 range
depending on their own design expertise, said Tice. The chipset is
expected to be available in May and begin appearing in systems this
summer.

    Tice said several SPARC-compatible makers are interested in the
chipset, but he would not name them. Weitek, which has provided
floating-point units for existing SPARC chipsets, said the W8701 is a
single-unit replacement for Cypress Semiconductor's multichip 601/CY7C602
SPARC RISC chipset.

    ``This is one of the first, if not the first, design for a SPARC
microprocessor that was done outside of Sun,'' Tice said.

    Weitek is pricing the chip in quantities of 5,000 at $240 for the
33-MHz device and $264 for the 40-MHz version.

    The 208-pin W8720 features internal memory and video control
functionality and hardwires such graphics functions as polygon drawing,
BitBLT( BitBlock Line Transfer) and logical raster operations. It is rated
at 400,000 2-D vectors per second and 100 million pixels per second. The
unit runs in the frame-buffer bandwidth, Tice said.

    The chip can be used in windowed graphics environments such as
X-Window, Microsoft Windows, SunView or Display PostScript, Weitek said.

    The chipset marks Weitek's entry into the SPARC microprocessor market,
although the company has been supplying floating-point units for SPARC

OLTP Box From NEC

By DAN RICHMAN



    Tokyo-Targeting the telecommunications industry, NEC said it plans to
start shipping its first fault-tolerant on-line transaction processing
computer, the Super Tolerant FT20, in late November.

    The machine's manufacturer, Stratus Computer, calls it the first
commercially available RISC-based fault-tolerant computer to run SVR4.
Stratus, which announced the machine last month, sells it as the XA/R
Model 20.

    The machine runs at 40 MIPS with 32-MHz i860 RISC chips. NEC will sell
it for 78 million yen (about $591,000 at current exchange rates) equipped
with 32 Mbytes of memory in each of its two processors, duplexed I/O and
other essentials, a tape drive, and LAN and OS software. Stratus sells it
for $274,000 with essentially the same configuration.

    NEC spokesman Yoshiko Senft (CQ) said the price difference results in
part from features NEC adds, like Japanese-language processing and
printing and enhanced connectivity with NEC's other computers and
software.

    NEC will market the Super Tolerant FT20 both alone and in conjunction
with its NEAX 61 central office switching equipment. Targeted customers
include national and regional phone companies, providers of 800- and
900-number services, credit-card verification services, and private phone
networks.

    Both NEC and Stratus stressed that fault tolerance is becoming
increasingly important in telecommunications as more and more data travel
over phone lines. Stratus regards telecommunications as ``a key
opportunity for growth,'' said Dave Hayward, a Stratus spokesman.

    For more information, NEC can be reached at 508-264-8000.

CROSSINGS

Perhaps the most well-known Unix transaction processing (TP)
monitor is Tuxedo, from AT&T's spinoff, Unix System Laboratories (USL).
That may be because Tuxedo is probably the oldest Unix TP monitor around;
it has been used inside AT&T Bell Laboratories and other AT&T units since
1982, and its roots go back to even earlier development projects. Tuxedo
has been available for license since 1985.

    Tuxedo supports a distributed on-line transaction processing (OLTP)
environment, supporting client/server networks. In keeping with the
``open'' philosophy, Tuxedo remains independent of any particular RDBMS,
network protocol, hardware platform or Unix version.

    Mark Curges, one of Tuxedo's principal architects and a member of
USL's technical team, refers to Tuxedo as ``the glue'' that can hold
together a heterogeneous network of different versions of Unix running on
different hardware platforms-a 386, a Mips RISC CPU, you name it.

    The Tuxedo System consists of two major components, System /T and
System /D. The first, /T, is a transaction-processing (TP) monitor. It is
the real glue that binds multiple systems, including desktop computers,
workstations and servers, together across a network.

    The System /T TP monitor oversees and controls transactions across the
network. It consists of libraries for making systems calls to the Unix
operating system and relational and hierarchical databases, as well as
commands.T is database-independent and includes interfaces to all leading
Unix relational database management systems (RDBMSes), including Oracle,
Informix, Ingres, Sybase and others. It conforms to X/Open's XA TP
interface.

    The second component is System /D, a combined hierarchical and
relational DBMS. It was also developed and used internally for TP
applications within AT&T and the old Bell System. System /T and /D are
licensed separately, with more licensees opting for /T than /D. That makes
sense, as many of the licensees are leading Unix RDBMS vendors, who
obviously do not need T&T&APOTROPH;s DBMS

    Tuedo, which USL licenses to any interested party, runs on Unix System
V Release 4 operating system, supporting OLTP applications in a
client/&TC;server environment. Network protocol support includes TCP/IP,
the current standard in the Unix market, as well as the Open Systems
Interconnect (OSI) suite, IBM's NetBIOS and Novell's NetWare.

    Curges notes that though open OLTP systems offer many advantages over
traditional proprietary ones, customers simply will not throw away their
existing investments, especially in applications that for many companies
deliver revenue-generating services to customers. For that reason,
interfacing open OLTP systems to existing proprietary OLTP systems is a
hot item, he says. In response, USL is developing a third component,
called /Host, that will connect the /T TP monitor to an IBM Customer
Information Control System (CICS) TP environment through IBM SNA 3270 and
LU 6.2 protocols. This product was demonstrated in the USL booth at the
UniForum show last January in Dallas.

Interactive Readies Its System V.4 OS

By  DENIS HART



    Santa Monica, Calif.-Interactive has set June 2, the date of a
developers' conference for its Unix System V product line, for the
introduction of its Unix System V.4 operating system and development
environment.

    Interactive CEO Dennis Peck said that the product will be based on
Unix System Laboratories' base V.4 version, but said that Interactive will
also supply Motif with the product.

    Interactive expects, however, to begin shipping enhancements to the
product sometime in the last quarter of this year. ``This will be our
initial product. We will have a second release in the fourth quarter of
this year, and we are planning a major release in the first half of
1992,'' Peck said.

    The product, which will operate on 386 and 486 systems, will be
targeted toward ISVs, sophisticated end users and the value-added reseller
community, he added.

     Paul Wellens, product line manager for V.4 at Interactive, said that
the product will be the first V.4 on the market to follow USL's published
model and, unlike the competition, Interactive will not modify the base
product.

    He added that unlike such products as Microport's and UHC's V.4
implementations, Interactive's release will be based on V.4 Version 3, the
latest of USL's source code releases. Version 3 offers reliability
enhancements and a new installation program that make it easier for V.4 to
be installed on Intel-based systems. The base system will include the Open
Look GUI, X11R4 and full documentation, Peck said.

    Interactive also expects to add additional enhancements to the product
by the end of 1991. Most notably, ``what you can expect to see in our
fourth quarter release is iBCS2 compatibility, our version of Portable
NetWare for V.4 and a V.4-oriented DOS simulator,'' Peck said. IBSC2
compatibility will allow applications to be portable over SCO Unix and
Interactive Unix environments.

    The next release of Interactive V.4 should also include USL's
multiprocessing extensions, Interactive said.

    Peck said he expects more than 500 people to attend the developers'
conference. The conference will feature 84 speakers, 50 technical sessions
and product demonstrations by approximately 30 vendors. Kodak will also be
showcasing a photo finisher workstation running V.4.

Upgraded HP/UX Debuts

    Palo Alto-Hewlett-Packard has brought out a new release of the HP/UX
operating system, tailored specifically for its new low-end HP Apollo 9000
Series 7000 workstations, but also compatible with the Series 300 and 400
workstations and Series 800 business servers.

    The new HP/UX 8.0 includes enhancements such as Instant Ignition, a
pre-loaded and preconfigured system that includes the X-Window System,
OSF/Motif, HP Visual User Environment 2.01, and System Administration
Manager, a menu-driven system-administration utility.

    ``What Instant Ignition basically is, is all the most popular things a
customer would buy preinstalled on a disk such that the customer plugs the
system in and up it comes. It includes the operating system, X-Windows and
Motif,'' said Chris Van Woerken, HP/UX product manager. ``Literally, it's
a matter of plugging in your machine and hitting the power switch,'' he
said.

    The operating system conforms to SVID2, XPG3, POSIX 1003.1, FIPS 151-1
and Network Computing System and NFS communication protocols.

    Although Van Woerken claims the system is based on V.3, HP/UX 8.0 does
not have Streams, the networking protocol included in AT&T's Unix System
V.3. ``We are starting to get some input for Streams and are starting to
consider it in our future plans,'' he said. He added that although the
current product has a full set of ``Berkeley-isms, there aren't as many as
all of our customers would like. We are remedying that on an ongoing
basis.'' He said that Berkeley MAP libraries are something that HP will
add in future releases of the product.

    HP will also make the full set of OSI protocols available to users as
a separate package, and will make the full set of operating system
documentation for the new operating system available on a CD-ROM format
for $695.

    In line with the company's hopes of making its systems easier to use
for the end user, Hewlett-Packard's new System Administration Manager also
helps system administrators with such tasks as adding users, configuring
the system with diskless clusters and setting up different system backup
mechanisms.

    ``We spent a lot of time to make life easier for the user and have
added all the latest standards that exist in this point in time,'' Van
Woerken said.

    HP also plans to run native OSF/1 on the system 7000 line by the end
of the year and plans to make OSF/1 and HP/UX 8.0 application-compatible
in that time frame.

    The new product also has additional tools, including HP Switch
Over/UX, a feature that switches jobs to a standby processor when there is
a system failure, and a version of the Korn shell that allows users to
navigate HP/UX systems interactively.

    Hewlett-Packard is at 303-229-2255.

Tracking Adverse Drug Reactions

By  LEE BRUNO



    Stamford, Conn.-Clinical Information Services has unveiled a
Unix-based information system for pharmaceutical companies that can manage
data about adverse reactions to drugs and produce reports required by
health authorities.

    The product, called the Adverse-Reaction Information System (ARIS),
runs on Apollo and Sun workstations and provides users with a tool for
validating and analyzing data about adverse drug reactions. The data
collected can then be used to produce reports in different languages for
worldwide health authorities such as the World Health Organization and
regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, CIS
officials said.

    CIS said pharmaceutical companies are required to submit data on
adverse reactions to drugs to governmental regulatory bodies that oversee
drug safety. Typically, the company said, these reports have to be
submitted within a few days of any new reports of an adverse reaction.

    CIS said some of the types of reports ARIS can produce include forms
that can be submitted to regulatory bodies such as France's Commission
Nationale De Pharmacovigilance, the Italian Ministry of Health and
England's Committee on the Safety of Medicines.

        CIS said the system is capable of providing the necessary
information for a Drug Experience Report, used for recording drugs' side
effects and adverse reactions. The product is able to extract the
necessary data from the report and import it into a letter for regulatory
agencies.

    One of the key advantages of the system is that a small or large
pharmaceutical company can use the product to track all adverse drug
reactions worldwide, CIS said.

    Arthur Allen, sales manager at CIS, said ARIS can also be used as a
tool for archiving information about drugs and adverse reactions. The ARIS
system operates in a distributed environment so that drug information from
both clinical studies and post-marketing studies can be pooled for
evaluation, CIS officials said.

    The ARIS system supports data entry with defined code lists that
pinpoint the country where an adverse reaction was reported. In addition,
a user can access various types of data groups, such as patient and
disease data, through a menu option window. Also, the system has a set of
standard dictionaries in multiple languages for diseases, drugs and
adverse reactions. These dictionaries and languages can be selected during
data entry and report generation.

    The system is able to link multiple processors and printers at remote
sites over communication networks including Ethernet, wide-area networks
and leased lines, CIS officials said. The system is based on Oracle's
database and allows a user to customize the data structure and screen
formats.

    The ARIS system runs on Unix-based Apollo and Sun workstations and is
written in the C programming language. A basic configuration of the system
running on a Sun workstation costs $68,000 and includes phone support and
training. The basic license allows the user to run as many terminals off
the main workstation as desired. However, each additional remote node
connected to the main workstation by a communication link costs $16,000.

    For more information, call CIS at 203-964-8317.

3-D Tool Blends Voxels, Geometry

By LEE BRUNO



    Fairfield, Iowa-Vital Images has unveiled a Unix-based interactive
volume-rendering software system that allows engineers and scientists to
embed traditional geometricgraphics such as lines into a volume of 3-D
data.


    The company said the new product, called VoxelView/Ultra, increases
the rendering speed and efficiency and allows a user to comine both
voxels-a three-dimensional pixel&HYPHand geometry into one image. In the
past, a user would have to choose between these two visualization methods.

    The product runs on Silicon Graphics' IRIS Powervision family of
workstations.

    Vital Images said it developed the product because its customers have
been asking for a way of melding geometric graphics and volume rendering
without giving up the inherent benefits of each method. For example, an
engineer evaluating oil and gas fields can combine seismic data and data
gathered from the well into the same image to help determine where the
likely regions of oil deposits may reside.

    Bill Van Zandt, director of research and development at Vital Images,
said VoxelView/Ultra will provide both scientists and engineers with a new
tool for visualizing data.

    ``It will be a way of summarizing data and helping to quantify further
by enabling scientists and engineers to make concrete measurements,'' Van
Zandt said, referring to the VoxelView/Ultra product. ``Now, in a few
seconds they can see an entire rendered volume that they could have taken
months to look at in 2-D slides and paper,'' he said.

    Vital Images said the previous version of VoxelView Plus rendered 4
million voxels per second on a four-CPU SGI GTX workstation. The new
product, running on a single CPU IRIS/4D-310 VGX workstation, can
volume-render data at a rate of 18 million voxels per second. The product
is also capable of volume-rendering photo-realistic images with shading,
variable transparency and anti-aliasing at about 10 million voxels per
second.

    One of the areas in which the company said it expects the product to
be used is in planning radiation treatment, in which a doctor can use the
volume data to help target the radiation beams at tumors. Doctors may also
use the system for checking that a bone implant will fit the body socket
it was designed for.

    Simultaneously, the company also debuted its development environment
software, called VoxelView 2.0, which the VoxelView/Ultra product runs
under. A component of the VoxelView product is a rendering ``engine'' that
takes voxel volume and rendering parameters and produces an image of
volume rendered.

    Vital Images said the VoxelView/Ultra product costs $40,000 for a
version that runs on SGI's IRIS/4D VGX Powervision computer. A version of
the VoxelView/E for SGI's Personal IRIS workstations costs $20,000, while
a Voxel/View/Plus 2.0 for SGI's IRIS/4D GT and GTX workstations costs
$30,000.  All of the products will ship this June.

Four RDBMS Gateways Bow

    Burlington, Mass.-SQL Solutions has introduced four models of its
Gateway, a product that lets users access and manipulate data stored in
Oracle, Rdb, Ingres and Informix relational database management systems as
if the data were stored in a Sybase SQL Server environment.

    The Gateway can help users migrate from those RDBMSes to Sybase while
preserving their data investments, said Dan Cronin, SQL Solutions' vice
president of marketing. The Gateway also allows any third-party front-end
tool to be used on any of those four back-end databases, by means of the
Sybase SQL Client, an application programming interface (API).

    A separate Gateway is required to access each of the four RDBMSes for
which the product is available. With multiple gateways, several RDBMSes
can be accessed concurrently.

    The Gateways for Unix platforms sll for between $5,000 and $14,000,
depending on the size of the machine, and are available for Ultrix and
SunOS. SQL Solutions can be reached at 617-270-4150.

Spotlight On Serial X Terminals -- GraphOn, NCD Machines Offer Special
Protocols, Neatly Fill The X Serial Void

By  JASON LEVITT



    Back in the '70s, when American Motors and disco ruled the Earth and
the acronym GUI was never heard, companies invested millions in ASCII
terminal technology because it was cheap, standard and vendor-independent.
Today, many of the same companies are contemplating replacement of those
ASCII terminals with X terminals. X technology is also cheap, standard and
vendor-independent, and has the added attraction of an advanced

    GUI and considerable flexibility. Most companies that  are switching
will replace their RS232 serial connections with Ethernet, but RS232 will
still make sense in some situations such as modem connections and in
locations where it is too expensive or logistically difficult to lay
Ethernet.

     In these cases, why not run X over existing serial lines? This is a
good idea, and nearly every X-terminal and workstation vendor supports
SL/IP (Serial Line Internet Protocol), the de facto standard for such
serial connections. However, SL/IP has a number of deficiencies, such as
lack of data compression and robust error detection, that make it less
than adequate for X-

    Window use. Point to Point Protocol (PPP) is a better solution, but it
will be a while before implementations are widely available.


     Filling the X serial void are two companies, GraphOn and NCD, who
have
developed their own serial protocols designed specifically for running X over

serial connections. NCD's protocol, XRemote, runs only on NCD X terminals
equipped with special XRemote PROMs. GraphOn has no special name for its
protocol, which is built in to the GraphOn X terminal firmware. (We will
just call it the GraphOn protocol.)

     The primary customers for these protocols are individuals and
companies involved in remote computing over phone lines using modems, and,
to a lesser extent, those interested in running X over inexpensive and
convenient direct RS232 serial connections.


X BY DESIGN

     As Fig. 1 shows, GraphOn and NCD tackle the serial problem in
different ways with different degrees of success.

     The GraphOn approach splits the X server between host and X terminal.
The device-independent (dix) portion of the X server, which handles the
bulk of X-Window server functionality, runs on the host, where it can take
advantage of virtual memory, higher I/O throughput and raw CPU power. The
device-dependent layer (ddx), the part that vendors must port to their
monitor, CPU, mouse and keyboard specifications, is split between the X
terminal and the host.

     With the bulk of the server on the host, GraphOn can be very
intelligent about what it sends down the wire to the X terminal. Many
screen events that would normally generate a flurry of packet activity
between a typical X terminal and host generate little or no activity with
GraphOn. Error correction and compression ensures that any traffic
generated moves quickly and safely. GraphOn uses a sliding-window protocol
with 14-bit checksum and Lempel-Ziv compression. It can operate over 7-bit
and 8-bit data paths.

     Because the GraphOn can use host resources to store pixmaps, fonts
and other server data, very little RAM is required inside the X terminal;
consequently, the GraphOn 19 comes with 1 Mbyte of RAM standard. There are
no upgrades available; according to GraphOn, none are needed. Having a
host-resident server means that the X application can use the host's
virtual memory instead of being limited to the amount of physical RAM in
the X terminal as is NCD.

     NCD takes a rather conventional approach to the problem by basically
replacing the TCP/IP protocol normally used to transport X protocol
packets with their own custom protocol stack, called XRemote. XRemote uses
a sliding-window protocol with 16-bit CRC error correction and a
proprietary compression technique to transfer X protocol packets over the
serial line to and from the X server. Unlike GraphOn, XRemote cannot use a
7-bit data path. This will be a disadvantage if your serial lines support
only 7 bits, which is sometimes true of older installations.

     Unlike GraphOn, NCD makes no attempt to alter the basic logic of the
MIT X server; X clients communicate with the XRemote daemon running on the
host, which exchanges X protocol packets with the X server running on the
terminal. The lower layer of the XRemote protocol is similar to the
emerging PPP standard, which indicates that NCD may ultimately support
PPP. PPP is a serial protocol that is expected to replace SL/IP.

     A SL/IP connection, which has no compression and poor error
correction, is illustrated in the first part of Fig. 1. (For more details
about SL/IP and PPP, see ``Two Protocols Worth Observing,'' in the Jan. 7,
1991, issue of UNIX Today!)

     In order to get a ``feel'' for the relative speed of XRemote and
SL/IP, Table 1 displays some comparative benchmark results. As you can
see, 9,600-bps SL/IP runs at about 1/10 to 1/20 the speed of Ethernet,
while direct 9,600 bps XRemote runs about 5 times faster than SL/IP. This
contradicts NCD's XRemote documentation which claims that it is 10 times
faster than SL/IP.


SETTING THINGS UP

         Thanks to thoughtful software engineering from both NCD and
GraphOn, setting up serial X connections is quite easy. In the UNIX Today!
lab, equipped with a SPARCstation 1 (SS1) host on loan from Apex

    Computers of Redmond, Wash., a GraphOn 21 X terminal and an NCD19 X
terminal, connections were established using both direct serial cables and
9696 V.32 modems from FastComm of Reston, Va.

     The first step is to load the appropriate software tape onto your
host system. NCD and GraphOn sell tapes for popular Unix systems. Both the
NCD and GraphOn tapes contain binaries, fonts, start-up files and tools
for use with the XRemote and GraphOn protocols. The latest beta NCD
version, which was not tested, includes a terminal-resident,
Motif-compatible window manager that should prove popular.

     Firing up the X terminals is simply a matter of switching them on,
because the protocols are supported entirely from internal firmware. If
you already own an NCD X terminal with the standard server PROMs, you will
have to replace them with the XRemote server PROMs. The NCD PROMs are
conveniently accessible through a small slot on the back of the CPU box.
Swapping them out takes 30 minutes or so.

     Establishing a connection between the X terminal and host is done via
a built-in terminal emulator that each terminal supports. If the
connection is direct, you immediately see a login prompt on your X
terminal. If you are using a modem, you use the usual Hayes commands to
dial the modem attached to the host. Once logged in, you simply type
xinitremote for XRemote or startxgo -pl 3 for GraphOn, and the X server
connection is automatically established.

    At a minimum, a single xterm client is launched. To exit the X server
connection and return to the terminal emulator screen, you exit all X
clients.


    The display name for both GraphOn and XRemote is testbed:1.0, where
testbed is the name of the SPARCstation host. When running the XRemote and
GraphOn protocols over serial lines, the X terminals logically exist as
extra displays attached to the host rather than separate nodes on the
network.

    If you are establishing a modem connection, it is important to use a
full-duplex modem. NCD recommends the FastComm modems, which support the
recent V.32 full-duplex standard. Half-duplex modems, like the Telebit
Trailblazer Plus using their PEP mode, are fine for file transfers where
most of the data traffic flows in one direction at a time, but interactive
sessions require that data flow in both directions simultaneously for best
results.

     The newer Telebit T2500 or T1600 provide V.32 in addition to PEP.
Most V.32 modems optionally provide hardware data compression and error
correction, but these must be disabled when using XRemote or GraphOn
because data compression and error correction are provided by the
protocols. Using these modem options actually slows throughput because
they provide no additional functionality, yet require compute time.


FLEXIBILITY AND PACKAGING

         Both the NCD and GraphOn X terminals have unusual cabinet designs
as X terminals go. The GraphOn 21 is an ``all-in-one'' unit with the usual
pizza box electronics stuffed inside the back of the monitor. This
actually makes it the most compact 21-inch monitor I've ever seen. The
NCD19 has a bracket for attaching the monitor to the base unit, thus
turning it into a single unit as well. Both machines have thick and thin
Ethernet ports and a serial port. The serial ports on the NCD and GraphOn
are configurable up to 38,400 and 57,600 bps, respectively. (For more
general software and hardware details, see ``X Terminals: The Ratings Are
In,'' in the April 1, 1991, issue of UNIX Today!)

     With the XRemote PROMs installed, the NCD19 can run the XRemote
protocol over the serial port or over Ethernet. If you want to use the NCD
with TCP/IP and X protocol over Ethernet, you can download the NCD X
server into it from the host, provided you purchase the regular
(non-XRemote) boot tape and load it on the host.

    The GraphOn runs GraphOn protocol over its serial port or Ethernet,
but GraphOn does not offer a version that sends X-Window protocol over the
wire.

     The ability to use the NCD as both a standard Ethernet-based X
terminal and XRemote serial X terminal is a big plus for those needing
connectivity in both environments.


PRICE

     Ask anyone why they purchased an X terminal, and they will probably
mention the price. X terminals are inexpensive and are rapidly becoming
cheaper. Their low cost per seat has been a major influence on their
market acceptance. A quick price accounting gives GraphOn a definite edge.

     A complete low-end monochrome NCD XRemote package comes to $3,045
(NCD15b with 5 Mbytes, $2,245, plus XRemote PROMs, $300, plus Sun boot
tape, $500), while the low-end GraphOn, which has no Ethernet capability,
comes in at $1,390 (GraphOn 14, $995, plus Sun boot tape, $395). Both boot
tapes include site-wide licenses, so you pay for the tape only once.

     For the tested high-end monochrome systems, the price disparity is
even greater. The NCD19 comes in at $5,300 (NCD19 with 8 Mbytes of RAM,
$4,400, plus XRemote PROMs, $400, plus Sun boot tape, $500), while the
GraphOn 21 is $2,390 (GraphOn 21, $1,995, plus Sun boot tape, $395). It is
important to note that the prices on the NCD terminals can be cut by
hundreds of dollars if third-party memory SIMMs are purchased.


PHILOSOPHY OF PERFORMANCE

     The NCD19 ran two to three times faster than the GraphOn 21 over
Ethernet, which comes as no surprise to anyone. The NCD has excellent
server software that speaks native X-Window protocol encapsulated by
TCP/IP. The GraphOn 21 has Ethernet connectors and can run over Ethernet,
but the packets contain GraphOn protocol, which is designed for efficiency
over serial links, not Ethernet.

     Over serial links, however, the NCD and GraphOn are comparable
systems. Table 2 is a range chart with a logarithmic scale showing the
ratios of GraphOn 9,600-bps and XRemote 9,600-bps results compared to an
NCD19 SL/IP connection at 9,600 bps. The results are for direct 9,600-bps
serial connections.

     Each box shows the full range of ratios for the given category of
tests from the x11perf benchmark suite. The bold line within each box is
the geometric mean of all the ratios represented by the box. The purpose
of each box is to show how performance varies within each category of
tests.

    In the General Graphics category, the GraphOn results ranged from 0.01
of SL/IP performance to 2.0 times the speed of SL/IP, while the geometric
mean of all the results, the bold line, places the overall score at about
0.2 of SL/IP. The information is incomplete because the box does not tell
you which tests score low and which score high.

    GraphOn tends to do quite well on common X drawing operations such as
thin lines, dots, and rectangles, but worse on less common graphics such
as filled ellipses. The GraphOn has only a small number of drawing
primitives in its terminal firmware, so it has to send many drawing
requests from the host to complete complex graphics. Because NCD's XRemote
is sending X-Window packets, it sends only a few drawing requests to its X
terminal server, and then all the drawing and computation take place in
the terminal.

    The GraphOn performs admirably, however, in terminal emulation, window
management and X-specific operations. GraphOn's slim procotol and split
server personality allow better than or equal performance on common X
functionality.

     Although the results here are for direct 9,600-bps connections, modem
connections at 9,600 bps should be similar though somewhat slower because
of modulation/demodulation and the occasional noisy packet that has to be
retransmitted.

     While the GraphOn does well in these benchmarks, the mostly
host-resident X server steals CPU cycles from the host. For each GraphOn
terminal attached, another X server process is created on the host. Though
the NCD X server runs in the X terminal, the XRemote daemon runs on the
host, and each NCD X terminal attached to the host requires its own
XRemote daemon process. So what percentage of CPU and memory do the
XRemote and GraphOn processes require?

     To get a rough idea, I used a 9,600-bps direct serial connection and
ran three copies of the X demo program ico that displays a rotating
isosahedron. This keeps a continuous stream of packets on the wire. I then
ran the command ps -au every four seconds and grep'ed on the XRemote or
GraphOn process. For the NCD19, the XRemote process required about 3
percent CPU and 3 percent system RAM. For the GraphOn, it was 7 percent
CPU and 6.5 percent RAM. These results suggest that the GraphOn requires
about twice the host resources as XRemote.

     On the purely subjective side of things, I ran several common X
applications such as bitmap and muncher as well as a full-blown commercial
application, Asterix, a spreadsheet, word processor and data management
tool from Applix (508-870-0300).

    The most noticeable effect of running several applications
simultaneously was that the GraphOn handled obscured windows better than
XRemote, because GraphOn was more intelligent about screen updating.

    For those wondering about window manager compatibility, I successfully
ran the Motif 1.03 and OpenWindows 2.0 window managers on both systems.
They also claim to support the DECwindows manager.

    Complete benchmark results can be obtained on the machine uunet.uu.net
(UUNET Communications Services, Falls Church, Va.) in the
/unix-today/benchmarks directory. The file 51391.bench.tar.Z contains the
raw data that was processed using the shell script x11perfcompDR.


A WORD ABOUT 2,400

     The benchmark tests were run at 9,600 bps, but what about 2,400 bps?
Can it be done? The answer is no and sort of. Running SL/IP at 2,400 bps
is out of the question. XRemote at 2,400 bps was barely usable, but was
bearable with no window manager running and only two or three xterm
windows. As you might expect, the GraphOn makes a great terminal
multiplexor and does surprisingly well, though not spectacularly, at 2,400
bps. Continual screen output to one xterm window tended to lock things up
a bit, but was nonetheless usable.


CONCLUSIONS

    For someone who is serious about dedicated serial connections, the
GraphOn is a good pick. Its extremely low-cost, host-based XR3 server and
responsive serial performance make it an excellent choice.

   However, if you ever intend to use your terminal with Ethernet, the
GraphOn will probably disappoint, as it is quite slow and awkward compared
to other Ethernet-connected X terminals. The GraphOn makes the most sense
when used exclusively for serial communications.

   If flexibility and future options are an issue, the NCD has the ability
to run well over serial lines using either its XR4-based XRemote or SL/IP
and, when attached to Ethernet, is among the most robust and
highest-performing monochrome X terminals available.

    The UNIX Today! Labs are distributed among New York, Maryland and
Texas. Technical free-lancers also test products in their labs to our
specifications.

A Look At The Mips R4000 Chip -- Why Mips Selected The Simplicity Of
Superpipelining Over A Superscalar Design

By  ROBERT B. K. DEWAR AND MATTHEW SMOSNA



    In one of the earlier articles of this series, we described how RISC
architects are attempting to break the one-instruction-per-cycle-barrier
through the use of either superscalar designs or superpipelining. Of all
the major players in the RISC wars, only Mips developed an architecture
based on the superpipelined approach. In this article, we will take a look
at that architecture and try to explain why Mips chose superpipelining
over a superscalar approach.

     The R4000 is not only technically interesting, it recently made the
front page of the business section in papers all over the country when it
was chosen as the RISC processor for the newly created Advanced Computing
Environment (ACE), a project including several top software and hardware
companies including Microsoft, SCO, Compaq, DEC as well as Mips (see
front-page article in UNIX Today!, April 15, 1991). The ACE companies
announced that the Mips R4000 is planned as the main RISC hardware
platform for SCO's Unix and Microsoft's OS/2. Notably absent from the list
of companies supporting ACE are other major suppliers of workstations
including HP, Sun and IBM. An interesting contest is shaping up here.


THE MIPS R4000 SUPERPIPELINE

     The Mips R4000 Superpipeline builds on the earlier Mips R3000 chip.
Instead of a simple 5-cycle pipeline, the R4000 uses an 8-stage pipeline.
Notice that two stages are executed in each external clock cycle
(internally the chip subdivides the clock signal, to give an internal
speed twice that of the external clock). The eight stages of the pipeline
are:

     IF: Instruction fetch, during which the first of two instructions to
be fetched into the pipeline is loaded from the instruction cache.

     IS: The second half of the instruction fetch cycle (this overlaps the
following IF phase, i.e., the fetch of the second instruction).

     RF: Register fetch, during which operands in

    Robert B. K. Dewar is professor of computer science and Matthew Smosna
is computer systems manager at the Courant Institute of NYU. They are the
authors of Microprocessors, A Programmer's View, published by McGraw-Hill.

    registers are fetched.

     EX: Execute (the operation is performed).

     DF: Data fetch, during which a memory reference results in the data
being loaded (we hope) from the data cache.

     DS: The second half of the data-cache cycle, which overlaps the
subsequent DF phase (i.e., the second instruction's data cache load occurs
here).

     TC: Tag check, during which an addressing translation tag or TLB
(Translation Lookaside Buffer) check is made.

     WB: Write back, during which the result is written back to the
register file or memory.

     Keep in mind that these stages sometimes have different functions
depending on the instruction that is being executed (for example, an
integer arithmetic instruction will not use the DF and DS stages, as such
instructions can only have their operands in registers-there are no
references to the data cache).

     A very interesting aspect of the R4000 pipeline is the lack of
restrictions on the instructions entering the pipeline. Some
superpipelined processors require the instruction mix to be balanced
(certain types of instructions must enter the pipeline at certain times in
order for the processor to work-the Intel i860, for example). Other
processors, such as the IBM RS/6000, do not require any specific mix, but
do have better performance when the mix it right.

     A superpipelined approach in which two instructions are processed on
each external clock basically performs similarly to a superscalar design
with two separate instruction streams processed in parallel. Comparing the
R4000 to the IBM RS/6000, we might still expect that the IBM processor
have an advantage in that it can issue up to four instructions at once.

     However, Mips claims that in practice this potential advantage is
seldom exploited, and that there will not be a significant performance
difference. Looking at the performance of the RS/6000, we typically see
instruction rates that do not exceed two instructions per clock except in
specialized situations, so this may be a fair overall judgment-of course,
we will have to wait for the first R4000-based machines to be sure.

    Mips claims that the advantage to its superpipelined approach is
basically a much simpler hardware design than the corresponding
superscalar design. If it is really true that there is no substantial
performance difference, then this simplicity is an advantage that may
translate into higher clock rates and cheaper fabrication. Again, we will
have to wait to see whether this theoretical advantage materializes in
practice.


THE INTEGER UNIT

     Although the Mips R4000 distinguishes itself in the use of
superpipelining, it is also one of the first processors to be implemented
as a full 64-bit architecture. The IU registers are 64 bits wide, and the
data paths to the cache are also 64 bits wide. While the R3000 had integer
operations of 8, 16 and 32 bits, the R4000 extends these to full 64-bit
operations while maintaining object code compatibility with the R3000.
These computational instructions are performed in registers, with only two
addressing modes supported: All operands in registers or one of the
operands being a 16-bit immediate value. The instruction set includes
loads and stores that can be done 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits at a time (they
must be aligned), and like other RISC architectures, loads and stores are
the only instructions that can access memory.

    In an interesting change of emphasis, the R4000 uses interlocks, that
is, the instruction that immediately follows a load may use the contents
of the register that is being loaded. The Mips R3000, and earlier chips
produced by MIPS, distinguished themselves by not using interlocks. In
fact, the acronym Mips originally stood for Microprocessor without
Interlocking Pipeline Stages, but now Mips is just a company name that
doesn't stand for anything but itself.

     The integer instruction set is very basic. In the Mips design, RISC
turns out to mean a small set of instructions as well as a simplified
design for instructions. As we have seen on other RISC chips, such as the
HP precision, it is not necessarily the case that RISC implies small
instruction sets, but the MIPS design takes a minimal view-you won't find
decimal arithmetic, fancy shifts or string instructions on this processor!
One small point is that the integer operations have an option to trap
automatically on overflow-a feature that is very useful if you need to
check overflow. (This is required in Ada compilers.) The instruction set
also does include an integer multiply and divide.


FLOATING-POINT UNIT

     The floating-point unit is implemented on-chip (on the R3000,
floating point was implemented on a separate chip, the R3010). It is
IEEE-compatible, with Mips claiming a 25 percent improvement in
performance over the R3010. Until we see benchmarks, it is hard to predict
exactly how fast it will be-it will probably not quite measure up to the
top performance level of the RS/6000, but this depends on what clock
speeds can be achieved.

     The register set of the FPU is configurable as either 16 64-bit
registers or as 32 32-bit registers. Because of the 64-bit wide data path,
loads and stores to these registers can be done in a single cycle (unlike
the 2 cycles required for double-precision floating-point on earlier Mips
designs).

     Fully precise floating-point interrupts are implemented on the R4000.
As we discussed in the last article on the HP PA-RISC architecture, this
allows for user-defined trap routines as suggested by the IEEE standard by
pre-examining any operands that might result in an overflow. This is a
very important feature if overflow trapping is required-by contrast, the
RS/6000 can achieve automatic trapping only by disconnecting the
floating-point pipeline, with a huge execution penalty as a result.


THE SYSTEM COPROCESSOR

     The system coprocessor of the R4000 implements the virtual memory, a
TLB, cache management, exception handling and I/O. It contains its own
internal set of registers for control of these system features.

     The R4000 is able to operate in three modes: a user mode that
provides a flat virtual address space to the user, a kernel mode with four
virtual address spaces and a supervisor mode with two regions. Again, here
the architecture is a full 64-bit architecture, with all virtual addresses
allowing access to the full addressing space (although, for instance, the
user mode gives a user access to only half of the space, the other half
being reserved for the system).

     The effectiveness of the cache is critical to any RISC machine, but
the designers of the R4000 have placed a particular emphasis on its
implementation.

    Both the instruction and the data caches have their own 64-bit data
paths, and both can be accessed independently in a single cycle. Initial
versions of the R4000 will have only 8k bytes of on-chip instruction and
data cache each, but it is clearly the intent here to increase this amount
later. An external secondary cache of up to 4 Mbytes can be added when
required by the system architecture.

     The instruction cache is virtually indexed and physically tagged. As
a result, while instruction lookup is being done in the instruction cache,
virtual address translation is done simultaneously just in case a cache
miss occurs.

    The data cache is direct-mapped write-back cache with a line size that
can be configured as four or eight words. A ``store buffer'' allows the
R4000 to do two stores to slow memory on each cycle.

     The Mips R4000 clearly derives much of its design from the earlier
R3000, but incorporates a significant new design: the superpipeline. In
addition, the FPU has been brought onboard the chip, and the cache design
has been enhanced.

    But the use of superpipelined design is what distinguishes the
Mips-its use differentiates it from other RISC processors. The question
is, has MIPS staked out a claim that will result in beating the other RISC
designs (including the processors that use a superscalar approach, and
also the HP precision architecture, which uses a The floating-point unit
is implemented on the chip.

    conventional approach but a very fast clock?) As usual, we won't
really be able to find out the answer to this question until we get
silicon in our hands and can actually run the benchmarks.

     Another critical issue is the importance of making the jump to a true
64-bit architecture. Right now, 32-bit integers and a 4-gigabyte address
space satisfy most users. Mips is betting that these limitations will
start to hurt soon. The history of computing has been full of statements
like ``No one could possibly need more than `X' memory.'' The first such
statement is attributed to Van Neuman with X = 4k bytes! Are the other
RISC manufacturers who say that no one could need more than 4 gigabytes
making the same historic mistake? Mips thinks they are, and if they are
right, getting there first to the true 64-bit address space could be a
winning move.

Analyzing Program Performance -- Key Tools To Help You Size Up The
Performance Of Your Application Software

By  MIKE CARL



    People the world over are seeing our natural resources less as a

commodity and more as a precious treasure. From toasters to automobiles,
the claims of ``energy efficiency'' are now vogue. Most Unix applications,
on the other hand, tend to need increasing amounts of compute resources.

     Almost weekly, hardware manufacturers crank out faster processors or
higher-capacity memory and storage devices. Just glance at a data sheet
for a typical personal workstation. In order to run a commercial grade of
Unix with an X-Window System, we're talking a 32-bit processor with at
least a 20-MHz clock, 16 Mbytes of RAM and a bare-minimum 100-Mbyte hard
disk.

     With such a configuration, solid and responsive performance should
not be a problem, right? The answer eludes a simple reply, but suffice it
to say that with each gain in hardware performance and capacity, systems
and application software make lock-step demands of these gains to render
new functionality.

    Many users are price-sensitive and can't make the investments in
hardware upgrades. I still see a lot of Sun 3/50s with 4 Mbytes of memory
being used to run an X server and assorted X clients. Or consider the
number of Intel 386 users who are running Unix and X. Obviously,
performance isn't the big attraction; being able to run some of the
exciting new X applications is.

     Lines of source code number in the thousands for many non-X-Window
applications running on Unix. Adding an X-Window interface will make the
application grow like Liz Taylor with a dessert menu. For example, xmh,
the X front end to the MH mail programs, adds more than 7,000 lines of
source code.

     Under that kind of weight, finding

    Mike Carl is a software tester for Teknekron Software Systems in Palo
Alto, Calif.

    and making performance improvements requires time, hardly a commodity
when the release date is near and you are still debugging problems.
However, some primitive performance analysis tools are delivered with your
Unix system.



UNIX TIME

     The first and simplest is the time command. This command exists in
two forms: a built-in portion of the C shell and a program located in /bin
or /usr/5bin on SunOS. The C shell's time command displays statistics
about how a program uses system resources as well as the CPU time spent in
the kernel and in the program. An example run of time on a SPARCstation 2
would be as follows:

        The program being tested here, qsort, generates an array of 50,000
random integers and then sorts them uses the Quicksort algorithm created
by C. Anthony R. Hoare in 1962.

    The 3.1u reveals that qsort spent 3.1 seconds of CPU time in the user
program, while the kernel (or system) took 0.1 seconds to perform services
on behalf of qsort. The third value from the left is the total elapsed
time. The next value represents the user and system time as a percentage
of the elapsed time. Due to rounding, these numbers are not always
precise. The remaining statistics detail the program's memory use,
physical I/O and paging.

     Because Unix is capable of running several processes, time statistics
can be affected by other processes getting a time slice. To better control
such variance, try taking an average of time statistics while the system's
load is low.

     Data gathered here could prove useful as a baseline for
troubleshooting or benchmarking subsequent releases of a program. Thus,
you can see the effect of a new library, or you may even want to increase
buffer size to lower physical I/O.


DID YOU GET A PROFILE?

     When efficiency is important, getting an execution profile is an
excellent first step in finding where a program spends most of its time.
The Unix command prof(1) displays such profile data. Before running prof,
you must first compile the programs to be studied using the -p option of
cc(1V). The prof results for the qsort program above are shown in Fig. 1.

     For each routine, prof displays the time taken by the routine as a
percentage of the total run time of the program (%time), together with the
number of times that routine was called (call) and the number of
milliseconds used per call (ms/call). The cumsecs column displays a
running total of the seconds taken by the routine in addition to the
routines listed above it.

     The figure points out that 43 percent of the program's running time
is spent in a subroutine of the qsort program called partition(). The
partition() routine is the workhorse of the ``divide and conquer'' idea
underlying Quicksort.

     The profile data also reveal a large number of calls made to the
swap() routine (swap exchanges two unsorted elements). Armed with this
data, you can make significant performance improvements by improving the
logic in partition() or by reducing the number of calls to swap().

     Although a lot of information can be gained from prof, it may not be
sufficient to point out every area where improvements can be made. What is
not clear from prof's output is that qsort has a recursive implementation.
The effect of called routines, and routines recursively calling
themselves, is detailed with the profile of each caller in the performance
tool called gprof(1). Your system may not provide gprof. This profile
results from the data file created by compiling the programs with the -pg
option of cc(1V).  Let's get a call graph profile of the qsort program
used above.

     Fig. 2 displays the portion of the call graph profile that reveals
the recursion. The listing shows the routines in order of execution,
including the time taken by any descendent routine calls. To locate
recursive routine calls, look down the column containing ``called+self.''
For quicksort(), one finds the value ``1+69750,'' which means that
quicksort() is ``called'' one time in the main cycle, but quicksort() goes
on to call itself 69,750 times.

     The algorithm chosen for the qsort program need not be recursive. An
equivalent iterative algorithm could have been implemented. Using
recursion, however, simplifies the program and requires fewer variables.
Consequently, the program is easier to maintain and understand. The
downside is that with each recursive call, the function's arguments must
be pushed onto a stack, inflicting a time and space penalty.

     After you've squeezed all the performance enhancements out of your
program, follow-up profile data probably won't reveal any performance
spikes, and the granularity of the data collection will make further
improvements difficult.


STATEMENT-BY-STATEMENT ANALYSIS

     Code coverage performs statement-by-statement analysis on a program
and displays which statements are executed and how many times. Code
coverage can identify areas of code that never get executed, which might
imply areas of code that are not being measured or tested.

     The command tcov(1) produces a code coverage analysis and
statement-by-statement profile of a program. The program must be compiled
with the -a option to produce the analysis. Each time the program is
executed, code coverage data is accumulated in a file with the same name
as the program, but with a ``.d'' suffix. Next, the tcov program must be
executed with the source code file as its argument. Tcov reads the
corresponding .d file and creates a listing of the source with coverage
data in a similarly named file with a ``.tcov'' suffix. Fig. 3 gives the
exact iterations for each statement in the partition() routine.


ANALYZING X APPLICATIONS

     The performance analysis tools discussed so far are most useful for
programs that follow a fairly predictable order of execution. Getting your
arms around the performance characteristics of a program developed for the
X-Window System is inherently more difficult.

     At the heart of a typical X application lies an event loop. The
number and order of the execution paths through an X program depend on how
an end user interfaces with the program. For instance, users can choose
available functions from menus and enter text fields in many different
orders. Even the user's interactions with other applications can affect
the program (e.g., opening or closing another window).

     Add to the above difficulty the distributed nature of the X-Window
System (clients and servers can run on different machines). X application
performance depends greatly on the load on the network and the various
machine loads. The performance of the X server software is also a critical
factor. Although you usually do not have the source code to the server and
therefore cannot change the code, you can improve performance by
determining the best ways to interact with the server.


     Two tools exist today for measuring the display performance of X
servers, namely x11perf and xbench. Let's look at a well-known hot spot
with the performance of an X11R4 server (Xsun) in filling a
100-by-100-pixel trapezoid . Running x11perf on a SPARCstation 2 with
SunOS 4.1.1, we get the 550.0 repetitions/sec for filling a 100-by-100
trapezoid with a solid color; 46.5 repetitions/sec if the trapezoid is
stippled; and 41.7 repetitions/sec if the trapezoid is tiled (checkered).

     Note the factor of 10 difference in filling the trapezoid with
stipples or tiles. The take-home lesson here is: You will be trading away
display performance by an order of magnitude when filling objects like
trapezoids with stipples or tiles.

     Certainly the display speed of an X server will greatly influence the
overall perceived performance of an X client. However, X application
developers should assume worst-case, and code for optimal performance of
their client application. One tool that can be of aid in understanding an
X application's efficiency is xscope.

     Running as a separate process, xscope monitors the connections
between the X11 window server and a client program. Sitting between a
client and an X11 server, xscope outputs the contents of each request,
reply, error or event that is communicated between them. For instance,
with xscope a programmer who made liberal use of XFlush or XSync might
notice several ``replies'' coming from the X server to acknowledge the
client's requests.

     The majority of Xlib calls don't require a reply from the X server.
Consequently, calls that require a reply from the server, sometimes called
``round-trip requests,'' can induce greater network traffic. Although most
traffic generated by X clients and servers rarely taxes the network
bandwidth, prudent use of roundtrip requests such as XFlush() and XSync()
is a good defense against poor performance when the network gets saturated
by a large remote file transfer.

     Complete performance analysis of application software doesn't come
easy, because you are not necessarily seeing solely the performance
characteristics of the application, but also getting variances imposed by
the network, the underlying operating system and other components such as
the X server. You may liken performance analysis and tuning to defensive
driving. While behind the wheel, the defensive driver may not predict all
potential hazards on the road, but tries to see ``the whole road'' and
recognize possible trouble spots.

SORCERER'S APPRENTICE

By  SEAN FULTON



In order to have a fully functional USENET site, you need a news reader, a
news transport and a method to your madness. In truth, setting up USENET
news on an SCO Unix box isn't that difficult if you can get around the
finicky new Microsoft C compiler that complains about sloppy endifs.

     When I moved our 386 from SCO Xenix to SCO Unix last summer, the
biggest problem I faced was pleasing the compiler. Having accomplished
that, maintaining and reading news on our 386 is back to what it once
was-a forgettable task.

     But Unix 3.2 brought with it a host of networking options I never
dreamed of with Xenix, and after carefully weighing our initial steps, I
decided to plunge headlong into the abyss.

      On our Xenix box, all users read news from terminals connected
either directly or via modems. Unix, with its TCP/IP support and NFS,
provides the network allure, a smell of connectivity and openness that I
hadn't even contemplated before.

     Why not set up a system where users on one PC could read news on
another? Colleges and universities do it with Sun and DEC boxes all the
time, so why not tackle the problem on our 386?

     For this project, I used two 386 boxes loaded with SCO Unix 3.2.2 and
TCP/IP.

     To those SCO boxes I added CNEWS source on the server, trn source on
the news ``client'' and NNTP source to both machines. NNTP stands for
Network News Transport Protocol. NNTP allows two forms of networked news
transfer: by article, in a situation such as the one I planned to install,
and by batch, as in two separate news servers sending news batches to each
other over a TCP/IP net.

     The server side compiled with few problems. I built CNEWS first, then
spent the next several hours debugging the NNTP source.

     I also had to do some serious tweaking to the config.h file,
convincing it that I was using the CNEWS dbz database routines, since SCO
Unix did not have its own. I also had to move our CNEWS library files from
the CNEWS source directories to /usr/lib/cnews.a so the compiler could
find them for making NNTP.

     Having accomplished all this, I was able to compile the NNTP server
side of our application with few problems. Then came the hard part. I
built trn, telling it that I wanted to use the built-in NNTP extensions
and the NNTP client resources. After a few attempts at compiling the
source, I realized I needed to move the libcnews.a file from our server
onto the client machine. The file is created during construction of CNEWS,
but apparently it is needed by trn as well.

     The whole mess compiled, and I was ready, I thought, to start some
down-and-dirty news reading.

     But wait! What's this?

    ``usr/lib/news/inews:/usr/lib/news/inews not found . . .''

         I searched through both the trn and NNTP source looking for a
reference to inews, but found none. Somewhere, the NNTP client (a
hard-wired version of inews used to post articles to the remote machine)
had arbitrarily decided that our NEWSCTL directory was the place to find
inews on the server machine.

   Finally short of patience, I simply copied the inews script from our
trn source to the server, installed it in the /usr/lib/news directory and
tried again.

     This time it worked. Within seconds, trn was setting up a .newsrc on
our client machine, then reading in groups from the server. All told, the
project took two days to master, and countless hours of banging on
keyboards and table-tops, but it was finally accomplished.

SYSTEM'S ADMINISTRATION

By  BRUCE HUNTER



Everyone must love the X-Window system, because they all use it. Some
users think that they are not using X-Window, but instead are using Motif
or Open Look; but these are simply different window managers, which all
run on the same X system, as we shall see.

     The presence of X-Window can greatly affect the lives of systems
administrators, giving them many and varied duties-they must request and
install physical resources for X, install the new X releases, create and
install user start-up file scripts, and install and maintain X filesystems
on file servers. They must understand X process management, maintain X's
resource files, and be able to troubleshoot X and understand its resource
requirements.

     X heavily affects the resource use of workstations; X is both CPU-
and memory-intensive. Eight Mbytes of memory are required for monochrome
systems. For color, X requires at least 12 Mbytes for the older and
smaller X10, and 16 Mbytes for X11. Both need a minimum of 4 MIPS and
should have 64 Mbytes of swap space. In fact, X Version 11 Revision 3 is
dismally slow even at 4 MIPS, but it looks great at 18 MIPS. X requires a
high-resolution screen-higher than VGA, so be prepared to invest in
high-resolution terminals or monitors.

     X also affects your fileservers. At least 1/2 to 1 gigabyte of
additional fileserver disk space is required, and additional CPU capacity
will be needed if you use X terminals. We'll get into what those are
later.

     To administer X, you must know how X works, for X redefines the terms
server and client. In fact, the meanings are almost reversed from the
conventional fileserver/workstation relationship. Typically, your
workstation application is the client, and the workstation sends requests
to the server; however, from the X perspective, the terminal server runs
on the workstation and handles your keyboard, mouse and screen, and the
clients are the applications and can run anywhere on the network.

    Most workstation users use their system as their terminal server and
run clients there as well, but remember that the base part of X is a text-
and graphics-oriented system designed to do its work across the network.
Thus, X is designed to run on one system and display on another
(fascinating and compelling to users). As a result, users can run client
processes anywhere on the net that they have access rights, and they can
have the results in graphics and glorious X colors right at their desks.


     X-Window has two major parts. The basic windowing system, X, handles
the graphics, the graphics libraries and the network end (anything
required to make data travel back and forth between the terminal server
and the clients). The window manager (Open Look, Motif, or whatever) is
what users see, and that's what they perceive as X-Window.

     There are many window managers-uwm, twm and mwm (Motif) are just a
few. The choice of window managers is determined in part by the X release;
for example, X10 favors uwm, and X11 favors twm. Sometimes the user needs
a specific window manager for certain applications, such as a special
tool. Also, user preference and prejudice have a great deal to do with
selection of a window manager. For instance, some users prefer the slide
bars on Motif, whereas others fall in love with the ``look-and-feel'' of
Sun's Open Look.

     Tune in next time to find out more about actual X administration
tasks.

A Novel Procurement Program -- Canadian Transport Adopts Far-Reaching Unix
Midrange System Acquisition Program

By  DANIEL R. PERLEY



    In 1988, Transport Canada (TC), the Canadian federal government
department of transportation, initiated an innovative and far-reaching
standards-based procurement program. The Unit Level System (ULS)
Establishment Program has now completed all important vendor qualification
and field trial milestones. While not the first large Canadian government
procurement program to require open systems, the ULS program represented
some noteworthy firsts, even in the North American context.  The ULS
program:

    o Specified a common operating system use profile to promote
portability, scalability and inter-operability, allowing vendors in both
UI and OSF camps to compete;

    o Qualified not one but five competitive vendors (each of which was
required to mount an extensive field trial) and will now bid each system
buy on a price/availability basis among them; and

        o Employs specially trained and certified paraprofessionals as
local system administrators.

    TC has responsibility for the provision and oversight of a safe and
efficient transportation system for Canada and is divided into Aviation,
Airports, Marine, Surface Groups and various corporate/support groups,
together totaling more than 20,000 employees with almost 200 facilities
from coast to coast.

    The department operates numerous Coast Guard ships, a fleet of
fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and many motor vehicles. It manages
most airports, has responsibility for technical regulation, infrastructure
and traffic control in the air and marine modes, provides technical
regulation of rail and also sets motor vehicle standards.

    By the mid- to late 1980s, TC faced rapidly increasing demand in its
central IBM MVS mainframes/SNA network as well as an influx of many types
of personal computers. In addition, some operational elements operated
various minicomputers, most notably DEC PDP-11 and VAX systems. To ensure
that future capacity demands could be flexibly

    Daniel R. Perley served as director of intermediate informatics at
Transport Canada from 1988 to 1990 and in that capacity conceived and was
responsible for the ULS program. He rejoined the private sector in
mid-1990 and is president of Perley Technologies/PTC, an Ottawa-area
systems consulting firm.

 He met, the Director General Information Management Services (DGIMS)
organization within TC undertook a review of network and processing
requirements, which identified four levels of information management (and
information processing) within TC.  These were:

    o Enterprise (corporate-mainframe)

        o Area (regional-mainframe)

        o Unit (branch or directorate-minicomputer/midrange system)

        o Workplace (desktop or workbench-personal computer/terminal)

        At the workgroup (Unit) level, the department was forecasting a
requirement, over a five-year period, for up to 400 midrange computer
systems for use in information system, operational support, engineering,
scientific and technically embedded computing environments. However, at
that time TC possessed no central midrange system acquisition and support
program and no functional    guidance on the subject; local managers could
(and did) buy many incompatible types of equipment.

    While more than 80 types of PCs had already been acquired, at least
most of them adhered to the DOS/Intel or Mac standards. The prospect of 40
to 50 types of next-generation minicomputers (requiring new support
capabilities) posed a major challenge to senior informatics managers. The
ULS Establishment Program was set up to establish standards,
certification, acquisition channels and support mechanisms for five- to
50-user ULS (midrange) equipment.

    The program began in 1988 with a further internal review of TC
processing needs that highlighted a significant number of pending and
anticipated requests for midrange equipment. The DGIMS Intermediate
Informatics Branch was established to take responsibility for the midrange
computer program within TC. Interim Guidance on Mid-Range Systems was soon
issued, limiting all future purchases to those able to run a Unix
operating system derivative, interface with the IBM SNA network and
support an Ethernet and/or Token Ring LAN Interfaces.

    A multivendor strategy was believed superior either to a single-vendor
approach or one permitting many vendors to supply such equipment, as it
would prevent undue vendor dependence and allow price/performance
competition among a manageable number of suppliers.

    The Treasury Board (TB) of the Government of Canada provides central
coordination and management for government departments and also sets
standards, including technology standards. TB participates in many
international standards groups and had established an open systems
direction for the Canadian federal government. TB recommended POSIX, but
TC believed POSIX alone would be insufficient because TC desired to
exercise data environment, application software and data portability on
three axes:

    o Vertical portability among different sizes of computers at the
Enterprise (mainframe), Area (midframe), Unit (five- to 50-user midrange)
and Workplace (PC/workstation) levels;

    o Horizontal portability among similar computers within one level;


        o Forward portability to replacement computers at any level, and
likely from a different vendor.


    Clearly, POSIX alone would not permit this to occur. A commom
operating system was still required, and Unix was seen as the only viable
choice. Nonetheless, Unix itself was not monolithic; the hoped-for
convergence of ``the world'' into System V.4 was shattered as OSF (and
then UI) burst onto the scene.

    However, TC could not await the outcome of the battle of UI and OSF.
After much soul-searching, it was decided not to specify everything that
an operating system should or should not contain, but rather what part of
it would actually be used and thus must be present. This would restrict TC
software developers and users somewhat, but would permit vendors using
either Unix family to supply equipment while safeguarding portability.
Vendors were free to include third-party products to make up any
deficiencies against the specification.

    In practice, key elements such as kernel and kernel extension, shell
utilities and their extensions and certain other elements were certain to
be functionally common to both Unix families. UI and OSF both added other
elements; suppliers were required to provide everything inside the
vertical column on the functionality map show in the diagram on page 57.
Functionality outside the column would NOT be used by TC.

    This approach was called ``Greater Unix'' or ``GX'' because it made an
attempt to homogenize the difference among Unix variants by setting a
common ``How we will use it'' profile.

    Portability must be supported by several ``pillars,'' of which the
operating system definition or profile (here GX POSIX, with XPG3 added for
good measure) is only one. Also important are adherence to ANSI language
definitions, a common RDBMS (TC chose Oracle), a good development
methodology and use of OSI communications.

    TC first conducted a Demonstration and Evaluation Project (DEP) to
prove key concepts and permit staff to gain experience; AT&T 3B2 computers
served this purpose, with one installed to serve the new Intermediate
Informatics Branch itself in Ottawa and a second in Montreal. A workgroup
data management and work-flow control application called Basic Information
Control System (BICS) was implemented on these systems, along with the
Uniplex Office Automation (OA) package.

    This was followed by a full-scale pretrial, involving 50 users at the
Moncton, New Brunswick, regional Air Navigation office, using IBM RT
equipment. The integration of this system proved vastly more complicated
and time-consuming than IBM and TC had expected; however, it was finally
brought to operational status, at least for OA purposes.

    The pretrial did not fulfill TC expectations when running a multiuser
Oracle RDBMS application environment. However, the pretrial allowed
considerable refinement of administrative and operational procedures. A
much more comprehensive standard site implementation plan was developed,
and the problem of aligning PC terminal emulator key assignments with
RDBMS, OA and OS requirements was addressed.

    A full ULS program workplan was meanwhile approved, and specific
acquisition categories were established for ULS hardware, database
packages, office automation packages, system integration services and
application development services. A Request for Proposal (RFP) was
developed based upon a Qualification and Evaluation Criteria (QEC)
document that set out the parameters not only for paper qualification of
vendors but also for full evaluation in the field trials. The requirements
document placed considerable (and equal) stress on equipment performance,
vendor support and vendor commitment to present and future standards
adherence. A parallel specification was developed for the Office
Automation (OA) package to be run on the ULS. The resulting materials were
approved by a TC national task force and an interdepartmental Procurement
Review Committee prior to release to industry in March 1989.

    After a rigorous RFP process, 10 responses were finally received at
the deadline, on a Friday in September 1989. TC staff worked through the
weekend and faxed the astonished vendors barrages of written questions the
following Monday. TC then undertook a full qualification analysis,
including visits to nine vendor facilities in North America and Europe.
Sites were selected from TC groups, initial qualification and integration
tests were undertaken, and site assignments to the finally compliant
vendors were as follows: Vancouver/Finance (Unisys), Montreal/Airports
(AT&T), Moncton/Aviation (DEC), Dartmouth/ Marine (Bull) and Sydney/
Personnel (HP). All vendors were required to sign a memorandum of
agreement (MOA) with TC regarding their undertaking to integrate and
support their trial system.

    The OA RFP resulted in the qualification of an AT&T/Uniplex and a
Quadratron bid. Each hardware platform was assigned one of the two OA
packages, and Oracle also participated by providing a license for each
system. As the Moncton pretrial had shown, the system integration was a
non-trivial exercise; each ULS had to run OA and Oracle, emulate IBM
3174/3278 equipment and interface successfully with the SNA, interface to
a trial X.25 network linking the five trial sites to HQ, and tie in local
PCs.

    In one site there was an existing HP-3000 mini, which required a
special switch to permit users access either to it or to the ULS to be
installed there. A Generic System Integration Checklist (GSIC) was
developed to give vendors a clear idea of how TC would judge the
completeness of their SI effort; in one case a vendor was actually
disqualified for failure to integrate.

    After the vendors had integrated and made operational their systems, a
series of user and system administrator valuations, formal benchmarks and
vendor service, technology development and standards adherence assessments
were conducted over a seven-month period at the trial sites. During this
period, vendors were not permitted to upgrade the installed technology;
this provided a stable basis for evaluation against the QEC. TC
commissioned Aim Technologies to create a custom benchmark for the ULS
Field Trials, and all five vendors were certified as demonstrating
compliant performance.

    Vendors' original qualification ratings against each requirement were
modified as necessary based on actual experience. The Quadratron and
Uniplex products and Oracle relational database were also evaluated in
service. Each site commissioned an Oracle application to serve local
needs; these were produced largely by contractors under DGIMS oversight.
Also, users and system administrators were asked to rate the systems.

    In parallel with the system specification, acquisition and integration
phases, it was necessary to train and certify a Unit Level System
Administrator (ULSA) to operate and administer each local ULS
installation. These people had some computer experience, but came from an
administrative or support background; they were not computer systems
professionals.

    The ULS RFP contained many requirements aimed at making the
administration of the ULS as simple and easy as possible. TC has developed
a comprehensive ULSA Course, which will be delivered at the Transport
Canada Training Institute (TCTI) in Cornwall, Ontario. The course covers
ULS and ULSA role orientation, Unix, system administration, OA and Oracle
basic administration, LAN orientation and other subjects. Specifications
for an intelligent patch panel or System Integration Branch Exchange for
integration of the ULS with local- and wide-area networks were also
developed. A separate RFP was prepared for certification of system
integration service providers; TC would oversee integration activities,
but would not normally perform them in-house.

    Although time and resource constraints imposed some restrictions on
the portability testing, it was established that the GX POSIX approach
worked well and there was reasonable portability of applications and data.
As the trials have concluded, the five surviving vendors are each in the
final stages of negotiating their Departmental Individual Standing Offer
(DISO).

    Each TC midrange system acquisition will be competed for only among
the five DISO holders, on a price and availability basis. The compliant OA
vendors are also to receive DISOs.

    Funding cuts due to ongoing fiscal restraint have affected the planned
rate of ULS acquisition in the short term. However, TC official Mike
Plouffe, Director General Information Management Services, is confident
the program will be widely used as departmental plans stabilize and the
need for an increased distribution of processing power becomes paramount.

    There was, in strict principle, nothing that confined the GX concept
to Unix; it was thus decided to broaden the definition to potentially
include non-Unix OSes; any OS that can be modified to operate as per the
GX specification could in principle be declared compliant. To reflect this
move toward a more generalized definition of a system executive, as an
operating system is sometimes called, the term ``General Executive'' was
substituted for ``Greater Unix.'' It was also agreed to further evolve the
GX definition to consider key real-time requirements of various federal
agencies so as to ensure the broadest possible future applicability. A TB
Information Technology Standards working group has been formed for this
purpose.

Implementing OOP Designs -- Early Users Discover Promise, Pitfalls Of
Object-Oriented Programming

By  PHILIP J. GILL



    There's good news and bad news when it comes to early implementations
of object-oriented programming (OOP) designs.

    First, the good news. Early users appear pleased with the capabilities
of object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSes). OODBMSes, they
say, enable them to develop applications that support and manipulate new
data types, including images, graphics, video and audio information, in
ways traditional relational database management systems (RDBMSes) can't.
In these cases, users say they choose OOP tools and OODBMSes because their
applications demand them.

    Now the bad news. As much as users appear to like OODBMSes, they
appear to have doubts about C++, which is likely to emerge as a standard
OOP language in Unix and open systems because of its close association to
C. Some call C++ limited, some claim it isn't an OOP at all, others just
don't use it.

        Some users see an OODBMS as their only option. Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratories in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., purchased an OODBMS because it
had to. The non-profit private research foundation specializes in
molecular biology and genetics and related computer disciplines.
Scientists there are developing a molecular genetics research database
that will act as a central repository of information for the Human Genome
Program, a top scientific research priority of the Bush Administration.

    When completed, the database will map the molecular and protein
structures of human DNA, aiding biologists, doctors and others in
developing new treatments for diseases.

    ``The goal is to completely map the characteristics of the DNA of
humans to be able to develop molecular therapies,'' explains Tom Marr, a
senior staff investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Labs. Instead of treating
the visible symptoms of a disease, Marr explains, doctors will treat
molecules to cure disease.

    Marr says molecular biologists discover new aspects of DNA and protein
structure on a daily basis. New techniques such as polymerase chain
reactions (PCRs) unleash an enzyme that artificially amplifies and copies
DNA molecules, enabling scientists to unlock their structure.

    Though Marr uses Sybase's Sybase RDBMS for other applications, the
human genome project research database is being built using Servio Corp.'s
GemStone OODBMS on a Sun SPARCstation. It will run in a client/server
environment across an Ethernet/TCP/IP local-area network (LAN). When it is
completed, users will run the client portion of the database on Sun
SPARCstations, Apple Macintosh systems or DOS-based IBM-compatible PCs,
depending on their preferences.

    Marr says the limitations of an RDBMS' relational data model prohibit
its use in this application. For one thing, the information it will
contain is too dynamic.

    ``The technology is changing continuously,'' he says. ``This field
[molecular biology] is experimental technology right now.''

    Relational systems also can't handle the needed data types.

    ``A relational database stores DNA structure as text and proteins as
text,'' he says. An OODBMS can represent these structures in a graphical
way.

    One strike against the relational model, at least for this
application, is the separation of data and analysis. In an RDBMS,
management and analysis of data are independent of one another, he adds.
The user brings out data from a table, massages or updates it in some way,
then sends it back. But in this research database, the methods for
manipulating data and the data itself need to be closely integrated-a
standard feature in an OODBMS.

    The database is currently at the prototype stage. Both prototype and
production research databases will be written in SmallTalk, an
object-oriented programming language (OOP), instead of C++.

    Interact of New York is also an early user of Servio's GemStone
OODBMS. In this case, the New York-based firm's Integration Products
Division has used GemStone as the framework to integrate various
computer-aided engineering (CAE) applications, including electronic
design, logic simulations and chip and board design. Besides the GemStone
OODBMS, the framework includes Interact's CAE applications and a graphical
editor that let users integrate new, third-party CAE tools by adding a
common GUI.

    According to Gary Putlock, the division's group development leader,
the needs of the framework ruled out their using an RDBMS. ``We choose an
object-oriented database due to the nature of the problem,'' Putlock says.
``The types of data modeling that CAE design tools use don't work with
relational databases.''

    RDBMSes have other limits as well, says Putlock. In RDBMSes, the
database supports relationships and actions between data in fields, but it
does not contain descriptors of the data or allowed behaviors for that
data. OODBMSes, however, do.


OBJECT VS. OVERLAYS

       For some applications, an OODBMS may not be necessary at all. In
fact, an object-oriented overlay to an RDBMS may do just fine for many
applications, according to Dan Gerson, a member of the research staff at
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in Palo Alto.

    Gerson, who works in the collaborative systems area at PARC, is
developing a document database that will allow multiple users to work on
the same document and track multiple versions over a period of years.
Because the document database will contain large unstructured blocks of
text-the most common data type in an OODBMS today-an OODBMS would seem a
natural fit. But Gerson says he's not so sure.

    Gerson, who currently uses a Sybase RDBMS running on a network of Sun
SPARCstation 1s and Sun-4 SPARCservers, recently began to investigate
whether it would be better to develop his document database using an
OODBMS, in particular, ObjectStore from Object Design, Burlington, Mass.

    OODBMSes offer potential performance improvements over RDBMSes, using
pointers to locate objects in the database. Pointers in relational systems
are known to be slower, so an OODBMS should offer better response time.

    But OODBMSes have their drawbacks as well. ``Currently, OODBMSes are
not very well developed,'' he says.

    ``The basic problem in an OODBMS is in the user I/O inside of a
transaction,'' Gerson adds. ``Programs in an RDBMS have a looser
connection to data. Users issue an SQL query, the data base gets a table,
makes a copy of it, and the user looks at it on his screen.''

    During a transaction in an OODBMS, objects are loaded into memory,
either real or virtual. ``As soon as you execute a transaction, you can't
see the object anymore,'' he says. ``In an RDBMS, the system is giving you
some sort of a copy. In an OODBMS, the system is giving you the actual
object, so they're only valid in a transaction.''

    Gerson says he believes few people are aware of this fundamental flaw
in OODBMS technology because so few systems are out there. Those that are,
function as single-user, workstation-based development systems, not
multiuser systems where deadlocks can occur. Besides, he says, he thinks
some OODBMS vendors are either unaware of the possible problem or
deliberately ignoring it.


THE TROUBLE WITH C++

        Users may debate the necessity of OODBMSes, but one thing they all
agree on is that C++, something of an emerging standard in OOP languages
for Unix systems, is something less than they had in mind.

    Software engineers at Teknekron Communications Systems of Berkeley,
Calif., use OOP languages to develop custom network management software
for wide-area network (WAN) vendors. Customers include service providers,
such as the phone companies, and manufacturers of modems, muxes,
multiplexers and other WAN hardware. Typical programs contain 200,000 to
300,000 lines of code and as many as 300 classes of objects in the
hierarchy. Teknekron programmer/developers use a network of 180 to 200 Sun
RISC-based SPARCstations running the SunOS, X-Window and the Motif
graphical user interface (GUI). In the past, most of the code was written
using C-Flavors, a C library that generates a LISP Flavors subset. A few
months ago, Teknekron engineers switched to Saber-C++.

    ``Our customers prefer C++ as the language to use,'' says Peter Ohler,
senior engineer, explaining the move from C-Flavors.

    Ohler says he's ambivalent about the switch.

    C++ does strong type checking before compiling a completed program to
check for bugs. That's good, says Ohler, but it's also bad, as it provides
no way in C++ to foil the strong type checking mechanism. That limits what
Ohler calls the ``genericity'' of object classes. Once an object has been
created, he says, the functionality of that object can't be used in any
other class types other than those with inheritance from the original
object.

    ``The class may be unrelated, but you might want to use the same
functionality,'' he says.``That's not possible. You can't drag the line of
inheritance.''

    Two alternatives exist. The most practical, says Ohler, is to do what
his technical team does: They write some code in standard C to get around
the strong type checking. The other is to create hundreds and hundreds of
classes to prepare for any programming contingency, an untenable option.

    SmallTalk, the earliest object-oriented programming language, doesn't
have this restriction, notes Ohler. But, he says, strong momentum is
building up for C++ despite its limitations because of its close
relationship with C and open systems standards in general.

    ``We have a saying around here that C++ is a better C language, but
it's not an object-oriented language,'' adds Ohler. ``There's no
fundamental OOP model or paradigm. It's a non-intuitive and inconsistent
language.''

    Marr of Cold Spring Labs says he prefers not to use C++.  All the
development work for the molecular structure research database is done in
SmallTalk. ``A lot of it is personal taste,'' Marr explains. ``C++ does a
lot of things with multiple inheritance I don't like.''

    Xerox PARC's Gerson also believes there are problems with the C++
language. For one thing, he says, it does not support full data
abstractions.

    ``Let's just say that C++ gives you object-oriented structures,'' he
says. But, he says, there is a solution. ``Adding a preprocessor will take
care of many of the problems with C++.''

Judging OODBMS Performance

    Much has been written about the performance of relational database
management systems (RDBMSes), but many users know little about how to
judge the performance of an object-oriented database management system
(OODBMS).

    There are a number of ways to judge OODBMS performance, some of which
are similar to an RDBMS, some of which are not, according to Gary Putlock,
group leader of development for the integration products division of
Interact, a New York City software developer.

    ``There's raw access performance, which can be equivalent to a
relational system,'' he says. Just as with relational systems, users can
judge OODBMS performance in response and data access times, says Putlock.

    ``Other aspects of performance correspond to flexibility,'' he
continues. ``How well does it perform in a multiuser situation?''

    Putlock says this remains an important question, as some vendors have
implemented their OODBMS products for single-user workstation
environments, not as a multiuser, network server.

    Another question to ask, says Putlock, is whether or not the OODBMS is
not just a single-user system, but can function in a distributed,
heterogeneous network environment.

    Putlock says Interact chose GemStone as the base for the framework
because it supports multiple hardware platforms. Interact's The Integrator
CAE framework, developed on top of the GemStone OODBMS, runs on Sun-3s and
SPARCstation 1s as well as IBM RISC System/6000 workstations in an
Ethernet/TCP/IP local-area network (LAN) environment.

    Putlock adds that users should also concern themselves with a
prospective vendor's stability, the richness of the OODBMS' development
environment, product reliability and support.

E&S Gets IDC Tool

By LEE BRUNO



    Salt Lake City-Evans & Sutherland Computer has signed a strategic
joint marketing and development agreement with Image Data Corp. (IDC) of
Pasadena, Calif., to port Image Data's imaging technology to its graphics
workstations.

    The agreement will allow E&S hardware to be sold with IDC software
products. Specifically, 2-D imaging software, which is a part of IDC's
Para/Series application software, will be bundled with Evans &
Sutherland's ESV workstations, the company said.

    With the agreement in place, Evans & Sutherland said that it plans to
increase its ability to address the general visualization market by
including imaging and graphics technology in each workstation. The company
said it can now cost-effectively bundle the image and graphics technology
because of the declining cost of memory and the increase in processing
power.

INDUSTRY WATCH

By  JOHN CHISHOLM



With IBM's loss of more than $1 billion last quarter, due at the root to
the erosion of market share of proprietary MVS to Unix, the Apple
Macintosh is now the last major proprietary system to maintain sales
momentum. The Macintosh is indeed closed: MacOS, A/UX and their
applications run only on Macs from Apple Computer; and Macs run MacOS and
A/UX and no other operating systems. MacOS applications cannot readily be
ported from Unix or DOS/Windows, and vice versa. How much longer the Mac's
momentum will last is impossible to tell, but being closed does not help.

    To be fair, Mac has a strong, loyal installed base and is today
gaining low-end market share with its Macintosh Classic. But Mac overall
is being overtaken by Microsoft Windows 3.0, whose development and
promotion is supported by dozens of hardware vendors; and by Intel
platforms, with their wide choice of systems software and strong
price/performance due to competition among many vendors. The very closed
strategy that insulates Macintosh from competition today will hurt it
tomorrow. To be successful in the mid1990s and beyond, Apple must play the
same game and subject itself to the same market forces as its PC and
systems software competitors.

    That means licensing to other vendors MacOS and the MacROMS, the
proprietary heart of the Mac. Doing so creates Mac competitors, but ones
from whom Apple earns revenue in licensing fees. It also creates
complementary Macs-notebooks, servers, fault-tolerant systems-which
increase the size of the Mac market. Setting license fees is tricky: too
low and the licensees are all-too-plentiful competitors; too high and
they're unsuccessful customers. The best way for Apple to manage these
conflicting objectives is to do as the Compaq-Microsoft combination does
and as Sun is beginning to do: split into separate hardware and software
profit centers and let each contend with its own competitors.

    To compete as an open systems supplier, Apple will also need the
price/performance of RISC. SPARC would make Mac a Sun clone; Mips, an ACE
(Compaq/DEC) clone. Given the choice of being qualitatively different from
or merely quantitatively better than SPARC or ACE, Apple has the customer
base, brand-name following and product differentiation to be different.
This makes the 88000 the best available RISC choice for future Mac
workstations and servers, in my view. The 88K's primary fault, accounting
for its distant third place in RISC market share after SPARC and Mips, is
not the CPU itself, but lateness to market in 1988 and lack of multiple
sources. Lateness to market then doesn't much hurt Apple today, and Apple
should be able to negotiate with Motorola for multiple sources.

    Assuming Apple adopts the 88K, should it join the 88open Consortium
and comply with its compatibility standards? That would help 88open, whose
members are all second-tier players-DG, Unisys, Omron, Encore,
Harris-trying to win sales by being compatible with each other. Like the
Eastern Bloc countries, they are trying to prosper by trading among
themselves when what they really need is a major power to join them. Apple
would be that major power, as Sun is to SPARC and Compaq hopes to be to
ACE.

    Supporting 88open could also help Apple. True, the five hundred or so
88open-compliant applications pale in comparison to the number currently
available for the Mac. But Apple would gain multivendor compatibility and
a strong claim to ``openness'' with a group of companies that not only do
not threaten Apple but that would be happy to let Apple lead them. Unix
System V.4 with the Mac GUI and MacOS API could well become a new 88open
standard.

NIST Unveils Graphics Test Suite

By  LEE BRUNO



    Chicago-The National Institutes of Standards and Technology has
unveiled a computer graphics test suite aimed at protecting users and
ensuring that vendors' hardware platforms and applications conform to a
standard way of exchanging picture information.


    The validation test suite is based upon the ANSI/ISO standard data
interchange format, called the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM). The CGM
is a standard file format and represents a graphical snapshot of a final
screen image.

    Essentially, the CGM test ensures that graphical picture information
conforms to the CGM standard and can be exchanged between different
hardware platforms and software systems. NIST said the aim of the test
suites is to ensure that graphical picture information can be ported to
different graphical devices.

    The CGM testing suite consists of three components: a generator that
produces the file; the CGM file; and a CGM interpreter, which is capable
of reading the CGM file. NIST said the CGM interpreter and generator test
suites are currently under development.

    NIST said it developed the validation test suites because vendors were
using different CGM formats that did not permit users to exchange
graphical files. The incompatibility arose, NIST said, because the
semantic specification within CGM was ambiguous. Within the CGM standard
test suite, there are three encodings of the metafile syntax that include
binary, character and clear text characteristics. The CGM standard has
been adopted for federal use in the Federal Information Processing
Standard, or FIPS.

    The purpose of making the CGM test files available is so vendors can
determine if their products conform to the federal standards required by
government departments and agencies purchasing computer equipment.

    Upon completion of the test, a report is generated that summarizes the
testing procedures and results for the CGM. The report provides a list of
tests performed and errors found. In addition, the test identifies whether
the CGM met the conformance testing of the CGM standard.

    The Computer Systems Laboratory of the NIST said a Unix-based CGM
should be in 1/4-inch tape format to be tested. The CGM test for one to
five metafiles costs $800 and includes the CTS/Metacheck license. With a
CTS/Metacheck license, the cost is $500 for testing one to five metafiles.
For additional information about NIST's CGM test service, call
301-975-3365.

Sun Reports Higher Profits

    San Francisco-Sun Microsystems recently announced that profits for its
third quarter increased a total of 59 percent over the similar period last
year. The figures were far in excess of industry analysts' estimates.

    Sun reported earnings of $58.7 million, or 56 cents a share, for its
third quarter ending on March 29. Its earnings for the same period last
year were recorded at $36.7 million, or 40 cents a share. Sun also said it
shipped a record 48,000 units this quarter, with sales to the commercial
sector accounting for approximately 30 percent of its revenues.

    In a prepared statement, William J. Raduchel, Sun vice president and
chief financial officer, said that the quarter ended with a ``record
backlog of orders, almost $700 million in cash and a financial sheet
that's never been stronger.''

Baan Licenses Triton

    Holland's Baan Info Systems plans to step up worldwide sales of its
Triton Unix-based manufacturing software through licensing agreements it
recently signed with five hardware vendors, said Adrian Neele, the
company's general manager for North American operations.

    Most recently, Baan Info Systems signed a joint marketing agreement
with NCR, under which each of the two companies will sell NCR's System
3000 computers bundled with Baan's software. Baan will pay $1.5 million to
NCR over the next 18 months under the agreement. Baan has signed similar
joint marketing agreements with Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Digital Equipment
and Bull, according to Neele.

    ``Hardware vendors are pushing hard on us because we're well
established,'' Neele said. ``It's not easy finding a Unix software company
with 10 years in the field.''

    Baan has been selling its products in Europe for a decade and in the
Far East for five years, according to Neele.

    Baan's product line includes Triton-Industry, which supports
manufacturing operations such as routing, planning, shop floor control as
well as group technology; Triton-Trade, which is a stock purchase and
sales control program that optimizes the flow of goods through a company;
and Triton-Finance, which helps to automate administration and accounting.

Legislating Computer Conduct

    It is not uncommon today for our society to be described as litigious.

    The popular-and justified-rationale for that accusation is that people
are using judges, attorneys, lay juries and millions of taxpayer dollars
to settle business disputes that could much more easily and intelligently
be settled otherwise.

    Not only are many such lawsuits premature, but they are sometimes
downright inappropriate. There are some disciplines where the disputes can
be of such a technical and complicated nature that it is almost impossible
for lay juries to sort out fact from fiction, or to evaluate which party
in a given conflict is acting more unfairly.

    Today, the computer industry is just such an entity. As technology
changes, as high-speed workstations put the power of international
networks at the fingertips of an insurance company executive or a
pharmaceutical chemist or a department store's head of inventory, the
rules governing computer conduct are going to have to change.

    Two recent events make it clear how the current legal system is
ill-equipped at the moment to craft the changes that society needs:

    o  Attorneys for Robert Morris decided last week to ask the Supreme
Court to overturn the federal appellate panel's ruling upholding Morris'
conviction for unleashing the 1988 Internet Worm.

    o  Steve Jackson Games, a games and publishing company that had much
of its computer equipment and some unpublished manuscripts seized last
year by the Secret Service during its anti-cracker sweep Operation Sun
Devil, has sued the Secret Service and the U.S. Justice Department. Not
only was Jackson's company never accused of a crime, but, the lawsuit
contends, it was never even suspected of wrongdoing.

    The Morris appeal hung on a definition of access to a computer
network, a question made complex because Morris already had accounts on
several legitimate systems in the network. But with their attempts to
comprehend finger daemon, sendmail and worm, the jury-based on juror
comments after the trial-didn't even try to wrestle with that issue. The
judge who presided over the trial opted to not even explain the concept-a
major element of the defense's case-to the jury because he didn't want to
cloud the issue. There was substantial question whether the judge himself
understood the argument.

    The Steve Jackson Games case is probably the most frightening of all.
In that case, we have the Secret Service candidly saying that this is such
a new area of the law that they had very little idea how to pursue an
investigation. Their approach was to conduct search warrants on many
locations, seize everything that could possibly be computer-related and-in
the ensuing months-figure out if they had come upon anything.

    As computer technology reaches farther and farther out into
non-computer-literate society, society is going to insist on it being
controlled by some authorities. Today, those authorities often do not
understand the technologies they are now being told to supervise.

    If users want their high-technology activities regulated by those who
understand the intent of their efforts, then it is urgent that the
computer industry establish its own method of regulating security.
Otherwise, it will be done for us.

Benchmarks Key To Making The Right Deal

By  M. ANDREW BARLOW



    The standard benchmark in today's workstation market is a powerful
tool when the customer knows how the benchmark relates to the workload of
the application. If the customer does not know this, it can lead to
confusion and the wrong buying decision.

    The standard benchmark is critical to the buying process, for it can
be used to narrow the playing field of possible workstation alternatives
(and get through Door No. 1 of a sales process). If possible, however,
final buying decisions should be made based on the results of Door No.
2-tests that reflect the primary or heaviest use of the system. These
tests should include evaluations of application performance,
interoperability, the operating system and system reliability.

    The most common benchmarks in use today are MIPS, MFLOPS and, most
recently, SPECmarks. Each of these benchmarks measure a portion of the
system's total performance. MIPS measures CPU integer performance, MFLOPS
measures CPU floating performance and SPECmarks measure integer,
floating-point and cache performance. A strong showing on these benchmarks
can be a good indication of a system's performance. The challenge for
customers is to understand how a specific benchmark can help indicate how
their application will perform on a given hardware platform.

Graphics, I/O and networking may also be bottlenecks and therefore may
require other benchmarks because they are often measured using different
parameters by each vendor. To date, no one has developed one benchmark
that measures all these factors to predict total application performance.

    Other considerations usually need to be taken into account before the
final buying decision is made. These are the considerations behind Door
No. 2. The most important is the application that will be run. An
application will put a unique stress on the system. Capturing a typical
workload and running that workload on the system of interest can be the
most important step in understanding how the workstation will perform.
Benchmarking at this stage is a far more expensive task and is not easily
standardized.

    Due to the complexity of measuring system interoperability, a
benchmark for this has not yet been developed. The same applies to
operating systems. A customer typically buys one application, but has many
kinds of workstations.

    Finally, system reliability is critical. A system that is down for
even a few minutes will quickly lose any gains reflected in a particular
benchmark.

    Improvements in standard benchmarks continue to be made. SPECmarks,
for instance, have gone a long way toward improving the measurability of
overall system performance. The SPECmark, however, typically is quoted as
one number, when in reality it consists of a suite of 10 tests. The
results of these individual tests can be very helpful in predicting future
application performance. The GPC graphics benchmark is another good
example of a standard benchmark.

    Finally, some vendors are developing measurement tools to help
customers better understand how their application stresses the system.
Information gained from the use of these tools will add more value to the
benchmark and lower the cost of making a buying decision. Perhaps, with
more support for committees such as SPEC, a buying decision can be made
solely on the results of one benchmark.

Architect Draws On RS/6000's Resources To Reconstruct Lost Abbey

    Reaching into the past has always been the domain of science fiction.
But imagination, with the help of computers, can sometimes achieve
analogous results.

    Such was the case recently in France, where architect Philippe Lorimy
used an IBM RS/6000 with computer aided-design software to reconstruct the
lost Benedictine Abbey of St. Guilhem-le-Desert. The abbey, located 18
miles from Montpellier on the southern coast of France, was an important
stopover for the various religious pilgrimages that wound their way from
Spain into France.

    The 3-D computer models provided Lorimy with drawings that were
finished by hand, filling out the details and contours of the time. ``If I
had to draw these totally by hand, I'd never have been able to do it
because it would have been so time-consuming,'' Lorimy said. As it was,
the designs took approximately 10 days to finish.

    The abbey and the nearby Church of Gellone, first erected in 804 A.D.,
were rebuilt or modified in the 11th and 12th centuries after being
damaged in France's religious wars and the French Revolution.

    Lorimy's various drawings are due to be published in a book titled St.
Guilhem-le-Desert: The Sculpture of the Cloister of Gellone.

It's A Scientific Fact: This Flock Of Gray Eagles Loves A Good
Party

    Americans don't usually like to call attention to their age,
especially if it exceeds 29. But a group of graying computer executives
who call themselves the Gray Eagles is proving there is an exception to
every rule.

    No, this isn't a militant new division of the Gray Panthers working on
behalf of senior citizens, but a group of Data General alumni with roots
to DG in the mid-'70s and a great deal of entrepreneurial spirit.

    Members of this group have played key roles in such companies as
Apollo Computer, Convex Computer, Stratus Computer, Alliant, Lotus
Development, Access Technology and Mips Computer Systems. Twenty-seven
Gray Eagles work at Mips alone, including Bob Miller, chairman and chief
executive officer, and Chuck Boesenberg, president and chief operating
officer. One Gray Eagle at Mips prefers to call the Mips group the Gray
Teenage Mutant Ninja Eagles.

    So, what do all of these Gray Eagles do?  They all meet once a year at
Comdex in Las Vegas for a national get-together, network among themselves
throughout the year and, most importantly, throw parties on a regular
basis. Not a bad way to age.

Striking A Blow For Accuracy: Did Early Koreans Find The Key To Software
Quality?

By MITCH WAGNER



    Software engineer Martin Minow writes in the on-line RISKS-FORUM
Digest:

    Is it possible that the solution to the software quality crisis was
discovered in Korea in the 15th century? The following is from Daniel J.
Boorstin's The Discoverers, quoting, apparently, Kim Won-Yong, ``Early
Movable Type in Korea'' (1954):

        ``The supervisor and compositor shall be flogged 30 times for an
error per chapter; the printer shall be flogged 30 times for bad
impression, either too dark or too light, of one character per chapter.''

     Boorstin continues, ``This helps explain both the reputation for
accuracy earned by the earliest Korean imprints and the difficulty that
Koreans found in recruiting printers.''

    The RISKS-FORUM Digest is an on-line newsletter that is available over
the Internet through anonymous ftp, and over USENET as comp.risks.

Profits Translate To Lots-O'-Pizza At Data General

By  EVAN SCHUMAN



    Ever have one of those days when the boss dumps this impossible
project into your lap at the last minute, and then tells you that he knew
about it a week ago but kept it from you ``as a matter of policy?''

    Pantelis Venetis knows that feeling well.

    Venetis owns the small pizzeria at the corporate headquarters for Data
General in Westboro, Mass. A few minutes after 4 p.m. on Wednesday, April
24, Venetis-who says he normally makes about 80 pizzas a day-was told that
he had until the next morning to create 1,800 pizzas for a DG pizza party
feeding 2,463 employees.

    ``I tell them, `Impossible,' '' Venetis said, his voice smothered in a
thick Greek accent. ``They say I gotta do my best. I got a little
nervous.''

    DG officials wanted the bash to celebrate the second consecutive
profitable quarter for the struggling computer company, good news that
executives attribute partly to DG's powerful AViiON line, which uses a
pizza box-shaped CPU.

    Those officials maintained that they could not tell Venetis about the
planned pizza bash one minute before the stock market's 4 p.m. close
because of the possibility that the 13-year DG employee might
inadvertently leak the news.

    Venetis said that when he got out of the meeting that afternoon, his
crew had already gone home. So he called his wife and told her to
immediately get 10 pounds of yeast-somehow.

    Firing up the store's two ovens, Venetis and another employee worked
through midnight making enough dough for 1,200 pizzas. After catching a
few hours' sleep, he returned to DG at 3 a.m. and-with an eight-person
crew-continued the pizza preparation with an eye toward cooking beginning
at 7 a.m.

    But, Venetis told his bosses, he was not going to make 1,800 by the
morning. No way.

    It was then that the telephone rang for Scott Whitman, the store
manager for the Southborough restaurant of Domino's Pizza. It was a DG
official asking for a delivery of 150 pizzas by 11:15 a.m. and an
additional 100 pies at noon. The order was later increased to 275.

    ``He was a little stunned at that point,'' said Randy Soper, the
franchise area supervisor for Domino's. ``On an average Thursday, he could
have expected orders for maybe 65 or 70'' pizzas.

    But splitting the order between stores in Southborough and Framingham
made the job doable, said Soper, who spent much of that next morning
kneading dough.

    ``We were just cranking out pies. One guy slapping them down and one
guy saucing,'' he said. ``It was conveyor-belt pizza-making at its best.
This is the largest single order that our company has ever had'' in
Massachusetts.

    When they delivered the order, they found themselves greeted with no
tips (So THAT's how they are now profitable!) and a DG manager who stared
at his watch and wanted the $3 off because they didn't make it in 30
minutes.

    ``We don't have our guarantee over 10 pizzas,'' Soper said, adding
that he told the DG manager that he was willing to make an exception for
DG. ``I volunteered to give him $3 off the whole order'' costing ``a
little more than $1,700.''

    To make matters easier for the Domino's crew, toppings were avoided
and all 275 large pizzas were just plain cheese. Venetis' batch included
600 pepperoni and 300 mushroom pies.

    Ironically, this job might have been easier for Venetis two years ago
before major DG layoffs dwindled the number of workers at headquarters.how
would it have been easier? The irony is that those layoffs are the main
reason for DG's current profitability. ``A year ago, we used to make 200
pizzas a day,'' he said.

    When the 22-year-veteran pizza man was asked how the pizzas tasted
after all the insanity died down, he laughed. ``I didn't taste any of
them. After you make 1,000 pizzas, how can you be able to eat them?''
