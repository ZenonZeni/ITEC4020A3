<FONT SIZE=4><B>Who is Greater Union?</B> </FONT><BR>



Greater Union is a division of the Australian Company - Amalgamated Holdings
Limited. The group operates some 240 cinema screens and is the largest cinema
group in Australia. In addition to its cinemas Greater Union also operates 'Birch
Carroll & Coyle' cinemas in Queensland, Northern NSW and the Northern
Territory, 'Fun and Games' family amusement centres, 'Kidsports' educational
and recreational centres and has substantial investments in the Village Roadshow
group of companies.<P>


<FONT SIZE=4><B>What is Digital Sound?</B></FONT><BR>


Using the same digital technology as Compact Disks, Digital Soundtracks on
motion pictures produce clearer sounds and allow up to eight dedicated sound
channels. This enables special sound effects to come from different directions
within the cinema. Greater Union were the first cinema group to introduce digital
sound systems to Australia. There are three types of digital sound systems in use
today DTS (digital theatre systems), Dolby Digital and Sony Digital. Both the
Dolby and Sony systems store the digital information on the film which is read by
a laser, while the DTS utilizes a time code on the film which plays a separate CD
ROM containing the soundtrack.<P>





<FONT SIZE=4><B>How do I win a FREE ticket at the cinema?</B></FONT><BR>


Every five minutes the Greater Union computer ticketing system selects a lucky
movie goer somewhere in Australia and issues a WINNER ticket. This ticket
entitles you to see your next movie at a Greater Union cinema for free. So choose
a Greater Union cinema for your next movie and good luck!<P>


<FONT SIZE=4><B>What does NO FREE LIST mean?</B></FONT><BR>


When you are lucky enough to score a free ticket either through the computer
ticketing system or another Greater Union promotion check to make sure the
movie you want to see is not advertised as NO FREE LIST.
This means that unfortunately we cannot accept any free tickets for this particular
movie until the NO FREE LIST is taken off (generally after two weeks of
screenings).</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
