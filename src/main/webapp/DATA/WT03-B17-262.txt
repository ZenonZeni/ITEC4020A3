Here is a simple case of  no one taking responsibility for these trees.
Take care of the trees as you would take care of yourself......

     You pegged it right.  I am in Connor Estates.  And, as you  have
noted, many of the Sycamore trees are `stressing out'.  Connors, recently
having come under new ownership, is undergoing many changes.
 The landscape is just one of the areas needing immediate attention.
 The trees, nurtured properly, have grown considerably and are just
beginning to provide the greatly needed shade during the hot hot summer
 months.  We do not want to lose these trees.
     I refrained from replying to both your e-mails anticipating the
radio program Saturday morning on KVML-AM 1450 at 10:00 a.m.
 What a delite!
     We want to thank you both for all the information provided, both
in the e-mails and the radio program.  I took the liberty of recording the
conversation held with Andrew Lopez, typed up a summary of sorts and
have distributed copies to some of the interested residents in the area.  We
know that they too are very concerned about the beautiful Sycamore
trees. I hope that this will help to bring attention to your fine radio
program, Jim, and the information store-house provided by Andrew Lopez, the
Invisible Gardener.  Thank you both so very much.

P.S.  I probably will be e-mailing you for more help in the future.  As
observed, we do reside in some really rocky areas.  Regardless, most of
us are trying to cultivate, not just trees, but other plants and
vegetables too.  And I might add, we've enjoyed some successes.
Thanks again.

E-mail from Jim Bergantz - First `In the Garden' listener  to respond
wins lifetime membership to Andy's Club.  Hey can't turn this kind of deal
down.

Hoping to be a winner!

We're retired, transplanted Southern Californians (40 + years, last 20
in Huntington Beach).  Always had a garden of sorts.  Grew great veggies
in our back yard (instead of lawn).  Growing anything up here in the rocks
is different to say the least.  Must confess been pesticide users but
organic influences slowly intruding our lives.  Will keep in touch.

Congrads! Your book and membership number is on its way to you!
This gives you free lifetime membership in IGof A. See IGA info
page  <A HREF = th01002.htm>About The Invisible Gardeners of America / Joining</A> or  <A HREF = th01000.htm>Who we are</A>
for more info on what benefits your getting. Please email back to me if your also
interested in using The Online Organic InfoBank for help with your tree problem.
Plus as a new member, you get a free online class. May I suggest a tree care?
We can do your trees in question?

>hello Geno!

normally I wouldn't have the time to answer your question directly( I
am also posting this answer in the trees dept on my web site, you might
want to check it out) but I also love trees and will do anything to
help them....

the answer is simple...feed them! I know I know..feed the there are
lots of trees to feed! then fed them what? well the best way to help
the tree rid themselves of disease and pests. Stress out trees get
attacked by these things!
so..what to feed them thats cost effective? Rock Dust! See rock dust
dept, also see reminearth folks in the rock dust dept. As to where you
can get rock dust in your area, the reminearth folks will know!....to
write to them go to their dept in my web site and click on email!
reminearth@aol.com tell em andy sent ya!
dust areas under trees with rock dust.. 1 50lb bag will take care of
about 10 trees!(5 lbs per tree) dust before rains....
yours
