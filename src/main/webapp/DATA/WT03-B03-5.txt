Liberia 
[DOCUMENT] Harassment of Journalists Intensifies 

Africa News Service 
January 15, 1996 (19960115)
 
   New York - Text of several recent news alerts by the New York-based 
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). 
   On 12 January 1996, Stanton Peabody, acting managing director of the 
"Daily Observer", was released after Press Union of Liberia attorneys, 
through the Justice & Peace Commission, filed a bill of habeus corpus on 
his behalf. Peabody was released on bail of $20,000 Liberian (US$ 400). 
   Peabody will return to court on 16 January, as will editor-in- chief 
of the "Daily Observer" James Seitua. However, the two journalists will 
be tried separately on charges of "criminal malevolence." 
   Immediately after the court ordered Peabody's release, Director of 
National Police Joseph Tate ordered seven police officers to re-arrest 
him in the courthouse. However, the presiding judge announced that any 
re-arrest would place Tate in contempt of court. Peabody plans to remain 
at home until the upcoming court date.
   On 11 January 1996, representatives of the Press Union of Liberia and 
the management of the "Daily Observer" obtained a bill of release for 
James Seitua, editor-in-chief of the "Daily Observer". Bail in the 
amount of $25,000 Liberian dollars ($350 US) was paid. Under the 
conditions of his release, Seitua cannot travel outside of Monrovia, and 
must report daily to the police until the matter is resolved.
   The charge against Seitua, as stated in his bill of release, is 
"criminal malevolence." No charges have been filed against him in a 
court of law. On 29 December 1995, the "Daily Observer" published an 
article that disputed the claim made by United Revolutionary Front of 
Sierra Leone spokesperson Eddie Hebron that he was interviewed in the 
Ivory Coast by the British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of 
America. The article claimed that Hebron was in Monrovia, the Liberian 
capital, during the interviews. James Seitua was subsequently arrested 
on 9 January and detained; he has since been released on bail. Stanton 
Peabody, in an attempt to intervene on Seitua's behalf, was also 
arrested on 10 January. He remains in detention.
   On 8 January 1996, D. Sompon Weah II, reporter for "The News", and 
"The News" photographer Pewee S. Flomoku were attacked in Po River 
(northwestern Liberia), where they were covering skirmishes between West 
Africa peacekeeping forces (ECOMOG) and warring factions of the United 
Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J).
   The attack occurred shortly after their arrival, as they were 
recording the state of security in the region. At the directive of the 
executive director of the Liberia Refugees Repatriation & Resettlement 
Commission, Mrs. Weade Kobbah Wreh, they were beaten by her personal 
bodyguards and some ECOMOG soldiers. Flomoku's camera was destroyed.

Nigeria
[DOCUMENT] Press Group Condemns Attacks on Press 

Africa News Service
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   New York - Statement by the New York-based Committee to Protect 
Journalists.
  The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan advocate of 
press freedom, condemns the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor 
in chief of best-selling Lagos-based "Tell" magazine, and the recent 
escalation of attacks against Nigeria's independent press. 
   Igiebor, the recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 
1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at 
his home in Lagos. SSS agents also confiscated 20,000 copies of "Tell" 
magazine's Christmas Day edition with the cover story "Abacha is 
Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition." On December 27, SSS agents made a 
failed attempt to search his office for the company's tax records and 
staff pay records.
   Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement without 
charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for articles 
published in Tell criticizing the military government. During 
interrogations at Lagos State Command of the SSS facility in Shangisha, 
Igiebor repeatedly stated that he receives financial support from 
neither outsiders nor Nigerian citizens, and that any information he 
receives arrives by mail. 
   CPJ also denounces the following attacks against the independent 
press during the last two weeks of 1995:
   * On December 31, the office of the magazine division of the 
Independent Communications Network Limited, publishers of "The News," 
"Tempo," and "Tempofootball," was torched by arsonists using a petrol 
bomb. According to Dapo Olorunyomi, editor -in-chief of "The News," the 
fire destroyed property (including a new line of Gateway 2000 Pentium 
computers) worth millions of naira. The arsonists managed to escape.
   The office, located on the first floor of Tejumola House in Ikeja, 
Lagos, houses the newsroom and production center of the three magazines. 
It was the only floor of the four-story building that was torched. 
Management expects publication of The News and Tempo to be suspended for 
approximately two weeks.
    On December 19, photojournalists Peter Obe, Bayo Ewuoso, Abiodun 
Ajala and Segun Olakitan were assaulted and detained by police during 
the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) rally in Lagos. Their offense 
was photographing the confrontation between NADECO supporters and the 
over five hundred policemen who shot tear gas into the crowd to disperse 
the protesters. 
   Ewuoso, a senior photojournalist with "AM News" was severely beaten 
by over ten policemen who later transported him to the Surulere Police 
Station for interrogation. Ajala of "This Day" newspaper, Olakitan of 
"Tell" magazine, and veteran photojournalist Obe were also beaten and 
seriously injured by police. Ajala and Olakitan were rushed to a nearby 
hospital for treatment.
   On December 16, ten security operatives lay siege to the "AM News" 
office, demanding to know the whereabouts of editor-in-chief Bayo 
Onanuga. They were seeking Onanuga to place him under arrest. Onanuga 
remains in hiding. The security operatives reportedly did the same at 
the offices of "Tell" magazine. 
   On December 16, all 55,000 copies of "Tell" were seized at the 
printing house. The seizure followed the magazine's publication of an 
article titled "The Release of [Chief Moshood] Abiola: The World Waits 
On [General Sani] Abacha." 
   On December 15, arsonists torched the circulation department of "The 
Guardian" newspaper. Damage was minimal because the fire was quickly 
brought under control.
   On December 15, Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi 
Isaac, reporters and contributors to the paper, were held for 
questioning by Lagos police.
   Finally, CPJ intensified its call for the release of the four 
journalists (Christine Anyanwu, George Mbah, Ben Charles Obi and Kunle 
Ajibade) who were convicted to fifteen years in jail for their alleged 
participation in an alleged coup plot against the military regime.

Uganda
UK Report Predicts Museveni Win In '96 Polls

The Monitor (Kampala)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Gerald Owachi

   Kampala - A report issued by the authoritative London-based Economist 
Intelligence Unit (EIU) has predicted a Museveni victory in the forthcoming 
presidential elections.
   "It will be very surprising if President Yoweri Museveni, is not returned 
to office next April as the elected president,: the just released 1995 4th 
quarter country report, says.
   The report, however, doubts whether all sections of society will accept the 
legitimacy of his election.
   At the same time it casts a shadow over the loyalty of the army towards any 
other person other than Museveni. "The army remains Mr. Museveni's trump 
card," it states, therefore disqualifying the possibilities of the army 
supporting any other democratically elected government.
   It also suggests that the legislative elections in May 1996 will produce a 
better political balance in parliament, and thereby defuse some political 
tension.
   According to the report, NRM is already confident of victories in Karamoja 
-- because NRM has allowed the K'jongs to keep their guns. Busoga--VP 
Kazibwe's home area, Bugisu, Kapchorwa and his traditional base the South-
west.
   The report further states that, "Mr Museveni is even trying to tempt former 
president, Idi Amin, back to Uganda in order to capitalise on his support in 
the North West.
   The EIU report which briefly portrays the current political and economic 
state of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, cites the new constitution and the 
escalating military expenditure of the Uganda government as a possible source 
of disagreement between the donor community and the Government.
   According to the report, "the USA clearly believes that a five-year wait 
before the issue of multi-partyism can again be tested is too long. It adds 
that European countries previously reluctant to show their resentment on the 
matter, have now formally joined the US in pressing for an early 
constitutional amendment.
   "The government reduced the defence share of budget expenditure from 36% in 
1990/91 to 13% in 1991/92, but then raised it again during the following two 
years and brought it up to 30% this year [1995}," the reports notes. The donor 
community is not at all happy with this trend regardless of the insecurity in 
the north and along the Sudan border.
   The report says that the rift between president Moi of Kenya and Museveni 
which used to be portrayed as a largely personal matter, has developed into "a 
more substantial rift based on the different approaches to systems of 
government." It blames the failure to achieve regional cooperation on this cat 
and mouse relationship between these two leaders.
   The strike by medical workers last September is cited in the report as a 
possible beginning of demands to be floated by the public sector workers. 
This, the report goes on, would result into an inflationary wage spiral that 
would threaten the climate of economic stability which has been achieved in 
recent years.
   It is expected to be compounded by unfavourable economic prospects 
especially following the recent decline in coffee prices. The end of this 
coffee boom was marked by the October fall in the value of the shilling, after 
a two year spell of stability, the EIU report notes.

South Africa
Foreign Trip Could Clear Constitutional Logjam 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Marion Edmunds

   Johannesburg - Over drinks in hotel bars in Germany last week, new 
friendships were formed that bode well for the writing of the final 
constitution.
   During a week-long, fact-finding tour to Germany, Inkatha Freedom 
Party (IFP), African National Congress (ANC) and National Party (NP) 
politicians were able, for the first time since the IFP walked out of 
the Constitutional Assembly last year, to talk to each other -- 
sometimes late into the night -- about South Africa's constitutional 
future.
   Back home this week, the delegates were cautiously optimistic about 
the effect the mission would have on the constitution-writing process 
and, in particular, on the stand-off between the IFP and the ANC over 
international mediation.
   At this stage -- and it is early days yet -- the signs of a new 
interparty rapport are good, with even the IFP delegates taking a more 
amiable line than usual.
   IFP negotiator, Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela, said 
this week he had already briefed party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi about 
the trip and Buthelezi had been "positively surprised" at what he had to 
say.
   Mzimela said of the trip: "I think we got the chance to interact 
across party lines ... if the group had had the power to make decisions, 
certainly there would have been movement on issues because we were able 
to understand a lot of things collectively."
   Mzimela believed there would be follow-up talks between parties on 
what had been learnt, but would not commit himself on whether the IFP 
would return to the Constitutional Assembly to participate fully in the 
final, and most important, phases of the constitutional negotiations.
   He said international mediation had not been mentioned during the 
visit, and in any case "the media have overplayed the whole issue".
   "If we in South Africa could solve our problems, we would not need 
international mediation ... what we did realise abroad was that the 
international mediation was not just an IFP and ANC problem, it was a 
problem to be resolved by all the parties," he said.
   A source in the German delegation said that a particularly good 
relationship had been established between the three M's -- Mzimela, 
National Party Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer, and his ANC 
deputy Valli Moosa -- the same trio who met to resolve the international 
mediation crisis last year, and abandoned the attempt in bad humour.
   Democratic Party constitutional expert Colin Eglin said this week the 
trip could be intepreted as a "diluted form of international mediation", 
as it was away from home and because they learnt from the Germans.
   A report on the tour is being drawn up by the three technical 
advisers who accompanied the team. It is possible that this report will 
form the basis of further discussions with the IFP and parties within 
the Constitutional Assembly.

Moseneke To Lead PAC?  

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Vuyo Mvoko

   Johannesburg - Former Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) deputy president 
and now chairman of Telkom, Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, has been 
approached to lead the party.
    This was confirmed by PAC MP Patricia de Lille late this week. De 
Lille, however, said she did not yet know what his response has been.
   This follows the resignation of general secretary Maxwell 
Nemadzivhanani early this week, which renewed attention to the troubled 
party.
   Nemadzivhanani said he had received a lot of criticism from party 
members, and so felt he should hand over to other "capable" people. He 
told the Mail & Guardian he planned to look for work in the government, 
but he was keeping his options open.
   Since its disastrous results in both the 1994 national elections and 
last year's local government elections, the PAC has been plagued by 
allegations of leadership ineptitude which were particularly directed at 
its dour president Clarence Makwetu.
   Makwetu held on to the party's senior position by eight votes in 
1994, against a last-minute challenge from Motsoko Pheko, who had 
arrived from overseas on the penultimate day of the party's four-day 
congress in Mmabatho. Pheko is now deputy president and most likely to 
be elected president.
   Last month the PAC's student wing the Pan Africanist Students 
Organisation (Paso), declared the party was in an "anarchical state of 
affairs" and was experiencing a "leadership crisis".
   Paso called for the ousting of Makwetu, Maxwell Nemadzivhanani (whom 
they described as "arrogant and devisive"), MP Gora Ibrahim, and former 
deputy president Johnson Mlambo.
   Following Paso's call the PAC National Executive Committee decided to 
change the status of the party's annual general conference, scheduled 
for Easter weekend, to a congress where a new leadership can be elected.
   De Lille confirmed there was a lot of agitation within the party, but 
denied it was crumbling to the ground.
   Moseneke told the M&G: "No. I decline. It's great to know I'm still 
loved out there, but I have no interest in a political career."

South Africa
Report takes WWF To 'Tusk' 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch and Rehana Rossouw

   Johannesburg - The Department of Military Intelligence was heavily 
involved in the illegal sale of elephant tusks from Angola between 1978 
and 1986 -- and a commission of inquiry, established by the South 
African Defence Force in 1988 to probe these deals, was a white-wash.
   This is the main finding of the Kumbleben Commission which this week 
released a 200-page report about its inquiry into the smuggling of rhino 
horn and elephant tusks in South Africa. The commission was appointed by 
President Nelson Mandela in October 1994.
   Justice ME Kumbleben also criticises Operation Lock, the 
controversial covert operation by former British special forces officers 
to combat poaching in Southern Africa in the late 1980s, and says the 
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the head of its South African branch must 
take some responsibility for the behaviour of this unit.
   The Kumbleben report finds there was large-scale destruction of 
wildlife, including elephants and rhinos, in north-eastern Namibia and 
Angola as a result of the 1980s wars in those countries. Most of the 
ivory and rhino horn obtained by poachers during this period was 
illegally exported through South Africa by SADF military intelligence.
   The Roos Commission, set up by the defence force in 1988 to probe 
press reports of military involvement in the illicit trade, claimed that 
only about 500 tusks captured by Unita from poachers were handled by the 
military from 1978 onwards.
   Kumbleben describes this commission as a "charade" designed to 
exonerate the SADF.
   The report lambasts a scheme hatched by conservationists in the late 
1980s to use former British special forces officers to combat poaching 
in Southern Africa. It describes Operation Lock -- financed by Prince 
Bernhard of the Netherlands and set up by John Hanks (then the WWF's 
project manager at its headquarters in Geneva) -- as being "accountable 
to no one".
   Kumbleben also suggests that more than 100 rhino horns provided to 
these officers by the Natal Parks Board and conservation authorities in 
Namibia for supposed sting operations were later misappropriated by 
members of Operation Lock.
   Sections of the report contain extracts from a secret document 
(called Q in the report) which shows that the anti-poaching operation 
was infiltrated by members of South African military intelligence after 
it set up headquarters in South Africa. This was apparently designed to 
ensure Operation Lock could be "put to good use by the necessary South 
African information collecting departments".
   The document claims that Colonel Ian Crooke, the commander of 
Operation Lock, had offered to help in "the monitoring of anti-South 
African bodies which are situated overseas".
   Evidence presented to the commission suggests that document Q -- 
which appears to be an internal Operation Lock memo -- was drawn up by a 
South African military intelligence officer called Mike Richards, who 
had managed to infiltrate the operation.
   Kumbleben questions claims by Hanks that the WWF, the world's biggest 
conservation NGO, was not aware of Operation Lock's activities.
    It goes on to stress, however, that "those responsible for putting 
Lock in place did not have the ulterior motive of Lock functioning as 
some sort of espionage or intelligence collecting agency for the RSA. It 
was intended by them to be an anti-poaching or anti-smuggling operation 
and nothing more. It may have later been contaminated by other 
objectives and considerations referred to in document Q."
   Hanks said his involvement in purchasing rhino horn to entrap 
smugglers was a sincere attempt to save Africa's dwindling black rhino 
stocks.
   "It was nothing to do with Operation Lock, it was a totally different 
project. The WWF had done nothing wrong in this regard."
   With the assistance of Prince Bernhard, Hanks raised R250 000 to 
purchase rhino horn to trap smugglers. Although the horn was never again 
accounted for, Hanks believes it was money well spent. "There was a 
group of people tested to do the undercover work. They never reported to 
the WWF."
   Hanks said he could not comment further until he had read the 
Kumbleben report.

De Kock Trial To Focus On Mlangeni Assassination 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Mail & Guardian reporter

   Johannesburg - The Eugene de Kock trial reopens on Monday with a 
cross-examination of former Vlakplaas policeman Joe Mamasela who is 
expected to provide the court with details about police involvement in a 
number of political murders in the 1980s.
   The trial will then focus on the assassination of human rights lawyer 
Bheki Mlangeni whose head was blown apart by a bomb planted in a 
cassette recorder.
   A number of witnesses -- including the man who manufactured the 
Mlangeni bomb -- are likely to tell the court that De Kock, former 
commander of the notorious Vlakplaas unit, arranged for the deadly 
parcel to be sent to his old enemy, renegade policeman Dirk Coetzee, in 
London.
   Coetzee was unable to pay demurrage costs in Lusaka and it was then 
sent back to lawyer Bheki Mlangeni who had been listed as the sender. 
When Mlangeni received the package, he placed a cassette in the 
recorder, put on the headphones and detonated the device.
   The Transvaal Attorney General's office may interrupt the trial after 
it resumes in order to charge De Kock in connection with the smuggling 
of weapons to Inkatha Freedom Party paramilitary camps during the early 
1990s.
   Senior IFP officials -- including Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu -- 
will be implicated in the gun-running operations while the name of 
Inkatha senator Phillip Powell is expected to feature prominently in the 
case.
   The Mail & Guardian is aware that the AG's office is also working on 
prosecutions against three police generals mentioned by Judge Richard 
Goldstone as having been involved in dirty tricks operations. These are 
Krappies Engelbrecht, Basie Smit and Johan le Roux.
   Officials in the AG's office declined to comment on the matter.
   These cases are due to be finalised this year.

Is TV Relaunching ... Or Re-sinking? 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy and Justin Pearce 

   Johannesburg - The grand plan for a spectacular relaunch of the SABC 
to shake off the last vestiges of its heritage as a bastion of Afrikaner 
nationalism, has been dampened by a last-ditch bid by the language 
lobby.
   When the Rapportryers and other bodies dedicated to the protection of 
the Afrikaans language signalled that they would fight -- through the 
courts, if necessary -- any downgrading of their language on the 
national broadcaster, the Independent Broadcasting Authority had to sit 
up and take note. In the interim Constitution, the Afrikaans language 
lobby has a powerful weapon, and the Independent Broadcasting Authority 
(IBA), which had been relaxed about the formalities of SABC's planned 
changes, would be vulnerable to legal attack if it did not follow the 
letter of the law and hold public hearings, which would allow the 
language lobby to pursue its objections.
   That sparked off this week's power struggle between the two premier 
bodies of South African broadcasting, both of which are determined to 
show that they are in charge of reshaping the public broadcaster.
   The SABC for the moment lacks IBA approval to amend its television 
broadcast licences in such a way as to allow the corporation to spread 
South African languages equitably across all three new channels as it 
had planned to do next month. The IBA is refusing to give this approval 
until public hearings have been held in terms of the Broadcasting Act.
   The SABC is to press on with its plans to relaunch its TV services on 
February 4, but the still-unchanged broadcast licences mean the 
corporation now has two weeks to revise schedules which took months to 
compile.
   The IBA and SABC accuse each other of provoking this crisis. The SABC 
said it had held discussions with the IBA as early as September and that 
the regulatory body was "well aware" of what was coming.
   IBA sources in turn said the authority had repeatedly informed SABC 
top management of the need to make a formal application to amend its 
broadcast licence.
   The SABC further alleges that, based on discussions held between the 
parties, there "did not seem to be a problem" until earlier this week 
when press reports alerted the SABC to the IBA's decision against 
granting an immediate amendment. The possibility of legal irregularities 
in the SABC's plans was first made public when Afrikaner organisations 
threatened the SABC with court action.
   The Rapportryersbeweging said programme restructuring and language 
changes by the SABC were being done single-handedly by the corporation. 
The Rapportryers threatened to take the SABC to court and to make 
submissions to the IBA regarding the planned relaunch.
   The IBA was alerted and the SABC was informed that it would have to 
comply by amending its licence and allowing for public scrutiny.
   SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu said the launch on February 4 
was not challenged by the IBA at the parties' last meeting in mid-
December, adding that the corporation was "made to understand that the 
amendment would be a minor technicality". The IBA denied this.
   Some sources see the IBA-SABC wrangle as a misunderstanding due to 
bad communication; others believe it is a power struggle over who has 
the greater authority, while others insinuate that were it not for the 
stir caused by the Afrikaner men-only movement, the stand-off between 
the parties would have been averted.
   The question that remains is whether the two had agreed in principle 
on the amendment being granted as a mere formality and whether plans 
were upset by a small Afrikaans fringe group insisting on its democratic 
right to scrutinise the new SABC changes.
   SABC communications head Ken Modise insisted that no individual was 
responsible for the misunderstanding, since each meeting between the 
parties was attended by at least three representatives from each 
organisation.
   IBA spokesman Amos Vilakazi denied that there was a power struggle 
between them, adding that the IBA was merely doing its regulatory duty.
   The SABC is adamant that it was complying with the Broadcasting Act 
by handing in its application for an amendment when it did. According to 
one SABC official, the IBA had dragged its heels in getting the 
application gazetted and this contributed to the delay in notifying the 
public of imminent changes within the SABC.
   There is a feeling within the SABC that the IBA was whipping up a 
logistical storm in a teacup, and that it did not have the right to 
dictate the language preference used on the SABC.
   The IBA, however, felt that the handing in of the application two 
months ago -- in early October rather than in mid-December -- would have 
been more acceptable and would have allowed for public scrutiny.
   "The effect of the application is that it transforms public 
broadcasting in this country and, while we are not opposed to the SABC, 
we are opposed to the procedurally incorrect manner in which it has gone 
about doing it," an IBA source said. He stressed the IBA was merely 
doing its job as a media regulator.
   In the wake of this week's fiasco, SABC management has asserted its 
commitment to public consultation, and has argued that going ahead with 
its revised plan was the best way to give the public an idea of what the 
changes involved.
   "We believe the public will be better informed once they have seen 
what is offered," Modise said.
   Modise confirmed that the corporation is to go ahead with its 
February 4 relaunch while still abiding by the terms of its existing 
licences. This will, however, involve a rearrangement of the schedules 
in order to keep the dominant languages on each channel the same as at 
present.
   SABC sources suggest the corporation paid little attention to the 
need to seek a formal licence amendment, lulled into false security by 
the fact that the IBA had raised no objections when African languages 
were introduced into TV1's Good Morning South Africa.
   However, licences stipulate the dominant languages for each channel. 
While the GMSA changes did not change the status of English and 
Afrikaans as the dominant languages on TV1, the changes that were 
planned for February 4 would have reached much further.
   Briefing TV staff on Wednesday, Jill Chisholm, head of Television 
News Production and acting head of television, pointed out there was no 
precedent for a South African broadcaster applying for a licence 
amendment as opposed to a fresh licence, hence the lack of clarity over 
correct procedure.
   Chisholm also expressed disappointment that changes which "are part 
of a root and branch transformation" of the SABC had been stymied by the 
problems raised by the IBA, when in fact the IBA and SABC were in 
agreement on the kind of transformation which the corporation needed to 
undergo.
   Stressing the need for discretion, Chisholm expressed concern about 
"running into IBA sensitivities about power and authority".
   Wednesday's briefing was the first time that staff who will be 
implementing the new programme format had been officially informed of 
the plans. Chisholm apologised to staff for the fact that they had heard 
about the changes in line-up in the press before being briefed by the 
SABC. The briefing was intended to take place earlier but had been 
delayed.
   Staffers have in the meantime voiced frustration at what they see as 
the superficial nature of the changes planned at the SABC, at the 
confusion over the lines of managerial command, and at the corporation's 
tardiness in informing them about the changes.

News Viewers Vote With Their Remotes 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The SABC's news and actuality coverage -- the mainstay 
of the broadcaster's operation -- has lost more than a quarter of a 
million viewers over the past year.
   The corporation's eight o'clock English news slot has suffered a drop 
of a minimum of 100 000 viewers, while the equivalent 30-minute 
Afrikaans bulletin lost 200 000 viewers.
   The new, "improved" Agenda Newsline also suffered a decline of about 
100 000 viewers, but it is not clear from market research where the 
audience has moved to.
   There has been a "steady decrease" in the number of people who watch 
news and actuality, said SABC news and actuality research manager, Dr. 
Stoffel Blaauw, adding that people either watch only half the news, 
change channels, or just switch off their television sets for the night.
   Blaauw said the decline began when the SABC shifted from being a 
commercial broadcaster to becoming a public broadcaster, adding that the 
drop of 300 000 viewers was a "minimum average" of the total number of 
people lost to news and actuality.
   "The drop began as early as September 1993, when the political agenda 
of the SABC changed and it had to adapt to a changing South Africa by 
ridding itself of the stereotyped black television channels -- the 
former TV2 and TV3 -- and market a television service that was more 
representative of the broader spectrum of South Africans," Blaauw said.
   He said the SABC's top brass was trying its best to broadcast to all 
language groups but, because it was a mammoth task and one could not be 
all things to all people, certain local English and Afrikaans groups 
were becoming "increasingly annoyed" with the drop in standards of 
television, especially news and actuality.
   With about 10,5-million households connected to television, a steady 
decline of this nature could see a drop of close to a million viewers by 
the time the next elections are due.
   Blaauw predicted that people would be increasingly incensed to find 
that, with the relaunching of channels, the corporation was using 
material which was "currently on the shelf" because of time and 
budgetary constraints.
   He said top management was, despite having its own agenda, open to 
suggestions gathered from research conducted and keen to improve the 
image of the SABC, but added that the "new look" SABC would be a case of 
"let's wait and see what happens".

Rugby: Luyt Dynasty Expands Its Turf 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Nicole Fritz and Vuyo Mvoko

    Johannesburg - Rian Oberholzer, Louis Luyt's son-in-law, has left 
his job as South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) tournament 
director to take up a permanent appointment in Australia as chief 
executive of Sanza -- the company which will control rugby broadcasts in 
the southern hemisphere.
   Sanza came into being after a R2-billion deal Luyt, together with 
Australia's Leo Williams and New Zealand's Richie Guy, signed with media 
mogul Rupert Murdoch.
   Effectively, this contract gives Murdoch exclusive television rights 
to all southern hemisphere provincial and international rugby for the 
next 10 years.
   Oberholzer's appointment as head of Sanza is being seen in some 
circles as a transcontinental expansion of the Luyt dynasty -- which 
includes Luyt's son, Louis Luyt junior, who is general manager of Ellis 
Park and Luyt senior's personal assistant.
   Oberholzer is also a trustee of the Transvaal Rugby Sports Trust. The 
trustees control voting rights and rights to dividends and interest in 
respect of the Transvaal Rugby Football Union's investment in Ellis 
Park.
   Oberholzer's move and reports of Luyt's property sales have fuelled 
speculation that Luyt intends to leave the country. Two weeks ago the 
Mail & Guardian reported Luyt's house in the plush Johannesburg suburb 
of Saxonwold had been placed on the market, apparently for a staggering 
R7-million.
   It has also been reported that Luyt's luxurious Ballito holiday-home 
was up for sale over the festive season, but was inexplicably withdrawn 
after a short period.

Education In Crisis: Teachers Face Cut-backs 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Philippa Garson and Vusi Mona

   Johannesburg - TENS of thousands of teachers around the country will 
soon have to pack up their bags and move to under-resourced schools or 
be retrenched.
   The government's commitment to equity in schools and the severe 
constraints on the education budget mean many schools will have to cut-
back on the number of teachers they employ.
   The squeeze on the education budget, and the fact that many provinces 
have already overspent on last year's budget, is forcing schools to cut 
back on the number of teachers they employ by increasing teacher/pupil 
ratios to 1:40 in primary schools and 1:35 in high schools over a period 
of five years and cutting back on subject choices.
   Ironically, the subjects the country needs the most in terms of human 
resource development, like science, will be the first to go, because 
these are the smaller, and more expensive classes to run. So too will 
the better, more experienced teachers bear the brunt of the cut-backs, 
as they are the more expensive to employ.
   But the only way that provinces can balance their books is by 
slashing back on teachers salaries -- which swallow 85% of the education 
budget. According to some, the number of teachers currently in 
employment is roughly adequate for the country as a whole. For others, 
no amount of redeployment will absorb the excess number of teachers 
generated by the new teacher/pupil ratios. The 1994 national 
teacher/pupil ratio was 1:34 in primary schools and 1:27 in high 
schools, implying that enforced new ratios will generate a surplus of 
teachers. There are already as many as 15 000 unemployed teachers.
   Glaring inequities exist in terms of teacher distribution, with an 
abundance of teachers and small classes in most formerly white schools. 
It is in the many township schools, in peri-urban informal settlements 
and in rural areas, where teacher shortages exist.
   Teachers wanting to keep their jobs will have no option but to 
relocate to the areas where they are needed. But moving teachers to 
poorer areas brings with it a host of legal, financial and social 
obstacles, said Peter Buckland of the National Business Initiative. In 
terms of the Educators' Employment Act, affecting state-aided or model C 
schools, schools have the right to choose which teachers to employ. To 
redeploy teachers would mean amending this legislation.
   Moving teachers to other schools also implies the need for travel 
costs, relocation costs and in some cases, accommodation costs -- money 
which the government doesn't seem to have.
   Then there is teachers' resistance to moving on the one hand, and 
communities' antagonism towards "outside" teachers coming to take up 
jobs when their own teachers are unemployed. Many white teachers would 
balk at moving to volatile informal settlements where they may not be 
welcome.
   The South African Teachers Union has agreed in principle to 
redeployment, if it means that jobs can be saved. "We are backing 
redeployment in that we are backing teachers' jobs. But we need a 
strategy to attract teachers to impoverished areas," said general 
secretary Thulas Nxesi.
   Issues such as housing arrangements and travel allowances would have 
to be negotiated, Nxesi added, warning that last-resort retrenchments 
would meet with resistance. "We don't believe there's an oversupply of 
teachers. If they talk retrenchments we will do whatever we can to 
protect our members' jobs."
    Gauteng MEC Mary Metcalfe said travelling expenses could not be paid 
however. She said redeployment had already been negotiated with the 
teachers' unions for the moving of teachers "from the better-off to the 
more under-resourced schools to be phased in over the next two years. 
People will be offered redeployment to areas within reasonable distances 
from where they live.
   "Educationally we'd agree that smaller class sizes are better but we 
are going through a period of massive reconstruction and we simply 
cannot afford smaller classroom sizes."
   Metcalfe added however that even if the new ratios were complied 
with, the province could still not meet its budget. This would point 
towards inevitable retrenchments. Metcalfe refused to confirm this in 
the absence of a finalised budget or negotiations.
   According to Jane Hofmeyr, also of the NBI, "teachers will have to be 
retrenched unless we relook at the teacher/pupil ratios and the 
education budget". In her view, it is time to consider loans from the 
World Bank. "We don't want a debt trap forever but there are few 
countries that don't use loans at some time or another. It is a critical 
time for us in terms of human resource development."

Rector Urges Universities To Share Apartheid's Backlogs

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Philippa Garson

   Johannesburg - The call by the University of the Western Cape's new 
rector, Cecil Abrahams, for the province's three universities to take 
joint responsibility for its disadvantaged students has prompted mildly 
defensive attitudes from two wealthier sisters, the University of Cape 
Town and the University of Stellenbosch.
   Abrahams has called for the three universities in the Western Cape to 
share the burden of disadvantaged students and take some of the load off 
his own university with a streamlined, common admissions centre.
   Abrahams outlined his proposal in a graduation speech at UCT last 
month, calling for "universities as a collective (to) establish a common 
applications centre where we agree to divide among ourselves a pre-
determined percentage of applicants who have been historically 
oppressed.
   "I propose as well that we address together the difficult financial 
situation facing students. It is vitally important that the university 
sector in this region develop in an orderly and financially viable 
manner. This is not a time for any one of our universities to gloat at 
the struggles and misfortunes of a particular university," he said.
   Abrahams told the Mail & Guardian the educational and financial 
poverty of disadvantaged students should be the responsibility of all 
three institutions. "This would reduce the responsibility of one 
university to deal with all the backlogs apartheid created."
   He said he feared a repeat of last year's admissions saga at UWC 
which resulted in scores of students being turned away for non-payment 
of fees.
   Abrahams said that UCT's response had been "polite", and Stellenbosch 
had not yet responded. He hoped however to schedule a meeting on the 
issue next month.
   UCT acting Vice-Chancellor Wieland Gewers said he was "very 
interested" in the line taken by Abrahams, but suggested that many co-
operative developments had taken place of which Abrahams had perhaps not 
been aware.
   "We've been very active in inter-technikon and university co-
operation in the Western Cape." A group of five institutions, namely the 
three Western Cape universities, Peninsula Technikon and Cape Technikon, 
has established a vice-rectors' group that meets frequently to promote 
co-operation on issues of common concern like staff development and 
sharing of libraries, said Gewers.
   The Western Cape Tertiary Institutions Trust had already raised funds 
for all the institutions and a single mechanism for all five libraries 
was being implimented. Gewers hinted that Abrahams was "not fully 
conversant with the number of students we do have that are black (51%). 
"
   He said that his university was flooded with 17 000 applications this 
year and had only 3 000 places.
   The University of Stellenbosch was also keen to remind Abrahams of 
existing regional co-operation structures and of its own numbers of 
disadvantaged students, which the university was already battling to 
fund.
   Stellensbosch Vice-Chancellor A Van Wyk said the university had been 
increasing its admission of disadvantaged students at an "exponential 
rate and 17% of 1995's intake of first year students were from that 
group." Van Wyk said Abrahams suggestions, which he noted with 
"interest", should be taken to the National Commission on Higher 
Education.
    Abrahams said he was aware of the Committee of Five Tertiary 
Institutions but believed the issue was "urgent enough" to be dealt with 
by top leadership as soon as possible.

Intelligence To Investigate Police Spy Scandal 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg - Intelligence officials hope to have their own 
investigation into the police bugging scandal wrapped up as early as 
next week and will be forwarding a report to both President Nelson 
Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
   "We will get to the bottom of this -- the who, the how and the why," 
deputy co-ordinator of intelligence Moe Shaik said this week of the 
spying row which saw police and intelligence chiefs all but accuse each 
other of lying.
   The investigation by the National Intelligence Co-ordinating 
Committee (NICOC) centres on allegations that former security policeman 
Dirk Coetzee, now an National Intelligence Agency operative, told SAPS 
member Inspector H Moodley he had been assigned to spy on top-ranking 
policemen -- a charge Coetzee denies.
   The probe also focuses on whether or not listening devices or 
equipment were found connected to top-ranking policemen's telephones.
   Shaik refused to comment this week when asked whether an 
investigation by Telkom had thrown doubt on whether bugs were in fact 
found.
   He did however concede a failure to properly assess the impact the 
allegations could have if made public. Shaik said he discussed "rumours 
circulating" with SAPS commissioner George Fivaz as soon as he heard of 
them. Fivaz "was aware of them and could put them in context". In what 
proved a serious miscalculation, they agreed to let the matter rest 
there.
   Shaik said this week: "Our collective response was sluggish. A story 
we dismissed as media hype, that we thought was essentially a non-issue, 
threatened to become a national crisis.
   "The lesson to be learned is that we need mechanisms to deal with any 
issue that -- whether deliberately or unintentionally -- could threaten 
the fragility of the transition."
   The investigation, by the NICOC, is one of three launched in the wake 
of newspaper reports that the National Intelligence Agency was bugging 
top-ranking policemen. Coetzee, Moodley and his commander, the head of 
the National Priority Crimes Unit, Major-General Suiker Brits had all 
been interviewed, Shaik said.
   A judge to head an independent inquiry announced by Deputy President 
Thabo Mbeki last week has yet to be appointed, although Minister of 
Justice Dullah Omar told the M&G he expected an announcement would be 
made during the course of next week.
   Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence will be meeting 
on February 7 to consider reports it has called for from both the SAPS 
and NIA and to decide whether to call individuals to testify before it. 
Its inquiry begins officially on February 12.
   Shaik said NICOC's report would first be discussed within the 
committee, which brings together the National Crime Intelligence Service 
of the SAPS, the NIA and the South African Secret Service, before being 
forwarded to President Mandela and Deputy President Mbeki for a decision 
on how to proceed.

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)

by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg - National Party leader F. W. de Klerk has yet again had 
to insist that rumours of his party's imminent demise were exaggerated.
   De Klerk's irritation was not so much with the "disgruntled 
individuals" who, by leaking a strategy document to the Afrikaans Sunday 
newspaper Rapport had set themselves "on a course of sabotage", but with 
the fact that the document had been interpreted as saying the NP was 
preparing to dissolve.
   De Klerk faced having to correct this misinterpretation by saying 
what was really intended -- that far from dissolving, the NP meant to 
act like an alka-seltzer on the political digestive tract, saving it 
from the indigestibility of a one-party state threatened by the ANC's 
dominance.
   But his ire was compounded at having to show more of his hand than he 
would have liked. The plan was for him to unveil the vision of a new, 
right-of-centre political movement, aimed at injecting fluidity into 
South Africa's democracy, on February 2.
   Seeing De Klerk, flanked by NP executive director Fanus Schoeman, 
media head Marthinus Van Schalkwyk and Cape leader Dawie de Villiers, a 
question arose. How could they expect the public to have confidence in 
their ability to transform the political landscape when rearranging the 
furniture within their own party was proving so problematic?
   In fact, De Klerk does not see the NP  as necessarily leading the 
movement it is proposing, which will need substantial black support to 
survive.
   He has been engaged in intensive talks with business, religious and 
community leaders he wants to support the formation of a movement, 
founded on Christian values, that could draw support on issues like 
bringing back capital punishment, retaining anti-abortion laws, lowering 
taxes and limiting state power.
   He wants to establish common ground with the other minority parties 
through "regular discussions", but an alliance is not necessarily going 
to emerge. Essentially, NP strategists are looking for growth to 
congregants in the ANC's church who might be encouraged, ahead of 1999 
and a new general election, to cross the floor.
   These are non-racial issues, around which De Klerk hopes to rally 
people on the basis of shared values as a way of shattering what NP 
strategists see as racially-based voting patterns.
   A clause in the interim constitution demands that MPs crossing the 
floor resign their seats. It is not repeated in the draft new 
constitution, but may yet appear: the ANC would not want members elected 
by voters who backed the party, rather than voting for an individual, 
free to do political waltzes.
   But members -- and supporters -- might just be tempted, if there was 
a viable opposition amounting to more than tiny parties relegated to 
being permanent opponents of the majority party without any hope of ever 
coming into power. To be viable, it would have to be non-racial and 
forward-looking, with no hint of being concerned with furthering narrow 
ethnic interests.

South Africa
Soccer: This Fish Is Poetry In Motion 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Mark Gevisser

   Johannesburg - Monday afternoon at the Old Eds Health & Racquet Club 
in Houghton. It's only 48 hours after they were crowned national heroes, 
and the Bafana Bafana seem bemused, rather than irritated, by the fact 
that only a few autograph-hunting children recognise them. "Excuse me!" 
calls a fluorescent kugel, "what team are you?"
   Doctor and Shoes have led an invasion of the aerobics class, pealing 
with laughter as they throw their gold around. Zane, meanwhile, is 
throwing indignant teenage girls off exercycles. Augie is primping his 
pecs down in freeweights. Coach Clive is gamely puffing his way through 
a circuit. The Feesh, it goes without saying, is in the water, doing 
laps.
   Later, signature bird's-nest hair tamed by a back-to-front baseball 
cap, the youngest member of the South African squad  -- and the one most 
likely to hit the international big time -- lopes across the floor to 
laugh at his buddies in the aerobics class.
   There's something mesmerising about Mark Fish. The gangly white boy's 
jerky, too-long limbs sometimes seem to be caught in adolescence (he is 
21), beyond his control, until they snap, in a moment, into the machine-
like precision which earned him the "Man of the Match" vote last 
Saturday when South Africa trounced Cameroon.
   There's no white player black South Africans love more; there's no 
South African defender who gets as much attention from the crowd. 
"Feeeesh!" the supporters cried every time his boot tapped the ball on 
Saturday. "Feeeesh" they cry every time he plays for Orlando Pirates.
   And it's not just because his name, like "Shhhhoooeees", rolls easily 
off the collective tongue of a stadium-full of people. It's not just 
because he is a defender who never loses a tackle, no matter how 
aggressive the striker, who is given to blazing lone storms across the 
length of the field into the other team's goal-box and who reads a game 
like no one else on the field. No, it's because he is raw, a rebel, easy 
to find (that hair!), easy to read.
   There's something intimidating about the artistry of a Khumalo or a 
Mosheou, something inaccessible about the lofty Masinga; through Feesh, 
though, you can live the match, following the fortunes of your team as 
they ripple through his posture and register on his features.
   Coach Clive Barker puts it best: "What impresses most people about 
Mark Fish is his body language. He's unpredictable, a character. A Jonty 
Rhodes, a James Small. He betrays to the crowds what we're trying to get 
across."
   Barker clearly adores his youngest ward: "He's not my first choice 
for the national team! He's my first, second and third choice!" The 
bluff, no-nonsense coach plays his part so perfectly you wonder if he 
hasn't stepped off the pages of Whizzer & Chips. But Fish stirs even the 
coach to poesy: "If I were in the trenches of World War I and I had Mark 
Fish next to me, even if there were 1 000 soldiers storming us, I'd be 
convinced we'd still win. He's a fighter."
   It's no secret there are talent scouts from the European clubs here 
for the African Cup of Nations, and they've got their eyes on Fish. 
There have been rumours about Manchester United, and it's believed the 
Italians are also showing interest. Soccer writers caution, though, that 
a star in malnourished South Africa might not even register a blip on 
the Italian or British landscape.
   Barker believes that Fish "may have the potential to hit the jackpot, 
to make the big league if he manages things right. But he may yet go 
into the category of the George Bests." Fish, you see, is Party Animal 
Number One in the South African squad. He loves to drink and he can get 
unruly. The squad still chuckle at how he told Mike Atherton he was 
"ugly".
   "He loves a good party," says Barker, "and his parties go on longer 
than anyone else's." As does his hair, even though Barker's caught wind 
of a rumour that, if the Bafana Bafana get to the finals, a certain 
Feesh might be sporting an "exotic, punk, short, blue do".
   There's none of that Mark Fish sitting opposite me at the bar of the 
Sunnyside Hotel. He is the consummate Pretoria Boys High alumnus: well-
spoken, very polite. He talks, for example, of "Mr Barker" and "Mr 
Mandela".
   It's clear he doesn't really like the limelight, but he plays ball 
anyway, attempting to answer questions and admitting, sheepishly, that 
his mind is elsewhere. Despite his youth, he is one of the most popular 
members of the squad: it's hard not to like him.
   He is not self-conscious about being a white boy in a black sport. 
His best buddy -- and room mate at the Sunnyside -- is Pirates captain 
and fellow Pretoria homeboy (and rabble-rouser) Edward Motale. "Fish," 
says Motale, "is not like other whites. I take him to Mamelodi, to 
Tembisa, and he'll get up and dance even though he's the only white. He 
won't give a damn, he'll just boogie and then others will join him. With 
other whites it's different. They need special attention one cannot 
afford."
   After Saturday's victory, Fish chose to go with his mates to a bar, 
"Tings and Times" in Pretoria, rather than joining the team at the 
Randburg Waterfront. Johannesburg, he says, is "flashy and phoney and 
false, all these guys who dress to impress". Motale often accompanies 
him on his Pretoria sorties -- a place not known for its mixed venues -- 
where the pair has become known as "New South Africa".
    Fish lives in one of our land's strange interstices, unrecognised by 
his home culture, but a folk hero to millions. "I'll go to a restaurant 
with a girlfriend and the only one who'll recognise me is the waiter, 
and he'll insist I go into the back and meet all the kitchen staff."
   Perhaps his ease with this is a function of his youth: he was in 
nappies during the Soweto uprising. He is, truly, a post-apartheid babe. 
Although he is "not rushing to join the ANC", he acknowledges that, 
because soccer has taken him across the railway line, he does have an 
insight into the ravages of apartheid his white peers may not have. But 
there is something a little too defensive -- or perhaps just young -- in 
his comment: "I know about apartheid years, but I wasn't there. It's got 
nothing to do with me. I never hated blacks."
    Fish, like Eddie Motale, spent most of his childhood playing soccer 
at Pretoria club, Arcadia Shepherds. But, while Fish remembers Arcadia 
with unqualified warmth, Motale's stories are full of the slights of 
petty apartheid. He was left behind in the showers when the white boys 
went to the pub, he was dropped from the Colts team even though he was 
clearly the best player and at rival Berea Park he was not allowed to 
use the facilities.
   Fish -- like most white South Africans -- wants to erase race; Motale 
-- like most black South Africans -- can't. Motale lives with his 
parents in Mamelodi; Fish lives with his grandparents in Arcadia. 
Motale's mother is a cleaner at Pretoria University; Fish's mother is a 
sales manageress at Edgars. Motale had a hard time finishing school and, 
aged 29, lives for and through soccer. Fish is in the middle of a Unisa 
marketing degree and thinks he may want to move into sports psychology.
   There are intimations that Fish had a difficult childhood -- his 
parents are divorced, and those who know him well say, elliptically, 
that his drive on the football field is related to his "background" -- 
but he does not talk about this. The greatest conflict of his youth 
seems to have been that timeworn one of white South African schools: 
soccer versus rugby.
   Pretoria Boys High is a great rugby-playing school. They wanted him 
to play rugby, he wanted to play soccer. At primary school, he was head 
boy. But in white South African high schools, soccer -- the terrain of 
dagga-smoking rebels -- is positively unpatriotic, so at "Boys High" 
Fish assumed a more marginal existence. He speaks, now, with 
indignation, about how the school "did nothing for me, and now has the 
cheek to ask me to donate money to a new library. When Robbie Brink made 
the national rugby team, they said he was Boys High's first Springbok. 
Well what about me? I was already playing for the national soccer 
squad!"
   He clearly doesn't like authority. Soccer administration in this 
country is "corrupt ... the administrators get all the money and the 
players don't get the respect they earn. I tell you, if I get picked for 
a European club, if it's Clive Barker as coach I might consider coming 
back to this country. Otherwise, forget it."
   Right now he's listening to the group LIVE on his walkman, 
particularly "this one song, Lightning Crashes, about the world and how 
fucked up it is". It figures that his favourite movie is What's eating 
Gilbert Grape? Even though he is as gregarious as Johnny Depp is dark, 
there's something unmistakably teen-rebel about him. It's not 
nihilistic, wear-black, fuck-you or gangsta-rap rebellion; it's rather 
the indie-rock rebellion of vague social conscience, long sideburns and 
mellow attitude -- REM and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are two of his 
favourite bands.
   And yes, he is a poet. A promising one at that. Changes (see above) 
is filled with the nostalgic romanticism of an alienated Generation-X 
yearning for more essential times, when there was nothing to mediate our 
experience and we were mad bodies "dancing on the hillsides" rather than 
"pair[s] of eyes" staring, through the dark, at TV sets.
   He wrote the poem for Clive Barker's wife, a ballet dancer, but it is 
clearly a meditation on his own career. We are no longer all "dancers", 
but now "cleaved" into "actor and spectators", soccer-stars and fans. 
"We are obsessed with heroes who live for us/ and whom we punish."
   Mark Fish must know that he has now become one of those heroes.
   CHANGES, by Mark Fish 
   Dancer 
   entertain with your 
   sweet dangerous flow.
   I watched your body 
   Excite those eager minds 

   Now your mind 
   must excite these waiting bodies.
   New Woman, timeless dancer 
   Pick your time narrowly though those 
   crowded minds, 
   give your warmth and obedience  
   to these schools of learning.

   There are no longer "dancers" the possessed 
   The cleavage of men into actor and spectators 
   is the central feel of our time.
   We are obsessed with heroes who live for us  
   and whom we punish.

   If all the radios and the televisions were deprived 
   of their sources of power, all books and paintings 
   burned tomorrow, 
   all shows and cinemas closed,  
   all the arts of vicarious existence 
   We are content with the "given" in sensations quest 
   we have been metamorphasised from a mad body dancing 
   on hillsides 
   to a pair of eyes staring the dark.

Mozambique 
Row over IMF Plans

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch and Carlos Cardoso

   Johannesburg - A row has broken out over International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) plans to impose tight curbs on wage hikes and the few social 
security benefits that still exist in Mozambique.
   The country has one of the poorest economies in the world and one of 
the lowest annual incomes per head for its 15-million people: $90 to 
$100 (about R315 to R360).
   The row began when the IMF started negotiating a new agreement with 
the Mozambican government in September last year. The Mozambican 
government had just agreed to increase the minimum wage of $14 (about 
R50) a month by 37,5%.
   The IMF responded by pointing out the post-election government had 
not met all its budget-cutting targets and issued a hard-line statement 
about the need to tighten up the fund's basic controls for Third World 
economies. These include cutbacks in state expenses, curbs on inflation 
and monetary circulation, financial reform and further privatisation.
   Officials from the IMF have since softened their stance after a 
number of Mozambique's donor countries -- which usually back the 
organisation's medicine for ailing economies -- wrote a letter saying 
the Frelimo-led government, which won the election last year, was 
actually doing well in terms of economic reform and that the fund should 
relax its hard line.
   However, IMF officials have indicated they will not relax monetary 
constraints and availability of investment capital until the government 
slashes the country's inflation levels, currently running at around 40%, 
down to 15%.
   The fund has also been criticised for ignoring the informal sector in 
Mozambique. It says this accounts for 30% of the country's GDP, while 
senior government sources insist that it is as high as 60% -- and 
operates as the most important cushion against starvation, rampant crime 
and redistribution of resources.
   Yet average wages for children on the dumbanengues (black markets) 
range from 30 000 to 75 000 meticais (R10 to R25) a month, plus one meal 
-- much less than the already abysmal R50 minimum in the formal sector.
   The International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU), which held a 
workshop in Maputo in November last year, urged the IMF to realise that 
the country's informal sector had mushroomed as a byproduct of the tough 
austerity programme.
   "The government must begin to accord proper attention to the needs of 
workers in this sector, with a view to integrating them into the formal 
economy," says the ICFTU report.
   The ICFTU also urges the fund to negotiate its new package of 
financial constraints for the next three years -- which is expected to 
be finalised in Maputo next month -- with organised labour and emerging 
civic organisations. The international union organisation also wants 
measures designed to ensure food security and social spending for 
vulnerable groups such as women, youth and the aged.

Mozambique
US Millionaire Plans Indian Ocean Dreampark 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Eddie Koch

   Johannesburg - "Yo! You and you! Yo!" The big Texan is standing 
beneath the thudding turbine of a chopper in the middle of the 
Mozambican bush. He is whooping and yelling and pointing at a group of 
bewildered peasants who huddle behind a tree to protect themselves from 
a sandstorm whipped up by the helicopter as it swooped into their 
settlement.
   Gradually, above the cacophony, the villagers realise the American is 
telling some of them to "stop fiddle fucking" (a phrase repeated so 
often it could be called his company's motto), get into the air and take 
a look at the natural beauty that surrounds them. This is John Perrott, 
general manager for flamboyant millionaire James Ulysses Blanchard III, 
and he is bringing his employer's version of rural development to one of 
the poorest countries in the world.
   The vision of Blanchard Mozambique Enterprises is to create a massive 
wildlife and tourism mecca stretching from Inhaca Island off Maputo 
through the staggeringly beautiful Machangulo Peninsula, across the 
Maputo Elephant Park, where one of Africa's last free-ranging elephant 
herds lives, and then down to the South African border in the south.
   The Machangulo Peninsula has the world's highest forested dunes which 
jut, south of the island, into a subtropical sea abounding with coral 
reefs, dolphins, rays, sharks, marine turtles and endangered dugongs 
(strange sea mammal which gave rise to the mermaid legend because it has 
breasts to suckle its young).
   The $800-million masterplan, outlined in a book called the Black 
Bible by Blanchard's men, includes hovercrafts to ferry jetsetting 
tourists from Maputo to Inhaca; a Mississippi Steamer which will become 
a floating hotel and casino off the island; a chain of upmarket lodges 
on the beaches and inland lakes that dot the pensinsula; a national park 
that will be supplied with the big five and other animals in the biggest 
game restocking exercise ever undertaken in human history; scuba diving 
schools; game fishing expeditions; an aquarium; and a steam train to 
ferry tourists through this wonderland of wild game and marine life.
   South African consultants have advised Perrott that his dream to 
import a group of Bushmen from the Kalahari into the Mozambican theme 
park is likely to discredit the project. So has he given up the idea? 
"Hell no! If I get my way, I'll bring some of them little guys out here. 
Can you imagine tourists on the steam train looking out of one window 
and seeing elephants and rhino? Then they'll look out of the other and 
see the little bastards running around with their loin clothes and 
poison-tipped arrows ... The way I see it we'll bring them rhino here 
and save them from going extinct so why not bring the little guys who 
are also going extinct?"
   It is unlikely that either the Botswana or Mozambique governments 
will grant permission for Bushmen to be part of the scheme. But the 
masterplan is being taken seriously by the government in Maputo.
   The biggest obstacle in Perrott's way is that in 1987, at the height 
of Renamo's civil war, the Frelimo-led government granted South African 
timber giant Sappi a concession to plant more than 30 000 hectares of 
land with a plantation of bluegum trees -- in partnership with two 
Mozambican firms.
   The Maputo government's aim was to bring a big South African business 
into the area as a bulwark against bands of Renamo rebels, who waged a 
destructive civil war in the area, with clandestine support from 
elements in the South African military.
   Little thought was given, at that stage, to the fact that the 
concession zone is part of an incredibly rich area of plant diversity, 
known as the Maputaland Centre of Endemism, and that the commercial 
plantation will destroy botanical species which occur no where else on 
Earth and also one of the last tropical grasslands left in southern 
Africa.
   An environmental impact study commissioned by Sappi has recognised 
that the plantation could have serious negative impacts on the 
biodiversity and water resources of southern Maputo province and has 
recommended the planted area be reduced from 32 000 to 21 000 hectares 
so the bluegums can be kept away from rivers and inland lakes in the 
area. The study points out that the plantation, which could earn 
Mozambique some R80-million (about $23-million) a year and create 12 000 
new jobs (not all of them full-time), does not prevent other companies 
from implementing ecotourism programmes in the Elephant Park and on the 
Machangulo Peninsula.
   But Perrott will have none of this. The Blanchard proposal, he 
explains, could bring in an investment of $800-million and will create 
20 000 jobs in the long run. However, it depends on "critical mass", a 
realisation of the grand plan, and it cannot have a patch of bluegums in 
the middle of it.
   So James Ulysses Blanchard III has presented an ultimatum to the 
Mozambicans. He will not go ahead unless Sappi is out.
   Perrott's job is to persuade the local population and the media that 
his boss is right, which is why he is now in the middle of the bush with 
a chopper and a convoy of four-by-fours conducting an exercise in what 
the newspaper contingent on the trip dubbed the Texas School of 
Community Communication.
    While the local chief, his wife and two other volunteers from the 
village are taking a flip in the helicopter, the Texan begins dishing 
out colourful
   T-shirts with a huge map of southern Mozambique on the front 
proclaiming that the area is now a national park. The logo on the back 
says -- in English even though the villagers speak only Shangaan or 
Portuguese -- "Nix to water guzzling bluegums".
   Women, men and children scramble for the T-shirts while a group of 
men gather around Perrott and his Mozambican translator. "Tell them they 
gonna have shares in this project," says Perrott. "The elephants we 
bring here are gonna belong to them too. Now you tell them that in your 
best Shingaan (sic)."
   Perrott insists that a democratic approach is vital for conservation 
to work and that his company will treat the local communities as equal 
partners. "We're gonna put a fence up and make this place a national 
park and they will be able to choose. We gonna come here and say: 'Okay, 
now you're in a national park. Your village can either get fenced in or 
you can have them wild animals walking right through your main street'."
   Early in February the Cabinet will meet in Maputo to decide on the 
bluegum-plantation-versus-ecotheme-park row. The debate has become 
Mozambique's equivalent of the St Lucia controversy in South Africa and 
is likely to be the biggest and most complex economic decision the 
Mozambican government has ever had to make.
   Cabinet members appear divided on the issue. The agriculture ministry 
favours the plantation because it is ready to proceed and will bring 
immediate jobs to the depressed area. The environment ministry wants the 
ecotourism plan because the plantation will cause irreversible damage to 
Mozambican wildlife while it provides raw materials for the South 
African paper industry.
    Another source of concern in the Cabinet is that Blanchard -- a 
cold-war warrior from the 1980s with close links to far-right groups in 
the US --  has good friends in Renamo and also the Inkatha Freedom Party 
in KwaZulu-Natal.
   For the time being though, it appears that opinion in Maputo's 
government and intellectual circles is swinging Blanchard's way. The 
government will insist on a proper land-use plan and assurances that the 
ecotourism project will not be used to benefit Renamo during the next 
elections, or link up with seccessionist movements in KwaZulu-Natal. It 
also plans to set up a group of monitors to ensure that the rhetorical 
commitment to a partnership with the local landowners is put into 
practise.
   But it now seems that the man who once bankrolled a rebel army to 
wage a war of incredible destruction and brutality (the US State 
Department once described Renamo atrocities as worse than those of the 
Pol Pot regime in Cambodia) is likely to be rewarded with control over a 
huge chunk of Mozambique's richest province.
   It is just one of the many paradoxes that pervade this poor country. 
"To understand it," says one of the officials who works with Perrott on 
the project, "you must realise that Mozambique in the past hasn't had 
bulldozers that work. Now we have one that does."

Arts and Culture 
Madonna Of The Margins

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Ricardo Dunn

   Johannesburg -  Mexican artist Frida Kahlo appears on T- shirts, 
calendars and in stage plays. Why are we so fascinated by her?
   Little Frida, a cafe catering to the lesbian and gay community in 
West Hollywood, is a shrine to the memory of Mexican cult-painter Frida 
Kahlo. Surrounded by neo-Mexican decor, inspired by Kahlo's house in 
Mexico City, you can even order a "Frida salad". Little Frida is but one 
outpost in a merchandising empire that churns out T-shirts, earrings, 
aprons, clocks, pins, calenders and posters bearing Kahlo's now world-
famous images. You might even come upon such fetishistic objects as 
Frida Kahlo masks.
   Kahlo's life has been documented in Spanish, English, German, French 
and Japanese. A number of serious biographies can be found on the 
shelves of bookshops and museums; one has even been written for 
children. She has been the subject of documentaries, feature films, 
stage plays -- a character becomes obsessed with her in Harry Kalmer's 
Frida Kahlo's Eyes, now running at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre -- 
numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing. In May 
1989 Elle magazine ran a 16-page feature on Kahlo as embodying the 
"spirit of Mexico", while in Vogue of February 1990 there was a 10-page 
interpretation of the "romance of Frida Kahlo". It comes as no surprise 
that Madonna has invested a sizeable sum in the hopes of bringing the 
Kahlo myth to the silver screen.
   So, who was Frida Kahlo? And what is it about this strikingly 
beautiful but tragically handicapped artist, who painted her life story 
on tin and masonite, that has inspired a huge cult following?
   Kahlo began painting as a teenager in Mexico City in the 1920s, while 
recovering from a near-fatal bus accident in which she was impaled on a 
metal pole. At 21 she married renowned muralist Diego Rivera. Although 
she lived in a conservative, patriarchal culture, and in the heyday of 
murals, when a woman making small, highly personal paintings could not 
win much respect, she valued her idiosyncratic talent. Kahlo challenged 
and refashioned social codes, sometimes by cross- dressing -- appearing 
in photographs or paintings in men's clothing -- or by montaging her 
head on to the bodies of male patriarchs.
   Her self-portraits express the burdens that weighed on her: 
unbearable physical pain, the grief that Rivera's affairs prompted, her 
homesickness when living abroad and her sorrow at not being able to bear 
a child.
   It is tempting to draw parallels between the tragic life of Van Gogh, 
an artist recently made "sexy" by the media, and that of Kahlo. But Van 
Gogh is known primarily for his work. In the case of Kahlo, the popular 
image is of the artist herself: the characteristic eyebrows which she 
connected to create the illusion of masculinity, the elaborate hair, the 
light moustache which she darkened, and, of course, the dressy Mexican 
traditional costumes which she adopted to affirm her identity and to 
hide her broken body. It is her appearance, not her art, that has graced 
the pages of Elle and Vogue.
   Despite Kahlo's larger-than-life standing, she painted less than 150 
pictures in her brief career, with barely half of them considered top-
notch. Admired by Picasso and adored by the Surrealists, she held only 
two shows during her lifetime. Today, prices for her works have 
skyrocketed to more than $3-million a piece.
   The current fascination with Kahlo began in the 1970s, when her work 
generated excitement in the women's liberation movement. But it was 
Hayden Harera's 1983 biography of Kahlo, simply titled Frida, which 
elevated the painter to the level of superstar. 
   Looking at Kahlo's contemporary appeal, Harera writes that '"as a 
Hispanic woman, a bisexual, an invalid and an artist, Kahlo had all the 
qualifications for a cult figure; she embodied everything not straight, 
male and Anglo ... For a people preoccupied with psychological health, 
fearful of Aids and appalled by drug abuse, the gritty strength with 
which she endured her illness is salutory. Although her painting records 
specific moments in her life, all who look at them feel that Frida is 
speaking directly to them."
   This, many say, has led to the representation of Kahlo as a kind of 
mascot of marginalisation. It is the portrayal of Kahlo as a victim that 
has encouraged the many myths that have been formulated around her. 
Stories of her childhood accident and her obsessive relationship with 
Rivera become more brutal and bizarre as they are retold. One story 
maintains that Kahlo's clothes were ripped from her body during the bus 
accident. As she lay naked, a bag of gold-dust that a fellow traveller 
was carrying split open and covered the artist's body. But it is not 
only devotees who have enjoyed fabricating fantastic twists to Kahlo's 
already unconventional life. The artist herself, although born in 1907, 
insisted she was born in 1910 -- the start of the Mexican Revolution. 
   So Kahlo herself contributed to her status as a symbol of cultural 
diversity -- a status some critics say has diluted the significance of 
her work. Yet by demystifying the work of Kahlo and other artists the 
privileged doors of the art world are opened to consumers of popular 
culture. In a 1992 travelling exhibition organised by the Studio Museum 
of Diego Rivera in Mexico City, a number of "Fridita" artists 
participated, while cross- dressing performance artists paid campy 
homage to Kahlo. Many gay artists find Kahlo, who paraded her liaisons 
with other women, a source of strength because of her unconventional 
approach to gender.
   Parodoxically, although Kahlo is considered a populist, she was 
intensely annoyed when she noticed that some of her admirers were 
attempting to adopt her meticulously constructed image. As early as 1933 
she was mocking: "... some of the gringa women are imitating me and 
trying to dress _ la Mexicana but the poor souls only look like cabbages 
and to tell the truth they look absolutely impossible".
   Frida Kahlo's Eyes is at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre until 
February 24

The Soprano Who Stole The Show

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Coenraad Visser

   Johannesburg - After Luciano Pavarotti's concert in early January, 
many were heard to wonder about Kathleen Cassello, the stunning young 
soprano who so completely stole the limelight at this event. Few were 
aware that it is almost exactly 10 years ago that she was a prizewinner 
in the Unisa International Singing Competition in Pretoria.
   Cassello took third place in what was arguably the best field ever 
assembled for this competition. Her fellow victors are also household 
names today: Sumi Jo is the queen of twittering coloratura sopranos, 
while Marilyn Mims is a regular at New York's Metropolitan Opera.
   Cassello, an American whose family hails from Naples, won a string of 
vocal competitions during the 1980s. As the 1985 winner of the Pavarotti 
Competition in Modena, she sang Musetta in Puccini's La Boheme with 
Pavarotti as Rudolfo. After her European debut the same year, she 
travelled the globe, giving more than 200 performances as the Queen of 
the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberflste. 
   Today she sings a wide repertoire, including all the major Mozart 
roles and Verdi heroines such as Leonora in Il Trovatore, Gilda in 
Rigoletto and Violetta in La Traviata. Her Gilda has already proved to 
be rather special: she made her La Scala debut in this role under the 
baton of Riccardo Muti, and was acclaimed last year when she sang as 
Gilda opposite the current tenor heartthrob, Roberto Alagna.
   On the evidence of her Pavarotti concert, Cassello (who, admirers 
will be sad to hear, has not yet made any recordings) is one of the most 
versatile sopranos around. In one evening she was a moving Mimi in 
Puccini's La Boheme, an agonising Violetta, and a powerful Lucia in 
Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.
   One can only hope someone from Pact Opera was there. A house that has 
been so unlucky in the repertoire in which Cassello excels will never be 
forgiven if it fails to secure the services of this exciting singer, in 
the early stages of what promises to be an astounding career.

Pavarotti Against All Odds

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   Johannesburg - They trampled through the dust in their droves to hear 
the rotund tenor from Modena: elderly matrons in bridesmaids' dresses, 
beautiful youngsters in cocktail minis and clumpy designer shoes, and 
sensible folk in gear more befitting the rugby stadium in which the 
concert was held. Inside, vendors of snacks and cold-drinks cried out 
their wares, seemingly oblivious to the occasion.
   Not even a brief downpour could dampen the determination of the 
assembled throng to hear their idol. A pity, then, that the 
circumstances should have been so unfavourable. Over a woefully 
inadequate sound system Pavarotti sounded like he was singing on a 
scratchy 78 recording; bad acoustic planning had the singers' voices 
echoing around the stadium, and the odd sound balance had the orchestra 
playing far away. And the giant television screens which were supposed 
to allow one a close-up view of the singers mostly flickered and went 
blank.
   How does one judge the quality of any performance under these 
circumstances? With great difficulty. What was clear was that, at 60, 
Pavarotti's voice is still in excellent condition when amplified and not 
subject to the strain of projecting without help in a big auditorium. 
One was struck by the ease of his delivery, by those hallmark top notes, 
and by his unique ability to sculpt the Italian texts exquisitely.
   On the other hand, there was frustration at the sameness of his 
characterisations and at his predictable recipe for pleasing the masses: 
his matter-of-fact vocal delivery, slightly rushed, with top notes being 
belted out for all their worth and sustained far longer than required by 
the composers. And then there was the surprising memory lapse in the 
middle of Che gelida manina, an aria he must have sung literally 
hundreds of times around the world.
   It was only in the closing Neapolitan songs and E lucevan le stelle 
from Puccini's Tosca that one heard a true artist at work.
   Rightly, the greatest applause was reserved for soprano Kathleen 
Cassello, who outsang and outacted her mentor in their duets and her 
solo excerpts. Her heartfelt E strano from La Traviata and closely 
characterised Si, mi chiamano Mimi from La Boheme brought the house 
down.
   Conductor Marco Armiliato impressed with his understanding of the 
various operatic styles on the programme. Unfortunately the same cannot 
be said for the ragged National Symphony Orchestra and the surprisingly 
hopeless SABC Choir and the Bonisudumo Choristers. Why bother with this 
odd collection, so clearly unfamiliar with operatic style, when there 
was a superb opera chorus and orchestra just down the road? It was, 
perhaps, simply another instance of bad -- should that be arrogant? ---
artistic judgment.

South Africa Reconsiders Exchange Controls

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Simon Segal 

   Johannesburg - Perhaps the most tricky decision facing South Africa's 
monetary authorities is when to lift exchange controls.
   It might be too slow for some, but South Africa has adopted a phased 
approach. The abolition of the financial rand system in March last year, 
the granting of limited permission for financial institutions to swap 
assets with foreign investors, and the Reserve Bank's (RB) phased 
withdrawal from the forward cover market all reconfirm the authorities' 
determination to liberalise South Africa's foreign exchange market and 
to create an investor-friendly environment for foreigners.
   Some see the smooth transition from the dual to a single currency 
system as an argument for the quick abolition of all exchange controls.
   But RB governor Chris Stals' firm conviction is that South Africa 
must first prepare the way and lead the country into a situation where 
the lifting of exchange controls is a non-event.
   The million-dollar question is when does South Africa reach this 
situation. Some feel that reserves have improved sufficiently and the 
exchange rate stabilised satisfactorily that the time is now right to 
lift exchange controls.
   Stals has said it will take to 1997 or 1998. He notes that backlogs 
have built-up for international diversification in the asset structure 
of South African investors and is concerned about the huge pent-up 
demand with institutional investors and managers of portfolio funds for 
some diversification into foreign assets. 
   As a start, since July last year, the RB is allowing insurance 
companies, pension funds, and unit trusts to invest abroad if the 
investment is swapped by a foreign investment in South Africa, thus 
leaving no net loss of foreign exchange reserves. By mid-November, the 
RB had approved asset swaps worth R5,6- billion.
   The RB is also reducing its role in the forward foreign exchange 
market where it allows banks a greater role. The RB's share of forward 
transactions fell from 18,5% in July to 14,2% in September and its 
short-term forward book dropped by $5,7-billion from the end of March to 
the end of November.
   Stals' cautious approach is based on the presumption that South 
Africa must first ensure greater stability in the underlying market 
forces before entrusting the determination of important prices to market 
forces.
   The RB's exchange rate policy is still one of a floating exchange 
rate system operating within the constraints of certain foreign exchange 
controls. In this situation, it is extremely difficult to assess the 
rand's level.
   Stals notes that in a new global environment, where exchange rates 
are determined by volatile capital movements, the conventional concepts 
of over/under-valued currencies, based on the principle of purchasing 
power parity, have little meaning. In today's world the rand can easily 
appreciate as a result of capital inflows despite a growing deficit on 
the current account.
   Ultimately, net capital inflows and a stable exchange rate cannot be 
achieved or maintained through superficial intervention or controls. 
There is no alternative for sound monetary, fiscal and other macro-
economic policies. International capital markets will be the 
adjudicators of these policies.
   In this regard, South Africa has virtually fully normalised its 
international financial relations and cannot ignore the norms and 
standards for financial discipline.
   Over the past year, South Africa has re- established normal relations 
with multi- national bodies such as the United Nations and the World 
Bank, and joined various international regional bodies such as the 
Organisation of African Unity and the African Development Bank. The 
country obtained various international credit ratings which enabled it 
to raise new funds on the international capital markets.

South African Currency on the Rise

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   Johannesburg - The rand has stabilised remarkably compared to those 
heady days over 1985 to 1993 when it was in a free-fall against all the 
world's major currencies.
   There are numerous ways of looking at a currency's value.
   The best measure is to consider its nominal effective value. This is 
an index comprising a basket of currencies weighted according to the 
value of transactions South Africa does in that currency.
   The Reserve Bank's index, with a base of 100 in 1990, averaged 81,25 
in 1993, 73,71 in 1994 and 69,52 in 1995, a depreciation of six percent 
which is not that different from the gap in the inflation rate between 
South Africa and its major trading partners. The index is currently at 
70.
   The real effective exchange rate of the rand, which is the nominal 
value adjusted for producer price differentials between South Africa and 
its trading partners, has barely changed from 98,66 in January 1995 to 
98,57 in September (the last available figure). In 1994, it averaged 
97,18.
   Over 1995, the rand depreciated by only two percent against the US 
dollar (nine percent in 1994), five percent against the British pound 
(10%), 11% against the Japanese yen (18%) and 16% against the German 
mark (11%).
   Compared to May when the rand was at its year's low, the currency has 
actually appreciated against the dollar (from 3,7 to 3,64 this week), 
the pound (5,9 to 5,62) and the mark (2,66 to 2,51).
   The average daily turnover rose from $4- billion in the last quarter 
of 1994 to $4,9- billion in the second quarter of 1995 and $5,2-billion 
in the third quarter.

South Africa Faces Public Sector Strikes in 1996

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Rowan Callaghan

   Johannesburg - A report on strike action in 1995 has shown that, 
despite disastrous predictions, there were less strikes last year than 
in previous years.
   Compiled by Andrew Levy and Associates, the report said that the 1995 
level was the lowest since 1988. But the industrial relations 
consultancy does not expect the same to happen this year.
   "With the new Labour Relations Act there will be a tendency to test 
its boundaries and this will cause an increase in strike action. It will 
become easier to go on strike," says Andrew Sparks of Andrew Levy & 
Associates. 
   According to the report an estimated 1,6- million mandays -- the 
number of workers multiplied by the number of days on strike -- - were 
lost to strikes in 1995. In 1994 the amount of mandays was 3,9-million 
while in 1993 it was 3,6-million mandays. 
   The main trigger causing strike action was found to be disputes over 
wages, "indicating the wide gap between expectations and delivery".
   "I think the reason there have been fewer days lost is because it 
seems as if there is an increased maturity between both parties, 
management and unions," comments Sparks.
   This maturity is not yet evident in the public sector and among state 
parastatals where the majority of strike action took place. 
   Sparks attributes this in part to the fact that strikes in these 
sectors were only allowed recently and "both management and workers are 
therefore relatively new to the negotiating process". 
   He is confident, however, that the maturity in the private sector 
would eventually spread to the public sector.
   However, he predicts that most of the strike action this year will 
still take place in the public sector for some time to come.

Satellite Group Plans Pan-African Links

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Leon Perlman

   Johannesburg - South Africa recently hosted a special meeting for 
Rascom, a pan-African satellite organisation dedicated to providing 
Africa with its own satellite for relaying telephone, data and 
television signals.
   African countries are paying up to R1,5- billion a year through 
obligatory routing of intra-African telephony traffic through Europe. 
   The 120-delegate meeting in Cape Town provided the first detailed 
implementation plan for pooling African satellite requirements, 
currently spread over some 11 Intelsat satellites.
   With the substantial loss of first-world country business to high-
capacity fibre optic cabling, Africa is seen by satellite companies as 
the next revenue growth point. 
   The first Afrocentric Rascom satellite, the R750-million Intelsat 
804, is under construction by Lockheed and is scheduled to be launched 
in the first quarter of 1997. 
   This should be followed by the launch of the Intelsat 805. Both 
satellites are expected to be launched into orbit by Chinese Long March 
rockets. 
   The 804 will provide high-power coverage of the entire African 
continent, South America, parts of Europe and the Middle East, and even 
the east coast of the United States. 
   "We aim to pool African resources to create a network for 17 African 
countries for their domestic television, data and telephony needs. We 
believe that the best way for Africa to be developed is via a regional 
approach to be able to show a market big enough to attract regional as 
well as international players," Intelsat group director Hamadoun Toure 
told the delegates.
   But while the 804 would pool the capacity needs of African nations 
currently served by some nine Intelsat spacecraft, Toure says that some 
services will not be moved -- primarily because of the need for costly 
upgrades to earth station equipment. 
   The capacity on the 804 -- which is still under construction -- is 
already swamped and another satellite will be ordered. The 805 will be 
the first dedicated land-mass African satellite, orbiting in geo-
stationary orbit above Zaire. 
   Many of the Rascom delegates expressed concern about funding for the 
project. Intelsat requires a prepayment of more than US$200- million. 
   Telkom's presence at the meeting surprised many observers considering 
it is not an official Rascom signatory. 
   However, the three Telkom representatives all played an active part 
in the deliberations. Most of the capacity on the proposed 805 satellite 
has already been requested by Telkom. 
   This appears to dovetail with Telkom's plans to integrate its planned 
South Africa to Far East (SAFE) fibre cable with the intra-African 
Rascom 805 satellite network. 
   Telkom is likely to contribute handsomely in proportion to its usage 
of the 804 and 805 satellites. It is the largest Intelsat user in Africa 
by far. 
   Sources in Rascom say that South Africa's official entry into the 
organisation will occur within months, if not weeks. They say that these 
assurances have been already been given by Telkom chairman Dikgang 
Moseneke.

Benin
Voodoo Receives Official Nod

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   BENIN - Africa's traditional ancestor worship and appeasement of the 
spirits is now officially fashionable in the small West African nation 
of Benin.
   The government of President Nicephore Soglo declared January 11 a 
national holiday to mark the recognition of voodoo as a religion. Voodoo 
is a religion based on belief in witchcraft and magical rites.
   Westerners still refer to voodoo variously as a "cult", "culture", 
"animistic" or "paganism".
   The curtain-raiser to the installation of voodoo as an officially 
recognised religion was the "Ouidah 92", the first festival of voodoo 
culture and arts which took place from February 8 to 18, 1993 in Ouidah 
some 45 kilometers west of Benin's capital, Cotonou.
   At the time, the organisers of the international event which was 
opened by President Soglo, took care to suppress the religious basis of 
voodoo.
   He was accompanied by two high priests of voodoo - Sossa Guedehongue 
and Dagbo Hounon.  It was a carnival affair.
   At the inauguration of the festival, President Soglo emphasised that 
voodoo was the common link between Benin -- indeed the whole of the west 
coast of Africa that had provided the slaves during the era of slave 
trade -- and the black diaspora of the Americas and the Caribbean.  Many 
of the guests came from Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and West Africa.
   The President pointed out that at least 4 million out of Benin's 7.5 
million people worship ancestors or spirits at one time or another. 
Those are clearly staggering figures for a country that is regarded 
mainly Catholic, with Islam considered the second mainstream religion.
   Benin is a poor country whose economy was ruined by the misguided 
marxist military dictatorship of former ruler Matthew Kerokou.
   By 1990, 40,000 civil servants had not been paid their salaries for 
at least six months.  Yet by 1992/1993 so highly regarded was the voodoo 
festival that the government undertook to pay CFA francs 400 million (US 
dollars 800,000) of the CFA francs 800 million (US dollars 1.6 million) 
budget for the whole extravaganza.  France offered about CFA francs 100 
million.  The rest of the money came from the diaspora.
   Soglo claims 3 million Beninois or descendants of Beninois, migrated 
abroad either by the effects of slavery in the 18th Century or in later 
years.
   Voodoo preceded slavery on the west coast of Africa by three 
centuries.  The practice thrived in West Africa by the 15th century.
   Alan Anderson of the Centre for the Study of New religions in 
Birmingham, United Kingdom says Beninois are not alone in the practice 
of voodoo.
   "Voodoo is the traditional religion of West Africa," he emphasised. 
It was suppressed in the colonial period when it was equated with 
witchcraft and it continued to be sensationalised by magazines and 
Western writers in modern times.
   One of the prominent aspects of voodoo is appeasement of spirits 
through sacrificial offerings of children and domestic animals. 
Traditional liquor is offered as "libation" for the purpose.
   It is not yet clear how the Catholic Church in Benin views the latest 
developments.  Officially it has the largest number of followers of any 
one religion in the country.
   However it is interesting to note that the head of the Roman Catholic 
Church, Pope John Paul II, during his most recent visit to Africa last 
September, remarked about the similarity between the Communion with 
Saints in Catholicism and ancestor worship in African religions.
   Indeed, at the Resurrection Gardens in Nairobi, the Pope received an 
African traditional priest who officially blessed him.
   Dr. Anderson points out that African traditional religions are being 
revived in many places in Africa.  Very often, traditional religions and 
Christianity exist side by side in Africa.

Kenya
Milk Cooperative In Dire Straits

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI - The giant Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC), is broke and 
cannot pay farmers over Kshs.1.5 billion (US$.27 million) owed them for 
deliveries made since August 1994, the Minister for Agriculture, 
Livestock Development and Marketing Mr. Simeon Nyachae admitted in a 
press statement on January 16.
   Minister Nyachae noted that a total restructuring was necessary if 
KCC was to be rescued.  "There is need to re-formulate the future role 
of KCC in the short and long-term," Nyachae said in the press statement.  
"KCC continues to pay over Kshs.30 million (US$ 54,000) interest per 
month for its overdraft and farmers are not being paid," said the 
Minister.
   The Agriculture Minister added; "In the short-term , this would mean 
immediate selling of stocks to pay farmers and clear the overdraft, 
overhaul the management, and introduce a new pricing system to take care 
of both domestic and external markets."
   About the medium and long-term plans for saving KCC from imminent 
collapse Nyachae said that there was need to legally establish the 
status of KCC and "hand over the responsibility (of running it) to the 
original owners (farmers) who can decide to run it either as a co-
operative or a company."
   The giant dairy farmers' organisation is said to be holding rotting 
products worth Kshs.2.4 billion (US$50 million) in its store.  The items 
cannot be sold either locally or abroad due to "poor management and poor 
marketing strategies."
   A section of the local press reported that the "cash strapped Kenya 
Co-operative Creameries has in the past sabotaged private individuals 
out to market the company's products out."  It further said that the 
organisation was receiving 800,000 litres of milk daily but was able to 
sell only 500,000 litres, with the rest going to waste.
   Kenya Farmers Association (KFA) Chairman, Mr Mark Too also called for 
the immediate decentralization of the KCC.  He said that farmers and the 
public have been kept in the dark about the operations of KCC. "Previous 
directors used their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of 
farmers," he added.
   Since its inception in 1925, the Kenya Co-operative Creameries has 
grown to become a monopoly in dairy processing and distribution in 
Kenya.  Today, KCC is the oldest and largest co-operative society with 
more than 40,000 members in the country.  It operates 11 collecting 
centres, 11 processing factories and has workforce of well over 4,000 
employees.
   In 1968 the Kenya government rationalised milk distribution by 
withdrawing operating licenses from KCC's main competitors thus giving 
it monopoly.
   For the next decade KCC was rapidly expanded through provision of 
government loans and government guaranteed external loans.  In 1980, the 
company surplus reportedly started declining and in 1987 KCC started 
experiencing loses altogether.
   Between May 25, 1989 and August 9, 1991 KCC was managed by a 
government appointed management commission, following an outcry from 
dairy farmers about mismanagement of their organisation and an appeal 
from them to save it from imminent collapse.  The commission was also 
enjoined to write a prescriptive report which is yet to be made public.
   In the second half of 1994, KCC started experiencing serious 
financial and management problems and the government appointed a task 
force in May 1995 which has run the dairy firm to date under the parent 
Ministry of Co-operative Development.
   Meanwhile dairy farmers across the country have added their voices to 
the nationwide condemnation of KCC's management.  Dairy farmers from the 
North Rift region, one of the leading milk producing parts of the 
country, are reported to have "called for the total overhaul of KCC 
management and disbanding of the appointed Task Force."
   "The government should restructure KCC with the aim to streamline its 
operations to reduce overhead costs and have the current Task Force 
disbanded," Richard Barkoyet, one of the farmers' representatives said.
   Commenting on the cash strapped KCC, the Chairman of the Kenya 
Farmers' Association Mr. Mark Too said; "I can only compare KCC to a 
vehicle which veers off into a ravine.  You need a broader perspective 
to rescue what remained of it than the usual cranes."

Uganda
Cardinal Attacks Tax System

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   KAMPALA - The head of the Uganda Catholic Church Cardinal Emmanuel 
Wamala has attacked the country's tax authority saying it is "anti-
people".
   Speaking during the launching of the Catholic Church-owned Nsambya 
Hospital Development Fund in the Ugandan capital on January 15, Cardinal 
Wamala decried the "brutal high taxation of medicines and other 
essential Ugandan imports".
   Cardinal Wamala told Christians at the function presided over by 
President Yoweri Museveni; "Taxation should be aimed at improving the 
well being of common people --- but to tax medicines meant to save their 
lives is not only making their lives difficult but condemning them to 
death."
   Cardinal Wamala's remarks come at a time when the Ugandan business 
community is complaining about high tax rates in the basically import 
oriented economy of this East African country.
   The Chairman of Uganda Importers, Exporters and Traders Association 
Captain Mike Mukula, told President Museveni during a meeting he held 
with the association on January 16 that the Anti-Smuggling Unit of 
Uganda's tax body is so high-handed that it confiscates a loaf of bread 
from a poor Ugandan simply because he has bought it from neighbouring 
Kenya, where 90 per cent of Uganda's manufactured goods are imported 
from.
   But President Museveni defended his government's tax policy saying it 
is meant to protect up-coming Ugandan industries from foreign products.

between him and President Jerry Rawlings.
   The row between the two men, rooted in a split between the formerly 
allied political parties they respectively lead, came to a head when 
Arkaah accused Rawlings of punching him during a December 28 cabinet 
meeting.
   Rawlings has since repeatedly and publicly suggested that Ghana's 
parliament should find a way to get rid of Arkaah, but Arkaah has said 
he would not bow out voluntarily under any circumstances since the 
president has no power to sack him.
   But two dozen leaders from six religious bodies, including Ghana's 
Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Council of Independent Churches and 
the Federation  of Muslim Councils, met Arkaah on January 15 to work 
towards resolving the dispute.
   The delegation's spokesman and general secretary of the Christian 
Council of Ghana, David Asante Dartey, said the six bodies were very 
concerned about the rift and wanted to ensure the prevailing peace in 
the country is not threatened.
   Dartey commended Arkaah's prompt response to the delegation's request 
for an audience and said a similar request had been made to the 
president.
   "It is because of my love for peace and conviction in finding a 
lasting solution to the country's problems that I consented to meet the 
religious bodies," Arkaah said of the meeting.
   Before the alleged attack, Arkaah had claimed cabinet meetings were a 
focus for high-level corruption in Ghana.
   According to the official version of events, Rawlings did not assault 
the Vice-President, but simply pushed him to encourage his departure 
from the meeting on account of the insults he had allegedly made.
   The intervention by the religious leaders came shortly after Arkaah, 
who had accused Rawlings of punching him during the cabinet meeting, 
boycotted the opening of Parliament on January 12.
   "It would appear as if I offer myself as a punching bag to offer 
someone political enhancement," Arkaah said, referring to "insults" from 
Rawlings and his supporters which followed Arkaah's allegation that the 
President had punched him in full view of ministers during the December 
28 cabinet meeting.
   "Today's occasion was one only for the president to make a statement, 
just like last January 8 parade. I attended the parade and was subjected 
to a tirade of insults without the opportunity to exercise the right of 
reply, so I wanted to avoid a repetition," Arkaah said.
   During anniversary celebrations on January 8, Rawlings said of 
Arkaah:  "He tends to subvert the government from within."
   During his 90-minute address on January 12, Rawlings repeated a 
suggestion made on January 8 that Parliament should find a way to sack 
the vice president.

Burundi
Tutsi Extremists Bring Capital To A Standstill

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   BURUNDI - Extremists from Burundi's Tutsi minority brought business 
in the capital Bujumbura to a standstill on January 16, the second day 
of a strike launched to force President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya to 
resign.
   Despite a major deployment by crack army troops, residents of the 
troubled city appeared unwilling to go to work for fear of ethnic 
clashes, and banks, many offices and public services did not open their 
doors.
   The standstill was brought about without violence by a Tutsi 
movement, Youth Solidarity for the Defence of Minorities (SOJEDEM), led 
by Deo Niyonzima and Tutsi extremist organisations, which accuse 
Ntibantunganya, a Hutu in charge of a shaky coalition, of conniving with 
Hutu extremist gangs fighting a guerrilla war against the Tutsi- 
dominated army.
   With its turnout early last week the army clearly distanced itself 
from the extremists, but it is frequently accused of collaborating with 
them in the small central African highland nation, where relief workers 
estimate that ethnic killings claim about 30 lives every day.
   Hardliners in the main Tutsi opposition party, the Union for National 
Progress (UPRONA), had also planned to hold a demonstration in front of 
the party's headquarters, which were under tight military security.
   UPRONA radicals want their party to withdraw confidence in 
Ntibantunganya and pull out of the coalition and the national assembly, 
formed in September 1994 in a bid to stave off mass bloodletting between 
Tutsis and Hutus.
   Burundi, like neighbouring Rwanda, is a powderkeg where 50,000 people 
were massacred after the first elected Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, 
was killed in a foiled military coup in October 1993, which the then 
government survived.
   On January 15, diplomats said the authorities had put up a remarkably 
united front against the Tutsis, but the extremists gained ground the 
next day despite an overnight warning from Defence Minister, Lieutenant-
Colonel Firmin Sinzoyiheba, who said he put the Tutsi extremists in the 
same basket as "those who wreck bridges, sabotage power lines and water 
supplies -- all those whom we are fighting."
   For three months, Bujumbura has been without electricity and has also 
seen water stoppages caused by sabotage.  The Defence Minister called on 
the security forces, which have taken a battering from Hutu extremists 
in attacks to "act with firmness, lucidity and serenity".

Uganda
Commission To Probe Church Diocese

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   UGANDA - The Church of Uganda has set up a commission to probe the 
alleged mismanagement of funds in the south western Anglican Diocese of 
Mityana.
   The Bishop of the diocese, the Right Rev. Wilson Mutebi on January 16 
announced that the commission will investigate failure by the diocese to 
meet its financial obligations during the past seven years.
   "It will assist the church to find out whether the problem is with 
priests, Christians or the administration at the diocese" the Bishop 
said.
   He also announced the suspension of his diocesan secretary Rev. Canon 
Samuel Kamya who allegedly failed to account for US dollars 7,000.
   The bishop's revelations follow a recent declaration by Church of 
Uganda Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyoyo to the effect that the church 
would take action against "corrupt and inefficient bishops".
   Church of Uganda officials say this announcement by the Anglican 
Archbishop was facilitated by the amendment of the church's constitution 
"empowering" the Anglican prelate to discipline bishops in the wrong and 
take overall charge of the Church affairs.
   Anglican Christians here see the move as a result of widespread 
dissent in the church over alleged corruption and abuse of power by 
church officials.
   Although Archbishop Nkoyoyo did not cite any concrete examples, it is 
generally believed that he was targeting the Church of Uganda eastern 
diocese of Busoga where some Christians have accused their Bishop 
Cyprian Bamwoze of mismanagement of funds and church affairs.

Ethiopia
Rebels Broadcast From Former Soviet Union

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI -  A rebel Ethiopian group is using a radio transmitter in 
the former Soviet Union to broadcast propaganda against the Addis Ababa 
regime of Meles Zenawi.
   The transmissions are on shortwave frequencies and appear to have 
started in early January. According to a spokesman for the British 
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) East African radio monitoring facility in 
Nairobi, Kenya, the Oromo Liberation Front started the evening 
transmission early this year after the apparent discontinuation of their 
broadcasts from transmitters in the United States where they were first 
monitored last year.  Such broadcasts are illegal in the US.
   The BBC monitoring facility believes the radio station is based in 
the Ukraine "where there is a lot of spare transmission capacity at the 
moment."  The contact address for the station is given as Berlin, 
Germany.
   The shortwave signal is described as "good though somewhat noisy."
   The rebel station does not put out news broadcasts, though it carries 
strongly worded commentaries, critical of the government in Addis Ababa.  
Despite the mid-1995 devolution of power to the provinces that allowed 
the various regions in Ethiopia to enjoy autonomy, the radio accuses the 
Tigrean people - the tribe of the executive Prime Minister, Meles 
Zenawi, of taking the rest of the country for a ride.
   Some correspondence is also read on the radio.  One letter asked why 
there are no battle reports on the broadcasts giving information about 
the war waged in Oromia by the Oromo Liberation Front.  The presenter 
promised that battle reports should be expected in the near future.
   The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia (indeed in 
Africa) with a population of 30 million of Ethiopia's 55 million strong 
population.
   The geographical location of Oromia, (homeland of the Oromo) is 
southern Ethiopia.  It covers more than 500,000 square kilometres of the 
territory - double the size of the United Kingdom.
   Many Oromos say successive Ethiopian regimes dating back to 
Abyssinian King Menelik II, in the 1880s, looked down on or segregated 
Oromo people.

Zimbabwe
Catholic Church Refuses To Register Its Own 

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   HARARE - The Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe has refused to 
register its relief agency, the Catholic Development Commission (CADEC), 
under a controversial new law, the Zimbabwe News Agency (ZIANA) reported 
here on January 16.
   Church spokesman Oskar Wermter told ZIANA that Catholic bishops were 
unhappy that the new act, which sailed through parliament last year gave 
a cabinet minister absolute powers over non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) without providing any legal recourse.
   "The bishops are unhappy with the act, which gives the minister 
enormous powers and there is no legal redress," Wermter said.
   "Voluntary organisations cannot defend themselves even if the 
minister receives false information.  Natural justice demands that there 
is recourse to law," he added.
   The church warned that if it is pressurised to register, it will 
challenge the matter in court to determine the constitutionality of the 
Private Voluntary Organisations Act, an amendment of the 1974 Welfare 
Act designed to monitor NGOs.
   When the bill was  enacted, many NGOs were concerned but reacted 
cautiously, though of late some have openly criticised the act, which 
puts them under the direct scrutiny of the government.
   The Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (ZIMRIGHTS) last month said 
that the act went far beyond legitimate oversight of NGOs by the 
government, threatening their independence and opening the way to 
governmental abuse and corruption.
   ZIMRIGHTS said the new law allowed the Public Service, Labour and 
Social Welfare Minister to take over the running of NGOs on a number of 
"vague and ill-defined" grounds.
   The human rights organisation said that members of NGOs could now 
easily be "suppressed" for criticising actions taken by the government 
and the new law "is intended to serve as a club against outspoken NGOs 
in the future."
   A number of international NGOs operate in Zimbabwe, providing relief 
and development programmes.
   Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's former Prime Minister Bishop Abel Muzorewa 
launched his campaign for the March presidential elections on January 17 
with a vitriolic attack on President Robert Mugabe, likening him to "a 
cruel, drunken father."
   Muzorewa, 71, who was prime minister briefly before independence in 
1980, said he had returned to active politics because he was "shocked 
and heartbroken by the abortion of our independent nationhood at the 
hands of Mugabe and his associates."
   He accused Mugabe and his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union- 
Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party of "instilling fear among people of all 
races in Zimbabwe, so that they now live and behave like rats that have 
been chased by cats all day."
   Muzorewa is one of only two challengers who have announced their 
intention to run against Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly 16 
years.  The other is the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, who faces trial in 
February on charges of plotting to kill Mugabe and overthrow the 
government.
   All three men, in their 70s, are veterans of the nationalist struggle 
that ousted the white-minority government of Ian Smith in the 1970s.
   Sithole's ZANU-Ndonga party currently holds two seats in the 150-seat 
parliament, while Muzorewa will be standing as a candidate for the 
United Parties (UP), a coalition of opposition groups which has no MPs.
   Muzorewa, a Methodist bishop and conservative politician, served in 
parliament for four years after independence but was arrested in 1984 on 
security charges.
   He was released before elections in 1985, but after his party failed 
to secure a single seat he quit politics. Speaking on January 17 at a 
news conference here which was packed with his supporters but with 
government-controlled television noticeably absent, Muzorewa said 
corruption and mismanagement since independence had plunged Zimbabwe 
into the "worst poverty and worst unemployment ever experienced."
   Muzorewa pointed to Mugabe's recent salary increase of 100 per cent 
at a time of economic hardships and steep rises in the cost of staple 
foodstuffs as a sign of the government's arrogance and insensitivity.

Kenya
Methodist Church Consecrates First Woman Bishop

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   NAIROBI - The Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones made history on January 14 
by becoming the first woman bishop in the African continent.
   She was consecrated Bishop of the Methodist Church in Kenya at St. 
Peter's Methodist Church, Langata, in the outskirts of Kenya's capital, 
Nairobi.  The ceremony was conducted by Presiding Bishop of the 
Methodist Church in Kenya, Bishop Zablon Nthamburi.
   Bishop Jones, who was born in the small town of Stamford, 
Lincolnshire, England on May 24, 1939, arrived in Kenya in January 1969 
as a lay woman worker.  She was initially based in the Tana River and 
Lamu Districts in the Coastal Province.
   Rev. Jones recalls that she worked with women and children in that 
region "in the field of development, both physical and spiritual."
   After five years of service she proceeded to St. Paul's United 
Theological College, Limuru, to help in the training of pastors' wives.  
In 1976 she went for theological training "and preparation for the 
ordained ministry" at Bristol College in the United Kingdom.
   Rev. Jones returned to Kenya at the invitation of the Methodist 
Church of Kenya in July 1979, served as a minister on probation for one 
year and was ordained in the "ministry of Word and Sacrament" in June 
1980.
   She served as a minister at the Kariokor Methodist Church up to 1985. 
In 1986 she was transferred to Kariji Circuit in Pwani (Coast) Synod 
where she worked for the next seven years.  In 1993 she was transferred 
to the Langata Circuit.
   Asked what she felt after beating three other male contestants, Rev. 
Jones told APS; "To be honest, I did not expect it....I am very moved 
and very honoured."
   A congregant pointed out that Rev. Jones garnered the 83 votes, half 
of all the votes cast because "she is very dedicated to her work and 
very sensitive to the needs of her congregation."
   Rev. Jones said that working as a bishop, and particularly as a white 
female bishop among blacks does not make her feel discriminated against.  
"I have lived with these people for many years and I have never felt 
discriminated against," she added.
   The history of the Methodist Church in Kenya goes back 133 years when 
three missionaries of the United Methodist Free Churches arrived in the 
country.  Thomas Wakefield, James Woolner and Dr. Ludwig Krapf planted 
the first Methodist Church at Rabai, on Kenya's coast in July 1882.
   Later, the church moved to the interior of Kenya arriving in Meru, 
Eastern province in 1910.  In 1967 the Methodist Church of Kenya became 
autonomous.  Soon after, it opened missions in Northern Kenya (1967), 
Western Kenya (1973) and Kwale-Coast- (1977).
   In 1994 the church launched an insurance brokerage firm and is 
currently in the process of establishing a full fledged university. The 
Methodist Church in Kenya has a following of some 650,000 faithful.
   Before coming to Kenya, Rev. Maureen Elizabeth Jones trained and 
worked as a social worker in the United Kingdom.  She says that she 
worked "with deprived and disabled children" for 11 years. "I have a 
great love for young people and this has very much influenced the shape 
of my ministry here in Kenya," she told APS.

Chad
Peace Talks Collapse

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   FRANCEVILLE, GABON - Round-table talks on the political future of 
Chad ended in failure here on January 9 after most of the armed rebel 
groups present refused to sign a framework document to end civil strife 
and install a democratic system in Chad.
   Gabonese President Omar Bongo was forced to put an end to the meeting 
late on January 9 after the document failed to win enough backing.
   "Since you say 'No' then I want the discussions to stop there," Bongo 
told participants at the meeting, which finally started on January 6, 
six hours late, with the aim of ending 30 years of civil war in Chad and 
bringing the Chadian rebels into the democratisation and election 
process now underway.
   The meeting grouped representatives of the Chadian government, legal 
political parties, trade unions, various associations and armed 
opposition groups, plus mediators and international observers.
   The final document was read out to the participants by Gabonese 
Foreign Minister Casimir Oye Mba, then signed by Bongo, Chadian 
President Idriss Deby and President Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central 
African Republic and Mahamane Ousmane of Niger.
   Most of the 12 representatives of legalised parties signed the text, 
but some abstained along with several representatives of associations 
and trade unions.
   But out of the 15 armed opposition groups present, 13 refused to 
sign, while the two groups which signed were a faction of the Movement 
for Democracy and Development represented by Moussa Medella and a 
recently-created group called AFUD, about which no information was 
available.
   Most of the opposing groups wanted detailed discussions between them 
before a text could be agreed on and signed, contrary to signing a 
document followed by discussions.
   But when some of the rebel participants called for the resignation of 
Chadian President Deby, Bongo accused them of coming to Franceville "to 
sabotage the round-table talks."
   Bongo's text had called on all signatories to renounce use of force 
to conquer and keep power and appealed to them to uphold democratic 
processes as the only path to a lasting political settlement in Chad.
   It also called for immediate ceasefire and amnesty, for armed groups 
to be transformed into political parties and for defence and security 
forces to be reorganised "along republican lines."
   The meeting was originally scheduled for last December but had to be 
postponed amid disagreements over the participants from the Chadian 
side.  All 58 legal political parties in the country wanted to be 
represented as did the guerrilla groups, which total 15 according to 
Chadian Prime Minister Djimasta Koibla.  Chad has a population of some 
5.5 million people.
   Finally it was agreed that the political parties would be grouped, 
sharing a total of 10 representatives.  Some protested, demanding a 
greater role, but none refused to take part.
   The Gabonese government sent envoys to Chad itself, to Benin, Libya 
and Algeria to involve the armed groups, while Djimasta Koibla visited 
Chad's neighbours, including the Central African Republic, Cameroon and 
Nigeria.
   The Chadian Premier said the government's aim was to get the external 
opposition leaders to return to the country and take part in the normal 
political process.

Sierra Leone
Ousted Leader Flown To Guinea

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)

   FREETOWN - Military head of State Captain Valentine Strasser of 
Sierra Leone was ousted in a palace coup on January 16 and replaced by 
his deputy and armed forces chief.
   Reports say the 29-year-old Strasser was immediately flown by 
helicopter to neighbouring Guinea (in handcuffs), together with his wife 
and children.  Captain Strasser now joins the man he overthrew at the 
end of April 1992, former President Joseph Momoh, who also lives in 
exile in Guinea.
   Meanwhile, the Sierra Leonean government has asked Ghana to grant 
Captain Strasser political asylum and Ghanaian authorities say the 
request is under consideration.  Sierra Leone state radio announced that 
the new leader Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, has imposed a dusk to dawn 
curfew.
   Another report says the new leader of the National Provisional Ruling 
Council (NPRC) has sacked all government officials seen to be actively 
involved in party politics.
   Director of Defence Information, Lieutenant Colonel Karifa Kargbo, 
who made the radio announcement, accused Strasser of wanting to cling to 
power.  "Captain Strasser has been removed from office and has safely 
left these shores due to his blatant attempts to implement legislation 
intended to be harmful to the democratic process," Kargbo was quoted 
saying.
   Although diplomats remain sceptical of Brigadier Bio's motive, the 
new NPRC leader has announced in his first national radio broadcast that 
elections scheduled for February 26 will go ahead as planned to return 
the country to democratic civilian rule.
   He also called on the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Foday 
Sankoh, which has been fighting the government since 1991, to come to 
the negotiating table without pre-conditions.  Brigadier Bio promised 
the rebels a general amnesty and urged them to participate in the 
forthcoming elections.

Zambia
Society Campaigns For Widow's Rights

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by APS Correspondent

   Nairobi - Most human beings are somehow familiar with the feeling of 
utter loss when a family loses a beloved member.  But not every bereaved 
family experiences the combined anguish of the absence of a breadwinner 
and disappearance of family property, thanks to practices that demand 
that relatives also "inherit" movable belongings left behind by the dead 
person.  Widows in Zambia, under the umbrella of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church have formed a society that is fighting for the rights of widows, 
widowers and their children.
   For Charity Changwe, there was nothing wrong with the decision made 
by her in-laws to shift the funeral gathering of her late husband from 
her flatlet in Kamenza township to the residence of the deceased's elder 
brother in the mine township, about two kilometres away in the same 
Zambian town of Chililabombwe.
   After  all, like other countries in Africa, it is a common tradition 
among Zambian communities to hold lugubrious meetings at the house of 
the eldest member of the surviving family in a given locality.  In 
addition, the company flatlet Changwe shared with her late husband, 
Chris, a surveyor with the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) 
at the time of his death in hospital on June 26, 1993, was unsuitable 
for the funeral gathering which demands a log-fire in the yard.
   But little did Changwe know she had been tricked.  For, on return to 
her flatlet a week after interring Chris at Kakoso Cemetery, she found 
all the goods missing from the house.  She could not believe the sight 
of her house which now resembled a playground.
   Sofasets, dinning table and chairs, a fridge, two beds and 
mattresses, and other household goods were no longer there.  She was 
heart broken for the second time in a week.
   "I learnt later that on June 29 while we were burying Chris,some men 
went to the house with a lorry and took all the goods.  My neighbours 
thought I was shifting from the flat since my husband had passed away," 
Changwe told a stunned seminar on the plight of widows and their 
children, held recently in Chililabombwe about 400 kilometres north of 
the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
   To date, she has never seen the goods and efforts to recover anything 
including the fridge bought from her earnings as a ZCCM mine police 
constable, failed.
   But this young widow is not alone in her predicament.  Many in this 
Southern African country continue to endure untold suffering at the 
hands of in-laws, despite the enactment by Parliament of the Laws of 
Intestate Succession Act and the Wills and Administration of Testate 
Estates Act, aimed at protecting widows, widowers and their surviving 
children after the death of their bread winner.
   According to the Intestate Succession Act which deals with the 
distribution of property in a situation where the deceased left no will, 
the widow or widower is entitled to 20 per cent of the property, 50 per 
cent goes to the children, the other 20 per cent to the deceased's 
parents while the remaining ten per cent is given to the dependants, who 
in this case is the person or persons who are/were maintained by the 
deceased immediately before death.
   The Wills and Administration of Testate simplifies the making of a 
will and provides for adequate financial and other provisions to be made 
in a will.
   However, the continued suffering of widows and their children is the 
concern of many sympathisers in Zambia and more so fellow women who 
congregate under the Women Missionary Society of the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Chililabombwe.
   With funds from America's Southern University Democratic Governance 
Project, the women have launched a public awareness campaign "aimed at 
conscietising the general public and challenging every wing of society 
through seminars to join in the campaign to fight against wide-spread 
property grabbing and ill-treatment of widows and orphans," says 
campaign co-ordinator, Rev. Paul Bupe.
   Rev. Bupe says no matter how some people might try to justify this 
scourge of ill-treatment of widows, the practice remains evil in the 
eyes of God.
   "This cruel act is condemned from the religious point of view.  What 
the Bible has established let no culture or tradition change, says Bupe 
who supports his statement by quoting from Exodus 22:22:24 in which God 
disapproves the act:  "Do not ill-treat any widow or orphan, if you do, 
I, the Lord will answer them when they cry out to me for help and I will 
be angry and kill you.  Your wives will become widows and your children 
will be fatherless."
   Ironically, according to Rev. Bupe's observations, Christians are in 
the forefront in disobeying God's ruling, in most cases on a woman- 
against-woman basis.
   It is the women who make widows crawl on their knees on hard ground 
for a long distance and smear them with mud and mealie meal (paste from 
maize meal) on the eve of the burial of their late spouses. Helpless 
widows are abused in the name of cleansing, God forbid with HIV lurking.
   Opening the seminar, Deputy - Mayor of Chililabombwe, Mr. Curp Mwaba 
said lack of public information on the law of succession is responsible 
for the suffering of widows.
   "Property grabbing and other forms of ill-treatment of widows is as 
cancerous as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and must also 
equally receive corresponding attention," Mr. Mwaba said.
   Seminar participants had different views when they cited poverty as 
one of the causes of property grabbing.  "Many people have turned the 
death of a relative to be a means of gain.  Like vultures, relatives 
wait patiently for the demise of a wealthy kin in order to share all his 
property at the expense of the widow and orphans," a participant said.
   Some said jealous sisters of the deceased often exhibit the most 
hostile attitude towards the widow because they think they are closer to 
their brother and regard the widow as a stranger.  Such sisters seize 
the opportunity at funerals to vent out their revenge on the hapless 
widow especially when she did not receive them well and cared for them 
when their brother was alive.
   Another argued that the situation can be unpleasant in cases where 
marriages of the sisters were not stable whereas that of the deceased 
brother was smooth.  It is worse in strained marital relations whereby 
the widow ends up being blamed for the death of her husband. This is 
worsened by the belief that "culture demands" that the widow be 
mistreated.
   However, the participants were unanimous that there is no specific 
yardstick for mistreating widows.  They singled out ignorance about the 
law of succession among the victims, perpetrators and the law 
enforcement officers as being major contributing factors to the problem.
   As Changwe admits; "I had no idea at the time of my husband's death 
that laws exist in Zambia to protect widows.  Otherwise, I should have 
taken the matter to the magistrates court for redress after the police 
turned me away saying the issue was civil and that it should be dealt 
with domestically between my family and in-laws."
   And, considering that she was five-months pregnant with her first 
born child, Changwe also feared she would prematurely lose this valuable 
gift from God in questionable circumstances.  She felt unsafe to 
antagonise her in-laws over her goods.
   "Although I was neither physically harassed nor sexually abused, fear 
of witch-craft grew in intensity when my pregnancy went beyond nine 
months.  I gave birth to a baby girl in the eleventh month," she 
revealed.
   In his contribution to the debate, Chililabombwe Magistrate, Mr. 
Kaengele Mulenga criticised the conduct of the law enforcement officers 
for displaying ignorance about the law of succession when they are 
supposed to be knowledgeable.
   "In many cases, the police turn away victims reporting the loss of 
their property believing the matter is of civil nature.  This is not the 
case as this is a criminal offence which carries custodial sentences for 
the guilty," he said.
   According to Mr. Mulenga, a person found guilty under the law of 
succession can either be fined a maximum of Kwacha 500,000 (about US 
dollars 590) or get a jail sentence of three years with hard labour or 
both fine and imprisonment as the court might determine.
   He suggested that police officers under-go orientation courses on 
succession statutes in order for them to deal with widows' complaints 
fairly.
   Seminar participants who included civil servants, mine and Zambia 
police officers, the clergy and widows also blamed weak and biased 
administrators in the distribution of property and corrupt local court 
justices for the disparities in the dispensation of cases of this 
nature.
   "When a family has a principled and well respected person, very often 
the administration of property is done according to the law and the 
widow is protected and cared for," they observed.
   Unlike other widows, Changwe's employment as a mine police constable, 
helped her recover from the shock of losing her property. She is now 
happily settled in a two-bedroomed ZCCM house in the mine township 
raising her daughter now aged over two years.
   Her advice to potential widows is: "Be brave and have no fear of 
witch-craft.  Take property-grabbing in-laws to court if need be." Some 
timely advice indeed.

Angola
Combatants Agree On Troop Encampment

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by APS Correspondent

   Luanda - After two-months break in the Angolan peace process, coupled 
with several incidents of ceasefire violations, the Angolan government 
and UNITA rebels have taken a major step forward with an agreement on 
the new composition of the army and the encampment of their excess 
guerrilla forces.
   More than 26,000 soldiers of the former rebel Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement will be integrated into a new 
Angolan defence force of some 90,000 men.  Of the 63,000 ex- guerrillas 
in Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, 26,000 will join the new army, 200 the air 
force and 100 the navy.
   The figure, announced in the Angolan capital, Luanda on January 15, 
was decided on at meetings in the past week between members of the 
general staff of UNITA and the regular armed forces of President Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos' ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola (MPLA) government.
   Both UNITA and MPLA, protagonists in Angola's civil war for almost 
two decades since independence from Portugal in 1975, agreed that other 
soldiers in their ranks -- some 180,000 men -- will not be demobilised 
immediately but assigned to a new force responsible for rebuilding 
civilian and military infrastructure destroyed during the bitter 
conflict.
   The UNITA fighters named to the new defence force in line with a 
peace pact signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, will be selected 
once all the former rebels have been disarmed and encamped in 15 sites 
prepared for them under the United Nations' supervision.
   Negotiations on the structure of the future army and the distribution 
of posts will continue.  The Luanda government has offered UNITA six 
places on the general staff of the defence force, including that of 
deputy chief-of-staff, a government source said.
   The UNITA representative on the joint peace commission established 
with the government, Isaias Samakuva, on January 15 went to Bailundo, 
the movement's headquarters town in central Angola, to consult with 
Savimbi on Luanda's proposals.
   The resumption of military talks is expected to lead to progress in 
the encampment operation, although no timetable has been fixed.  "We are 
not yet in a position to confirm the beginning of this operation," a 
UNITA delegation member said.
   On January 12, UNITA declared that it will free all prisoners of war 
(POWs) it is still holding, a joint commission for verifying peace in 
the southern African state said.
   The release of the POWs -- both military and civilian -- was due to 
be supervised from this week by the International Committee of the Red 
Cross, (ICRC) sources said, but did not give the exact number involved.  
The government has so far released 341 prisoners, while UNITA has freed 
20.
   A timetable aimed at putting the Angola peace effort back on a firm 
track was reached "formally" at a meeting on January 12 between 
representatives of the rebel group and the joint commission.  It 
requires
   UNITA to bring back to their bases its combatants in three locations 
-- Negage and Quibaze, both in the north, and Londiibali, in the centre 
of the country -- by January 20.
   The government, meanwhile, is to remove its troops to barracks in 
Uije and Bengo provinces, both in the north, according to the timetable 
which was proposed by the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM).
   The talks had gone on hold after clashes between fighters from both 
sides in the north, threatening the success of a peace plan signed in 
November 1994.  UN sources in Luanda said a list of UNITA officials who 
would be part of a new Angolan government of national unity would be 
discussed at the next meeting between President dos Santos and the UNITA  
leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The United Nations did not say when the meeting would take place, but 
Angolan radio said it could be held before January 20.  Since the Lusaka 
peace accord was signed in 1994, UNITA and MPLA have met three times in 
Zambia, Gabon and Belgium.
   Under the Lusaka peace accord, which ended 20 years of civil war in 
the sprawling former Portuguese colony, the Ministers of Geology and 
Mines, Trade, Health and Tourism are to be UNITA officials.
   Also reserved for the rebel group are seven vice-ministerial 
positions, including Defence, Interior, Finance and Agriculture, plus 
three provincial governorships and six ambassadorial posts.
   The former rivals are also due to discuss the repatriation of 
mercenaries they employed during the war.  Last week, the government 
sent home 460 South Africans who had been fighting on its side, but 
UNITA claims that Luanda had employed a total of 5,000.
   The move forward in the peace process comes as the head of the UN 
Security Council sought to boost the peace process in Angola by urging 
President dos Santos and the UNITA opposition leader to meet soon 
without conditions.
   "I appeal strongly to you to build upon progress made in negotiations 
in the past few days and to do everything necessary to resolve the 
outstanding issues which are blocking the peace process in Angola," 
Britain's Sir John Weston wrote on behalf of the 15-member council.
   The council expressed "serious concern about reports of continued 
violations of the ceasefire" as well as slow progress on practical 
implementation of obligations of peace agreements.
   The council said it was expecting a response from the two men via 
United States ambassador to the Untied Nations Madeleine Albright who 
was about to set out on a visit to Africa.  That response as well as 
concrete actions will be "critical factors" as the council considers the 
possible renewal of the 6,400-man UN mission next month.
   On January 4, 50 people were killed in southern Angola during a dawn 
attack by rebels from the UNITA movement, the governor of the province 
of Huila Kundi Payama announced in a statement carried by the official 
Angolan News Agency (ANGOP) monitored in Lisbon the same day.
   In the statement, Kundi said that an unknown number of rebels from 
UNITA took part in the attack on the town of Chivulo, located in Huila 
province, where the military situation had escalated in recent weeks 
following the return to the area of a UNITA leader.
   The incident came just as the Angolan government and former rebel 
leaders from the UNITA movement resumed negotiations a day earlier on 
setting up a national army in line with the November 1994 Lusaka peace 
accord.
   The talks resumed following an emergency meeting in Luanda on January 
2 between UN special envoy to Angola Alioune Blondin Beye and 
representatives from the government and UNITA.
   UN officials said that during the meeting, the UN also denounced the 
Angolan government for allowing one of the army units to capture the 
town of Kitoke in Uije province during the Christmas holidays.
   The incident neither claimed any victims nor sparked any clashes with 
UNITA soldiers, the officials added.
   Clashes between the two sides in recent months had raised fears about 
the country's commitment to the Lusaka Peace Accord, under which rebels 
were to disarm and both sides were to quarter soldiers before merging 
into a new national army.
   On December 8, US President Bill Clinton also warned President dos 
Santos, during a visit to Washington that ceasefire violations in the 
battle-scarred African nation could jeopardise its improving ties with 
the United States.

Uganda
NGOs Call For Donor Pressure

All Africa Press Service
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Crespo Sebunya

   Kampala - Much has been said about Uganda rising from ruins to become 
a showcase of a positive economic recovery programme.  But non- 
governmental organisations here say the same donors who are praising 
this East African country for its overall statistical progress, should 
now pressurize the government to address itself to the plight of 
millions of ordinary Ugandans who are wallowing in poverty.
   Residents of Kyotera town some 160 km south of Uganda's capital, 
Kampala held their breath as tens of military tanks rumbled through 
their dusty town, wrecking the just tarmacked section of a highway that 
leads into neighbouring Tanzania.
   Military authorities say that some 84 tanks were imported through 
Tanzania last November, a sign of increasing scale of Ugandan armament 
programme which is worrying donors who now say the programme accounts 
for more than 30 per cent of the country's budget.
   The collision course between Ugandan government and the donors over 
defence is not very difficult to discern.  The government explains that 
security needs are back on the high table because the country feels 
besieged by hostile neighbours.
   President Yoweri Museveni recently said that there are only two 
countries in the region he is on talking terms with -- Rwanda and 
Tanzania.  He suspects that other countries harbour rebel groups bent on 
destabilising Uganda.  "These countries fear a repeat of the type of 
revolution that happened in Uganda in their countries," Museveni has 
been quoted saying.
   He also believes that beefed up security also guarantees the welfare 
of investors.  To date, Uganda's Investment Authority has recorded 
nearly US dollars 2.5 billion but only 10 per cent of the amount has 
been actually invested in the country.  Among the reasons given for 
holding back is the uncertainty of this East African country's political 
situation.
   Uganda has however assured "doubting Thomases" that her 
demobilisation programme would result in a decline in defence spending.  
When the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took power in 1986, it built 
up a force of nearly 130,000 soldiers.  Then, the government reasoned 
that it had many enemies to fight. At one time 14 rebel groups were 
operating in the country.  Thus the high defence spending was tolerated.  
And as the number of rebel groups was scaled down and the government 
started demobilising its troops, there was a sigh of relief.
   The troops were reduced down to 50,000 and correspondingly defence 
spending went down.  According to the latest parliamentary report 
covering the 94/95 financial year, defence spending had dropped to 8 per 
cent of the national budget.  But then it is picking up again and 
according to latest figures from the United Nations Children's Fund 
(UNICEF), spending on defence has gone back to 30 per cent.
   But the government says there is need to modernise the army.  Mr. 
Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's Defence Minister is of the opinion that the army 
is now faced with well armed rebels and therefore needs to improve its 
efficiency.
   He notes that the country has to be guarded against external threat, 
especially from Sudan where both former President Idi Amin's soldiers 
under the West Nile Bank Front and Joseph Kony's rebel Lord Resistance 
Army (LRA) are based.
   But many concerned Ugandans believe defence is eating up resources 
which would otherwise have gone to the improvement of the people's 
welfare.  Both donors and non-governmental organisation are also worried 
about the trend in a country whose population is increasingly wallowing 
in poverty and disease, and want donors to do something about it.
   At a poverty alleviation conference held last November in Uganda, the 
NGOs said that some form of pressure ought to be put on the government 
so that it responds to the needs of the people.
   "The Ugandan government should be made to accept highest social 
conditionalities in form of higher budget allocation in health and 
education," Gary Bercker, one of the resource persons at the meeting 
said.
   He said that out of the country's 18 million people, 13 million live 
below the poverty line.  About 76 per cent of the 2.2 million pupils who 
enter primary schools do not complete seven years of education and only 
three per cent make it to university.
   Mr. Bercker said donors can prevail upon the government to address 
the increasing levels of poverty in the country.  "Poverty reduction is 
still an after-thought and not an integral part of the government policy 
formulation," he said.
   Bercker's concern is shared by the 1400 NGOs operating in Uganda. 
They say there are many intangible causes of insecurity in the country, 
especially when the population is dissatisfied with what they get from 
the government.
   NGOs, most of whom interact with one another and with the people, 
have proved to be spokespersons for the population.  They have served as 
an alternative to the government in availing the much needed services, a 
quality that puts them in a better position to understand what are 
likely to be causes of social conflicts.
   Social disruptions and discontent have increasingly been demonstrated 
through industrial strikes, especially by government workers.  Most 
dramatic was the strike by doctors who felt that their demand for better 
pay among other conditions has not been met.  Railway workers and 
teachers too have expressed their grievances through similar 
demonstrations.
   "The government should look into the issue of equity which requires 
that the distribution of benefits from growth must be addressed, if the 
poor are not to be further marginalised," Dr. Fred Opio, the Makerere 
University Executive Director for Economic Policy Research said.  His 
concern was that the government is yet to show commitment to the plight 
of the poor at a time when there are increasingly huge sums of money 
saved from the ongoing economic reform programmes.
   A statistical bulletin released by the Ministry of Finance in June 
1995 says Uganda saved up to US dollars 100 million in programmes such 
as the retrenchment of 148,000 civil servants.  The publication also 
notes that the privatisation programme allowed the country to collect 
nearly US dollars 90 million through privatisation receipts.
   It was hoped that this money would be utilised in the improvement of 
much needed services.  For instance, the World Bank says that the Uganda 
Electricity Board (UEB) is in great financial distress.  The board needs 
US dollars 100 million annually to be able to extend its services to the 
different areas of the country.
   But then, this should have been possible if the monies saved from the 
privatisation were applied to improve these services.  But when the 
report on privatisation was read, it was discovered that some of the 
money has been lent to private investors who have bought some of the 
companies, much to the annoyance of the parliamentarians.
   Nevertheless the government says that it has embarked on four 
measures to improve public resource expenditure.  The Minister for 
Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Joash Mayanja Nkangi says 
the government has already established a medium term expenditure 
framework where all sectors are involved in preparation of the budget.
   He says the application of these measures will see the budget share 
of the health sector rise from the current 12.1 to 15.4 per cent in the 
next financial year (96/97) while that of education will move from 17.9 
to 22.6 per cent in the same period.
   He also points out that the government has redesigned its priority 
programmes to serve as many people as possible.  "Before 1991, health 
expenditure skewed towards high cost hospital services that tended to 
benefit the few, while education was skewed towards secondary and 
tertiary institutions," he explained.  Now special attention will be 
paid to primary health care, rural water supply and primary education.
   Although these measures have taken hold, it would be long before 
tangible improvements are seen.  For instance, the per capita 
expenditure on health has risen to only US dollars 8 while the accepted 
standard is US dollars 12.  So far NGOs feel that pressure has to be put 
on the government so that it does not backslide.
   And their prayers were partly answered when donors asked the 
government to use money saved from relief programmes in the social 
sector.
   A debt management programme drawn by experts from the Bank of Uganda 
and an international team of experts from the newly created Eastern and 
Southern African Initiative in Debt and Reserves Management (ESAIDARM), 
World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) introduced two new components in the debt management programme.  
Through the programme, up to US dollars 20 million of the debt will be 
converted into local currency and be invested in social and 
environmental sectors.
   At the same time, donors have agreed to establish a multi-lateral 
debt fund where donors will avail unspecified balance of payment support 
to the government to offset amounts owed to multilateral institutions 
like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and African 
Development Bank (ADB).  The fund which is being supported by Denmark, 
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland among others, will release more 
funds to the social sector instead of having the same directed to 
servicing the external debt.
   According to government estimates, multilateral debt servicing 
accounts for up to 30 per cent of the national budget.  But it is 
expected that the new measures will reduce this by half to between 11 
and 12 per cent annually.  To ensure that the Ugandan government follows 
the plan, donors are expected to review the debt programme on a 
quarterly basis.
   But then, this is only part of the answer.  There are strong feelings 
especially in Uganda, among government opponents that the authorities in 
Kampala need to be more reconciliatory to neighbours.
   "It was wrong to sever diplomatic relationship with Sudan for this 
closed all avenues towards peaceful resolution of the conflict," said 
Mr. Paul Kawanga Semogerere, an aspiring presidential candidate.
   This subject also elicits some form of sympathy among senior 
government officials.  Mrs Betty  Bigombe, the Minister in charge of 
Pacification of the north said that when all is said and done, 
negotiations are still part of the answer.
   "It is very difficult to police our long stretch of the border we 
share with Sudan, thus it may be through negotiations that peace can be 
achieved," she emphasised.

Zambia
Africa Cup Games Drug Free

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - Games being played at the Africa Cup of Nations in 
South Africa have been declared as drug free, ten days before the close 
of the competition. Organising committee  chairman Dr Peter Matsheke 
said on Friday in a press statement: "So far all players have been 
clean." He explained that each of the four venues has a centre where the 
tests are being carried.
   "At half time, the match commissioners and team officials of the two 
competing teams randomly select two players from each team by drawing 
two numbers per team out of a bag," Dr Matsheke said, adding: "The 
players are identified 15 minutes from the centre by their team 
officials and doctors where the taking of samples is administered by a 
CAF appointed doctor." According to Dr. Matsheke, the players are 
allowed to choose the containers for their samples.
   "These containers are coded and only the secretary general of CAF, 
Mustapha Fahmy, knows the identities of the players when he receives the 
results between 36 and 48 hours after the tests are carried out," 
explained Dr. Matsheke.
   The samples are being tested at the University of Bloemfontein which 
according to Dr. Matsheke "is the only international Olympics committee 
(IOC) accredited laboratory in Africa."
   During Zambia's game against Algeria, Zeddy Saileti and Harrison 
Chongo were picked for testing and have since been cleared.
   Meanwhile, Zambia could still get in the quarter-finals with one 
point from the tie against Sierra Leone on Wednesday night in the Group 
B Africa Cup of Naions finals here.
   But no such thought is being entertained by coach Roald Poulsen or 
his 22- man squad who says no chances were going to be taken and his 
players were going to go for the kill to top the group.
   "Our aim is to win and end at the top of the group,"declared Poulsen. 
"We will put all our energies into the game." He added: "The boys know 
what is at stake. They will go out for an outright win."
   Combative winger, Jonson Bwalya agreed.  " Our aim is to beat Sierra 
Leone convincingly so that we top the table in group B and stay in 
Bloemfontein," he said. "Sierra Leone is a good team. we have to respect 
them," warned Jonson. But team captain Kalusha Bwalya is confident his 
boys will pull off a win . "The boys are keyed up after the Burkina Faso 
match and are more determined than ever to make sure of a place in the 
last eight," Great Kalu said
   Zambia's breath taking 5-1 win over Burkina Faso on Saturday night 
meant that they are now heading group B on goal difference.
   The scoreline was too much for the Burkinabe that  coach, Idrissa 
Traore refused to attend the mandatory mixed post match press 
conference. But nearly everyone here in Bloemfontein is full of praise 
for the Zambian  team.
   Former Aston Villa and Wimbledon stirker John Fashanu had this to 
say:  " This is the best team performance so far. Kulusha led by 
example, it makes me feel at 33 I am not too old to play soccer."

Zambia
President's Actions Sow Seeds of Anarchy

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)
by Fred M'membe (Column)

   Lusaka - President Chiluba's position on the method of  adopting the 
constitution has nothing to do with respect for the sovereignty of 
Parliament but much with fear of losing power if clauses that level the 
play field and broaden political competition are put in the 
constitution.
   The President's fear of losing the benefits of power, and not of  the 
opportunity to help create a better  Zambia for all, was made very clear 
at last month's MMD's extraordinary convention.
   The President reminded his government officials of the deprivations 
they will have to endure if he and the MMD were voted out. He reminded 
them of the houses, the cars and offices they will lose. But he failed 
to acknow-ladge that he will be the greatest loser as he is the highest 
beneficiary.
   This is what worries President Chiluba. This is what seems to propel 
him in all that he does. But the disastrous endings of people who pursue 
the goals of vanity in the world are many. And President Chiluba is 
pushing this country on that path. I beg all men and women of goodwill 
to go down on their knees to beg President Chiluba not to drag our 
country into chaos. A constitution that is not accepted and respected by 
a large section of society is a recipe for bloodshed. The President and 
his people, as defence minister Ben Mwila once remarked, have 
accumulated enough money to go and live abroad comfortably.
   The government seems to be running out of arguments to justify its 
refusal to adopt the Constitution through a constituent assembly.
   Opening the fifth session of the seventh National Assembly, President 
Frederick Chiluba warned that the government will not bow to pressure 
from some elements with axes to grind to adopt the constitution through 
a constituent assembly.
   The President also cautioned that any other procedures dictated to by 
disgruntled elements would only entail the law of the jungle. This type 
of language is very familiar to most Zambians. It is not different to 
former president Kenneth Kaunda's language during the Second Republic.
   But I fail to appreciate the link between one being disgruntled with 
President Chiluba and the method of adopting the constitution. What is 
personal about the Constitution? Can any reasonable person really 
personalise a Constitution? Is the Constitution of the Republic of 
Zambia a personal property of the President and his friends in the MMD 
club, which they can resolve to disband tomorrow?
   Can a citizen's rights be measured on the basis of his or her 
disposition towards those in power? The plural society Zambians ushered 
in 1991 had at its core, the empowerment of those with axes to grind 
them and the disgruntled to be disgruntled. Dissent is a constitutional 
right that must be scrupulously respected. President Chiluba was at one 
time a 'disgruntled' person with 'an axe to grind' with former president 
Kaunda. 
   Our Constitution will, and should, not be an exclusive product of the 
friends and supporters of a president. It should be a product of all 
Zambians - whether friends and foes of President Chiluba. This is the 
depth to which the President has sunk the constitutional debate! And 
this being the case it is understandable why the 'disgruntled' and the 
'axe grinders' are not comfortable with President Chiluba's method of 
adopting the Constitution.
   The more President Chiluba opens his mouth over the Constitution the 
more I am convinced he is not being honest and forthright with the 
Zambian people. The President's argument that a constituent assembly 
takes away the powers of Parliament is not very convincing when the 
Constitution of the Republic of Zambia provides for a referendum 
whenever there are any amendments to the Bill of Rights.
   The Constitutional Review Commission had proposed an extension of the 
Bill of Rights, in line with the MMD manifesto of 1991, which would have 
required subjecting the Constitution to a referendum. But President 
Chiluba, it appears, is not prepared to have anyone outside his control 
have any significant influence on the constitution, and he consequently 
got rid of all the proposed amendments to the Bill of Rights, in order 
to stay clear of a referendum, even if this meant breaking a written 
election promise.
   The 1991 MMD manifesto, on which President Chiluba claims he was 
elected, on page 3 promised: "The MMD is committed to extending the Bill 
of Rights to embrace categories such as the rights of the press and 
children and rights against all forms of discriminations against women.  
The MMD will uphold the Bill of Right with all its power."
   But this is not the only promise that has been expediently abandoned. 
The MMD promised not to subordinate the rights of the minority to that 
of the majority. But today, over the constitution, the MMD wants to use 
its parliamentary majority to subject all Zambians, even those who are 
not members of the MMD, to a party constitution.  
   The MMD manifesto on page 11 promised:  "The MMD upholds the 
democratic principles such as ... non-subordinations of the minority to 
the majority and the right of the minority to defend its interests 
publicly if their interests are threatened." The Munyama Human Rights 
Commission, in its report, politely noted the party's departure from 
this position. But what is much more worrying with the commission's 
observations is that the MMD has negated on the extension of the Bill of 
Rights when there are concerns that the courts are not doing much to 
advance liberties.
   "The judiciary was accused of being too timid and passing judgments 
that favoured the government, and were against the civil liberties of 
individuals," reads the Munyama Human Rights Commission report, adding: 
"It was then argued that fighting human rights  cases in court was an 
exercise in futility."
   And even Nelson Mandela, a law-abiding attorney whose desire for the 
freedom of his people to live in dignity drove him to become a criminal, 
turned this family-loving husband into a man without a home, forced this 
life-loving man  to live like a monk for more than a quarter of a 
century in jail, when his 'hour' won, he did not want to single-handedly 
write a constitution of South Africa.
   In his book, "Long Walk to Freedom", on page 743 Mandela writes: "We 
polled 62.6 per cent of national vote, slightly short of the two-thirds 
needed had we wished to push through a final constitution without 
support from other parties. Some in the ANC were disappointed that we 
did not cross the two-thirds threshold, but I was not one of them. In 
fact I was relieved; had we won two-thirds of the vote and been able to 
write a constitution unfettered by input from others, people would argue 
that we had created an ANC constitution, not a South African 
constitution. I wanted a true government of national unity."

YWCA Funds Small Scale Entrepreneurs

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 22, 1996 (19960122)

   Lusaka - About 400 small scale entrepreneurs would benefit from the 
US$240,000 budget for training set aside by the  Small Scale Business 
Development Centre at the Young Womens' Christian Association (YWCA) in 
Lusaka. Project Chief technical Advisor, Wendy Fitzgerald, said in an 
interview yesterday the programme will start on February 5, and run for 
a year.
   "We have budgeted $240, 000 for 1996 programmes and we hope to run 
about 8 short courses in various areas in small scale businesses," said 
Fiztgerald. Last year the centre trained about 300 small scale 
entrepreneurs, and some of the participants who attended the courses say 
it was beneficial to train at the centre.
   "I attended a three week course in small business development and I 
have improved very much in my operations and I think I am doing fine. I 
learnt a lot," said Evelyn Mwale of Lusaka's Longacres in an interview 
on Thursday.  The centre was established in 1993  by YWCA with Irish 
Aid.

'Apathy' Worries SA Soccer Boss

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - South Africa's soccer boss, Solomon "Stix" Morewa has 
expressed worry at the poor crowds attending the on-going Africa Cup of 
Nations games.
   Briefing pressmen and women on Tuesday, Morewa said the situation was
getting out of hand and would meet Confederation of Africa Football 
(CAF) officials this week with the aim of reviewing gate charges.
   Unreserved seats have been priced at R25 while reserved seats are 
going for R30.
   Poor crowds were seen during the Zambia versus Algeria and Sierra 
Leone versus Burkina Faso matches here in Bloemfontein and also during a 
night game on Monday at the giant FNB stadium where fewer than 2,000 
people watched the match.
   "The poor attendence is worrying us. We are to hold meetings with CAF 
to review the situation," said Morewa.
   Meanwhile, chairman of the organising committee here in Bloemfontein, 
Veli Mahlangu, has appealed to influntial local leaders to draw the 
attention of the community to the Africa Cup of Nations games being 
played at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.+++His appeal comes in 
the wake of the poor crowds that attended the two matches so far played 
in Bloemfontein.
   "This is very sad," said Mahlangu during a cocktail party hosted by 
Bloemfontein mayor, Jani Mohapi, in honour of the four competing teams 
and CAF officials.
   "We accept that African teams are mainly a foreign entity to our 
fans," Mahlangu said. "But we had hoped local fans would appreciate the 
chance if seeing the teams in action and therefore support their games."
   But some Bloemfontein residents interviewed say they are boycotting 
the games because of the exclusion of Bloemfontein-born local starand 
1995 national soccer league Player of the Year, David "Lesilo" Modise to 
the South African national team.

Soccer: Now Team Gets Serious

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 19, 1996 (19960119)
by Goodson Machona

   Bloemfontein - A serious mood engulfed the Zambian squad as they 
prepared for tomorrow's clash against Burkina Faso.
   The situation was further compounded after Algeria took over the 
leadership of Group B when they beat Sierra Leone 2-0 last night.
   Coach Roald Poulsen last night drilled his army in a gruelling two 
hours training session under floodlights.
   Poulsen's emphasis was to make sure his players got used to playing 
under the floodlights. Zambia's two remaining preliminaries have been 
slated at 20.00 hours.
   But Poulsen said he was not worried about Zambia playing their two 
remaining preliminary matches under flood lights.
   "There is definitely no problem," Poulsen on Wednesday night adding 
"There is no difference playing under flood lights or during the day."
   According to Poulsen, playing at night was a blessing in disguise 
because the temperatures here were stifling.
   "You cannot expect the players to play soccer in temperatures in the 
region of 32 degrees centigrade. Naturally the heat will inhibit and 
stifle their type of play," Poulsen said.
   But he admitted that it would have been better had the games been 
played during the day.
   "In Zambia, we play soccer during the day. But the boys are adapting 
well and looking forward to the games," Poulsen said.
   Camp manager Solly Pandor agreed. "I wouldn't say playing under flood 
lights is an advantage or disadvantage. But the morale in the camp is 
very high. There are no injuries and the boys are raring to go," Pandor 
said.
   So determined and sharp were the players in their workout that one 
Burkinabe journalist remarked; "Our boys are in trouble."
   Today is a rest day for the team. "We are taking them on a sight-
seeing tour of Bloemfontein but training will continue tomorrow, with 
two sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening," Pandor said.
   And Algeria yesterday beat a determined Sierra Leone side and 
immediately took over the leadership of Group B with four points from 
two games.
   A goal in each half were enough to push Sierra Leone into second 
position ahead of Zambia and Burkina Faso.
   Zambia plays Burkina Faso on Saturday while Algeria will have to wait 
for their last game against Burkina Faso.

Zambia
Three Quarters of Budget Donor Funded

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 18, 1996 (19960118)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - Seventy five per cent of Zambia's annual budget and 
development projects was donor funded in 1995, Finance Minister Ronald 
Penza disclosed in an interview yesterday in Chisamba.
   Penza said only 25 per cent was contributed to the overall budget by 
the taxpayer.
   "It's my intention to run Zambia at a profit but we have 70 per cent 
of theinvestment being foreign while 75 per cent of the so called budget 
is provided for by the donors, " Penza said. "It will take another 15 
years to get out of the current debts."
   And debt repayment obligations have also compounded Penza's 
headaches.
   "It's unfortunate that the $1.3 billion we got from the donors will 
only be used to repay debts," Penza carped. "We will have to repay at 0. 
05 per cent interest over a period of five and half years since now our 
credit worthiness is more enhanced."
   And this week opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) challenged 
in an open letter to the President for the government to explain where 
it was taking the money from tax collections since almost everything in 
the country is donor funded.
   But Penza dismissed LPF's charges saying understanding of economics 
seemed to be a problem in the party.
   "Twenty five per cent of Zambia's money went to the budget and 
Chongwe (LPFpresident) does not understand economics," Penza said. " He 
is just politicking."

Only 80,000 Register As Voters In Lusaka

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 18, 1996 (19960118)
by Reuben Phiri

   Lusaka - Less than 80,000, of a targeted 480,000 eligible citizens, 
have registered as voters in Lusaka so far, disclosed Lusaka Province 
registration officer, John Mulenga, in an interview yesterday.
   Mulenga, said the exercise which had picked up towards the close of 
the initial deadline is now slowing down again.
   He called on employers, NGO's, churches and other interested groups 
not to
 relax because of the extension but continue with publicity.
   "We need a lot of publicity if we have to meet our target of 483,496 
of eligible voters in Lusaka alone," Mulenga said. "We have only 
registered 79,965 as at January 10."
   But public liaison officer at Elections Office, Joel Sikazwe, said in 
an interview yesterday that the statistics reported in the press and 
attributed to his office were incorrect.
   "I am still compiling the data," Sikazwe said. "It will be 
communicated to the press when we are ready."
   And Elections Office will pay the field polling officers their 
allowances for the initial part of the exercise tomorrow.
   "Money has been released to pay the field officers for the first 
phase and we hope to pay the officers in Lusaka by Friday," Mulenga 
said.

Where Is Tax Money Going? Opposition Party Asks

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 17, 1996 (19960117)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - Opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) on Tuesday 
challenged President Frederick Chiluba in an open letter to explain 
where the taxpayer's money was going as most services government claimed 
to be providing were donor funded.
   The LPF letter claimed money from taxes was not being spent on things 
the majority of the people were crying for.
   "Government is not feeding the vulnerable groups," LPF claimed in its 
open letter to the President of Monday. "Donors are."
   LPF further charged that government was not supplying medicines in 
hospitals as the drug kits too came from donors.
   But neither State House nor the finance ministry or Ministry of 
Health wasprepared to respond to LPF's charges.
   "I think the issue is really a ministry of finance one so you should 
try MrPenza," said President Chiluba's public relations and press aide, 
Richard Sakala, in an interview yesterday. " I don't want to answer it 
in general terms."
   And health minister Michael Sata was also not in a position to defend 
hisministry, or the President, over the supply of medicines to 
hospitals.
   "If the letter was addressed to me I would have commented but since 
it wasaddressed to the President I cant comment," Sata said in an 
interview yesterday.
   And finance minister Ronald Penza and deputies could not be reached 
for comment as they were locked in a budget meeting.
   LPF accused government of not providing services that matched up to 
the value of taxes collected.
   "Government has not released money promised for maintenance from the 
Road Fund, despite fuel levies being increased in 1995," LPF's open 
letter to the President read, adding: "Government supplies of books and 
desks to schools have tickled to a halt. Government has not invested in 
water supply since the donors finished their drought relief programs."
   LPF advised President Chiluba to take advantage of his address at the 
opening of Parliament on Friday to restore hope to the people of Zambia.
   "We urge you to address how your government will reduce and re-target 
publicexpenditure in order to deliver the goods and services and what 
measures thegovernment will put in place to revive the economy and 
achieve growth in 1996," LPF urged.
   LPF claimed there was ample evidence of "flagrant extravagance in 
higher levels of government".
   "New cars, new offices, new furniture, and trips overseas," the 
letter stated. "Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) has confirmed that there 
is no shortage of money. In fact ZRA collected more money than budgeted 
for in 1995."

United States and Africa
[DOCUMENT] Southern Africa Media Group Criticizes U.S. Embassy

Africa News Service
January 15, 1996 (19960115)

   Statement by the Media Institute of South African (MISA), December 
15, 1995.
   United States embassy in Maputo confirmed that they have banned a 
U.S. journalist, Joseph Hanlon, from speaking to the ambassador and any 
of his staff regarding Mozambique. Ambassador Dennis Jett, told MISA on 
December 15 saying: "Hanlon is an unprofessional journalist whose 
reporting is totally and consistently biased. It is a waste of time 
talking to him."
   Hanlon is author of several books which focus on Mozambique. He also 
edited the "Peace Process Bulletin", put out by AWEPA (Association of 
European Parliamentarians for Southern Africa). In recent years, Hanlon 
covered, in detail, implementation of the 1992 peace accord between the 
government and the Renamo 'rebels'. And according to the Mozambique 
Information Agency (AIM), these credentials make Hanlon the best 
informed U.S. journalist on Mozambique.
   AIM reported on November 6,1995 that Hanlon requested, as he had done 
many times before, interviews with the U.S. embassy staff but press 
attach=E9 Adrienne O'Neal told him that nobody had any time to talk to 
him. "I informed her that the embassy has been talking to me for the 
past 15 years", Hanlon told AIM. On October 25, AIM reported, Hanlon 
spoke to O'Neal again but she replied: "I have talked to people here in 
the embassy and explained your concern and they say that nobody in the 
US embassy or at USAID will have time to talk to you". AIM reported that 
when Hanlon asked why this ban had been put on him, O'Neal is quoted as 
saying she did not have to give any reasons. But she is further quoted 
as having added: "There is a history to this."
   AIM reported that Hanlon had never had any problem in speaking to US 
officials during the pacification and election periods, even though what 
he wrote was frequently critical of US policy towards Mozambique. Hanlon 
said he did not understand the embassy's sudden change of the attitude. 
"Had the Mozambican government done this to me, the American embassy 
would have raised hell, and claimed that freedom of the press was under 
threat," Hanlon is quoted as saying. And added: "For a country that 
supposedly believes in freedom of information, the embassy's position is 
grotesque," and added, "it will be interesting to see whether the 
embassy's flagrant denial of freedom of information will figure in the 
next U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Mozambique."
   However, Ambassador Jett argued that although the embassy has banned 
Hanlon, the action does not affect freedom of press. "The government 
will not prevent journalists investigating their findings. But if the 
government doesn't want to talk to you, you can't force them to. It is 
my choice to take up questions," Ambassador Jett said. He further said 
that he talked to Hanlon extensively in the past, but he finds "his 
information in the books not good. Hanlon is hopelessly biased."

United States and Africa
[DOCUMENT] U.S. Ambassador Defends Refusal of Interviews to American 
Reporter

Africa News Service
January 15, 1996 (19960115)

   Maputo - Letter from the American Ambassador to Mozambique, Dennis 
Jett
to the publication MediaFax.
   Dear Editor of Mediafax:
   Permit me to respond to your editorial of December 19. In that 
editorial you called the American Embassy's refusal to give Joe Hanlon 
interviews with Embassy and USAID personnel a "flagrant violation of 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the right of person to 
be informed." Mr. Hanlon, AIM and Domingo have all made similar 
accusations. You also said that I, as ambassador, have no right to ban 
any embassy employee from speaking to a journalist.
   Clearly you do not understand the values behind the concepts you are 
so vigorously defending. I do not think this arises from different 
definitions of the terms involved, even though the American constitution 
and the Mozambican constitution are not identical on these points. The 
American constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of 
expression by declaring that the Congress shall make no law abridging 
the freedom of press, or of speech. It should therefore be obvious to 
anyone that an embassy cannot violate freedom of the press in the 
American sense of term, since only the parliament in a particular 
country can pass a law that would interfere with a journalist's ability 
to express or publish his opinions.
   The Mozambican constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom 
of speech as well, but uses somewhat different words to accomplish this. 
Article 74 of the constitution states:
   "1. All the citizens shall have the right to freedom of expression 
and to freedom of the press, as well as the right to information.
   2. Freedom of expression, which includes the right to disseminate 
one's opinion by all legal means, and the right to information, shall 
not be limited by censorship. 
   3. Freedom of press shall include in particular the freedom of 
journalistic expression and creativity, access to sources of 
information, protection of professional independence and 
confidentiality, and the right to publish newspapers and other 
publications." 
   Since the Embassy has done nothing to prevent Mr. Hanlon from 
expressing his thoughts or publishing them, clearly the only question 
that arises is whether the embassy has violated Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information or his right to access to sources of information.
   Mozambique's press law, law number 18/91, contains article 29 
entitled "Access to sources of information." It states "Access to 
OFFICIAL (emphasis added) sources of information shall be granted to 
journalists in the course of their work." Would the distinguished editor 
of MediaFax have his readers believe that Article 29, which only 
mentions "official" sources of information, is referring to the 
information of all governments in the world and not just that of the 
Mozambican government? 
   In any case, I and other members of this Embassy have frequently made 
ourselves available to the press in those cases where we believed it was 
productive to do so. At the same time, Mr.Hanlon's request for 
interviews was not the first we have declined because we thought it 
would not be useful.
   Since access to official sources of information obviously does not 
apply, that only leaves the question whether Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information could have been violated. Article 3 of law 18/91 entitled 
"right to information" states: "In the field of the press, the right to 
information means the ability of every citizen to inform himself and to 
be informed of facts and opinions of national and international 
consequence, as well as the right to release information, opinions and 
ideas through the press." The citizens of Mozambique therefore have the 
right to inform themselves and be infomed by journalists. Would the 
distinguished editor of Mediafax have his readers believe that this 
should be interpreted that any time anyone refuses to answer any 
question of any journalist, that the rights of all 16 million 
Mozambicans have just been violated?
   Has the distinguished editor of MediaFax never heard in his 
professional career the response "no comment"? Has he never had a phone 
call that was not returned or never had a question he posed that was not 
fully answered? If this has happened in the past, why have you not 
informed the people of Mozambique in each and every instance in which 
their rights have been violated? 
   I think the above argument demonstrates the total absurdity of the 
assertion that the Embassy's decision regarding Mr. Hanlon violated 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression or the right of the people 
to be informed. You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I 
did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a 
journalist.
   When it comes to expressing official government opinions during 
official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not 
only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official 
positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the 
obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money 
is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr. 
Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his 
reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of 
Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of 
objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.
   Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe 
that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of 
any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority, 
be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine 
whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case, 
Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to 
include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution 
is such a right described.
   I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the 
letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the 
spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one 
occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November 
regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity 
of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the 
press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who 
had worked at AIM and you pointed out "AIM journalists had to continue 
to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without 
success."
   While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed. 
When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but 
was always referred to as the "armed bandits." Today AIM only describes 
Renamo as "the former rebel movement." It never calls Renamo "the 
largest opposition political party" or even "an opposition party." 
Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the "ruling party" 
or the "governing party" which is an accurate description of the present 
without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded 
every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's 
intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for 
liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a 
"former rebel movement?"
   This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias, 
but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following 
quote regarding AIM may interest you: "the service, however, causes some 
controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a 
service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information 
service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law." The quote 
is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of "Savana," 
an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.
   Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about 
freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore 
the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an 
editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last 
word.
   While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an 
important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now 
enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently 
concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had 
been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them 
war broke out again.
   Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating 
the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether 
democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the 
institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a 
strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of 
those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by 
the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the 
oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this 
regard should be taken seriously.
   When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to 
negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent. 
The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other 
repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and 
unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The 
role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war 
and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.
   Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time 
complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time 
worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some 
of those who practice your profession.
   Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust 
you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its 
entirety.
   Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of 
and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, 
please accept assurances of my highest consideration.

be informed." Mr. Hanlon, AIM and Domingo have all made similar 
accusations. You also said that I, as ambassador, have no right to ban 
any embassy employee from speaking to a journalist.
   Clearly you do not understand the values behind the concepts you are 
so vigorously defending. I do not think this arises from different 
definitions of the terms involved, even though the American constitution 
and the Mozambican constitution are not identical on these points. The 
American constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom of 
expression by declaring that the Congress shall make no law abridging 
the freedom of press, or of speech. It should therefore be obvious to 
anyone that an embassy cannot violate freedom of the press in the 
American sense of term, since only the parliament in a particular 
country can pass a law that would interfere with a journalist's ability 
to express or publish his opinions.
   The Mozambican constitution protects freedom of the press and freedom 
of speech as well, but uses somewhat different words to accomplish this. 
Article 74 of the constitution states:
   "1. All the citizens shall have the right to freedom of expression 
and to freedom of the press, as well as the right to information.
   2. Freedom of expression, which includes the right to disseminate 
one's opinion by all legal means, and the right to information, shall 
not be limited by censorship. 
   3. Freedom of press shall include in particular the freedom of 
journalistic expression and creativity, access to sources of 
information, protection of professional independence and 
confidentiality, and the right to publish newspapers and other 
publications." 
   Since the Embassy has done nothing to prevent Mr. Hanlon from 
expressing his thoughts or publishing them, clearly the only question 
that arises is whether the embassy has violated Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information or his right to access to sources of information.
   Mozambique's press law, law number 18/91, contains article 29 
entitled "Access to sources of information." It states "Access to 
OFFICIAL (emphasis added) sources of information shall be granted to 
journalists in the course of their work." Would the distinguished editor 
of MediaFax have his readers believe that Article 29, which only 
mentions "official" sources of information, is referring to the 
information of all governments in the world and not just that of the 
Mozambican government? 
   In any case, I and other members of this Embassy have frequently made 
ourselves available to the press in those cases where we believed it was 
productive to do so. At the same time, Mr.Hanlon's request for 
interviews was not the first we have declined because we thought it 
would not be useful.
   Since access to official sources of information obviously does not 
apply, that only leaves the question whether Mr. Hanlon's right to 
information could have been violated. Article 3 of law 18/91 entitled 
"right to information" states: "In the field of the press, the right to 
information means the ability of every citizen to inform himself and to 
be informed of facts and opinions of national and international 
consequence, as well as the right to release information, opinions and 
ideas through the press." The citizens of Mozambique therefore have the 
right to inform themselves and be infomed by journalists. Would the 
distinguished editor of Mediafax have his readers believe that this 
should be interpreted that any time anyone refuses to answer any 
question of any journalist, that the rights of all 16 million 
Mozambicans have just been violated?
   Has the distinguished editor of MediaFax never heard in his 
professional career the response "no comment"? Has he never had a phone 
call that was not returned or never had a question he posed that was not 
fully answered? If this has happened in the past, why have you not 
informed the people of Mozambique in each and every instance in which 
their rights have been violated? 
   I think the above argument demonstrates the total absurdity of the 
assertion that the Embassy's decision regarding Mr. Hanlon violated 
freedom of the press, freedom of expression or the right of the people 
to be informed. You also made the point, however, that as ambassador, I 
did not have the right to ban anyone in the embassy from speaking to a 
journalist.
   When it comes to expressing official government opinions during 
official working hours -- which is what Mr. Hanlon requested -- I not 
only have the right, but the obligation to ensure that official 
positions are expressed coherently and consistently. I also have the 
obligation to the taxpayers of the United States to see that their money 
is not wasted. We have spent many hours in the past answering Mr. 
Hanlon's questions, which failed to improve the quality of his 
reporting. Using more time of embassy personnel to respond to more of 
Mr. Hanlon's questions, given his ideological orientation and lack of 
objectivity, would therefore be a waste of such resources.
   Would the distinguished editor of MediaFax have his readers believe 
that any journalist has the right to ask any question of any employee of 
any organization at any time and that no one in a position of authority, 
be it a manager, minister or ambassador, has the right to determine 
whether or how the question will be answered? If that is the case, 
Article 27 of law 18/91, which lists the rights of journalists, fails to 
include such a right and nowhere else in that law or in the constitution 
is such a right described.
   I believe this is more than just a case of not understanding the 
letter of the law; it is also a fundamental lack of comprehension of the 
spirit of the law. This lack of understanding is not limited to this one 
occasion. When the Embassy's press attache wrote you in November 
regarding Mr. Hanlon, you took offense at her suggestion that an entity 
of the government like AIM perhaps doesn't understand freedom of the 
press. You termed this an insult to you and the other journalists who 
had worked at AIM and you pointed out "AIM journalists had to continue 
to struggle a great deal for this press freedom, sometimes without 
success."
   While you may have struggled, I would agree that you did not succeed. 
When you were director of AIM, Renamo was never mentioned by name, but 
was always referred to as the "armed bandits." Today AIM only describes 
Renamo as "the former rebel movement." It never calls Renamo "the 
largest opposition political party" or even "an opposition party." 
Frelimo, on the other hand, is always referred to as the "ruling party" 
or the "governing party" which is an accurate description of the present 
without reference to the past. Do AIM's readers need to be reminded 
every day that Renamo was once a rebel movement? If it is AIM's 
intention to teach history, in view of its successful struggle for 
liberation from colonialism, why isn't Frelimo ever referred to as a 
"former rebel movement?"
   This problem with nomenclature is perhaps a small example of bias, 
but I am not the only one who doubts AIM's impartiality. The following 
quote regarding AIM may interest you: "the service, however, causes some 
controversy, as many professionals are of the opinion that it is a 
service of governmental propaganda instead of being an information 
service with independence and objectivity guaranteed by law." The quote 
is from an article on page 5 of the August 28, 1995 issue of "Savana," 
an excellent newspaper that I recommend you read.
   Some would argue that it is pointless to enter into a debate about 
freedom of press with those who do not understand it or choose to ignore 
the values that are its foundation. Others say that arguing with an 
editor is a no-win situation since he (or she) will always have the last 
word.
   While I do not disagree with these arguments, I think it is an 
important debate nonetheless because the peace which Mozambique now 
enjoys is by no means assured. One academic study which I read recently 
concluded that during the last fifty years in countries where there had 
been civil wars that were ended through negotiation, in one half of them 
war broke out again.
   Whether Mozambique is part of the half that succeeds in not repeating 
the tragedy of the past will depend, to a large degree, on whether 
democracy succeeds here. Democracy can function successfully only if the 
institutions that are its foundations can function. In addition to a 
strong legislature and an independent judiciary, a free press is one of 
those essential institutions. Can the press be free if it is owned by 
the government? Is AIM your argument that it can? As the editor of the 
oldest independent publication in Mozambique, your opinions in this 
regard should be taken seriously.
   When reading the accounts of those who worked for two years to 
negotiate the General Peace Agreement in Rome, one theme is consistent. 
The mutual lack of confidence that the two parties had in each other 
repeatedly complicated the process. The climate created by a biased and 
unobjective press clearly contributed to this mutual lack of trust. The 
role played by the press therefore probably served to prolong the war 
and certainly served to make implementation of the peace more difficult.
   Distinguished editor of Mediafax, perhaps you should spend less time 
complaining about your friend being denied an interview and more time 
worrying about the threat to continued peace in Mozambique posed by some 
of those who practice your profession.
   Since article 33 of law 18/91 describes the right to reply, I trust 
you will not violate my rights and will publish this letter in its 
entirety.
   Along with the hope that the New Year brings greater understanding of 
and appreciation for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, 
please accept assurances of my highest consideration.

United States and Africa
Congressional Resolution on Kenya

Washington Office on Africa
January 13, 1996 (19960113)

   Washington, D.C. - Rep. John Porter is submitting the following 
concurrent resolution this week; which will be referred to the House of 
Representatives Committee on International Relations, Africa 
Subcommittee.
   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION: Expressing the sense of the House of 
Representatives concerning the political and human rights situation in 
the Republic of Kenya.
   Whereas the Governments of the United States and the Republic of 
Kenya have enjoyed friendly relations as the Republic of Kenya has been 
an important and politically stable ally to the United States in Africa;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is a major tourist destination in East 
Africa enhancing its economic and political importance to the United 
States;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya is one of the largest recipients of 
United States foreign assistance in sub-Saharan Africa;
   Whereas such foreign assistance had been offered to encourage 
democratic freedoms, human rights, and political stability in the 
Republic of Kenya;
   Whereas after nine years as a single-party state led by the Kenya 
Africa National Union, a 1991 constitutional amendment restored multi-
party democracy;
   Whereas the Kenyan Constitution guarantees the rights of assembly, 
association, conscience, and expression;
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya, as a signatory to the United Nations 
Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
the African Charter, is obliged to adhere to its international legal 
obligations and to protect the fundamental human rights of all its 
citizens;
   Whereas despite the 1991 Constitutional amendment restoring multi-
party democracy, the Government of Kenya continues to wage a campaign of 
repression designed to eliminate criticism and dissent;
   Whereas Government of Kenya security forces have harassed and 
detained government critics, including former cabinet members and other 
advocating multi-party democracy;
   Whereas former member of Parliament from Nakuru, Koigi wa Wamwere, 
who has been recognized as a determined opponent to ethnic cleansing, 
brutality, and corruption in the Republic of Kenya, has been targeted by 
the Government of Kenya for his political beliefs and has spent the 
batter part of the last nine years in police detention;
   Whereas numerous international human rights groups and independent 
international observers have concluded that the trial and sentencing of 
Mr. Wamwere and his two co-defendants, Charles Kuria Wamwere and G.G. 
Njuguna Ngengi, to four years in prison and six "strokes" (lashes with a 
cane), was conducted in a manner that was inconsistent with 
international legal standards, that the charges against the defendants 
were unsubstantiated by the evidence, that much of the evidence was 
fabricated, and that the trial was not conducted by an independent and 
impartial tribunal;
   Whereas the Government of Kenya continues to intimidate and harass 
human rights attorneys, peaceful demonstrators, and human rights 
activists by regularly interfering with many civil liberties, including 
freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya, especially political 
prisoners, are detained in prison for indefinite periods of time without 
being charged with a crime;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya charged with crimes remain 
in prison for excessively lengthy periods of time without being brought 
to trial;
   Whereas prisoners in the Republic of Kenya are often subjected to 
various kinds of torture, including beating with sticks, fists, handles 
of hoes, and gun butts, often resulting in permanent disability;
   Whereas life threatening prison conditions in the Republic of Kenya, 
including sexual abuse, severe over crowding, poor diet, inadequate 
health care, substandard bedding materials, and flooded or unheated 
cells led to several hundred deaths in prison in 1994;
   Whereas despite constitutional provisions to the contrary and the 
Kenya Police Commissioner's June 1993 announcement that torture was 
prohibited and would not be tolerated, there continue to be credible 
reports that police and security forces resort to torture and brutality 
to break up licensed public assemblies;
   Whereas the President of Kenya exerts overwhelming influence over the 
country's judiciary, including through the President's refusal to renew 
contracts of the three High Court Judges who have issued rulings adverse 
to the government; and
   Whereas the Republic of Kenya's political stability is threatened by 
the Government of Kenya's repression of individual rights and democratic 
freedoms and its intolerance toward political dissent:
   Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring),
   SECTION 1: STATEMENT OF POLICY:
   It is the sense of the Congress that the Government of Kenya should:
   1. Uphold the rights of assembly, association, conscience, and 
expression, which are guaranteed in the Kenyan Constitution;
   2. Adhere to its international legal obligations under the United 
Nations Charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, and the African Charter;
   3. End all intimidation and harassment of those who are critical of 
government policies and those working for democracy in Kenya, 
particularly individuals within the church, the press, and the legal and 
academic communities;
   4. Either charge and try or release all prisoners, including persons 
detained for political reasons;
   5. Cease all physical abuse or mistreatment of prisoners;
   6. Release Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere and permit him to exercise his rights 
of free expression, association, and political participation in a multi-
party democracy; and
   7. Restore the independence of the judiciary.
   SECTION 2. ASSISTANCE TO REPUBLIC OF KENYA: It is the sense of the 
Congress that the United States should consider reducing, and possibly 
suspending, military and economic assistance to the Republic of Kenya 
unless the Government of Kenya makes substantial progress in addressing 
the concerns set forth in Section 1.

Africa-at-Large
World Football Stars on South African Stage

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lungile Madywabe 
   Johannesburg - Some of the world's greatest players will from this 
weekend grace South African soccer pitches. This is despite the debacle 
surrounding the withdrawal of champions Nigeria.
   Nigeria have the largest contingent of players plying their trade in 
Europe, but the 15 nations taking part in the tournament are packed with 
players who are playing for top overseas clubs. 
   As the world's leading clubs broaden their search for talent, Africa 
has become a good hunting ground for them, and stars from many poor 
African countries are now earning fortunes with the rich European clubs. 
   The most well known of these is George Weah, who is having a great 
season with Italy's AC Milan. Since re-admission, South Africa has also 
exported many local stars with John "Shoes" Moshoeu, playing in Turkey, 
being the most expensive player.
   GEORGE WEAH (Liberia)
   GEORGE APPONG WEAH is simply the best player on earth at the moment. 
World soccer's governing body, Fifa, confirmed that on Monday when Weah 
was voted World Player of the Year.
   He has played much of his football outside his war-torn country, 
starring for a French club before moving to the Italian Serie A giants 
AC Milan. But Weah's love for Liberia has led him to contribute some of 
his earning towards the national team and he has inspired them to their 
first appearance in the African nations Cup.
   National coach Wilfred Lardner knows that in Weah he has someone 
around whom he can build a strong team capable of upsetting the 
tournament's favourites. Liberian minister of sport Francois Massaquoi 
said: "He has shown the world that Liberians are not just killers, but 
also decent people with talent and mastery of certain crafts." 
   With Nigeria out of the finals and Weah leading their attack, Liberia 
have a good chance of advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament.
   ANTHONY YEBOAH (Ghana)
   ANTHONY YEBOAH has not lost the goal touch that prompted England's 
Leeds United to pay $3,4-million to Eintracht Frankfurt for his 
services. He was a prolific goalscorer in the German Bundesliga and 
Yeboah's continued appetite for what he is paid to do earned him the 
goal of the month award in September and October last year. 
   Asked about his much-publicised squabble with team captain Abedi 
"Pele" Ayew, he said: "Blown out of proportion". However, Ghana 's 
failure in Tunisia 94 was attributed to internal quarrels. Having failed 
in two previous tournaments, Yeboah knows that this may be his last 
chance. The 30-year-old striker has a lethal shot with both feet and if 
his 25-yard scorchers do not elude him, he may be the top goal scorer of 
the tournament.
   DOCTOR KHUMALO (South Africa)
   WAY back in 1992 in Zimbabwe, when South Africa were beaten 4-1 in a 
African Nations Cup qualifier, the most talked about player then was 
Doctor Khumalo (right), with the Zimbabweans dubbing him a "nurse". He 
has come a long way since then, and has put in some assured and skillful 
performances for the national team. 
   The Kaizer Chiefs idol always plays in patches but with a strong 
contingent around him he can rise to the occasion.
   He spent the latter part of last year rueing a botched deal with a 
club in Argentina but  next season he is likely to play in the revamped 
American league. Khumalo will be looking to make a big impression at 
this tournament so that he can clinch himself a better deal in a more 
competitive league than the United States. 
   KALUSHA BWALYA (Zambia)
   TEAM captain Kalusha Bwalya will best be remembered for leading 
Zambia to the finals of the 1994 tournament in Tunisia against Nigeria 
after he was one of the survivors of the 1993 plane crash in Gabon which 
killed all but three members of the national squad. "Great Lusha" is 
still with us today because he simply missed the flight.
   Those who saw the 1994 finals will remember how close Bwalya came to 
equalising in the final against Nigeria, hitting the crossbar with a 40m 
drive.
   The 33-year-old Bwaly is currently playing for Club America in Mexico 
and with Johnson Bwalya and Kenneth Malitoli alongside him, this left- 
footed midfielder could give goalkeepers a hard time. Having come that 
close in Tunisia with a makeshift squad, this time around they may hit 
the jackpot.

South Africa
Task Force Looks at Government Info and Media Ownership

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The task team appointed by Deputy President Thabo 
Mbeki to look at the media will be reviewing the South African 
Communications Services (SACS) -- government's current communications 
model -- in a bid to find new and more effective means of disseminating 
government information to the public.
   A brief for Friday's meeting sent by Mbeki's office to all ten 
members of the task team urges participants to concentrate on 
investigating, among others issues, the relationship between SACS and 
those print and electronic media structures not linked to government.
   Freedom of Expression Institute chairman Raymond Louw, who is a task 
team member, said the team would also be reviewing the government's 
existing policy on communication and placing "special emphasis" on re-
assessing affirmative action policies.
   "Ownership and control of the media, and how it affects government 
communications is also one of the key issues for the task team," Louw 
said.
   Another member of the task team, the Sowetan's political editor, 
Mathatha Tsedu, said foreign control of the media by large conglomerates 
and monopolies should be a priority for the task team because foreign 
ownership impeded the process of ensuring a "diversity of voices" among 
the press.
   "I believe that the large groups controlling the media should 
unbundle and relinquish shares. Sowetan staffers have appealed to the 
Independent Group to sell its stake in the Sowetan and allow them to buy 
shares. This displays the urgency with which our team has to discuss 
foreign control of the media," Tsedu said.
   More than 80 percent of South African print media is controlled by 
four major players: namely, Times Media Limited, Independent Newspapers 
Holdings, Perskor and the Nasionale Pers.
   Although members agreed on the issue of spurring affirmative action, 
some feared that government may resort to "undesirable means" of 
implementation such as using government advertising money to implement 
the policy.

Parliament Prepares Intelligence Probe

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Gaye Davis

   Johannesburg -   Parliament's watchdog over the intelligence 
community faces its most crucial test as it prepares to uncover the 
truth behind the police spying scandal.
   The Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence thrashed out its terms 
of reference for its investigation into police claims that top members 
were being spied on by agents of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), 
which has denied the allegations, during a five-hour meeting behind 
closed doors this week.
   "We have already had our battles with the intelligence services. How 
we deal with this case is a test for us as far as the public is 
concerned," committee chair, African National Congress MP Lindiwe 
Sisulu-Guma, told the Mail & Guardian.
   The committee is responsible for monitoring the two national 
intelligence services -- the NIA, which deals with domestic threats, and 
the South African Secret Service, which deals with external threats -- 
as well as the intelligence arms of the police and defence force. Its 
power lies in its legislated right to approve or veto budgets: "We hold 
the purse-strings," said Sisulu-Guma.
   Public interviews of seven nominees shortlisted for the post of 
Inspector General of Intelligence -- a civilian who will deal with 
complaints of abuses from the public and within the services themselves 
-- start on February 20.
   The candidates have been drawn from a list of nominees submitted by 
all seven political parties and three nominated by members of the 
public.
   The final choice must be approved by a 75 percent majority in 
Parliament -- more than the two-thirds required to amend the 
constitution, because of the nature of the job.
   Since it started work four months ago, the committee has had to 
scrutinise intelligence budgets, learn about the services it is supposed 
to monitor, and find a balance between transparency and secrecy. 
   "It's the most difficult balancing act imaginable. We must do it 
properly or the concept of transparency will be destroyed." It will 
report to Parliament on its work during February. "Nothing will be 
excluded without our first consulting all the political parties and 
nothing will be included that jeopardises the national interest."
   The committee meets on February 7 to consider reports on the spying 
scandal it has called for from the police and the NIA, and to decide 
whom to subpoena to give evidence. It will investigate the truth of 
allegations of the use of bugs and other surveillance of senior police 
officers and prepare a report, with recommendations, for parliament and 
the executive.

Man Who Exposed Police Misdeeds Regrets Six-Year-Old Confession

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Peta Thornycroft
   Johannesburg - It's been a long time coming, but Dirk Coetzee has had 
enough. He now regrets having spoken out in 1989 about killer squads in 
the South African Police.
   His confession six years ago about his own role in sanctioned murders 
and his breathtaking exposure of the rot deep in the South African 
security police has brought him little but grief. When he first told 
Vrye Weekblad reporter Jacques Pauw his story, both he and his claims 
were ridiculed in much of the then mainstream media. He had to spend 
four years in uncomfortable exile, in constant fear of being 
assassinated.
   And the propaganda machine within the South African Police, and the 
remnants of that machine which is still functioning, has pursued him 
relentlessly. This week was the final straw.
   His old colleague, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz (who 
probably owes Coetzee at least a good lunch for alerting the African 
National Congress that he was "untainted" and therefore probably the 
best compromise to be the future National Commissioner), chose to ignore 
him and go public with another man's accusations against him
   Fivaz decided to endorse a version of events given to him by another 
former security policeman Inspector HT Moodley: Moodley claims Dirk 
Coetzee told him he was under orders to bug senior policemen at a 
meeting at National Intelligence Agency headquarters six weeks ago.
   Coetzee scoffs at this. His version is that Moodley, "a pleasant 
fellow," visited him at NIA HQ and asked him to make a statement about 
the assassination of ANC lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in Durban in 1981. 
Mxenge's brother had decided to ask the police to charge Coetzee after 
participating in a Yorkshire Television documentary in which Coetzee 
once again repeated his confession, that under orders from his superiors 
in the security police, he sent his men to kill Mxenge.
   Coetzee says he told Moodley at the "relaxed" meeting he would not 
make a statement to the police, but he would be telling the Mxenge 
story, for the last time, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
   Coetzee, uncomfortable in his NIA job as a "spook", says he has 
neither access to "bugging" devices, nor has he ever been involved in 
bugging operations in his life, and that he is in the wrong department 
at the NIA to do any bugging, even if he knew how. He also claims that 
nobody in the NIA asked him to do any bugging, ever.
   According to Coetzee neither Fivaz nor anyone else, including his 
bosses at NIA, asked him his version of the bugging allegations 
contained in a report by Independent Newspapers' investigative unit, 
Spectrum.
   Coetzee learned of Fivaz's statement early last Thursday morning when 
a friend phoned him to tell him the newspaper reports were being aired 
on radio news bulletins.
   Coetzee is bewildered about why he was the last to find out, and 
said: "Let me and Moodley have a lie detector test." Moodley refused to 
talk to the M&G, and referred us to Fivaz.
   Coetzee is not supposed to talk to the press. He would far prefer to 
be back in the police, which he left on "medical grounds" after a 
disciplinary hearing in 1986.
   He's an unconventional, outspoken wild card for the new government. 
In an interview with Tribute magazine before the elections he accused 
the ANC intelligence community of incompetence, and that didn't do his 
career much good. And he's not sure, after this week and his outrage in 
the press, what his job prospects are like with the NIA.
   And he's deeply hurt that some men who covered up and lied about the 
hit squads are generals in the police, while he is ill-placed in the 
state spy shop. Coetzee is not an angel, but so far he has never been 
caught in a lie.
   Fivaz told the M&G late on Thursday he had at no stage commented on 
the veracity of the allegations against Coetzee. He said he had 
discussed the bugging with intelligence boss Mo Shaik, who had decided 
to let the matter rest.

Police Accused Over Christmas Day Massacre

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Eddie Koch and Mehlo Mvelase

   Johannesburg - Police either colluded in the Christmas Day massacre 
at Shobashobane or are guilty of negligence in the run-up to the attack 
that left 19 people dead in the KwaZulu-Natal village, according to a 
television documentary to be broadcast by SABC's Agenda programme on 
Sunday night.
   The documentary includes strong criticisms from Captain Shaun 
Vollenhoven, former commander of the police station near Shobashobane, 
of the co-ordination of the security operation in the area before the 
attack.
   Vollenhoven, who has been transferred from the police station at his 
own request, feels that his efforts to introduce new and more community-
friendly policing methods in the area had been consistently undermined.
   "The old police structure which we are trying to change now is still 
not ready for change," says Vollenoven in response to queries from the 
film crew about lack of co-ordination in the way police behaved before 
and during the massacre.
   The documentary, made by Mail & Guardian Television with the SABC, 
includes an in-depth examination of how the massacre took place and 
explores the possibilities for restoring order to the region.
   One of Vollenhoven's key criticisms relates to the lack of 
communication between the police station and various other security 
operatives in the area. He was, he said, unable to provide an 
explanation for the fact that an Internal Stability Unit patrol, which 
was supposed to have been on duty in the area, was not present at the 
time of the attack in Shobashobane. He was also not informed about 
houses being searched and weapons allegedly being confiscated in 
Shobashobane on the day before the attack.
   "I was not aware of the search by outside units," says Vollenhoven. 
"This creates a perception that police are siding with one party."
   The documentary points out that these anomalies occurred even though 
African National Congress leaders and independent monitors had informed 
senior police officers that an attack on Shobashobane could be expected 
in the Christmas period.
   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has asked Neville Melville, police 
reporting officer for KwaZulu-Natal and former advocate, to head up a 
special task force that will probe allegations of police complicity or 
negligence regarding the massacre. Members of the Investigative Task 
Unit, a crack team of detectives that reports directly to Mufamadi, will 
help with this probe.
   Police Commissioner George Fivaz has also sent a top team of 34 
detectives to Port Shepstone to investigate the massacre, headed by 
Pretoria detective Bushie Engelbrecht. Fivaz announced in a press 
statement that extra informers would be sent into the area and that the 
use of extra powers, granted to the provincial commissioner under the 
Police Act, was also possible.
   Engelbrecht's men began interviewing eyewitnesses and survivors of 
the massacre on Tuesday this week. The team has issued warrants of 
arrest for four suspects believed to have been involved in the attack. 
   In addition, a National Public Order Policing (Pop) Unit will be set 
up in Natal under command of former ISU commander Vernon Hunter. The Pop 
teams will set up temporary bases in various hotspots of the province 
and will concentrate on the South Coast.
   These moves represent an effort by the national police commissioner 
-- along with Mufamadi's office -- to stamp their authority on the 
province. The Inkatha Freedom Party has insisted policing is primarily a 
provincial matter and has already signaled its intention to oppose 
"unilateral" intervention by national authorities. 
   "We are worried by Fivaz's comment that more spies will be sent into 
the province as we have been victims of unlawful espionage on our 
officials by members of the intelligence agencies," said IFP secretary 
general Ziba Jiyane.
   The Inkatha leader says the new measures on the South Coast could 
amount to anti-Inkatha intervention by central government in the 
province. "We are not saying the central government should not be 
involved in security matters in KwaZulu-Natal. But Schedule Six of the 
Constitution says policing is also a provincial issue and as long at it 
[national intervention] is done in a unilateral way this is invariably a 
partisan approach."
   The action by the national police authorities and Jiyane's response 
indicates that the Shobashabane killings may have initiated a major 
conflict between the central and provincial governments over who will 
control the way KwaZulu-Natal is policed.

South Africa
Mandela's Children Fund Corners Donations

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Marion Edmunds

   Johannesburg -  President Nelson Mandela's high-profile Children's 
Fund has netted more than R12- million since its inception last year, 
with a further R24-million pledged to it. while humbler non-government 
organisations (NGOs) are battling for money.  
   As a result, NGOs are frightened that Mandela's Midas touch is 
proving so successful that it is threatening their own ability to raise 
funds to care for South Africa's poor and homeless children. 
   These NGOs, many of which have lost foreign funders in post-apartheid 
South Africa, are desperate for larger donations from big business to 
help disadvantaged children, and are eyeing the millions in Mandela's 
fund with envy and reservations. 
   Mandela's Children's Fund has received R12- million, with a further 
R24-million pledged to it over the next five years. There are now 28 
members in the President's Club --individuals, businesses and foreign 
governments that have matched Mandela's donation to the fund and whose 
members are giving R150 000 or more over five years. The club includes 
US actor Denzil Washington, the Norwegian government, Barlows, Coca-
Cola, Pierre Cardin and M-Net.
   The marketing director of the South African National Council for 
Child and Family Welfare, Hennie Oosthuizen, said this week: "I believe 
that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund has the potential to take donors 
away from child welfare organisations because it can offer exposure to 
donors, and all we can offer is accountability. We need some of that 
money in our organisation and we could use it successfully."
   The chief executive trustee of the Fund, Jeremy Ractliffe, responded 
by saying, "I do not know of any of our donors who have given to the 
Mandela's Children Fund through not funding some other NGO in the field 
we concentrate on ... I would welcome discussions with NGOs who feel 
that they have lost out to the Fund."
   It cannot be disputed that Mandela's name sanctifies his Children's 
Fund, giving it a political and emotional appeal of international 
standing. (Those who become part of the President's Club receive a 
certificate signed by Mandela, as well as a photograph of the donor with 
Mandela.)
   Smaller, humbler NGOs -- which have worked for decades in South 
Africa's forgotten communities -- are throwing up their hands in 
despair, saying that they just cannot compete with the Mandela name. 
This is ironic, given the fact that these NGOs were the unofficial 
conduit for foreign funds during apartheid years, funds which, in many 
instances, helped prepare South Africa and the African National Congress 
for the transition to democracy.
   Chairperson of the Save the Children Fund, Mary Hanna, said this week 
that it was becoming increasingly difficult to raise money and that 
high-profile funds were attracting donations which had previously gone 
to Save the Children. 
   "The demands are increasing and the funds are not ... we have had to 
severely curtail our nutrition programmes in places like the Northern 
Province, for example, and as far as we know there is no other 
organisation working there to take our place." 
   Johannesburg Child Welfare has retrenched 22 social workers this year 
to cope with the drop in funding, according to Anne Bown, manager of 
funding and public relations. 
   Bown said people were much less generous than they used to be and 
that they were struggling to find donors, especially needed as the state 
had cut its subsidy by R1-million, and foreign governments were giving 
to the Reconstruction and Development Programme. 
   The funding and development manager of the Child Welfare Society in 
Cape Town, Jetty Botes, said that the society's 1996 to 1997 budget was 
short by more than a million rand and that it would have to cut projects 
unless saved by a windfall.
   "Corporations provide 15 to 20 percent of our funding currently -- 
this is less than it used to be," she said.
   Ractliffe said this week that information and application forms were 
freely available and that he had distributed R3 500 brochures about the 
Fund.
   He said the Fund focused on organisations that were on the coal-face 
of development work and working directly with communities. The fund's 
brochure states that it assists organisations working with disadvantaged 
children, with a particular emphasis on children in detention, children 
who have had no formal education, who are handicapped, and homeless 
children. 
   Ractliffe said 92 grants had already been made, many to projects 
involving street children. Altogether R1,5-million had been disbursed 
and more than R5-million would be paid out in 1996, he said. The Fund 
intended to allocate not less than 75 percent of the interest from its 
capital base and 25 percent of its annual opening capital to projects 
every year, he said.
   The Mandela Children's Fund has, in conjunction with other NGOs, 
helped to fund a Youth Development Centre at Leeuwkop Prison in Gauteng, 
a similar centre at Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal, and has donated R38 000 
to the NGO Streetwise. The decisions about which NGOs and organisations 
to fund would be made at quarterly meetings by a committee of 14 
managing trustees.
   While the NGOs' official line is one of regret and restraint, their 
off-the-record comments tend to be resentful and, at time, vicious. 
"Nobody wants to say anything because it is politically incorrect to 
criticise the Mandela fund," said the source. 
   But Ractliffe is not exempt from criticism. He has been accused of 
trying to turn the Mandela fund into a personal empire, and of eluding 
telephone calls by NGOs attempting to establish information about the 
fund. 
   "Ractliffe is the fund," said a source. "You can't get past him."
   Ractliffe said, "I have no desire to create a personal empire. All 
the information about the Fund is freely available. People who want to 
talk to me should keep trying, because I am always here."

South African Mineworkers May Not Support Trade Union Strike

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jacquie Golding-Duffy

   Johannesburg - The Congress of South African Trade Unions cannot 
count on the support of its main affiliate, the 300 000-strong National 
Union of Mineworkers (NUM), in its planned anti- privatisation strike on 
Tuesday.
   Although, as a Cosatu affiliate, the NUM is bound to some degree by 
the federation's decision to strike, ambivalence is being displayed 
among some key NUM members.
   The strike, aimed at what Cosatu terms the "unilateral restructuring 
of state assets", could fail, with one senior unionist, who wished to 
remain anonymous, describing Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa's 
militant stance as "mere posturing".
   NUM general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe was tight-lipped about the 
strike, saying it was "inappropriate to comment", since talks between 
Cosatu and various other parties could "succeed in reconciling 
differences" and possibly reach agreement on the objectives of 
restructuring within the public and other sectors."
   "All federation decisions are binding on affiliates,'' Motlanthe 
said.
   However, should the NUM, as a backbone union of the federation, fail 
to render its support, Cosatu's "show of strength" will not make an 
impact.
   Cosatu spokesperson Nowetu Mpati said she did not doubt the NUM would 
support the strike, especially as it participated in the decision- 
making process. "The strike will continue as planned, and we have 
distributed pamphlets in all the regions," Mpati said, adding Cosatu's 
affiliates had pledged "strong support" for the strike.
   The strike is, however, ill-timed, with factory workers returning a 
day before Cosatu plans to show its "force of strength". The Federation 
of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal) also indicated last week that it 
had no intention of participating in the strike.

Taxpayers to Pay Ex-Generals' Legal Costs

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Vuyo Mvoko

   Johannesburg - The taxpayer is going to pay legal costs for former 
defence minister Magnus Malan and 10 senior officers in their murder 
trial which begins in early March in Durban.
   General Malan and his co-accused, including former SADF chief General 
"Kat" Liebenberg, are accused of complicity in the massacre of 13 
civilians at KwaMakhuta in KwaZulu-Natal in 1987.
   The indictment against Malan and the others includes allegations 
about a secret sub- committee of the State Security Council which 
approved millions of rands for training Inkatha hit squads in the 
Caprivi from 1986.
   Malan and others were arrested after the Durban-based Investigation 
Task Unit found secret documents linking them to the training of the 
hit-squads and the execution of the massacre.
   Responding to a Mail & Guardian inquiry this week, Lieutenant-Colonel 
Damien de Lange, on behalf of the Minister of Defence, said defence 
costs of former SADF as well those of South African National Defence 
Force (SANDF) members involved in trials are and will be borne by the 
ministry. He would not explain how this decision had been reached beyond 
saying it was "at the instruction of the Treasury for Finance". He said 
he presumed the decision had been taken by the Cabinet.
   De Lange said there was no provision to recover the money if the 
accused were found guilty. He said some would probably not be able to 
pay back the huge sums involved in their defence. 
   Office of the President spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the payment 
of the defence costs of the Malan 20 was never discussed in Cabinet.
   The South African taxpayer has already paid out more than R3-million 
in legal costs for the defence of former policeman, Vlakplaas commander 
Eugene de Kock, in a trial which will probably end in March.
   African National Congress spokesman Carl Niehaus said the 
organisation was "extremely uncomfortable" with the situation, but 
understood the dilemma facing the ministry, and that as long as there 
was a legal provision it was difficult for the ministry not to abide by 
it.
   However M&G has learned there is some unhappiness about the 
government paying for the defence of Malan and his co-accused in the 
recently formed Secretariat for Defence. The Secretariat was established 
to ensure civilian accountability in the military.

BP Chooses First Black Exec to Lead Africa Division

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lynda Loxton

   .TEXT  Johannesburg - Frederick Phaswana, the new chairman and chief 
executive of British Petroleum Southern Africa (BPSA) and head of BP's 
13-country Africa Division, is no cosmetic, affirmative action 
appointee, but a BP man through and through.
   This was borne out by the roar of approval that met the news of his 
appointment at the group's Cape Town offices from people he had worked 
with for more than 30 years.
   Not only is he the first South African to run the Southern African 
operation, but he is the first black man appointed to head one of BP's 
five regional divisions.
   The son of a tailor and a domestic worker, he was born in the 
Northern Transvaal town of Louis Trichardt in the heart of conservative 
white Afrikaners.
   A bright pupil, Phaswana was sent to a Calvinist training college for 
primary school teachers at Bethesda near Pietersberg at the age of 13.
   On completing Form Two, he went on to another church-run school, 
Emmarentia High School to complete his school leaving certificate.
   But his stay at the school was prematurely halted when, three months 
before he was due to write his finals, he was expelled. The pupils had 
been protesting against the creation of the Republic of South Africa and 
some were woken up at two in the morning. Torches were shone in their 
faces and rifles poked in their ribs.
   "They were only doing their job," Phaswana said without any 
bitterness.
   "I wasn't hurt or anything like that. I was just rounded up with 10 
others in my class, told to dress and put on a train back to Louis 
Trichardt.
   "They told me that I would not be able to write my finals, even to 
finish school at all, unless I joined the police or the civil service, 
of course."
   But Phaswana had registered to write his finals and had an 
examination number, which was all the examiners needed. So he was sent 
to a school in a rural area where he wrote his matric, obtaining a 
university exemption.
   Because he was good at languages, Phaswana set his heart on a degree 
leading to a career in court interpreting. His brother agreed to help 
him finance his studies, but either forgot his promise or found it too 
difficult.
   Anxious not to lose a good student, the university of the North 
contacted the then joint service company run by BP and Shell and 
arranged a bursary. The two companies set up in their own right in 1974.
   He went on to study part-time for an Honours degree in energy 
economics through Unisa and for a Masters degree in Dutch literature 
through Rand Afrikaans University. 
   In the meantime, he needed a job and went to the oil company saying: 
"Listen here, you gave me a bursary, now give me a job." The company was 
somewhat taken aback, but agreed to take him on in its personnel 
department.
   "I hadn't a clue about BP, personnel or anything else, so I asked 
what it was they did. When I gathered that they sat in an office and 
made plans for the chaps working at the bottom of the organisation, I 
said; 'Well, if that is what I am going to be doing, I think I had 
better go out there and work with the people on the ground. Then maybe I 
would become a better personnel officer.'"
   Phaswana rolled drums in depots and filled rail tank cars for some 
years but by 1973 he was a personnel officer and identified as a fast 
tracker. By 1988, he was appointed a general manager responsible for 
various portfolios.
   Phaswana was appointed to the board of BPSA in 1989, and in 1992 he 
became president of BP Nederland and BP Belgium, based in Amsterdam and 
Brussels.
   On the question of black advancement, Phaswana said that whites had 
little to fear from their black colleagues. Rather than complain about 
the lack of black skills, they should acknowledge that they themselves 
had been living in a restricted business environment.
   "In developing black staff, we have perhaps not applied ourselves as 
hard as we should," Phaswana said.
   "It is a difficult problem, but we could have moved faster, more 
fundamentally. There is headroom for everyone to grow now and that is 
perhaps different from the past."
   Phaswana takes over at a time when the South African oil industry is 
undergoing fundamental restructuring and he is under no illusions about 
the size of the task that faces him.
   After years of tight secrecy and government regulations covering 
virtually every aspect of the business, deregulation and a greater 
openness have become the order of the day.
   One of the most contentious issues in the industry is continued 
government subsidies to oil-from-coal producer Sasol. Even though these 
are being gradually scaled down, the fact that they continue to exist at 
all has been a bone of contention.
   "We in BP do not have a problem in investing in the new refining 
capacity the market will soon demand," Phaswana said. "The caveat is how 
you do this when the playing field, set by government essentially, is 
uneven."

South Africa
Rain Water Economic Growth

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Simon Segal
  
   Johannesburg - The South African Agricultural Union (SAAU) estimates 
that the good rains, should they continue into March could add 1,5 
percentage points to South Africa's economic growth rate in 1996 (and 25 
percent to South Africa's gross agricultural income of R30-billion in 
1995).
   This will account for around one-quarter of total economic growth in 
1996. It will also raise agriculture's contribution to gross domestic 
product (GDP) from 4,6 percent in 1995 to more than six percent.
   The only region in South Africa not to benefit from the rains are 
parts of the Northern Transvaal.
   The main beneficiary of the rain is the maize industry which is now 
looking forward to a crop of seven to 10-million tons. Last year's crop 
was 4,4-million tons. Local consumption is around seven million tons, so 
South Africa should be able to export maize this year and restore its 
stockpile.
   The wheat crop is estimated at 2,3-million tons (1,8-million last 
year) which should cover domestic consumption. Horticultural output is 
expected to grow 10 to 12 percent, while animal production should remain 
constant as herds are rebuilt.
   Despite the rains, the SAAU does not expect food prices to drop over 
the year as demand picks up when world food stocks are at their lowest 
levels in 30 years.
   Those foods that South Africa exports - mainly fruit and wine - could 
see price rises of over 10 percent. Other price rises should average 
around 10 percent.
   The rains will also not reverse the narrowing trade gap between 
agricultural imports and exports. In 1994, when South Africa enjoyed a 
bumper agricultural season, agricultural exports totaled R8,3-billion 
and imports R4,9-billion. The Agricultural department reckons in 1995 
exports were up 15 percent (to R9,5-billion) and imports 20 percent (to 
R6- billion). The rise in imports was largely due to loopholes in meat 
importation which has subsequently been tightened.
   For 1996 the "guesstimate" is for exports to rise 10 percent (to 
R10,5-billion) and imports to increase by 15 percent (to R6,8-billion). 
The trend is clear - in a deregulating agricultural industry, imports 
are increasing at a more rapid rate than exports.
   So the rains will bring more food, although not cheaper, and 
contribute favourably on a net basis to South Africa's balance of 
payments.

South Africa
Expensive Oil-from-Gas Plant Presents Conundrum

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Aspasia Karras 
  
   Johannesburg - Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, the old 
stalwart of the South African political theatre, Pik Botha openly 
concedes that Mossgas was a purely strategic investment that made 
absolutely no economic sense. 
   In fact, so categorical is he that he wryly points out, "If this had 
happened in a private company, the board of directors would have been 
fired." 
   Barring the irony, the statement about one more apartheid white 
elephant, is illustrative of the current privatisation debate. 
   The gas into oil conversion plant doubled its projected costs, so 
even though the plant is now producing a cash profit, it will never 
manage to put a dent in the R11-billion that it eventually cost the 
state. This, however, is history. 
   Botha concedes that he would never have taken that cabinet decision 
again; the question that now prevails is, what to do with it, and who 
should do it?
   A brief summary of the "conundrum", as cabinet has characterised the 
issue, is difficult. 
   Mossgas and the Central Energy Fund (CEF) are pushing for an 
investment of R840-million in the Mossgas plant, in order to develop 
satellite fields and to introduce compression, from which they expect to 
yield a net income of about R2,5-billion in 26 months. 
   These figures have been challenged on the basis that the projected 
income was taking into account artificial elements, like tariff 
protection, and synfuel levy, which in light of the deregulation and 
rationalisation of government involvement in liquid fuels, is falsely 
premised. 
   The monitoring committee has opposed this, although it is prepared to 
contemplate limited compression, and has demanded that a survey of the 
marketability of Mossgas be undertaken. 
   The prospective buyer, or "invisible man", is being negotiated with 
the appointed consultants Rand Merchant Bank and international 
consultants Arthur D Little.
   Some of the prospective buyers include: a troika composed of Sasol, 
Sentrachem and AECI, who plan to convert Mossgas into methanol 
production; an elusive Taiwanese option that brings into focus South 
Africa's continued flirtation with the wrong part of China; Sasol; 
Gencor; and even a recent suggestion from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki 
that Malaysia is willing to bid. 
   The deadline for the consultants to make a judgment call is the end 
of February, and while Botha is reluctant to estimate a price tag, what 
he does say is that a decision needs to be taken urgently on whether to 
invest, as the oil well is about to run dry. 
   The projected 25-year supply has dwindled to a mere five which means 
that the elephant will lose even more investment appeal, if production 
stops altogether in 1997 and Mossgas loses its cash-positive position. A 
decision on whether to invest the R840-million is of dire necessity
   The question needs to be asked: why should the government privatise 
if there is an option of relative profitability? Neil Morrison of Rand 
Merchant Bank states that "To proceed with privatisation or changing the 
role of the state, it must demonstrably lead to tangible benefits for 
the various stakeholders, in particular labour and the historically 
disadvantaged."
   Wielding his double-edged sword, Botha is the first to concede that 
oil is one of those strategic trump cards for any country, and yet 
questions the rationale of state involvement in industries in which it 
has very little expertise, resources and skill. 
   The much-slammed Moseneke report, as well as the upcoming Cosatu 
strike, bring the question into bold relief. 
   In determining the country's long-term interests, the urgency of 
certain decisions takes on tragic proportions. Botha attempts to resolve 
the conundrum with a typical rough and ready, diplomatic answer, "Prize 
number one, for me is to sell it but also to negotiate that the new 
owner produces a new product, so as to continue to generate economic 
stability and development in that part of the country."
   He is full of those grand Rhodes-like visions, for development, 
eloquently conjuring up images of the Southern African Power Pool 
agreement to develop the Zaire rapids, solar power projects to be 
facilitated by the CEF, and tourist attractions in the Soutpan. 
   But most evidently the question of what is really in the country's 
good still troubles him. "Do you save on foreign exchange and earn 
income on fuel, or go for the jobsaving option that a conversion to 
methanol would provide? Perhaps a combination is more viable by 
retaining the state interest in part.
   "The argument could also follow a different route, create long-term 
viability, but lose foreign exchange and suffer temporary job losses."
   He is clear about electricity, though, "It is not in our interest to 
privatise, there needs to be centralisation, our status quo is a result 
of the fragmentation, there exist over 300 suppliers, and 2 000 tariffs, 
there is no clarity or security for potential investors. I have great 
faith in Dr Ian McRae (head of the National Electricity Forum) - he is a 
man of vision and imagination."
   It is probably imagination that is needed in the question of 
privatisation. Morrison argues, "Government has to make the choice 
whether to squander the future as a competitive economy or to make hard 
adjustments right now. Policy matters, the decisions government makes, 
affects directly which shareholders benefit and which don't."
   As to Mossgas, Rand Merchant Bank is still mum, arguing that it is 
premature to comment. 
   Botha, in a pithy allegory, sums it up by quoting a phrase that ex-
cabinet minister Piet du Plessis has on his prison wall, "In die konsert 
van die lewe is daar geen program nie" which Botha then slyly adapts to 
"In die konsert van Mossgas is daar geen program nie."

Soccer: Cameroon Lion Meet Home Team in Cup Openers

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Lungile Madywabe
  
   Johannesburg - South Africa opens the 20th African Nations Cup finals 
on Saturday with a tough clash against Cameroon at the FNB Stadium in 
Johannesburg, and in the Group of Death - the other teams are Egypt and 
Angola -- every point will be vital.
   Because of the recent problems the Federation of Cameroon Football 
(Fecafoot) has had with Fifa over the government's interference with the 
election of Fecafoot members - coupled with the bad result on the field 
-- Cameroon come here as underdogs. 
   But it must not be forgotten that six years ago Cameroon stunned the 
world when they beat two-time world champions Argentina in the opening 
match of the World Cup in Italy. Cameroon sank Argentina with a first-
half goal, and doggedly -- with nine men -- they defended until the 
final whistle to record a historic victory. 
   Rated as the "no hopers" in Italy, the west African country got the 
result that was to give African teams the respect they deserve on the 
international stage. 
   African champions in 1984 and 1988, and quarter-finalists in 1990 in 
Italy, the players of the Indomitable Lions will more than likely be 
able to withstand the pressure of the occasion on Saturday afternoon. 
   To use the words of one soccer official, 10 seconds before the game 
the South African players would have sweated three times more than their 
opponents. The simple reason is that Bafana Bafana have never played 
such an important match since their arrival back in the international 
arena. 
   But much has also changed since South Africa first took those first 
tentative steps back onto the international stage. South Africa can 
boast a run of seven unbeaten games this year and include in their line-
up of seasoned strikers the likes of Wolverhampton Wanderers' Mark 
Williams and Philemon "Chippa" Masinga of Leeds United. 
   However both remain doubtful starters. Masinga will only arrive on 
Friday as Leeds played a cup game on Wednesday and Williams sustained an 
ankle injury doing duty for his team last weekend. 
   National coach Clive Barker seemed undisturbed, saying: "I am sure 
everyone will be fit for Saturday." Williams may be fit but Masinga 
playing after 10 hours on the plane would be asking too much. 
   Previously players and officials have used jet-lag as an excuse for 
bad performances, but with so much to play for one hopes that there will 
be no silly excuses. 
   Neil Tovey, the South African captain affectionately known as 
"mkhukhu", will have to marshal his defence against the likes of 
Francois Omam Biyick, Augustine Simo, Alphonse Tchami who now wears the 
famous number nine Roger Milla jersey. 
   Cameroon coach Jules Nyongha will pin his hopes on the dazzling 
midfielder Roger Feutumba to exploit any South African weaknesses. 
Feutumba played for Mamelodi Sundowns for most of this year so he has 
experience of local conditions and players. 
   With injury doubts about their forwards South Africa go into this 
game without too many attacking options and Daniel Mudau, who came in as 
a late replacement for Sean Dundee, is also suffering from an ankle 
injury.
   Shaun Bartlett, who made his debut for South Africa in the recent 
Simba Four Nations Cup, will have to test his abilities against the big, 
strong Cameroon defence. 
   One thing that still baffles me is why the enterprising Umtata Bucks 
striker Brendon Augustine was left out. He last wore South African 
colours when he scored an equaliser against Mozambique in a friendly.
   Comforting news is that Barker said he would call on him should the 
worst come to the worst. The winger Helman Mkhelele should be a constant 
menace down the line if he is played.  
   Their financial problems aside, Cameroon are sure to give South 
Africa and their supporters a run for their money. The two teams have 
met four times, sharing the spoils twice, with South Africa winning one 
and Cameroon taking the other. 
   The tournament is played in a round robin system, with three points 
for a win. The top two teams in each group will go through to the 
quarter-finals. 
   At this knockout stage, in the event of a draw after full time, 30 
minutes extra time will be played followed by a penalty shootout if the 
two teams are still even.

Sailing: Yacht Rises To The Occasion

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) 
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jonathan Spencer Jones

   Cape Town - CAPE TOWN put on her finest with an almost windless 
morning giving way to a fresh 20-knot south-easterly for the start of 
the Rothmans Cape to Rio on Saturday, and hundreds of well-wishers 
lining the seashore and on craft from jet skis to ocean-going tugs 
turned out to cheer the fleet on its way.
   For the 46 entrants -- eight of the smaller yachts having taken the 
early start on January 2 -- the weeks and months, and in some cases 
years, of preparation came to fruition with the firing of the start gun 
by Deputy Minister of Defence Ronnie Kasrils at 3pm, and they were led 
off by the Whitbread 60 Corum Meteorite skippered by Frenchman Pierre 
Mas and German Hasso Plattner's hi-tech ILC 70 Fancourt's Morning Glory 
down to the first mark off Granger Bay.
   Rounding just astern of Corum Meteorite, Fancourt's Morning Glory's 
spinnaker was the first to fly, however, and she surged ahead to lead 
round the second mark off Mouille Point -- and take the newly instituted 
Telkom Trophy as the first yacht to do so -- before setting a westerly 
course to clear Robben Island to seaward.
   First of the South African entries round the second mark was the new 
Simonis 60 Warrior skippered by Rick Nankin, but opting instead to take 
full advantage of the south-easter, led the majority of the remainder of 
the fleet out of Table Bay on the "traditional" spinnaker run inshore of 
Robben Island.
   The fleet soon started to spread, however, and by the end of the 
first day at sea, during which Fancourt's Morning Glory covered a 24- 
hour race record of 330 miles, some 150 miles separated the maxis from 
the smallest yachts at the rear, with Warrior marginally in the lead on 
handicap.
   But day two belonged to the Lavranos-designed 77-foot maxi Daly's 
International Insurances skippered by Mike Daly sailing a more westerly 
course than the leaders and notching up 296 miles to put her into the 
lead on handicap, before reverting to the more north-westerly routing as 
her wind ran out.
   By the end of the third day, Fancourt's Morning Glory had 
consolidated her lead to almost 40 miles ahead of a neck-and-neck 
Nicorette skippered by Swede Ludde Ingvall and Corum Meteorite following 
a slightly more southerly route, as well as moving into first place on 
handicap, four minutes ahead of Nicorette, while Warrior had slipped to 
fourth, behind third-placed Wizard with Jan Reuvers at the helm showing 
her form after a slow start.
   In the cruiser monohull class, Durban yacht Dream Reach skippered by 
Colin Bryson held a marginal lead over Richard Holloway's Aquacoco, 
while in the multihull class, Colin Kenny's catamaran Manx -- sporting a 
revolutionary unstayed carbon fibre rig -- had moved into first place 
ahead of early leader Basic Instinct skippered by Kieran Draper.

Cricket: Winning Team Has Some Problems to Solve

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Jon Swift
   Johannesburg - There is a time for reappraisal and reassessment in 
every sphere of diverse activity the universe has thankfully thrown our 
way. Such must surely be the case in the light of the truly heroic klap 
Hansie Cronje and his side gave the Poms over three glorious days of 
Cape sunshine.
   And equally gratifying to finally break this country's one-day duck 
after four abortive attempts against England in a stirring victory at 
the same venue just five days later.
   Right now, despite concerns about the brittle quality of the top 
order, there is the no doubt sage advice to the effect of the "if it 
ain't broke, don't fix it" variety being applied. This unquestioning 
philosophy has some merit, but there are some areas which can be 
addressed immediately before it all gets broke faster than anyone can 
fix it.
   The first is surely the question of a back-up wicketkeeper at 
national level. This is a priority both for the incumbent, Dave 
Richardson, and the future of the national team. Richardson has played 
every test since this country's readmission from the years of self-
imposed darkness and, it must be added, played every one with 
distinction. He has borne an unenviable task with equanimity and taken 
the pressures which have so often been thrust unwillingly on him low 
down the order with dignity and calm.
   But it also cannot be denied that at 36 he is getting very close to 
his sell-by date. It is time, perhaps, to use the lateral thinking that 
has so often been lacking in all this country's sporting endeavours to 
this particular problem which is fast closing in on the selectors.
   We have had any number of pretenders to Richardson's crown. Erroll 
Stewart has come and gone. Steve Palframan has come and gone and then 
come again. Gerhardus Liebenberg was offered a brief flirtation, and 
youngsters like Nick Pothas and Paul Kirsten are waiting in the 
provincial wings.
   Palframan is the heir apparent as the incumbent South Africa "A" - 
such an exercise in alphabetic semantics this name for a team - and 
among the 20 named for the initial World Cup squad. One must question 
his ability close to the stumps against a spinner like Paul Adams 
though. Adams is going to be around for a while. The man behind the 
stumps will have to grow with him.
   And why, too, did Palframan not do exactly what Richardson did when 
Adams had him floundering and ask the teenage wrist spin wonder to 
explain what he was doing?
   Richardson's perception of the Adams wiles improved dramatically 
after an on-pitch conflab at Newlands. For the reserve side against 
England at Kimberley, Palframan never quite seemed to get the hang of 
it.
   Liebenberg, one feels, will never wear the wicketkeeping gloves with 
any real panache, although there can be little doubt that he has a fine 
future as a batsman.
   Pothas is rapidly improving behind the stumps under the tutelage of 
Ray Jennings at Transvaal and has a maiden ton against the English to 
show that his batting is coming on in leaps and bounds.
   Kirsten has all the pedigree and the competitive nature of his 
pedigree and one feels that he will one day take the step that the 
Kirsten family seem to regard as a natural progression.
   But none of them look really ready to step in if Richardson decides 
to call it a day ... and yet there is an answer if the selectors look 
past the obvious.
   Rudi Steyn has all the credentials even if it is a while since he has 
stood behind the stumps. He kept wicket with some distinction for South 
African Universities and has also been considered good enough to open 
the batting for this country. He also has the advantage of nine years on 
Richardson.
   Steyn is, in perhaps a different light, the type of multi-discipline 
player coach Bob Woolmer is on record as saying he is looking for.
   The multi-discipline approach has already thrown up Shaun Pollock, 
Jacques Kallis and - if you include his batting heroics with Dave 
Richardson in the 73-run last wicket stand which ultimately was a major 
factor in winning the test and series at Newlands - Paul Adams.
   On Adams, several volumes have already been written about a man who 
has yet to reach his 19th birthday and play a hat-trick of test matches. 
   There are still some patently raw patches about him which a career 
slated to be a long one will surely iron out. 
   The unique strangulated action and a control far beyond his years are 
always going to give opposition batters problems.
   But Adams, who has already learnt to disguise his grip, needs to 
concentrate on the speed of his run-up for the arm ball he bowls so 
well. His pace quickens perceptibly up to the wicket and makes it easy 
to pick.
   The youngster also needs to learn that the simplest way to get the 
ball to loop up to the bat is to deliver from half a yard (it is after 
all an imperial game) short of the crease. 
   These fairly simplistic things he will learn. He is too good a player 
to ignore them.
   Pollock, too, has been a revelation. He has a superb action and the 
fire to take the batsman on physically which makes a great fast bowler. 
Surely, this cannot be argued after his five- wicket haul at Newlands. 
Or his four for 34 in the opening one-day encounter against England at 
the same venue.
   Grafted onto this is a growing confidence in his undoubted ability 
with the bat shown in the stand at Kingsmead with Allan Donald and the 
sparkling 66 off a like number of balls in the 50-overs match at 
Newlands.
   Kallis, while he does not have the pace of a Pollock or a Donald or 
indeed the frustrating guile of Adams, is a more than useful medium 
pacer and will only grow in this department as his test experience is 
rounded out.
   But there remains one point to consider. The pressure on Kallis with 
the bat is far more intense than the pressure on the Cape 20-year- old 
with the ball. 
   And one senses that while Pollock and Adams have been allowed to play 
their natural games, Kallis has operated under the severe restrictions 
of a preconceived game plan and his place in the batting line-up.
   It returns us to the use of lateral thinking. Kallis is naturally 
aggressive with the bat and equally at home in the troublesome No 3 
spot. Against England in the decider in Cape Town he was neither. And 
this with Hansie Cronje battling to find anything approaching the form 
he is capable of.
   Talent, it is true, will come through eventually, but placing 
shackles on it either slows the growth or stunts it altogether. Giving 
Kallis a freer rein while impressing him with his responsibilities at 
the crease could have been one solution. 
   Moving him up an order which has stuttered and started at the top end 
is another.

South Africa
Cape Town Presses Olympic Bid

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Julian Drew 

   Johannesburg - Eleven cities will go to the starting blocks in the 
race to host the 2004 Olympic Games, it was revealed in Lausanne on 
Wednesday. That was the deadline set by the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) for the filing of candidatures at its headquarters in 
Switzerland.
   Until Wednesday it was like trying to predict the outcome of a race 
without knowing who the runners would be but the contestants are now 
clear-cut in the bid to secure the IOC's nomination in September 1997. 
Besides Cape Town the other cities are: Athens, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, 
Lille, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Seville, St 
Petersburg and Stockholm. 
   Although there had been much speculation about a Chinese bid, either 
from Beijing, who lost out narrowly to Sydney in the bid for the 2000 
Olympics, or Shanghai, they declined to file, much to the relief of 
South Africa. 
   Whether the mandarins in the politburo were too disheartened with the 
unfathomable workings of the IOC after losing with what they had 
incorrectly considered a winning ticket, or they were simply making way 
for their "comrades" in Africa, remains to be seen. But with China out 
of the way South Africa should have sole sway over the emotional and 
political votes. And, provided this country can deliver a competent 
technical bid, those votes should be enough to see the Games come to 
Africa for the first time. 
   Chris Ball, chief executive officer of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic 
Bid, was upbeat about Cape Town's chances, but he warned against 
complacency. "I believe every single candidate must be taken seriously. 
There are still 21 months of this process to go and a lot can still 
happen. There have been surprises in the past.
   "For example, in the contest for the Winter Olympics when Lillehammer 
won it was not the favourite. Therefore one should never discount one's 
competitors, " said Ball. 
   Obviously it is prudent to avoid counting your chickens before 
they've hatched for past experience has shown that the only certainty is 
that there are no sure-fire favourites where the members of the world's 
most exclusive club are concerned. 
   For historical reasons Athens was considered to be a foregone 
conclusion to host the Centennial Olympic Games this year but lost out 
to Atlanta through what many believe was the Coca-Cola factor. Also, 
1988 hosts Seoul were considered no match for Nagoya and Mexico City was 
thought to be the least likely of the four candidates for the 1968 
Olympics because of its altitude. 
   South Africa has much going for it in terms of "the missing ring" 
factor which refers to Africa (represented by the black ring among the 
five Olympic rings) never having hosted the Games, together with the 
enormous amount of goodwill that exists towards this country at the 
moment. 
   But there are also issues which will favour some of the other cities. 
South America has never hosted the Games, which could favour Buenos 
Aires or Rio. 
   South Africa should be able to count on Africa's 19 members among the 
IOC's full complement of 106 but with Istanbul bidding for the second 
time, six of Africa's 19 votes could join an Islamic block if talk of 
block voting is to be believed. 
   Rome can be expected to mount a strong challenge with the powerful, 
although not necessarily popular, athletics supremo, Primo Nebiolo, 
leading the hunt for votes - something he has proved rather adept at 
when ensuring his own position. 
   But Rome has hosted the Games before, as has Stockholm. The Swedish 
capital will pose a threat with its superb array of infrastructure 
already in place together with a proven record of efficiency and a 
national environmental policy without equal. But providing South Africa 
does its homework properly it is difficult to see it losing. 
   "Our responsibility is to make sure that we submit a very 
professional technical plan. We must not rely on emotion. We must 
compete and be professional and that's what we intend to do," said Ball.
   "We want our technical bid to be as competent as anybody's and I hope 
that we will then be able to persuade people not only that Cape Town is 
the best place to have the Olympic Games in 2004, but also that there is 
validity in the concept that an Olympics in Southern Africa can make a 
major impact on the socio- economic and socio-political future of this 
part of the world."
   Socio-economic impact is perhaps the greatest worry for most South 
Africans, particularly the residents of the Western Cape. Many people 
believe that the Games will prove to be an economic extravaganza the 
country can ill afford and that the taxpayer and ratepayers will end up 
footing any deficit.
   Ball and his committee are well aware of such perceptions. "We are 
starting a proactive approach in Cape Town which will be extended 
nationally to give more details of the real facts, our capability and 
the excitement of the bid. Until now we've tended to keep our heads down 
and deal with the preparation of the physical product. That was a policy 
decision. We felt that we couldn't go ahead and make a noise until we 
were satisfied we were on absolutely firm ground. We are now quite sure 
that we are on firm ground," said Ball. 
   What the South African public is going to want reassurance about is 
the cost of the bid, but if the preliminary operating budget is accurate 
there is no need for alarm. It is predicted that the total revenue for 
the Games from television rights, sponsorships and ticket sales will be 
R4,21-billion which will produce a net surplus of R94 million after the 
Games are over.
   These revenues have made allowance for R504- million to go towards 
the provision of facilities in a total capital expenditure budget of 
R1,761-billion of which only R978- million will come from central 
government. 
   These funds from government are required to upgrade the road and rail 
system in Cape Town and would have to be spent at some time in the 
future anyway. The government is therefore only being asked to bring its 
funding forward to assist with the staging of the Games. 
   This means a shifting in the priorities of some of the government's 
transport budget but in terms of the benefits of staging the Games it 
will be more than worthwhile. The bottom line for the ratepayers of Cape 
Town is that the Games will not cost them anything and they will be left 
with an excellent set of sporting facilities and a much improved 
transport infrastructure. 
   Of course this scenario relies on the assumption that Ball and his 
team have got their sums right. But with R2,5-billion in television 
rights already guaranteed (more than was budgeted for) from NBC's 
television deal with the IOC late last year and a well tested IOC 
marketing programme, much of the revenue is assured irrespective of 
where the Games are held. 
   The trick is going to be in keeping the cost of sports facilities to 
a minimum while still meeting the requirements of the International 
Sports Federations. Cape Town's operating budget is lower than Atlanta's 
(R5,69-billion) but higher than Sydney's (R3,46-billion at the time of 
bidding). Such figures can be misleading though because they do not 
always include the same things and the viability of Cape Town's figures 
will only really be put to the test when they are reviewed by the IOC's 
Evaluation Commission. 
   On January 23 the bidding cities will be briefed by the IOC in 
Lausanne on the electoral procedure. They will then have to finalise 
their bid books containing the technical details covering 19 different 
themes relating to the staging of the Games. 
   These must be submitted to the IOC by August 15 and then towards the 
end of September the Evaluation Commission will begin its inspection 
visits to the candidate cities. The commission will present a report to 
the IOC next February and four of the 11 cities will be nominated as 
finalists for the bid. 
   These four cities will then be allowed to canvass the members of the 
IOC and the host city will be selected in a secret ballot at the IOC 
session in Lausanne on September 5 1997. 
   Ball and many others believe the Games are an economic opportunity 
South Africa simply cannot afford to miss. Certainly the staging of the 
Games provided a major boost to the economies of Japan and Korea which 
went on to become major world players. But by the same token Mexico also 
held the Games and has remained very much a Third-World economy. Only 
time will tell which route South Africa will take?

U.S. Lawyers Advise on Constitution.TEXT 

The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 9, 1996 (19960109) 
by Masautso Phiri 

   Lusaka - Two American public lawyers have praised the preamble and 
provisions of the 1991 Zambian constitution on press freedom and freedom 
of speech which they say echoes similar sentiments in the American 
constitution.   But they have advised Zambians to debate openly if such 
provisions are to become a reality.   "I am speaking as an outsider but 
I see natural rights of the individual in the words in the preamble like 
inherent, inviolable," said US lawyer David Putter.   Speaking at the 
United States Information Service (USIS) centre yesterday  in a 
discussion organised jointly by the centre and the Law Association of 
Zambia, Paul Berch and Putter pointed to some 1991 provisions which they 
said were similar to those in the American constitution.   "It is the 
principles and analyses of the American constitution which we can apply 
to the Zambian constitution. There may be parallels," Berch advised. 
"The preamble to the 1991 constitution recognised the relationship 
between the people and the government."   Putter added: "The language of 
the 1991 constitution recognises the individual person as the source of 
power." According to Putter the 1991 Zambian constitution "makes a 
strong statement which you will find in the American constitution" on 
press freedom and speech.   "Where government is based on the individual 
the scale of justice is tilted in favour of the individual and 
government has to justify its actions,"  Putter said.

Pro-Democracy Group Calls for Independent Electoral Commission 

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
by Reuben Phiri

   Lusaka - The Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) yesterday 
called on the government to seriously consider de-linking the Electoral 
Commission from government to enhance democracy.   FODEP's call comes 
barely a week after opposition parties called for the resignation of 
chairman of the Electoral Commission Justice Weston Muzyamba for 
abdicating his constitutional and legal responsibilities to the 
government. 
   FODEP alluded to this view saying even matters of extension of the 
registration exercise are being referred to cabinet by the commission.  
"Only cabinet can decide making the commission totally toothless," 
carped FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo.   Mambo accused members of the 
ruling MMD of having a "short memory" because they had agreed during the 
Cathedral meeting in 1991 that the Elections Office would be autonomous.   
"We agreed that whoever comes into power and forms government, the first 
step was to de-link the Elections Office from government," Mambo said. 
"But it seems people have short memories."   FODEP said that the 
commission has to be seen to be independent and this is paramount as 
people are identifying it with the ruling party. 
   Meanwhile, Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred 
Zulu said extension of the voters registration will not make any 
difference to the apathy that has rocked the month long exercise. He 
instead suggested the issue should be first taken to parliament to amend 
the act which he described as outdated.   "The government should amend 
all acts, rules and regulations that impede initiative in the 
registration of voters," Zulu said in an interview yesterday.

Lusaka Stock Exchange Readies ZCCM Shares

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
by Sipo Kapumba

   Lusaka - Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is finalising details which 
would lead to the listing of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) 
"B" shares.   LuSE general manager Charles Mate said in an interview on 
Monday that a lot  of work had been done so far towards achieving that 
goal and what remained was "tidying up the loose ends which are too 
numerous to mention".   ZCCM released a prospectus in February last year 
in which it stated that it would like to float 35,470,620 of its "B" 
shares on the exchange but to date they have not. And these account for 
39.7 per cent of ZCCM's total shares.   Anglo American Corporation, 
through its subsidiary company Zambia Copper Industries (ZCI) Holdings 
Limited, owns 27.3 per cent of these "B" shares while the rest are held 
by various sections of the public.    The government owns the remainder 
of the 60.3 per cent of ZCCM shares, classified as "A" shares.    Stock 
exchange analysts say the delay in listing the "B" shares was due to 
disagreements between ZCCM and LuSE about how the floatation should be 
done.   Last month discussions between the LuSE and ZCCM intensified and 
now there is speculation that the two have agreed on a date for the 
listing, but Mate  denies this. "We are working on it, but we have not 
finalised it. I can't give a date because I have not got one," Mate said 
on Monday.   He added that he was reluctant to give further details 
because any "careless and uncalculated statements could have global 
repercussions on stock markets".   But ZCCM insists all has been done on 
its part, and what remains is for LuSE to sort out."We applied for the 
listing so it is up to them to comment on the matter," public relations 
manager Francis Musonda said in an interview on Monday.
   But some analysts have questioned the wisdom of listing the ZCCM "B" 
shares on the exchange given that the company is experiencing declining 
production  and if the government sticks to its plans, it will not be 
until next year before the mines are privatised.   Theo Bull, a member 
of the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industries (ZACCI) 
said in an interview on Saturday that it would be unwise to invest in 
the shares before fundamental issues like privatisation were addressed.   
In addition he said floating the "B" shares would not have much impact 
on ZCCM because the more important "A" shares would still be in 
government control.   Stock brokers, like Finance Securities' Nduba 
Namoonde, say the listing of ZCCM shares was welcome and it would make 
the LuSE the second largest  capitalised exchange in the region after 
the Johannesburg exchange and would lead to increased business on the 
exchange. 
   Namoonde said the prospects for the company were getting better 
especially that the government has indicated that it would like to 
recapitalise the mines with the involvement of Anglo American 
Corporation. He added that investing in ZCCM when the company is not 
doing very well at the moment means that people will buy the shares 
cheaply but would be able to sell them at a profit when the company's 
fortunes change.-0-

Government Extends Voter Registration

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 11, 1996 (19960111)
by Staff Reporter

   Lusaka - THE government finally succumbed to opposition pressure 
yesterday and extended the voters registration exercise by another month 
effective today. But MMD national secretary, health minister Michael 
Sata, has advised that extensions will not be upheld forever.
   "We can not keep on extending deadlines. What happens if again people 
don't register?" Sata asked in an interview yesterday. "Such extensions 
could derail our democracy because whatever register will be in place at 
the time of the deadline must be used." 
   And announcing the extension in Lusaka yesterday Electoral Commission 
chairman Justice Weston Muzyamba said the Elections Office needed K2 
billion to pay the officers running the exercise.    "I have been 
informed by the Director of Elections that K1billion is needed for the 
work done so far and another K1billion for the period that has been 
extended, " Muzyamba said. "We have to raise this money as soon as 
possible because without it, this extension will be meaningless, the 
registration officers need to be paid."   The exercise will run until 
February 9.    Muzyamba, however, warned that the public should make 
good use of the  extension because there might "not be another after 
this one". And Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) has hailed the 
government's decision to extend the registration exercise saying it was 
a "healthy sign" 
   "It's very important to note that the government can at least adhere 
to people's demands because it would not have really augured well had 
they  ignored people's calls," FODEP secretary Bishop John Mambo said in 
an  interview yesterday.   Last week opposition parties piled pressure 
on the government urging it to extend the registration period. Mambo has 
also said "in the future, the commission must be made totally, 
independent so that decisions like those of extending should not await 
the  government approval."
   He said the commission should be independent enough to look at all 
disputes arising from the elections in order to make the whole 
democratising process more meaningful.   President Frederick Chiluba 
almost missed the deadline for the exercise in Ndola yesterday when he 
was among the last people registering on the  scheduled final day of the 
exercise.

KLM Launches Direct Flights to Zambia

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 11, 1996 (19960111)
by Masauso Lungu

   Lusaka - KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' first flight to Zambia will touch 
down at Lusaka  International Airport at 14:20 hours today.The airline 
will fly twice-weekly, on Mondays and Wednesdays, into Lusaka using an 
MD 11 aircraft. And the northbound, or return, flights will be the same 
day.   Aero Zambia managing director Mengistu Yewon-dwossen has welcomed 
the KLM flights to Lusaka as a boost to the country's tourism 
industry."The flights will bring in a lot of tourists in the country 
from Europe and that will be beneficial to the country," Yewo-ndwossen 
said in an interview.   But Yewondwossen had some 'personal' worries 
about KLM's entry into the Zambian market. " At the moment we will not 
be affected but as soon as we fly to London I think we shall be very 
much affected as it will increase competion with us, and British 
Airways," Yew-ondwossen said. "But it will give customers a lot of 
choice."   Today's KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight is expected to be met 
by communications and transport minister Dawson Lupunga, the Netherlands 
ambassador to Zambia Jan Peter Dykstra and members of the travel 
industry.   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' MD 11 is configured to carry 37 
business class passengers and 260 in the economy section

Government Forecasts Six Percent Growth

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Anthony Mukwita

   Lusaka - A finance ministry financial expert yesterday said  Zambia's 
per capita income will grow by 6 per cent per year starting this year, 
following its move from the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) to 
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. 
   The expert, Hendrick Van der Heijden, disclosed this during a State 
House-organised press briefing. 
   Heijden, however,  said the growth heavily depended on how swift the 
government moves in privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM). 
   "The current price of copper at the world market is $1.10 per pound 
and if Zambia increases to export well, the economy should be expected 
to be on track with our forecast," Heijden said. 
   He said with the availability of other exports at the export board of 
Zambia, no problem should be perceived in maintaining the growth rate. 
   "You will be surprised to find how much there is to export at the 
export board, flowers and other products, while if you visit the tobacco 
farmers, you will find them smiling because they are doing good business 
abroad," Heijden  said. 
   Zambia's graduation from SAP to ESAF is according to Heijden the 
largest contributor to the expected economic boom as it allows Zambia to 
borrow at  concessional rates. 
   But a press release by the World Bank shortly after Consultative 
Group meeting last December in Bournemouth said Zambia's external aid 
partners emphasised the vital link between good governance, economic 
growth, and improving the welfare of the Zambian people. The donors also 
registered concern on governance issues. In response, the Zambian 
government delegation reaffirmed its determination to continue on the 
path towards irreversible democratic change, including constitutional 
changes based on consensus. It also reiterated its strong commitment to 
free and fair elections. 
   But the government has continued to oppose and resist proposals by 
the opposition and civic organisations to adopt the constitution through 
a constituent assembly, insisting the parliament they dominate is the 
only legally empowered institution to do so.  
   "Everybody in Zambia is represented in parliament, and besides, only 
parliament can enact a Constitution while a constituent assembly can 
only vet some clauses," President Chiluba's public relations and press 
aide Richard Sakala reiterated the government's position at a press 
briefing at State House yesterday.

Zambians Urged to Take An Interest in Art

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Joe Kaunda

      Lusaka - A 50-year-old traditional potter has called on Zambians 
to develop an interest in art if they are expected to help preserve 
culture in the country. 
   Malita Chanda, who has more than 40 years experience in traditional 
clay pot making, said this in an interview on Wednesday at a Visual Arts 
Council (VAC) women's art workshop. 
   She said there was a need to learn simple traditional works such as  
clay pot making to help preserve our ailing cultural background. 
   "Tufwile ukusambilila ukub-umba ifya pala inongo ne fingi ifyaibela 
nga tu li no kusunga intambi shesu (We must try to learn activities like 
the moulding of clay pots and many other traditional works if we are to 
help  preserve our culture)," Chanda said in a local lunguage, Bemba. 
   Chanda, who is also a leading marriage counsellor in Lusaka, had been 
invited to teach women artists participating in the VAC women's art 
workshop skills in traditional pottery which she learnt while in her 
village in Kasama. 
   The workshop, which ends today, was organised to facilitate the 
exchange of ideas of women in the field of arts and attracted 22 women 
participants drawn from all provinces in the country. 
   At the same function veteran woman artist and VAC national treasurer, 
Agness Yombwe, on Wednesday revealed that the workshop concentrated on 
the exploitation of found materials (scrap material) which were 
inexpensive and readily available for use by the artist. It was  funded 
by the European Union/CICIBA at a cost of K3.1 million. 
   The workshop will be closed tomorrow by community development 
permanent secretary, Hellen Matanda with an exhibition of the artworks 
prepared during the 10-day duration of the workshop.

[Column] Market Economy Has Made Zambians More Productive

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Mwanachonga H Chipewo (Column)

   Lusaka - Scientists have dug up theories about human behaviour and 
have rightly postulated about what can make persons become ingenious to 
achieve a predetermined goal. The democratic governance  and the market 
economic system are the panacea which unshackles man from the bondage of 
dependance and indolence to the freedoms of choice, creativity, 
resourcefulness and ingenuity. 
   The last four years of practicing democratic governance and market 
economic system have vindicated this postulate. The moment the economy 
was deregulated and all impediments to trade both local and foreign 
removed, the once seemingly unwitting populace and docile citizenry 
simply jettisoned and reverberated into the commercial activity totally 
unprecedented in the history of the nation. Under the stimuli of hunger 
and poverty, the most aggressive among the citizenry sauntered into the 
world and brought into this country anything conceivable from the 
mundane to the most sophisticated to the benefit of all. In the 
euphoria, however, confusion has reigned. 
   The elements that have been caught on the left and napping in all of 
this ecstasy are the authorities. From empirical evidence and so far as 
things are happening, it is evident that the governmental regulatory 
bodies were and are still not prepared and have lamentably failed to 
cope with the dictates of the performance of the market economic system. 
The market economic system, while priding itself on the ability to 
provide goods and services in abundance and efficiently, more often than 
not  is wrought with vices and unbecoming trade practices which can 
wreak havoc in the economy. Fair competition is healthy but unfair 
competition is not. Unfair competition utilises resources inefficiently 
and erodes profit margins which are essential to the growth of any 
business enterprise. 
   Players in the market are not capable of regulating themselves for 
optimum operations. This is where different governmental bodies dealing 
with commerce and trade come in to establish rules and regulations to 
ensure that unfair practices are eliminated.  
   What should be borne in mind is the fact that the market economy 
calls for greater responsibility on the part of both government and the 
players in the market. 
   The government acts as the referee and for as long as the referee 
plays  the part efficiently and effectively, the players in the market 
will respond accordingly. 
   As of now, these regulatory bodies in government are dormant and 
starting soon, this article will begin analysing them one by one to show 
what they should do in order to help build a vibrant commercial practice 
in the country.

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)

by Reuben Tonga
   Lusaka - Zambia lost her first game but won the second in the on-
going International Tennis Championship, the Davis Cup, in the Kenyan 
capital of Nairobi. Zambia lost to Cyprus in all the three sets but 
managed to pull off a victory over Djibouti. 
   In the first matches against the much experienced Cyprus side, 
Zambia's Kachinga  
   Sinkala lost to Alkis Papamichael of Cyprus (6, 3) (6, 0), while 
another Zambian Sydeny Bwalya was beaten by Dembertos Lenodis (7, 5 ),  
(6, 3).  
   Lighton Ndefwayi of Zambia was further crushed (7, 6), (6, 4) by 
Dembertos  Lenodis. 
   In the matches against Djibouti, Zambia's Kachinga Sinkala beat Aden 
Ali (6, 0), (6, 0). Sydeny Bwalya defeated Nasr Changwau (6,1), (6, 0) 
while Martin Kombe clinched victory over Abdoulkader Abdoulkader (6, 1), 
(6, 3). 
   Other teams that played in the tournament include hosts Kenya who 
beat Botswana, Estonia who beat Moldova and Greece who trounced Togo. 
   Ireland won over Djibouti and Monaco lost to Bulgaria. 
   Zambia Tennis Association general secretary Austin Fuliwa has however 
hailed the performance of the Zambian team in the Davis Cup. 
   "This is the equivalent of the soccer world cup and beating some 
teams for our players  is a very great effort, considering also that 
none of these players play professional tennis," Fuliwa said in an 
interview yesterday 
   Zambia plays her next game against Ireland tomorrow.

Sao Tome and Principe
President Selects Unity Cabinet

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Sao Tome - A national government of unity has taken over in Sao Tome 
and Principe after being appointed by President Miguel Trovoada to 
tackle the economic and social ills facing this former Portuguese 
territory off the coast of West Africa.
   The 12-member team headed by Prime Minister Vaz d'Almeida took over 
on January 5 but was not expected to endure much beyond presidential 
elections scheduled for March 3, only a month before Trovoada's mandate 
expires in April.
   The new government includes six members of the former Movement for 
the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP/PSD), which holds the 
majority in parliament and four ministers from the Independent 
Democratic Alliance (ADI) which backs Trovoada. One other minister is 
from the Democratic Opposition Coalition (CODO), which is not 
represented in parliament.
   The main opposition Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) which came to 
power in the years after the country abandoned single-party rule in 
1990, refused to join the national unity administration.
   D'Almeida on January 6 asked for a "grace period of 45 days to carry 
through some urgent measures".
   He said he would seek to "bring a new momentum to the administration 
to help the state restore its credibility" after the military coup which 
briefly unseated Trovoada last August.
   He vowed to be "rigorous and firm and to tackle the indiscipline and 
breakdown in law and order affecting the country".
   During his New Year message to the nation, Trovoada set March 3 as 
the date for presidential elections in the small Atlantic archipelago.
   Trovoada also expressed satisfaction at the outcome of inter-party 
discussions aimed at forming a government of national unity and 
thereafter named Vaz d'Almeida prime minister in place of Carlos da 
Graca.
   Vaz d'Almeida was deputy prime minister in Da Graca's outgoing 
government and is also deputy secretary general of the MLSTP/PSD 
liberation movement.
   Sao Tome and Principe, situated off the West African coast, gained 
independence from Portugal in 1975.

Ghana
Opposition Says President Must Resign 

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Accra - Two major opposition parties in Ghana have called on 
President Jerry Rawlings to resign following accusations by Vice-
President Kow Arkaah that Rawlings assaulted him during a cabinet 
meeting last month.
   Peter Ala Adjetey and Alhaji Asuma Banda, respectively leaders of the 
New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the Peoples Convention Party (PCP) told a 
press conference on January 4 that the behaviour of the president, in 
full view of the December 28 cabinet meeting, was unprecedented in the 
history of Ghana.
   Arkaah alleged that Rawlings kicked him in the groin, injured his 
left eye and tore his jacket in reaction to allegations of corruption.
   Arkaah, 68, said the violence had broken out after the president, 48, 
had walked into the meeting and accused his Vice-President of stating 
that corrupt practices went on during the regular cabinet sessions. 
"Before one could say anything, he gave me a terrible blow on the 
shoulder which sent me falling," the police document said, quoting the 
vice president.
   "I fell on my back. He began to pull me up but I would not allow him, 
so he tore up the shoulders of my jacket in the process. He then gave me 
a series of kicks in the groin," Arkaah said, adding that he never 
attempted to hit back "due to my respect for (Rawlings) as the President 
of the Republic of Ghana."
   But reading from a prepared statement, Adjetey said "the gravity of 
the act required that the president, in the interest of the dignity and 
honour of the Republic, resign his high office now."
   The incident was "not only unacceptable, but unpardonable in our 
social and cultural code of behaviour," he said.
   Rawlings' resignation is "the only way by which the dispute into 
which the presidency has fallen can be repaired," he said, urging 
Ghana's parliament to initiate impeachment proceedings against Rawlings 
should he fail to heed the resignation call.
   "The issue calls for a national, not partisan response as the matter 
goes to the very survival of the institutions of the Fourth Republic," 
it said.
   "Members of Parliament should not forget that this is an election 
year and (if they do not act) they would be left with the task of 
explaining to their constituencies why they could not take this action 
to restore the dignity of the nation," said Adjetey.
   Rawlings' National Democratic Conference currently holds 188 of the 
200 seats in parliament.
   On December 29, the cabinet confirmed that Rawlings confronted Arkaah 
on December 28 in reaction to allegations made by the vice-president 
that corrupt practices took place during ministers' meetings.
   The cabinet statement also suggested that unless Arkaah could 
substantiate his allegations, his presence on the cabinet would be 
problematic, but Arkaah has since said he would not resign over the 
issue, because Rawlings has no power under the constitution to sack his 
vice-president.
   But in his first reaction on January 8, Rawlings launched a scathing 
attack on Arkaah and asked: "How can a man who has formed an alliance 
with our opposition parties continue to be the vice-president of this 
government? He insists he can still sit in at cabinet meetings because 
the constitution says so, unless he tends to subvert the government from 
within."
   In his address during the third anniversary celebrations, Rawlings 
said the allegations of assault had soured the atmosphere for the 
Ghanaian government, its friends and potential investors.
   During the parade, watched by more than 15,000 people including 
diplomats, Arkaah sat passively beside his wife, Marian, and Rawlings 
and his wife, Nana Konadu, during the three-hour ceremony, during which 
the president took a military salute from 120 officers and 3,100 
soldiers.
   Arkaah, who had not been expected to attend, was greeted with cheers 
when his arrival was announced. Tension between the two men, who won 
elections on a joint ticket in 1992, has been common knowledge since 
early this year.
   In May, Arkaah called on Rawlings to rescind a controversial value- 
added tax, which sparked a wave of social discontent.
   A spokesman for the opposition Alliance For Change (AFC) said that 
Rawlings' behaviour was sufficient to merit his impeachment.
   "Rawlings is a disgrace to Ghana. How can a president behave this 
way?" he said. Rawlings has ruled this West African state since coming 
to power in a coup in June 1979.

Kenya
Government Agrees to Register Muslim College

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nairobi - A directive by Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi that a 
Muslim teachers' training college be registered has brought to an 
amicable end a wrangle between the country's Muslims and the Ministry of 
Education.
   The presidential order on January 9 came following a meeting between 
the Head of State and a delegation comprising prominent scholars of 
Islam, Imams and Members of Parliament at Moi's Harambee House office 
here.
   The country's Muslim community, at loggerheads with Education 
Minister Mr. Joseph Kamotho over the registration of the shs. 20 million 
(US dollars 400,000) Mombasa (coast region)-based Islamic Teachers 
College in Mikindani area, had been warned by the ministry against 
establishing any academic programme. The Muslim community had earlier on 
expressed intentions to train 104 Islamic teachers annually.
   Consequently, the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) had 
threatened to sue the government alleging religious discrimination while 
some zealots of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK) had 
declared a fatwa (death sentence) on Education Minister Joseph Kamotho.
   SUPKEM's argument was based on the fact that of the six private 
teacher training colleges in the country, five are run by Christian 
churches. They insisted that Muslims should also have their own colleges 
and charged that there is a serious shortage of trained muslims to teach 
Islamic Religious Education (RE) in schools. Most students are thus 
forced to opt for Christian Religious Education (CRE) which is more 
developed.
   Education Director Mr. Ezra Njoka had dismissed the problem as 
statistical. "We have enough teachers and we do not have the capacity to 
absorb them all. We are just not registering any more colleges," he had 
said before Moi's intervention.
   The delegation to the President's office last week was led by SUPKEM 
chairman, Prof. Al-Busaidy, who thanked the President on behalf of 
Kenya's Muslims and said there was no pre-condition for the Ministry of 
Education to employ graduates from the new college.
   The Ministry of Education plans to convert some of the 20 teachers 
training colleges it runs into secondary schools and polytechnics.
   Teachers remain some of the least paid Kenyan workers and often have 
their salaries delayed. Many Muslims however believe the government had 
blocked registration of the colleges - one at Mikindani, Coast Province, 
the other in Murang'a in Central Province - because it fears a 
connection with the IPK.
   Since its founding in 1991, the IPK has campaigned against what it 
claims to be official neglect and marginalisation of Kenyan Muslims who 
comprise about 10 per cent of the national population of 25 million 
people. Muslims, although spread out all over the country are mainly 
concentrated in the coastal region and northern parts of the country.
   On the whole, Christian-Muslim relations in Kenya have been peaceful 
but increasing suspicion seems to be rising between the two religious 
groups with the latter feeling the former are favoured by the State. 
President Moi is a Christian.
   Muslims have consequently cultivated a high media profile by 
sponsoring several programmes a week especially on the national radio.
   Although Christians have steered clear of the present controversy, 
there is no telling where the suspicion may end.
   However, by the time of going to press various reactions had been 
registered regarding President Moi's directive on the Muslim college.
   Opposition leaders and the unregistered IPK were of the opinion that 
Moi's move was merely a political ploy.
   Mombasa Mayor Ahmed Mwidani, in whose region the teacher's training 
institution is situated, supported the registration of the college 
saying the Head of State was concerned about the welfare of Muslims in 
the country.
   By January 10, students were reported arriving for enrolment for the 
1996 academic year.

Uganda
Anglican Head Reshuffles Leadership

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)


    Kampala - The head of the Church of Uganda Archbishop Livingstone 
Nkoyoyo has announced sweeping changes in the church in a move to curb 
what he called "corruption and inefficiency in the church top circles."
   The changes range from forced retirement of some of the Bishops whose 
terms have expired to forced transfer of some members of the laity.
   "Those bishops who have refused transfer should either quit or accept 
transfer," Archbishop Nkoyoyo said on January 8 in his first major 
statement published in Kampala since he came to office last year.
   In a pastoral letter entitled The Anglican Church of Uganda policy of 
work and guidelines, Nkoyoyo says the changes are meant to address 
"factors that have caused conflicts in the church leading to some 
followers quitting for emerging sects."
   The Archbishop said; "Some church leaders aim at only amassing wealth 
I will have no mercy on them." Although the Archbishop neither said when 
he would effect the changes nor named the leaders in question his 
remarks were generally understood to be reaction to the ongoing row in 
the eastern church of Uganda Busoga diocese, the biggest controversy in 
the church so far.
   Some Busoga Christians are locked up in a wrangle with their Bishop 
Cyprian Bamwoze whom they accuse of misuse of church funds.
   Bishop Bamwoze has recently rejected an appeal by Archbishop Nkoyoyo 
to consider retiring or transfer as a means to solve the crisis.
   Archbishop Nkoyoyo also said in his pastoral letter that the church 
of Uganda will soon issue its comprehensive position on general 
elections in the country scheduled for March this year.

   Receiving the water hand pumps on behalf of Ambassador Development 
Agency (ADA) which was behind their procurrement for the Makueni and 
Kitui rural beneficiaries, ADA Chairman, Dr. J.K. Yego, said the pumps 
will go a long way in benefiting "ADA outreach communities in semi- arid 
regions where water is scarce."
   In his speech, ADA Programmes Director Mr. Francis Muthoga, said the 
agency "works closely with poor communities in their endeavour to 
respond to people's spiritual and physical needs."
   The Ambassador Development Agency is a local, non-governmental 
organisation founded in 1985 and is committed to poverty alleviation in 
Kenya and beyond.

Bedie of Cote D'Ivoire.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to condemn the 
sentence imposed yesterday, 11 January, on Freedom Neruda, deputy editor

   Neruda was sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined CFA6 million

   Before his arrest on 2 January, Neruda's colleagues, Abou Drahamane 
Sangare, director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns 
La Voie, and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were also each sentenced 
on 28 December to two years in prison for "offending the chief of 
state," and fined three million CFA (US$6,000).  La Voie was also banned 
for three months.
   Their charges stem from the 18 December La Voie article which 
suggested that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer 
team ASEC by attending the 16 December African Champions Cup final, 
which the favored ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates.
   CPJ contends that the sentences handed down against Neruda, Sangare 
and Emmanuel are excessive and unjustified.  Having previously written 
to Your Excellency on 4 January regarding this matter, we strengthen our 
call for the nullification of their convictions, and their immediate and 
unconditional release.
   We welcome your comments.

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Arrest of Ivorian Journalist

Africa News Service
January 4, 1996 (19960104)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,  to President Konan 
Bedie of Cote D'Ivoire
    The Committee to Protect Journalists writes to strongly protest the 
arrest of Freedom Neruda, deputy editor of the independent opposition 
daily, La Voie, and to condemn the sentencing of his two colleagues.
   Neruda was arrested on January 2, 1996 and held for questioning. The 
next day, he was taken to an Abidjan correctional institution and 
charged with insulting the head of state. 
   Neruda was out of town when his colleagues, Abou Drahamane Sangare, 
director of publications of the Nouvel Horizon group which owns La Voie, 
and La Voie journalist Kore Emmanuel, were summoned by police on 
December 21. Upon his return on January 2, Neruda presented himself to 
authorities.
   His charge stems from the December 18 La Voie article which suggested 
that Your Excellency brought bad luck to the Ivorian soccer team ASEC by 
attending the December 16 African Champions Cup final, which the favored 
ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates. On December 28, publisher 
Sangare and reporter Emmanuel were each sentenced to two years in prison 
for "offending the chief of state," and fined three million CFA 
(US$6,000). La Voie was also banned for three months. 
   As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of our 
colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ believes Freedom Neruda and his 
colleagues have been unjustifiably imprisoned, due solely to exercising 
their right to free expression. This right is guaranteed by Article 19 
of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 
9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which, we 
respectfully remind Your Excellency, Cote d'Ivoire is a signatory. 
   CPJ strongly urges Your Excellency to immediately and unconditionally 
release Neruda. Moreover, we call for the reversal of the convictions of 
Sangare and Emmanuel, and their immediate release from prison. In light 
of Your Excellency's recent reelection to the Presidency, CPJ trusts 
that you will do your utmost to cease harassment of the independent 
press, and to ensure that journalists in Cote d'Ivoire may work free 
from intimidation and harm.
   Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.

[Document] U.S. Committee Protests Arrest of Nigerian Journalist

Africa News Service
January 4, 1996 (19960104)

   New York. - Text of Letter from William A. Orme, Jr., Executive 
Director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, to Nigerian Head-of-
State General Sani Abacha.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest 
the December 23 arrest of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-
based Tell magazine, and to condemn the recent series of attacks on the 
independent weekly magazine.
   Igiebor, recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 
1993, was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at 
his home in Lagos. He was then transported to SSS Headquarters in 
Shangisha. Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement 
without charge, and are demanding that he reveal his sources for 
articles criticizing the military government. During interrogations, 
Igiebor has repeatedly stated that he receives no financial support 
outsiders or Nigerian citizens, and that any information he receives 
arrives by mail.
   On the same date of Igiebor's arrest, SSS agents confiscated 20,000 
copies of Tell magazine's Christmas Day edition. The week before, on 
December 16, 1995, 55,000 copies of Tell were seized from Academy Press, 
the magazine's printing house. Earlier this week, on January 1, Nigerian 
security agents unsuccessfully attempted to seize this week's issue of 
Tell, and subsequently resorted to seizing the publication from Lagos 
vendors.
   Igiebor's arrest followed the December 23 raid of the home of Tell's 
managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, and the December 15 detention by 
Lagos police of Adedisi Dejo, Emmanuel Piper, Yeni Oldwolabi and Iyi 
Isaac, also reporters of Tell.
   CPJ has also documented the December 15 arson of The Guardian; the 
December 16 siege of AM News; the December 19 police assault and 
detention of four photojournalists, Peter Obe, Segun Olakitan of Tell, 
Abiodun Ajala of This Day, and Bayo Ewuoso of AM News; and the December 
20 arrest of Lagos vendor Olabisi Akintoye for possession of 
"unpatriotic magazines."
   In addition, we note with alarm the New Year's eve bombing of the 
office of the Independent Communications Network-publishers of the The 
News, Tempo, and Tempofootball-which destroyed millions of naira worth 
of property, but thankfully caused no fatalities.
   CPJ welcomes news of the release of Fred Eno, senior aide to Chief 
Moshood Abiola; Wariebe Agamene, president of the Nigerian Oil and Gas 
Senior Workers Union; Amos Idalemo, also a union official; and Sylvester 
Odion Akhaine of the Campaign for Democracy.
   However, CPJ strongly urges you to immediately and unconditionally 
release Nosa Igiebor and to launch an independent investigation of the 
aforementioned attacks on the independent press.
   We welcome your comments.

United States and Africa 
Outlook for U.S. Policy 1996 

Africa Policy Information Center 
January 10, 1996 (19960110)
 
   Washington, D.C. - The political climate in Washington will likely 
remain extremely difficult for Africa advocacy this year. Funding for 
aid, peacekeeping and other U.S. international obligations is sure to 
come under renewed attack in the second year of the 104th Congress. Many 
congressional advocates for African issues, Republican and Democratic, 
are scheduled to retire at the end of the 1996 session, notably Senators 
Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.). And it is very 
unlikely that international issues, much less Africa, will figure 
prominently in the 1996 election campaigns.
   In general, therefore--short of a catastrophe on the scale of the 
Rwandan genocide in 1994 or Somalia's disintegration in 1992-1993--it 
will not be easy to attract high-level attention to African issues, even 
when they do not involve significant funding commitments. The one 
African issue that seems likely to stay in the spotlight is the campaign 
for sanctions to promote democracy in Nigeria--if, that is, the late-
1995 momentum of grassroots involvement and media coverage is 
maintained.
   Nevertheless, the prospects are good for maintaining some level of 
constructive U.S. involvement in strengthening ongoing ties with South 
Africa. Washington will also likely play a role in selected peacekeeping 
operations such as Angola and Liberia, in promoting debt relief for 
African countries, and in a number of aid initiatives. The extent of 
active U.S. support for pro-democracy and human rights efforts in 
Nigeria and other countries, going beyond business-as-usual diplomacy, 
will depend above all on the level of public pressure and press 
attention.
   
   Economies Grow, But So Does Debt Burden
   
   Economic growth rates for Africa in 1995 and 1996 were projected to 
be in the 3% range, considerably higher than the 1.5% average of the 
early 1990s. But this still falls short of the rate necessary to keep 
pace with population growth, much less provide a basis for sustainable 
growth. Reductions in flows of external assistance, together with a 
still-mounting debt burden, pose additional obstacles. However, rising 
capital flows into South Africa and expectations of increased growth 
there and in several other countries somewhat offset these general 
trends.
   A late 1995 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development highlighted prospects for foreign investment in Africa, 
which it termed potentially the most profitable world region. But long-
term economic difficulties and new burdens imposed by economic austerity 
programs mean most of the continent's people face a grim year of renewed 
hardships.
   Proposals for further action on debt reduction, including the more 
than $35 billion Africa owes to international financial institutions, 
will be under consideration in 1996. Congress may also try to shape an 
agenda for improving Africa's trade prospects. But both initiatives will 
have to overcome apathy as well as substantive opposition to new 
proposals.
   The prospects for economic advance also depend fundamentally on 
resolving and averting violent conflicts and on building and 
strengthening democratic institutions. In terms of security, the most 
intractable and devastating conflict in 1996, as in 1995, is likely to 
be the war in southern Sudan. But implementation of peace settlements in 
Angola and Liberia was still problematic as the year began, and 
escalation of mass violence in Rwanda, Burundi or both was an ever-
present danger. The struggle for democracy against the military regime 
in Nigeria is likely to be the most prominent African issue in 1996. 
Meanwhile, human rights activists and pro-democracy groups also face 
serious repression in a number of other countries.
   
   Countries and Issues
   
   Following are brief highlights of specific areas and issues on which 
U.S. involvement may make a difference this year.
   
   Conflict (Sudan and other countries): War continues in southern 
Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are caught in conflict 
between the brutally repressive Sudanese government and the Sudan 
People's Liberation Army, which has gained military ground in recent 
months. The international community is engaged in relief efforts, but 
efforts at mediation have stalled. Regime opponents in the north as well 
as the south have called for increased international pressure against 
the Khartoum regime.
   While on a smaller scale than in Sudan, ongoing or sporadic violent 
conflict or insecurity characterizes a number of other countries, 
including Algeria, Sierra Leone, Zaire, Somalia, the Tuareg area in 
northern Niger, and KwaZulu/Natal province in South Africa.
   
   Peace agreements (Angola and Liberia): Observers are hopeful that 
implementation of the peace agreements in these two countries will move 
ahead in 1996, but further delays are almost certain and renewed 
conflict a constant threat. In Angola, the demobilization of Unita 
troops called for under the November 1994 accords has barely begun, and 
government forces are highly suspicious that the delay will be used to 
rebuild Unita military capacity. And in Liberia it is still doubtful 
whether the resources and political will are sufficient for the agreed 
disarmament of combatants.
   
   Prevention of wider conflict (Rwanda and Burundi): The situation in 
these two countries continues tense and potentially explosive. Some 1.8 
million Rwandan refugees remain outside Rwanda, mainly in Zaire, where 
officials of the former Rwandan government responsible for the 1994 
genocide still hold sway over their army and most civilians. Delays in 
prosecutions for the genocide, and threats that the refugees might 
return or be returned home forcibly, are among factors making a new 
escalation of violence possible. In Burundi, ethnic violence will likely 
continue--and possibly escalate-- despite international mediators' 
efforts to maintain a delicate coalition between the predominantly Tutsi 
military and an elected multiethnic government.
   
   Democratization (Nigeria and other countries): The campaign for 
democracy in Nigeria gained new international prominence in late 1995 
after the Nigerian military regime executed enviromental activist Ken 
Saro-Wiwa and eight of his colleagues. Nigeria was suspended from the 
Commonwealth, and support for oil and other sanctions came from a wide 
range of groups around the world. Bills were introduced in the U.S. 
Congress which fell short of oil sanctions, but did include bans on new 
investment and a freeze on personal assets of top Nigerian officials. 
Governments were slow to move on more substantive measures, which were 
vigorously opposed by oil companies. The sanctions campaign will likely 
continue to grow in 1996, but it remains to be seen whether it can 
overcome excuses for inaction by governments.
   Meanwhile, in many other countries, notably Zaire and Kenya, the pro-
democracy momentum of the early 1990s has been difficult to maintain in 
the face of both repression and other ploys by incumbent regimes. In 
some countries that have recently held elections (for example, Ethiopia, 
Cote d'Ivoire), serious questions have been raised about the fairness of 
those polls. International donors, including the United States, have 
shown far more consistency in pressing for free-market economic policies 
than they have in demanding respect for human rights and political 
participation by diverse social groups.
   
   South Africa and the continent: In 1996 South Africa is likely to 
confront increasing disagreements among labor, business and different 
political forces over how to craft social and economic policies that 
address the legacy of apartheid inequality. The Truth Commission, headed 
by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, will begin its controversial work of 
investigating human rights abuses in the apartheid era. Conflict between 
the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party may escalate 
in KwaZulu-Natal, particularly around the local government elections now 
scheduled for May.
   Meanwhile, South Africa will be forced to deal with the challenge of 
identifying appropriate roles for itself on wider African issues, such 
as Nigeria. In doing so it must avoid the twin dangers of narrow 
isolationism and condescending paternalism toward other African states. 
Like the U.S. outside the continent, South Africa neither can nor should 
attempt to resolve every crisis. Its stance on key issues, regardless, 
will be closely watched by African countries and outside powers alike.

[DOCUMENT] Security Council Condemns Killings 

United Nations Press Release
January 5, 1996 (19960105)

 ...United Nations -  The Security Council today condemned in the 
strongest terms those responsible for the daily killings, massacres, 
torture and arbitrary detention in Burundi and said they must cease 
immediately. In a statement read by its President, Sir John Weston 
(United Kingdom), the Council encouraged all States to take measures 
necessary to prevent such persons from travelling abroad and receiving 
any kind of support. It shared the deep concern of Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the situation in the country and called on all 
concerned in Burundi to exercise maximum restraint and to refrain from 
all acts of violence.
   The Council reiterated that all those who committed or authorized the 
commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law were 
individually responsible and should be held accountable. It stressed the 
importance of the International Commission of Inquiry. The Council also 
reiterated its profound concern about radio stations which incited 
hatred and acts of genocide and encouraged Member States and others to 
cooperate in their identification and dismantling.
   Expressing grave concern at recent attacks on international 
humanitarian personnel, the Council said such actions had led to the 
suspension of essential assistance to refugees and displaced persons and 
the temporary withdrawal of personnel. It underlined that the Government 
of Burundi was responsible for the security of international personnel, 
refugees and displaced persons there and called on it to provide 
security for food convoys and the humanitarian workers.
   The Council welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to ask the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata to 
discuss with Burundi officials, steps which might be taken to defuse the 
situation and said it would consider his proposal for a deployment of 
guards in light of Mrs. Ogata's mission and reports reaching him from 
the field. It asked him to consider what role UN personnel in the region 
and other support personnel might play in Burundi.
   Stressing the importance of continued attention by the international 
community as a whole to the situation, the Council encouraged Member 
States to intensify contacts and visits. It reaffirmed its support for 
the Convention of Government of 10 September 1994 -- the institutional 
framework for national reconciliation -- and again called on all 
parties, military forces and elements of civil society to fully respect 
and implement it.

Uganda
Church Leaders Issue Warnings On General Elections

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Kampala - Leaders of Uganda's Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches 
have warned against intrigue, bribery and violence during this East 
African country's first election in over a decade early this year.
   "If any evil people come to you with evil money, dismiss them like 
how Jesus did with Satan," the Archbishop of the Anglican Church of 
Uganda Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo said in a stern warning against 
bribery.
   The concern by the church leaders comes as both opposition candidates 
and those royal to the ruling Uganda National Resistance Movement liven 
up to Presidential and parliamentary elections expected to begin in 
March.
   In his New Year address the Head of Uganda's Catholics, Cardinal 
Emmanuel Wamala noted with concern "the serious disagreement" on 
Uganda's new constitution which he says may lead some people to go to 
"the bush."
   "Even (President) Museveni does not agree with some parts of the 
constitution like myself ... we should bury our differences and build a 
united Uganda," Cardinal Wamala said.
   The Ugandan Constitution which was promulgated last November 
entrenches and extends Museveni's nine-year old no-party system for 
another five years.
   Ousted Ugandan President Dr. Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress 
(UPC) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) which have formed an 
Alliance under DP. leader Paul Semogerere say a constitution which 
imposes severe restrictions on political parties virtually banning them 
during the elections is "mockery of democracy".
   "It is like two men competing in a 100-metre race. One of them starts 
50 metres away a head of the other," Paul Semogerere told APS in a 
recent interview.
   President Museveni however dismissed the Opposition which have 
received sympathy from Western donors particularly the United States as 
"Foreign Parrots".
   "Although the basic underlined principles of democracy are Universal, 
the forms which democracies take must vary from one country to the other 
 ... parroting forms from elsewhere is a disservice to the development of 
democracy in our society," Museveni said in his New Year address to 
Ugandans.
   Meanwhile President Yoweri Museveni has commended the people of 
Nyabubushozi county, Mbarara district, 270 kilometers south west of 
Kampala for embracing the "gospel of development". He was speaking at 
the area church where he attended the New Year's thanksgiving service.
   He urged the church to get actively involved in programmes geared to 
motivate the people to work and improve household incomes in the social, 
political and economic sectors in the country.
   The service was delivered by George Birungi who also reported on 
steps being taken by the church to encourage income generating 
activities.

Egypt
Muslim Militants Kill Christians

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Cairo - Armed Muslim militants killed two Coptic Christian 
agricultural workers and dumped their bodies on a nearby railway track 
where they were crushed by a train in southern Egypt, police said here 
on January 4.
   Fundamentalists from the same group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, killed a 
third person and wounded five in an attack the same day in the same 
region of southern Egypt, a hotbed of extremists battling to overthrow 
the government of President Hosni Mubarak.
   The attacks took place in Minya province near the town of Mallawi, 
300 kilometres south of the capital, Cairo.
   In the first attack at the village of Al-Idara, militants shot dead 
Jamil Saad Said and Issa Yussef Georgi, whose crushed bodies were found 
on railway tracks by villagers.
   Police said the militants had killed the two farm workers because 
they suspected them of passing information to the security services 
about extremists hiding in nearby sugar cane fields
   In the second attack, a municipal guard was killed and three of his 
colleagues as well as two civilians were injured when Jamaa Islamiyya 
activists opened fire on them in the village of Gelba near Mallawi.
   On December 29, Islamic militants shot and critically wounded a 
doctor for raping a Muslim girl in a revenge attack on his clinic which 
left a Christian male nurse dead, police said.
   A group of gunmen broke into Dr. Boutros Maxwell Boutros's clinic in 
Fikriya village, Minya province, and sprayed the clinic with bullets, 
critically injuring Boutros and killing Christian nurse Makram Subhi 
Said, 45, before escaping, police said.
   Police said Boutros had previously received threats from armed 
extremists after he raped a 17-year-old Muslim girl from nearby 
Gemaliyya village, the hometown of a local militant leader, Farid Salim 
Kerdani.
   The girl's family had agreed not to seek revenge against Boutros in 
exchange for a monetary sum, a common practice in southern Egypt, where 
violent clan feuds are frequent and "crimes of honour" are often solved 
far from the courts. But armed Muslim fundamentalists from the town had 
vowed to avenge the girl's rape, police said.
   A day earlier, Muslim militants had also killed a tractor driver as 
he cleared sugar cane from a field in southern Egypt for police hunting 
fugitive extremists, police said.
   Police had ordered a group of tractor drivers on January 4 to clear 
away parts of the cane field near Mahras village outside Mallawi town, 
after receiving reports that militants were hiding there.
   Two extremists opened fire on the tractor drivers as they worked, 
killing Shahata Abdel Aziz Mohammed, 30. Police said officers returned 
fire but the two gunmen escaped.
   Militants frequently use the high-growing sugar cane fields in 
southern Egypt as cover for ambushes and hideouts.
   The latest deaths bring to 938 the number of people who have been 
killed since March 1992, when Muslim militants began a violent campaign 
to bring down Mubarak's government.

Mauritania
New Government Installed After Premier's Sacking

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nouakchott - Mauritanian President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya 
dismissed Prime Minister Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubakar on January 2 and 
immediately named Shaikh Alavia Oulod Mohamed Khouna to replace him, 
officials announced in the capital Nouakchott.
   The new premier has been Minister for Fishing and Economy since 
February last year.
   A former Finance Minister, Boubacar had headed the government for 
four years and no reason was given for his sacking, although an informed 
source said his departure would pave way for "a more politically solid 
team" to prepare for elections.
   Mauritania's opposition has been calling for the dissolution of 
parliament since the first multiparty elections in 1992, which it 
boycotted.
   Among other demands, they want a new electoral code, an independent 
judiciary and an impartial administration.
   And on January 3, Kouna announced his new government line-up, 
drafting in four new ministers and dismissing three others, a move 
political observers said suggested a continuation of Boubakar's liberal 
economic policies, which began four years ago.
   With the exception of the Rural Development and Environment 
portfolio, given to Sow Demba, all of the key ministries -- Interior, 
Defence and Foreign Affairs -- did not change.
   The new premier was replaced in his previous post as Minister for 
Fisheries and Maritime Economy by Baba Ould Sidi.
   Entering the government for the first time were Kamara Ali Gueladio 
(Public Health and Social Affairs), Boidiel Ould Houmeid (Commerce, 
Handicrafts and Tourism) and Seniya mint Sidi Haiba (Secretary of State 
for Women's Affairs).
   The three sacked ministers were Sgnoire Ould M'Barack (Public Health 
and Social Affairs Minister), Timera Boubou (Rural Development and 
Environment) and Mariem mint Ahmed Aiche (Women's Affairs).
   The shakeup comes just two days before a national convention of the 
ruling Democratic and Socialist Republican Party (PRDS), which will be 
centred on key decisions related to upcoming legislative and 
presidential elections.
   Reliable sources here said late December that general elections 
planned for February and March 1997 could be brought forward to the 
fourth quarter of 1996, but there was no official confirmation of the 
report.
   Local newspapers said parliamentarians of the governing party had 
been told of the possibility by Boubakar at a meeting.

Burundi
Despair Growing As Country Slides Into Anarchy

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Bujumbura - Fear has gripped Burundi as the country continues to 
slide into anarchy that threatens to lead to the eruption of the endemic 
ethnic bloodbath that has continued unabated in the two former Belgian 
colonies of Rwanda and Burundi.
   Burundian politicians have expressed despair as they see their small 
central African nation sliding into anarchy, while gunmen call the shots 
at the risk of sparking ethnic bloodletting as savage as Rwanda's 1994 
genocidal war.
   "If we are not vigilant enough, our country runs the risk of total 
collapse," warned President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in his 1996 New 
Year message.
   "The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are swept 
away and defeated.
   The institutions, the numerous state services and organisations have 
the capacity to agree to work together to overcome these phenomena of 
fear, violence and uncertainty which threaten our people's future."
   He added: "I personally promise to do everything to root out of the 
state apparatus all those who are obstructing the state from operating 
normally and those who may try to sabotage it from within. The security 
forces and the administration must understand that they have no other 
raison d'etre than the protection of the interests of our people, whose 
primary interest is the right to life. In this struggle, the people must 
not be regarded as an object which can be manipulated to achieve 
whatever goals you want to attain, but as a partner, indeed the cardinal 
one," said the Burundian Head of State.
   The government radio echoed that warning on January 4 with the report 
of yet another massacre, which left seven people dead and 20 wounded in 
an attack in a southwestern town by men, some in uniform --wielding 
assault rifles and machetes.
   "The ideology of exclusion and genocide" is gaining ground and the 
economy is being destroyed, warned Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo in his 
own New Year message.
   In New York, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
resuscitated a proposal he made in 1994 for a UN standby force to be 
deployed in neighbouring Zaire, and for guards to protect relief agency 
workers in Burundi.
   He warned of "a real danger of the situation in Burundi degenerating 
to the point where it might explode into ethnic violence on a massive 
scale.
   But analysts say members of the UN Security Council are unlikely to 
heed his call, made public on January 2 and the idea of UN troops here 
is fiercely opposed by the commanders of Burundi's own armed forces.
   That raises the prospect of an unhindered civil war on the scale of 
that in neighbouring Rwanda, where Hutu extremists killed more than half 
a million men, women and children in 1994 before being defeated by an 
army of rebel Tutsi. UN troops there failed to halt the genocide.
   Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, UN special rapporteur for human rights in 
Burundi lashed out last December at the international community, saying 
the passivity of the rest of the world was largely responsible for the 
fostering civil war.
   Most of the clashes here between Hutus, who make up 85 per cent of 
the population of 5.5 million, and Tutsis, who comprise 14 per cent but 
dominate the armed forces, go unreported. Diplomats and relief workers 
put the death toll at around 30 a day -- 10,000 to 15,000 last year, 
according to the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors 
without Borders.)
   Thousands of Hutus have fled to Zaire, and even Rwandan Tutsis who 
had lived in Bujumbura since they were children have fled the capital.
   Eleven relief workers have been killed since August 1994, and a 
number of agencies, including the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC), the French-based International Action Against Famine, have 
recently suspended their operations or pulled out most of their 
expatriate staff.
   The Organisation of African Unity has discussed the probability of a 
UN-backed African force to keep the peace in Burundi, but the idea has 
been opposed by a number of influential countries in the region, such as 
Kenya, and appears to have made little progress.
   The government is a fragile coalition under Ntibantunganya, a 39-
year- old Hutu, and Nduwayo, a Tutsi. But the armed forces answer to no 
one but their commanders, and politics are increasingly dominated by 
extremists on both sides, observers say.

Malawi
State Appeals Former President's Acquittal

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
 
   Blantyre - The Malawian government has filed an appeal in the Supreme 
Court against the acquittal of former president Hastings Kamuzu Banda 
and five others on murder charges, a verdict that was seen here as the 
most controversial since the country attained independence from British 
colonial rule more than 30 years ago.
   Prosecutions Director Kamudoni Nyasulu, who led the prosecution 
against Banda over the deaths of four politicians, said January 4 he was 
appealing on points of law, pointing out that the High Court judge's 
summing up in the trial exceeded the proper bounds of judicial comment 
and made it difficult for the jury to convict the accused.
   "The judge misdirected the jury. All he was doing is to present my 
case and find faults in it," Nyasulu said of the acquittal on December 
23.
   The judge had told the seven-member jury that much of the 
prosecution's case during the five-month trial was speculative and 
circumstantial.
   Banda -- who ruled Malawi for 30 years before being ousted in 
elections in 1994 -- had been charged with conspiracy to murder along 
with his close aide John Tembo, constant companion Cecilia Kadzamira and 
three former police officers -- MacDonald Kalomba, Leston Kikaomba and 
MacWilliam Lunguzi.
   But in his ruling, Judge Mackson Mkandawire found Banda, Tembo, 
Kadzamira, Kalomba and Leston not guilty of murder and also ruled that 
Kadzamira and Lunguzi were not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct the 
course of justice.
   The jury's decision, which took just two hours to reach despite five 
months of trial, and the final verdict split the country along political 
lines, with supporters of Banda's opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) 
celebrating while many Malawians who have long been convinced of Banda's 
guilt were wondering how the jury arrived at its verdict.
   Justice Minister Collins Chizumila said after the verdict: "I haven't 
changed my mind that they are guilty. I don't know what went wrong. It's 
either incompetence or bribery. I've also heard the judge misdirected 
the jury."
   The judge had told the jury that most of the prosecution evidence was 
circumstantial and speculative. But the courtroom, packed with 
supporters of Banda's MCP, erupted with scenes of joy when the jury 
announced its verdicts and Tembo and the other accused leapt to their 
feet and gave the thumbs up sign, carrying shoulder high the senior 
British defence lawyer Clive Stanbrook.
   Banda, who once threatened to feed his opponents to the crocodiles 
during 30 years of untrammelled power in the tiny southern African 
nation, was tried in absentia because of ill-health and senility, and 
was at his house in Blantyre under Kadzamira's care.
   Tembo, believed to have been the power behind Banda as the former 
dictator became increasingly frail in recent years, told the crowd 
outside the courtroom that the verdict was "a reflection of the 
independence of the judiciary."
   The charges stemmed from the deaths in 1983 of cabinet ministers Dick 
Matenje, Aaron Gadama, John Sangala and parliamentarian David Chiwanga.
   It was officially announced at the time that they had died in a car 
accident, but an inquiry after Banda's ouster found that they had been 
battered to death, placed in a car and pushed over a cliff.
   The prosecution said the men had been murdered because they had 
become outspoken in their opposition to the misuse of government funds 
and were suspected of harbouring ambitions for power.
   A commission of inquiry after Banda's ouster had, however also 
established that they had in fact been murdered.
   The families of the four murdered Malawian politicians have also 
vowed that they would continue pressing for justice despite the 
acquittal of Banda.
   "We will continue to seek damages and find out who ordered the 
killings even if it means dying myself to find the truth," said a 
spokeswoman for the families, Mary Gadama, daughter of Aaron Gadama, one 
of the four politicians murdered in 1983. Mary leads a group of 
relatives fighting for compensation and for the murderers to be brought 
to justice.
   "How do you free murderers like that? It means in Malawi anyone can 
kill a person and get away with it. Somebody must be guilty of ordering 
the murders," she asked after the verdict was announced.
   Banda took power in impoverished Malawi after independence from 
Britain in 1964 and soon established a vice-like grip on the country, 
introducing a one-party state and ruling the country as a personal 
kingdom.
   He was accused of widespread human rights abuses while remaining an 
ally of Western nations for his staunch anti-communist stance during the 
Cold War, receiving visiting British royalty in a red Rolls Royce 
convertible and entertaining them to lavish banquets in his Sanjika 
Palace outside Blantyre.

Gambia
Junta Leader Announces Elections For June

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Banjul - Gambian junta leader Captain Yahya Jameh has announced that 
presidential and general elections will be held next June to restore 
normal constitutional democracy in this West African country.
   In his New Year's message broadcast on the night of December 31, 
Jameh said that the voting will be preceded by local council polls in 
May and that the Commonwealth would back Gambia in the electoral 
process.
   The three elections will be supervised by an independent commission 
recently set up by the military regime, which plans to return to 
barracks after 23 months in power, Jameh said.
   The military ousted civilian president Sr. Dawda Jawara in a coup in 
July 1994, prompting international donors, led by former colonial power 
Britain, to condemn the coup and suspend financial assistance.
   Jameh presented an optimistic account of the achievements of his 
regime, speaking of progress in education, transport, energy production 
and television.
   He said that tourists were flocking back after the "disaster of 
1994". This year, Gambia expects to host some 70,000 tourists, as in 
1992 and 1993.
   The Head of State also declared that Nigerian and Cuban doctors would 
take over from Chinese medical workers, who withdrew their cooperation 
after Gambia recognised Taiwan in July last year. Beijing considers 
Taiwan to be part of China.
   The presidential announcement came only three days after Captain Sana 
Babally, former vice-president of the tiny West African state of Gambia 
was jailed for nine years by a court martial here, after being accused 
of having plotted against President Jameh.
   Sabally was said to have headed two attempted coups -- the first in 
November 1994 and the second in January 1995.
   Jameh, who is chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling 
Council, seized power in a bloodless coup on July 22, 1994 after 
toppling Dawda Jawara, who is in exile in Britain.
   Sabally, the vice-chairman of the Council, was accused of having 
participated in the January 1995 plot involving a Captain Sadibu Hydara, 
former Interior Minister who has since died in prison.
   Meanwhile, the military government is claiming more than US dollars 
11 million from Jawara for alleged fraud in an oil deal.
   In a statement published here on January 3, Jameh's government said 
it accepted the findings of a commission of inquiry into the deal set up 
in October 1994 under a Nigerian judge.
   The inquiry dealt with financial transactions linked to the supply of 
17.3 million barrels of oil supplied by Nigeria as aid to Gambia between 
1984 and 1988.
   Jawara, former Planning Minister Momodou Manneh, and a businessman of 
Lebanese origin, Jamil Said Mohamed, are accused of conspiring to resell 
the oil and pocket the proceeds.
   The oil should have brought in US dollars 42 million to Gambia's 
treasury, but only 2.6 million was actually paid in, a reliable source 
said.
   The statement said the government was demanding that Saidi Mohamed, a 
Sierra Leonean national, pay more than US dollars48 million to Nigerian 
national oil company.
   Former Sierra Leonean vice-president Abdulai Conteh, who was said to 
have facilitated the deal, was arrested last October and expelled from 
Gambia, where he had lived for several years.

Kenya
President Bans Scout Family Life Manual

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)

   Nairobi - President Daniel arap Moi has banned a family life 
education manual compiled by the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in Africa.
   Announcing the ban on "Scouting Manual on Family Life Education in 
Africa", President Moi said on New Year's eve that the book contained 
foreign ideas and emphasised that not all things that have come to 
Africa are necessarily good for the continent.
   Moi directed that the sales of the manual compiled as a collaborative 
effort with the Margaret Sanger Centre of Planned Parenthood in New 
York, USA, be stopped immediately.
   The move is seen as placatory to the the Catholic Church in Kenya 
which particularly over the last two years, has campaigned consistently 
against the intended introduction in schools of secular sex/family 
education lessons which the Church claims would disrupt the moral fabric 
of the nation.
   The Scouting Manual on "Family Life Education for Africa" has been 
available in Kenya over the last eight years, but it came into 
prominence last August when the head of the Catholic Church in Kenya, 
Maurice Cardinal Otunga, who is also the Archbishop of Nairobi, and the 
Imam of Jamia Mosque in Nairobi, Sheikh Ali Shee, jointly set alight a 
pile of sex education books, condoms and other birth control- related 
items in a public ceremony in the city's Uhuru Park.
   But the African regional director of the Scouts movement Mr. 
Kieraithe Nyagah told APS he was apprehensive the negative publicity 
associated with the manual would cast the Scout/Girl Guide Movement in 
bad light.
   Mr. Nyagah underscored that the manual had been produced "with all 
the best intention in the world."
   "As scouts we have a duty to ensure that young people have a chance 
and access to materials that enable them to develop into wholesome 
citizens," he said.
   Some critics have charged that some of the illustrations in the 
manual were too explicit and indecent. Nyagah says these were intended 
to show the changes in a young person's body.
   While conceding that input came from all over the world, he 
emphasised that the bulk of the manual had been produced with local 
African expertise.
   Nyagah observed that no other country in Africa including the 
regional ocean nations, had banned the book.
   He observed, however, that like any other textbook that had been in 
use for sometime the manual was subject to review from time to time. 
"Where it has hurt the sensitivities of any community or religious 
affiliations, we are prepared to modify it accordingly," emphasised the 
Africa regional boss of the Scout's movement.
   Meanwhile, the presidential directive to ban the manual has received 
widespread support among Catholic clergy and bishops. Praising President 
Moi for his decision, Cardinal Otunga promised that the Catholic Church 
in Kenya would re-dedicate itself to strengthening the family fabric.

Finances Threaten Africa's Environmental Programmes

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Kafui Ameh

   Nairobi - African countries have been urged to intensify efforts 
aimed at achieving sustainable development through adoption and 
implementation of sound environmental policies. But as it came out 
clearly at the Sixth Session of the African Ministerial Conference on 
the Environment (AMCEN) in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, last December, 
financial constraints are the root cause of the continent's 
environmental dilemma. 
   Although the programme of action on the environment which gave birth 
to the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) was 
launched in Cairo, Egypt in December 1985, no deliberate programme was 
set up to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the continental 
organisation in 1995.
   At the Sixth Session of AMCEN held in the Kenyan capital from 
December 11 to 15, 1995, proceedings were dominated by discussions about 
the survival of the organisation and the source of resources to run it 
rather than achievements made in the last one decade.
   The tone was set at the opening of the Expert Group Meeting which 
preceded the ministerial meeting when the representative and Director of 
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Africa Regional Office 
Mrs. Maria da Graca de Amorim called on African countries to focus 
properly on the situation confronting the continent.
   Mrs Amorim conceded that the African Ministerial Conference on the 
Environment had scored a number of inspiring successes such as the 
development and adoption of the African Common Perspectives on 
Biological Diversity and the significant inputs made by AMCEN to the 
process leading to the Regional Annex and resolution on urgent action 
for Africa with respect to desertification control.
   She however pointed out that the successful implementation of AMCEN 
programmes was being stifled by lack of financial resources and called 
for a discussion of modalities for fund mobilisation from member 
countries, bilateral and multilateral agencies.
   "There is an urgent need for AMCEN to streamline its programmes to be 
focussed more on sensitising African governments on sustainable 
development issues especially with regard to ratification and 
implementation of international conventions, and to back up these 
programmes with financial support," de Amorim said.
   She also called on the meeting to address the issue of formalising 
AMCEN by statutes as an intergovernmental body whose decision can be 
tabled at summit meetings of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and 
the establishment of appropriate institutional arrangements and linkages 
to make the conference secretariat more effective. Currently there is an 
amorphous secretariat comprising the UNEP, OAU and Economic Commission 
for Africa (ECA) personnel.
   "Do we want AMCEN to function independently or to remain an 
organisation that is permanently asking for charity?" That question 
posed later by the Senegalese Minister for Environment and Conservation 
of Natural Resources, Prof. Abdoulaye Battily reflected the mood of the 
ministerial meeting as participants considered the report of the group 
experts.
   Delegates expressed great concern about the unsatisfactory response 
by member countries to financial contributions towards trust fund agreed 
upon at the Fourth Session of AMCEN in 1991. Only Egypt and Seychelles 
had contributed US dollars 679,700 and 500 respectively towards the 
fund.
   The initial idea of the trust fund was that contributions would 
accrue over a five-year period (1992-96) after which interest yield 
would be used for the operational activities of AMCEN.
   After lengthy debate on whether to make contributions to the Trust 
Fund mandatory or voluntary, the African ministers decided that an 
urgent appeal be sent to member states to contribute to the fund while 
examining the possibility of adopting new measures of raising additional 
resources in order to facilitate the implementation of AMCEN programmes.
   The meeting also noted with concern the declining funding to the UNEP 
Environment Fund and urged all member states to honour their pledges to 
the fund.
   Perhaps the most significant decision was one to formalise the 
institutionalization of AMCEN as an intergovernmental organisation, 
providing the legislative framework including a constitution and related 
rules and regulations which will certainly cover financial 
contributions.
   The meeting also decided to continue with the 1994-95 programme of 
work into the biennium 1996-97 with some additional priorities. These 
would include sustainable industrial production, consumption and 
industrial development including aspects relating to the framework 
convention on change, environmentally sound management of all types of 
wastes including hazardous and potentially hazardous and toxic 
chemicals; as well as strengthening the African common perspective and 
position on the Convention of Biological Diversity through sensitization 
and awareness creation.
   Other priority areas identified included the rational management of 
African forests through the establishment of mechanisms for sub- 
regional cooperation and support to the implementation of the Convention 
to Combat Desertification and Drought.
   On the implications of major international events, the meeting agreed 
that AMCEN should fully participate in activities relating to 
environmental impacts within the framework of the UN agenda for peace 
and development and related programmes of action.
   The major international events highlighted by the Group of Experts 
meeting included the World UN Summit for Social Development held in 
Copenhagen last year, the 1995 World Summit for Women held in Beijing, 
China and the World Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II) 
scheduled for Istanbul, Turkey in June 1996.
   The AMCEN meeting also agreed that full support should be given to 
the assessment of environmental impacts of conflict and the resultant 
suffering by refugees and displaced persons as well as host nations.
   The session outlined five main areas of orientation that would form 
the focus of activities in the next two years. These comprise the 
sensitization and organisation of workshops, seminars and conventions 
within the available financial resources; support for the drawing up of 
national environmental plans of action and national Agenda 21 plans; the 
integration of the environmental impact assessment in development 
projects; capacity building, environmental education and public 
awareness; and the strengthening of sub-regional cooperation in 
environmental management.
   As the UN Under-Secretary General and Executive Director of UNEP, 
Miss Elizabeth Dowdeswell said during the opening of the ministerial 
meeting, AMCEN has a major role to play in reversing the continent's 
decline by judiciously using its vast resources, traditional solidarity 
and cooperation and international support.
   "The time has come for African countries to take their future into 
their own hands and not to allow their economies to be micro-managed by 
the international donor community. It is also incumbent on the donor 
community to listen more to Africa and seek partnerships as between 
equals, she said.
   While commending AMCEN for its contribution towards Africa's gradual 
transition to sustainable development in collaboration with the OAU and 
the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and other relevant regional 
and sub-regional institutions, Dowdeswell urged the Environment 
Ministers to press their governments to fulfil their financial 
obligations to the AMCEN Trust Fund to enable the organisation implement 
its laudable programmes.
   In his intervention, Prof. Battily had decried the presentation of 
lengthy speeches and rhetoric which did not address the real issues. 
"Where do African countries expect to get Samaritans to cover the 
financial aspect of the fight against environmental degradation?" he 
asked.
   Among the speakers who came up with some novel ideas was Samuel 
Nyambi, the Director of the New York-based UN office to combat 
desertification. Nyambi, a Cameroonian, suggested that AMCEN be renamed 
the African Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development 
(AMCED) to catch up with the spirit of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de 
Janeiro.
   Others also proposed that the conference be named the African 
Ministerial Conference on Sustainable Development (AMCOSD). Still, 
Nyambi argued that whatever name is finally retained, there was need for 
greater participation in the 1997 evaluation of the implementation of 
the Rio Conference Agenda 21 on sustainable development. "We need to 
prepare adequately for that session as we did before the 1992 Earth 
Summit because the issues are so crucial to Africa," he noted.
   In spite of the last minute shift of venue from Harare, Zimbabwe, to 
the Kenyan capital, the 20-plus Environment Ministers, more than 100 
government representatives and experts from 45 African countries, as 
well as about 25 international organisations who attended the Sixth 
Session of AMCEN, had enough food for thought.
   "We believe there should be greater inter-African consultation to 
ensure that we in Africa understand ourselves better and speak with a 
common voice at global fora on the environment," noted Dr. Farouk 
Brimah, Ghana's Deputy Minister for Environment, Science and Technology.
   Organisations represented included among others, the Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU), International Labour Organisation (ILO) the World 
Bank, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern 
African Development Corporation (SADC), and the UN Food and Agricultural 
Organisation (FAO).
   The Seventh Session of AMCEN will take place in Senegal in January 
1997.

Black And Beautiful But Skin Bleaching Persists

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Sam Gonza

   Nairobi - From time immemorial the enhancement of beauty has been a 
major preoccupation of the womenfolk. Not surprisingly, the beauty 
industry is among the ten largest industries in the world today. 
Unfortunately many products used in the pursuit of mostly "better" 
physical appearance have serious medical repercussions. This is true of 
skin bleaching creams, lotions, and soaps. In the Gambia, military ruler 
Captain Yahya Jameh has clamped down on skin lightening preparations, 
citing the medical dangers posed to the women in this West African 
country.
   On New Year's Eve, Gambian military ruler Captain Yahya Jameh decreed 
a complete ban on skin bleaching creams, lotions and soaps used as 
cosmetics by women in the Gambia. Captain Jameh said he had instituted 
the measure "for the good of the Gambian woman".
   But observers say the practice of bleaching the skin to obtain a 
lighter complexion is so widespread in Africa, banned items will simply 
be smuggled into the country. This is what has been happening in Nigeria 
for over 10 years now since skin bleaching products were officially 
banned in the mid-eighties.
   In spite of the documentation of the dangers over the last 20 years, 
millions of women continue to bleach their skins to obtain a lighter 
skin. The best approach to the problem would thus include education, an 
option already adopted by the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria 
(Lagos Zone).
   Among the main reasons cited by African women for lightening the 
skin, thus bleaching out the natural dark pigmentation that provides 
protection against the harsh rays of the sun - range from "men like fair 
complexioned women", "it is fashionable" to "purify the skin".
   Over the last ten years, the Medical Women's Association of Nigeria 
has intensified its campaign efforts to make Nigerian women understand 
that the process of lightening the skin is very hazardous indeed. The 
association has produced a pamphlet, Bleaching the Skin - What Every 
Woman Should Know, in which Dr. Osinuppebi-Cole observes that 
paradoxically while black people were bleaching their skin to look more 
beautiful, whites were seeking to acquire a turn by exposing themselves 
foolishly to the sun. "So while the blacks are seeking to become white, 
the whites are seeking to become dark, both exchanging good skin for 
cancerous skins", she says.
   In the 70s, skin bleaching creams containing as much as 7 per cent 
hydroquinone level - one of the main bleaching agents, were freely 
available in Africa. At the same time in America and Europe, creams 
containing one to two per cent level of hydroquinone were banned.
   Dr. Osinupebi-Cole laments that there was keen competition among 
manufacturers of skin bleaching agents and women demanded ever stronger 
chemicals. "The most serious damage to our women was done during this 
period," she argues.
   Today these soaps, creams and lotions originate in Asia, Europe, 
America and within Africa itself. One Irish woman Member of Parliament 
describes the trade in skin bleaching chemicals as "a scandal".
   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the habit of bleaching the skin "started in 
racially morbid countries like the United States and apartheid era South 
Africa.
   Hydroquinone and mercury in soaps are the main bleaching agents. 
Because mercury is absorbed through the skin it eventually leads to the 
development of various complications, notably kidney related.
   Officially, mercury products were banned in Nigeria in the mid- 
eighties but the same continue to flow into the country under such names 
as "Drula bleaching wax", "Skinguard", "Tura", "Concorde", "Roberts", 
"Neko", "Sukkisa", "Bango", "Jeribu" and many more.
   Dr. Yetunde-Olumide says the hydroquinone compound not only causes 
damage to the superficial skin cells, but has serious effects on the 
underlying connective tissues beneath.
   "Hydroquinone causes an acid called "homogentisic" acid to be 
deposited in skin tissue, eventually damaging the elastic properties of 
the skin as well as the ability of the skin to recover from injuries 
like cuts or surgery.
   Accordingly, long-term bleachers have serious complications when they 
go for surgery or even when they have minor cuts. "Wounds from even 
minor cuts become very difficult to heal. For the surgeon, it is a 
nightmare trying to stitch back the skin of chronic bleachers", says 
Olumide.
   Moreover, by removing the natural pigmentation of the skin through 
bleaching, the African woman is also exposed more intensively to 
dangerous rays of the sun. She becomes more prone to cancer of the skin.
   Dr. Olumide says at present there is no known cure for damage 
inflicted by skin bleaching. Having damaged their skin, some desperate 
women ask for a skin graft and feel terribly dejected when told that 
grafted skin cannot "take" because the entire associated structure had 
been damaged irretrievably.

Clergy Offers Solace To Pregnant Teenagers

All Africa Press Service
January 12, 1996 (19960112)
by Dingaan Mpondah

   Nairobi - Shunned and blamed by their families for being persons of 
loose morals, pregnant unmarried women in Zimbabwe can now find solace 
in a church-based local centre that nurtures both mother and child and 
offers a stepping stone for a future with a purpose.
   Mwana Anokosha (local Shona language for "precious child") Home is 
the only centre of its kind in Zimbabwe and possibly Southern Africa. It 
offers temporary sanctuary to unmarried women, mostly teenagers with 
unwanted pregnancies who have been rejected by their boyfriends and 
families.
   Situated in Westwood, on the outskirts of the capital, Harare, "Mwana 
Anokosha" was set up in 1988 by the Shelter Trust, which is made up of a 
group of clergymen. It now has a full-time social worker who counsels 
and "rehabilitates" the destitute young women.
   When the women first come to the home, the social worker explained, 
most of them are so lonely, desperate and down-hearted that some have 
suicidal tendencies. A lot of time and effort is put into helping them 
overcome these feelings.
   In response to public criticism, many of the women wrote a joint 
letter to Harare's Herald newspaper last year and spoke frankly about 
their experiences. "We have been kept in an atmosphere of trust and 
confidence where we may await the birth of our children in peaceful 
surroundings. After the delivery of our babies, when we have grown to 
love them, we are able to be reunited with our families.
   "We are very upset to discover that some people feel we are young 
people of loose morals. This is not true, and can be confirmed by the 
people who know us. Most of us really believed in the proposals of love; 
we did not even think of using contraceptives ...," they wrote.
   The number of illegitimate or one-parent children in Zimbabwe is 
high. Despite the difficulty in obtaining official statistics on this 
sensitive issue, it is believed that roughly one in every four teenage 
pregnancies is illegitimate. Several young women have been convicted and 
imprisoned for baby dumping over the years.
   More than 1000 women have been offered temporary shelter at the Mwana 
Anokosha Home until such time that they were reunited with their 
families. However, besides offering refuge to these rejected pregnant 
women, Shelter Trust has now opened up a skills training centre called 
Mufandichimuka Training Centre in Harare, designed to offer a new lease 
of life to these women, most of whom could not support themselves and 
their babies when they left home.
   The co-ordinator of Shelter Trust, Sister Theresa Mangieri, said the 
centre has been named "Mufandichimuka" meaning the home of the 
resurrected.
   "When the girls come to us, they are always so desperate and without 
hope. But the moment they get skills they will then be able to live a 
new life. They are being resurrected hence the name Mufandichimuka," she 
said.
   The majority of the women who end up at Mwana Anokosha Home are those 
who dropped out of school before sitting for a public examination, 
either Grade Seven, Form One or 'O' Level and have no formal skills at 
all.
   Out of the more than 280 who visited Shelter Trust offices in 1995, 
56 per cent dropped out of school before sitting for a public exam while 
eight per cent were illiterate. Those who had work experience had either 
worked as domestics or vendors. Only seven per cent had either done 
dressmaking, knitting, till operating or First Aid. There was one 
university graduate.
   Sister Theresa told APS the number of under-age girls (13 to 17 
years) becoming pregnant was also on the increase. The majority of the 
abandoned women came from intact families, only 4 per cent came from 
single-parent families.
   "In practice, Shelter Trust has been approached by women, some of 
whom might have tried backstreet abortions and failed. With support and 
counsel, these women have developed a strong bonding with their children 
after delivery. Unjust social conditions and priorities of the parents 
and boyfriends encourage them to choose an option they are not 
comfortable with. The psychological damage of abortion for a woman 
cannot be measured. Women who have contemplated abortion, but have not 
acted, have a sense of well-being and joy after delivery," she said.
   The majority of the men inolved with these women were single did not 
want any responsibilities. Casual sex was reported to be on the increase 
as the use of contraceptives, according to the women, was almost non-
existent, despite concerted campaigns by the Zimbabwe National Family 
Planning Council.
   "In line with the needs of the marginalised single mothers we are 
going to start a day skills training. The centre is expected to be 
officially opened in January 1996 but a pilot project involving 100 
former clients was carried out from September 1995. We have sent out 500 
newsletters to former clients telling them about the centre and whether 
they will be interested and the response has been overwhelming. So far 
100 clients have said they would want to enrol.
   "Firstly we are going to offer a course in home economics, 
housekeeping, knitting, sewing and cooking - and later we will introduce 
practical courses. We are starting off with the areas that are necessary 
to them now. We will later introduce such courses as hair braiding so 
that they can earn some income," she explained.
   Apart from offering courses, the centre would, from time to time, 
invite public speakers on various topics including the Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and maintenance to educate the mothers.
   "In general, the women in our residential outreach programmes are in 
need of means of a livelihood after they give birth and are discharged. 
Their common cry is for employment. Our hope is that when the skills are 
acquired, the women will be able to earn a living either on their own or 
through employment," noted Sr. Theresa.
   Researchers indicate that male reluctance to accept responsibility 
for pregnancy, coupled with limited psychological and financial support 
from the family are all seen as the crucial determinants in baby- 
dumping, infanticide and child abandonment. And, according to the World 
Bank, the chances of women dying from pregnancy-related causes are 
highest in Africa among all developing regions of the world.
   This is largely due to the high population growth rate - now the 
world's highest at around 3.2 per cent a year - which is taking a severe 
toll on the health of the mothers.
   As a result, some 150,000 maternal deaths are recorded each year in 
Africa as a whole, a figure representing 30 per cent of all maternal 
deaths world-wide.

Mother Of All Jazz Festivals 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Itumeleng oa Mahabane 
 
   Johanneburg - Not quite Montreux in July or April in Paris, Cape Town 
in February nonetheless promises a feast for lovers of jazz. Next month, 
Cape Town will play host to the largest jazz festival ever held in South 
Africa. 
   The line-up includes some impressive artists: trumpeter Maynard 
Ferguson, Brazilian-born vocalist Tania Maria, guitarist Earl Klugh, and 
Don Grusin. The festival also brings back to South Africa singer Randy 
Crawford, while lovers of the big-band sound will be given the 
opportunity to hear the most famous of the biggies -- the Count Basie 
Orchestra. 
   After last year's debacle, when two Americans promoting a jazz 
festival in the mother city did a duck shortly before it was due to 
open, South Africans might well feel cynical. The prevailing air of 
scepticism has also meant that little has been written about the 
upcoming festival. But organisers Esther Miller and Gerry Spencer (who, 
it should be pointed out, had nothing to do with the earlier ill-fated 
event) have been working towards this for three years and insist that no 
one will be taken for a ride. 
   The two, both local jazz musicians, say intensive planning has gone 
into the festival, and that their approach differs significantly from 
that of last year's organisers. Firstly, Miller and Spencer say, no 
names were announced until artists' attendance had been confirmed. 
Secondly, sponsors were secured well in advance. The financial and 
logistical support of a major airline and financial institution has been 
secured, with American Express in charge of bookings and accommodation, 
and KLM acting as official carrier for the festival. 
   Spencer and Miller hope the festival will bring in hard foreign 
currency in the form of tourism. The sponsors are putting together 
special tour packages, while Captour has promoted the event in overseas 
exhibitions. Apart from a lot of inquiries, there are no firm bookings 
by foreign tourists as yet. 
   Certainly, the festival will give Cape jazz a much-needed shot in the 
arm (a dose is also needed by Johannesburg) The festival will make use 
of a range of large venues, including the Good Hope Centre, the Nico 
complex, and the Waterfront Amphitheatre and Theatre; throughout the 
week, smaller gigs will also take place at various jazz clubs. 
   Jazz students will benefit from workshops and clinics -- two a day, 
throughout the week - -- some of which will be conducted by Klugh, who 
is a musical educator. The creation of a scholarship for young South 
African musicians to study overseas is also in the offing. There will be 
collaborations between local artists and visitors, and Miller herself 
will perform with the Jack Van Poll Trio. 
   Miller and Spencer say they tried to cater for classical as well as 
mainstream jazz-lovers by inviting Wynton Marsalis to play with the Cape 
Town Symphony Orchestra (CTSO). Unsuccessful negotiations over a fee and 
bad timing for the CTSO put paid to that. But South Africans may yet 
hear the flawless if sometimes passionless trumpet of Marsalis -- the 
organisers say they will try to bring him out either next year or the 
year after. 
   Hopefully the festival will be a success, because Capetonians can 
look forward to this becoming an annual event. Miller and Spencer have 
secured the sponsors' support for the next five years, and are 
negotiating to have the festival concerts televised. 
   The Cape Town jazz festival runs from February 26 to March 3.

Of Patrons And Peers 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Carol Brown 
 
   Johannesburg - Gerard Bhengu, forgotten KwaZulu-Natal artist, is now 
the subject of a retrospective. 
   One of my childhood memories is of attending an art exhibition at the 
Payne Bros store in Durban. The exhibitor was Tretchikoff -- the 
controversial, popular and very rich artist who held his road shows at 
the elegant art- deco store which housed a gallery. It was interesting, 
therefore, to learn that Gerard Bhengu was also one of the store's 
proteges. When one of Bhengu's other patrons, Phyllis Savory, considered 
producing a book on the artist's work, she stated that she wished it to 
be "on the same lines as the Tretchikoff book that Mr Timmins produced a 
few years earlier". The book on Bhengu did appear, but, unlike his 
contemporary, Bhengu became neither a household name nor a millionaire. 
   While comparisons between the two artists are spurious, it is worth 
noting that both were popular and promoted by the same gallery, which 
operated with a commercial bias. However, the art market during the 
Fifties and Sixties was not geared towards the payment of high prices 
for works by black artists. Bhengu's first patron, Dr Max Kohler, 
encouraged him to sign his name as "Bhenger" in the hope that its 
Germanic sound would be more acceptable to a white art-buying public. 
   The retrospective exhibition at the Tatham Gallery has been curated 
to bring these facts to the fore. Works are classified in sections to 
highlight patronage rather than style or subject matter -- an approach 
raising questions of influence, personal agendas and economic pressures. 
This curatorial method, while relatively unusual in a South African 
context, demonstrates a serious art-historical approach to the subject. 
   Bhengu was born in 1910 in the mission settlement of Centecow, 
attached to the Marianhill mission, in southern Natal. It was here that 
he encountered Kohler, who was an amateur ethnologist and commissioned 
Bhengu to produce illustrations for his ethnological texts. The 
discipline and accuracy necessary for this type of illustration suited 
Bhengu's talents and he produced detailed and meticulous images. These 
were contentious among his peers: attitudes towards ethnicity, 
nationhood and tribal identity were highly controversial, particularly 
following the Native Administration Bill of 1927, which made tribal 
chiefs the leaders of all black South Africans, and exerted control 
leading to the bantustans and apartheid. 
   But it was through his portrayal of ethnic types that Bhengu's art 
achieved its popularity, especially among the tourists who frequented 
the Payne Bros gallery. Seeing a number of his sepia portraits together 
makes it obvious that he perfected a slick technique which allowed mass 
production, although this doesn't detract from his ability as a 
draughtsman. 
   As well as portraiture he depicted the rural countryside of his 
youth, but his view differed from the early white artists such as Thomas 
Baines, Jacob Hendrik Pierneef and Clement Senque, who showed the land 
as majestically devoid of humanity and waiting for the white settler. 
Bhengu's landscapes were peopled, showing the black person inhabiting 
and working the land. As discussed in the catalogue by Leeb du Toit and 
Zaver Dinos, these images could be seen to express ideas of rightful 
ownership and perpetuation. 
   According to contemporary accounts, his freest and most creative work 
was that which no longer exists except through photographs, sketches and 
verbal descriptions. These were murals commissioned by the herbalist EG 
Tembe in 1959, and a mural for the Wesleyan Methodist Institute in 
Durban in 1942. They were both created for black audiences and the 
latter was said to be the earliest example of black protest art in South 
Africa. Both these murals have been destroyed, but written accounts seem 
to confirm that the fact of a different audience affected his work 
strongly. 
   Bhengu died, poverty stricken and unheralded, at the age of 80. This 
exhibition highlights his talent and the manner in which economic and 
educational pressures of his time influenced his art. It forms an 
important addition to South African art history, but unfortunately will 
only be viewed in KwaZulu- Natal. It deserves a wider audience. 
   The retrospective runs at the Tatham Gallery in Pietermaritzburg 
until January 7, and at Durban Art Gallery from January 28 to February 
26.

Business and Finance
Not Nailed By Success 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Vuyo Mvoko  
 
   Johannesburg - A levelling of the playing fields is necessary for 
black businesses to succeed, argues Dr Nthato Motlana.
   Chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail), Dr Nthato Motlana 
is not out of the running for industrial finance company Johnnic. He 
told the Mail & Guardian recently that he is planning to raise R6-
billion for a stake in Johnnic, one of the three companies into which 
mining house Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) has been 
unbundled. 
   Johnnic controls Times Media Limited and the South African Breweries 
among others. Motlana says R3-billion of the capital will come from Nail 
and its subsidiaries, one of which, Metropolitan -- which controls 
Methold -- has over R8-billion in net assets. 
   Motlana does not hide his political leanings which, over the past 
couple of weeks, saw him being accused of meddling with the editorial 
freedom of The Sowetan newspaper. 
   It was alleged that Motlana had been under pressure from the African 
National Congress to force Sowetan staff to "toe the ANC line". 
   While he admits to having been approached by President Nelson Mandela 
who raised problems with some of the Sowetan's articles, the man who 
says he was once seen as "the Trojan horse who acquired the paper on 
behalf of the ANC", denies any interference. 
   How do his ventures benefit the black community? Irate, he replies: 
"Whenever anybody goes into business, he goes for himself. Anyone who 
pretends to the contrary is a liar or a fool. Write that down, and go 
and tell them!" 
   He pauses, then bursts into laughter, apparently regretful at his 
cantankerous outburst. Then slowly, he continues: "Anyone who does not 
sleep, preparing and going from meeting to meeting, is doing it for 
himself. What happens to other people is as a result of your own 
personal empowerment." 
   Indeed, Motlana opposed a move by Anglo American to transfer 20 
percent of The Sowetan shares to a black community trust with 
beneficiaries such as the Educational Opportunities Council, the Get 
Ahead Foundation and a host of homes for the mentally handicapped, 
arguing that black "entrepreneurs", like their white counterparts, 
should have the opportunity of real ownership. 
   Motlana denies purchasing the impoverished weekly New Nation, now a 
sister publication of the Sowetan, because of ANC pressure. 
   The losing gamble was owing to the role the paper played in the 
transformation of the country, he says, but if it does not recover in 
the next six months, "we'll forget it". 
   'You know," he says with a smile, "I've paid my dues to my community 
and my country. I cannot understand why they don't pick on (Real Africa 
Group chairman) Don Ncube, Thebe Investments, or the Kunene Brothers. Is 
it obscene to make money? 
   "There are others who make money but they don't go ask them what they 
do for the community, they do that only to Motlana. They must go to 
hell, man! 
   "I'm sick and tired of Sam Shilowa and Zwelinzima Vavi. Sick! Sick! 
Sick! When they get stuck in the middle of a speech they insert Motlana, 
whoaaa! Whether they do not have the intelligence to think further than 
Motlana, I can't understand." 
   Motlana had been foretold, he claims, by people like international 
businessman Tony O'Reilly, that he would be hated for his business 
acumen. 
   "Sometimes I get mad when people think I started being involved in 
business because the ANC was unbanned and Nelson Mandela got out of 
prison." 
   "My first company was called Phaphama Afrika Commercial Enterprises, 
formed in the 60s, when it was almost impossible to do so. You had to 
kick shins and push hard, there were no loans for black people and no 
premises in town. 
   "I'm chairman of Lesedi Clinic, the first black-owned private clinic 
in this country. I'm the founder chairman of the 80 000-member Sizwe 
Medical Aid Fund. We built the Takalani home for the mentally 
handicapped in Soweto. 
   "When people ask me, how do you benefit your community? I say look 
back at my record: I've been involved in politics since age 18; detained 
as secretary of the ANC Youth League; on the dock with Mandela in the 
'Sisulu and 19 others' trial of 1952; once was chairman of 18 community 
organisations; formed the Get Ahead Foundation; went around the world 
and collected money to create a fund that helped people like Sakkie 
Macozoma get a Masters degree in Communication." 
   "Even before Black Like Me, we started Africare, the first black hair 
products manufacturing company. We did not succeed because banks would 
not give us money, our guys did not have MBAs, and we had no marketing." 
   Nail's hopes to raise the capital needed to purchase a stake at 
Johnnic were once dashed by capital constraints, he says. "I hope people 
will not say the Motlana group is being favoured. We have that critical 
mass. 
   If we don't do it, somebody else will". 
   Motlana says Nail was interested in buying a portion of Telkom, but 
was barred by Telkom's insistence that foreign companies must come, not 
in partnerships with local black companies in the name of black economic 
empowerment, but on their own. 
   He laments this, arguing no black company can provide "international 
connectivity, foreign capital, better management and new technology." 
   With regard to the pyramid control of businesses in the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange, he says it "has been the standard structure in South 
Africa. Look at Murray and Roberts, Sancorp, Sanlam, Anglo American. 
Then when a young black company like Nail goes to the stock exchange, 
they say No." 
   Talk of flattening the pyramids, he says, is not fair to the emerging 
black business, "there should first be a levelling of playing fields." 
   On Nail's plans for 1996: "We want to consolidate. We'd like to focus 
on telecommunications, obtain a TV licence, increase our stake in 
newspapers, and I won't tell you the rest." 
   "What people should be asking is, how did you get where you are. We 
can share ideas, form groups together and move forward."

South Africa 
Cricket: Breathing New Life Into An Old Game 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Jon Swift  
 
   Johannesburg - Paul Adams has brought unbridled enthusiasm and joy to 
a team which already has grit and courage 
   It is well as we move into a new year to savour some of the tragedies 
and failures of the 12 months just past. For the cricketers contesting 
the current series, the breaking of a savage countrywide drought has 
been an unwanted hindrance. For the squatters of Maritzburg it has meant 
total devastation and, in well over 100 cases, loss of life. 
   But on both admittedly widely different counts, one cannot but 
rejoice in the resilience of the human condition. The surviving 
squatters are hastily rebuilding their shattered lives and a nation 
mourns for them as they fight their way out of the morass of a 
catastrophic natural disaster. 
   And surely, no South African -- no matter how insensitive -- can see 
the lack of playing days the heavens have allowed against the touring 
English under Mike Atherton against any other backdrop. 
   Yes, the cricket is important and as lifegiving in its own way as the 
waters which have, in their overabundance after almost a decade of arid 
refusal, abruptly taken the lives of so many. 
   And yes, it is important to all of us in this emergent admix of 
peoples and tongues, cultures and conditioning, that the nation have 
success to show in the face of such adversities. 
   For as the flood-ravaged communities on the banks of the Umsunduzi 
tackle their devastated lives anew, cricket has been given a like chance 
to present a renewal of spirit to graft onto the courage and fortitude 
which has marked the ethos of this country's teams since our 
readmittance in 1992. 
   It has not been an easy series to quantify and certainly not an easy 
one for the players of both sides to contest. The disappointment of the 
rained-out first and third tests at Centurion Park and Kingsmead have 
been one factor. 
   The refusal of Atherton and his English batesman to bow to the raw 
pace of the South Africans has been another. Certainly, Atherton's 
unbeaten 185-run, 10-hour 44-minute stay at the crease to deny a result 
at the Wanderers in an innings of true cricketing integrity is not an 
individual effort which will be lightly discounted. 
   Neither can you lightly dismiss the maiden century by the gritty Gary 
Kirsten at the Wanderers or his two half-centuries which earned him the 
Man of the Match award in the drawn fourth Test at St George's Park last 
week. 
   But it was in the disappointment of Port Elizabeth with yet another 
Test without a result in a series which had rapidly been running out of 
steam that the essence of rebirth came to light. And fitting that St 
George's Park, the venue for the first international this country ever 
played when they took the field against CA Smith's English invaders back 
in 1889, should have provided it. 
   For two things made this meeting between South Africa and England 
different from any international played before. The first was a chubby-
faced youngster from the humble environs of Grassy Park on the Cape 
Flats with the strangled action of a capsized terrapin. 
   The second was a muscular politician with thick spectacles, a voice 
like broken glass and a former postal address on an isolated island not 
far off the coast from the mountain which looms large over Newlands 
where the two teams are currently engaged in the series decider. 
   Paul Adams became the youngest player to wear cricket's green and 
gold at 18 years and 340 days. It was only his sixth first-class match, 
an honour he rightly earned and, many would argue, two tests overdue. 
   Coach Bob Woolmer summed it up in one succinct phrase: "He looked 
like he's played Test cricket for 15 years," he said. Indeed. 
   Adams took a modest four wickets on a flat and unresponsive pitch in 
his debut, but in this performance, there was the roots of a renaissance 
in the game. Adams plays the game with the unbridled enthusiasm and 
inner joy which its originators in the Vale of Hambledon surely intended 
for the world's most glorious game. 
   In this alone, Adams has something to give back to the team which the 
exposure to the professional pragmatism of the English and the cynical 
sledging of the Aussies have taken from it. 
   It would be both premature and unpardonable to heap all the 
responsibility for ensuring this new spirit follows through on his young 
shoulders, but the sight of captain Hansie Cronje's smile when Adams 
dismissed Graham Thorpe to register what we must believe will be the 
first of many Test victims was evidence enough that the young man has a 
special magic about him. 
   And, just for a moment review the new life Adams injected into the St 
George's Park brass ensemble. The music even had Jonty Rhodes turning 
Mapantsula in the field. If this is the new voice of South African 
cricket, long may that voice roar. 
   Which brings us to the second man in the equation, Minister of Sport 
Steve Tshwete. Tshwete has never been shy of tacking his flag to the 
mast. He cried openly at South Africa's early cricketing successes and, 
though an avowed rugby man, has been one of the great advocates of the 
game under the new dispensation. 
   Tshwete forsook the padded seats of the official enclave, shed his 
jacket and took to the stands to join the extended membership band, wave 
the flag and add his voice to the on-going celebration that was the very 
heart of this dull draw. 
   One shudders to think of the discord Tshwete's vocal cords engendered 
in his immediate surroundings. But in Tshwete doing what he did, there 
was the very embodiment of what Krish Mackerdhuj and Ali Bacher had 
claimed as administrators and Kepler Wessels, Cronje and the teams they 
have led have attempted so ardently and so well to put into practice as 
players. 
   It is well that Newlands -- incidentally the venue of this country's 
second Test against Smith's tourists before the turn of the century -- 
has become so vital in the equation of the current England tour. 
   No cricket lover would begrudge the fact that a ground which retains 
its beauty and majesty despite the ravages development has wrought, 
should be the place to settle matters once and for all. 
   It is home to Adams, Kirsten and Brian McMillan -- perhaps the only 
player alongside Donald who can claim true world class among the South 
Africans during this series -- although the young spin bowler can only 
claim a fleeting relationship. 
   The crux of the issue though is not that Kirsten and McMillan have 
got centuries. Or that Atherton and Graeme Hick -- a superb 141 at 
Centurion Park -- have managed their top scores in Test cricket. 
   Neither does it hinge on wicketkeeper Jack Russell's world record 11 
dismissals behind the stumps to some wayward South African batting and 
his stubborn refusal to leave the crease after Meyrick Pringle had given 
him an early life in the same match. Or even that Shaun Pollock is 
developing into both a frighteningly dangerous new ball exponent and a 
polished lower middle order bat. 
   It all really hangs on a contrast of attitude. 
   England have always seemed to be playing not to lose. 
   The naggingly negative line adopted by Dominic Cork -- far and away 
the best of the England bowlers on tour -- and Richard Illingworth in 
the second innings at St George's is as much evidence of this as the way 
the tourists have packed their batting line-up and consistently refused 
to employ the erratic power and pace of Devon Malcolm. 
   Cronje and his side have played to win. That they have not yet 
managed this is proof of Woolmer's contention that they are not a 
collection of individual stars, but rather a cohesive, tough and 
sometimes uncompromising collective. 
   In this, perhaps Cronje and his men embody on the sportsfield, the 
refusal to lie down in adversity which has been shown by the sad spectre 
of the squatters on the banks of the Duzi. 
   For these are as much the people our current crop -- Hansie Cronje, 
Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullian, Jonty Rhodes, Brian 
McMillan, Dave Richardson, Shaun Pollock, Craig Matthews, Allan Donald, 
Jacques Kallis, Nicky Boje and Paul Adams -- are playing for as the 100 
000-plus who bought tickets for Newlands before a ball was bowled. 
   And who all the future wearers of the national flag -- above whatever 
emblem the officials come up with next -- must strive to represent. 
   The advent of Adams has shown what is attainable. And that cricket in 
this country can truly be for all, politician or pleb. There is new life 
in the old game yet.

Africa-at-Large
Soccer: All The Nations For The Cup 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Lungile Madywabe  
 
   Johannesburg - A host of Africa's top stars will converge on South 
Africa next week for the African Nations Cup finals 
   When Kenya's sports minister Hussein Maalinm Mohamed said that his 
country was withdrawing from hosting the African Nations Cup, because of 
a lack of funds, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) did not 
hesitate to appoint South Africa in their place. 
   If South Africa succeeds in its handling of the tournament, it may 
well be the recipe for hosting the 2006 World Cup. Caf president Issa 
Hayatou has already given his full backing to South Africa's bid to host 
the world's biggest soccer bonanza. 
   But for now the 20th African Nations Cup showdown starts next 
Saturday at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg, with South Africa against 
Cameroon, the two-time winners of this tournament and 1990 World Cup 
quarter- finalists against England. Cameroon won the tournament in 1984 
and 1988. 
   South Africa will be hoping to increase to seven the number of 
countries to have won the tournament as hosts. 
   The Black Stars of Ghana, four-time winners, first won the 
championship in 1963 when it was held in Accra. They also hosted and won 
it in 1978. Together with Egypt they share the privilege of being the 
only countries that have defended the title. 
   The Black Stars will be looking to Leeds striker Tony Yeboah and 
captain Abedi Pele Ayew. They come to the tournament having last claimed 
it in 1982 when it was hosted by Libya. 
   Hoping to equal the winning ways of Ghana are the three-time winners 
the Pharoahs of Egypt who hosted the cup in 1959 and 1986, and made sure 
on both occasions that it stayed there. Egypt also won it on its 
inception in 1957 in Sudan. 
   Algeria won the cup in 1990, failed in Senegal in 1992, before a 
total nightmare in Tunisia 94 when they were banned for using an 
ineligible player. 
   Two other teams from Southern Africa have made it to the finals 
despite the politcal upheavals that have been taking place in their 
countries. Angola deserve all the support they can get from their fans. 
In the words of South African coach Clive Barker they "must surely be 
ranked the darkest horses of the tournament". 
   Mozambique will give a few of their opponents a run for their money, 
taking into account their recent performance against South Africa who 
beat them 3-2 after the visitors had taken the lead twice. 
   South Africa is once again surrounded by controversy with the 
chairman of the technical committee of the South African Football 
Association, Jomo Sono, who also serves as an adviser to Barker, not 
being informed of the final selection of the squad. The surprise 
exclusion of Brendon Augustine of Umtata Bucks was also a surprise to 
many. The insistence on including Lucas Radebe of Leeds United despite 
doubts about his fitness has also raised eyebrows. The Leeds coach has 
reservations about Radebe's ability to keep pace with the demands of the 
tournament. 
   Tunisia, who have been hosts twice and have never won the cup, will 
be hoping to put all the traumas of 1994 behind them. They are in the 
same group as Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, both of whom are favourites to 
finish first and second in the group forcing Tunisia to pack their bags 
early. 
   Gabon was the first team to pack their bags in Tunisia and the gods 
must surely have turned their backs on them. They are in the same group 
as the reigning champions Nigeria.. 
   Protests over the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other activists in 
Nigeria have made their team's participation in the tournament doubtful. 
Nigeria is to make a decision on Friday whether they are coming or not 
and, if they decline, then Guinea will be the replacements 
   Most of the Ivory Coast players come from the Asec Mimosa club and 
one wonders how their coach Pierre Pleimelding will be able to mentally 
refocus some of the players whose guts and determination were tested to 
the full when they recently lost to Orlando Pirates in the Champions 
Cup. 
   The stars of the tournament may well be Liberia, inspired by the 
European and African footballer of the year George Weah. They nearly 
withdrew from the tournament because of finance, and Weah had to dig dip 
into his pocket to make sure that Liberia make the best of their first 
appearance at the finals. 
   After many of the team members had been killed in a plane crash in 
Gabon in 1993, Zambia nearly won the cup in Tunisia when they were 
beaten 2-1 by Nigeria in the finals. Having come so close to winning the 
cup in 1994, this may well be their chance to lift it. 
   Burkina Faso come to the finals as the only team with an unbeaten 
record in the qualifying matches and are the first team from Africa to 
have qualified for the World Cup in 1974 in Germany. They have eight 
foreign-based players in their team. They will be counting on Seydou 
Traore who plays for FC Bressuirein in France and Abdoulaye Kassoum 
Ouerdraogo who is based in Germany with FSV Franfurt.   
   Zaire has won the cup twice, in 1968 and 1974. They were booted out 
in the quarter- final stage by eventual winners Nigeria in 1994. In the 
qualifying stages they beat Morocco at home, before going on to draw 
with Ivory Coast. Among some of their foreign-based players are Ngole 
Kona of Genderbirligi in Turkey and Mbote Ndinga of Vitoria Guimaraes.  
   Sierra Leone will be coming to the finals for the second time. They 
also nearly withdrew from the tournament for financial reasons. Kewullay 
Conteh of Atalanta in Italy and Lamine Conteh of SV Meppen in Germany 
will lead their team.

Africa-at-Large
Boxing: Take Me To Atlanta 

Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Julian Drew  
 
   Johannesburg - From humble beginnings in Venda, Ntsudzuluseni Ndou is 
heading for the Olympics in Atlanta. 
   In Venda Ntsudzuluseni means "take me to another place", and for 
Ntsudzuluseni Ndou boxing has done just that. The 18-year-old from 
Thoyandou is Atlanta-bound in July as a member of South Africa's Olympic 
team after winning the silver medal in the featherweight division at the 
All Africa Games in Harare last September. 
   Ndou is better known by his English name of Philip, which is easier 
on the tongue for most people. The tall matriculant is lean and mean and 
uses his long reach to stay out of trouble. He is confident about his 
prospects in Atlanta. "I think I will do well at the Olympics because I 
know there is nobody in Africa who is better than me," says Ndou. 
   A strange statement you might think for someone who was beaten to the 
gold medal at the All Africa Games, but for anyone who saw his final 
against Egypt's Saleh Abdelbary it is not surprising at all. To say he 
was cheated of victory is something of an understatement. "It was the 
worst decision I've seen in 45 years of amateur boxing," says national 
team manager Dan Bushney. 
   Ndou completely dominated the fight but when it came to adding the 
points from the scoring machines of the five judges it was clear that 
some of the North African judges were less than impartial in their 
observations. "It wasn't a hard fight for me. My hardest fight came in 
the semi-final against the Mauritian who was a very tough opponent. I 
found the final very easy in comparison but the judges robbed me. They 
said I was the loser but everyone else who saw the fight said I was the 
winner. The guys from Egypt and Tunisia just didn't want South Africa to 
win," says Ndou. 
   Such controversial decisions have long been part and parcel of 
amateur boxing. But internationally the situation has improved now with 
a wider spread of judges and fewer ideological divisions around the 
globe. 
   The new scoring system introduced at the Barcelona Olympics has also 
made it difficult to rig results. Now, for a scoring blow to count, 
three out of the five judges must hit the button on their scoring 
machines within one second. In Africa though there is a dominance of 
officials from North African countries and they are accused of helping 
each others' boxers at the expense of other countries. 
   According to Bushney, the only way to change this is to get more 
judges from the rest of Africa onto the African Boxing Confederation's 
panel which is an issue that South Africa intends addressing in the near 
future. 
   It was Ndou's victory over Josian Lebon of Mauritius in the semi-
final which impressed observers though. The short, stocky Mauritian was 
a strong and experienced fighter but Ndou fought intelligently to turn 
the tables on him. Ndou used body blows and moved quickly to tire him 
and kept him at arm's length so he couldn't land too many telling blows. 
"It was a difficult fight because we both knew each other's styles after 
sparring together at our training camp in Kroonstad before the All 
Africa Games. But Bodo (national team coach Bodo Andreass) had watched 
him closely in Kroonstad and he altered my style a little to confuse him 
and I just fought to my strengths," says Ndou. 
   Ndou only got into the national team last year after winning the 
South African title as a 16- year-old in 1993 and retaining it in 1994. 
He puts much of his recent improvement down to the arrival of Andreass 
at the end of 1994. Andreass is a former East German amateur boxer who 
spent four years coaching the Nigerian national team which won two 
silver medals at the Barcelona Olympics. 
   He came to South Africa at the request of the National Olympic 
Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) which seconded him to the South 
African National Amateur Boxing Organisation (Sanabo) under its 
Operation Excellence programme. "He is a very experienced coach and he 
knows a lot about boxing. He has really taught me a lot and that is why 
I did well in Harare. I think Nocsa should keep him on after Atlanta 
because our results have really started to improve under him," says 
Ndou. 
   The lessons he has learnt from Andreass are also starting to pay off 
at the Makwarela Boxing Club in Thoyandou where he coaches the other 
boxers in a makeshift club house in one of the classrooms at his school. 
"I have improved so much with Bodo and everything he has taught me I 
also teach my boxers here in Venda. I show them how to train properly 
and now we have two juniors and six seniors who are the best in Venda. 
This year they will go to the South African championships and I know 
they are going to do well," says Ndou. 
   For now though Ndou's eyes are focused far beyond the national 
championships and on the Olympic Games which are now just over six 
months away. "It is a great honour to fight for your country at the 
Olympics and it is important not to let your country down. I must go to 
Atlanta and work hard to show people what it means to be a South African 
champion and make people respect this country," says Ndou. 
   If Ntsudzuluseni Ndou can do anything like as well as he did in 
Harare in the much more demanding Olympic arena he won't have to worry 
about being taken to another place. He will be made for life and have 
his name etched indelibly in the annals of local sporting legend.

Africa-at-Large
[DOCUMENT] Luba Art Exhibit Opens

Museum for African Art (New York)
January 05, 1996 (19960105)

   New York - MEMORY: Luba Art and the Making of History is the first 
American exhibition to present the art and culture
of the Luba of Zaire and the first ever to explore how Luba works of art 
function in the reconstruction of memory and history.
   While Luba Sculpture is among the most beautiful of African arts, it 
also reveals astounding philosophical complexity.  The Luba, one of the 
most important kingdoms of central Africa (southeastern Zaire) from the 
17th through 19th centuries, highly value the recounting of royal 
history, and encode its complexity on an array of stunning art objects 
created precisely to stimulate and guide memory.
   MEMORY presents over 100 of these unique objects which enable the 
Luba to remember and re-interpret their collective past. Memory boards, 
beaded emblems, ornamented royal scepters and axes, thrones, divination 
instruments' wooden figures and body arts each have a particular visual, 
tactile and spatial vocabulary. It is this incised, symbolic coding 
system that helps the Luba remember the esoteric information, pivotal 
events, royal personages and political relationships that make up their 
collective history and individual identity.
   The Museum for African art is located at 593 Broadway (between 
Houston and Prince). General Admission is $4; $2 for children, students 
and senior citizens. Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday 10:30-5:30 
pm, Saturday and Sunday, 12-6 pm. For information call(212)966-1313

Sudan
Khartoum Attempts To Strengthen Its Defences At The War Front

Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)

   London - Reeling from the the speed of the recent Sudan People's 
Liberation Army (SPLA) offensive in the civil war, the National Islamic 
Front (NIF) regime in Khartoum has alternated between crying out for 
help from a limited number of friendly states and accusing all and 
sundry of aiding and abetting the SPLA in what the regime has described 
as a foreign invasion of Southern Sudan.
   The United States of America is at the top of the list of Sudan's 
enemies, closely followed by Israel, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda and 
Egypt. Claiming that the SPLA had neither the means nor the technical 
know-how to carry out such an offensive, Khartoum has constructed an 
incredible conspiracy theory involving all of the above named states.
   According to Khartoum, Eritrea supplied the SPLA with tanks and 
weapons which were transported from Massawa on the coast through 
Ethiopia and Uganda and into Southern Sudan. Egyptian Military transport 
planes were also used to carry weapons and equipment via Uganda. So far 
the regime's propaganda ministry has failed to produce any evidence to 
back up its bizarre theory. The regime claims to have captured tanks and 
other weapons with Eritrean and Ugandan markings on them, and also 
claims to have claims to have killed or captured Eritrean  and Ugandan 
officers and troops.  However, Khartooum refuses to produce this 
evidence for independent verification. This is not surprising because it 
is not beyond the regime's capacity to forge such evidence.  At some 
point the regime claimed that it had killed 263 Ugandan soldiers at Kit. 
The claim was easily ridiculed because a British Broadcasting 
Corporation (BBC) news team was at Kit with the (SPLA) forces and could 
testify to Khartoum's lies in a "Focus on Africa" programme the 
following day,
   In Khartoum itself, the regime has tried to whip up a hate campaign 
against the few US nationals still resident there. The US embassy has 
countered this by issuing its own mimeographed statements and widely 
distributing them across the Three Towns capital. The US has denied 
providing any support for the SPLA or having any involvement with the 
opponents of the regime. The US regards Khartoum's allegations as being 
counter-productive to the ongoing dialogue designed to improve US-regime 
relations
  The US has taken Khartoum's threats seriously enough to recall its 
ambassador from Sudan for consultation. It is believed that while the 
ambassador was in Washington, D.C., he suggested that a forthcoming 
visit to the US by SPLA leader Colonel John Garang be canceled. The 
ambassador argued that to receive Colonel Garang at a senior level would 
give credence to reports of clandestine US support for the SPLA and as 
such could enflame the problems in Khartoum. In the event, the SPLA 
leader arrived on schedule and was received at the same official level 
he is usually accorded. In spite of the ambassador's concerns, it would 
appear that the Clinton administration finally took the view that to 
cancel the visit would be tantamount to giving in to the regime's 
blackmail. That would be an inappropriate way to conduct UA foreign 
policy, considering the number of rogue regimes it has to deal with 
world-wide. Khartoum protested about the visit, but Washington ignored 
them.
   The government of Uganda responded quite sharply to Khartoum's 
allegations and threats. In November, it had merely mentioned that it 
took Khartoum's threats to invade Uganda seriously and was on the alert 
to repel any such invasion. Last month, however, the Ugandans took a 
much stronger line and on 6 December a presidential statement demanded 
that Khartoum cease its support and assistance for the Lords Resistance 
Army (LRA) or Ugandan commandos would be dispatched into Southern Sudan 
to deal with the Ugandan rebel group.
  "If Khartoum continues to send in these armed bandits to kill our 
farmers, women and children in Northern Uganda, and to plant anti-
personnel mines in the countryside, we will have no choice but to send 
in our commandos to pursue, search and destroy the LRA bandits inside 
Sudan.
   Unable to motivate or properly supply its ground forces in the South 
and the Nuba Mountains, the regime has begun to depend more heavily on 
aerial bombardment of civilian targets. The regime has increased the 
number of raids it makes each day. In late November and early December, 
reports claimed that the regime had begun to use chemical warfare in the 
Nuba Mountains. The chemicals are believed to have been supplied by the 
Iraqis who have used such weapons against their own internal opponents. 
The Iraqis have also provided planes and troops
   The former Soviet republic of Belarus has sold ten planes to 
Khartoum. They are long range bombers and cost $150,000,000. The deal 
was a purely economic one rather than an ideological marriage between 
the two countries. As the regime is known to be strapped for cash, this 
deal begs the question of where the money to buy the planes actually 
came from. It is believed that Iran and the oil rich state of Qatar 
split the bill between them. The planes have already been delivered and 
have begun bombing raids over the South.  Belarus also supplied 
technicians and pilots.
  Iran has recently supplied the regime with other military equipment 
and weapons. It is also the regime's main supplier of fuel for its 
military operations in the South.
   The Islamic states of Indonesia and Malaysia have also supplied 
military equipment to the regime, having been swayed by the NIF's pleas 
that its Islamic system is under threat from the infidels and is 
therefore worthy of support
   The injection of equipment and weapons has yet to have impact on the 
fortunes of the regime in the war. It is doubtful whether they will have 
any real impact because in order to utilize the regime needs to have 
trained personnel at the battlefront. The regimes forces are demoralized 
at present and those in outlying posts are suffering from a shortage of 
provisions. The regime's troops are ill fed, ill supplied, ill equipped 
and ill motivated whilst operating in the hostile environment of the 
South. The recent SPLA victories have only added to their problems and 
reduced the morale even further.
   In Juba two battalions of troops have disobeyed orders to move out 
into the countryside by spinning out their requisition of necessary 
supplies for future operations. These troops were visited in December by 
a succession of the regime's leaders in a bid to build up their morale. 
Dr. Hussan Abdulla El Turabi and Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, the foreign 
minister, both visited Juba. In addition, first vice president General 
Zubeir Mohammed Salih led a number of senior military figures on a visit 
to the troops,
   The regime's leaders are having to face up to the fact that troops on 
active duty in the South are less convinced by propaganda than the 
civilians in the North may be. These troops have experienced the reality 
of battle at first hand and know that the SPLA is a committed enemy 
fighting for a cause it believes in. They feel less enamored by their 
own cause and the brainwashing about angels and infidels they received 
before coming south.
   Khartoum's forces have very good reasons for feeling demoralized. A 
conventional army used to regular supplies and meals is now having to 
make do on subsistence rations. Whereas their enemy, the SPLA is used to 
such hard conditions, Khartoum's forces are not.  In many outlying 
military posts, the regimes troops are surviving on bread and hot onion 
sauce served once a day.
   The troops have also been immobilized by a fuel shortage and most of 
the transport vehicles are inactive. The troops have to carry out all 
their operations on foot. Ammunition is in short supply, replacement 
uniforms are non-existent and the conventional army now looks more like 
a poorly supplied guerrilla army than the SPLA does.
   Reports last month have spoken of large scale desertion by the 
regime's forces around Juba and they are trying to make their way back 
to Northern Sudan by whatever means available. In November, seventy 
soldiers returning to Juba from a defeat at Pageri boarded a steamer 
bound for the North rather than report to the Army HQ. The steamer was 
halted down river at Bor, eighty miles north of Juga, where the soldiers 
were arrested and detained. The regime fears that is demoralized troops 
return to the North and publicize the true situation in the war, then 
the public will clamor for peace and recruits for the army will be even 
harder to find that they are already.
   The regime has uncharacteristically issued a statement about the 
situation in both Kapoeta and Torit denying that there is any military 
confrontation with the SPLA around the two towns. The statement 
denounced the people who have been undermining the regime's war efforts. 
The denial was unsolicited and might shed further light on the situation 
if it is looked at in a more critical majjer. Why bother to deny 
something that has not been publicized by the enemy unless there is some 
truth in it? The SPLA has only reported on actual battle successes and 
has seen no need to make sweeping statements about the overall situation 
in the war. It is the regime which feels the need to do this and it is 
surely a sign of its own concern. 
   The battle fronts around Kaya, Kajokeji and Morobo have been quiet. 
Independent reports have revealed that the SPLA has put all three towns 
under siege together with the strategic town of Yei. Any SPLA victories 
in this sector would have positive repercussions on the situation in 
Western Equatoria and Bahr El Ghazal, as far as the guerrilla army is 
concerned.
   Attempts by the regime to distract attention away from Eastern 
Equatoria by launching offensives in Bahr El Ghazal and against Western 
Equatoria have so far failed. The attempts to arrange, through bribery, 
bases in the Central African Republic and Zaire, in order to launch 
attacks on Western Equatoria, have so far proved fruitless. The local 
officials have noted Khartoum's generosity and have made higher demands 
for payment. Khartoum's financial resources are limited and each time 
its representatives return to Sudan for more money, they get back to the 
CAR and Zaire to be faced by new officials, all expecting some kind of 
payment. Bribery is proving to be an expensive and inefficient way of 
conducting the war.
   The SPLA is still in control of Western Equatoria and its forces are 
ready for the regime's offensives from whatever direction. The most 
likely routes are from Wau across the Bo River, or from Rumbek, although 
the direct route from Juba via Rokon, Mundri and Maridi might also be 
targeted. There is an old hilly route from Yei to Maridi which the SPLA 
is also monitoring.
   The schism in the SPLA in 1991 handed much of Upper Nile to the 
regime because the SPLA-United forces, later to be renamed the Southern 
Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM), chose to work with the regime 
against the mainstream SPLA. Commander Nyuon's forces have since April 
1995 been controlling the overland route from Malakal to Bor and on to 
Kapoeta and Torit, by being in control of Ayot, Akobo and Watt. His 
forces are even siad to have reached as far North as the Zaraf Island of 
Panjak. In order to take advantage of this overland route in the dry 
season, the regime now has to fight its way for almost the entire 300 
kilometers  from Malakal. Commander Nuyon's SSIM forces are reported to 
have reached Doleib Hill, some fifteen hundred kilometers from Malakal.
   The regime's propaganda machine has released many stories in recent 
weeks reporting that 30,000 fresh troops have been airlifted to Juba, 
ready to take the battle to the SPLA.  The story made impressive reading 
for the Northern public but did little to threaten the SPLA in Eastern 
Equitoria because the truth is somewhat different. 
   In reality, the regime's press gangs in the North  have rounded up 
any male aged fourteen to twenty-one foolish enough to be seen in 
public. They have been dragged out of homes and schools or mearly 
rounded up off the streets. Instead of taking them to training camps in 
the North, they have been immediately airlifted to camps in Juba, from 
where there is little chance of escape. Forcibly enlisted into the 
Popular Defense Forces (PDF), they are being given rudimentary 
instruction on how to fire a rifle before being despatched to the 
battlefront. It is little wonder that the PDF's causality and mortality 
rates have been so high and its forces so ineffective. More than 3,000 
youngsters died on the battlefield at Awingbul alone in October.
   One of the unspoken tragedies of this press gang policy is that the 
relatives of the young men have no idea what has happened to them or 
where they actually are. Those lucky enough to go to a camp in the North 
rather than straight to the South are kept incommunicado from their 
parents and relatives who are not allowed to visit them. Inquisitive 
relatives are told that the young men have volunteered to train for the 
jihad. Parents of underage boys are told that they are undertaking their 
compulsory national military training in order to qualify them for their 
next stage of education.
   Whilst the regime's policy is quite successful at getting the young 
men to the South, it is less adept at motivating them to fight, even for 
the jihad. Once the young men have been exposed to rotting corpses, 
badly wounded contemporaries and a highly motivated enemy, they become 
utterly demoralized.
   Despite the regime's oft-quoted desire to send a one million strong 
militia force to the South, the SPLA continues to survive and fight 
back, leaving many observers to wonder why the regime even bothers to 
suggest it. mere numbers have proved to be insufficient in the heat of 
battle. Morale and motivation have proved to be far more significant  
and on both counts the SPLA is leaps and bounds ahead of the regime's 
forces.

Zambia
Taxpayers' Money Being Used To Deny Truths

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Lucy Sichone
 
   Lusaka - In the past months, State House has been running continuous 
advertisements in the government-owned media, especially the Zambia 
Daily Mail to refute all "unpleasant" stories carried by The Post on the 
government and President Chiluba. The denials are supposedly meant to 
discredit The Post and project it as a newspaper on a "malicious 
campaign" against Chiluba and his government. In this edition, Zambia 
Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone (right) gives her 
view of the newspaper and the propaganda journalism being orchestrated 
by State House.
   The Post was not my favourite newspaper.  Infact early in 1995 there 
was a period when in exercise of my right and freedom to speech, press 
and communication, I stopped buying The Post with one other independent 
newspaper which I still do not read.
    I began buying and reading The Post when it came to my attention 
that a propaganda department in the tradition of UNIP's Ministry of 
National Guidance but renamed productivity department had been 
established at tax payers expense for the sole purpose of containing The 
Post Newspaper. A propaganda institution is always established as a 
desperate attempt to hide the truth. That is why propaganda journalism 
and information dissemination is a unique speciality of vicious 
dictatorship such as Hitler's propaganda ministry which marketed murder 
of the Jews in gas chambers as hot and refreshing showers for the 
victims.
   Consequently, I considered it my duty to read The Post so that I 
could determine the reasons why Richard Sakala was spending scarce 
public money at a time when hospitals have no free medicines to give to 
under five children on rebutting Post stories especially if the said 
stories are not true and are therefore not worth the consideration of 
intelligent Zambians like myself.
   Upon my resumption of reading The Post and upon close scrutiny of the 
"Kim  II Sung" adverts by the productivity department on the issues 
raised by The Post, it became transparently clear to me that the target 
of the propaganda is not the substance of The Post stories; the target 
is the managing director, Fred M'membe.
   With all due respect to Fred, I should say that he does not posses 
all the awesome qualities and capacity for destruction of Zambia's 
integrity as a nation that are attributed to him by Richard Sakala and  
Chiluba.  But I am aware that Fred possesses a huge ego that attract 
attacks from an individual who believes that he should be the sole 
source of power in an alpha/omega sense. That is why in my case Fred is 
not my friend, like the apostles of Jesus the two (2) of us would not 
agree who between us is the greatest and since I do not manage a 
newspaper and I have no money for productivity advertisements to enable 
me to settle the issue of who is the greatest between Fred and myself; 
it is better we are not friends or foes.
   Coming back to the issue of Fred verses Fred, I was particularly 
intrigued by one of Sakala's advertisements which concerned a story in 
the International Herald Tribue which reported that the supremo of the 
Post Newspapers has been arraigned on so many criminal defamation suits 
that he may total up a record 100 years of imprisonment. 
   The international Herald Tribune is an "Establishment" paper whose 
unquestioned status in the press and media world is aristocratic.  It is 
the newspaper which I have observed is served with champagne in the 
first class cabin of British Airways as I make my measured and dignified 
way to the third class cabin.
   I was concerned therefore that a newspaper of the Herald standard 
could devote space and money on a pedestrian story about the possible 
imprisonment of some small time editor of a small time newspaper in a 
third world country.
   After much reflection and analysis of the issue, it dawned on me that 
the story was not about Fred M'membe and the possibility that he may be 
imprisoned for 100 years; the purpose of that international Herald story 
was about the current government of the Republic of Zambia and its loss 
of credibility, integrity, honest to an extent where the small time 
editor of a small time newspaper can rate a total of a 100 years 
imprisonment for alleging that the President's father is alive and well 
and was mistakenly asking for the fattened pig!!!
   The international Herald could have produced massive copy about 
Zambia's loss of good governance by writing about KK's deportation to 
Malawi, corruption and drug trafficking, obtaining money by false 
pretences ostensibly to write a fictitious constitution to stand the 
test of MMD governance; that the Herald did not use any of these serious 
and substantive issues to demonstrate Zambia's regression to 
dictatorship but instead used copy on mere Fred M'membe is evidence of a 
satirical indictment of our governors in the mode and style of Animal 
Farm.
   In short my dear Richard Sakala the enemy is not  M'membe but 
yourselves (reference Julius Caesar) The International Herald story, the 
non-aligned movement disgust with the intended deportation of KK, the 
not accepted constitution, our general loss of international 
credibility, voter registration apathy, the tunnels fiasco and M'membe's 
International Press Awards, which are irritating to all of us victims of 
press freedom are a consequence of government's misdeeds, dishonesty and 
incompetence.
   Recently, I was horrified to be told by the President himself that 
his humiliation at the non-aligned movement conference over the 
deportation of KK was a set up by KK himself as it was not government's 
intention to consign the former President to Malawi. The reports on KK's 
deportation were issued through the government media by government 
spokesmen.  I only repeat what I have stated elsewhere that it will not 
be possible for this government to change without a true and honesty 
confession of its sins of commission  and omissions and as long as 
Richard Sakala and even Chiluba continues to attribute the consequences 
of their misdeeds to KK, M'membe, Sichone (never one to leave myself 
out) etc there can never be any salvation for themselves or MMD and we 
have KK and UNIP to prove the truism of this political fact.
   The serious problem of the MMD government image as petty, vindictive 
and intolerant because of its incompetence will not be resolved by 
personal attacks on individual citizens their integrity and/or lack of 
it. After all news institutions such as the Herald Tribune , BBC do not 
use The Post  or Fred M'membe as the source of their copy. Any story 
which rates attention of reputable international media is based on 
proper research and collection of data on governance, press freedom, 
electoral systems and so forth. Personal attacks on individual citizens 
merely compound the problem and when the President becomes directly 
involved in the propaganda, the Presidency itself is brought into 
disrepute. In the circumstances, it becomes completely unacceptable, 
indeed it is criminal for the government to abuse tax payers money on 
the kind of advertisements that we have seen against The Post and 
M'membe when the culprits for our international disgrace are in cabinet, 
the police force, electoral commissioner and the public relations unit 
at State House.
   The producer and director of productivity department propaganda 
should be reminded that misuse of public funds on personal issues is a 
criminal offence. And one of these days, sooner rather than later, there 
will be need to answer charges of theft by public servant involving 
millions of Kwacha for personal gain. The Nuremburg trials have laid 
down the principle that "I was only taking orders" is not an adequate 
defence to save the person so accused from imprisonment or capital 
punishment. 
   Those advertisements whose only achievements has been to vest Fred 
M'membe with abilities and capacities which even the President of the 
USA does not possess should come to an end. Attention should be given to 
addressing those issues of misgovernance that have given the government 
a bad name at
international fora.
   Further and at a personal level, the obssession by the productivity 
government and State House with Fred has given him an edge in the 
undeclared contest between him and myself as to who is the greatest. In 
the circumstances I would have no choice but to commence proceedings 
against the Attonery General in which I would pray for the following 
orders: 
   That the productivity department should begin immediate 
advertisements against me for tarnishing Zambian's Human Rights Record 
with my clandestine domestic relations, Sam Ngoma can be retained to do 
the necessary copy with his earnings paid directly to the Times of 
Zambia to ensure that honest journalists like Hicks Sikazwe continue to 
receive their salaries. 
   That the said productivity department should be ordered to arrange a 
Nightline programme and address to the nation by the President  FTJ 
Chiluba in which it can be stated that specially prepared sharp tooth 
will be used to sort out the same domestic relations which I am using to 
tarnish Zambia's human rights record abroad and traumatising leaders 
children like Prince William, Prince Harry, John Major Jnr., Castro etc.
   I will need these orders in order to show Fred M'membe that he is not 
the greatest; that all of us ordinary citizens rate the same kind of 
attention from our government.I will stop here and once again find 
comfort in Byron "if I laugh at any mortal thing, it is that I may not 
weep".

Soccer: Nigeria Given A Chance

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Staff Reporters

   Luaka - Nigeria has been given an ultimatum by the Confederation of 
African Football (CAF) to reconsider pulling out of Africa's soccer 
tournament in South Africa or face sanctions. 
   The CAF gave the military government in Abuja until last evening to 
make it's final decision and threatened to suspend the country, which 
won the Africa Cup in Tunisia in 1994, from international competitions 
for up to six years.
   The ultimatum was  communicated to the Nigerian government yesterday 
in Younde, Cameroun by CAF president Issa Hayatou and  that Guinea was 
being drafted to take the place of Nigeria if they did not respond to 
the ultimatum.
   Nigeria announced last week that it was withdrawing from the Africa 
Cup of Nations on the grounds that South Africa could not gurantee the 
safety of the team in the tournament which starts this next week. 
Nigeria is favourite to win again this year.
   It is believed the Nigerian government was nursing grudges against 
South Africa because of the attitude shown by President Nelson Mandela 
after nine political activists from the minority Ogoni group were 
executed in Nigeria on November 10 last year.
   Mandela was at the forefront of a British Commonwealth campaign to 
isolate Nigeria after the executions. This led to a souring of relations 
between the two countries, both regarded as Africa's super powers. 
Officials in South Africa have said the tournament will go ahead with or 
without Nigeria. The games will be played in Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, 
Durban and Port Elizaberth.

Zambia Has No New Kit For Africa Cup Games

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Reuben Tonga

   Lusaka - Zambia has no new kit for the Africa Cup of Nations after 
their much publicised John Fashanu backed deal with Reebok flopped at 
the last minute when suppliers were reported to be on Christmas holiday. 
Instead Zambia has resorted to cheaply designed uniforms from 
Johannesburg to make up for the blow after efforts to get the London kit 
failed.
   Fashanu's representative a Mace yesterday confirmed the absence of 
the uniform saying arrangements were being made to get it from South 
Africa.
But FAZ treasurer Musa Kasonka denied that there was no kit for the team
saying it would be picked in Bloemfontein, South Africa.
"It is not true to say we have no kit. Because arrangements have been 
made
for the kit. Instead of using the British Reebok we are going to use the
South African one which is better kit than what we had in the last
four-nations competitions," he said.
Zambia had protested over the poor quality of the kit it had been given 
by
Reebok at the Simba four-nations tournament- yellow  and green sets.
A Blue Orchid director Mace, currently in the country to finalise the 
kit
arrangment to be used by Zambia at next week's Africa Cup of Nations,
confirmed that the kit will be made in South Africa.

How Has Entertainment Scene Been In 1995?

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Goodson Machona

   Lusaka - Let us continue with events of last year. Some dissatisfied 
musicians called for the dissolution of the Zambia Union of Musicians ( 
ZUM ) executive claiming it had mishandled cash and was not representing 
the musicians adequately.
   ZUM general secretary, Webster Malama, was even accused of faking the 
death of the Sakala Brother so that he could obtain welfare money. 
However despite the brahuha, ZUM managed to open a music resource centre 
at the Evelyn Hone college to help musicians without instruments.
   Shortly after, ZUM was given a short in the arm when it received a K4 
million grant from the government. However, a planned gig to commemorate 
the death of the national team flopped after the organisers, Jah 
Entertainment, failed to secure a suitable set of musical instruments.
   Lusaka-based playwright, Maurice Tembo formed a drama group called 
Forum For Drama ( FODA ) and lined up a series of programmes which, 
however, are yet to see the light of day.
   This year, the Lusaka theatre club degenerated into some rough house 
catering for boozers. Club manager, Norris Malauzi admitted that there 
was a problem but attributed the lack of artistic activity to the fact 
that most of the time the auditorium was booked by outsiders. 
   And, as matters degenerated, the playhouse was gutted but members 
managed to raise K20 million to refurbish the joint. On a brighter note, 
playwright Maurice Tembo made an appearance on the British Broadcasting 
Corporation television programme "Great Railways Journey."
   Tembo
   And while Tembo was shining on BBC, a University of Zambia student, 
Anderson Ngulube was awarded $5,000 by an American organisation for his 
poetry but he was unable to go and receive the award as he could not 
raise money for an air ticket.
   Another author, Beenwell Sinyangwe, had his book "Quills of Desire" 
mentioned in the coveted African Book Publishing Records ( ABPR ) while 
Zambian artist, Joe Muzala, was invited to the prestigious South African 
award exhibition which was held in South Africa sometime in June.
   In August, artistes of all shades converged at the Star Market and 
held a two day bash to commemorate the passing of former radio dee jay, 
Timmy Mvula. New Generation front man, Frank Chitembwe, flew to the 
United Kingdom and recorded a self titled solo album featuring some 
Samba, fusion of Zambian rock and gospel.
   About the same time too, emergent singer James Ngoma recorded a debut 
album entitled "Chamanyazi" which performed relatively well on the local 
market.   
   Amayenge
   The Amayenge had to cut short their American tour after they 
encountered problems. According to band spokesman, Brian Chilala, their 
promoter made off with their earnings while the band leader Chris Chali 
had to return home to attend his wife's funeral.
   Raggamufin don, Daddy Zemus, sold the rights to his "Salaula" LP to a 
newly formed promotion outfit Digital Network International but the move 
was condemned by most local musicians. For the first time, local 
musicians got together and petitioned the Zambia National Broadcasting 
Corporation ( ZNBC ) to begin paying them copyright royalties for any 
song or video's played on ZNBC.
   Shortly after, chairman of the Zambia Copyrights Society ( ZAMCOPS ) 
Jagari Chanda, was invited by the World Copyrights Organisation ( WBO ) 
to attend a copyright seminar in Switzerland.
   Towards the end of the year, a white girl was picked to represent 
Zambia at the Miss World pageant but the move was not without 
controversy. But perhaps the saddest moment of the year was when veteran 
singer, Derek Mbao, passed away after an illness while in prison.
   "Its the saddest moment in the history of Zambian music," ZUM general 
secretary, Webster Malama moaned. And before our tears could dry, the 
music fraternity lost yet another good musician in former Witch 
guitarist, Emmanuel Makulu.
   Tshala Muana
   Foreign singers made forays into the country.  Zairean sassy singer, 
Tshala Muana breezed in.  She was followed by another Zairean Yondo 
Sister.  A month later Le General, Dafao jetted in.  But his shows were 
far from impressive. Zambian singers based in foreign lands also paid a 
courtesy call to their
mother land.  
   Sweden-based singer Ken Simuyemba came into the country and so did 
the Ubale Girls and guitar virtuoso, Rikki Illilonga. The women ganged 
up and came up with a project called Women In Music  to promote women 
musicians.  Shortly after, they organised a talent show for emergent 
female musicians artistes at the Chainama hotel.   They have gone 
further and organised a tour of the Zimbabwe-based Zairean band, the 
Lubumbashi Stars which was be performing at various venues in Lusaka 
over the New Year period.
   Ras Willie
   Ras Willie who was facing a charge of trafficking in obscene material 
was acquitted by the Lusaka High court after the prosecution failed to 
establish a prima facie case against him. The Amayenge's planned tour of 
Zimbabwe fell through after the venues they had ear marked for their 
shows were booked by other people.
   Last week saw the crowning of Tamara Kaluba as Miss Universe-Zambia 
but the choice did not go down well with most revellers. Lastly but 
definitely not the least, the Go Banana's night club and the former 
Kuku's night club were given  new leases of life after extensive 
renovations .
   Hoping you have caught up with 1995, we look forward to taking you 
through 1996 with more and wider entertainment coverage.

Membe Joins Presidential Race

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by  Reuben  Phiri

   Lusaka - Clergyman and human rights activist Reverend Franklin Membe 
yesterday declared he was joining the race for the Zambian presidency in 
the forthcoming elections during a press conference at Lusaka's Fairview 
Hotel.
   Membe said that he had intended to contest for presidency in the year 
2001 but has been compelled to do it this year  because  "the rate at 
which the MMD government is going is dangerous".
   "I do not see any seriousness on the part of Chiluba to avert 
bloodshed in the country," Membe said. Asked what his chances were 
against MMD's  President Chiluba and UNIP's Kenneth Kaunda, Membe said 
with adequate funds and a fair election he could win.
   "Its never too late," he said. " MMD came together in less than a 
year." Membe said he will stand on a political party whose name he will 
be announcing soon after completing consultations. And Membe accused 
President Chiluba, without adequate proof, of using undemocratic methods 
to hold on to power.
   "He is recruiting more policemen and soldiers when people are 
suffering because he wants to use them to hold on to power,"Membe 
said."Because Kaunda has announced his intention to contest presidency, 
there is money for two thousand police officers."
   Reverend Membe is the estranged husband to local government and 
housing deputy minister Wendy Sinkala Membe.

Zambia Has No Policy On Information Technology

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Nkandu Kapepula

   Lusaka - If Kabunda Kayongo, the fourth minister in as many years at 
science and technology ministry, keeps her end of year promise to the 
information technology (IT), 1996 could be the dawn of a promising era.  
   On December 1, Kayongo used Computers Society of Zambia seventh 
computers communications fair as an excuse to declare she will roll out 
a national IT policy this year. Could this be another of those empty 
slogans? 
   That is not an uncharitable question to ask. Incidentally, this is 
not the first time government has gone public about the urgent need of 
an IT policy. Nor is it true to infer that there is no IT policy at the 
moment. It is there - a monumental patchwork of here-today-gone tomorrow 
guidelines.
   As far as history of both Kaunda and Chiluba administration goes, the 
IT portfolio has never been distinctly delegated. The result is that 
today four ministers are directly involved with the IT enterprise and 
are ostensibly pulling in different directions.
   Other than the science and technology ministry, communications and 
transport, information and broadcasting, and commerce, trade and 
industry, bureaucrats have separately courted the IT community with 
different agendas. Computer Society of Zambia, for one, gives the 
impression that there is no difference between the four. It collaborates 
with any of them as it deems convenient.
   And there lies the critical problem of lack of focus and absence of 
unity of purpose. The knock-on effect is that the IT industry is on the 
back step. Witness the confusion on trade tariffs, legislation on 
intellectual property rights, the resistance to open the telecoms market 
and a discordant skills development effort.
   As far as Penzanomics stretch, a compact disc (CD) bearing Yondo 
Sister's music is of the same value  as one with Micr-osoft's Office 95 
groupware! That is not all. Information and broadcasting ministry sees 
no impropriety in lumping computer programmes with poetry and music in 
its copyright laws. 
    Enter communications and transport ministry. It hand-picks the board 
of directors of the Communication Authority, the nat-ion's telecoms 
industry regulator, without representation from the native computer 
industry. Either the ministry is not convinced computers, communications 
and electronic media are converging and that it needs well-versed 
advisors in these fields or it has time-warped.
   When primary and pre-schools across the border in Mozambique and 
Namibia are being equipped with donated computer systems-thanks to their 
creative bureaucrats- God knows when the ever uncertain private 
initiatives of our universities will yield an IT prog-rammes.
   Far more striking, the guys at SGS and Zambia Revenue Authority do 
not care whether our nascent IT industry swims or sinks. Never mind that 
there is absolutely no computer hardware manufacturing here to protect 
from imports, their business is to make Zambians pay more than even the 
manufacturers demand.  
   Yes, SGS has been instructed to ignore invoice prices demanded by 
manufacturers and substitute them with what is in its 'opinion' is the 
right value. The reason is that the treasury under Ronald Penza, whom 
even MMD vigilantes cannot entrust to lead their obscure finance and 
economic committee, must collect more taxes to pay its hopelessly 
bloated civil services, finance dubious jaunts etc.
Surprisingly,  political rhetoric is heavily skewed towards hoodwinking 
a supposedly unassuming populace that this is the ideal climate to lure 
foreign investors. What is attractive about setting up a shop where one 
has to pay for receiving a call (not sending) on cellular phone? Not in 
an age where technology has improved so much that before long the cost 
of dialing Lusaka from New York would be the same as ringing one's next 
door neighbour, that is not science fiction but reality.
   For inspiration, India is a ready reference point,. Its software 
industry grew more than 50 per cent last year posting a turnover of 850 
million United States dollars. This is far much more than our export 
earnings from copper sales in the
corresponding period.

Zambians Used 7M Condoms In 1995

Post of Zambia
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Masautso Lungu

   Lusaka - About 7 million Maximum Condoms were used in Zambia in 1995 
alone, racking in about K52.5 million of income to local maximum agents, 
the Zambia Social Marketing Projects (ZSMP).
   And ZSMP has taken another step further to Reality, a female condom.  
"We've six months in which to access the market for Reality , but it is 
selling well in our outlets," said ZSMP marketing manager, Chris Mukkuli 
in an interview yesterday. "For instance we sold about 1, 500 packets of 
Reality in December, and we  hope that it will improve though there are 
more men buying it than women."  Mukkuli also disclosed that there has 
been overwhelming response from the public in Maximum Condoms.
   "We sold 6.7 million condoms in 1995. The level of acceptance and 
awareness is so high that every sexually active person would want to use 
the Maximum Condom," said Mukkuli. "That it is our business to see 
people using condoms to prevent the spread of the deadly diseases and 
promote family planning. "
   And the stores manager at S.J Patel Supermarket, Henry Mangani, is 
delighted by the figure sold which is close to the national population 
of
about 8 million people.
"We're proud that Zambia Social Marketing Project has sold 7 million 
condoms and I feel we've contributed to this figure as we've sold 
maximum condoms since they were introduced on the market," said Mangani. 
   Last year's figure accounts for over 50 per cent of all the sales 
ZSMP made between 1992 when it launched maximum and 1994. Between this 
period ZSMP sold only 12.2 million condoms. 
   Maximum is also changing the packaging of the condoms to make it even 
more appealing and convenient to carry. "We will this year change from 
the square shaped box to a pillow shaped package which will be more 
convenient for the consumer to carry," Mukkuli said.

Zambia Stock Trading Slowed by Small Number Of Firms

Post of Zambia
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Sipo Kapumba

   Lusaka - Trade at the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has been seriously 
affected by the low number of companies being floated there and the 
general poor state of the economy, experts have said.
   LuSE general manager Charles Mate and Finance Securities general 
manager Nduba Namoonde said, in separate interviews, on Wednesday that 
an increase in the number of listed companies from the present two, 
Chilanga Cement and Rothmans of Pall Mall, and the stabilisation of the 
economy could boost the level of activity on the LuSE.
And Mate said companies on the stock exchange could be likened to 
commodities and "the wider the variety on offer, the more likely the 
public was to being attracted to trade in them".
   However, Mate said the stock exchange cannot dictate to the 
government through the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund the pace at which 
companies should be floated to the public because this was their 
prerogative.
   This year Zambia Oxygen, Zambia Sugar and Zambia Breweries shares are 
expected to be listed on the stock exchange but their timetables is yet 
to be announced.
Mate also said the stabilisation of the economy through a reduction in 
inflation which in-turn could lead to a drop in interest rates would 
present shares as an attractive option to the traditional method of 
saving money in Zambia which is through maintaining bank accounts. "The 
wider participation of individuals in share ownership was an important 
objective of the privatisation programme which the LuSE was there to 
facilitate by enabling as many people as possible have access to shares 
in companies being privatised," Mate said.
   Namoonde said there is need for tax concessions to companies go 
public if the stock exchange is to develop. "For the stock exchange to 
grow the government needs to create a conducive atmosphere through tax 
concessions for companies which want to float their shares to the public 
on the exchange," he said. "The government should give tax relief to 
companies floating their shares to the public so that more are willing 
to do so."
   In addition, Namoonde said the government could help put public 
confidence into the exchange by stabilising the economy so that people 
do not simply concentrate on consumption but also start saving even by 
way of share ownership.

Controversy Slows Voter Registration

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Masautso Phiri

   Lusaka - Lack of visible control, direction and coordination of the 
work of the Israeli firm, Nikuv, contracted by the government to prepare 
the voters' register and cards is said to be frustrating the work of the 
Electoral Commission.
   And neither the government, through the office of the Vice-President, 
nor the Electoral Commission, through the Elections Office, seems to 
have discernible control over, or even knowledge of, the activities of 
Nikuv. And this apparent 'mystery' over Nikuv seems to be compounding 
the fears of the opposition that the ruling MMD wants to use the firm  
to rig the elections.  
   This 'invisible' control of Nikuv also seems to be one of the major 
obstacles to the smooth completion of the exercise.
   The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's lack of supervisory 
powers over Nikuv is said to have left the commissioners and officers 
frustrated. Issues of control of Nikuv, funding, cards distribution and 
registration appear to be the worrisome issue at play.
   "We have nothing to do with either the contract to register voters or 
Nikuv," said chairman of the Electoral Commission, justice Weston 
Muzyamba in a telephone interview last week.
   But it is not only the Electoral Commission and the Elections Office 
that knows little, or nothing, about Nikuv, the permanent secretary in 
the office of the Vice-President, to whom the firm is believed to be 
reporting, also seems to be uneasy about the firm's voters' registration 
business. 
   "I am not in a better position to discuss the subject. You have 
caught me off hand. I am not able to comment," said permanent secretary 
in the office of the Vice-President, Philip Daka, in a telephone 
interview last Friday. He was asked to comment, among other issues, on 
the government's ability to distribute the 4 million cards to voters who 
exercise estimates to registered by next week Wednesday. And the cards 
would only be available for distribution to the registered voters 
sometime in February.
   Opposition parties have expressed worry that some voters may not 
return to registration centres to collect their cards and they fear for 
the security of those cards whose owners would either have died or are 
unable to collect them for one reason or another.
   And the Electoral Commission, although appearing unhappy with this 
arrangement, is not prepared to criticise it.
   "This is what has been decided by government. Find out from the 
government chief spokesman if the elections commission was involved in 
this," said Electoral Commission spokesman Joel Sikazwe said in an 
interview last week. The Electoral Commission and Elections Office's 
frustration were also noticed and observed by leaders of the opposition 
who they met last week.
   "I noticed the difficult circumstances they are working under and it 
showed they were not happy about the arrangement," Zambia Democratic 
Congress deputy secretary Azwell Banda observed in an interview last 
week. 
   "They said they had recommended the issuance of cards immediately 
after registration but the government refused." 
   But not even Nikuv officials, based at Lusaka's Hotel 
Intercontinental, are willing to explain their activities.
   "I am also a technician and I cannot say anything. I don't know what 
it has to do with you, anyway," said projects manager, Setton, in an 
interview last week when asked to explain his firm's role. "Are you a 
Christian, the Bible says don't force."

Major Parties Meet

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)
January 3, 1996 (19960103) 
 
   Lusaka - Four presidents of opposition parties will today meet to 
formalise their common stand on several national issues.
   Secretaries of UNIP, Liberal Progressive Front and National Party 
have met three times to pave the way for today's meeting. 
   "The first meeting agreed on three issues - voter registration and 
Nikuv, constitutional reform and President Frederick Chiluba's 
citizenship," said special assistant for press to UNIP president Muhabi 
Lungu. "But we unanimously agreed to suspend discussion of President's 
citizenship because it might overshadow serious issues." 
   Today's meeting follows an earlier meeting between UNIP president 
Kenneth Kaunda and LPF president Rodger Chongwe at which an outline of 
common understanding was agreed. The two parties were later joined by 
the National Party and for today's meeting by the Zambia Democratic 
Congress.
   And yesterday UNIP officials were tight-lipped about the venue of the 
meeting.
   "We cannot announce the venue before the presidents agree," said  
UNIP's vice secretary general Fenwick Chifunda.

State House Snubs Group

Post of Zambia (Lusaka)

by Goodson Machona
 
   Lusaka - State House has thrown out an offer by the Foundation for 
Democratic Process (FODEP) to mediate in the on-going 'conflict' between 
President Chiluba and Post editor-in-chief Fred M'membe.
   In a telephone interview yesterday, President Chiluba's public 
relations and press aide, Richard Sakala, said the issues raised by 
M'membe in his letter to Chiluba were criminal and only the courts can 
settle the matter.
   "There is no question of reconciliation between President Chiluba and 
Fred M'membe," Sakala said.  "What is there is for the two parties to 
meet in court."
   But Women for Change executive director, Emily Sikazwe, says that if 
what M'membe wrote in his letter  was criminal then the President's 
attacks on him, to which he was responding, should also be criminalised. 
"If what M'membe wrote to the President is criminal then the President's 
remarks on M'membe on the Night Line  programme is also criminal," 
Sikazwe said.
   She said it was unfortunate that President Chiluba would like to take 
M'membe to court without waiving his own immunity so that he too can be 
prosecuted.
   "The President has immunity and it would be grossly unfair to take 
M'membe to court without waiving his immunity," Sikazwe said. 
   But FODEP general secretary, Bishop John Mambo, has maintained that 
his organisation will still go ahead and mediate in the stand off.
   "As FODEP we feel we should mediate in the conflict between  
President Chiluba and Mr M'membe," Mambo said in an interview yesterday, 
adding: "This week we will be writing to President Chiluba so that we 
can arrange a meeting for these people."
   He said going to court is not the best solution.
   "Court proceedings take between three to five years to conclude and 
that will not help anybody," Mambo said, adding: "We don't have to wait 
until M'membe or Masautso Phiri (Post special projects editor) has an 
artificial accident for people to act." 
   He dispelled claims by UNIP chairman, Malimba Masheke, that  "FODEP 
and MMD are one".
  "I am above a person that can be used by anybody," Mambo seethed and 
noted that it was President Chiluba's special assistant for press, 
Richard Sakala who is "not courageous enough to call M'membe to State 
House to discuss the issue. That is why we have decided to put a brake 
on this issue".
   But ZIMT president, Alfred Zulu, said no Non Governmental 
Organisation has the right to mediate in the matter.
   "If the President feels offended its up to the judiciary to take 
effect and not an NGO," Zulu said in an interview on Monday.
   The 'conflict' between Chiluba and M'membe has generated a lot of 
interest among civic and political leaders who have criticised FODEP for 
the stand it took over the letter written to President Chiluba by 
M'membe soon after his Christmas eve ZNBC  Night Line Radio programme.
   The Zambia Democratic Congress, the Zambia Civic Education 
Association, the National Party, the Liberal Progressive Party, the 
United National Independence Party (UNIP), the Zambia Independent 
Monitoring Team, the Inter African Network for Human Rights and 
Development (Afronet ) and the Catholic Commission for Peace and Justice 
have all come out in support of M'membe and criticised FODEP's stand 
which they described as "not neutral".
   Meanwhile State House has continued to run full page articles in the 
government owned and controlled newspapers accusing M'membe of being 
unpatriotic and of waging an international "anti-Zambia campaign".

Zambia and Egypt
Soccer: Zambians Predict 2-1 Victory Against Egypt

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Mildred Mulenga, PANA Staff Correspondent 

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian soccer fans on Friday predicted their team 
will beat Egypt 2-1 in the quarter-finals of the 1996 Africa Cup of 
Nations to be played Saturday at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, 
South Africa. 
   Some 80 percent of Zambian soccer fans who called into a programme on 
national radio Friday morning said Zambia, runners-up in the 1994 Africa 
Cup of Nations played in Tunsia would the tough Egyptian side 2-1. Only 
one caller said Zambia would be beaten by Egypt. He predicted a 0-1 
margin. 
   Zambia who qualified for the quarter-finals on Wednesday after 
beating Sierra Leone 4-0. The Zambian coach Roald Poulsen said Zambia's 
quarter final match against Egypt would be "tough". A local analyst 
Ponga Liwewe said Thursday evening that Zambia has to play a more 
attacking game because the Egyptians are good at holding the ball and 
are "solid" at the back. "We need other players to get to the scoring 
point to put in goals in the first half," Ponga said. 
   Another analyst Anthony Kasolo said Zambia has to cut the Egyptians 
wings were they are known to run the ball well. He said the Zambians 
should also avoid lettting the Egyptians to break their defense in 
counter attacks. The two also expressed concern at what was Zambia's 
relaxed style after scoring five goals and two goals against Burkina 
Faso and Sierra Leone in the first half. 
   Zambia, who during the opening match against Algeria drew 0-0 have so 
far scored nine goals in two games after beating Burkina Faso 5-1 and 
Sierra Leone 4-0 to qualify for the quarter-finals. With five golas to 
his credit, Zambia's skipper Kalusha Bwalya is currently the top scorer 
at the ongoing tournament.

Mozambique
Outrage Grows Over Interior Minister's Remarks

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   MAPUTO, Mozambique - In spite of growing public outrage at his 
remarks, Mozambican interior minister Manuel Antonio has defended his 
position that prisoners have only themselves to blame if they die of 
hunger in police cells. 
   Asked by the daily paper "Noticias" to clarify his position, Antonio 
simply repeated that his ministry does not have the money to buy food 
for prisoners, and that they are in jail because of the crimes they 
committed. 
   "I repeat my statements," said Antonio. "Who asked them to commit 
crimes ?" 
   Many of those incarcerated in prisons run by the police are in fact 
not convicted criminals but detainees awaiting trial. The minister did 
not seem to make a distinction between the two. 
   In an interview published on Monday, Antonio is reported to have 
said: "These men who die, it's really because there's no food to give 
them. They're not maltreated." But the minister added: "A man has to 
die, he has his limits. When his time's up, it's over. He goes. It's not 
because they've been maltreated by the police." 
   The Mozambican Human Rights League has sent a strong protest to 
President Joaquim Chissano, suggesting that Antonio be sacked. The 
minister told "Noticias" he did not care about the league's stance. 
   One of the country's leading lawyers, Carlos Cauio, head of the 
Mozambican Bar Association, described the minister's words as "an 
assault on human dignity". 
   The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Maputo, Cardinal Alexandre dos 
Santos, told the independent news sheet Mediafax, "I intend to speak 
with the minister of the interior. I think that by talking we can 
resolve a lot of things." He described the fate of prisoners as 
"worrying", and added "perhaps it's not just a food shortage -- it's 
because the food is being stolen."

Africa-at-Large
Weekly Press Review

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent

   DAKAR, Senegal - War and soccer were the issues attracting the 
attention of the Africa Press this week. 
   Newspapers in Addis Ababa and Dakar commented on the ongoing Africa 
Cup of Nations. 
   The Monitor of Addis Ababa focused on Nigeria's absence from the 20th 
tournament. "Almost everyone is affected by the absence of the Super 
Eagles," it said. It wondered if this was not fatal: "To Mandela? To 
Nigerian strongman Sani Abacha and to African football? "The only losers 
are African soccer and the football crazy African fans who put soccer 
before politics," it said. 
   Nigeria, it continued, was "by all account" the best football nation 
in Africa. The country, it added, was "big in many ways": population, 
economy, oil and politics but for the average African, all these factors 
matter little. "Soccer comes first and here lies the big 
disappointment," it said. Recounting how Nigerian fans travelled 
worldwide to support the Super Eagles it concluded: "
   The ultimate losers...will definitely be ordinary Nigerian fans who 
had nothing to do with Abacha's decision. "When elephants fight, it is 
the grass that suffers most. What a fitting African adage," it said. 
   As the event moves closer to the final, Dakar's Le Soleil noted that 
after the initial surprise in the tournament "the entire tournament had 
become an affair for the favourites": Algeria, Egypt and Zambia. These 
countries, it said, "have logically bulldozed their way to the 
quarterfinal." 
   From soccer politics to real politik, several Nigerian papers 
condemned the coup d'etat in Sierra Leone which overthrew Capt. 
Valentine Strasser. This condemnation coincided with the visit to 
Nigeria of the new military leader in Freetown, Brig. Julius Bio. 
   The Daily Sketch, of Ibadan, noted wearily that coups used to be the 
business of colonels and their superiors in fairly backward countries. 
They struck in Greece in 1967, in Portugal in 1974 and Spain in 1981. 
"They were then the sick men of Europe, economically and politically. 
Though their economies are yet to become ruddy pink, their politics has 
firmly stablised, a democracy that works, that the military readily 
surbodinates itself to," it noted. 
   "In West Africa, young officers appear to see coup-making as a bit of 
mess fun," it said. The semi-official paper noted that Strasser had set 
general elections for Feb. 26. "Many important Sierra Leoneans took him 
seriously enough to put themselves forward as presidential candidates. 
The new rulers, former lieutenants of the deposed one, have said that 
they are all for a return to democratic rule. But they have not been as 
illuminating with regard to when this will be," it said. 
   But Kenya's largest circulation daily newspaper, the Daily Nation, 
noted that Bio had, in fact, been quick to assure the world he would not 
derail the elections. "How times have changed. A time was when those 
staging coups across Africa did not feel compelled to justify their 
action as swiftly as Brigadier Bio is trying to do," it said. 
   It wondered whether Bio's junta would follow through with elections 
as scheduled "or will they borrow a leaf from another West African 
nation to stay just within reach of another coup, another day?" it said 
in implicit reference to Nigeria's situation. 
   While Strasser alleged that he was ousted because he wanted to 
maintain the election schedule, Bio said that he overthrew Strasser 
precisely because the captain did not really want to hand over to a 
democratically elected civilian government. "
   At the root of the confusion is the fact that members of the 
country's ruling military were not convinced that the military has had 
its fill of political leadership," the Nigerian Tribune, published in 
Ibadan, said. "The division within the hierarchy of the Sierra Leonean 
military epitomises the crisis and perhaps helplessness of African 
states which have been under military rule," it added. 
   For its part, The Vanguard of Lagos, noted that Africa had 
demonstrated its commitment to democracy but Sierra Leone was among the 
uneviable trio [the others being Gambia and Nigeria] still under 
military dictatorships. "We expect the new leaders to meet the people's 
quest for democracy so that the country's name could be deleted from the 
bad list. "
   To this end, Brigadier-General Bio and his clique should do nothing 
that would lead to the postponement of the elections already slated for 
February 26 this year," it said. 
   The press in Burundi, Kenya and Zaire commented on the suggestion by 
United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali that UN troops be 
sent to neighbouring Zaire in readiness to intervene in Burundi to stem 
the genocide shaping up, it seems, in degree and fashion as had happened 
in neighbouring Rwanda. 
   Nairobi's "Daily Nation" castigated the U.N for dilly-dallying on 
whether or not to send the peacekeeping. However, it exonerated Boutros-
Boutros Ghali and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, 
of blame. Despite its nasty experiences at peacekeeping, it said, "it 
would be an ironic tragedy" if, unwilling to preempt a tragedy now, "it 
later spends millions in a tribunal to investigate and indict murderers 
in what may well become the Burundi genocide." 
   The Burundi government-owned newspaper, Le Renouveau, said "foreign 
intervention will never solve Burundi's problems." Instead of a "foreign 
occupation force", it said, there should be "massive aid" to the 
country's millions of orphans. 
   Le Compatriote of Kinshasa said that the "international community and 
African countries should threaten the Burundi government with sanctions 
so as to force it to end the violance against civilians." 
   La Manchette, also a Kinshasa paper, said given the gravity of the 
situation, the United Nations seretary-general should again plea for the 
dispatch of UN troops to Zaire. 
   But La Nation, a Bujumbura privately-owned weekly, said that only 
Zaire's Mobuto Sese Seko would gain by this. "It would allow him to 
emerge from his world political isolation and gain centre stage." Rather 
than sending troops, it said, the U.N "should give the regular [Burundi] 
army the money it would have to spend maintaining the Blue Helmets, or 
help the Burundian judiciary arrest the putschists and masterminds of 
the October 1993 massacres." 
   Another tragedy discussed by Ibadan's Daily Sketch, was Liberia. It 
attacked ULIMO faction leader Roosevelt Johnson for acquiring weapons, 
ambushing West African peacekeeping troops and killing and capturing 
scores of them. It noted that many of the dead were Nigerians and that 
the peacekeeping commander, a Nigerian, said he would not send his men 
to incapacitate Johnson. 
   To add insult to injury, it said Johnson "sounded unrepentant, even 
exultant," during a radio interview. "An ant has painfully tweaked the 
tusk of an elephant and he appeared to be getting away with it," it 
said. This, it said, was "all very well" if one was dealing with an 
opponent that did not suffer from a superiority complex. "Mr. Johnson 
appears to," it said. "He should be given the Prince Johnson treatment. 
He should be made to beg to be taken out of Liberia," it said. 
   The World Bank representative in Nairobi, Steve O'Brien, last week 
warned that it was unlikely that donor countries would give funds to 
poor nations come July 1996 because no pledges had been forthcoming. 
   Against this forecast, the Kenya Times, the ruling party newspaper, 
said: "The bottom line is that African nations, which have hitherto 
heavily relied on donor assistance, must contrive ways of pulling 
themselves out of the economic hardships by their own bootstraps." 
Pinpointing one of Africa's problems as the lack of a sound 
technological base it advised thus: "All Africa ought to do is to learn 
how to benefit from international patents like they have done in Japan, 
South Korea and Taiwan and other countries who survived on borrowed 
technology. This will make Africa self-reliant."

Kenya
Shilling Hits Record Low

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Kenyan shilling hit its sharpest fall in almost 
a year Thursday when it plummeted to 59.1 from 55.50 to the US dollar. 
   The fall came as the World Bank announced it had suspended further 
disbursement of loans to the East African state after government over-
expenditure and corruption in high places. The bank said it would review 
disbursement of funds to Kenya in a joint mission with the International 
Monetary Fund. 
   Kenya was to have presented two loan applications for USD 165 million 
to the bank's board in Washington Thursday. The loans were to finance to 
major road projects. Most of Kenya's bilateral donors are withholding 
funds until the country and the World Bank and the IMF sort out their 
differences.

Benin
Soglo Threatens To Rule By Edict

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Ali Idrissou Toure, PANA Correspondent


   COTONOU, Benin - Benin president Nicephore Soglo threatened Thursday 
evening on national television to use edicts to implement the state's 
general budget and the Third Structural Adjustment Programme (PAS-III), 
which has been postponed three times by parliament. 
   Speaking at the end of a meeting with employees at the National Oil 
Products Marketing Company (SONACOP), Soglo said he would be "obliged to 
use the mechanisms provided for by the institutions" if there was a 
"block" or "hindrance to the normal operation of the State". 
   Benin's parliament has demanded that the government renegotiate the 
terms of the structural adjustment programme with the World Bank. But 
Soglo has said this is "a rejection" of the programme which has already 
been approved by the bank's board. 
   A decision taken by the bank cannot be put into question, he added. 
"Our country needs foreign resources and a budget to meet the challenges 
of 1996," the president said. This programme has stirred differences 
between the government, on the one hand, and the unions and parliament 
on the other.

Burundi
Bujumbura Police Arrest Union Leaders, Journalists

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Police in Bujumbura have arrested several trade 
unionists, politicians and journalists suspected of being ringleaders in 
a recent one-week strike. 
   The strike, from Jan. 15 to 21, was called to force the resignation 
of the government of President Sylivestre Ntibantunya, on allegations 
that he has been secretly been backing Hutu guerrillas in their fight 
against the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army. 
   The latest arrests came a few days after that of Deo Niyonzima, who 
heads a Tutsi group known as "The Youth Solidarity for the Defence of 
Minorities", which spearheaded the work-stoppage. Niyomzima was arrested 
by the police after a James Bond-type chase in the streets of the 
Burundian capital. 
   A trade unionist at the National Institute of Public Security, 
Innocent Massunzu, was arrested Thursday evening for his alleged role in 
the strike. As part of a crackdown against the strike's leaders, the 
government has placed Hitimana Mathias and Cyrille Sigejeje under house 
arrest for the past 20 days. 
   Hitimana is Chairmen (People's Reconciliation Party while Sigejeje 
heads the Rally for Democracy and Social Development. The government has 
also detained two independent journalists, 
   Doweri Dismas of the weekly "La Balance" and Jean-Marie Bizimana of 
"La Nation", another weekly. Doweri allegedly wrote articles that 
insulted cabinet ministers while Bizimana is accused of trying to divide 
and demoralise the army during the strike. 
   The Tutsi-dominated army did not back the strike. Reliable sources in 
the justice ministry said arrest warrants had also been issued for 
secondary school teachers and university lecturers suspected of being 
behind the anti-government work stoppage. 
   At the beginning of the strike, the Tutsi Burundian Prime Minister 
Antoine Nduwayo cautioned the organisers the government would take stern 
action. Burundi has been rocked by political instability and ethnic 
violence since October 1993, after the Hutu democratically elected 
President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated in a failed coup d'etat by 
elements of the Tutsi-dominated army.

Nigeria
Prisons Full of People Awaiting Trial

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Some 35,750 inmates are awaiting trial in Nigerian 
prisons, some for the past 10 years, according Internal Affairs Minister 
Baba Gana Kingibe. 
   These suspects represent about 65 percent of the total 55,000 inmates 
in the country's jail houses. At a briefing Thursday in Abuja, the 
nation's capital, the minister said "even convicts are human beings and 
are entitled to basic rights." 
   He said "it is hard enough being behind bars and harder still not to 
be accorded proper care and treatment whilst in prison." To decongest 
the prisons, Kingibe, Nigeria's Foreign Minister until early 1995, urged 
the police and courts to speed the judicial processes. He said the 
"principle of modern-day incarceration emphasises correction in 
preferecne to punishment. 
   Part of this principle is the entitlement of the prisoner to decent 
environment and decent feeding." To this end, the minister said 
government recently increased the inmates' feeding allowance by 100 
percent from 30 to 60 Naira per head. ( 85 Naira exchanges for one 
U.S.dollar in the populous West African country where the minimum wage 
is below 25 dollars a month).

Nigeria and Sierra Leone
Freetown Denies Nigerian Involvement in Coup

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - The secretary to Sierra Leone's new military 
government, John Benjamin, has dismissed speculation that Nigeria had 
anything to do with the recent coup in his country. 
   He told journalists in Freetown Thursday it was baseless to accuse 
Nigeria of involvement in the January 16 bloodless coup that toppled 
Capt. Valentine Strasser and swept his former deputy, Brig. Julius Maada 
Bio, to power. 
   Nigerian defence minister Brig.Gen. Fred Chijuka was the first to 
deny any nigerian involvement in the palace coup, which he described as 
an internal issue for Sierra Leone. Benjamin, who also served as 
secretary to the deposed Strasser regime, however, confirmed that 
Strasser's decision to vote against Nigeria in the last Commonwealth 
Summit in Aukland, New Zealand, had caused a big rift in Sierra Leone's 
former cabinet. 
   He was quoted as saying "Nigeria has done so much for us and there 
was no justification for antagonising her." The Commonwealth Summit 
suspended Nigeria over the November 10 execution of nine of its citizens 
convicted for murder. They included the author Ken Saro-Wiwa. 
   The Gambia was said to be the only African country that voted against 
the Commonwealth action on Nigeria. 
   Nigeria has troops in Sierra Leone, helping the government fight the 
four-year-old war against the rebel Revolutionary Front. Bio has visited 
Nigerian military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha to condole him on the recent 
death of eldest son, Ibrahim. He died whenthe presidential jet in which 
he was travelling crashed.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Sierra Leonean soccer lovers have expressed 
disappointment at their country's elimination from the ongoing 20th 
Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa. 
   Freetown residents wore long faces Thursday after Zambia trounced the 
Leone Stars 4-0 Wednesday in their last group match to send the Sierra 
Leoneans on an early exit from the tournament that had provided a 
welcome diversion from the political crisis at home. Sierra Leone saw 
yet another military coup on January 16. The Stars had beaten Burkina 
Faso 2-1 in their opeining match, with 16-year-old Mohammed Kallon 
showing a lot of promise. Their 2-1 loss to Algeria in the second match 
had still left fans with some hope until the Zambians nailed the Stars' 
coffin.

Nigeria Alert Over Reported Hazardous Waste Import

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria has put its customs and immigration units on 
a red alert over impending delivery of a consignment of hazardous waste 
ordered by an unnamed firm. 
   Officials said here Friday the warning had been received by the 
Transport Ministry, which in turn directed the customs services to take 
action. All the area comptrollers have been instructed "to beef up 
surveillance and put officers on red alert" to foil the attempt to 
smuggle the waste into the country, the officials said. 
   The port health division is also said to be taking precautionary 
measures. Details of the alleged waste and the importer have not been 
given, for what officials called "diplomatic and security reasons." 
   Nigeria was a victim of toxic waste dump by an Italian firm in 1988. 
The dump in Koko, midwestern Nigeria, sensitised the country and put her 
in the forefront of international anti-dump campaign. Nigeria set up the 
Federal Environmental Protection Agency following the incident.
   A year later, Abuja promulgated a tough decree, prescribing life jail 
for any person convicted of importing hazardous waste into the country. 
Collectively, African coutries also adopted the Bamako Convention 
forbidding the trans-boundary transportation of toxic wastes.

   LAGOS, Nigeria - President Bill Clinton and Sadam Hussein of Iraq are 
among world leaders that have condoled Nigeria's military ruler Gen. 
Sani Abacha, over last week's death of his eledest son in a presidential 
jet crash, officials said Friday. 
   Clinton in his message said "the loss of one's loved one is never 
easy, it is doubly difficult when that loved one is so young, talented 
and have his whole life ahead of him." 
   The Iraqi President in his sympathy message said he received with 
"great sorrow the news of the death of Ibrahim and those accompanying 
him in a tragic and unfortunate air accident. Please accept our 
heartfelt condolences" 
   The 29-year-old younger Abacha, was a businessman. He was killed 
along with 14 others on board the British-made Hawker Siddeley 125 jet, 
which crashed near the Kano airport in Northern Nigeria. Aviation and 
Security agencies are still investigating the cause of the crash. 
   Condolence messages also came from Presidents Nelson Mandela of South

Hundreds Of Bank Debtors To Face Trial

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   LAGOS, Ngieria - At least 337 major debtors of 12 failed Nigerian 
banks are to face trial under a new government decree, officials said 
Friday. 
   Prominent politicians, businessmen and traditional rulers are said to 
be on the debtors' list kept by the Nigerian National Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, charged with debt recovery. 
   More than six billion naira are said to be involved in the 12 
insolvent banks (85 naira =1 USD). Details and names of the affected 
people or commencement of trial were not available, but prosecution 
lawyers are said to have been provided with the list. A new decree to 
stem a spate of bank failures in the West African country, prescribes up 
to 21 years inprisonment for a convict, in addition to hefty fines. 
   Five special tribunals are currently trying the chief executives of 
the failed banks. Bank sources say more than 120 of the bank chiefs are 
in detention awaiting trial. 
   Many of the banks floated during the heady days of "easy money," have 
fallen foul of government's new strict regulation to sanitise the 
banking and finance industry.

Zimbabwe and Ethiopia
Case Involving Mengistu Put Off

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - A Harare regional magistrate said Friday that the 
man charged with trying to kill former Ethiopian strongman Mengistu 
Haile Mariam would have to stand in court, even without a defence lawyer 
because his trial had been repeatedly postponed. 
   Regional Magistrate William Cutler told Abraham Kinfe, 35, that his 
case was dragging for too long. Kinfe was charged in November 1995 on 
two counts of conspiracy to attempted murder and of illegal possession 
of arms of war, Kinfe, who is still looking for a lawyer to defend him, 
was remanded in custody to February 2. 
   Kinfe, an Ethiopian, wanted to assassinate Col Mengistu to revenge 
the alleged killing hundreds of people during his rule. There was tight 
security within and outside the court, with an armed policeman sitting 
inside. 
   Kinfe said his interpreter was not translating accurately what the 
magistrate was saying. 
   The trial was postponed for seven days in November 1995 after an 
application by Kinfe's lawyer, Tinofara Hove of T.K. Hove and Partners, 
that his client needed medical examination. 
   The trial was again postponed after another application in which Hove 
said there were outstanding issues which needed redress. In both cases 
the regional magistrate granted the applications with some reluctance.

Nigeria
86 Foreigners Deported Over Alleged Fraud

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigerian immigration authorities deported at least 
86 foreigners suspected of financial fraud in 1995, officials said 
Friday. 
   Immigration Spokesman Bayo Afolabi said 112 Nigerians were also 
denied foreign trips during the same period, over alleged dubious 
practices including possession of forged passports. 
   The new director of the immigration service, Sahabi Dange, spoke 
recently of an intensified drive to help curb the advance fee financial 
scam known as locally as "419." Nigerian and foreign businessmen have 
fallen victim of the practice, which has brought international disrepute 
to the already politically troubled West African country. 
   However, Nigerian officials say it normally takes the citizens and 
their foreign collaborators to commit the crime. Officials have urged 
diplomatic missions in Nigeria to advise their nationals to follow 
appropriate procedure when doing business in Nigeria. Immigration 
officials also say some citizens of other African countries of forging 
Nigerian passports for the commission of crimes, for which Nigerians are 
being blamed. It is not clear from which African countries there 
criminals are from.

Zimbabwe
Foreigners To Invest More

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Foreign investors pumped in over 1.1 billion 
Zimdollars (about 122 million USD) between June 1993 and December 1995 
following government decision to open up the Zimbabwe Stock exchange to 
foreign investors. 
   Total foreign purchases since June 23 1993 totalled 2.15 billion ZD 
(239 million USD), while the net inflow was about 1.119 billion ZD (124 
million USD), market analysts said on Friday. Quincor Stockbrokers said 
in their January bulletin the stock market, once dubbed the world's 
worst performer in 1992/93, had recovered during the past three years 
and was last year ranked third best performing stocks in emerging 
markets by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). "Over the past 
12 months, the market has had its ups and downs. 
   In general, the mining index moved in sympathy with the industrial 
index. The first three months of 1995 were bad for Zimbabwean equities, 
but both sectors rallied from intra-year lows in march to reach all-time 
record levels in October," the company said. 
   However, the market was in 1995 affected by a rash of poor results 
released by quoted companies, particularly during the last quarter of 
the year, which showed the negative effects of the 1994/95 drought, 
Quincor said. "The last batch of poor results and announcements 
depressed sentiment, but none were a surprise to the market. 
   Overall, the market is looking fairly valued on the prospect of 
reasonable rains," it said. Quincor predicted the market will this year 
benefit from a good rainy season, which would see the key industrial 
index breaching the 4,800 level for the first time. 
   Meanwhile, the industrial index on Friday reached an all-time high of 
4,257, having gained 24 points on the back of active trading during the 
morning. Minings, however, remained unchanged with reasonable turnover 
in key counters. 
   The index close nine points up at 1,341.43 points.

Lesotho
King Moshoeshoe II Buried

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   MASERU, Lesotho - Several leaders from Southern Africa joined 
thousands of mourners Friday in paying their last respects to King 
Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho who was buried Friday. 
   The King was buried at the national mountaintop shrine of Thava 
Bosiu, outside the capital Maseru, at a ceremony attended by presidents 
Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Frederick 
Chiluba of Zambia and Sir Khetumile Masire of Botswana. 
   Masire, who spoke on behalf of the other leaders, described King 
Moshoeshoe as "an illustrious son of Africa", adding: "The whole of 
Africa, as well as the world at large, have suffered an enormous loss." 
   King Moshoeshoe, 57, and his driver were killed when his car went off 
a Maluti mountain road January 15 early in the morning. The vehicle 
rolled down the mountain for about 500 metres before coming to a halt. 
He had gone to inspect his cattle posts. 
   Pathologists who examined the King said he suffered multiple rib and 
head fractures. A member of the royal family dismissed rumours that the 
King Noshoeshoe had died because of foul play. "The royal family is 
satisfied that his majesty left to join his ancestors because his time 
had come. Any claims and counter-claims and questions are, therefore, 
not true," said Chief Masupha Seeiso, the King's brother. 
   King Moshoeshoe was a constitutional monarch who wielded no legal 
powers. He was enthroned in 1960, succeeding Queen Regent Mansebo 
Seeiso. He was dethroned in 1990 after a coup d'etat by Maj. Gen. 
Justine Lekhanya and replaced by his son, King Letsie III, under the 
orders of the military. 
   In turn, King Letsie staged a royal coup in 1994, ousting the 
government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle and immediately suspending 
the constitution. However, the action received international 
condemnation and the coup was reversed in less than a month following 
the intervention of the leaders of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. 
   Letsie, however, only abdicated after promises that his father would 
be reinstated. 
   King Moshoeshoe returned from exile in Britain in 1993 when the 
military ruler at the time, Maj. Gen. Elias Ramaema surrendered 
government to civilian rulers. King Moshoeshoe regained his throne on 
January 25 1995. 
   Crown Prince David Mohato Bereng Seeiso, 32, [King Letsie III] is 
expected to succeed his father at a date to be announced.

Comoros
President Djohar Returns To Moroni

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - President Siad Mohamed Djohar returned to 
Moroni Friday, accompanied by a delegation of the Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU), according to a statement released by the 
continental body on the same day in Addis Ababa. 
   The return of the Comorian leader after several months in "forced 
exile" in the island of Reunion followed an agreement reached earlier 
this week between the country's political parties at a conference held 
in Madagascar under the auspices of the OAU. 
   He was taken to the island by French troops who put and end to a 
military take over of the Moroni government by mercenaries headed by Bod 
Denard in September 1995. 
   "Djohar and the OAU delegation headed by Assistant Secretary General 
Vijay S. Makhan, were welcomed on arrival in Moroni by Prime Minister 
Caabi El Yachroutu of the national unity government of Comoros and 
members of his government," the release said. 
   The OAU brokered an agreement with the Comorian parties at meetings 
held in Antananarivo on January 21 and 22, which provides for the 
holding of free and fair elections on March 6 and 16, under the 
supervision of the OAU and the United Nations. The OAU delegation 
currently in Moroni will hold a preliminary meeting of the follow-up 
committee with participants of the Antananarivo conference. 
   It will also be attended by observers from the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and France who are currently in Moroni. 
"This Committee which is provided for in the Antananarivo agreement is 
responsible for the implementation of the clauses of the agreement", the 
OAU statement said.

Nigeria and Gambia
Bilateral Pact To Set Up Youth Scheme

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria is helping Gambia set up its youth service 
scheme under a new bilateral pact, officials said Friday in Abuja. 
   Six senior officials of Nigeria's National Youth Service Corps, set 
up in 1973, have been seconded to Banjul on the programme based on a 
1994 request by the Gambia, the officials said. A director of Nigeria's 
corps, Grey Anegwea, now assumes that position of the Gambian Youth 
Service Scheme, which started last week. 
   Nigeria's corps, under which fresh university graduates serve one 
year in parts of the country other than their own, is designed to 
promote national unity and integration in the country of 100 million 
people with diverse ethnic groups. About 500,000 people have passed 
through the programme, launched under by former military ruler Gen. 
Yakubu Gowon, after Nigeria's civil war that ended in 1970. 
   Nigerian Youth Service Corps officials say the first intake of the 
Gambian service is expected to be mobilised at the end of the 1995/96 
academic year. The director-general of Nigeria's service, Col. Soyemi 
Sofolufe, says Nigeria is prepared to assist other African countries 
that have an interest in setting up a similar programme.

Liberia and United States
U.S. Envoy Commends African Peace Force

Panafrican News Agency
January 26, 1996 (19960126)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent

   UNITED NATIONS - United States Ambassador to the United Nations 
Madeleine Albright has called on the international community to support 
the African Peace Monitoring Group in Liberia, or ECOMOG, in its efforts 
to end years of civil war. 
   Speaking at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Liberia Thursday, 
Albright commended the force and its field commander, Brig. Gen. John 
Inienger of Nigeria, for his determination to carry out its mandate. 
   "Overall, at least for now, I found Ecomog performing well," she 
said. "They seem to be playing a neutral and constructive role now, as 
opposed to various times in the past." 
   ECOMOG was sent to Monrovia in 1990 by the 16-nation Economic 
Community of West African States (Ecowas). The peacekeepers were shelled 
on their ships in their first attempt to come ashore. The force was 
enlarged at one stage to include troops from the East African states of 
Tanzania and Uganda. They withdrew due to a delay in the peace process. 
   Albright said, "despite Ecomog's losses in recent weeks, I was 
impressed by Gen. Inienger's resolve to move forward in the face of 
adversity." 
   She added, "We [the U.S.] believe Ecomog deserves our support." 
However, she said that Ecomog's force structure should be more 
diversified among member states of the region if it is to constitute an 
authentic regional peacekeeping operation worthy of international 
support. "We also believe that Ecomog must enter into a status of forces 
agreement with the Liberian National Transitional Government so that 
Ecomog's operations in Liberia are appropriately regulated," she said. 
The deployment of Ecomog across Liberia in December 1995 was made 
possible by the 10-million-dollar pledge by the U.S. to assist the force 
logistically. "
   The vehicles Ecomog desperately needs to facilitate disarmament and 
demobilisation have begun to arrive under the 10-million-dollar pledge," 
she said, and said other countries should help. Nigeria has the largest 
contingent in Ecomog. The force, along with the U.N. Observer Mission in 
Liberia is expected to monitor the implementation of the Abuja 
Agreement, signed by the Liberian warring factions in August. 
   The agreement is widely seen as a last-ditch effort to end the six-
year civil war, which has claimed 150,000 lives and sent half of the 
country's 2.5 million people to seek refuge in other countries.

Zambia and Rwanda
Trial Preparations for Genocide Suspects

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent
 
   LUSAKA, Zambia -  The Rwandese government has trained more than 300 
magistrates, prosecutors and other court staff to help try suspected 
perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in that country.
   Rwanda Foreign Minister Anastase Gazana said in Lusaka Wednesday that 
his government will try some of the genocide suspects under a United 
Nations mandate which in 1995 set up the Rwanda International Genocide 
Tribunal to bring the culprits to book.
   He said that under the tribunal's terms of reference governments, 
including Rwanda itself, had the powers to try anybody suspected of 
involvement in the genocide in which an estimated 1,000,000 Rwandese 
died and millions of others forced to flee for safety.
   Gazana arrived in Lusaka Tuesday to brief Zambian government 
officials about the identity of some of the suspected authors of the 
genocide who are believed to be hiding in Zambia.
   A team of experts have arrived in Arusha, Tanzania, to prepare for 
the trials by the tribunal chaired by South African Judge Richard 
Goldstone.
   The tribunal is expected to start hearing evidence by March, 
according to Gazana.
   Rwanda has appealed to the international community to turn over to 
the tribunal any suspects who might have taken refuge in foreign 
countries.
   Gazana Wednesday handed the Zambian government a list of some 500 
suspects including former Justice Minister Agnes Ntamabyaliro who is 
suspected to be in Zambia.
   Lusaka said it detained some suspected Rwandese fugitives who would 
be handed over to the tribunal.
   Gazana said his government was not particularly interested in 
securing death sentences for the suspects but that it was necessary that 
"justice" was done.
   "We are not particularly looking for death for the perpetrators (of 
the genocide), we want justice to be done in order to reconcile those 
who had been wronged".
   Victims of the genocide were mainly people of the minority Tutsi 
ethnic group and some liberal majority Hutus.
   Gazana said the Kigali government recommended that foreign 
governments who imprisoned any of the genocide suspects should ensure 
that they were excluded from prerogatives of mercy so that they could 
serve the full terms according to international law on genocide.
   Gazana who was accompanied by Zambian Justice Minister Mukabenzi 
Marthe returns to Kigali Thursday.
   He has undertaken similar missions to several other African countries 
seeking to have suspects repatriated and handed over either to the 
tribunal in Tanzania or to his government.

Rwanda
Government Calls for International Support to Rebuild

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent
  
   LUSAKA, Zambia - Nearly two years after at least one million of its 
people were massacred in an organized genocide, Rwanda is appealing to 
African and other states to support her national reconstruction and 
rehabilitation efforts.
   The appeal is contained in Kigali's foreign ministry memorandum 
entitled "The General Situation in Rwanda" after the genocide.
   The document urges the international community to pledge to take 
joint concrete actions to advance peace, justice, reconciliation, 
stability and development in Rwanda and the rest of the Great Lakes 
Region.
   " All the nations must be determined to prevent future genocide, 
ensure reconciliation with justice relating to the tragic genocide and 
massacres in Rwanda in 1994 and encourage the return of refugees to 
their home-countries," said the memorandum.
   The memorandum was issued to PANA late Wednesday by visiting Rwandan 
Foreign Minister, Anastase Gasana.
   It said that among the specific actions the world community could 
undertake to assist in rebuilding the country included mobilization of 
financial resources for social and economic rehabilitation.
   Rwanda also called for the acceleration of the international 
tribunal's effort to try genocide suspects and urged all concerned 
governments to hand over suspects to the international court. 
Deliberations are expected to start next March in Arusha, northern 
Tanzanian.
   A conference in Kigali last November on the "Genocide, impunity and 
accountability: A dialogue for national and international response" 
recommended that the rehabilitation process in Rwanda should include 
reconstituting the moral, physical, socio-economic and psychological 
values of the survivors of the genocide.
   Kigali has set restoration of education, justice, agriculture, health 
and repatriation of refugees as among the priorities in the national 
reconstruction and rehabilitation process.
   Rwanda also recommended to the international community to set up a 
genocide compensation fund for the genocide victims.
   The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) government estimates that 1.5 
million of the two million refugees who fled to neighboring Burundi, 
Tanzania and Zaire have returned to the country and were currently being 
rehabilitated.
   But reports from the Burundi-Tanzania border indicate an outflow of 
Rwandan Hutu refugees from Burundi to escape attacks from Bujumbura's 
Tutsi-dominated army.
   The Hutu refugees fled into exile fearing reprisals from the mostly 
Tutsi RPF, which took power in Kigali in July 1994.
   The RPF, mainly composed of sons of Uganda-based Tutsi exiles, had 
been fighting the army of the late Rwandan President, Juvenal 
Habyarimana, since Oct. 1, 1990.

Nigeria
Population Hits 100 Million

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - The population of Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
state, has hit the 100 million mark, the country's National Population 
Commission has said.
   A 1991 census by the commission put the country's population at 88.5 
million with annual growth estimate of 2.83 percent.
   Commission's spokesman Ahmed Hameed told journalists in Lagos that 
based on the growth rate Nigeria's population had reached 100 million by 
December 1995.
   The World Bank and several United Nations agencies estimate the 
country's population at more than 100 million.
   The 1991 figure stirred much controversy, with some states claiming 
they had been under-counted.
   The commission has, however, said the protests could not invalidate 
the census, Nigeria's first in almost 20 years.
   Censuses are a sensitive subject in Nigeria, a politically polarised 
federation of diverse ethnic groups.
   Groups said to have larger populations often demand a greater share 
of the national cake.
   Hameed said the population commision plans another head count in 
2001, adding that at least three years of preparation would be needed to 
ensure reliable data is obtained.

Liberia
Boutros-Ghali Urges Extension of UN Mission

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent
 
   UNITED NATIONS, New York - United Nations Secretary-General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali has asked the Security Council to extend the mandate of 
the United Nations mission in Liberia for four months, despite the 
setback in the peace process caused by recent fighting in parts of the 
country.
   In his latest report to the council on the U.N. Observer Mission in 
Liberia (UNOMIL), he recommended that the mandate, which expires at the 
end of this month, be extended until May 31.
   The UN chief said "during this period, I expect the LTG (Liberian 
National Transitional Government) and faction leaders to provide their 
full cooperation to ECOMOG and UNOMIL in stabilizing the situation and 
in vigorously moving ahead with the implementation of the Abuja 
agreement."
   He also called on the international community to reconsider urgently 
its current level of support to the Ecowas Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to 
enable it to carry out its responsibilities under the agreement.
   Boutros-Ghali described as a setback the recent fighting in 
Tubmanburg and the delay in implementing key aspects of the Abuja 
agreement, signed in the Nigerian capital Aug. 19, 1995.
   He said the "peace process suffered a setback when Gen. Roosevelt 
Johnson's wing of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for 
Democracy (ULIMO-J) attacked ECOMOG in Tubmanburg on Dec. 28 1995."
   Under the schedule of implementation of the agreement, the 
disengagement of forces was to have been completed by Sept. 26 while 
disarmament was to have started Dec. 1.
   Boutros-Ghali said "the peace process is now at a critical juncture 
and the full support of all concerned will be required to overcome the 
recent setbacks."
   He warned faction leaders that ECOWAS (Economic community of West 
African States) and the international community could not support the 
Liberian peace process indefinitely.
   Meanwhile, the UN chief has announced his intention to appoint a 
senior electoral officer to follow, on a full-time basis, the 
preparatory phases of the electoral process in Liberia.
   He said he would also send a technical mission to Liberia to consult 
with the LNTG and ECOWAS, among others, in drafting a framework for the 
observation and verification of the electoral process.
   Under the Abuja accord, legislative and presidential elections are 
scheduled for Aug. 20, 1996.
   The agreement is widely regarded as the most-promising effort to end 
the six-year fighting in Liberia, which has claimed 150,000 lives and 
displaced a large percentage of the country's 2.5 million people.

Benin
Airline Has Financial Woes

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Ali Idrissou, PANA Correspondent
   
   COTONOU, Benin - Air Afrique's board of governors holds its 87th 
session Thursday and Friday in Cotonou against a background of financial 
trouble at the airline.
   The company is trying to raise 5.8 billion cfa, out of some 15 
billion cfa (1 U.S. dollar = about 500 cfa), needed in new investment.
   Sources close to the airline said France already had given the 
company, in which it is a major partner, 9.2 billion cfa in new 
financing.
   Air Afrique in December disclosed it was in urgent need of new cash 
to sustain operations. Most of the money will go toward paying for four 
planes bought between 1991 and 1994.
   The company has serious cash flow problems. Member states owe it some 
four billion cfa in unpaid flight tickets. Air Afrique's own debt is 
estimated at at 200 billion cfa.
   According to the same sources, French and American experts have urged 
a radical restructuring of the company, including a "long term 
privatization of the company, with gradual state disengagement."
   The changes are centered on cutting costs and making operations more 
efficient.
   Foreign shareholders -- Air France, the French Development Fund, the 
West African Development Bank and DHL -- have a 49 percent of stake in 
Air Afrique.
   Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Congo, Central African Republic, Ivory 
Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Togo own 51 
percent of the company.

Soccer: Algeria's Desert Warriors In Quarter-Finals

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Randy Zormelo,PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Striker Khaled Louncini led Algeria to 
a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso in a Group 'B' clash in Port Elizabeth 
Wednesday, qualifying his side for the quarter finals of the 20th 
African Cup of Nations in South Africa.
   Louncini rocked Burkina in the second minute with a lethal header off 
a left-footed cross from Sidi Ahmed Zerrouki.
   The 'Stallions'  bounced back five minutes later but missed the 
target as Aboubabcary's close range shot went screaming centimetres over 
the bar. Half time score was 1-0 againt the stallions.
   The Burkinabe's, rejuvinated by changes at the beginning of the 
second half, dominated proceedings, making several assaults towards the 
Algerian goal.
   But Algeria struck again in the 76th minute when Louncini put 
midfielder Moussa Saib through to score the second goal.
   The Stallions of Ouagadougou pulled one back when striker Boureima 
Zonga slotted in a header off a cross from Ibrahima Traore.
   Meanwhile Zambia made mincemeat of Sierra Leone with a 4-0 drabbing 
in a wet Group 'B' match played Wednesday in Bloemfontein.
   The 1994 vice-champions were in great form with skipper Kalusha 
Bwalya scoring a hat-trick (2nd, 9th and 84th minutes). Midfielder Modon 
Malitoli completed the rout in the 88th minute.
   In Durban on the same day Angola held Cameroon to 3-3 draw in the 
Group A match. But the two sides are out of the competition.
   In the earlier Group A match played in Johannesburg Egypt upset 
hosts, South Africa, 1-0. But the victory margin was not enough to 
topple South Africa from its perch in the group. The Pharaohs are 
runner-up.
   Quarter final line-up: South Africa vs Algeria; (Johannesburg) Zambia 
vs Egypt (Bloemfontein). The other four quarter finals pairs will be 
decided after Thursday's matches.

Sierra Leone  
Rebels Declare Unilateral Cease-fire 

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
      
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United 
Front declared a one-week unconditional cease-fire in its four-year war 
in the West African country. 
   RUF spokesman Fayia Musa said in an interview broadcast late Tuesday 
that the move was in response to the peace offer from Sierra Leone's new 
military rulers. 
   He said the group ordered its units to stop "all the ambushes and 
fighting" immediately. 
   This is not the first cease-fire in the civil war, which has defied 
several peace moves including the one initiated by the Organization of 
African Unity. 
   Musa said the latest RUF offer is to allow humanitarian relief reach 
civilians in the rebel-controlled area. 
   Sierra Leone's new military ruler, Brig. Julius Maada Bio, in one of 
his initial gestures since assuming power after the bloodless coup Jan. 
16, invited the RUF to negotiate to end the war and the country's 
polititcal crisis. 
   Bio also promised amnesty for the rebels and renewed his commitment 
to democracy, saying the Feb. 26 national elections will proceed as 
planned by the man he overthrew, Capt. Valentine Strasser. 
   Musa said the group was committed to peace, but he reiterated the 
organization's demand to postpone the national elections. 
   Diplomatic sources in Freetown say both sides were to begin 
reconciliation talks that could signal the return of peace to Sierra 
Leone. 
   The diplomats say the government could agree to the rebels' request 
and postpone the polls, if only to be seen as accommodating all 
interests in the democratic process. 
   Bio heads a 17-member military ruling council. 
   Sierra Leone, with four million people, is rich in diamonds, gold and 
other prized minerals, but the civil was has devastated its economy, 
prompting successive governments in Freetown to seek foreign military 
assistance.

Somalia
Security Council Still Committed to Peace

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent
   
   UNITED NATIONS, New York - The Security Council, which voted in 1995 
to end its mission in Somalia, pledged to remain involved in the peace 
efforts, saying it takes the situation there very seriously. 
   "We do not wish the implication to be given that somehow what is 
going on in Somalia is of no consequence to us, that Somalia has been 
abandoned," Council President John Weston of Britain said after a 
discussion of the secretary-general's latest report on Somalia. 
   He also said the council supported the efforts of the Nairobi-based 
United Nations Political Office for Somalia, which is "keeping a 
watching brief on that country." 
   Weston said the council had noted the "heroic efforts" of 
humanitarian and other agencies whose presence in Somalia was doing much 
to prevent the worst tragedies from happening in the country. 
   Weston expressed the hope the emergence of regional administration in 
various parts of Somalia would lead to "new possibilities for setting up 
a proper centralized government again in that country." 
   In the report, released on Monday, the Secretary-General said the 
current situation in Somalia was characterized by "political 
instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general lawlessness." 
   He said "the political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a 
debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction 
leaders failed to honor their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of 
March 24, 1994." 
   However, the Secretary-General noted that an all-out civil war, which 
many feared would follow the withdrawal of U.N. forces from the country, 
had been averted despite its lack of progress toward national 
reconciliation. 
   The Security Council, citing lack of progress in efforts to end the 
Somali conflict, withdrew the UN operation in Somalia in March

Africans Among Journalists Killed In 1995

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
   
   DAKAR, Senegal - Twenty-eight Africans were among 50 journalists 
killed in 1995, according to a survey conducted by Paris-based 
'Reporters Sans Frontiers'quoted by French 'Frequence Libre'newspaper 
Wednesday. 
   The paper attributed the high number of African journalists killed 
last year to the Algerian crisis and the conflict in the Great Lakes of 
Central Africa. 
   Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union followed with ten 
victims including five in Russia, two in Tadjikistan, and one each in 
Azerbaidjan, Croatia and the United Kingdom. 
   The American continents lost eight people -- four in Brazil, two in 
Colombia, one in Canada and one in Mexico. 
   The four other victims whose nationalities were not disclosed were 
killed in Asia.

Kenya
Government Urged to Drop Press Legislation

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
   
   NAIROBI, Kenya - The Union of African Journalists (UAJ) has appealed 
to the Kenyan government to drop plans to introduce press legislation. 
   The call was made Tuesday in Cairo by UAJ's President Mahfouz 
Elansary and Secretary-General George Odiko. 
   Speaking during the closure of a three-week seminar attended by 20 
African journalists, the two said the envisaged legislation would only 
help to suppress the media industry "making it less productive." 
   "There  are already enough laws in Kenya to deal with individuals and 
organizations so the union sees no good reason for the country to 
introduce more restrictions on the press," Odiko said. 
   The two union leaders said the proposed laws were intended to create 
fear among individuals wishing to establish independent broadcasting 
stations and media publishing houses. 
   Elansary said if the bills are passed in parliament, Kenya risked 
joining the list of countries that had muzzled the press. 
   Meanwhile, the Association of Free and Independent Press (AFIP) has 
asked Kenya's attorney-general to withdraw the draft bills saying they 
were a betrayal of his commitment to the democratization process. 
   Recently, the attorney-general published the draft 'Kenya Press 
Council Bill'which, if passed, will lead to the creation of a council 
charged with the registration of journalists and the massa media. 
   The government also published the 'Kenya Mass Media Commission' which 
is expected to regulate the operations of the mass media, including 
registration of newspapers and licencing of newspapers and broadcast 
media.

Senegal  
Mosquito Trap Raises Hope in Anti-Malaria Fight

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Aly Coulibaly,  PANA Correspondent
   
   DAKAR, Senegal - The French Institute for Research and Development 
Cooperation (ORSTOM) is currently experimenting with a mosquito trap to 
eradicate that malaria carrier. 
   ORSTOM entomologist Robert Vincent said the trap, fitted with a bulb, 
is similar to the one that his organization developed 20 years ago to 
catch tse-tse flies. 
   He said that a Dutch collegue, Bart Knols, has been studying for two 
years the effectiveness of the mosquito trap, which has also been tested 
in Tanzania for five years. 
   Among the study's goals is to find factors that make human blood 
attractive to mosquitoes. 
   So far, the researchers have found that people with smelly feet are 
more likely to attract mosquitoes at night, especially when it is hot. 
   "Heat is a physical attraction for the mosqitoes, especially when the 
human body attains 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The 
mosquitoes particularly like the feet," Vincent said. 
   The mosquito trap has an entrance but no exit. So when the malaria-
carrying insect enters, it can't leave. 
   Scientists hope to eradicate vast areas of mosquitoes, as was the 
case with tse-tse flies. 
   Recent World Health Organization figures indicate that from 1985 to 
1989, between 12 million and 22 million people suffered from malaria 
each year in sub-Saharan Africa.

Nigeria 
More Illegal Health Centres Closed

Panafrican News Agency
January 24, 1996 (19960124)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - The Nigerian government has closed some 15 more 
illegal private health centres in an effort to rid the country of 
quacks. 
   Last October 40 such clinics were shut in Lagos, Nigeria's business 
capital. 
   The latest closures announced Tuesday were in the midwestern state of 
Edo where, as in Lagos state, a taskforce has been set up to regularize 
private medical practice. 
   Taskforce officials say some of the affected health centres were 
unregistered, while others lacked relevant personnel and equipment. 
   The taskforce in Edo said some of the closed clinics were being run 
by medical personnel in government employment, which is illegal.

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Gold production in Zimbabwe in 1995 exceeded 24 
tons for the first time in more than five decades, the Chamber of Mines 
of Zimbabwe said on Wednesday.

1995, with notable producers such as Cluff Resources Zimbabwe Ltd and 
Falgold leading the way. 
   Cluff, whose UK-based parent recently agreed to a takeover bid by 
Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields, owns Zimbabwe's largest underground gold 
mine at Bindura, some 50 miles north of Harare, the capital.

South Africa 
New Kwazulu-Natal Peace Initiative Underway 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent
   
   PRETORIA, South Africa - A new large-scale initiative is underway to 
bring peace to South Africa's strife-torn Kwazulu-Natal province. 
   Hopes are running high here that Monday's meeting between President 
Nelson Mandela, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
and African National Congress (ANA) Chairman in Kwazulu-Natal Jacob Zuma 
has set the ball rolling for a new and meaningful initiative. 
   The three leaders agreed to push for an imbizo, a traditional-style 
gathering of the Zulu nation, as the first step in the new peace drive. 
   Mandela announced after the meeting that he would be making immediate 
contact with Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini to ask him to hold a meeting 
of Zulu traditional leaders as soon as possible to arrange for the 
holding of the imbizo. 
   Mandela and Chief Buthelezi would also atttend the meeting. 
   The South African president described the meeting of the Zulu nation 
as "a matter of urgency." He said neither the ANC nor the IFP could 
settle the matter through armed warfare. 
   "Only negotiations between the respective peoples can bring about a 
solution," Mandela added. 
   The imbizo is expected to be the largest meeting ever held as part of 
the peace process in Kwazulu-Natal. 
   Monday's meeting followed another bloody weekend in which at least 40 
people were killed in Kwazulu-Natal.

Zambia 
Donors Tie Aid to Good Governance 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent 
   
   LUSAKA, Zambia - Swedish ambassador to Zambia Anders Johnson Tuesday 
in Lusaka reiterated Western donor demands that the Movement for 
Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba 
maintain "good governance" as a condition for development aid. 
   Johnson said that Sweden considered that a succesful implementation 
of Zambia's economic and democratic reforms required "decisive, bold and 
skilful political management" and wide support of the people. 
   "To muster and maintain such support, burdens as well as benefits 
have to be shared among population groups in a reasonably balanced 
manner..." said Johnson when he signed for his country's 27 million 
dollars aid package to help Zambia's socio-economic and democratic 
reform process. 
   In a specific reference to the current wrangle between Chiluba's 
government on the one hand and the opposition and other pressure groups 
on the other on the best mode of adopting the country's draft 
constitution, Johnson said that Zambia deserved a constitution that 
could stand the test of time. 
   He also said Sweden expected the government would undertake orderly 
preparations for and implementation of the scheduled local government 
and general elections this year. 
   Johnson said that there was need to allow a "vibrant" civil society 
and a free press which he said were all vital to ensuring enhancement of 
democratic values. 
   Political analysts understood Johnson's remarks as an indirect and 
polite rebuff to Chiluba's government which has insisted on passing the 
draft constitution by a parliament it dominates. This is contrary to 
popular demands that it be submitted to a national constituent assembly. 
   The government has opposed a proposed march in the capital by civil 
society groups Friday to press for demands that the draft constitution 
be  passed by a constituent assembly. 
   Chiluba said last Friday while opening the 1996 session of his MMD-
dominated parliament that those agitating for a constituent assembly had 
"an axe to grind" with the government and that acceding to their demands 
would be tantamount to resorting to "jungle law" in the managment of 
national affairs. 
   Critics of Chiluba's stand on the adoption of the constitution have 
charged that the president intends to "hijack" the constitution by 
getting MMD members of parliament to pass controversial clauses in his 
favor. 
   The MMD has recommended in the constitution that only second-
generation Zambians should contest the republican presidency. 
   This has been widely condemned as an attempt to bar former president 
Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents, from the polls. Kaunda plans 
to challenge Chiluba for the presidency. 
   Some sources supporting the government recently accused Kaunda of 
prevailing on the donor community to deny Chiluba aid if he insisted on 
maligning political opponents. 
   The Paris Club donor community which last December granted Zambia 
some 800 million dollars in aid said the funds would be disbursed only 
if the community were satisfied there was a commitment to "good 
governance" on the part of Chiluba's government, among other conditions.

United Nations and Somalia 
Boutros-Ghali Decries Political Stalemate

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Segun Adeyemi, PANA Correspondent  
   
   UNITED NATIONS - An all-out civil war, which many feared would follow 
the withdrawal of the United Nations forces from Somalia, has so far 
been averted but the country remains volatile, UN secretary-general 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said. 
   He said the situation in the country has been characterized by 
"political instability, inter-clan conflict, banditry and general 
lawlessness." 
   "The political situation in Somalia has been dominated by a 
debilitating stalemate for almost two years since the Somali faction 
leaders failed to honour their commitments in the Nairobi declaration of 
24 March 1994," Boutros-Ghali said in his latest report on the country. 
   He said the stalemate had caused political leaders to focus on the 
development of regional administrative structures and a peaceful climate 
in their regions. 
   "It is unclear at this point whether such regional authorities will 
be formed in most of the regions in Somalia," he said, adding that a 
central governing authority was urgently needed to take charge of the 
country. 
   Boutros-Ghali said some Somali leaders believe serious progress 
toward national reconciliation would only be possible if Gen. Mohammed 
Farah Aidid of the Somali National Alliance withdraws from Baidoa, which 
he captured Sept. 17. 
   The warlord should also to rescind his "unilateral proclamation of 
himself as 'president' of Somalia." 
   "Durable peace cannot be achieved in Somalia without a process of 
sufficiently broad-based consultations among the Somalis themselves," 
Boutros-Ghali said. 
   He said the U.N. security council might wish to reiterate its call 
for Somali parties to adopt this approach. 
   The secretary-general promised he would continue to maintain the 
Nairobi-based U.N. political office for Somalia so that it could 
continue its efforts to maintain and expand contacts with all Somali 
parties. 
   On the humanitarian front, he said the most urgent needs were food 
and essential health systems support, particularly immunization and 
measures to control the spread of epidemic diseases such as cholera. 
   "The low level of food production, continued political instability 
and other factors combine to make international assistance to somalia 
essential," he said. 
   He said U.N. agencies would continue their current programs in the 
country. 
   The U.N. Security Council, citing lack of progress in the Somali 
peace process, pulled its multi-national forces out of the country on 
March 31, 1994.

South Africa
Future Of Government of National Unity Uncertain

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Lionel Williams, PANA Correspondent
   
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa - South African President Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress (ANC) has said it is opposed to the 
continuation of a government of national unity after 1999. 
   The ANC said Tuesdays such a government would become an obstacle to 
multi-party democracy if it became a permanent feature. 
   The ANC was reacting to the weekend call by National Party leader and 
Deputy President F.W. de Klerk for the continuation of governement of 
national unity after the 1999 general election. 
   The ANC statement said the government of national unity had been 
conceived as a necessary element in  South Africa's transition from 
apartheid to democracy. It had served the country well, paving the way 
for smooth political transition and laying the foundation for 
reconciliation. 
   But, said the ANC, multi-party democracy needed various political 
parties representing different political persuasions. While inter-party 
cooperation was a positive element, a forced coalition denied the 
majority political party the right to decide freely on how to pursue the 
best interests of the majority of the people.

Zimbabwe 
Tall Tales of A Failed Joint Venture 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Tawona Tavengwa. PANA Correspondent
   
   KADOMA, Zimbabwe - A casual visitor to the giant National Glass 
Company plant in the Central Zimbabwean town of Kadoma would think that 
the noise coming from within is that of production machines in full 
swing. 
   That certainly is not the case. The noise is only that of local 
maintenance workers servicing the plant and oiling the wheels while 
awaiting the international chamber of commerce (ICC) in Paris, France, 
to decide the fate of the 70-million-Zimdollar (7.8 million-U.S.dollar) 
plant. 
   The factory is at the centre of a legal wrangle between the 
government of Zimbabwe through its investment arm, the Industrial 
Development Corporation (IDC), and its partner in the failed glass 
production joint venture, Romania's ROMSIT. 
   The company, hailed as the first undertaking of its kind in the 12-
nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), was commissioned 
in 1990 by President Robert Mugabe amid much publicity. 
   Soon after that, it began facing serious financial and operational 
problems which led to its closure in 1993. 
   Most of these handicaps were centred around the production of 
unusable sheet glass which occurred for several months in succession. 
   When the local construction industry rejected the glass, the company 
stopped production and switched over to marketing imported Chinese 
glass. 
   This was meant to be a temporary move aimed at meeting the basic 
overheads while solutions to its problems were being sought. But it was 
a short-lived effort. 
   During the 1992/93 financial year National Glass incurred a loss of 
41.4 million Zimdollars (4.6 million U.S. dollars) up from 19.4 million 
Zimdollars (2.2 million U.S. dollars) the previous year. 
   When the Zimbabwe government asked the Romanians to finance repair 
costs of the plant and to write off some loans, they refused. 
   This refusal sparked a wrangle which was taken to the Paris-based ICC 
in 1994 for arbitration. 
   The manner in which the IDC and ROMSIT now regard each other is a 
direct contrast to the warm and open relationship which characterized 
the early days of the venture. 
   During the early stages, 30 Zimbabweans were sent to Romania for 
specialized training in glass making. 
   Romanian consultants also came to the country in large numbers in an 
effort to transfer their expertise in glass making to locals. 
   All in all, the company employed about 180 locals and it was expected 
to produce 13,000 tons of glass sheet every year when local demand for 
such glass at the time was just between 8,000 and 9,000 tons. 
   This left a reasonable amount for export to SADC states, most of 
which were, like Zimbabwe, very excited about the venture. 
   "This represents typical technology transfer from Romania to 
Zimbabwe. We have many friends around the world who give us fish, but 
they do not want to teach us how to catch the fish. You have taught us 
how to catch the fish. We are very grateful," said Kumbirai Kangai, then 
minister of industry and commerce. 
   Today, government and IDC officials do not want to say much about the 
plant or the impending case for fear that any ill-advised statements may 
get to the ears of the Romanians, who will then use them in court when 
the Paris hearings finally commence. 
   In the meantime, a small staff of six remains at the plant, working 
as facilitators to the IDC's legal team in Paris. 
   Guards at the place confirmed that at one point just after the 
plant's closure, their services were terminated, leaving the place 
vulnerable to thieves. 
   Vital machine components were stolen during this period, prompting 
IDC management to order the re-engangement of the guards. 
   The joint venture's other major investments included a housing estate 
in Kadoma which consisted mainly of garden flats which were meant for 
its workers. 
   The sprawling estate, although now leased to a real estate agent, is 
also rotting like the glass plant, with signs of neglect all over. 
   Until the case is resolved, the houses will likely remain as they 
are, uncared for. 
   Meanwhile, the company, though long closed with very little prospects 
of ever being re-opened, still owes several companies, including the 
local authority about 1.3 million Zimdollars (144,440 U.S.dollars). 
   The authority recently took the matter to its lawyers and another 
legal wrangle might soon be in the local courts, an action that may 
jeopardize efforts to settle the original case in Paris.

Kenya Dominates East African Tea Market 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
   
   NAIROBI, Kenya - The amount of tea offered at the Mombasa auction 
registered a 17-percent increase in 1995 to reach 173.7 million 
kilograms (382.14 million pounds). 
   According to the annual tea purchases report issued by the Africa Tea 
Brokers Limited, the amount was 25.7 million kilograms (56.54 million 
pounds) higher than the 148 million kilograms (325.6 million pounds) 
kilograms sold by the action in 1994. 
   The report shows that Lipton Limited topped the list of buyers with 
purchases of 27.8 million kilograms (61.16 million pounds) followed 
closely by Vanrees limited with 20.9 million kilograms (45.98 million 
pounds). 
   Kenya continued to dominate the Mombasa auction with 155.3 million 
kilograms (341.66 million pounds) of tea sold last year. Uganda folowed 
with 8.6 million kilograms (18.92 million pounds) and Tanzania with 6.52 
million kilograms (143.44 million pounds). 
   For Uganda, this represented a two-percent drop from the 1994 figures 
and seven percent for Tanzania. Brokers were not able to establish 
reasons for the drop for both countries. 
   War-torn Rwanda which performed poorly in the 1994 season 
surprisingly recorded a 566-per-cent increase with 733,084 kilograms 
(1612.88 pounds) offered, an indication that farmers in the country were 
back to work after the bloody ethnic violence rocked the country in 1993 
and 1994. 
   Neighboring Burundi also afflicted with ethnic violence, recorded a 
37-per-cent increase with 1.7 million kilograms (3.74 million pounds) up 
from 624,000 kilograms (1,372,800 pounds) in 1994. 
   The sharpest drop of 94 percent was recorded by Malawi. 
   During last week's tea auction in Mombasa, Egypt and Pakistan 
registered strong interest in Kenyan tea joining traditional buyers such 
as United Kingdom. Sudan, Yemen and the Middle East nations are also 
showing interest in the auction. 
   But the prices of tea in the international market have been low due 
to a glut. 
   Tea is also facing stiff competition from soft drinks and other 
beverages forcing products to seek new strategies for promoting tea 
drinking.

Nigeria 
Highway Toll Commercialized

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's military government has raised fees 
payable by motorists using federal highways and contracted 25 companies 
to handle the toll collection as part of privatization of inefficient 
government agencies. 
   Works and housing minister Brig.Gen. Abdulkarim Adisa said in Lagos 
Monday the 100 percent increase covering the nation's 28 toll plazas 
comes into effect Feb. 1. 
   Trucks and luxury buses pay 50 naira as against 25 naira previously, 
while smaller vehicles have had their fee reduced from 10 to five naira 
(85 naira = 1 U.S. dollar). 
   The minister said the privatization was aimed at stemming "the high 
level" fraud that had characterized toll collection since 1978. 
   The ministry also hopes to draw on the efficiency of the private 
sector in toll collection, he added. 
   Only vehicles belonging to the armed forces, the police, road safety 
corps and other force services are exempt from paying toll. 
   However, Adisa stressed "it must be borne in mind that govenment 
remains the owner of all toll plazas and will continue to regulate and 
control their operation in order to maintain a healthy balance between 
the interest of the contractor operators and the public. 
   Until now, some govenrment workers regarded deployment to tollgates 
as a source of self-enrichment.

Soccer: Tunisian Barred For Vulgar Language 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Randy Zormelo, PANA Staff Correspondent
   
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa - Tunisian Football Association Chairman 
Nasser Benhassine was barred Monday from the touchline and changing 
rooms for using foul language as a referee at the African Cup of Nations 
games taking place in South Africa. 
   Benhassine will therefore match the final Groupe D match between 
Tunisia and Ivory Coast Thursday from the enclosed private suite of the 
Boet Erasmus Stadium in Port Elizabeth. 
   He is accusecd of directing "vulgar and offensive" remarks at both 
the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and South African referee 
Petros Mathabela. 
   The incident occurred during the Ghana-Tunisia clash last Thursday 
when Benhassine lost his temper because of some decision taken by 
Mathabela in the match won 2-1 by Ghana. 
   Benhassine, who heads the Tunisian delegation to the tournament, 
later apologized for his outburt but insisted he was right in objecting. 
   "I am sure the referee's mistakes were unintentional and I am sorry 
about the comments. But at least on two occasions, he should have given 
us a penalty for foul play and he didn't", Benhassine told journalists. 
   He denied having sworn at Mathaebla or CAF officials. 
   "I did not swear at any stage. I told the referee that it was a shame 
he had officiated the game so badly," Benhassine said. 
   "And I told CAF officials that I thought they had a duty to respect 
nations and appoint referees who are capable of handling important 
matches such as these. I still can't understand why they appointed him," 
he said. 
   Journalists covering the matches in Port Elizabeth have criticized 
the poor officiating by referees. 
   Benhassine is the first official to be barred from the touchline 
since the tournament kicked of Jan. 13.

Soccer: Burkina Faso Fires Coach 

Panafrican News Agency
January 25, 1996 (19960125)
by Victor Tsuai, PANA Correspondent
   
   JOHANNESBURG - Burkina Faso has fired its coach for being 
outmaneuvered at the current African Cup of Nations soccer finals being 
played in South Africa. 
   Idrissa Traore's sacking came shortly before Burkina Faso's all-
important game against Algeria Wednesday. 
   Traore, axed for what the Burkinabe administration termed "poor 
results the team has achieved and bad placement of the players", was 
immediately replaced by his assistant, Calixte Zagre. 
   Burkina Faso made the announcement shortly before their departure 
from Bloemfontein for Port Elizabeth where they take on Algeria in a do 
or die battle at the Boet Erasumus Stadium on Wednesday. 
   The suspension was announced by Burkina Faso's Football Association 
General-Secretary Ferdinand Nikiema. 
   Sources within the Burkinabe team disclosed Traore and Kikiema had 
not seen eye to eye since their team arrived in South Africa on Jan. 9. 
   The relationship between the two soured more when Burkina Faso lost 
their opening game 2-1 against Sierra Leone and went on to receive a 
deflating 5-1 drubbing at the hands of Zambia. 
   Burkina Faso, however, are expected to pack their bags and leave the 
country after their game against Algeria, whether they win or lose.

Delay In Releasing Nigerian Budget Weighs Down Stock Exchange

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - The delay in releasing the 1996 budget and the 
attendant suspense is affecting activities on the Nigerian Stock 
Exchange(NSE), officials said Tuesday.
   In two weeks of trading in the new year, a total of four million 
sharesworth 15.6 million Naira were traded in 509 deals in Lagos, Ibadan 
and Kano floors of the Exchange. This marginally raised the all-shares 
index by 7.94 points to close at 5103.33 by last weekend. (85 naira = 1 
USD and 100 kobo = one naira).
   A breakdown showed that 413 deals were traded in Lagos for 3.2 
million shares valued at 14.2 million Naira compared with 299 deals for 
1.2 million shares worth 10.7 million Naira recorded on the floor the 
previous week.
   Turnover in Ibadan stood at 400,000 shares valued at 7.8 million 
Naira in 76 deals, as against 23 deals for 21,511 shares worth 300,000 
Naira recorded in the previous week.
   The Kano floor traded 400,000 shares worth 6.4 million Naira in 20 
deals compared with a previous 96,094 shares worth 1.2 million Naira in 
22 deals.
   On the Lagos floor, the second-tier securities market with a market 
capitalisation of 900,000 Naira from 1.2 million shares in 3 deals 
recorded the highest trading in volume terms.
   The banking sub-sector followed with a turnover of 800,000 shares 
worth 2.4 million Naira in 48 deals.
   In the over-all equity price movement, the bullish trading in the 
petroleum products marketing sector culminated in a "landmark price" 
recorded byFrench oil conglomerate, TOTAL. Its unit share, which opened 
at 29.78 Naira closed at 30 Naira, a historic high in the 33 years of 
the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
   Brokers hailed the development as a measure of confidence in the 
official deregulation policy.
   Some 34 other securities in the equities sector also recorded gains 
at th estock market ranging between 1 kobo and 23 kobo, while John Holt 
lost 30 kobo due to price adjustment for dividend payment.
   In Nigeria, the government usually announced the national budget on 
January 1. This was delayed in 1995 and officials say the 1996 estimates 
are not ready.
   Industrialists are not happy with the delay saying it slows down 
economic activity

Zimbabwe Expects Boom In Tobacco Prices

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Tobacco prices at this year's auctions are 
expected to be higher compared to those paid in 1995 amid indications 
the Zimbabwean crop is in demand from both local and overseas buyers, 
growers said.
   In an interview last week, Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) Vice-
President Rob Webb said prices had been on the upward trend since 
1992/93, when theyfell drastically due to over-production in the major 
growing countries.
   "The ZTA's position is that we should see an increase in prices 
compared with those achieved in the 1994/95 season considering that 
world stocks hav ebalanced and demand for our crop is high," Webb said.
   Tobacco auctions are expected to open in April and run for over 20 
weeks.
   Last year, an average price of 13.80 Zimdollars per kg (then 1.73 
USD) was paid, realising 2.336 billion ZD (then 292 million USD).
   Webb said market intelligence showed demand would come from China, a 
huge producer and buyer of tobacco, where 1.7 billion kg had just been 
produced, down from the original forecast of 2.3 billion kg.
   "So there is a shortage and we can confirm that the Chinese have come 
here in the last two months and placed firm orders with all the 
merchants," hesaid.
   This year, Zimbabwe was expected to produce about 210 million kg of 
flue-cured tobacco, slightly up from the 198 million kg sold last 
season.
   Webb said the tobacco crop was looking good and growers were headed 
for a bumper season provided the current wet weather persists for 
another eight weeks.
   Meanwhile, Webb said Brazil and Zimbabwe - the world's leading 
producers of flue-cured tobacco - were calling for a fair price for 
their crop,particularly from leading manufacturers.
   He said although the two countries were the two most expensive 
producers, they nevertheless grew a quality crop without subsidies, 
unlike farmers in the United States and Europe.
   "We are trying to talk to each other about the price we should be 
receiving from manufacturers and merchants. Our basic message to 
Brazilian growers is that we should not expect to be paid third world 
prices," Webb, who recentlY returned from a marketing trip to Brazil, 
said.

Germany Agrees To Destroy Zambia's Toxic Waste

Panafrican News Agency
January 15, 1996 (19960115)
by Musengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia and Germany have signed a one-million-U.S.-
dollar contract for Germany to destroy 300 tonnes of expired pesticides 
that have been accumulating in an agricultural depot inthe Zambian 
capital, Lusaka, since 1984.
   Environmental Council of Zambia Director James Phiri said Sunday that 
the agreement had also been sponsored by the local office of the United 
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the FAO.
   Zambia lacks the technology to clean up the mess and has sought 
Germany's help.
   Phiri said that the consignment would be shipped through Tanzania. 
Zambia has already sought Tanzanian permission for the transportation of 
thechemicals.
   The United Nations based Convention on Toxic Materials all but bans 
its transportation across borders. However, it allows countries without 
the appropriate technology to contract others to destroy the toxins.
   Special conditions are needed for transport. These include tight 
packaging to avoid leakage. However, completely banded is the dumping of 
the waste by developed countries in undeveloped states.
   Zambia is reported to have substantial amounts of dangerous 
agricultural waste pesticides, particularly in the countryside. The 
government said earlyi n 1996 that it would take an inventory of the 
materials and collect it for destruction outside the country.
   Zambia's deputy agriculture minister, Gibson Nkausu, had estimated 
that thejob could cost some four miliion dollars.
   Nkausu warned then that government would, in future, surcharge 
agricultura lchemical dealers and users, apart from imposing statutory 
fines for flouting environment laws in handling their merchandise.
   The latest "state of the environment report" released last week by 
the Environment Council of Zambia said that commercial farmers in the 
country used more fertilisers, on average, than those in other sub-
Sahara African countries.
   According to the report, Zambian farmers used some 450,000 metric 
tonnes of agricultural chemicals during the 1992/93 farming season 
compared to 150,000 tonnes consumed two decades ago.
   Environment officials attributed the increased consumption rate to 
government's own promotion campaign of the agricultural industry since 
the 1970s to help attain national food self-sufficiency.
   The report noted that the use of chemicals had also contributed to 
soil acidity in areas and poisoning of some water catchments.
   Zambia imports almost 90 percent of the country's chemical 
requirements for agricultural and health purposes and it is estimated 
that 200 different pesticide trade names are currently in use.
   Zambia's environment council has said that lack of legislation on the 
importation of the chemicals had sometimes led banned pesticides coming 
into the country, thereby endangering environment, man and animal.

Donors to Fund Africa's Anti-Onchocercosis Project

Panafrican News Agency
January 17, 1996 (19960117)
by Mbakou, PANA Correspondent

   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo - The Africa Regional Director of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), Dr. Ebrahim Samba says he has convinced donors to 
continue financing the continent's anti-onchocercosis programme until 
theyear 2007.
   Speaking at a news conference at the WHO regional office in 
Brazzaville,Congo, Samba cited the World Bank, the United Nations 
Development Programme and the Food and Agriculture of Organization among 
donors which have shown interest in funding the programme.
   The UN health agency will be the executing body, added Samba, who was 
coordinator of a highly successful river-blindness eradication project 
in 11West African countries before he became WHO regional Director in 
1994.
   He said the new project estimated to cost of 120 million U.S dollars, 
will cover 16 African countries.
   Samba spoke to newsmen after a long tour of Europe, the United States 
and several African countries. He said the donors had also pledged to 
provide drugs, particularly ivermectine, to all the countries involved.
   He commended the emerging new partnership with U.N agencies, 
particularly the Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, the 
Fund fo rPopulation Activities (UNFPA), the International Labour 
Organization and other bilateral cooperation agencies in combating the 
incapcitating disease.
   According to figures released here, river blindness afflicts 18.5 
million people in 27 African countries.
   The debilitating disease, which affects rural dwellers, is spread by 
a small but aggressive black fly which breed on the banks of fast-
flowing rivers.
   The female fly lays its eggs in the eyes of human beings, infecting 
and sometimes disfiguring the skin around the eyes.

Nigerian Authorities Link Bread To Cancer

Panafrican News Agency
Janaury 16, 1996 (19960116)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - Bread was never in short supply on the breakfast 
table of many Nigerians until economic recesssion set in several years 
ago.
   But as austerity began to bite harder, loaves have gone thinner, 
although they cost thrice the normal price, and beyond the reach of the 
average Nigerian.
   But there is new twist to the availability of this erswhile staple, 
once regarded as the common man's food.
   Health and Food Administration officials have issued a warning that 
Nigerians risk contracting cancer through eating bread.
   At the centre of the controversy is a chemical known as "potassium 
bromate,"which bakers use in the treatment of flour.
   Nigeria's Food and Drug Administration agency was the first to raise 
an alarm on the chemical. The health warning is now echoed by the 
standard organisation of nigeria.
   Negotiations between the organisation and the Flour Millers 
Association is said to have broken down, with the warning from the 
organisation it might be forced to close down flour mills that fail to 
stop the use of the dangerous chemical.
   The millers are asking for a grace period of between six months and 
one year to phase out the use of the chemical.
   But the Director-General of the association Joseph Abalaka says this 
is too long and unacceptable, adding that an alternative, ascorbic acid, 
is available.
   He says "we cannot afford to risk the lives of Nigerians by allowing 
another six months of grace for the injection of cancer-causing agent."
   PANA has learnt that another round of negotiation has been called to 
end the deadlock.
   Despite being more expensive, some Nigerians say they cannot do 
withoutb read. The mills closure would unleash scarcity and make the 
commodity even more expensive.

[56.02Shillings = 1 USD].
   The share price has since appreciated reaching 31 shillings a share 
in the last 12 months.

Gabon Secures 77 million Dollars Loan from ADB

Panafrican News Agency
January 16, 1996 (19960116)

   DAKAR, Senegal - The Board of Directors of the African Development 
Bank (ADB), has approved a loan amounting to 53 million UA (about 77 
million dollars) for the funding of a major road project in the central 
African state of Gabon.
   The amount, mobilised from the resources of the bank's soft loan 
affiliate, the African Development Fund (ADF), carries a variable 
interest rate and is repayable within 15 years after a 5-year grace 
period, the ADB said in a statement.
   It involves rehabilitation of the Franceville-Laleyou road and the 
upgrading and surfacing of another stretch between Laleyou and 
Lastoursville in the south-eastern part of the country.
   The project forms part of the bank's development strategy in Gabon 
which aims at diversification of the economic sector through promotion 
of agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism.
   The ADB has so far undertaken 25 operations in Gabon at a total cost 
of 528.9 million UA (about 808 million dollars), in 21 projects, two 
structural adjustment schemes and studies.
   Initiated in 1963, the resources of the Abidjan-based bank is 
currently estimated at some 33 million dollars.
   The bank group is owned by 52 African governments and 25 non-African 
countries.

Traditional Medicine Becoming Popular in Zimbabwe

Panafrican News Agency
January 17, 1996 (19960117)


   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - High medical fees and the rising cost of 
drugsare forcing many Zimbabweans to resort to traditional medicine, 
which in the past was regarded as primitive.
   A combined traditional and conventional medical clinic, which started 
as a nexperiment soon after independence in 1980, reported an upsurge in 
the number of people seeking treatment in 1995.
   In an interview here, founder member and co-ordinator of the clinic, 
Barbar aSibanda, said 1995 was a busy year as patients, whose ailments 
modern medicine would have failed to cure, took to the clinic whose 
charges were lower than other health institutions.
   "Though I cannot give figures, the workload was more than what we 
expected.A lot more people are now aware of our services which have 
produced goodr esults," said Sibanda.
   The clinic, which pioneered the use of traditional herbs and modern 
medicine under one roof, has since opened a 20-bed maternity wing and a 
rural clinic in Chief Sigola's area in Matebeleland, South Western 
Zimbabwe.
   Patients have the choice of being treated by a medical doctor or 
traditional healers.
   Sibanda said the experiment had over the years proved that the two 
systems could be integrated to treat difficult diseases like mental 
illness, cancer, infertility and reversal of symptoms of the deadly 
AIDS.
   "Since we opened, we have never recorded any deaths of patients 
during the course of treatment. Our success rate rate is almost 100 
percent," she said.
   Dumezweni Sidambe, who heads the traditional section, which includes 
mid-wives, said infertility was a growing problem among young couples.
   He attributed it to over use of contraceptives at an early age, 
saying by the time they decided to have children, damage would have set 
in.
   "We have assisted hundreds of couples whose marriages were on the 
verge of breakdown to have children. Although we cannot claim to cure 
aids, we can safely reverse the symptoms," said sidambe.
   Sibanda said the clinic also ran a spiritual/faith healing section to 
cater for Christian believers and a free health advisory service.
   "We also have plans to open a herbal pharmacy and add a theatre to 
our maternity wing," said Sibanda.

Weekly Press Review

Panafrican News Agency
January 5, 1996 (19960105)
by Olu Sarr, PANA Staff Correspondent


   DAKAR, Senegal - Nigeria's withdrawal from Africa Cup and Yemen's 
"war" with Eritrea were among the most important editorials in the 
African press since the New Year started.
   The privately-owned Lagos newspaper, The Guardian, gave several 
reasons for Nigeria's demands for security guarantees for its players 
but also pointed to the path Abuja should take with regards to Nigeria's 
participation in the tournament. 
   "No responsible government would expose its citizens to clear and 
present dangers over which it has been forewarned,"itsaid.
   For example, it said, since the Munich massacre of its athletes in 
1972, Israel "has constantly"asked for such guarantee. 
   No government, it said, could legislate against snippers and going to 
South Africa would amount to taking risks. 
   "But what is wrong with that against the pledge by South Africa? We 
ought to take South Africa for her words for such guarantee would oblige 
her government to bend over backwards to guarantee the safety of 
Nigerians,"it said. 
   By withdrawing from South Africa '96, the government has also shown 
that "it no longer feels safe"in the world.  
   "That this is even happening to us in Africa makes itall the more 
shameful and worrisome. This is why South Africa '96 ought to provide an 
opportunity for some soul-searching,"itsaid.
   It wondered why Nigeria had become so unwanted. Why this nation, 
which used to be touted as "The Giant of Africa,"now felt so unsafe even 
within the continent ?. 
   "The solution to all this is for the government to urgently take 
steps that will bring it back to the internationa lcommunity, it said. 
   "The government should consider rescinding the withdrawal because our 
participation offers opportunities for Nigeria and South Africa to move 
closer to understanding and rapprochement on the diplomatic front. The 
implications of ourwithdrawal are not in our interest."
   This view was shared by another privately-owned Lagos daily, the 
Vanguard. 
   "If the point government wants to make is about the safety of our 
players, we believe it has been made and the South African authorities, 
CAF and FIFA have taken notices of it. 
   "The logical thing now is for us to be in South Africa,so that the 
Super Eagles can fly the nation's banner as the continent's defending 
champions,"it said. 
   In Addis Ababa The Monitor commented on the insecurity in the Horn of 
Africa, the most recent example being the two-day battle between 
Eritrean and Yemeni forces on the Hanish Islands. 
   "Unless urgently settled the recent Asmara-Sanaa controversy has the 
potential to degenerate into a large-scale crisis involving other intra 
as well as extra regional actors,"it said. "And this must not be allowed 
to happen under any circumstance."
   It warned: "Once a minor conflict goes out of control,the price that 
would be paid to restore the equilibrium would be extremely painful. 
Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia should serve as living reminders that there 
is no dividend to be reaped from aconflict."
   Dakar's Sud Quotidien focused its attention on the change of prime 
minister made by Mauritania President Maouya Ould Taya. He got rid of 
the youthful Sidi Mohammed Ould Boubacar for Cheikh Alavia Ould Mohamed 
Khouna. 
   Why? 
   "To prepare better for the next elections,"it said. 
   Another reason, it said, was because of the recent poor relations 
between Libya and Mauritania: Ould Boubacar is considered a Libyan 
sympathiser and an adherent of Kadaffi's Green Book. 
   Ould Boubacar's departure became imminent, it said, when his 
potential rival and former Interior Minister Lemrabott Ould Sidi 
Mahmoud, returned to government. 
   Behind all this, it said, was Taya's wish to balance the power among 
the regions of the country. The appointment of a native of the Eastern 
Region as prime minister replacing one from the Central Region, it said, 
was "a clear demonstration of this."
   The Eastern Regions, the most populated parts of thecountry, voted 
largely for Taya during the 1992 presidential elections. But it noted 
that the electorate here, in part, joine dthe opposition during the 
municipal elections of 1995. This shift and the gains by the opposition 
in the strategic region, it said, explained Taya's choice. 
    Notwithstanding the effort to appease voters in the east, it said 
"few changes are expected in the current cabinet so as not to 
frustrate"other communities. Three months after being unbanned by 
Nigerian military rulers, the National Concord newspaper of detained 
millionaire-politician, Moshood Abiola, returned to the newsstands 
Tuesday. 
   In a front page editorial entitled "A New Start, A New Resolve,"the 
Concord said it was returning to the newsstands as a "beneficiary of an 
official reprieve of sorts." The daily said that it had been banned for 
18 months along with other titles of the Concord Press "without reason 
and without recourse to the due process of law."
   Saying it was glad to rejoin the "front ranks of the Nigerian 
press,"the Concord, however, said it did not "regard the unbanning as a 
special favour to be reciprocated with a show of remorse and 
contriction, but as belated undoing of what should not have been done in 
the first place."
   In its 15 years of existence, the paper said, it had"consistently 
championed the ideals of a free and responsible press". 
   Nigeria, it said, needed to make rapid progress toward democracy. 
   "The fundamental truth,"it said "is that without democracy, there can 
be no self-actualisation of the citizens, no public accountability, no 
good government and, ultimately no meaningful development."

Business
Institute Prepares Code for Zimbabwean Companies

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - To improve corporate governance of Zimbabwean 
companies, the country's Institute of Directors (IOD) plans to introduce 
and enforce an acceptable code of conduct.  
   The IOD is a non-profit, voluntary body established to promote 
excellence, enterprise and integrity in directors of companies.   IOD's 
Executive Director, John Dittrich said Tuesday his group would work with 
such organisations as the Zimbabwe stock exchange to promote good 
business ethics in line with international trends.   "We want to promote 
the establishment of audit committees to ensure that management is 
cultivating good ethics," Dittrich told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News 
Agency.  
   He said the IOD would study far-reaching recommendations made in the 
United Kingdom by the Cadbury report, which called for more transparency 
in the running of publicly quoted companies.  
   "As we progress, there is going to be greater awareness of the real 
responsibilities of a director: to make them understand that it's not 
just a question of sitting on a board of a company," Dittrich said.  
   Executive or non-executive directors, he said, had to appreciate the 
problems and future plans of the companies on whose boards they sat, and 
be seen to be making meaningful contributions.  
   Dittrich said among other strategies to improve corporate governance, 
the iod would hold a series of seminars and conferences where a wide 
range of issues about running a company would be discussed.  
   "We are not an examining body, but one of the features of our 
activities during 1996 will be in the area of training and seminars to 
inform people in business about their responsibilities." 
   He said the IOD would also during the year broaden its membership 
base so as to achieve a large and diversified membership of the 
institute and try to achieve effective representation of directors' 
views to government and other regulatory bodies as well as the business 
community.  
   "We want to demonstrate that we are providing members with the 
services that they need and, in that regard, developing our relationship 
with government ministries will encourage people to join the iod because 
they can derive some benefit from such membership,"Dittrich said.  
   The institute would also consult and make representations to 
government on matters affecting the Zimbabwean business companies 
particularly during annual pre-budget meetings with the Ministry of 
Finance.

Cameroon
Biya Expresses Hope

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   YAOUNDE, Cameroon - The Cameroonian President Paul Biya has expressed 
satisfaction over economic progress made by his country during the year 
1995.  
   "After several years of recession, Cameroon is back on the road to 
growth"with a 3.3 per cent rate, Biya said in an address to the 
Cameroonian nation on national radio and television.  
   Cameroon, like the other countries in Africa's Franc Zone, had a 50 
per cent devaluation of its currency in Januray 1994.  
   Biya said the devaluation had led to some recovery and state revenues 
had risen to 45 billion f cfa in 1995 as against 17 billion cfa the 
previous year (1$ US =480 cfa).  
   The liberalisation of the economy, he said, had made it possible for 
a positive trade balance.  Biya said there had also been a a 13 per cent 
increase in foreign investments in the country.  
   He reiterated his willingness to continue +the ruthless war"initiated 
in June 1995 against customs fraud and sabotage of the national economy.  
   "If recovery efforts proceed normally, the year 1996 will enable 
Cameroonians to see, at last, the end of the economic crisis,"Biya said.

   DAKAR, Senegal - Lesotho's Timothy Thahane, a loser in the bid to 
succeed Babacar Ndiaye at the the African Development Bank (ADB) in Cote 
d'Ivoire, started work Monday as vice-president for the World Bank's 
relations with the United Nations.  
   Thahane, who was the bank's secretary at the time he run for the ADB 
presidency from May to September, lost the race to the Moroccan Omar 
Mohamed Kabbaj, the Word Bank said in a communique. He will in his new 
post be charged with strengthening, coordinating and developing 
relations between the financial institution and the United Nations. The 
bank's president James Wolfenson said Thahane had been appointed "on the 
strength of his broad understanding of the of the functioning of 
international organisations.
   "Thahane is going to strengthen and increase our partnership with the 
United Nations,"he added.  
   Thahane was since April 1980 vice-president and secretary of the 
World Bank. Prior to that, he was the bank's secretary (1974-1976), then 
deputy-administrator (1976-1978) and ambassador of Lesotho in the United 
States (1978-1980).

Zambia
Foreign Reserves Dwindle 

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)
by Muengwa Kayaya, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LUSAKA, Zambia - Government expenditure on importation of famine 
relief food and debt servicing commitments have contributed to the 
depletion of Zambia's foreign reserves said by central bank officials to 
have been around only USD 220 million dollars by last November.  
   According to Zambia's central bank statistics published Tuesday, 
Zambia had USD 257 million last October but this fell to USD 219.296 the 
following month.  
   Central bank officials said in Lusaka Tuesday that December figures 
were not yet computed.  
   Debt serving over the same period increased to USD 34.million for 
November from USD 16 million the previous month.  
   Zambia is to import an estimated 1,000,000 tonnes of famine relief 
maize to meet the shortfall caused by several dry seasons.  
   The country has an external debt of USD 6 billion dollars and the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December granted it some USD 850 
million as balance of payments support, debt servicing and project and 
goods and services financing for 1996.   The Paris Club donors have said 
however that disbursement of the funds is dependent on Zambia's "good-
governance"record and continued adherence to a harsh structural 
adjustment programme.   Most Zambians, whose standard of living has been 
adversely affected by a general economic decline, blame the programme 
for their current economic hardships.

Zimbabwe
Industrialists Express Economic Worries

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - Industrialists in western Zimbabwe on Tuesday 
said business confidence was at its lowest level in years and warned of 
job losses as companies struggle to survive the country's harsh economic 
climate.
   "From an employment view point, its sheer gloom and despondency. 
There is so much de-industrialisation and I see more retrenchmenzs,"said 
Mr. Harding, a member of the Matabeleland Chamber of Industries (MCI's) 
labour committee. He said in an interview all of Zimbabwe's economic 
indicators were negative with many companies holding huge stocks because 
of depressed domestic demand and less competitive exports.  
   Several companies in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, were 
liquidated or forced to retrench staff last year due to a lack of export 
incentives, high interest rates and a decline in profitability.
   At least 10 companies in the region had either closed down, downsized 
or relocated to other places, according to the MCI. Most companies which 
had seen their competitiveness eroded by high wage costs would continue 
retrenching, cutting part time jobs and overtime pay, compelling 
consumers to tighten their purse strings further to cope with negative 
growth in real incomes, Harding said. 
  He said it was unlikely retrenched workers would be rehired since 
companies would be trying to produce cost-effectively.  
   "The low corporate productivity thus reduces the government's revenue 
base," he said. He predicted a trend, by cash-strapped workers, to press 
demands for better wages and salaries commensurate with the high cost of 
living.  
   The problem was that current high rates of inflation were built into 
production costs, putting basic products beyond the reach of many 
people.
   Harding said although Zimbabwe's rainfall pattern had been 
favourable, there was uncertainty on whether more rains would last for 
some time to sustain fragile recovery underway. "Besides, even if we 
have good rains, the economic effect would be felt around october or 
November,"he said.
   The MCI warned that unless measures were undertaken to encourage both 
domestic and foreign investment, the country could be "turned into a 
nation of shopkeepers rather than manufacturers".

Mozambique
More State Firms to be Privatised

Panafrican News Agency
January 2, 1996 (19960102)

   MAPUTO, Mozambique - As part of the privatisation process in 
Mozambique, the government is selling 80 per cent of the share capital 
of a state company specialising in cold storage and air conditioning 
systems.  
   The company, Enafrio, has been valued at USD 1.6 million. It 
currently employs 144 workers and is the only company of its kind in 
Mozambique.  
   Among other state companies coming up for privatisation soon are the 
tea-processing company (Emocha), and the farm implement factory (Agro-
Alfa).   The shipyard at the central port city of Beira and Hidraulica 
de Maputo, a company specialising in irrigation systems and civil 
construction, will also be sold in the near future.  
   However, the most important privatisation this year will be the sale 
of 51 per cent of the share capital of the national commercial bank. 
This will be the first privatisation of a state-owned bank in Mozambique 
and could happen in June.   Since 1992, the Mozambican state has sold 
nealy 550 companies. Forty-five of these were large companies and 
included the country's cement factory and brewerries. Their sale earned 
the state USD 5 million.

Angola
Luanda's Tall War-Induced Environment Agenda

Panafrican News Agency
Janaury 1, 1996 (19960101)
by Peter Masebu, PANA Staff Correspondent

   DAKAR, Senegal - The guns might completely go silent in Angola in 
1996 but they will leave behind gigantic ecological and environmental 
problems. 
   Three decades of civil war, starting with the anti-colonial struggle, 
caused so much environmental degradation that no Angolan can claim to 
have escaped from its effects. 
   Angola's Director of Environment, Joao Da Costa Vintem, said in an 
interview with PANA recently that although the country is vast with a 
small population of about 10 million, many people have moved to urban 
centers, mostly located in fragile coastal lands. 
   "Most of the war-displaced people moved to Luanda, Benguela or 
Lobito, slashing trees in the surrounding areas for fuel or to create 
plots for cultivation," he added. 
   Vintem said these activities have further helped the northward 
advance of the Namib desert, which occupies a large portion of 
neighboring Namibia's territory. 
   The rural-urban exodus, Vintem said, has more than trippled the 
populations of Angolan towns including Luanda, the capital, which was 
originally meant to host 500,000 people. 
   "The huge population inflow has led to the destruction of most public 
amenities, especially urban water supply and sanitation systems. Solid 
and liquid wastes abound everywhere causing endemic diseases like 
diarrhea and cholera as well as malaria," he said. 
   Vintem hopes that the Nov. 20, 1994 Lusaka peace accord between the 
government and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola, UNITA, will soon be fully implemented "so that people can return 
to their natural sites after the removal of mines, the greatest 
environmental hazard in rural areas." 
   Enormous environmental degradation has also occured in diamond mining 
areas which are now full of pits. 
   "Mining companies also diverted water from rivers leaving the 
population without water, especially in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sud," he 
said. 
   The Angolan Environment director said discussions were underway to 
ensure that the mining companies involved take part in efforts to 
restore the environment. 
   "The government has to find a way of ending the anarchy reigning in 
the mining area since the removal of restrictions on people to enter the 
area which existed under the former one party rule," added the director. 
   As a major off-shore oil producer, Angola also suffers from oil 
spills in its coastal waters, endangering the once abundant fish there. 
   The shores off the oil-rich Cabinda enclave has been so polluted that 
government had to ask the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company to help in cleaning 
up operations. The oil company has appointed a Swiss firm, which has 
taken water samples from the polluted sea coast. 
   To reverse these dangerous trends, the Department of Environment has 
asked the government to include an environment national plan of action 
among its priorities when negotiating with aid donors, the first of 
whose meeting took place in Brussels last September. 
   Vintem said approaches had also been made to the World Bank to 
finance feasibilities for an environment protection code and the 
creation of an environment information center. 
   "I know that government's priority will be the reconstruction of 
destroyed cities like Huambo, Kuito and others. But locally sourcing 
environment funds is important because the environment forms the basis 
for sustainable development," he concluded. -0-

Cameroon
Ecological War Between Humans and Elephants

Panafrican News Agency
January 1, 1996 (19960101)

   DAKAR, Senegal - Living together is more and more difficult for 
villagers and elephants in northern Cameroon as the animals pose a 
continuing menance to farms and even local housing.  
   The Conservation News Service from the World Wildlife Fund has said 
"about 350 elephants destroyed 285 hectares of crops belonging to 516 
families" in Cameroon in 1995.  
   Quoting Dourga Albert, a wildlife chief forest warden in Cameroon, 
the journal said the damage affected not less than 3 127 people, 
directly.  
   In a report for the WWF, John Nchami Tafor, said there were some 20 
000 elephants in Cameroon.  
   About 2 000 elephants (Loxondonia Africana Africana) live in northern 
Cameroon's dry savannah. They are essentialy gathered in the Waza and 
Kalamaloue national parks. The others (Loxondonia Africana Cyclotis) 
spread into southern Cameroon's thick tropical forests.  
   Relations between human beings and elephants are particularly 
strained in the dry savannah, where the situation has worsened in the 
last five years, says the WWF.  
   In July 1992, said WWf, 320 marauding elephants destroyed 5 000 
hectares of crops. This was at a time of drought and poor food security.  
   Some 22 000 people suffered from the starvation that followed.  
   Between May and November 1993, a large herd of some 850 elephants 
destroyed 1 700 hectares of millet and cotton in Mayor Kani and Mayor 
Louti districts in the north, leading to further harm to peasant 
incoomes.  
   Between May and September 1994, 400 to 500 elephants destroyed millet 
and cotton throughout the country.  
   A lack of food and water is the main source of the conflict between 
human settlements and the elephants, the WWF says. 
   It says a full grown elephant needs some 140 kgs of food (grasses, 
leaves, fruits, roots, bark) daily. It also drinks 100 litres of water 
daily and can move up to 30 kms just for a cold bath.  
   As farms and tourist camps take over their places, Cameroon's 
elephants are turning to crops to feed themselves.      
   Experts say the number of elephants in Cameroon has increased due to 
the country's adoption, reluctantly, of a global ban on trade in ivory 
in 1989.  
   "When they migrate, elephants follow a precise direction. If they 
find crops on their way they destroy them" says Hillaire Manga, a 
wildlife department head in northern Cameroon.

Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire)
Collaborative Study Launched on Ebola

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)

   DAKAR, Senegal - After the discovery of an Ebola patient in Cote 
d'Ivoire recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a 
two-year study aimed at identifying the natural host reservoir of the 
deadly virus in that country.
   The study will involve representatives of virtually every laboratory 
facility in the world "that is capable to safely handling the Ebola 
virus for study," says the U.N health agency in a news release. 
   A team of researchers will concentrate their efforts on Tai forest 
where a new sub-type of the Ebola virus was isolated from a Swiss 
primate researcher thought to have been infected in late 1994 while 
performing an autopsy on a dead chimpanzee from which the same Ebola 
sub-type was isolated.
   "The Tai forest of Cote d'Ivoire is considered to be a more conducive 
site for such investigation, as it is a well defined ecosystem that has 
been extensively studied and one where the disease is known to be 
present," the WHO release said. 
   The new study group will base their initial investigation on the 
research by the Swiss-Ivorian ethology team of which the infected 
researcher was a member. 
   "The focus of investigation is the relationship among primates, other 
vertebrates, anthropods and perhaps human beings in the region of the 
Tai forest," said the WHO press release.  Among the closest contacts of 
the chimpanzees are Colobus monkeys, which serve as a major food source 
for the chimpanzees, it added. 
   The 12-member informal working group involved in the study held its 
first meeting Dec. 15, 1995.The meeting was also attended by seven WHO 
professionals, including four from headquarters and three from the 
African region.
   Among the Africans in the research team are Dr Deogratias 
Barakamfitiye and Dr Kadri Tankari from the Brazzaville-based Africa 
Regional Office. These were involved in another study on the Ebola 
virus, which killed at least 250 people in Kikwit, Zaire between April 
and June 1995.The findings are not yet out. 
   The Ebola virus is one of the most pathogenic viral agents known to 
man, causing death in 80 percent or more of infected cases. 
   The World Health Organization said last year that it wilL hold an 
international symposium in Kinshasa, Zaire in March on the Ebola virus 
and the haemorrhagic fever it causes.

Zimbabwe
Over 150 People Regain Sight

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)

   HARARE, Zimbabwe - Over 150 residents of Gokwe in Zimbabwe's Midlands 
Province suffering from various eye disorders had their eye sight 
restored during a Raleigh International expedition between October and 
December 1995.
   In a report on Tuesday chronicling its 10-week programme of projects 
throughout Zimbabwe, Raleigh said one of the highlights of the 
expedition was organising an eye camp in the Gokwe area in which 156 
patients with cataracts and other eye disorders had their eye sight 
restored, often after years of blindness.
   A further 6,137 people in the area underwent tests to determine the 
degree of eye sight loss. 
   The free eye operations and tests were conducted in conjunction with 
the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Council For The Blind and the 
American-based Charity See International. 
   The expedition, which was Raleigh International's 13th to Zimbabwe 
comprised 10 projects and 108 participants from Britain, Hong Kong, New 
Zealand, Singapore and Zimbabwe.
   Other projects undertaken included the building of a fire tower at 
the Chilojo cliffs, Gonarezhou national park, to provide early warning 
of damaging bush fires.
   With funding from the British High Commission, Raleigh International 
started the construction of an accommodation block for 28 elderly 
residents of the Zimbabwe New Hope Home at Gatsi in the Honde valley. 
   The participants also built two new pans and repaired seven bore hole 
pump houses providing water supplies to wildlife in the Hwange National 
Park in Western Zimbabwe.

Nigeria
Doctor Researching a Male Contraceptive

Panafrican News Agency
January 3, 1996 (19960103)
by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent

   LAGOS, Nigeria - A Nigerian doctor Nnaemeka Amobi and his British 
counterpart Christopher Smith, both of the London King's College, are on 
the threshold of a scientific breakthrough in the development of male 
contraceptive.
   According to a recent issue of the "new scientist' magazine, the 
research of the two physiologists on the unusual side-effects associated 
with two drugs --phenoxybenzamine used in the treatment of high blood 
pressure and thioridazine for schizophrenia -- has proved beneficial.
   It is common knowledge in medical circles that both drugs prevent 
ejaculation, although men who take them still experience orgasms. 
   But their side-effects such as drowsiness had made the drugs 
unsuitable for prescription as contraceptives for men. 
   The research by Amobi and Smith showed that the drugs prevent 
ejaculation by "temporarily paralysing the sperm duct muscles" 
responsible for transporting sperm from the testes to the penis," the 
magazine said. 
   The two doctors were quoted as saying the research finding could 
result in a safe male contraceptive pill. 
   They say unlike the female version, the male pill could be taken as 
and when required. 
   Smith believes the "discovery opens up a new category of 
contraceptive. It gives rise to the first chemical vasectomy because the 
drugs can control the duct using a pincer movement." 
   Amobi agrees, saying the discovery would be of great benefit to 
developing countries in their quest for effective population control 
measures. 
   Above all, he said, "vasectomies are regarded with great suspicion," 
in the this part of the world.
