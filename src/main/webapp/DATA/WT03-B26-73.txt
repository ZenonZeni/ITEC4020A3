<H4>3.3 Semi-empirical Methods</H4>
Semi-empirical models have also been developed which are empirical but are
based on physical models and often contain parameters that relate to surface
parameters. They offer the means of using the mosaic approach and 'empirical'
model fitting but also enable surface parameters to be extracted. The methods
are called 'semi-empirical' because they generally assume atmospheric correction
can be done and also often have forms that involve earth surface parameters.
The main class of these models is that of the 'kernel' models.<BR>
The following text describing the kernel approach was extracted from the
MODIS-Land ATBD (Strahler et al., 1995; or at the following web site: <A HREF="http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/modistables.html">http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/modistables.html</A>).<BR>

<B>3.3.1 Theoretical Description<BR>
</B><BR>
Kernel-driven models for the bidirectional reflectance distribution function
of vegetated land surfaces attempt to describe the BRDF as a linear superposition
of a set of kernels that describe basic BRDF shapes, with the coefficients
or weights chosen to adapt the sum of the kernels to the given case. Typically,
semiempirical kernels are based either on one of several possible approximations
to a radiative transfer scenario of light scattering in a horizontally homogeneous
plant canopy (e.g., a crop canopy), or on one of several approximations
feasible in a geometric-optical model of light scattering from a surface
covered with vertical projections that cast shadows (e.g., a forest canopy).
Deriving a kernel of this nature requires simplifying and manipulating a
model for the BRDF until it reaches the form:<BR>

Semiempirical kernels can be of two types. First, they may contain only
geometric terms, but no physical parameters. The complete model then is
linear, and may be scaled to arbitrary scales even for mixed scenes; neglecting
adjacency effects, the weights of the kernels will be linear functions of
the areal proportions of the subpixel weights. The so-called Ross-kernels,
which are approximations to the radiative transfer theory in plant canopies
of Ross (1981) described below, belong to this class, as does the so-called
Roujean geometric-optical kernel (Roujean et al., 1992). In the second case,
kernels contain one or very few physical parameters and thus instead of
having one kernel, provide a family of kernels depending on these parameters.
The geometric-optical Li-kernels (Wanner et al., 1995) belong to this type.
In order to reduce them to the form given in (5), the kernel-internal parameters
are fixed to a selection of a few values each. The following discussion
presents each of the kernels used in the BRDF/Albedo algorithm. For more
complete information on the theory and derivation of the kernels, see Wanner
et al. (1995).<BR>
