<B>Project Title:  Homopolar EV Traction Motor Development for Improved Safety and Reduced Cost
<p>
Performing Organization:The University of Texas, Center for Electromechanics</B><p>

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 
<P>
Homopolar motors are an attractive alternative to conventional DC and induction machines for hybrid
and all­electric vehicles both civilian and military Known for their high current capability, this inherent
characteristic allows high power levels to be achieved from a low voltage power supply of 50 volts Fifty
volt EV drivetrains of which several advantages include: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     Improved safety (50 volts represents a safety threshold; electrical codes require no special safety provisions for systems below 50 volts);
<LI>     Controllers lend themselves to the use of high efficiency MOSFET switching devices;
<LI>     Hybrid drivetrains are possible with as few as 5 standard EV lead acid batteries (high voltage systems require strings of batteries to produce system voltage); 
<LI>     Long strings of batteries, which tend to experience lifetime problems, can be avoided; and
<LI>     Reduced system cost appear feasible, primarily due to controller simplicity.</UL></P>

<P>Work on this project began in May 1995, and a prototype motor design has been completed, sized at
100 kW for a small transit bus. This design uses a four­pass armature and operates at a peak current
of 5,000 Amps from a 48­voit battery pack. </P>

<P>Brush testing is in progress to address efficiency improvements, document wear rates, and confirm
operation of several new low­cost and compact brush actuater designs. Test data obtained so far
shows excellent operation of a constant force spring­actuated brush and brush holder design.
Brush wear rates at normal driving conditions appear to be far less than those obtained from worst
case speed and current loading conditions cited in previous studies. This is very encouraging
considering the typical duty cycle of the bus. </P>

<P>To regulate power flow to the motor, CEM is investigating a high­current pulse width modulator (WPM)
controller based on a highly parallel array of MOSFET switching devices For low voltage systems,
MOSFETs are an ideal choice given their low on state resistance, high switching frequency, low
switching losses, and ease of parallel operation A 300 Amp prototype has been assembled, and
testing is under way to confirm operation with a low impedance load.</P>

<P>In conjunction with the motor design and fabrication effort, UT­CEM is addressing system integration
issues, with special emphasis on hybrid drivetrains. </P>
