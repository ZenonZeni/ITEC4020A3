<BR>
<B>Patrick S. Adams</B>, 35, in June was named portfolio manager of the $2.6 billion <A  HREF="../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>, our flagship growth equity
mutual fund. Adams, who brings an impressive record as a growth
investment style manager, is the latest in a series of enhancements
to Kemper's equity investment team in the last year.
<P>
As part of an August 1995 acquisition, Kemper through its new
wholly owned subsidiary Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. (DVA) assumed
management responsibility for <A  HREF="../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A> and <A  HREF="../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value
Fund</A>.
<P>
With the acquisition of DVA came the value investing style of
David Dreman, who is generally considered the pioneer of a contrarian
investment strategy. Dreman is the chairman of DVA and manages
Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund.  Christian Bertelsen in March joined DVA as chief
investment officer and portfolio manager of Kemper-Dreman Contrarian
Fund. Bertelsen has an outstanding track record as an investment
manager and practitioner of the contrarian investment strategy.
<P>
Shortly after the DVA acquisition, Kemper hired veteran portfolio
manager Steven Reynolds to oversee and direct the company's equity
investment department. Reynolds served as interim manager for
Kemper Growth Fund until Adams joined Kemper in June.
<P>
In addition to assuming responsibility for the Kemper-Dreman Funds,
the company in the last year introduced four new equity funds:
<A  HREF="../funds/europe.html">Kemper Europe Fund</A>, <A  HREF="../funds/assetallocation.html">Kemper Horizon Fund</A>, <A  HREF="../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth
Fund</A> and <A  HREF="../funds/quantitative.html">Kemper Quantitative Equity Fund</A>.
