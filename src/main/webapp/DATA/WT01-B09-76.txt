<B>Project Title:  Infrastructure & Energy End­Use Metering<p>

Performing Organization: PSI Energy, Indianapolis Power & Light</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Madelyn Harwood, PSI Energy, (317) 838­1518<br>
Jim Wittman, IPL, (317) 261­8214</P>

Project Summary: 

<P>PSI Energy and Indianapolis Power & Light have provided or will be providing the proper
infrastructure to support the operation of the Electricore electric pickup trucks and hybrid electric buses at the
user­sites. This support includes outlet and circuit installation for each vehicle and ongoing technical support.</P>

<P>Electricore, EPRI, and PSI Energy are working in consortium with others to analyze performance parameters of
EV. PSI Energy is adding their end­use metering expertise to quantify the battery charging system. Vehicles being
tested have an on­board charging system ­ when the batteries approach depletion, the operator plugs the car into
any 220­volt outlet and the batteries reach full charge in a matter of hours. PSI teamed with ABB to use their Alpha
electric utility reserve meter for EV charging analysis. The Alpha is an electronic meter capable of kW, kVA, and
kVAR metering. It is designed to handle a variety of voltages. A compact, redesigned meter called the Portable
Alpha emerged. It is enclosed in a tough plastic case and can meter consumption of various voltage levels. In
analyzing EV charging, the meter allows the time and date to be stored, along with the consumption during a
15­minute time interval. Months of data can be stored in the meter. Data is retrieved via an optical port. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>Infrastructure support and data acquisition support for electric pickup demonstration.</P> 

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P><P>On­going & concurrently with electric pickup/bus demonstration.
