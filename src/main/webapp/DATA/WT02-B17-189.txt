<h2>Life Cycle Cost Software<BR>Updated for FY1997</h2>

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
updated the Building Life-Cycle Cost (BLCC) and related economic
analysis software for use by Government agencies and the private
sector during fiscal year 1997.  This version, designated as BLCC
4.4-97, has been updated with both the DOE and OMB discount rates
for FY 1997, and includes projected energy price escalation rates
from the DOE/EIA <I>Annual Energy Outlook 1996</I>. 
<P>
BLCC provides comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis capabilities
for capital investment projects that are intended primarily to
reduce operating-related expenditures (especially energy and water
costs) in future years.  Mutually-exclusive project alternatives
(e.g., HVAC systems or insulation levels) can be compared to determine
which has the lowest life-cycle cost.  Savings-to-investment ratio
and other comparative measures of economic performance can also
be calculated, as well as projected energy savings and reductions
in green-house gas emissions.
<P>
A number of changes have been made to BLCC 4.4-97 compared to
last year's version.  These changes are described in the
software's supporting documentation.  One change is to highlight
the importance of using local utility rate information when it
can be obtained with a high level of confidence.  When it is not
available, the energy price escalation rates are available for
project cost estimating.  Another change involves improvements
in the ability to interface more closely with the NIST ERATES
program.  ERATES allows users to set up block-rate, time-of-use-rate,
and demand-rate schedules for local electricity prices and project-specific
electricity usage files for use in calculating annual electricity
costs.  There have also been a number of changes in the military
construction (MILCON) mode of analysis requested by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to correspond to changes in the Defense Department
Tri-Service's life-cycle cost calculation requirements. 
<P>
BLCC and its related programs (including ERATES, DISCOUNT, EMISS,
and BLCC Quick Input) can be downloaded from the FEMP Internet
home page at www.eren.doe.gov/femp under the Technical Assistance
icon, or may also be obtained free of charge by calling the FEMP
Help Desk at 800-DOE-EREC (363-3732).
