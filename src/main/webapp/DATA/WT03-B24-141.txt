<H1>Spooks</h1>
<h2>aka black money, and the Intellegence Community</h2>
There are lots of spook agencies arround DC. This lists the ones
I know, if you know of more, please <a href="mailto:pfarrell@isse.gmu.edu">
email me the information.</a>
<p>
Alphabetically:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia"> Central Intellegence Agency</a>
<li><!a href="http://www. ">Defense Intellegence Agency </a>
<li><a href="http://www.fbi.gov"> Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>
<li>National Reconnasence Office
<li><a href="http://www.nsa.gov:8080">National Security Agency </a>
<li>Not a spook agency, but still an interesting place is
 <a href="http://www.nsa.gov:8080/museum"> National Cryptographic Museum</a>
<li><!a href="http://www."> Secret Service</a>
</ul>
Locations of spook offices.
<p>
CIA
<ul>
<li>Headquarters are in Langley VA. Just off Rt 123 between McLean and
the George Washington Parkway. There is a big sign, you can't miss it. The sign was put up about 10 years ago. Before that, there was no sign, but everyone
knew where it was, and that was in the heavily guarded, unmarked compound.
<li>Offices in Roslyn VA. There are several ugly blue office 
buildings in Roslyn that are used as overflow office space. They have
been in use at least since 1969.
<li>Offices in Vienna. I know they are there, but don't know which building.
I know that folks working there hang out at the Vienna Inn, a dive bar.
If you know, please <a href="mailto:pfarrell@isse.gmu.edu">mail me </a>
<li>Offices in Reston. Ditto
<li>Offices in Lake Fairfax (outside Reston). Rumour has it that the CIA
has most of the building on Bussiness Circle that has prominent PRC signs
on it. I know that the guards are not PRC guards, and that PRC has only
a few floors.
</ul>
<p>
NSA
<ul>
<li>HQ is clearly in Fort Meade MD.
<li>other offices?
If you know, please <a href="mailto:pfarrell@isse.gmu.edu">mail me </a>
</ul>
NRO
<ul>
<li>there was a big deal made a year or so ago about the NRO's secret
headquarters that was being built as a defense contractor's office
just outside of Dulles Aiport.
<li>Other offices?
If you know, please <a href="mailto:pfarrell@isse.gmu.edu">mail me </a>
</ul>
<p>
DIA
<ul>
<li>HQ is in Arlington VA, within a few blocks of the Pentagon. I'll have
to drive arround to get the exact spot next time I go to Whitey's.
</ul>
<p>
FBI
<ul>
<li>HQ is a big, ugly building on Pennsylvania Avenue downtown.
<li>Regional offices are all over the country.
</ul>
<p>
Unknown agency, but clearly spooks
<ul>
<li>
 1517 Westbranch Drive 
<p>
Go out to Tysons Corner in Northern Virginia, take Exit 11 off I-495 [aka       
the infamous "Beltway"] and head west on Rte 123. Take the first right
onto Tysons Blvd, and then another right onto Galleria Drive, and then
yet another right onto Westbranch Drive.
</ul>
