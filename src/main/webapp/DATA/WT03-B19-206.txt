<H2>Australia</H2>
The forest products sector has sales of around $9 billion and employs 65,000 people.
<P>
Output of paper and paper products, including printing, have increased strongly since mid-1993 reflecting increased demand for paper packaging and containers. Production of wood and wood products has declined since 1994 due to the downturn in residential construction.
<P>
Australia exports $1.1 billion of forest products.  Exports of forest products have increased on average by 10% over the past three years, including strong growth in the export of wood.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Victoria's forest products industry has sales of about $3 billion and employs 15,000 people.  Victoria accounts for 34% of national paper and fibreboard container production, 29% of furniture production and 21% of wood and wood products output.
<P>
The hardwood timber industry continues to undergo extensive restructuring and reinvestment. Long-term contracts have facilitated restructuring and a shift toward greater value-adding for both import substitution and export. Softwood timber production has increased as the softwood plantation resource has matured.
<P>
The pulp and paper industry in Victoria is dominated by Australian Paper, a division of Amcor, which has pulp and paper manufacturing plants at Maryvale (the largest in Australia), Fairfield and Broadford.  <P>
Pratt Industries manufactures cardboard boxes at its Coolaroo and Reservoir facilities.  Bowater manufactures tissue products at its Box Hill plant and mechanical pulp at Myrtleford. Australian Newsprint Mills at Albury and Kimberley Clark at Millicent in South Australia are significant users of Victoria's forest resources.
<P>
Exports of forest products, consisting mainly of woodchips and pulp, were $250 million in 1995.  Pulp and paper exports are mainly destined for New Zealand and woodchips are mainly sold to Japan.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The sawn timber industry remains largely dependent for sales on residential construction activity, although opportunities do exist and are being pursued for increased sales in the international market and for import replacement.
<P>
Amcor has committed $380 million for expansion of the Maryvale Paper Mill. Other projects include a $70m MDF plant at Dominance Timber Industries, Wangaratta and a $50m box plant at Pratt Industries, Dandenong.  <P>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected that sales of wood and paper products will grow at just over 3% through to 2005-6.
