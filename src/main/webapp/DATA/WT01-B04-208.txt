<h3><A NAME = "Using Aides">Using Aides, Volunteers, and Peer Support</a></h3><P>

<p>An extra hand is always needed in a VE class.  Many teachers are fortunate
to have aides or paraprofessionals assigned to their classes.  Some teachers
use the school volunteer program to lend a hand.   Students can also be a
welcome source of assistance to teachers.  This section provides some
recommendations for ensuring success with assistants in the classroom.</i>

<h3><A NAME = "Common Concerns">Common Concerns</A></h3><P>

<i>Who's in charge?  </i>The most common problem faced when bringing aides and
volunteers into the classroom involves their authority.  Often the students in
a VE class do not respect the direction provided by someone other than their
teacher.  VE teachers must show the students that aides and volunteers have
their complete support.<P>

<i>Recognition for Effort  </i>It is strongly suggested that aides, volunteers
and peer support receive recognition on a regular basis. These individuals
should be reinforced for their efforts.  They should know that their efforts
have been valuable and have contributed to the development and progress of the
children they have helped.<P>

<h3><A NAME = "Teacher Aides">Teacher Aides</A></h3><P>

Teacher aides are members of the instructional staff at the school.  Some
districts use different titles for this job, but generally the aide's job is to
assist the teacher.  Duties may include administrative and clerical tasks,
arranging the classroom environment for learning, instruction-related
responsibilities, and supervisory activities with students.  <br>
<br>
<p>The teacher aide will need both knowledge and skill training to work
effectively in a VE classroom.  The school district, often in collaboration
with the regional FDLRS center, can make training available to teacher aides.
It is suggested that the aide be involved in an inservice training prior to
working with the  students in VE classes. This training should involve a basic
understanding of child growth and development and a general knowledge of
educational approaches to learning.  They will need to have an understanding of
the basic causes and characteristics of handicapping conditions for students
with whom they work.  They must understand the purpose of Individual
Educational Plans and how they are developed and carried out. <br>
<br>
<p>The specific duties of teacher aides varies from district to district.  Certain
restrictions may be placed on the range of duties assigned based on the source
of funding.  If aides are paid from federal IDEA funds, they may not provide
services to students who are not eligible for exceptional student education,
nor may they work with gifted students.  <P>

<h3><A NAME = "Volunteers">Volunteers</A></h3><P>

Volunteers are recruited from the community to assist in classrooms.  Most
districts and schools have an organized program to facilitate this effort.
However, volunteer programs may not always be utilized in VE classes.
Sometimes ESE teachers feel that volunteers may not be suited for their
programs.  This is certainly not true.  What is needed, is volunteer selection
and preparation procedures that insures their awareness of the characteristics
of the students in VE classesand their readiness to respond appropriately.

<p>In many situations, volunteers may have duties that are similar to those of the
teacher aides.  However, they usually have not been specifically trained for
their role and the time they have to spend in the classroom is generally more
limited.  The volunteer may assist with preparing materials for the classroom,
filing student work, and providing important personal contact with students.<br>

<p>It is suggested that volunteers spend some time in the classroom before
committing to the job. Training is also recommended to prepare volunteers to
work with the students appropriately.
<P>
<i>Where can volunteers be found?</i><P>

If you don't have a ready source of volunteers for your classroom, try
these sources:<P>
<ul>
<li>Church groups and service clubs in the community<P>
<li>Business partnerships who provide release time for employees to serve as
mentors and volunteers in school programs<<P>
<li>Senior-citizen groups<P>
<li>Community college and university training programs<<P>
</ul><P>

<h3><A NAME = "Peer Support">Peer Support</A></h3><P>

The use of students to provide assistance in the VE classroom benefits both the
ESE students and the student volunteers.  In some districts, older students
from nearby schools may earn credit by assisting in these classrooms.  Peer
support can also involve students from within the VE classroom or from regular
education classrooms in the school. The student assistant can provide
instructional assistance and be a positive social influence.<P>

<H4>Selection of Students for Peer Support</H4><P>

Peer support students can be selected by an interest survey and teacher
recommendation.  Some high school service clubs may be interested in sponsoring
a student assistance program.  It may be possible to recruit peer support
students from within the VE classroom.  Older, more mature students can serve
as respected role models.  Students will need structure and training to serve
effectively as a peer support.  The teacher should carefully select these
students. The factors that should be considered include reliability,
compatibility, behavior, and willingness to make a commitment.<P>

The following are examples of peer support programs that teachers in Florida
have used.<P>

<H4>Reading Buddies</H4><P>

Once a week ESE students meet with their reading buddies from first grade.
Each pair or threesome take turns reading their book to the other students.
This stimulates students' interest in reading as they have a direct, interested
audience. <P>

(from <i>Trina Cassidy, Orange County</i>)<P>

<H4>Mentors for Visually Impaired Students</H4><P>

Regular-education students are enrolled in a specially designed program
to assist visually impaired students in the mainstream setting.  As mentors,
they help the vision teacher by working with visually impaired high school
students and also travel to middle schools to provide reader services, large
print work, graphic details, and personal life experiences.  The regular
education students earn credit for their work.  Such a program can easily be
adapted for all types of students with disabilities. <P>

(from <i>Sandi Serventi, Leon County</i>) <P>

<H4>Peer Facilitators for the ESE Reading Program</H4><P>

A partnership between peer facilitators, ESE students, and teachers is
established to assist in the ESE reading program.  The peer facilitators are
specially chosen for patience, willingness, academic levels, character, and
dependability and work under the supervision of the guidance counselor.  ESE
students are chosen by reading level, desire to improve, and basic need, and
work under the supervision of the ESE teacher.  Peer facilitators and ESE
students work together to practice reading skills and enhance reading
abilities.  <P>
