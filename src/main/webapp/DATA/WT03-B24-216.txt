<P>Employees: 7,800</P>

<P>Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which was founded more than 100 years ago, in 1894, is a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer based in Japan. Building on its proud history, the Company is steadily expanding its operations around the globe. Fujisawa has approximately 7,800 employees working at its various facilities, including those of its subsidiaries, scattered all over the world.</P>

<P>Fujisawa's research and development expenses, equivalent to 12.8% of net sales during fiscal 1995, and the large share of its R&D staff, about 23% of all employees, clearly illustrate the Company's firm commitment to R&D. Based on its corporate philosophy, "Challenging the unknown frontier known as humans and contributing to healthier, more prosperous lives for people around the world," Fujisawa remains committed to vigorous R&D efforts in its quest for innovative pharmaceutical products with true clinical significance and to making them available in the global market.</P>

<P><B><I>Summary of Business Results</I></B><BR>
Consolidated net sales for fiscal 1995 came to Y284.0 billion(US$3,191 million), up 4.4% on the previous term. In addition to higher sales, we were able to cut production costs in Japan and overseas and to curtail various expenses through higher operational efficiency and economy. Income before taxes and net income, however, dropped to Y25.8 billion(US$290 million) and Y5.4 billion(US$60 million), respectively. These declines are attributable to the absence of such special revenue as recorded for the previous term.</P>

<P><B><I>Investment</I></B><BR>
Plant and equipment investment during the term totaled Y10.6 billion(US$120 million), which mainly went to the upgrading of synthesizing facilities at our Osaka and Takaoka Plants and to the partial reconstruction of our Exploratory Research Laboratories in Tsukuba.</P>

<P><B><I>R&D Activities</I></B><BR>
Treating research and development as a top priority, we continued with brisk investment, spending a total of Y36.5 billion(US$410 million), roughly the same amount as in the previous year and representing 12.8% of net sales.</P>

<P>Turning to Prograf, after the drug was approved in Japan for the supplemental indication of treatment of graft versus host diseases in bone marrow transplantation in July 1994, an NDA was filed for prophylaxis of rejection in kidney transplantation in September 1994.</P>

<P>In other developments on the R&D front, after obtaining approval for the human growth factor mecasermin, we launched the drug in February 1995 under the name of Somazon. In January 1995, we filed ad NDA for the injectable cephalosporin antibiotic cefoselis. Other products under NDA examination in Japan are the hypnotic agent zolpidem and the oral antipollakiuria agent vamicamide.</P>

<P><B><I>Fujisawa on the World Stage</I></B><BR>
Fujisawa's international strategy began to take shape with the licensing out to overseas companies of the parental cephalosporin antibiotic cefazolin (Cefamezin in Japan) in the early 1970s, with the licensees being such leading companies as then SmithKline & French, Eli Lilly, and then Bristol Myers. Today, although it no longer enjoys patent protection, cefazolin is still marketed in over 60 countries worldwide as a standard antibiotic for infectious diseases. Another internationally successful original Fujisawa product is the oral cephalosporin cefixime (Suprax in the US). Sold in over 50 countries, cefixime boasts substantial market shares, particularly in Europe.</P>

<P>In 1981, the Company established a joint venture company, Fujisawa SmithKline Corporation, with then SmithKline & French of the US for its parental cephalosporin antibiotic ceftizoxime(Cefizox in the US). We gained the experience of developing ceftizoxime for the US market, as well as producing and marketing it there. As a result, we decided to establish a direct presence abroad, and since then have laid the groundwork for our own development and marketing of drugs overseas.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, seeing a bright future for healthcare in the US, in 1985 we acquired a stake in Lyphomed, Inc. to have another base in the US. This was followed by a friendly takeover of Lyphomed in 1989, and Fujisawa SmithKline Corporation was renamed Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company. Similarly, we had acquired a stake in Klinge Pharma GmbH of Germany in 1983.</P>

<P>As the latest step in our international expansion directed at our own development of compounds and marketing in the world market, in April 1990 we merged Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company and Lyphomed into the new subsidiary Fujisawa USA, Inc., which operates, together with PMP Fermentation Products, Inc., under Fujisawa Holding Company. In November 1991 we established Fujisawa GmbH in Munich,  
Germany, with the aim of directly developing and marketing our immunosuppressant Prograf in the European market. In 1992, the Ireland Plant was completed for the formulation of Prograf for the European and US markets. Our current international strategy takes a two-pronged approach to drug development and marketing: through our own overseas subsidiaries on the one hand, and through licensing alliances with active overseas companies on the other.</P>

<P><B><I>Review of Operations</I></B><BR>
Consolidated sales in fiscal 1995 amounted to Y284.0 billion(US$3,191 million), up 4.4% on the previous term. Net income for the term, however, dropped 26.3% to Y5.4 billion(US$60 million). Looking at results by area, sales in Japan came to Y242.3 billion(US$2,723 million), in the US to Y22.6 billion(US$254 million), in Europe to Y17.0 billion(US$191 million), and in Asia to Y2.1 billion(US$23 million), accounting for 85.3%, 8.0%, 6.0% and 0.7% of total sales respectively.</P>
