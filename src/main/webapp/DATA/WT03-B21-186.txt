			<FONT SIZE=+1>First Quarter</FONT><BR>
			<UL>
				<LI>TVX Gold poured the foundation for the mill at its 50% owned New Britannia project near Snow Lake, Manitoba, maintaining construction and shaft sinking on schedule, with a view to commencing production in the fourth quarter.
				<LI>The Company increased its interest in the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic to 100% and anticipates proving up reserves of one million ounces by year end. The 1995 exploration program includes underground development and surface and underground drifting.
				<LI>The Company was named the winning bidder for the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece, proposing to purchase the assets for $46 million. After completion of a new autoclave plant, Kassandra is expected to produce in excess of 300,000 gold equivalent ounces annually in the initial years of full production and 200,000 ounces annually thereafter.

			<FONT SIZE=+2>Q2<BR></FONT>
			<FONT SIZE=+1>Second Quarter</FONT><BR>
			<UL>
				<LI>The Company acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha gold-silver deposit located in South Kamchatka, Russia and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100%, subject to compliance with Russian laws. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work shows that a substantial amount of the identified reserve contains free gold and recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes.
				<LI>TVX Gold's share of gold equivalent from the La Coipa mine was 55,900 ounces in the second quarter compared to 49,800 ounces in the second quarter of 1994. Cash costs per ounce were $156 compared to $160 for the same period in 1994.
			</UL>
			<FONT SIZE=+2>Q3<BR></FONT>
			<FONT SIZE=+1>Third Quarter</FONT><BR>
			<UL>
				<LI>At the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project, the construction of a 45 kilometre all-weather access road was completed while exploration and feasibility studies continued. A production decision was made in the first quarter of 1996.
				<LI>The underground exploration drifting program at the Kasperske Hory project was expanded after achieving better than expected productivity in the second quarter.
				<LI>At the Company's Mineral Hill mine, a new ore zone was discovered down dip and adjacent to the existing Mineral Hill orebody. This new Ski Slope zone will be brought into production in the second quarter of 1996 supplementing output from the Mineral Hill deposit.
				<LI>At New Britannia, the Company's construction schedule remained on target. The primary crusher building and the installation of mill equipment were completed by mid-September. The mine was visited by the Honourable Gary Filmon, Premier of Manitoba.

			<FONT SIZE=+1>Forth Quarter</FONT><BR>
			<UL>
				<LI>TVX Gold officially opened the New Britannia mine on November 14. At full capacity the mill will produce 100,000 ounces of gold per year.
				<LI>On December 21, TVX Gold announced the closing of its acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. The Company made an initial payment of $19 million and will make a further payment of approximately $27 million, payable in five equal annual installments plus interest.
