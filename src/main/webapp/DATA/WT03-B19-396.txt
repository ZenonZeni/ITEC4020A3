<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 212</TITLE>

<H1>The climate policy of<BR>
the Group of Seven (G-7)</H1>
<HR>
<B>Environmental matters are increasingly prominent on the agenda of the G-7’s 
annual Economic Summits. </B>In 1990, the Heads of State or Government of the 
Group of Seven leading industrial states (G-7)1 noted that "one of our most important 
responsibilities is to pass on to future generations an environment whose health, beauty, 
and economic potential are not threatened". This marks an important transition from the 
traditional stance, which gave overriding priority to economic growth. <P>
<B>The Economic Declarations of the last five Summit meetings all stress the need 
to integrate environmental considerations into economic activities.</B> They also 
include concrete proposals and commitments on various environmental issues, including 
climate change. Although these declarations do not have legal force, they do indicate the 
group’s level of political will for dealing with environmental problems. <P>
<B>The G-7 first highlighted climate change at its 1988 Toronto Economic 
Summit.</B> The Summit welcomed the convening of <A HREF = 
"fs215.html">the Toronto Conference on the Changing 
Atmosphere </A>as well as the establishment of <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)</A>.<P>
<B>The 1989 Paris Economic Summit (Summit of the Arch) stressed the need to 
reduce emissions of <A HREF = "fs002.html">greenhouse 
gases</A>. </B>The Summit Declaration noted that industry has a crucial role to play in 
preventing environmental degradation. It addressed the issue of financial and technical 
assistance to developing countries to help them cope with environmental problems, and it 
advocated economic incentives such as the use of aid mechanisms and technology 
transfers for specific environmental projects. It stated that in special cases, debt 
forgiveness and "debt-for-nature swaps" can play a useful role in environmental 
protection. The declaration also contained a catalogue of environmental problems 
requiring action by G-7 members and by the international community. Problems relating to 
changes in the atmosphere figure prominently on this list. The declaration supports the 
work of the IPCC, and stresses the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
increasing <A HREF = "fs240.html">energy efficiency</A>. 
Another important aim is to preserve forests, as deforestation also damages the 
atmosphere.<P>
<B>The 1990 Houston Economic Summit emphasized the role of industrial 
countries in protecting the environment. </B>Declared the G-7 heads, "We as 
industrialized countries have an obligation to be leaders in meeting these challenges. We 
agree that, in the face of threats of irreversible environmental damage, lack of full 
scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in their own right". 
Stating that "climate change is of key importance", the Summit declaration expressed the 
G-7’s commitment to undertaking common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases 
such as carbon dioxide (CO2). Unlike some other conference statements, however, the 
declaration did not set specific emissions targets. It repeated the earlier support of the <A 
HREF = "fs209.html">UN-sponsored negotiations on a climate 
treaty</A>, welcomed the decision of the parties to <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol</A> to phase out 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000, and emphasized the need for forest 
conservation, on which the G-7 members declared themselves "determined to take 
action".<P>
<B>The 1991 London Economic Summit supported UNCED. </B>The G-7 members 
reiterated their previous stance and placed special emphasis on the preparations for the 
1992 <A HREF = "fs207.html">United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED)</A>. They stressed their aim to achieve, in 
time for UNCED, "an effective framework convention on climate change, containing 
appropriate commitments and addressing all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases", and 
to expedite work on implementing protocols to reinforce the convention. They declared 
their intention to promote the mobilization of funds to help developing countries tackle 
environmental problems, using existing mechanisms for this purpose. Support was also 
expressed for "an improved flow of beneficial technology" to developing countries.<P>
<B>The 1992 Munich Economic Summit called for decisive action to follow-up on 
the results of UNCED</B>. The G-7 members urged all states to incorporate sustainable 
development and the interests of present and future generations into their policy-making. 
The Summit also specifically called for the ratification of the newly signed <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change</A> by the end of 1993.<P>
<B>	Notes:</B><P>
	1  The G-7 members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US. <P>
