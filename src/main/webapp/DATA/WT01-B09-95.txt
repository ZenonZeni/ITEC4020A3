<B>Project Title:  San Francisco Bay Area Station Car Program<p>

Performing Organization:  Bay Area Rapid Transit District
	
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Victoria Nerenberg  (510) 869-2416</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>The Electric Station Car program creates the nation's first and largest fleet of "station cars," multi-user electric vehicles dedicated for use commuting to or from a transit station, such as a rail stop.  Station cars provide multimodal flexibility to transit, while encouraging ridership and providing a clean door-to-door commute.  Station cars also provide an early market for EVs.  A total of 40 station cars will operate out of several BART stations.</P>

<P>Two-passenger, purpose-built electric cars, designed to be manufactured in the United States starting in 1997, will be used in this project.  The initial delivery of 12 vehicles in 1995 will have a range of approximately 65 miles and a top speed of 55 mph.
</P>
	<P>The balance of 28 purpose-built vehicles will be upgraded for a top speed of 65 mph and a range of 70-90 miles.  These cars are designed around a lightweight aluminum space frame, with a fully recyclable thermoplastic body.  The cars will be powered by an AC drive train and either lead-acid or nickel-cadmium batteries.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>	

<P>A multiple-vehicle charging kiosk has been installed.  Eight station cars were delivered in October 1995, with four additional cars supplied to the program in January 1996.  The remaining 28 vehicles will be delivered to BART in the late summer of 1996.</P>
