<center><h1>Synopsis of Programming Projects</h1></center><p>
<p>
<h2>VMS Systems Projects</h2><p>
<p>
<h3>SRAM Memory Test System</h3><p>
During the fabrication of the 
<a href="/~rlehmer/camac/camac_pic.html">GL_AD1020 custom waveform
recorders</a>, it was
determined that a number of small daughter PC boards used for the memory
subsystem were defective.  In order to isolate which memory boards were
defective, a test jig with parallel data and address lines and a clock and
strobe system was built.  The jig was driven by a DRQ3B high performance
parallel interface card installed in a MicroVAX II.  All of the driver code for
the test was developed in house using QIO calls to the card, as well as the
sorting procedure to determine the severity of the memory failures.<p>
<p>
<h2>CAMAC Systems Projects</h2><p>
<p>
<h3>Development of Non-standard CAMAC module drivers into MDS</h3><p>
The MDS data acquisition provided the hooks to allow user written CAMAC module
drivers to be included in the standard high level MDS interface.  For the
diagnostic work at DIII-D, drivers for scalers and clock modules not supported
in MDS was required.  Using templates from MDS written in 
<a href="/htbin/helpgate/HELP/FORTRAN">FORTRAN</a>, the modules'
actions can be scripted.  In addition, CASE tools such as 
<a href="/htbin/helpgate/HELP/CMS">CMS</a> and 
<a href="/htbin/helpgate/HELP/CDD_PLUS">CDD</a> are
required to correctly build the drivers and the user interface is configured
using the TDMS forms package.<p>
<p>
<h3>Development of Custom 20MHz Waveform Recorders for the PISCES</h3><p>
In addition to leading 
<a href="/~rlehmer/camac/camac_pic.html">the design and 
fabrication program to assemble the 64
channel A/D system</a>, the development of the MDS user interface was critical in
verifying the functionality of the digitizing system. Critical testing included
the testing of clock and gain settings,  operation of the stop trigger system
and post trigger counters, and data integrity.  FORTRAN codes and some MDS
scripts were used to provide a rudimentary test interface for the engineering
team to test each function of the digitizing system.<p>
<p>
<h3>Installation of Hytec Ethernet Crate Controllers at PISCES Lab</h3><p>
Development of new CAMAC management software (ECCTS) compatible with Hytec ECC
software.  Based user interface on original CTS (CAMAC Topology Server)
developed by ORNL, however, converted logical name management to be compatible
with new software environment.  Also provided privileged user interface to
starting and stopping Hytec ECC communication software.<p>
<p>
In addition, a problem with the Ethernet hardware of the Hytec Controllers
precluded their use in a fiber optic Ethernet network that included a repeater.
Was able to evaluate network problem and determine that upgraded controllers
were necessary.<p>
<p>
<h3>Installation of Hytec Ethernet Crate Controllers at DIII-D Tokamak</h3><p>
Similar software/hardware integration environment, however, some CAMAC
modules used on Langmuir probe diagnostics were affected by presence of an
enabled Inhibit line on the CAMAC dataway.  Determined by testing that modules
were operating normally and that Hytec default configuration is to enable the
I-line, rather than ORNL software, that disables it.  Wrote software that
disables I-line on ECC whenever controllers are reset by user action.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2>World Wide Web Experience</h2><p>
<p>
<h3>WWW Server Configuration and Management</h3><p>
<b></b>Experience with 
<a href="http://www.er6.eng.ohio-state.edu/www/doc/serverinfo.html">OSU 
HTTP</a>, <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu">NCSA httpd</a>, and MacHTTP Servers, including
rules and mapping configuration and security considerations.  As Webmaster,
generated a majority of server content from existing promotional material and
scientific reports.  Provided support to other users in group in their
production of WWW material.  Monitored server accesses and generated reports.<p>
<p>
<h3>CGI Programming</h3><p>
<b></b>Experience using CGI scripts to generate 
<a href="/www/railroads/metrolink.html">Metrolink commuter train
schedules</a> on the fly.  Other CGI scripts give user-customized information about
station locator maps and connecting transit information.<p>
<p>
<h3>WWW Content Production</h3><p>
Two major projects: 
<a href="/www/pisces/pisces.html">PISCES Lab Outreach Project</a> 
and <a href="/www/railroads/railroads.html">Southern California
Railroad Resources</a>.  The PISCES Lab Outreach Project involved the conversion of
existing progress report material to HTML.  In addition, 
<a href="/www/beryllium/beryllium.html">the Beryllium Safety
System in the PISCES Lab</a> requires a variety of material updated on a regular
basis as well as 
<a href="/www/beryllium/be-cam.html">a real-time digital camera</a> of the facility.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Analysis Applications Programming</h2><p>
<p>
<h3>FLCTRNS - A Plasma Turbulence Analysis Package</h3><p>
Originally written in FORTRAN with no graphical user interface, the
FLCTRNS code was rewritten in <a href="http://www.rsinc.com">IDL</a> (a 4GL programming language) to provide an
intuitive X windows graphical interface.  FLCTRNS takes digitized data from an
array of Langmuir probes and computes auto and cross power spectra, wavenumber
and coherency spectra, dispersion relations S(k,f), and an estimation of the
transport of plasma particles due to the turbulent fluctuations.  Additional
modules have been added for analyzing non-time stationary behavior in the
turbulence using the Wavelet transform.  The modular nature of FLCTRNS has
allowed for the simultaneous support of the program at five different
facilities running three different underlying database packages.<p>
<p>
<h3>Time Domain Visualization of Density Structures</h3><p>
One of the major diagnostics in the turbulence measurements at PISCES
Lab is an array of Langmuir probes arranged in an 8 by 8 array.  Thus,
turbulence at 64 spatial locations is recorded simultaneously.  One method for
analyzing the intermittent turbulent behavior in the plasma is to assemble
movies of the density fluctuations, using IDL to extract data from the database
and generate shaded color contour plots of the fluctuation levels.  The color
contour plots are then converted to PICT files and transferred to a Macintosh
to generate Quicktime movies of the time dependent motion of the intermittent
density blobs in the plasma.<p>
<p>
<h3>Other Analysis Codes</h3><p>
Maintained and enhanced other analysis codes, including Langmuir probe
analysis codes for single, double, and triple probes.  Developed tools to infer
electric field magnitude and shear from emissive probe measurements of the
plasma space potential.  Maintained automated codes that compute the operating
point of power supplies, gas feed systems, and other user specified settings.<p>
