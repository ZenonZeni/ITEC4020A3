<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">Dear Friend,</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i><u>You are receiving this letter because you
are a person who can appreciate solid investment results and an effective
risk-management discipline</u></i><i>.</i> Most likely, you are
more successful in your endeavors when you can focus on your
goals. Therefore, following the market, which is terribly
time-intensive, probably only serves to distract you from what
you do best &#150; running your business, enjoying your
retirement, or sharing quality time with your family. That&#146;s
why the <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em> is the
perfect investment tool for managing your portfolio with
virtually no effort.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>YOU</b> are the reason I created the <em><strong>Hot
Funds Analyst</strong></em>! </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1995-96, my <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>
model portfolios are up an average of </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>67.56%.</b></font><font size="3">
Year-to-date, portfolios are up an average of 16.60%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Wingdings">q</font><font size="3"> If
you'd invested $100,000 in our <b>Index Fund Portfolio</b> in
January last year, as I advised, your investment would now be
worth $170,150, <i>a gain of over 70%.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Wingdings">q</font><font size="3"> Your
$100,000 investment in the <b>No-Load Growth Portfolio</b> would
have turned into $171,830, <i>a gain of almost 72%.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Wingdings">q</font><font size="3"> Your
$100,000 investment in the Fidelity Sector Portfolio would have
rocketed to $179,660, just shy of <i>an 80% increase</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>But best of all, you&#146;d have done this </b><b><u>without</u></b><b>
taking big risks or investing or speculative stocks. </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">On June 10<sup>th</sup>, you&#146;d have been
out of the market in plenty of time to avoid the sharp decline
while everyone else was sucked into a whirlpool of diminishing
assets.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">How have I been able to do this, particularly
in a year when most advisors and mutual funds were having such a
tough time just keeping up with the broad market averages like
the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b><i>Simply by using the TWO
MOST POWERFUL INVESTMENT PROGRAMS available today!</i></b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">If you are interested in lowering your risk in
the Stock Market and at the same time easily doubling your money
every 3-4 years, please read this letter very carefully. How can
YOU make my systems yield </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><u>speedy,
significant growth</u></font><font size="3"> of your capital? Let
me tell you...</font></p>

<p><font size="3">You are not alone. Investors all across America
are struggling with how to control risk in their portfolios and
still capture the rewards of the stock market. Finally there is a
solution that's proven, simple, and costs about </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><u>$12 a month</u>.</font><font size="3"> Like
our other readers, you too can lower your risk and boost returns
by knowing when to sell.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><i>Great service! My kids have you to thank for
their college education!!! -- Steele Campbell</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3">These investors are following the mutual fund
investing strategy that has captured every bull market <u>and avoided
every bear market since 1963</u>. By avoiding the damaging
effects of bear markets in stocks you will be able to lower the
risk in your portfolio by as much as 50%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Unlike the majority of fund investors who
follow a dangerous buy-and-hold strategy, our investors sidestep
devastating market declines and bear markets, allowing them to
safely and steadily make money over the long term.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">Knowing when to sell to take
profits, and when to buy to earn more profits</font><font
size="3">, are two reasons our subscribers make more money than
investors following other investment strategies. Our subscribers commit
a larger percentage of their capital because our investment plan
is easy to understand and simple to follow.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Simplicity means you can actually follow it day
in and day out, year after year, and thus benefit from long-term compounding.
Our subscribers stay committed because our plan has proved safe
in over thirty years of testing and trading. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">Safety gives you peace of mind, enables
you to sleep at night, lets you enjoy investing, while you watch
your money grow and compound into the fortune you desire.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">But most importantly, simplicity and safety
combine to provide a high degree of comfort. Comfort is the most
important ingredient of any investment plan, because with your
serious money at stake, you won't tolerate anything difficult,
risky, stressful, or discomforting!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the other hand, if you have a simple plan,
and a safe plan, and you feel comfortable using it, then you'll
stick with it over the long-term. By sticking with it over the
long-term, you'll reap the benefits of long term compounding,
which in turn will give you the wealth you desire.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Simplicity, safety, and comfort are the three
ingredients to investment success. Our subscribers enjoy all
three and thus commit a much larger percentage of their
investment capital. Finally, because the</font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"> <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>'s
investment plan is very profitable,</font><font size="3"> the
larger commitment brings greater profits.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">With our plan they enjoy a new investment
lifestyle -- one that does not interfere with their day-to-day lives.
And one that they know they'll be able to use long into the
future.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Now you can stop looking for that elusive
investment strategy, because you've just found it. Let me show
you how you can make 20% every year, with very little risk.</u></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">Making 20% a year will double
your money every 3-4 years.</font><font size="3"> That means you
can </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><i>quadruple</i></font><font
size="3"> your money in the next 7 years. If you aren't
consistently earning 20% or more on your investments, then what
you are about to learn may dramatically change your financial
life. Earning 20% on your money, though not easy, is still
possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">But first, you have to rid your investment
program of hot tips and hunches and start applying the </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">mathematical and scientifically
probabilistic</font><font size="3"> approach pioneered here at
Vital Information. Why risk your hard earned money, when you can
protect it using our timing model?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is our pleasure to introduce you to the <em><strong>Hot
Funds Analyst</strong></em></font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">,</font><font
size="3"> providing investment picks that will lead to wealth accumulation
and financial independence in a surprisingly short amount of
time. It is the amazing source that shows you how to begin the
long-term, systematic, month-by-month, year-by-year relentless
accumulation of wealth.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>
specifically tells you when to be in the stock market and when to
be out. Furthermore, it tells you which mutual funds to put your
money in today. It will show you the most favorable mutual funds,
sector funds and index funds for the prevailing market
conditions. It does all the financial homework to tell you </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><i><u>what to buy, when to buy and when
to sell.</u></i></font></p>

<p><font size="3">But before I continue, let me introduce myself.
My name is JAY SAXENA and I bring you many years of sound, proven
investment experience as one of the nation's most successful

and a master's degree in </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><i>Computer Science</i></font><font
size="3"> and years of investment experience under my belt, I've
seen a lot of investment strategies come and go.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">But it wasn't until I developed my own system
that I discovered how to consistently identify mutual funds that
gave me quick profits that I secretly hoped for. In a moment, I

<p><font size="3">The </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">INDEX

Funds (1-800-820-0888). By using these funds (Nova, OTC and Ursa)
you can go both long and short depending on market conditions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><u>Rydex Nova</u></font><font
size="3"> is an S&amp;P500 index fund with a beta of 1.5. This
means when you invest in the Nova fund and it goes up, you make
50% <i>more</i> than the S&amp;P500 index itself. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><u>Rydex OTC</u></font><font size="3">
is an index fund that tracks the NASDAQ index. The combination of
Rydex Nova and OTC, lets us participate in both the large and the
small-cap stocks.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Rydex is only family that offers a fund that is
short the S&amp;P500. This makes </font><font color="#FF0000"
size="3"><u>Rydex Ursa</u></font><font size="3"> a rather unique
fund. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">It goes up when the
S&amp;P500 goes down </font><font size="3">and vice-versa. This
means you make money as the S&amp;P500 goes down. If you are able
to find other similar funds, you may be able to substitute them for
the Rydex funds. Jack White and Company offers all three Rydex
funds while Charles Schwab offers only the Nova fund.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">NO-LOAD
GROWTH PORTFOLIO</font><font size="3"> consists of no-load funds
that can be bought and sold through Charles Schwab &amp; Company
(1-800-2-NO-LOAD), Jack White &amp; Company (1-800-233-3411) or
Fidelity FundsNetwork (1-800-544-7777). This portfolio comprises
of funds from excellent families like Twentieth Century, Janus,
Invesco, Berger, Steinroe, Founders, Oakmark, Lexington,
Robertson Stephens, PBHG, Benham, Neuberger &amp; Berman, T. Rowe
Price, Montgomery, Strong, Dreyfus and many more.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">FIDELITY
GROWTH PORTFOLIO</font><font size="3"> consists of Fidelity
non-sector diversified equity funds. Some Fidelity funds have a <i>one
time</i> 3% sales load. After that you may switch to other funds
within the family without any loads or fees. Call Fidelity

It!</u></i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font><font
color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>MAGNIFICENT MARKET TIMING</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Market timing has been the one, forever, secret
of investment success. In all markets. In all times. All investments
have their cycles, periods when prices rise and periods when they
fall. <u>The idea is to buy </u><i><u>before</u></i><u> prices
rise and to sell </u><i><u>before</u></i><u> prices fall.</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opportunities abound. But only if you buy and
if you sell at the right time. This is where we come in ... the <em><strong>Hot
Funds Analyst</strong></em>specializes in stock market timing! We
tell you what, as well as when, to buy and sell.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Studies have shown that for a typical stock or
equity fund, 60% of the price movement can be directly attributed
to the movement of the overall market. Therefore, it is extremely
important to stay on the right side of the overall market trend. It
is important to know the current phase of the market, and when it
is ready to change direction.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Vital Information's </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><i><u>Best Intermediate-Term Timing
System</u></i> (BITS) provides a disciplined, objective and
scientific approach to timing the market, </font><font size="3">free
of bias and emotion. It uses an arsenal of the finest stock
market indicators available, organized into a complex set of
rules, to automatically signal stock market tops and bottoms.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">BITS is based on a mathematical model that
automatically locates situations that have historically predicted
stock market moves resulting in excellent buying and selling
opportunities. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">It has an excellent track
record of accurately signaling market turns.</font><font size="3">
We never predict. Instead we follow the trend of the market. We
prefer to be prepared, so that when a market comes along, we can
simply sidestep it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Frequently, you read in the financial press the
opinion that timing doesn't work. This myth is perpetuated by
those who have failed to develop a sound timing system. If you
were to study the long-term charts of stock market prices, you would
discover that the market moves up and down in trends, over a
period of months, or even years.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>You are the best. I am a new subscriber and
I&#146;m excited. The calls you&#146;ve made this year are next
to being clairvoyant. The market is down today, big time, and
I&#146;m not just out but in Ursa. What a thrill. You are the best.
Keep up the great work. &#150; A. Murray</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Even though the market moves sideways at times,
this motion is always temporary. Most of the time, the market is
in the process of going up, or it is in the process of going
down. The <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>'s plan </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">follows the trend of the market,
capturing the biggest part of any uptrend, and dodging the
biggest part of any downtrend.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When we dodge the downtrends, </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">we dodge bear markets.</font><font
size="3"> Any downtrend has the potential to turn into a serious
bear market. The reason we make more money than buy-and-hold
investors is because we don't have to make up for bear market
losses when the market starts advancing again.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If you are a buy-and-hold investor, you'll
capture the advances but you won't necessarily profit from them,
since you'll be making up for your bear market losses. For
example, buy-and-hold investors who captured 1991's big advance merely
made up losses from 1990's big decline.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Even more chilling, consider the bear market of
1973-74. If you had invested $10,000 in a stock index fund on
January 2, 1973, your investment would have shrunk to $5,180 over
the next 21 months -- a 48.20% decline. After this loss, you
would have had to hold your investment more than seven and a half
years just to make up your losses and break-even with your
initial $10,000 investment.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The important thing to understand is that
market advances are for getting your money to grow, not for making
up past losses. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">The key is
knowing the trend of the market</font><font size="3">, so that
you can dodge the bear markets and capture the advances that
follow them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>The </u><em><strong><u>Hot Funds Analyst</u></strong></em><u>
will clearly show you whether the intermediate-term trend of the
market is up or down and whether you should be long or in cash.</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">If you had followed this system from 7/1/63 to
10/31/96, a mutual fund that closely tracks the NASDAQ index, you would
have made a </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>25.14%
annualized return</b>.</font><font size="3"> This performance
beats all others and has outperformed the popular buy-and-hold
approach to stock fund investing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One question we are often asked is, </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">&quot;How did your market timing model
do during the crash of 1987?&quot;.</font><font size="3"> You'd
notice that BITS not only side-stepped the crash of 1987, but
also the mini crash of 1989 and the market decline of 1990. Then
it signaled the powerful upmove of 1991.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Consider the performance of BITS in recent
years. On 10/07/92, BITS identified a strong market uptrend and
we switched from the safety of money-market funds into stock
funds. While thousands of investors sat waiting on the sidelines
until the market climbed higher, we got into the market quickly and
saw our funds steadily generate profits. In contrast, many
investors were still entering the already overvalued market as
late as February 1994.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><i><u>Before</u></i></font><font
size="3"> the market corrected sharply in March 1994, our system
identified a new downtrend and we switched back to the safety of
money market funds. In December 1994, many investors were too jittery
to invest in the stocks market, fearing another down move.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">However, BITS gave us a buy signal on December
27, 1994 and we got invested in stock funds. Guess what? While our
portfolios are up over 40% in 1995, the other investors missed
another big advance. Buy-and-hold investors, of course, are
making up for their 1994 losses. We, on the other hand, made </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>67.56%</b> for our readers</font><font
size="3"> in 1995-96.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The reason our system works better than
buy-and-hold (and pray!) is that it mechanically identifies the trends.
As a result, <u>you know when to be in the market and when to be
out.</u> No other piece of information is more important.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our research shows that investing in equities
during market uptrends, then switching to money funds during
market downtrends, could safely produce 20-25% annualized
compounded growth. Today we can say that anyone committing to our
plan for two years or more dramatically reduces stock market risk.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Bear markets are inevitable, like death and
taxes. Sooner or later a major one will strike, cutting the portfolio
values of buy-and-hold investors into half. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">But, by using the signals from BITS, you
will be able to get out in time </font><font color="#FF0000"
size="3" face="Symbol">-</font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"> <i><u>for maximum
profits!</u></i></font><font size="3"> That's because BITS
presages all new bull and bear markets, allowing you to get into
the market at major bottoms, and exit the market right at the top before
the downturn starts.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">And you never have to worry about surprise
shifts in the market robbing you of your profits, because BITS is specifically
designed to give you a wide margin of advance notice whenever the market
is ready to turn. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">How Successful
Has It Been? Judge For Yourself... </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Following the above signals and investing in a
mutual fund that closely tracks the NASDAQ index (for example the Rydex
OTC Fund) would have </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">turned
a one-time investment of $1000 into<b> $1,639,304.</b></font><font
size="3"> The same $1000 invested using a buy &amp; hold approach
would have yielded <i>$36,322.</i> Past performance, of course,
is no guarantee of future results. The period 1963 to 1988 shows hypothetical results
from computer backtesting of our market timing models. The timing
system has been in real-time use since November 1988.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">BITS was developed in late 1988 and was tested
on historical data from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and the
S&amp;P500 index were used to generate the buy/sell signals and
compute the returns. Since 1989, BITS has been in use real-time and
it has proven itself in both backtesting and actual trading. On
average it signals a trade every 7 months. The accuracy rating is
80%, with every 4 out of 5 winning trades. The compounded
annualized return is </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>25.14%</b></font><font
size="3"> per year. There are a number of reasons why we are
using the Rydex family of funds for trading BITS signals.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><u>Rydex Nova</u></font><font
size="3"> is an S&amp;P500 index fund with a beta of 1.5. This
means when BITS is correct in its long signal, you make 50% <i>more</i>
than the S&amp;P500 index itself. </font><font color="#FF0000"
size="3"><u>Rydex OTC</u></font><font size="3"> is the only index
fund that tracks the Nasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Nova
and OTC when BITS is long, lets us participate in both the large
and the small-cap stocks. Rydex is only family that offers a fund
that is short the S&amp;P500. This makes </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><u>Rydex Ursa</u></font><font size="3">
a rather unique fund. <i>It goes up when the S&amp;P500 goes down</i>
and vice-versa. This means when BITS is correct in its cash/short
signal you make money as the S&amp;P500 goes down.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>THE AMAZING
POWER OF COMPOUNDING</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Long-term compounding is your single most
powerful wealth building tool, and its free. But to make it work,
you've got to keep your money growing. That's why it is so
important to get out of the market during the downtrends.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Over time, compounding converts small
amounts of money into enormous sums. For instance, if you invested
$4,000 a year (the amount you and your spouse could put into two
IRAs) in an investment earning 20%, in ten years your money would
grow to $128,601. After 20 years, your investment would be worth
$900,102. And get ready, because in 25 years, </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">you'd have a whopping <b>$2,269,509!</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">With long-term compounding, you don't have to
do anything fancy. You don't have to take unnecessary risks. The whole
idea is not to interfere with compounding. Just make steady gains
and let compounding work its magic!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">However, compounding takes time, and if you
don't have a simple and safe plan, you won't feel comfortable
investing your serious money over the long term. What's more, if
your plan does not put you safely on the sidelines during bear markets,
you'll lose money and ruin the good work compounding has started
for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Let me now tell you how our investment plan
works. Once you see how simple it is -- how it keeps your money growing
-- you'll understand why <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>
subscribers are able to commit their money and stick with it over the
long term.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>HERE'S HOW
OUR INVESTMENT PLAN WORKS</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The BITS market timing system was created out
of hard facts. It is a scientific system that has proven its
validity after decades of testing and investing. It does one
thing and one thing only, and </font><font color="#FF0000"
size="3">it does this one thing very well: <i><u>it identifies market
trends.</u></i></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The system has just two trading rules: one for
buying and one for selling. There are no gray areas. We use a
complex mathematical formula. We apply our formula to the major
market averages and other stock market statistics like new highs
and new lows. This reveals the trend of the market. An uptrend is
a buy signal, and a downtrend is a sell signal. That's all there
is to it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We use mutual funds as our investment vehicles.
I am sure I don't have to explain the merits of mutual funds.
Today, nearly everybody knows that mutual funds are superior in
every way: management, performance, safety, costs, and trading
convenience.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">We profit from the uptrends by
investing in growth funds, but during the downtrends we protect
our profits by switching to money market funds.</font><font
size="3"> As soon as the downtrend is over, and a new uptrend begins,
we switch back to growth funds. Our trading is easily handled
over the phone with just a few calls per year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Once you start reading the <em><strong>Hot
Funds Analyst</strong></em>, you'll always know the trend of the
market, and what action to take for both profit and safety. Since
1963, our market timing system (BITS) has identified every major
trend in the market. During this time, we moved in and out of the
market on average every 7 months.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We never labored over a buy decision. We never
labored over a sell decision. We never lost any sleep. We always knew
what to do. Deciding when to buy and sell is the most agonizing
part of investing. It can be emotionally wrenching. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">But our investment plan completely
eliminates emotional decision-making. It mechanically provides
buy and sell signals, and that makes it near fool-proof.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have never seen a simpler, safer, or more
comfortable way to keep your money growing and compounding. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">And once you see how easy it is to make
money this way (by following the trends), you will no longer care
why the market goes up or down.</font><font size="3"> The market
always goes up or down, and its a good thing it does, because
that's how we keep making money.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Time and again we hear from subscribers whose
only regret is that they did not find us sooner. Newcomers, of
course, are always skeptical. The plan does seem too good to be
true. But as you can see from the trades on page 7-9, the plan
works.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>In fact it works like crazy. Plain and
simple. No wonder it has an average yearly return of almost 25% over
the last 33 years.</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now you know how our simple investment plan
works. And, I think you can see how it can work for you. All you
need are 10 minutes a month and a desire to simplify and enrich
your life.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>HOW TO FOLLOW
OUR INVESTMENT PLAN?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">As I said earlier, with our investment plan,
you'll learn a new method of investing, an investment lifestyle
you'll be able to use to build all the wealth you want. And yet,
it's so simple to use, it won't interfere with your family or
work.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">It takes just 10 minutes a
month to use this system.</font><font size="3"> You'll invest in
equity funds when the stock market shows an uptrend. And you will
stay invested only as long as the uptrend continues. When the
uptrend is broken and turns down, you'll call your mutual fund
company and switch to the safety of their money market fund</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">We will tell you which mutual
funds to use.</font><font size="3"> You can choose between
today's best mutual funds and take advantage of the profits that
the stock market offers. If you prefer, you can make your own mutual
fund selections and use our market timing system (BITS) solely to
identify market trends (buy and sell signals). The information
you need is in our monthly newsletter and on our 24-hour Telephone Hotline.
It's as simple as that.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">Do you get the picture?</font><font
size="3"> This is a plan you can actually follow. One you'll feel
comfortable using everyday, for the rest of your life. No
guesswork. No emotional decision-making. No complex, time-consuming
strategies. No sales commissions. No conflicting reports in the
financial press to fret and worry over. Just a comfortable plan
for building wealth and increasing your spendable income!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>CLEAR CUT BUY
AND SELL SIGNALS</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">We monitor over 300 mutual funds, all with
switching privileges, which lets us move from the profitable equity
funds to the safety of money-market funds with one phone call. We
always list the top performing funds along with their 1 month, 3
month, 6 month and 12 month returns.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">But even more important than knowing which
funds to use, </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">you'll know
when to buy and when to sell.</font><font size="3"> That way you can
profit from the uptrends and you can save your profits from the
downtrends, including bear markets.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We screen hundreds of no and low load mutual
funds using our unique scoring system to zero in on the best of
the best. Not only do we analyze their past performance, but also
evaluate the likelihood of superior future performance by weighing
all available fundamental and technical information.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The top performing funds in any given period
always </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><i>outperform</i></font><font
size="3"> the market averages. Even when the market as a whole is
going down, some funds make huge gains. But fund leadership is
constantly changing. You have to know which funds to get into,
and when to get out. The <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>
gives you this information in clear and specific terms.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The bottom line is that </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">you'll always know where to invest your
money</font><font size="3"> because you'll always know which
mutual funds are on top. Many surveys tell you which mutual fund
did best last year. What you need to know is which funds will do best
in the future &#151; and this is what the <em><strong>Hot Funds
Analyst</strong></em> will do for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>
takes the sudden volatility out of investing. It means you don't
have to constantly watch and worry about timing your investments. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3">Successful fund investing means sticking
with the winners only when the trend is upwards; not buying and
holding (and praying!).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The drawback of a &quot;buy &amp; hold&quot;
approach is that in down markets your fund may lose as much as 50%
of its value. At that point it would have to gain at least 100%
just to break even. And that might take a long, long time. One
thing is quite clear : you'll make more money by side-stepping market corrections.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We rely on a rational, disciplined approach.
When the market begins to advance, our indicators generate a buy
signal, prompting a move into stock funds. They also flag the
downturns and generate a sell signal, so we're safely in money market
funds. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">Steady, consistent
growth is the hallmark of our safe and methodical approach.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We are systematic about following trends that
pay off with significant gains in the long run. There's no guesswork.
We don't try to predict the next move in the market at random.
Instead we focus on detecting trends and reacting appropriately.
The system of switching between top-ranked stock funds and money
market funds provides the flexibility needed to respond to
changing market conditions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>
will </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">enhance and safeguard
your portfolio with winning strategies and give you a low-risk, practical
plan for growing rich in premier mutual funds.</font><font
size="3"> By reading the <em><strong>Hot Funds Analyst</strong></em>,
you'll dramatically boost your profits with an exclusive listing
of the most highly prized mutual funds and invest with greater
confidence &amp; success.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This kind of wealth building strategy can make
you far more money than the average investor. And even a good
deal more than the so called Wall Street &quot;experts&quot;. It
is a mutual fund strategy that is designed to bring you truly </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="3"><i>tremendous</i></font><font size="3"> profits,
while uninformed investors meekly accept marginal returns or are
even losing money.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To prosper in a volatile market you need a
sure-fire system, not a guessing &quot;guru&quot;. In such a roller-coaster
environment you can't afford to rely on the gut feel guess of a
well intentioned guru. You need a non-emotional, unbiased, proven system
to keep you on the right side of the market.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3">The <em><strong>Hot Funds
Analyst</strong></em>'s time-tested mutual fund strategy is a

mutual fund strategy virtually eliminates the guesswork on when
to buy and when to sell, or even on what to buy and what to sell.
Simply put, it gives you an </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><i>exclusive
timing strategy</i></font><font size="3"> which gets you into the right
funds to profit from a major upmove and out before a major
