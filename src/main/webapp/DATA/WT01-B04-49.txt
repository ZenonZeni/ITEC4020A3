<H3><A NAME="Bkgrnd">Background</a></h3><p>
Exploration of Mars is a major thrust of NASA.  Some of the important goals of this exploration are (1) the search for life and understanding of the evolution of the planet, (2) the discovery of accessible water, (3) understanding how the climate has changed, and (4) developing an inventory of useful resources precursor to further human exploration.<p>

While many useful scientific investigations can be done in situ on the surface of Mars, there seems to be agreement that the main scientific objectives of exploration can only be achieved with the return of samples to Earth for analysis. For example, Ref. 1 says:  It has been the stated position of the Mars science community for some time that a Mars sample return mission is the highest priority science objective for Mars.  Ref. 2 says in reference to in situ analysis:  However, it must be recognized that these are lower priority goals, and that they cannot be allowed to compromise the primary objective of returning scientifically interesting samples from the surface of Mars. Ref. 1 also says:  The first priority goal of intensively understanding the details of the diversity of local materials at the surface of Mars can best (and perhaps only) be addressed by a mission that carefully samples Martian materials and returns them intact to Earth for intensive, detailed analysis.<p>

However, a sample return mission from Mars is a very significant undertaking. Vigorous attempts are now being made to develop new programmatic approaches to lower the cost of such a mission, with an eye toward a potential return in 2005.  NASA plans a series of nearer-term exploration missions involving landers which will provide important in situ data on Martian materials, but not as much as a sample return. These planned nearer-term affordable missions will be vital in solidifying capabilities for a series of evolving Mars missions with ever increasing capabilities.<p> 

In formulating a program emphasis for the Mars Exploration Technology Program, we were guided by several important factors:<p>
<OL>
<LI>A MSR mission appears to be of highest importance in the scientific exploration of Mars.
<LI>Past MSR mission plans do not appear to be affordable, and although new concepts are now being explored to reduce cost, the need for new technology to reduce cost appears necessary for there to be a MSR mission.
<LI>It is unlikely that there ever will be a MSR mission unless near and mid-term Mars surface exploration gets off to a strong and successful start to provide a foundation for an eventual MSR mission, and therefore the development of technology to strengthen these missions has very high priority.

<A NAME="Progemph"><H3>Program Emphasis</h3></a><p>
In view of the arguments presented in the previous section, it was decided that the thrust of this Technology Program will be divided between:<p>
<OL>
<LI>developing technology which will contribute to enabling a MSR mission, and 
<LI>developing critical technologies for near-term and mid-term Mars lander projects.  
</ol>
The choice of specific research topics for inclusion in this Technology Program is not a simple task. The NASA programmatic format for a future MSR mission will undoubtedly undergo a great deal of evolution over the next several years. At present, a system study led by Richard A. Wallace of JPL (Ref. 3) is exploring a number of possible alternate scenarios for a low cost MSR mission, and depending on the results of this study, the prioritization of various technologies for a MSR might be significantly altered. Although there is considerable previous literature on plans and needs for MSR missions, it is likely that funding limitations will dictate use of very different approaches than had been contemplated in the era 1970-1994.<p>

It is also difficult to prioritize technology for near-term and mid-term lander missions because the nature of these missions depends significantly on responses obtained from future requests for proposals. Also, there is not much time to develop technology for the first of these missions. However, the JPL Mars Exploration Office provided important analysis and advice in this regard. A number of generic needs were identified. These include a miniaturized telecommunications system, autonomous sample acquisition, in situ instruments, and various aspects of lander survivability and versatility, such as low temperature flight electronics, low temperature batteries and improved thermal control. <p>

<A NAME="Progcont"><H3>Program Content</h3></a>
The Mars Exploration Program is planning a series of missions involving landers launched in 1998, 2001, and 2003, and a sample return mission (if feasible) in 2005. The technology addressed in this Mars Exploration Technology Program is divided in its intent to provide technology products in time for these various missions. The longest term task is In Situ Propellant Production (ISPP) which is aimed at the sample return mission in 2005, although a prototype demonstration system could conceivably fly as a technology demonstration on an earlier mission. All the other tasks in the Mars Exploration Technology Program are aimed at either the 1998 lander or the 2001 lander, although in some tasks, such as autonomous sampling and instrument deployment, it is intended to seek an evolutionary development plan.  In terms of missions and timing, the various tasks are aimed at readiness on the time scales shown in Table 1.<p>

<A NAME="Strat"><H3>Strategy</h3></a><p>
The strategy of the Mars Exploration Technology (MET) Program is to place high priority on development of the core technologies for a sample return mission, while at the same time developing the most vital expected needs for near-term and mid-term lander missions.  The program plan will follow a path toward demonstrating significant new technological capabilities at NASA Readiness Level ~5 to 6 in several years. At each yearly step along the way, it is planned to consistently integrate these technologies into laboratory prototypes to assure that they function together as systems.  At intervals, these prototypes will be demonstrated in a more developed form to foster transfer to projects.  Wherever possible, the near-term demonstrations will be configured in such a way as to serve needs for near-term lander missions. Thus, we will steer a course, always following a beacon representing the shortest path toward the longer term goals, but branching activities off from this path to provide shorter term needs wherever they are compatible. <p>
