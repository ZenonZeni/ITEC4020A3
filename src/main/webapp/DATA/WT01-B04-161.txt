Regular drug use can cause a condition known as the delayed emotional development
syndrome. At whatever age the condition begins, the emotional development
of the user arrests. Hence, we find 40 year old people (some with excellent
jobs, others unemployed) demonstrating irresponsible adolescent behaviors.
Unfortunately, the enormous increase in drug use in the sixties and seventies
has led to a large adult cohort of drug users. <BR>
<BR>
Some adults have devoted their lives to advocating their drugs of choice,
demanding that we legitimize their choices and behavior. They deny the effects
of drug use on their health, families, and society. They run pro-drug advocacy
groups, magazines, web sites, etc. They deny the science that reflects the
harm that their drugs of choice cause, claiming that the government and
scientists are lying to them. Pro- drug advocacy groups send out by mail
and via the internet materials disputing scientific claims of the harm that
marijuana does and making outlandish claims of its benefits. Sadly, denial
and lying are as much a part of drug use as getting high. <BR>
<BR>
Psychoactive drugs reduce inhibitions and self control, impair judgment
and decision-making skills. Those under the influence make high risk decisions,
e.g., driving while impaired, having unsafe sex with inappropriate partners,
overreacting to stressful situations, and generally engaging in behaviors
that are highly likely to have negative consequences. Society is now reaping
the bitter fruits of increasing adolescent violence and anti-social behavior
as the pre and post-natally damaged children of the drug users of the seventies
and eighties come of age. <BR>
