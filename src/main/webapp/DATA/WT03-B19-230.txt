<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
The information technology market in Australia will be worth $14.5 billion in 19
95, and is projected to grow to $19.9 billion by 1999. Hardware is the largest 
single market sector ($4.5 billion), followed by services ($3.0 billion), data communications equipment ($2.7 billion) and software packages ($1.7 billion). Taken together software and services are much bigger than hardware alone and the expected strong growth in software and services could benefit Australian companies.
<P>
The communications industry will generate revenues of $26.7 billion in 1995, of
which $20.2 billion will be carrier revenues. The Australian equipment industry
will generate revenues of $5.2 billion, with much of this sourced locally. The communications industry will achieve exports in excess of $1 billion in 1995, with prospects of this growing to $3 billion by the year 2000.
<P>
Australia is increasingly recognised as a cost-competitive location from which to undertake manufacturing, research and development and service activities associated with the information technology and communications industry.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
The information technology and communications sector is likely to be the fastest
 growing sector in Victoria and Australia for the remainder of the 1990s.
<P>
Eight of the 12 main computer and communications hardware manufacturers in Australia have production facilities in Victoria. The IBM plant at Wangaratta is the
largest in Australia.
<P>
The technologies underpinning the information technology and communications industries are converging and software is increasingly important to both. Victoria has a strong base of specialist software developers and education and training facilities. 
Victoria's tertiary institutions supply over one-third of Australia's annual graduates in computing and electrical/electronics engineering.
<P>
Victoria has an extensive research and development infrastructure, which underpins much of Australia's reputation in this sector. Victorian Government established and funded bodies such as the Collaborative Information Technology Research Institute (CITRI), the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) and the
 Australian Computing and Communications Institute (ACCI), all located in Melbourne, have strong capabilities in advanced computing and communication technologies. Victoria is responsible for some 70% of Australia's expenditure on communications research and development, with Telstra Corporation, Australia's largest communications operator, locating its 550 person research laboratories in Melbourne,
where over $60 million is spent annually.
<P>
Major computing and communications equipment suppliers including, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Ericsson, Nokia Telecommunications, Philips, Fujitsu, NEC and Siemens all have manufacturing and/or R&D establishments in Melbourne, where most of Australia's optical fibre is also produced. Recent investments by Oracle Systems Australia, IBM and Olivetti will total $267 million over five years.
<P>
Victorian industry will be a significant beneficiary of the plans underway to build a state of the art broadband network to deliver a range of advanced entertainment and interactive services. Telstra Corporation is spending $3.3 billion on
network modernisation throughout Australia. Telstra has also announced plans to
spend $4.1 billion to build a hybrid fibre and coaxial cable network.Telstra has
 entered into a joint venture with News Corporation, FOXTEL, to deliver entertainment and interactive services. FOXTEL has opened its national customer sales and service centre in Melbourne, and will eventually employ 1000 people. Optus Vision, a consortium of Optus Communications, Continental Cablevision Inc. and Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, has also announced plans to invest $3 billion on its cable roll-out for the delivery of its services.
<P>
Victorian industry will supply all of the coaxial cable that will be used in both the Telstra and Optus Vision roll-outs and the bulk of the fibre optic cable that Telstra and Optus will require for their network upgrading and expansion.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</I></B>
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics forecasts sales of computing and communications
 equipment to average growth of almost 10% through to 2005. Similar growth is forecast in both export and domestic sales.
<P>
Spending on services and software is expected to continue to outpace spending on hardware in both the global and Australian markets and this trend has the potential to advantage Australian companies.
<P>
In the emerging multimedia industry, Australia and Victoria are well placed to provide content for the local and world markets for the new entertainment and interactive services offered by cable TV.
