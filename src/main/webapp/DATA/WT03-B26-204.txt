<p>In 1995, my <font color="#008000"><b>Growth Stocks Report</b></font>
model portfolios were up a whopping <font color="#008000"><b>143.73%.</b></font>
So far in 8 months of 1996, even after the sharp mid-year
correction, they are up another <font color="#008000"><b>21.17%.<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>If you'd invested $10,000 in Accustaff (ASTF) in November 95,
as I advised, you'd have turned your initial investment into
$42,510. <br>
</p>

<p>Your $10,000 investment in US Robotics (USRX), which I picked
in January last year, would have turned into $60,594 by July 96. <br>
</p>

<p>And in just 17 months, a $10,000 investment in Ascend
Communications (ASND) would have put $91,762 in your pocket.<br>
</p>

<p>How have I been able to do this, particularly when most
advisors and mutual funds are having such a tough time just keeping
up with the broad market averages like the S&amp;P 500 and the
Nasdaq. <br>
</p>

<p>And how can I make my systems yield <u>speedy, significant
growth</u> of your capital? Let me tell you... </p>

<p>In a moment, I am going to reveal a remarkable, time-tested,
system I've developed that will : </p>

<ul>
    <li>Keep you invested at all times in the best performing
        Growth Stocks. </li>
    <li>Give you the discipline to stay invested for double,
        triple digit profits. </li>
    <li>Let your profits keep running, while immediately cutting
        your losses. </li>
    <li>Signal when to sell your weaker stocks and replace them
        with the strongest. </li>
    <li>Make your stock investing easier and more successful than
        you ever imagined possible. <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p>How successful? Here are some of my most recent winning

INVESTMENT ADVISORS</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b><u>DON'T</u></b><b>
MAKE YOUR MONEY GROW FAST ENOUGH<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>My name is <i>Jay Saxena,</i> and I, like you, enjoy making
money. I mean big money. Not 10 or 20 %. But 50% or more - and I
can help you achieve this goal, too.<br>
</p>

<p>Ever since I first became fascinated with the stock market,
I've made it a habit to study every conceivable method for picking
winning stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Like most new investors, when I first got interested in trying
to increase my wealth, I looked at the results professional advisors
and newsletters were getting with their stock and mutual funds portfolios.<br>
</p>

<p>You've probably done much the same thing I did. I checked out
virtually all the stock investment newsletters. Zweig and The
Moneyletter. Value Line, The Chartist, Standard &amp; Poors.
Dozens and dozens of them.<br>
</p>

<p>I wasn't impressed. The vast majority of them either lost
money or posted gains that didn't even keep up with inflation. That's
not the way to make money grow. If you want to achieve the good
life and the financial security that lets you do what you want to
do, you've got to find a better way.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>THERE HAD TO BE A
BETTER METHOD</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>THAN WHAT THEY WERE
USING... <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>So, being an engineer by training (I have a Master's Degree in
Computer Science), and having an analytical mind, I thought I
could do better on my own. And I was sure I could improve upon
what were then state-of-the-art computer trading systems.<br>
</p>

<p>So I started developing a stock selection methodology that
would find the stocks with the highest probability of explosive
gains in the shortest time. </p>

<p>And I very quickly realized that the blue-chip stocks like
Xerox, GM, GE, IBM and AT&amp;T were not going to put me -- or
you, or anyone else -- on the fast track to wealth.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">The really big gains that can <u>turn
your small investment capital into a large fortune</u> come from
the small cap growth stocks.<br>
</font></p>

<p>So that's where I concentrated my efforts. And they've paid
off handsomely. In fact, in 1995-96 the average gain of the 6
stock model portfolios featured in our Growth Stocks Report is an
astounding 262.82%.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>WHY SHOULD YOU INVEST
IN</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>SMALL COMPANY GROWTH
STOCKS <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Quite simply, you should invest in small company growth stocks
because they are hands down <font color="#008000"><i>the most
successful investment category in the 20th century.</i></font>
They offer an excellent way to grow a portfolio faster than more
traditional methods.<br>
</p>

<p>In 1940 , $1000 invested in the stocks of the large-cap stocks
of the S&amp;P500 would have turned into about $330,300 by 1991,
with all interest and dividends reinvested. But the same $1,000
put into small company stocks would have netted a total of <font
color="#008000"><i>$1,965,000.</i></font> That is almost <font
color="#008000"><i>6 times</i></font> better than the S&amp;P500.<br>
</p>

<p>These figures are based on investing in <i>all</i> publicly
traded small firms listed on the exchanges or the over-the-counter market.
If you had carefully researched the <i>most</i> promising small
companies and placed your capital only with them, you would
almost certainly have done even better -- a great deal better.<br>
</p>

<p>In my newsletter, the Growth Stocks Report<font
color="#008000">,</font> I will share my expertise with you on
the growth stocks market and show you how to best profit from it.
With this newsletter, you can set yourself apart from the
majority of other investors, and your willingness to walk a
different path can result in much greater gains.<br>
</p>

<p>You're probably also going to have a more interesting,
exciting, and involving time than you would with a portfolio composed
only of blue chips, bonds, and mutual funds.<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>4 POWERFUL REASONS :
THE FACTS VS. MYTHS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Here are 4 powerful reasons why small cap stocks are such big
winners... </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>1. SIZE!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>&quot;Small cap&quot; companies are those with low (usually
under $500 million) capitalization. They have only a limited
amount of common and preferred stock outstanding.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>And right there is the major reason why they have so much
potential to make explosive gains -- they're small.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">Let's face it: a company with $200
million in sales has a much better chance of doubling to $400 million
than a $2 billion company has of doubling to $4 billion in sales. <br>
</font></p>

<p>And a small cap stock priced at $10 a share can much more
easily go to $20 than a blue chip stock at $100 a share can go to
$200. <br>
</p>

<p>Hey -- just look at the recent performance of some of the
small cap stocks I've picked in my newsletter, the Growth Stocks
Report, and you can easily see this principle in action : </p>

</p>

<p>What are the chances of GE or AT&amp;T or other blue chips <font
color="#008000"><u>ever</u></font> showing gains like that?<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>2. SPEED!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Small Cap Companies Can Move Fast!<br>
</u></b></p>

<p>Small cap companies are flexible, nimble. They represent the
best of the American entrepreneurial spirit. They find and quickly
exploit niches in the marketplace.<br>
</p>

<p>And they can shift directions fast to take advantage of new
opportunities, unlike some lumbering giant of a corporation filled
with bureaucrats and super-conservative accountants.<br>
</p>

<p>The best small companies have aggressive management and
motivated employee teams. They are hungry and quick to capitalize
on technological change. Quick to adapt to changing markets.
Quick to seize the day!<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">That means that if you're in the right
place -- where my stock selection system in the Growth Stocks Report
will put you - you can capture gains of 20%... 30%... 50%... even
100%-plus! in a very short time.<br>
</font></p>

<p>If we have periods of higher inflation, the share prices of
small stocks will rise much faster than blue chips. That means a $10
stock can quickly jump to $20, or even $50 in a matter of months.
That's the beauty of the small stocks. The best ones can hand you
a small fortune practically overnight.<br>
</p>

<p><b>But that's </b><b><u>not</u></b><b> all :</b> </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>3. EARNINGS!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>These Stocks Are Earnings-Driven!<br>
</u></b></p>

<p>When you look at historical growth rates, you quickly see that
small cap companies' earnings rise much faster than larger
companies'. <br>
</p>

<p>Earnings of small cap companies with less than $500 million in
sales, in fact, typically grow 10 to 12 times faster than blue
chip stocks. Think about it -- there's not much room for the
likes of GM and IBM to grow, and they certainly can't grow
rapidly. On the other hand, there is plenty of room for small
companies to grow -- and they will grow rapidly!<br>
</p>

<p>According to <font color="#008000"><i>Ibbotson &amp;
Associates</i></font><i>,</i> a market research firm, the
smallest 10 percent of the NYSE stocks outperformed the largest
10 percent by more than 30 times over the past 67 years. And this translates
into explosive stock price increases. In fact, in 1993 the NASDAQ
composite of small cap growth stocks had better than 2 times the growth
rate of the DOW and S&amp;P 500 for that year!<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Plus, They've Got 1 More Advantage :<br>
<br>
</u></b></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>4. GREAT LEVERAGE!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>When a small cap company's earnings grow, the earnings-
per-share aren't diluted... and that makes the stock more attractive
and more valuable.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">Then the basic laws of supply and demand
take over: with a limited number of shares available, a relatively
small amount of stock purchased can quickly push up the price of
the rest.<br>
</font></p>

<p>Small-cap stocks provide you with true ground floor
opportunities. By now, I'm sure you understand why I look to the small
cap stocks to build my wealth -- and why they can build your wealth,
too! <br>

ALPHA - RSM SYSTEM <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that my method uses a proprietary system
I've developed for identifying high-potential small cap stocks
that will yield explosive gains in a short time. Let me tell you
more about this...<br>
</p>

<p>I've already explained why I look to the small cap stocks for
my winners. Every week, my staff and I screen thousands of them,
looking for the handful that have the potential for spectacular
stock price increases. I want to invest only in the top 1% of all
growth stocks. To me, the other 99% are simply not acceptable. I
know from experience that only the top 1% will beat the market by
100% or more. That's where I want to put my money, and I imagine
you'd want to do the same.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>What are we looking for?</u></font>
Emerging companies poised for enormous growth. Or established
ones that are about to make major advances. We want companies
whose products are in such demand that they can't make them fast
enough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking
advantage of technological breakthroughs to create new,
super-fast growing businesses.<br>
</p>

<p>And we want to find them <font color="#008000"><u>before</u></font>
they're discovered by the financial media and hordes of
investors. So we can buy them ahead of the pack and take full
advantage of the run-up in their stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>I employ a combination of fundamental and technical approaches
to investing and have a rigid risk management system to keep my
reward to risk ratio high. I determine my trading ideas based on fundamental
analysis and time my purchases using technical analysis to
recommend the most promising small-cap growth stocks that show
strong technical patterns and evidence of accumulation. <br>
</p>

<p>Some of the fundamental and technical characteristics I look
for are accelerating earnings, positive earnings surprises, accelerating
revenues, high relative strength, high relative industry
strength, a low PE relative to the projected earnings growth
rate, innovative products in a market that is rapidly expanding,
rising order backlogs, and expanding profit margins. I sell when
a stock breaks down technically or violates my screening rules.<br>
</p>

<p>Part of this stock selection process uses the <font
color="#008000">C-A-N-S-L-I-M</font> methodology developed by
William O'Neil, which has proven highly successful. We set very
strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle the possibilities down
to a handful of companies with superior balance sheets and
liquidity, and little or no debt.<br>
</p>

<p>Then we take this short list and subject it to a rigorous
proprietary system based on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis.
This incorporates <u>both fundamental and technical factors</u>
like :<br>
</p>

<p><b>Valuation Indicators</b> -- P/E Ratio, Relative P/E Ratio,
Projected P/E Ratio, Price/Book Value Ratio, Price/Cash Flow
Ratio, Price/Capital Spending Ratio, Price/Sales Ratio </p>

<p><b>Earnings Indicators</b> -- Earnings Per Share, Earnings
Growth Rate, Projected Earnings, Earnings Velocity, EPS Increase,
EPS Consistency, Return on Assets, Return on Equity </p>

<p><b>Debt Risk Indicators</b> -- Current Ratio, Debt/Equity
Ratio, Interest Coverage, Debt Service/EPS </p>

<p><b>Balance Sheet Indicators</b> -- Book Value Growth Rate,
Capital Spending Growth Rate, Cash/Price Ratio, Inventory Turnover,
Receivables Turnover, Asset Turnover </p>

<p><b>Volume Indicators</b> -- Volume/Share, 30-Day Average
Volume, Vol/30-Day Average Volume Ratio, 5-Day/30-Day Average
Volume Ratio, Short Interest </p>

<p><b>Performance Indicators</b> -- Relative Strength, Price
Growth Rates, Least Squares Deviation, EPS Rank, Price Rank, Group
Rank, Accumulation Distribution </p>

<p><b>Background Indicators</b> -- Number and Percentage of
Institutional Holdings, Number of Outstanding Shares, Market Capitalization,
Insider Trading and Exercise of Options </p>

<p><b>Technical Indicators</b> -- Moving Averages, MACD,
Momentum, Stochastics, Wilder's RSI, Daily Range, High/Low, Beta,
Volatility, McClellan Oscillator and many more </p>

<p><b>Forecasting Indicators</b> -- Next 5 Weeks, Next 4 Months,
Next 1 Year and Next 3 Year % Probability of Increase and % Gain <br>
</p>

<p>I realize that's a staggering number of factors to take into
account. It's only possible because of the advanced computer system
I've developed. <font color="#008000">The bottom line is that the <i>Alpha-RSM
System</i> works. <u>It works like crazy!</u></font> Here are a
few more examples of the gains this system has won :<br>

<p>Now, my approach may be simple, but making sure my recommended
stocks are truly the top 1% takes a great deal of work. But don't
let that scare you. If you take advantage of my service, my staff and
I will do all the hard work for you.<br>
</p>

<p>Your job will be to simply duplicate my model portfolio, or
make up your own custom portfolio from my TOP 100 list. I'll
provide guidelines on how to construct a balanced portfolio for
your objectives. But whichever stocks you choose, you can be sure
they're among the top 1% of all growth stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Once you make the investments, you'll just sit tight until
it's time to take your profits. Each month I'll give you buy or
sell advice on every recommendation in our model portfolios. We
hold a stock anywhere from a few months to a couple of years.
Today's market is one of rapidly changing conditions, of
opportunities coming and going, of fortunes rising and falling in
a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace.<br>
</p>

<p>Today, a growth stock may do very well for a one, two, or
sometimes three years, but after a while its performance falls
off. That's when we take our profits and move on. The idea is to
own the best growth companies during their greatest growth
periods. </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>EIGHT UNIQUE BENEFITS
THAT CAN LEAD</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>YOU TO SPECTACULAR,
LONG-TERM PROFITS</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><u>WHY SHOULD YOU CONSIDER USING MY ALPHA-RSM
SYSTEM? <br>
</u></p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll only invest in the
        strongest stocks</b>,</font> even in weak markets. My
        system screens thousands of stocks, rejecting most of
        them, even so-called popular stocks. I am really only interested
        in stocks that can bring 100%, 200%, 500%, even 1000%
        gains over the long term. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll be in an enviable
        position</b>,</font> letting your profits run on stocks
        with virtually unlimited growth potential<i>.</i> At the
        same time you will be able to ruthlessly eliminate the
        weaker stocks, immediately cutting your losses. By doing
        just these two things, you would rise far above the average
        investor, who typically does just the opposite. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll know exactly what to do</b></font>
        -- buy, hold or sell, and when to do it. No need to even worry
        about the stock market on a day-to-day basis. You can
        relax peacefully, comfortable with the fact that since
        your money is invested in the best possible stocks,
        you'll make money over the long term, regardless of what
        the market does. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll discover relatively
        unknown companies</b><i>,</i></font> with spectacular
        growth patterns. These are the kind of stocks that most
        people hear about only <i>after</i> they have gone up
        2000%. But you'll be able to get in early and reap
        substantial profits. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll have the revolutionary
        Alpha-RSM System on your side</b></font> -- by following recommendations generated
        by our breakthrough stock selection techniques, you'll be racking up
        profits in virtually any kind of market. Our system is
        able to find good stocks even in tough markets. For
        example, our portfolio was up almost 110% in 1994, when
        the S&amp;P500 gained barely 1.3% and the Nasdaq actually
        lost money. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll know exactly when to sell
        your stocks</b></font> -- This is one of the most
        critical things that some newsletters neglect. They tell
        you when to buy, but forget to tell you when to sell.
        While I firmly believe in a patient, disciplined approach
        to stock investing, I also believe in selling when it's
        time to sell. There's no place for emotion here. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll NOT be required to trade
        extensively</b></font> -- I believe that long-term
        investors make money for themselves while short-term
        traders just make money for their brokers. In fact, the Alpha-RSM
        System is so easy to use that you probably won't have to
        devote more than 15 minutes a month to your investments. </li>
    <li><font color="#008000"><b>You'll have a choice of 6 model
        portfolios to help you properly diversify</b></font> your investment dollars.
        All you have to do is select the portfolio that's right
        for you and then each month just follow your lead, adding
        a few new stocks and selling those that have reached their
        peak. <br>
        </li>
</ul>

ADVISORY LETTER</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>EVEN COMES CLOSE TO MY
GAINS!</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><u>143.73% IN 1995, 21.17% YTD

</u></font></p>

<p>There is a real difference between the <font color="#008000"><b>Growth
Stocks Report</b></font> and all the other stock investment advisories.
I don't waste your time.<br>
</p>

<p>My letter is just six pages long -- you can read it and get
the information you need in a matter of minutes. I don't believe you
want a lot of wordy explanations for my recommendations, or &quot;philosophy&quot;
about the markets and the general economic climate, or carefully
hedged predictions.<br>
</p>

<p>You know the type: &quot;such and such a stock may climb if
this happens, but could also decline under this other scenario, etc.,
etc.&quot; You won't find that in the Growth Stocks Report.<br>
</p>

<p>Instead, you'll find a no-nonsense listing of recommended
investments. <font color="#008000">Specific BUY or SELL recommendations.</font>
A running tally of current returns for each and every stock in
the portfolio. And cumulative model portfolio returns.<br>
</p>

<p>While every complete investment strategy contains a number of
conservative vehicles, one that hopes to build wealth quickly
must take advantage of the opportunities in small cap stocks. And that's
where The Growth Stocks Report excels. <font color="#008000">It
is a well researched and easy-to-follow newsletter devoted <i><u>exclusively
to the best growth stocks</u></i> in America today.<br>
</font></p>

<p>Each month, we'll give you a list of &quot;100 Most Attractive
Growth Stocks.&quot; Out of those 100, we'll tell you which ones to
buy in the model portfolios. We will add up to 5 stocks that have
the greatest potential to explode with 20%...50%... 100%... and
even higher gains.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>STOCKS THAT DOUBLE
REALLY TURN ME ON!<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Even I am amazed by my newsletters outstanding record. Just
look at the performance of our past recommendations. Gains of
100% or more are NOT rare! Time and time again, I've selected
stocks for the model portfolios that have <u>doubled</u> in just
a few short months:<br>

<p>Regardless of your investment objectives, you've got to
include some of these stars in your portfolio. No other investments
will do nearly as well in the next few years. These super stocks
have all passed my rigorous analysis. They all have explosive
growth potential!<br>
</p>

<p>If you are retired, I suggest you allocate a portion of your
nest egg -- 20% or 25% -- to as many of these future blockbusters
as you can buy, since no other stocks will grow so quickly. That
could mean a much bigger nest egg for you in just a couple of
years.<br>
</p>

<p>If you are 5 years from retirement, using these stocks is the
best way to triple, and even quadruple, your nest egg in just this
short time. Imagine what a difference that can make for you. Of
course if you're 10, 15, 20, or even 25 years away from
retirement, you can't afford not to take advantage of these very
profitable small-cap growth stocks.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>You'll get the Growth Stocks Report
by FAX or E-mail on the first business day of every month.</u></font>
If you don't have a fax machine or Internet e-mail, you'll
receive your Growth Stocks Report by first class mail, usually by
the 7th of every month.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">You will also have 24-hour access to our
two telephone hotlines -- one is updated monthly for new buys and
sells while the other is updated weekly to bring you the latest
news about the stocks in our model portfolios.</font> These
numbers are changes periodically to prevent any unauthorized use.<br>
</p>

<p>Whether you take delivery by fax, e-mail or first class mail,
you'll discover the Growth Stocks Report gives you greater control
over your profits.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>SMALL RISE IN SHARE
PRICE</b></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>EQUALS HUGE GAIN<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>This is your chance to dramatically increase your wealth in a
very short period of time. Again, that's the beauty of small stocks
-- the share price can climb dramatically, so fast. Remember, a
$5 jump on a $10 stock can give you a much higher percentage gain
than a $5 increase on a $100 stock.<br>
</p>

<p>Let's see how this works. If you buy a stock selling at $10,
and it climbs $5, to $15 a share, you have a 50% gain. But the
same $5 upmove in a stock selling at $100 is just a 5% gain. And
of course for the same investment, you can buy a lot more shares
of the $10 stock than you can of a $100 stock.<br>
</p>

<p>If you invest $5,000 in a stock selling at $10, you can buy
500 shares. Then if the share price climbs $5, your profit is $2500
(5 x 500 = 2500). That's a 50% gain on your original investment. <br>
</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you invest $5,000 in a stock selling at
$100, you can buy just 50 shares. Here, a $5 gain gives a profit
of just $250 (5 x 50 = 250).<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000"><b>SAFETY FIRST -- GO
WITH QUALITY <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>You don't have to be a mathematical genius to see the enormous
advantage in small stocks. That's why I am so excited. For the
next several years, these explosive investments will post the
biggest gains!<br>
</p>

<p>But again, you have to know which ones to buy. Not every small
stock is going to do well. In fact, most of them aren't worth
your trouble. I can't stress this point too much. To achieve both
high gains and safety, you must invest only in the highest-quality
small stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>The problem is, you can't get timely and reliable information
on quality small-cap growth stocks. And yet, without such information,
you will not know which growth stocks to buy, nor when to sell them
for the highest profit. <font color="#008000"><b>You need The Growth
