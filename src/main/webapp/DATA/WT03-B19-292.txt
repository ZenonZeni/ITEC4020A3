<BODY>
<FONT SIZE="+2">
Because of its comparatively high rainfall and rich soils,
West Gippsland produces quality primary products such as beef
cattle, potatoes, vegetables, flowers and timber.  West Gippsland
claims with justification to be the &quot;fine food capital of Victoria&quot;,
as its lush pastures produce much of the state's milk and support
numerous processors and retailers of value added commodities.
<P>
West Gippsland is close to Melbourne, and it offers an attractive
regional lifestyle.  It has excellent transport connections to
the heavy industrial and power generation centres of the Latrobe
Valley, and local municipalities are committed to attracting new
industries to the region.

<P>

The major population centres of the region (Warragul and Drouin)
are located along the Princes Freeway (a double highway to Melbourne),
and the Gippsland Railway.
<P>
Rail passengers are served by regular services to Melbourne
and Sale in the east, and a V/Line Regional Freight Centre at
Warragul handles door to door freight transport.
<P>
With its plentiful high quality agricultural land and ample
industrial land and buildings, West Gippsland is well placed to
service the astute investor who wishes to locate in a region that
offers all the services expected of large centres, but still maintains
traditional rural strengths.
<P>
<H2>Dairy is dominant</H2>
<P>
<img src="gifs2/wgcows.gif" align=right>
The dairy industry is dominated by Bonlac Foods, which processes
milk products at Longwarry, Drouin and Warragul.
The plants produce a collective annual total of 19,000 tonnes
of butter and 12,000 tonnes of milk powder.  The Drouin factory
has been extensively upgraded to allow increased production of
cheese.  Smaller dairy manufacturers, such as Tarago River Cheese
of Neerim South, are achievmg prominence for producing specialty
cheeses for export.  Plastics, clothing and textiles, commercial
printing and services to agriculture are important sectors of
local industry.  Reticulated natural gas is available in the towns
of Drouin and Warragul.
<P>
Major employers already established include Bonlac Foods,
AC1 Morapak, a division of BTR Nylex (plastic packaging), Momentum
Printing and Publishing and TCC Corporation (clothing).
<P>
West Gippsland has expertise in farm equipment engineering.
A number of small, high technology producers based in the region
manufacture products such as tea harvesters, potato machinery
and other equipment, often for export.
<P>
<H2>Development Opportunities</H2>
<P>
The horticultural industry provides opportunities for expansion.
Vast potential exists to increase value adding to agricultural
commodities such as vegetables and the locally produced, high
quality milk.  The Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture
at Warragul, which provides tertiary level training for primary
industry students, supports agricultural industries.
<P>
The timber industry is also beginning to capitalise on the
potential of value-adding, and a number of sawmills in West Gippsland
have installed kilns to dry timber.  Drouin West Saw Mills, Erica
Saw Mills and Darnum and Stoll Brothers, Rokeby, now provide the
kind of high quality specialty timber products that are increasingly
being sought by export makets, particularly Japan.
<P>
West Gippsland's economy has a number of other distinctive
features.  The region produces educational supplies and services,
such as educational stationery at Drouin.  A number of large poultry
producers operate locally, a commercial trout fishing industry
is located in the region, and a number of farmers are increasing
their exports by growing flowers.
<P>
Considerable interest is being demonstrated in eco-tourism,
and given the excellent transport services and the region's comparative
proximity to Melbourne, the potential is enormous.
<P>
<H2>Gourmet Deli Region</H2>
<P>
Because of its scenic natural appeal, the region enjoys a
steadily increasing volume of visitors.  The area has developed
a number of specialty food manufacturers who market their products
through the highly successful Gourmet Deli Region, which encourages
tourists to sample local produce.
<P>
West Gippsland provides a high standard of community services,
such as education, retailing, medical care and recreation.  The
500-seat West Gippsland Arts Centre, located at Warragul, provides
a major regional venue for theatre, cinema and live performances.

<P>
One of the main annual events is the Gippsland Field Days,
the State's premier agricultural demonstration of primary industry
produce, equipment and livestock, which attracts thousands of
visitors.
