HEAT ON US ANALGESICS AS BAYER LAUNCHES ACTRON

Bayer has launched Actron, its OTC version of the non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory, ketoprofen, onto an already crowded US market for
headache.

Actron is entering the non-prescription market two months after
Whitehall-Robins' rival ketoprofen brand, Orudis KT, and 18 months
after Procter-Syntex' NSAI switch, Aleve (naproxen sodium), shook up
the intensely competitive analgesic segment.

So far the principle that being first to market is crucial to the long-
term success of switches appears to be confirmed by Johnson &
Johnson/Merck's H2-antagonist, Pepcid AC (famotidine) - a product that
was something of an also-ran in prescription drug terms.

Pepcid has managed to maintain around a seven per cent market share
differential over SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet HB (cimetidine) by
arriving first, Merck & Co senior vice-president Judy Lewent told
securities analysts in mid-December.

"Thanks to Merck research, Pepcid was first on the market because,
quite frankly, Tagamet had better name recognition. If Pepcid had come
in second, that would have been a challenge", she said.

Small but powerful

Bayer announced on 8 January that Actron was available in drug, food
and mass merchandise retail outlets throughout the US. Both versions of
ketoprofen were approved for OTC switching by the Food and Drug
Administration on 6 October 1995 (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 32,
page 3).

Actron is being promoted in full-page newspaper advertisements in top
20 markets and USA Today, as well as in television adverts featuring
the theme, "Actron. It's so small because it's so powerful."

Bayer sees size as a key selling point - Actron is 7ml in diameter, at
least one-third smaller than (Whitehall's) Advil, (Johnson & Johnson's)
Extra Strength Tylenol and Orudis KT tablets.

The company is supplying a full array of promotional materials,
including "Try Me Free" displays in many retail outlets. This will
enable consumers to purchase one 24-tablet bottle with full-price
rebate during the introductory period.

Gary Balkema, president of Bayer Consumer Care in the US, said the
launch was the single biggest in the division's history.

"We're excited to be launching Actron because it represents a
meaningful new choice in OTC pain relief", he commented. "Actron's
powerful medicine offers effectiveness against many types of pain. And
its unique size gives a new, tangible benefit for consumers: it's easy
to swallow."

Bayer appears to be counting on its Aspirin legacy to give the new
brand vital leverage in the analgesics market.

"With Bayer Aspirin, this company brought the first branded analgesic
to the consumer marketplace almost 100 years ago. Now with Actron,
we're poised to significantly impact the analgesics category again as
we approach the 21st century", Mr Balkema said.

A recent survey conducted by Bayer found there was "more than enough
room in the very competitive OTC analgesics market for a differentiated
new entry like Actron", he added.

Unmet need

This study confirmed that 89 per cent of American adults suffer from
aches and pains each year but more than a third of these do not at
present take medication to help relieve the pain. The average adult
spends one of every five days - or a total of more than two months each
year - in pain, the survey found.

"Because analgesics can work differently in many individuals, we think
offering Actron as a new choice with ketoprofen in a unique new size
will go a long way towards serving unmet consumer need", Mr Balkema
asserted.

Merck & Co's comments on Pepcid AC were made to securities analysts on
12 December 1995. Ms Lewent said the brand was the leading US acid
relief product with a market share of 22 per cent at the end of
November, successfully thwarting the challenge from Tagamet HB.

SmithKline Beecham maintains, however, that its product is performing
extremely well in the US market. Analysts' estimates put Tagamet HB
sales at around $3 million per week, only slightly behind Pepcid AC.

Ms Lewent presented Nielsen data indicating that Pepcid AC climbed to
the number one spot in the $1 billion antacid market within one month
of its OTC launch in June 1994. When Tagamet HB was subsequently
introduced in mid-August, it leapt to number one, the Nielsen data
showed.

Pepcid AC regained the lead in late September and was holding onto it
as of 25 November, the Merck official said.

According to the Nielsen data, Tagamet HB then dipped to third place -
just behind SB's older antacid, Tums - with about a 13 per cent market
share. J&J/Merck's Mylanta held just over 10 per cent of the segment.

Most successful OTC?

Ms Lewent described Pepcid AC as "the most successful launch in US OTC
history. The big initial push ... for Tagamet HB was the direct result
of very heavy couponing", she noted.

"The significant market expansion that we are seeing validates the
theory that bringing an established prescription product with a
significant franchise into the OTC market can transform the marketplace
and revitalise growth", the Merck official told analysts.

Pepcid slightly widened its lead in the week ended 2 December 1995,
according to the company's figures. The brand's most recently quoted
market share was 24 per cent compared with 12 per cent for Tagamet HB.

Despite the strong initial sales, Merck & Co does not expect to see
substantial profits from Pepcid AC until the end of the decade because
of heavy promotional spending, Ms Lewent said.

SB BUYS INTO GERMAN MASS MARKET

SmithKline Beecham prepared for Christmas by fattening up its German
OTC business with a DM203 million ($142 million) agreement to purchase
Abtei Pharma-Vertriebs GmbH, a distributor of vitamin and mineral
supplements (VMS) and natural remedies.

The acquisition sees SB widen its consumer healthcare interests in
Germany - previously centred on oral care and the pharmacy sector - to
take in grocery outlets, where Abtei is the leading OTC presence,
SmithKline says.

Assuming approval by the Federal Cartel Office, the transaction will
also make SB the leading consumer healthcare company in Germany, it
adds.

Based in Bielefeld, Westphalia, Abtei is a family-owned concern founded
in 1972 (although the Abtei brand dates back to the last century). It
has a workforce of 125. Last year Abtei registered sales of DM130
million compared with DM110 million in 1994.

The company's product range includes vitamin and mineral supplements,
natural medicines, dietary products and skincare. Around half of its
portfolio is licensed medicines and the rest food and vitamin
supplements.

Abtei holds a 20 per cent share of a German OTC grocery market valued
at DM550 million (manufacturers' selling prices).

Oral care profile

To date, SmithKline has been associated mainly with oral care in
Germany, and it is the market leader in this category, the company
noted. Its existing German subsidiaries are Lingner & Fischer, which
sells oral hygiene products, and Fink, ranked sixth in the pharmacy OTC
market.

This latest acquisition will boost SB's share of the German healthcare
market by 25 per cent.

Abtei will both complement and consolidate SmithKline's pharmacy VMS
business, which includes leading brands such as Eunova multivitamins,
Cetebe (vitamin C) and Granufink for urological indications, offering
potential to divert SB pharmacy brands through Abtei's grocery channels
and visa versa.

The move into the mass market does not signal a particular European
strategy but is rather country-specific, and reflects Germany's
propensity for preventative healthcare, SB told OTC Business News.

However, Peter Jensen, chairman of SmithKline Beecham Consumer
Healthcare Europe, said the OTC division would undertake "a full
analysis of the market opportunity for the (Abtei) products across
Europe and elsewhere".

"With the increasing consumer awareness of positive "well-being"
healthcare and with ageing populations in the developed world, we
consider that natural medicines and health supplements have tremendous
potential for expansion, and our track record has demonstrated SB's
ability to reach the target consumers', he commented.

SB estimates the European OTC grocery market at #1.5 billion "and
growing".

No short-term changes

SmithKline will retain the Abtei brand and says it does not plan any
short-term changes in the German company's operations. It has given
undertakings to consult Abtei's management on any future restructuring.

Manufacturing for Abtei is contracted out, and these arrangements will
remain in place after the acquisition.

The German company had been looking for a partner to help it expand
further on the domestic and international health shop and pharmacy
markets, said managing director Andreas Sarhage.

SB had the resources to support Abtei on the medical and scientific
front, and to bolster its international product development, he added.

The deal suggests that relatively modest, targeted acquisitions are the
way into the German OTC market, which is regarded as somewhat
impenetrable.

Boots Healthcare International has made no secret of its ambition to
buy up a German OTC presence but to date has cited price levels as a
persistent deterrent.

FEMSTAT SECOND SWITCH FOR PROCTER-SYNTEX

Procter-Syntex is preparing a spring launch for its second prescription-
to-OTC switch, Femstat 3 vaginal cream (butoconazole nitrate 2 per
cent).

Cleared for OTC use by the Food and Drug Administration on 27 December
1995, Femstat will be the first and only three-day treatment for
vaginal yeast infections available without a prescription in the US,
said Procter & Gamble, which will market the product to physicians and
other health professionals as well as direct to consumers.

All of the current OTC options for vaginal yeast infection require
seven days of treatment, P&G noted, adding that clinical trials had
shown Femstat 3 to be as safe and effective as Johnson & Johnson's
Monistat 7, the leading brand in an estimated $250 million US market
for OTC vaginal antifungals (IIR retail figures, November 1995).

Butoconazole nitrate was first launched on prescription in 1986 and has
been marketed as a three-day regimen by Syntex (now part of Roche) as
Femstat and Femstat Prefill. The US patent on butoconazole for fungal
infections expires in March 1997; Procter-Syntex will now gain three
years of marketing exclusivity for Femstat 3.

Prescription Femstat will be withdrawn from the US market once its OTC
derivative is launched, P&G said.

The non-prescription version was developed by The Procter-Syntex Health
Products Company, the US joint venture that brought its first switch,
Aleve (naproxen sodium), to market in June 1994. Femstat will be
manufactured for OTC sale by Roche.

An NDA for the prescription-to-OTC switch was filed with the FDA on 20
December 1993. Because the safety and efficacy data were comparable
with seven-day OTC yeast treatments, Femstat 3 did not have to undergo
advisory committee review, P&G told OTC Business News.

Creams preferred

Femstat 3 will be available in US pharmacies, drugstores, supermarkets
and mass merchandise outlets in a 5g prefilled disposable applicator,
with three applicators packaged together as a per-day treatment
regimen. The cream will also be sold in a 20g tube packaged with three
disposable cardboard applicators.

According to P&G, its research indicates that more than 50 per cent of
women would rather buy vaginal creams than suppositories. "This plays
out in the marketplace, where nearly 70 per cent of OTC vaginal yeast
infection products sold are in the form of creams", the company
commented.

It stressed that Femstat 3 is for treating the recurrent symptoms of
previously diagnosed vaginal yeast infection: first-time sufferers
should consult a doctor.

A physician should also be contacted if there is abdominal pain, fever
or a foul-smelling discharge; if the infection does not clear up in
three days or symptoms return within two months; or if the sufferer
thinks she has been exposed to the HIV virus.

Women who are (or believe they may be) pregnant should not use Femstat
3, the labelling points out. The product is also contraindicated in
women who are HIV-positive, diabetics and girls under 12 years old.

Clinical evidence

More than 13 million women worldwide have been treated with
butoconazole nitrate for vaginal yeast infections. In 45 clinical
studies involving a total of 5,289 patients, the drug-related incidence
of local adverse reactions (eg, burning and itching) with butoconazole
was equivalent to that of Monistat 7, P&G said.

Two controlled clinical trials conducted in support of the switch
application showed that a three-day regimen of butoconazole nitrate 2
per cent (more than 300 patients were evaluated) was as safe and
effective as seven days of miconazole nitrate 2 per cent cream
(Monistat 7, also tested on more than 300 patients) in combating
vulvovaginal candidiasis when assessed at eight and 30 days post-
treatment, the company added.

According to P&G, the incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the US
nearly doubled between 1980 and 1990, to 13 million cases per year.

Handsome payoff

Vaginal antifungal switches have paid off handsomely in the US. The
first such product to reach the market, Schering-Plough's Gyne-
Lotrimin, grew from a $27 million brand prescription to generate $115
million in OTC sales.

However, Gyme-lotrimin is now relegated firmly to second place in the
OTC vaginal antifungal segment, with a market share of 15.7 per cent
compared with Monistat's 49.9 per cent.

ASTRA WEIGHS UP BUDESONIDE OPTIONS

Astra Pharmaceuticals has yet to decide on an OTC marketing strategy
for budesonide, the corticosteroid that was cleared for UK sale as a
pharmacy-only medicine for hayfever by the Medicines Control Agency at
the end of last year.

Astra confirmed that a budesonide licence had been issued but would say
no more as yet about how it might proceed with a P version. The company
does not have an OTC division.

The approved indication is for the prevention and treatment of seasonal
allergic rhinitis in adults and children aged over 12 years (OTC
Business News Vol 2, Issue 29, page 7).

Astra sells budesonide on prescription in the UK for the treatment of
perennial, allergic and vasomotor rhinitis in nasal aerosol and nasal
spray formulations (as Rhinocort and Rhinocort Aqua respectively). The
UK P licence is for non-aerosol administration.

NEW DRUGSTORES FORMAT PAYING OFF AT LLOYDS?

Despite a 3.5 per cent decline in like-for-like sales by its troubled
drugstores division in the second quarter, those stores already
operating under the new health and beauty format "registered higher
numbers of customers and increased sales" against the same quarter of
1994, said Lloyds Chemists.

The UK company took a #13.4 million provision last year to reorganise
its Supersave chain, which recorded a #3.7 million loss before tax in
the year to June 1995 compared with a #1.2 million profit in 1993/94
(OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 33, page 8).

The re-think involved closing more than one third of the Supersave
outlets, converting some of them into the more fruitful Holland &
Barrett format (like-for-like sales up 10.3 per cent in the second
quarter), and incorporating some 175 stores into the chemists division
with a health and beauty profile.

Without adjustment for closures, drugstore sales were down by 29.1 per
cent in the first and 45.9 per cent in the second quarter of 1995/96.
In the half year to December, sales through the drugstores fell by 37.9
per cent to #29.6 million (the like-for-like decline was 6 per cent).

The overall picture was happier for Lloyds: total sales rose by 2.4 per
cent and 2.1 per cent in the quarter and half year respectively. Like-
for-like sales in the chemists division were 5.9 per cent ahead (+0.9
per cent in the first quarter), with growth in both prescription and
cash sales.

BELGIAN INDUSTRY FEARS BLOCK ON ADVERTS

OTC companies in Belgium fear the new system of approval for television
and radio advertisements may be so restrictive that many adverts will
never reach the screen.

The system, introduced last year to bring Belgium into line with the
European Union's advertising Directive (92/28/EEC), means OTC
manufacturers can now legally advertise their products nationwide,
formalising what had already been common practice at regional level.

But advertisements must be approved before they can be broadcast. A new
body, the Commission de Controle de la publicite des medicaments
(commission for the control of medicines advertising), is charged with
vetting adverts and then making recommendations to the Minister of
Public Health on whether they may be screened (OTC Business News Vol 1,
Issue 23, page 1).

During its first two months of operation, the commission is believed to
have given positive recommendations on several advertisements. However,
the Minister may still disregard the commission's advice and refuse to
grant screening authorisations.

Ministerial opposition

Fears that this might happen have been given credence by recent
ministerial statements voicing opposition to any advertising of OTC
products on television. One industry source commented that the
government may do everything in its power to make advertising as
difficult as possible.

But with the first advertising 'visas' likely to be granted within the
next few weeks, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry association, AGIM,
is adopting a "wait and see" approach.

The new procedures are likely to continue coming under attack from OTC
companies, which object in principle to the prior approval requirement
for advertisements.

And, as a Belgian source noted, the system is a headache for companies
that want to run pan-European advertising campaigns.

The costs of the vetting procedure, which are met by prospective
advertisers, have also come under fire - particularly the charge of
BFr25,000 ($846) for the renewal of a two-year advertising licence.

As the source commented: "It's just a question of putting the right
stamp on the right papers."

IBUPROFEN AND CLOTRIMAZOLE NOW OFFICIALLY GSL

Ibuprofen and topical clotrimazole are now formally cleared for general
over-the-counter sale in the UK.

Amendments to the General Sale Order releasing the ingredients from
pharmacy-only (P) control in specified strengths and quantities went
through on 29 December 1995, taking effect from 1 January 1996.

This was despite strong reservations voiced by UK pharmacists and their
representatives, who have raised concerns about unsupervised use of
ibuprofen and clotrimazole leading to drug interactions or serious side-
effects in special cases such as asthmatics.

The amendments were put out for consultation last summer after
pharmacists' hackles were raised by a temporary GSL approval
unexpectedly granted to Galpharm's 200mg ibuprofen tablets (OTC
Business News Vol 2, Issue 26, page 1).

Pharmacist resentment has already prompted two companies to backtrack
on plans to launch GSL versions of ibuprofen, although Crookes
Healthcare (Boots), the UK brand leader with Nurofen, has held firm to
its intention of entering the grocery market.

In September Zyma Healthcare (Ciba), which had already secured a
temporary exemption from pharmacy-only status, decided to restrict its
ibuprofen brand, Proflex, to pharmacy distribution. Subsequently
Dendron announced that it would maintain its topical ibuprofen,
Ibuleve, as a pharmacy-only product.

The UK Medicines Control Agency (MCA) recently held out an olive branch
to pharmacists by proposing to establish a standardised P-to-GSL
procedure, similar to that already operating for POM-to-P switches -
although this concept is opposed by the OTC industry on confidentiality
grounds (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 33, page 10).

GSL specifications

The GSL amendments specify that ibuprofen for oral administration must
be limited to adults and children aged over 12 years, and that: the
indications are for rheumatic and muscular pain, backache, neuralgia,
migraine, headache, dental pain, dysmenorrhea, feverishness and
symptoms of cold and influenza; the maximum dose is 400mg; and the
maximum daily dose is 1200mg.

The 12 years and over stipulation also applies to topical ibuprofen
when on general sale. Additional restrictions are that the indications
are for relief of rheumatic pain and muscular aches, and of pains and
swellings such as strains, sprains and sports injuries; the maximum
strength is 5 per cent; the maximum dose is 125mg; and the maximum
daily dose is 500mg.

GSL clotrimazole is limited to external use. The indication must be for
athlete's foot and the maximum strength 1 per cent.

The MCA has also specified maximum pack or container sizes for the new
GSL medicines: 12 X 200mg units for oral ibuprofen; not more than 2.5mg
per pack for topical ibuprofen; and not more than 500mg per pack for
topical clotrimazole.

Questioned wisdom

John Ferguson, secretary and registrar of the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain, questioned the wisdom of adding further
medicines to the General Sale List.

UK law recognised that the public should have ready access to informed
advice when considering whether to use a non-prescription drug, he
said, adding that this was particularly important for people suffering
from certain medical conditions and for pregnant women.

Citing concerns about ibuprofen's potential to provoke asthma attacks
even at low doses, he asked who would offer advice on side-effects or
drug interactions "at the supermarket checkout or garage forecourt".

Moreover, Mr Ferguson said, he could not see the justification for
wider availability of clotrimazole, as athlete's foot was unlikely to
require urgent attention. There was also a risk of people buying GSL
clotrimazole products to treat other fungal infections, "for which, in
law, they would still need to be obtained from a pharmacy so that
professional advice would be available".

"This is a serious issue with implications for the management and
enforcement of the licensing of medicines in this country. The Society
is looking for clarification on how the government intends to ensure
that conditions attached to the licences for these products are
enforced", Mr Ferguson stated.

The MCA insisted, however, that the patient information leaflets (PILs)
now mandatory with new or amended medicines licences would provide a
buffer against misuse. Licensed GSL medicines are obliged to carry
safety information either on packaging or a PIL.

The licensing authority has also cleared for general sale a higher dose
of folic acid (500mcg as opposed to the current ceiling of 400mcg); and
various minor ingredients such as benzoin tincture compound in pastille
form, equisetum, magnesium alginate, choline bitartrate, capsicum
oleoresin and capsicum (water soluble).

Nurofen imminent

The MCA has seen a growing number of applications for GSL ibuprofen.
Crookes Healthcare told OTC Business News that it obtained a temporary
approval for Nurofen (ie, by the same route as Galpharm) in the week of
12 December 1995.

GSL Nurofen will be on the shelves soon, the company said. The patient
leaflet will include full information on side-effects and
contra indications, in line with the provision for P Nurofen, it added.

Branded versions of 1 per cent clotrimazole on the UK OTC market are
Bayer Consumer Care's Canesten Cream and Crookes Healthcare's more
recent line extension, Mycil Gold Clotrimazole.

Both companies, however, said they had no current plans to move their
products into the GSL sector.

An application to market GSL clotrimazole was made by Scholl Consumer
Products, which already sells a range of treatments for athlete's foot
in the UK containing 1 per cent tolnaftate.

The company confirmed to OTC Business News that it had secured approval
for GSL clotrimazole, and said it was reviewing whether to take the
licence further. A decision is expected shortly.

WHICH? SLAMS PHARMACISTS AGAIN

Which? magazine has once again taken UK pharmacists to task over their
supervision of pharmacy (P) medicine sales.

In their latest snap survey, the Consumers Association (CA) researchers
found that nearly half the pharmacy staff approached "sold the wrong
drugs or failed to give the right advice", Which? said.

The CA has decided to oppose any further prescription-to-OTC switches
until it is confident that its concerns about P medicine supervision
have been fully addressed.

Although the issue has been bubbling under since Which? ran its last
critical report in June 1994 (OTC Business News Vol 1, Issue 1, page
14), this was the second time in less than a month that consumer
research had cast doubt on the protocols for P medicine sales
introduced at the beginning of 1995.

Shortly before Christmas, a radio broadcast by the BBC consumer
programme, You and Yours, drew similarly damning conclusions about
protocol adherence after running tests at 40 pharmacies around the UK.

But pharmacy representatives, while admitting that some of the findings
are cause for concern,
have attacked the surveys as failing to grasp
the realities of the pharmacist/consumer relationship.

Nurofen test

Five (anonymous) Which? researchers were sent to 10 pharmacies around
the UK with specific brand or treatment requests as well as a prepared
history of symptoms and concomitant drug use.

With Crookes Healthcare's Nurofen, the test was predicated on the
potential of ibuprofen to interact with methotraxate, a prescription
drug for psoriasis, or to aggravate the symptoms of asthma.

The researcher was told to say, if asked, that she did not suffer from
asthma but was taking other medication. If further questioned, she was
instructed to say she was on methotraxate.

Seven out of 10 pharmacies wrongly sold the researcher Nurofen, Which?
reported. In two of these no questions were asked, while in one a sales
assistant enquired whether the customer was on medication but did not
ask what it was, and subsequently sold her Nurofen.

In three of the outlets the pharmacist was involved in the interaction
and was aware that the researcher was taking methotraxate, but still
sold her Nurofen. The researcher was asked if she suffered from asthma
in six of the pharmacies.

The pharmacist was alerted to the request for a P medicine in only five
of the eight cases where the researcher was served by a sales
assistant, Which? added.

These findings are particularly worrying in view of the decision to
allow ibuprofen to go on general sale, the magazine commented (see
separate story on page 6).

It agrees with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain
(RPSGB) that ibuprofen should remain subject to pharmacist supervision.
"However, our research shows that, even in pharmacies, it's often being
sold without these safety checks", Which? said.

Crookes Healthcare, noted that the failings highlighted by Which?
largely concerned pharmacy assistants. The issue of P medicine
supervision was being looked at constantly, and the company would work
to ensure both that assistants understood their role and that this role
was made easy for them, it said.

Canesten let-down

Three versions of Bayer's Canesten are available across the pharmacy
counter in the UK: a 500mg clotrimazole pessary and a 10 per cent
cream, both for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis (thrush); and a 1
per cent cream, for the external treatment of fungal and candidal skin
infections.

Bayer recently supplemented these with the Canesten Combi pack (one
pessary plus a tube of 1 per cent cream) for treating both the cause
and symptoms of thrush.

First-time sufferers should be referred to a GP before being sold
Canesten or other OTC products for thrush. "If there are other symptoms
that are not the normal symptoms of thrush, like pain in the lower
abdomen, there could be a more serious problem, such as pelvic
inflammatory disease, which would need treatment by a GP", Which?
noted.

The magazine's researcher asked for Canesten by name but did not
specify which version she wanted or what it was for. She was detailed
to say, if asked, that she had not used Canesten before, nor had
experienced these symptoms previously. If referred to the pharmacist,
the researcher was to say (again, if asked) that she had not consulted
her GP and that the symptoms included lower stomach pain.

In only one out of 10 cases was the researcher referred to her GP -
after the sales assistant serving her had consulted the pharmacist. In
the one instance where she was served by the pharmacist, the researcher
was asked about her symptoms and described lower stomach pain, but was
not referred to a doctor.

In nine out of 10 cases the researcher was not asked whether she had
used Canesten before. Two of the pharmacy assistants asked no questions
at all before selling the product, Which? found.

In five cases the only question asked by the sales assistant was
whether the customer wanted Canesten cream or pessary. In six cases the
researcher was sold the Canesten 1 per cent cream, "which is the least
effective preparation for treating thrush", the magazine said.

Which? described its findings as "deplorable", commenting that "staff
in all but one of these pharmacies let their customers down badly".

Bayer Consumer Care said it had recognised ever since the original OTC
Canesten was launched that the product required proper consultation.
The company had invested a "huge amount of time and money" in training
courses and distance learning packs for pharmacy staff.

Bayer ran its own anonymous survey at around the same time as the first
Which? report and discovered some confusion in pharmacies about which
version of Canesten to sell. The company had stepped up its training at
that point and would be doing "more of the same", it told OTC Business
News.

It noted that the new Canesten Combi pack, which it says is the most
appropriate format for treating thrush, is performing very well and
appears to be clarifying the issue of product choice for pharmacists.

Tagamet better

Tagamet 100 fared somewhat better, although there was "still plenty of
room for improvement", Which? cautioned.

The exercise was again premised on the potential for drug interactions
- in this case with the anti-asthmatic, phyllocontin. It also picked up
on fears that indigestion in the middle-aged and elderly may be a
pointer to gastric cancer.

The researcher, a middle-aged man, was detailed to tell the pharmacist
or sales assistant that he had not taken Tagamet before nor had
previously suffered from indigestion. This was his first attack and it
had been coming and going for a week.

If asked about other medication, the researcher was to mention
phyllocontin. "The pharmacist should have told him to go and see his
GP. In the meantime, he should not have been sold Tagamet - if any drug
was suggested, it should have been an alternative", Which? said.

In the event, only two out of 10 pharmacists sold the researcher
Tagamet 100 - one without asking any questions and the other despite
being told that the customer was on phyllocontin. Seven pharmacists
offered an alternative to the brand and one refused to sell any drug,
telling the researcher to see his doctor immediately.

Five of the pharmacists instructed the researcher to see a doctor if
his symptoms persisted. But in four cases the pharmacist failed to ask
whether the customer had suffered indigestion before and did not refer
him to a GP.

Diarrhoea/hayfever

Another Which? researcher asked for advice on how to treat diarrhoea.
If questioned, he described symptoms that had persisted for a few weeks
and told pharmacy staff he had recently visited South East Asia - at
which point, Which? said, "he should have been sent to a doctor
immediately. Oral rehydration salts might have helped but anti-
diarrhoeal drugs would not have been much use."

The researcher was "asked all the relevant questions" and told to see a
GP in seven out of 10 cases. In one other instance he was told to visit
his doctor if the symptoms did not abate.

In two of these eight cases the pharmacist or sales assistant refused
to sell the Which? researcher any medicine. In four cases he was sold
oral rehydration salts, in one Imodium (a prescription-to-OTC switch of
loperamide), and in another both Arret (also loperamide) and oral
rehydration salts.

In two cases the customer was not referred to a GP and was simply sold
Imodium.

A hayfever enquiry was designed to test whether someone taking the
antidepressant, amitriptyline, would be steered away from Triludan
(terfenadine), since the two drugs in combination can aggravate heart
problems.

The researcher sought a recommendation for hayfever and in five out of
10 cases, the sales assistant failed to establish that another drug was
being used.

Triludan was sold in five cases, in two of these despite the pharmacist
knowing that the customer was taking amitriptyline. The sales assistant
discussed the request with a pharmacist in six cases.

Pharmacists in crisis?

Under the headline "Pharmacists in crisis", Which? commented: "We have
criticised pharmacists in the past for failing to protect consumers
from the dangers of non-prescription drugs. Unfortunately the service
is still not measuring up ... and now it matters more than ever."

"More and more drugs are coming off prescription and being heavily
promoted by the drug industry", Which? said. "At the same time, over-
secretive licensing laws do not allow the public to know whether such
moves are safe for consumers."

Which? encouraged consumers, in the absence of intervention, to
describe their symptoms to pharmacists as well as any action taken and
whether they were already on medication or had a pre-existing medical
condition.

This advice was welcomed by the RPSGB, which in a statement noted that
pharmacists trying to implement the new protocols "meet with resistance
and in some cases even hostility from some customers who do not wish to
discuss their symptoms".

The pharmacists' body did not agree, however, with all the conclusions
of the Which? report, saying: "In some cases the report had been
critical of the level and content of advice given and of the provision
of products that it would have been perfectly proper for the pharmacist
to supply in all circumstances."

In fact, the survey showed that "the public could have confidence in
the service provided by pharmacists, who in order to help them provide
the best service were now clearly asking for more information from
people requesting a medicine by name", the Society maintained.

It was concerned, however, by the cases where pharmacists appeared to
be asking no questions at all.

Professional judgment

Roger Odd, head of the RPSGB's practice division, said pharmacists had
to make their own assessment of specific cases, in the same way as
doctors. The P medicine protocols were there to provide guidance only.

Nonetheless, the Society is reviewing the protocol situation to make
sure pharmacy staff are aware which questions they should or should not
be asking, Mr Odd told OTC Business News. But the RPSGB does not
anticipate amending the guidelines in the light of the Which? report.

The Society's position was supported by Boots The Chemists (BTC), the
largest pharmacy chain in the UK - although it noted that no Boots
outlets were mentioned in the Which? report.

"The introduction of new protocols in all Boots pharmacies, backed up
by intensive training of all our pharmacy and healthcare staff, is a
major priority for us and we invest in excess of #4 million per year on
Healthcare training", BTC stated.

It also stressed that pharmacists had to use their professional
judgment rather than automatically running through a list of questions.

Customers give out "visual signals" in their interaction with counter
staff, and quite often these will be at least observed by a pharmacist,
commented public relations manager Sharon Buckle. Moreover, if
consumers asked for a specific product, they need not necessarily be
quizzed on whether they had taken it before.

The feedback from BTC's own stores and customers was that the
pharmacist's role was highly valued, Ms Buckle told OTC Business News.

GERMAN PHARMACY SALES UP 3.7 PER CENT

The German market for OTC medicines sold via pharmacies grew by 3.7 per
cent to DM7 billion ($4.9 billion) between September 1994 and August
1995.

Direct supply by manufacturers bypassing wholesalers accounted for 14.9
per cent of the sales by value and 22.5 per cent by volume, according
to data given in the annual report of Anzag.

In its pharmacy business the German wholesaler focuses particularly on
the OTC sector and is hence facing competition from manufacturers that
opt for direct delivery of non-prescription drugs.

However, direct OTC business in Germany declined by 1.4 per cent to DM1
billion at manufacturers' prices last year, Anzag said.

Overall, the pharmaceutical wholesale market expanded by 7.2 per cent
to DM27.3 billion (excluding value added tax) in the year to August
1995, according to Anzag's figures. Growth was more pronounced in
eastern Germany (up 8.2 per cent to DM5.1 billion) than in the western
part of the country (DM22.2 billion, +6.9 per cent).

Anzag's share

Anzag's share of the total wholesale market stands at 16.1 per cent. It
expects to see its turnover lift by 3-4 per cent in the current
financial year, as the German market recovers from the negative impact
of the healthcare reform legislation introduced in 1993.

The company recorded profit after tax of DM32.3 million in 1994/95 -
slightly down on the DM33 million achieved in the previous year - on
turnover of DM4.06 billion.

Peter Haac, chairman of the Anzag board, said the company would further
develop the marketing services it offers to pharmacists.

Of the 8,000 pharmacies supplied by Anzag, 2,000 make use of the
company's marketing package, which combines the delivery of selected
OTC medicines, display materials and customer leaflets with Anzag's
advertising campaigns.

Anzag has been beefing up its OTC advertising strategies since 1994,
mostly through pharmacy displays but also in the print media.

GROWTH SLOWING IN UK MEDICATED SKINCARE?

The UK market for medicated skincare products is maturing, and growth
is expected to slow from an impressive 39.2 per cent in 1990-1994 to
five per cent in the years to the end of the decade.

UK sales reached #89 million in 1994 and should climb to #95 million by
the year 2000, according to a new report by MarketLine, Global
Medicated Skincare.

The surge in value during 1990-94 was largely driven by acne remedies
and therapeutic moisturisers, respectively the largest (37.6 per cent
of total sales) and second-largest (30.5 per cent) segments of the
medicated skincare market, MarketLine says.

Therapeutic moisturisers have been particularly dynamic, growing by a
cumulative 81.3 per cent over the five-year period, but both categories
have been gaining market share at the expense of antifungals, anti-
itching products and haemorrhoid treatments.

MarketLine gives the following estimates for sales and growth by
category in 1990-94:

UK Medicated Skincare Market by Sector
1990-1994 Value vs Growth

              Sales (# million)             % compound

preparations
Total         64.0  71.6  77.3  85.3  89.1        7.4

In the acne remedies segment, Clearasil is the brand leader in a
concentrated market where the top three manufacturers account for more
than 90 per cent of sales.

"Smaller brands are suffering as a result of strong brand recognition
of the major acne remedies and the heavy advertising used to support
such products", MarketLine comments.

It adds that market concentration and the brand loyalties built up
among teenagers generally make for rather static brand shares.

Clearasil, Biactol and Oxy are all advertising heavily to build market
share, the researchers note. They give the following data on
advertising expenditure in the UK medicated skincare market during 1993-
94:

MarketLine believes therapeutic moisturisers will remain the most
energetic segment of the UK market over the next five years.

"Growth in this sector will be due mainly to a move towards premium
products", the researchers predict.
Sluggish performers

The most sluggish performers will be acne remedies, because of a lack
of new products in this area, they say.

FDA APPROVAL FOR ZANTAC SWITCH

Glaxo Wellcome's Zantac is poised to become the third H2-antagonist
option for US consumers in the OTC market for heartburn.

The Food and Drug Administration approved OTC Zantac late last year and
the product will be launched sometime during the first quarter of 1996.

It will be marketed as Zantac 75 (ranitidine hydrochloride 75mg) by
Warner Wellcome Consumer Healthcare in packs of four, 10, and 20
tablets.

Zantac was the third H2-antagonist to be approved for OTC use by the
FDA during 1995: Johnson & Johnson/Merck's Pepcid AC (famotidine) was
cleared on 28 April and SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet HB (cimetidine) on
19 June.

Warner Wellcome is confident, however, that a late start will not deter
it from becoming the market leader.

"The world's leading prescription H2-antagonist over the last five
years is now poised to take its rightful place in the over-the-counter
heartburn market", said Robert Casale, vice president, gastrointestinal
marketing.

$250 million potential

Zantac has generated 200 million prescriptions in the US since 1983 and
Warner Wellcome expects the OTC version to be among those drugs most
frequently recommended by pharmacists.

The product could bring in sales of around $250 million by the end of
the decade, according to UK analysts Paul Krikler and Mark Tracey of
Goldman Sachs International.

They believe Tagamet HB sales in the US are running at "a spectacular
rate of $3 million per week", slightly behind Pepcid AC.

"Broadly speaking, these products have expanded the roughly $1 billion
US market for OTC acid-disease remedies by around 40 per cent to 50 per
cent since their launch earlier this year. We expect further share
gains for these newer products, although this may increasingly come at
the expense of the non-H2-antagonist therapies", the analysts comment.

The Zantac 75 launch will be propelled by the biggest marketing
campaign in Warner Wellcome's history. US advertising is being handled
by J Walter Thompson.

The OTC joint venture expects to repeat its success with Zantac 75 in
the UK market, where sales have overtaken both Pepcid AC and Tagamet
100 despite Zantac being introduced almost a year later than its
competitors.

By its fifth month on the UK market, Zantac had captured a 50 per cent
share of the OTC H2-antagonist segment.

Consumer expectation

Mr Casale noted that US sales of OTC stomach remedies over a 22-week
period rose by 27 per cent after the H2s became available without
prescription. "We expect that growth will continue with the
introduction of Zantac 75", he said.

"Our research has shown that heartburn sufferers are looking forward to
buying a product with the characteristics of Zantac 75: wide
acceptance, prescription heritage and familiarity. We expect that high
consumer expectation will translate into even higher retailer
excitement", Mr Casale commented.

The recommended dose for adults and children aged 12 years and over is
one 75mg tablet, not to exceed two tablets in 24 hours. Zantac 75 will
have no interaction warnings (unlike Tagamet HB) and, when used as
directed, can be taken at the maximum dose daily for up to two weeks.

The Zantac 75 approval came just as Warner-Lambert signed a letter of
intent to purchase Glaxo Wellcome's interest in the Warner Wellcome
joint venture for $1.05 billion (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 36,
page 1).

The companies are also restructuring their marketing alliance for Glaxo
Wellcome's prescription-to-OTC switches, including Zantac. Profits and
marketing costs will continue to be split 50:50, with Glaxo Wellcome
receiving a royalty on sales.

Administration during l995.

These were for the categories of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
(adopted 24 April); cough/cold combinations (27 July); and otic -
swimmer's ear (16 August).

Several monographs are expected to come up by spring of this year.
These include documents on antidiarrhoeals, laxatives, anticaries,
antiflatulents and poison treatments.

Monographs on skin protectants, weight control products and internal
analgesics are also expected to be finalised sometime in 1996.

SIX US SWITCHES IN 1995

The US Food and Drug Administration was remarkably active in approving
prescription-to-OTC switches during l995.

Six prescription drugs, the largest number in over a decade, were
granted approval to switch to OTC status. 1996 also looks promising, as
four drugs have been recommended for OTC switching by FDA advisory
committees.

Stomach remedies led the switch list in 1995, with three winning
approval, followed by two internal analgesics and one treatment for
vaginal yeast infection.

licensed for OTC sale to Whitehall Robins), recommended for approval on
28 September 1995.

* Nicorette, SmithKline Beecham's nicotine gum (2mg and 4mg, licensed
from Pharmacia & Upjohn), recommended on 28 September 1995.

* Pharmacia & Upjohn's hair regrowth treatment, Rogaine (minoxidil 2
per cent), recommended for approval on 17 November 1995.

The dandruff shampoo, ketoconazole, is also awaiting FDA approval. It
was cleared for switching by the agency's advisors on 16 February 1994.

FDA SITS OUT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

The US Food and Drug Administration's OTC drug office had a remarkably
quiet Christmas holiday season. No announcements were made, no meetings
scheduled, no rules promulgated and no enforcement actions reported.

But the inactivity was not, as many thought, a symptom of the historic
US government shutdown, which affected the Department of Health and
Human Services.
History the reason

"History is the reason", explained Don McLearn, FDA deputy associate
commissioner  for public affairs.

The agency's budget falls under the Department of Agriculture, one of
the few departments to receive an appropriation, and the FDA has hence
been fully operational.

While the agency's positioning within the executive branch has been
altered to the relevant departments of health (Health, Education and
Welfare - now the Department of Health and Human Services), its budget
has stayed under agriculture.

The powerful chairs of the Congressional agricultural appropriations
committees have fought successfully over the years to retain
jurisdiction over the FDA budget - primarily to ensure that the agency
would remain concerned with food adulteration and insecticides.
Essential employees

Mr McLearn seemed pleased to explain the FDA's budgetary history rather
than answer the many enquiries he has received about the "essential
nature" of its employees.

The government shutdown required essential workers to report to their
agencies while others were furloughed.

The FDA's critics apparently thought the budget standoff gave them a
chance to learn how many of the agency's employees were 'inessential'.

WHOSE STANDARDS? ADVERTISING IN SOUTH EAST ASIA

If the growth surge in South East Asia has created a ready market for
premium-priced western OTC brands, reaching the consumers with new
money in their pockets can be an uphill struggle.

It is not just a question of geography and the unevenness of
distribution routes across the region. Multinationals complain that
their competitive edge in what consultant Nicholas Hall calls the
"world's fastest growing OTC market" is blunted by cumbersome,
unpredictable and paternalistic controls on advertising.

In common with other regions where a western-style OTC sector is only
just beginning to coalesce, and 'self-prescription' is rife, there are
wide divergences in both the range of products that can be advertised
to the public and the claims that can be made on them.

But one consistent feature of the South East Asian markets is a
preference for pre-vetting of OTC adverts.

Marketers of international brands claim these systems are non-
transparent (and, by implication, protectionist), bureaucratic and
corrupt, with some adverts taking anything from two to eight months to
gain clearance: a potentially disastrous scenario when it comes to
scheduling product launches.

It was hardly surprising, then, to see so much energy spent at the
WFPMM's 2nd Asia Pacific Regional Meeting in Bangkok on promoting the
kind of self-regulatory and message-led framework now installed in the
majority of western markets.
Different priorities?

It could be argued that the health authorities in Thailand and other
South East Asian countries have different priorities from their
counterparts in the more developed OTC markets - that what appears
paternalistic in Western eyes is inextricable from issues of education,
awareness, wealth distribution and regulatory enforcement.

As Margaretha Helling-Borda, director of the World Health
Organisation's (WHO) Action Programme on Essential Drugs, said in
Bangkok, self-medication is about a "whole matrix" of socio-economic
and health factors affecting purchase.

Some, however, view the advertising restrictions in South East Asia as
bureaucracy pure and simple.

One country manager commented to OTC Business News: "In my opinion
external factors such as literacy are not a barrier to a more liberal
advertising environment. Instead, the bureaucracy ... is locked in
regulations which relate to historical accident more than any realistic
assessment of the level of development of consumers."

Moreover, there is a fear that governments in South East Asia may
offset encouragement of self-medication with demands for comprehensive
advertising information on ingredients, usage, side-effects, etc, under
the influence of the WHO's ethical criteria for drug promotion - taking
the opposite path from European countries that have moved to eliminate
full disclosure requirements.

The international industry says the WHO guidelines were formulated by
doctors and largely for doctor, not consumer, promotion. And the
prevalence of doctor dispensing in South East Asia means the profession
has a direct financial stake in resisting any swing to self-medication.

Against disclosure

The arguments against full disclosure were marshalled in Bangkok by
Peter Glynn-Jones, chairman of the WFPMM and managing director,
strategic development for SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare.

OTC advertising can at best convey one or two messages such as the name
and function of the product, he said. Research proves that it is "just
not possible" to inform consumers about contra indications or side-
effects through adverts, Mr Glynn-Jones maintained.

Last August the Pharmaceutical Producers Association of Thailand (PPA)
sponsored an advertisising research project at the Chulalongkorn
University Faculty of Communication Arts. This found that Thai
consumers responded favourably to an "always read the label" direction
on adverts for SmithKline Beecham's cold remedy, Contac 400.

Two other versions of the ad carried either no written instruction or
the full text of labelling for Contac 400 (which is a prescription-only
medicine in Thailand).

On a mean scale, the "read the label" version drew the most positive
reaction in the poll, in which each advert was viewed by 200 out of a
total 600 selected Bangkok residents of mixed age, income, education,
etc.

Nonetheless, 83 per cent of all the respondents saw advantages in
having written texts in OTC adverts (52 per cent of these because they
"provide the right way to take a medicine"), while 72 per cent
identified disadvantages (39 per cent of them because of "too much
information").

This suggests avenues for further research on exactly how much
information is desirable in advertising. At the same time, the
researchers found that 97 per cent of the Bangkok poll obtained medical
information through reading product labelling.
Carte blanche

At present Thailand has no full disclosure requirement for OTC
advertisements. But the broad regulatory authority invested in the Thai
Food and Drug Administration is seen as giving the agency carte blanche
to clamp down on the expressive devices - music, testimonials, 'before'
and 'after' images, depictions of discomfort - conventionally employed
by OTC advertisers in the west.

Exacerbating these restrictions, local sources say, is a refusal to
consider precedents when reviewing advertising applications. Moreover,
any problems that emerge must be cleared up before the FDA will proceed
with the review, adding months to the approval timetable.

At the same time, OTC Business News was told, some companies sidestep
the controls by advertising live on radio in rural areas. "The
international companies feel bound to obey the regulations but the
local companies are more entrepreneurial", one executive commented.

From a multinational perspective, the Philippines offers the most
palatable system. Again there is pre-control but it is administered by
a review board that includes representatives of advertisers as well as
consumer groups, and works with predetermined criteria (eg, are the
claims technically supportable, in good taste, non-disparaging).

The board meets several nights a week and reviews are generally
completed in a single session. An appeals procedure is available if
objections arise once the advertisement has gone public.

Otherwise experience is mixed. Singapore and Malaysia are regarded as
relatively unproblematic, with similar committee systems to the
Philippines if a slightly less brisk turnover of applications. Vietnam
does not regulate veracity or accuracy of advertising content but
applies 'political' censorship.

The divergence of allowable claims or images - for example, an advert
for a stomach remedy may conclude with a smiling customer in one
country and impassively in another if 'relief' cannot be shown -
inevitably adds to the cost of reworking material from market to
market.

Longer-term dividends

For those manufacturers that can build brand loyalty in South East
Asia, the longer-term dividends could be substantial.

Addressing a meeting last summer of the Proprietary Medicines
Association of Australia in Canberra, Mr Hall, chairman and chief
executive officer of Nicholas Hall and Company, predicted that the
total OTC market in South East Asia would double to around $6 billion
by 2004, with growth (from a relatively small base) of 305 per cent in
China and 211 per cent in Indonesia.

A recent report by Euromonitor estimates that the market has expanded
by 46 per cent since 1990, with the Philippines showing the fastest
rate of growth (132.3 per cent) followed by Thailand (110.7 per cent)
and Indonesia (80.9 per cent).

But it would take a hardened optimist to expect any rapid shift towards
a harmonised environment for OTC advertisers in South East Asia. As yet
there is little indication of any regional pattern in drug regulatory
trends.

For example, Singapore's move to switch some 80 medicines from
prescription- to pharmacy-only status, and to make an even larger group
available for general sale, appears an isolated case. In other South
East Asian markets the tendency is still to restrict fairly routine OTC
ingredients to prescription-only use.

One problem, local observers say, is the insularity of drug regulators
in the region. And since the OTC market is as often as not something of
an undefined quantity, there is little incentive to look at how it
operates in other countries.

Moreover, the kind of state-funded healthcare systems that are now
weighing heavily on government finances in Europe have not been the
norm in South East Asia, so there has not been the same economic
rationale for stimulating self-care.

A standardised split into prescription and non-prescription drug
categories might clear some space to define new rules for advertising
OTCs. But the adoption of anything approaching European-style
classification could be years away.

The Thai regulators, for their part, show little sign of modifying the
country's two-stream system of 'dangerous' and 'non-dangerous' drugs.

Non-dangerous products are effectively OTC in Thailand, since they can
be advertised to the general public. But the PPA would rather see a
separate category for self-medication, with formalised procedures for
advertising, labelling, packaging and patient information.

Industry observers say the 'dangerous' classification is a misnomer as
long as products such as oral contraceptives and psychotropics are
freely available in Thai pharmacies.
Global harmonisation?

Even in the European Union, where the advertising Directive (92/28/EEC)
adopted in 1992 has generally liberalised the conditions for OTC
marketers, some member states such as Belgium have clung onto their pre-
control authority in regulating adverts for OTC medicines (this was one
element that the Directive left to national discretion).

Summing up the European regulatory achievements in Bangkok and noting
their considerable impact on legislative reform in Central and Eastern
Europe, Dr Hubertus Cranz, director of the European OTC association,
AESGP, asked if these experiences might not be applied on a global
scale.

In the past, harmonisation in the self-medication market has been
complicated by the strong influence of traditional medicines, Dr Cranz
commented. However, over the last decade the balance has tipped towards
more 'international' OTCs, particularly in the light of consolidation
within the industry and the large market shares captured by
prescription-to-OTC switches.

Dr Cranz suggested that a viable route to worldwide harmonisation might
be standard-setting through guidelines that could be used as the basis
for national procedures. The WFPMM had long since embarked on this
process, through its Guidelines on Drug Promotion.

But it was particularly important that the political climate was right
for broadening the context of harmonisation, he added. "Therefore it is
significant that the WHO recently reinforced its position on the
importance of responsible self-medication and enlarged its statements
on the appropriate use of non-prescription medicines", Dr Cranz said
(see OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 29, page 15).

Nonetheless, he was cautious about the prospects for harmonisation of
advertising regulations.

A great deal of research has been conducted on "reasonable" rules for
advertising OTC products and in particular on the information that can
be conveyed through adverts, he noted.

"Again, in the sense of standard-setting, it might be worth taking
such rules as a basis for considerations in countries which have often,
due to their tradition, been more restrictive", Dr Cranz proposed.

But, he went on to state, there are "certainly many areas in the
regulatory environment of non-prescription medicines which are not
suitable for harmonisation; particularly evident are the areas of
distribution of OTC medicines ... or the systems controlling public OTC
advertising."

A similarly pragmatic line was taken in a panel discussion by Dr Jerome
Reinstein, director general of the WFPMM, who advised against
developing countries moving immediately to a self-regulatory system of
advertising control.

This required the agreement of trade association members to a set of
standards and codes, and some industry associations were not yet strong
or unified enough to achieve this, he commented.

(So far Australia and New Zealand are the only countries in the Asia
Pacific region that have a discrete OTC industry association - Ed).

Moreover, governments in emerging OTC markets must feel that "industry
has earned the right to self-regulation", Dr Reinstein said.
Gulf in interests

The issue is further muddied by the gulf between local and
multinational interests in `developing' markets.

One illustration is the adoption of a self-regulatory Code of Marketing
Practices by the Thai PPA in August 1994 (OTC Business News Vol 1,
Issue 5, page 14).

While the Code is undoubtedly closer to international practice (it is a
requirement of WFPMM membership that member associations have their own
effective advertising code), its real impact is questionable. Not only
are the guidelines more lenient than the government regulations in
force but around 80 per cent of the Thai OTC market is controlled by
non-PPA members.

Many of these are local generic players that, over the years, are
likely to have found ways of working with the pre-control system. The
multinational industry is now focusing on issues of product quality and
information provision in a bid to assert the superiority of its brands
over generic competitors.

A similar national/multinational split is seen in the Philippines,
where one local company holds around 25 per cent of the OTC market.
However, in Indonesia the local industry association has agreed to
collaborate with international companies - a far cry from a few years
back when the multinationals were not even allowed to attend local
association meetings.

The Thai PPA also reports some positive signals from the Bangkok
meeting, with Food and Drug Administration officials requesting copies
of presentations and talking about the need to look at OTC developments
in other markets. A new, younger head of the FDA appointed last October
(Prof Dr Pakdee Pothisiri) is seen as another harbinger of a more
international mindset.

Education or persuasion?

The drive towards regulatory harmonisation in Europe was largely a
matter of market access - the free movement of goods as laid down by
the Treaty of Rome. How much, and indeed whether, consumers benefit
from a broader range of OTC products depends on assumptions about their
ability to make informed choices, with appropriate steerage from
pharmacists or, in some cases, doctors.

These issues are more sharply defined in South East Asia, particularly
as in Indonesia, for example, pharmacies are relatively thin on the
ground and an estimated 35-40 per cent of OTC sales go through non-drug
outlets (see OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 35, page 19).

Mary Murray, who has worked on national drug policies in Australia and
other Asia Pacific markets, warned at the WFPMM meeting that many
consumers in developing countries do not recognise symptoms and rely on
the family unit for guidance. Moreover, both literacy and health
knowledge decline in line with economic status.

And Janne Graham, former chairwoman of the Consumers' Health Forum of
Australia, said recent research in her home country revealed that
people living just above the poverty line had to make "real choices
between medicines and food on a daily basis".

On the contrary, Steven Grossman, senior vice-president and director of
health policy at US advertisers Hill & Knowlton, saw health awareness
benefiting from a more liberal advertising climate.

"I believe that the sophistication of American consumers about health
matters is a result of advertising, not, as some would have it, a
precondition of allowing advertising to occur", he told the meeting.

Mr Grossman went on to argue that wide availability coupled with broad
public knowledge of OTC medicines was likely to check inappropriate
usage - and keep prices down.

"Even when a primary goal of an advertisement is the creation of
immediate product demand, it is usually consistent with public health
goals because the advertising directs the consumer to a product that
resolves their health concern in a safe and effective manner", he said.

Mr Grossman cited a 1992 survey by the Heller Research Group for the US
Non prescription Drug Manufacturers Association, which found that nearly
seven out of 10 respondents preferred, if at all possible, to combat
symptoms without recourse to medication; and that close to nine in 10
US consumers knew medicines should only be taken when absolutely
necessary.

Co-regulation?

But a more co-operative approach to squaring corporate and consumer
interests in OTC advertising was suggested by the Australian system of
pre-clearance.

The committee that assesses compliance with the Proprietary Medicines
Association of Australia's (self-regulatory) Code of Conduct is chaired
by an independent lawyer, with consumer and pharmacy representatives
sitting alongside delegates from the Therapeutic Goods Administration
and the drug industry - not "a committee of our mates", commented PMAA
president David Stephens.

Health consumer groups in Australia had been "naturally suspicious"
about pharmaceutical industry associations monitoring their own
members' compliance with advertising requirements, Ms Graham noted.
Moreover, "there is a real risk from the consumer view that members
will simply resign to avoid sanctions under the code and that outlier
or 'rogue' companies simply will not join", she said.

Two factors, however, had raised confidence in the Australian system,
Ms Graham told the meeting: scrutiny of the PMAA Code of Conduct by the
Trade Practices Commission, which resulted in "the widening of
interests but, most particularly, those of the consumer" on the
compliance committee; and the annual public reporting of complaints and
outcomes.

The co-regulatory spirit manifested in this system and bodies such as
Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council (APAC) was borne out in
recent discussions over indirect advertising of non-sedating
antihistamines.

In this case, both industry and consumer groups saw the value of
'generic' public advertising - with an "ask your chemist" message - to
raise awareness of a more advanced treatment option, Ms Graham
explained. (The products' Schedule 3 (pharmacy-only) status did not
permit advertising to the general population.)

It was agreed that a set of guidelines on indirect adverts should be
incorporated into the PMAA Code of Conduct and, to provide regulatory
ballast, eventually be taken up by the Therapeutic Goods Act.

Here, then, was an instance of industry and consumers moving in tandem
to secure mutual benefit from OTC advertising - and pre-empting the
Australian licensing authority, which has yet to respond.
