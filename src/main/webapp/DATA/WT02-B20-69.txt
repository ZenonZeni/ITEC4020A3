Wide Web Server</a><P>

The Orton Dyslexia Society has two working definitions of dyslexia:<br>
"Dyslexia is a neurologically-based, often familial, disorder which interferes with the
acquisition and processing of language.  Varying in degrees of severity, it is manifested
by difficulties in receptive and expressive language, including phonological processing
in reading, writing, spelling, handwriting, and sometimes in arithmetic.  Dyslexia is not a
result of lack of motivation, sensory impairment, inadequate instructional or
environmental opportunities, or other limiting conditions, but may occur together with
these conditions.  Although dyslexia is life-long, individuals with dyslexia frequently
respond successfully to timely and appropriate intervention."<P>

"Dyslexia is one of several distinct learning disabilities.  It is a specific language-based
disorder of constitutional origin characterized by difficulties in single word decoding,
usually reflecting insufficient phonological processing abilities.  These difficulties in
single word decoding are often unexpected in relation to age and other cognitive and
academic abilities; they are not the result of generalized developmental disability or
sensory impairment.
Dyslexia is manifested by variable difficulty with different forms of language, often
including, in addition to problems in reading, a conspicuous problem with acquiring
proficiency in writing and spelling."<P>

  This digest presents basic information for those providing educational 
services to children with dyslexia who have phonological core deficits.  First 
it provides a brief overview, noting the incidence of dyslexia and the large 
number of these children with phonological deficits which result in far less 
academic progress than experienced by other children with learning disabilities.
A definition of phonological core deficits notes the major components of 
phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relations, and storage and retrieval of 
phonological information in memory.  Several criteria for classification and 
identification of dyslexia and learning disability are summarized and popular 
assessment measures are listed.  Ten suggested interventions are noted, such as 
teaching metacognitive strategies, providing direct instruction in language 
analysis and the alphabetic code, and using techniques that make phonemes more 
concrete.  Also listed are some print resources for teachers, relevant 
associations, and electronic resources.  (DB)<BR>

  Pointing out that the label of dyslexia carries an acute stigma of mental 
incompetence (and the researcher/author is herself dyslexic), this booklet 
intends to provide educators and parents with a frame of reference regarding 
the topic of dyslexia.  Defining dyslexia broadly as "characterized by a 
consistent difficulty with processing phonological information," the book first 
discusses some of the ways in which dyslexia operates, how a diagnosis can be 
made in the classroom, causes of dyslexia, and the necessity of referring the 
child for testing with a reading specialist if consistent dyslexic reading 
patterns are noted.  Chapter 2 presents a history of dyslexia and proposes a 
working definition of the term followed by chapters 3 and 4 directed to the 
parents of the dyslexic child and to the teacher of the dyslexic child.  Next 
chapters 5-8 discuss fundamental reading skills, classroom methods for teaching 
language arts, classroom methods for teaching content areas, and methods for 
handling group work.  The book concludes with a methodology of assessing the 
performance and progression of dyslexic students.  References and a list of 
professional organizations which specialize in understanding dyslexia are 
attached.  (NKA)<BR>

  A descriptive study examined how school districts in Texas identify students 
for dyslexia programs.  Of the 300 districts surveyed, one-third responded with 
a long list of assessment instruments with no clear focus towards a definition 
of dyslexia, nor were notations cited accounting for discrepancies within 
learning achievement and other demonstrations of thinking.  Districts generally 
said they followed the guidelines of the Texas Education Agency and used a 
variety of intelligence tests and achievement tests.  The districts did list a 
number of tests to assess phonological information processed by the individual, 
but none were of recent publication date.  In addition, visual/auditory 
perception, visual motor integration and listening comprehension were all 
important areas of assessment linked to success in language development and 
reading, writing, and spelling.  Perhaps what is important in the end is the 
sense that the learner, not the label, is important.  (Contains 16 references.)

 This practicum focused on the use of repeated taped reading instruction with 
modeling to improve fluency, comprehension, and automatic word recognition in 
five students (ages 11-13 years) with learning disabilities for a period of 10 
weeks.  The instruction also involved the teacher giving corrective feedback and 
having the students answer story map questions both orally and in written form.  
Students' pre-intervention and post-intervention performance was compared in 
oral reading, comprehension, word recognition, and attitude toward reading.  
Results indicated that students improved in comprehension, fluency, and word 
recognition.  The practicum results supported the need to develop a reading 
program that is frustration-proof and failure-proof for use with the 
learning-disabled child.  Appendices include the Heatington Attitude Scale, 
sample story map questions, and samples of students' work.  (Includes 14 
references.) (JDD)  <BR>
