Special Features:  Not just another Madison Avenue boutique.  Bruce Goldstein is a third-generation tobacconist and prides himself, quite rightly, on top-notch service and expertise.  Classy interior, from the glass chandelier to the well-stocked, walk-in humidor.  Goldstein also carries the finest selection of personal humidors in the City, though don't expect any bargains.  Be sure to check out his limited-edition Elie Bleus, particularly the hand-painted models with the portraits of archetypical, beet-mosed cigar smokers (if he's got any left).<BR>

Hours:  Mon.-Fri., 7:45-5:45; Sat., 9-4.<BR>
Special Features:  A warehouse outlet of fine (and not-so-fine) smokes, right in the heart of the City.  The "World's Largest Cigar Store," as the sign proclaims, caters to all ranges and all tastes.  If you're after those rare and cherished cigars, save yourself some time by having a peek at their newly-instituted "Out of Stock" board, just inside the front door.  In addition to a bewildering array of everything smokable, J&R carries a broad selection of their own cigars.  Knowledgeable staff a plus for first-time and veteran smokers alike. <BR>
