<H3>PATRICK ADAMS NAMED PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF KEMPER FUNDS FLAGSHIP GROWTH EQUITY FUND</H3>

<P>
 <B>CHICAGO</B> (June 3) -- In a move designed to further strengthen
its position as a leading equity mutual fund manager, Kemper Funds
management today announced that Patrick S. Adams, 35, has been
named portfolio manager of the $2.6 billion <A HREF="../../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A>,
the company's flagship growth equity mutual fund.  Adams replaces
chief investment officer for equities, Steven H. Reynolds, who
has been the Fund's interim manager since September 1995.  Adams
will report directly to Reynolds.
<P>
 &quot;We are thrilled to have a person of Pat's caliber at the
helm of our flagship growth equity fund,&quot; said Reynolds.
 &quot;His experience as a growth manager and his impressive record
will not only benefit our current Kemper Growth Fund shareholders,
but will enhance our ability to provide consistent, quality, growth-style
investment management expertise.&quot;
<P>
 Adams joins Kemper from Founders Asset Management in Denver,
Colo., where he managed the $400 million Founders Blue Chip Fund
and the $160 million Founders Balanced Fund.  Previously, he was
director of research and senior portfolio manager at
First Of America Investment Corporation, the investment manager
for the Parkstone Group of Funds.  From 1990 to 1992, he managed
the Parkstone Equity Fund, a $600 million growth fund.
<P>
 The addition of Adams to Kemper Funds' equity investment team
is the latest action by Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI),
the investment adviser to the Kemper Funds, in its plan to further
strengthen its  equity investment capabilities.  In August 1995,
a company subsidiary acquired substantially all of the assets
of Dreman Value Management, L.P., enabling the company to provide
retail and institutional clients with an enhanced product offering
that includes the value style of equity investing.  As part of
the acquisition, Kemper assumed management responsibility for
the <A  HREF="../../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A>
and <A  HREF="../../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>. 
Shortly after the Dreman acquisition, Kemper hired veteran portfolio manager Steven Reynolds
from Alliance Capital Management to oversee and direct the company's
equity investment department.
<P>
 In addition to assuming responsibility for the Kemper-Dreman
Funds, the company has also expanded its equity product offering
considerably since August of 1995 by introducing three new funds:
<A  HREF="../../funds/valuegrowth.html">Kemper Value+Growth Fund</A>,
<A  HREF="../../funds/horiz20.html">Kemper Horizon Fund</A> and
<A  HREF="../../funds/europe.html">Kemper Europe Fund</A>.

<P>
 &quot;These bold actions on the equity side of our investment
management business support our company's strategic plan for growth
and success, and we will continue to aggressively implement our
expansion plan to help ensure our position as one of the leading
equity mutual fund managers in the industry,&quot; said Stephen
B. Timbers, chief executive officer and chief investment officer
at ZKI.
<P>
 Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., formerly known as Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., is one of the largest investment managers headquartered
in North America.  Together with its affiliates, ZKI has more
than $79 billion in assets under management.  The company operates
with three strategic business units: retail mutual funds, retirement
plans and institutional asset management.  ZKI is the investment
adviser to the Kemper Funds and is part of Zurich Insurance Group,
a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, that
provides services in life and non-life insurance, reinsurance
and asset management in more than 45 countries worldwide.
