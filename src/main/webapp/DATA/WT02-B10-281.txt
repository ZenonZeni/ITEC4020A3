Brief non-tonal sounds are used in electrophysiology in
the novelty oddball paradigm.  These sounds vary in the
brain activity they elicit and in the degree to which they can
be identified, named, and remembered.  Because ease of sound
identification may influence sound processing, naming and
conceptual norms were determined for 100 sounds for 77 young
adults.  Naming ability decreases in normal and pathological
aging.  Therefore, norms were also derived for older adults and
for probable Alzheimer's disease patients.  With respect to the
young, perseverative naming behavior increased in these groups,
and sound and picture naming performance were correlated.
Finally, The sound naming performance of children aged 5-6,
9-11 and 14-16 years was compared.  Name and conceptual
agreements improved with age, whereas perseverative behavior
decreased. These normative data should be useful in guiding sound
selection in future studies and help clarify the relationships
between sound naming and other variables, including direct and
indirect memory performance.

     in Neuroscan format (*.snd), the sounds in wave format, and the scaled
     (i.e.volume adjusted) sounds in wave format.  Note that the norms were
     derived on the basis of the *.snd sound files.  The wave files are not
     identical due to translation factors.

5)  <A HREF="ftp://156.111.80.180/sys/users/rfmh/pub/research/scaling.txt">SCALING.TXT</A> contains the scaling factors to use with Neuroscan to obtain
     a volume of 92 dB.  Note that the wave and scaled wave sounds need to be
     calibrated for volume, because their actual intensity was not tested in
     our study.
