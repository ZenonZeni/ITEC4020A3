OSTEOPOROSIS DRUGS RAISE HOPES FOR MAKING BONE AILMENT `THING OF THE PAST'

By:
By Michael Smith

   New drugs for osteoporosis -- some slowing bone loss and others building
bone -- will be hitting the market over the next few years and researchers
are optimistic they'll be able to cut the incidence of the disease 
dramatically.
   ``Theoretically, we can make osteoporosis a thing of the past,'' says
Anthony Hodsman, a clinician and osteoporosis researcher at the University
of Western Ontario in London, Ont. ``We have a better chance of removing
osteoporosis from the population than eliminating the cholesterol-related
diseases.''
   Currently, more than one woman in three over the age of 50 suffers
osteoporotic fractures caused by weakened bone. That percentage works out
to an estimated 25 million people in the U.S. As the Baby Boom aged, the
raw numbers had been expected to soar even if the percentage stayed
unchanged but now there's new hope for treatment. Men also suffer from
osteoporosis, but in fewer numbers and with a later onset.
   The body remodels bone continually, tearing it down and rebuilding, much
as the skin is continually made and sloughed off. Like the skin, bone grows
thinner with age as the rebuilding process loses ground. Key players in the
cycle are bone-destroying cells, called osteoclasts, and bone-building
cells, or osteoblasts.
   ``If you reform less bone than is being broken down,'' Hodsman says,
``you ultimately end up with less bone.'' There are two main approaches to
avoid bone loss -- prevent the bone breakdown or stimulate new growth.
``You either work on expenses or you work on income,'' Hodsman says.
   The main approach has been to tackle ``expenses'' -- preventing bone
resorption, or breakdown.
   Estrogen and estrogen-like molecules are perhaps prototypical. In the
absence of estrogen -- after menopause, for example -- bone resorption
gains the upper hand. The obvious solution is to replace the missing
hormone.
   And indeed millions of women across North America and Europe begin
hormone replacement therapy shortly after their menopause, with apparent
success in retaining healthy bone. The problem is that estrogen replacement
has side-effects that make it very unpopular with women -- headaches,
bloating, breast engorgement and, of course, the continuation or resumption
of the menstrual cycle. Estrogen has also been linked to some forms of
breast cancer.
   ``It's not very customer-friendly,'' Hodsman says. Less than 10 per cent
of women take estrogen for any length of time, leading him to say the
therapy is essentially a failure, even though it does prevent
osteoporosis.
   Until a few years ago, hormone replacement was almost the only treatment
option available to physicians. (The hormone calcitonin is approved for
osteoporosis and does increase bone mass, but it must be given by
injection, which is unpopular, and its effectiveness appears to diminish
over time.)
   But a range of new drugs -- the aminobisphosphonates or just
bisphosphonates -- is now reaching the market and their promise is
exciting.
   ``The advantage of the bisphosphonates is that they're entirely specific
to bone, while other drugs act on every tissue,'' says Marc Grynpas, a
biophysicist at the University of Toronto who's studying the long-term
effects of the drugs on bone strength and on body chemistry.
   On the other hand, Grynpas says, a drawback of bisphosphonates is that
they're not particularly well-absorbed by the body. The skeleton gets
perhaps 40 to 50 per cent of injected bisphosphonates and only about half a
per cent of oral formulations.
   The earliest of the bisphosphonates was etidronate, made and marketed by
Procter and Gamble under the name Didrocal. Although etidronate is approved
in many countries as a treatment for osteoporosis, it has never been given
the nod in the United States, largely because the clinical trials did not
attempt to show a reduction in fractures.
   But studies at the University of Western Ontario and elsewhere in the
early '80s clearly showed, Hodsman says, that etidronate increases bone
mass in osteoporotic patients and that was enough to prompt other
pharmaceutical companies to try their own hands at finding
bisphosphonates.
   The first into the market with FDA approval is Merck & Co., with a
bisphosphonate called alendronate and trade-named Fosamax. The company
submitted its NDA March 31 last year and got approval a mere six months
later on Sept. 29.
   Robert Lindsay, who's president of the National Osteoporosis Foundation
and director of the metabolic bone disease unit at St. Luke's Roosevelt
Hospital in New York, called alendronate ``pretty exciting. It gives us a
further option for women who cannot or won't take estrogen.''
   Alendronate is perhaps 1,000 times more potent than etidronate, Hodsman
says, which makes it easier for clinicians to use. A drawback with
etidronate was what Grynpas called its `'narrow therapeutic window'' -- too
little did nothing, too much actually damaged bone. Finding the small gap
between too little and too much was tricky.
   ``Because alendronate is a lot more potent,'' Hodsman says, it overcomes
that problem. ``You can afford to give it every day; it does the same job
as etidronate'' only more quickly and more efficiently.''
   It may even be appropriate to use alendronate and other third-generation
bisphosphonates as a preventive measure, he says.
   A Merck spokesman wouldn't comment on how well sales are going since the
Sept. 29 approval, but said the drug was available in pharmacies very
quickly afterward. The company says a month's supply should cost about $55;
the wholesale price per 10-milligram tablet is $1.39.
   Merck's data, from trials involving nearly 1,000 women, show mean
increases of up to 10 per cent on bone density in the lumbar spine. The
alendronate reduced the fracture rate by 48 per cent compared with the
placebo group.
   Side effects, Merck says, are mild -- abdominal and musculoskeletal
pain, as well as some digestive disturbance -- and generally don't cause
patients to stop taking the drug. In fact, more patients in the placebo
group than the drug group dropped out because of adverse reactions.
   Although Merck temporarily has the field to itself, a wave of
third-generation bisphosphonates is coming down the pipe and they're all,
Hodsman says, ``serious contenders.''
   -- Sanofi Winthrop Inc. has tiludronate in Phase III trials. A spokesman
said a New Drug Application for Paget's disease -- a rare bone degenerative
illness -- will be made soon but couldn't say when the NDA for osteoporosis
would be filed.
   -- Boehringer Mannheim Corp. is in Phase II/Phase III trials with
ibandronate. A spokesman wouldn't speculate on when the trials will
conclude. Interestingly, the company has equipped a Bluebird motor home
with bone-scanning equipment and is using it to conduct the Phase III part
of the trial in rural Montana.
   -- Procter and Gamble Corp. is in Phase III trials with risedronate. A
spokesman wouldn't say when an NDA filing is expected.
   -- Ciba-Geigy Inc. has stopped work on one bisphosphonate and is in what
a spokesman called ``early development'' with another. Ciba is no longer
studying pamidronate for osteoporosis, although it is approved for some
other kinds of bone deficiencies, and is doing preliminary work on
zoledronate.
   The bisphosphonates aren't the only anti-resorptive approach. Eli Lilly
Co., of Indianapolis, is in Phase III trials on raloxifene, which is,
Hodsman says, ``a very interesting drug.''
   Raloxifene, initially developed as an anti-cancer agent, is one of a
group of compounds known as selected estrogen receptor modulators -- they
target different receptors differently.
   Raloxifene appears to block only gender-specific estrogen receptors --
those found in the uterus and breast -- while actually boosting
non-specific receptors. The result appears to be an estrogen-like
inhibition of bone resorption, without the side-effects of estrogen
itself.
   ``It seems fairly close to a magic bullet,'' Hodsman says. ``It might
actually reduce breast cancer risk while doing what you'd like an estrogen
to do -- slow bone resorption'' and thus prevent osteoporosis.
   Kelly Sego, a spokesman for Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, said raloxifene
isn't the only arrow in the company's quiver, although it's the most
advanced. ``We're also looking at any number of derivatives of
raloxifene,'' she said.
   The company's ``best case'' date for an NDA filing would be sometime in
1997, Sego said. Eli Lilly started Phase III trials in January, 1994, and
plans to look at interim data in mid-'96, she said. ``If those data show
what we think they'll show,'' she said, ``then we'll start working on an
NDA.''
   An attack on the other half of Hodsman's equation -- ``income'' or
building bone -- is also imminent. Mission Pharmacal of San Antonio, Texas,
is on the verge of getting the go-ahead to market a slow-release
formulation of sodium fluoride.
   The FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee
recommended approval for the drug Nov. 17, but a company spokesman didn't
know when the final marketing approval would come through.
   Sodium fluoride, in conjunction with calcium citrate supplements, has
long been known to increase bone mass, but it also causes severe
gastrointestinal distress, including gastric ulcers.
   The slow-release formulation -- a honeycomb wax tablet that allows the
mineral to bypass the stomach and dissolve slowly in the intestines --
appears to avoid the harmful side-effects.
   The trials showed a 70 per cent decline in the spinal fracture rate
among treated patients and increases in bone mass in the spine of up to 6
per cent a year.
   There had been fears that bone growth stimulated by sodium fluoride
would be histologically abnormal but Charles Y.C. Pak of the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who conducted the trials,
said, ``We not only found more bone in the patients we studied, but what
appears to be stronger bone.''
   The treatment regime -- 25 milligrams twice a day, combined with 400
milligrams of calcium citrate -- will cost less than $1 a day, a company
spokesman said, making it cheaper than alendronate. However, the
therapeutic window for sodium fluoride is regarded as narrow.
   Meanwhile, Toronto's Allelix Biopharmaceuticals is in the last stages of
a year-long search for an industrial partner for Phase III trials of its
recombinant parathyroid hormone (rPTH). A spokesman said a deal is likely
to be announced in the first two week of 1996.
   The drug -- Allelix calls it ALX1-11 -- has been in Phase II trials at
18 centers across Canada and the U.S. and so far data show it can add
``significant amounts of new bone in osteoporotic patients,'' accord to
John Dietrich, the company's vice-president of research and clinical
development.
   Hodsman said the bone-building effect of PTH has been known since the
'70s, but before Allelix learned how to produce a recombinant form it was
too scarce to be of any use. `'You had to do large studies,'' Hodsman said
-- something that was impossible without large supplies of the hormone.
   He said studies using the hormone -- both recombinant and natural --
have ``consistently shown that bone mass is increased at least as fast as
(sodium) fluoride and fluoride is double the speed of anything else.''
   But the advantage of PTH, he said, is that there's no toxicity and the
bone it builds in patients is probably normal. In animals, bone built by
Allelix's rPTH has been shown to be histologically normal.
   PTH is a major regulator of the speed of bone remodelling, Hodsman says,
but the mechanism isn't completely clear. ``We don't fully understand why
PTH works as well as it does,'' he said.
   For instance, he said, it has been shown that osteoclasts
(bone-resorbing cells) are much less vigorous when they are exposed to
bisphosphonates. ``With PTH, we don't even know as much as that,'' he said.
``It could be it makes osteoblasts more vigorous or it could be that it
recruits osteoblasts'' by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more of
them.
   With all those drugs in the pipeline, people at risk from osteoporosis
have a bright future, Hodsman says: ``We're on the cusp of revolutionizing
the management of osteoporosis.''

HEREDITY PLAYS ROLE IN OSTEOPOROSIS, BUT GENETIC LINK PROVES ELUSIVE

By:
MS

   Heredity clearly plays a role in the likelihood of developing
osteoporosis, but researchers are not entirely sure if there is a direct
genetic key to the disease, according to Laurence Rubin, who studies the
condition at Women's College Hospital in Toronto.
   In 1994, a team of Australian researchers reported that the gene that
codes for the Vitamin D receptor is linked to the speed at which people
lose bone mass as they grow older.
   The Australians, led by John Eisman of the Garvan Institute of Medical
Research in Sydney, say they can predict the approximate age of onset of
osteoporosis depending on which alleles of the Vitamin D receptor gene are
found.
   But other researchers aren't convinced: the September issue of the
Journal of Bone Mineralogy Research devotes space for three articles and
two editorials on the question without, Rubin says, coming to a
conclusion.
   ``The answer is not in yet,'' he said.
   Even without the Vitamin D hypothesis, Rubin says, there's evidence from
twin studies and other population studies that osteoporosis has a
hereditary component.
   But it could simply be that closely-related people tend to have similar
skeletons, according to Anthony Hodsman, a clinician and osteoporosis
researcher at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.
   On that hypothesis, he said, women with small, fragile bones would tend
to develop osteoporosis more than others and so would their close
relatives. But there would not be a single gene or complex of genes that
caused the condition.
   Rubin said the Vitamin D link may turn out to predict accumulation of
bone mass and density during the early years of a person's life. He is
starting a long-term study of 700 young women at Women's College Hospital
to determine, among other things, their Vitamin D receptor status.
   But predicting bone mass may be of limited use: ``Women even at the same
level of bone density fracture at different rates,'' Rubin said. ``The
issue is the quality of the bone.''

AFTER THOUSAND-YEAR SLEEP, LOTUS SPROUTS CHEMISTRY OF LONGEVITY THEORIES

By:
MB

   Ancient lotus seeds, recovered and germinated after lying dormant for
centuries in a dried-out lake bed in China, are giving scientists new
insights into the biochemistry of longevity.
   ``We're interested in what new things the lotus can teach us about
aging,'' not just in plants but in humans as well, said Steven Clarke, a
University of California at Los Angeles biochemist. Clarke analyzed the
chemical make-up of two of seven ancient seeds given to UCLA scientists by
the Beijing Institute of Botany in the early 1980s. These seeds indicate
that, if everything goes right, the potential for cellular life ``is
probably much longer than we thought,'' Clarke said.
   Jane Shen-Miller, a UCLA plant physiologist coaxed a shoot from a lotus
seed estimated to be 1,288 years old. It had been recovered from Pulantien,
China, which had been a lake where lotus plants were cultivated up to about
1484, when, geological records show, an earthquake drained it.
   This seed may be the oldest ``demonstrably viable and directly dated
seed ever reported, the preserved relic of one of the early crops of lotus
cultivated by Buddhists,'' who hold the lotus as sacred, said Shen-Miller.
Other claims of viable seeds found in the relics of antiquity, including
some from King Tut's tomb, could not be confirmed or were hoaxes.
   ``This sleeping beauty, which was already there when Marco Polo came to
China in the 13th century, must have a powerful genetic system to delay its
aging,'' said Shen-Miller, who published a paper describing the germination
of the seeds in the American Journal of Botany last November. Another
lotus plant was grown from a seed 322 years old.
   Clarke said that he was given two of these seeds -- a 95-year-old one
that was able to germinate and a 416 year-old one that was not. When he
broke through the thick skins, he was amazed by ``how healthy the embryos
looked.'' Clarke and a post-doc then ground up the embryos and assayed them
for repair proteins.
   Upon examining the lotus embryos, Clarke found levels of L-isoaspartyl
methyltransferase (MT), a protein repair enzyme, that were equal to those
found in fresh seeds. This enzyme, found in all tissues and especially in
seeds, plays a role in limiting the accumulation of damaged proteins in
storage and may help plants adapt to environmental stresses, such as
drought.
   His lab was the first to identify MT as an enzyme involved in protein
repair. It fixes proteins by straightening out the ``kink in the
polypeptide chain'' that occurs during a cell damaging chemical process
known as isomerization.
   Clarke is currently conducting experiments in various models, and has so
far knocked out the MT gene in bacteria and worms. He found that the
MT-deficient organisms do not last as long as those with an intact gene.
His lab is moving on to mouse experiments.
   In other research, Clarke is gathering blood and cheek cell samples from
healthy people over age 85. He is looking at the levels and quality of
repair MT in these people, using PCR to find variants in the MT gene, which
is located on chromosome 6.
   ``Do they make it because they have a super efficient variant of this
enzyme?'' he said.
   On the flip side, studies of fibroblasts from victims of progeria, a
disease of abnormally rapid aging, have shown no difference in MT levels.
   Although MT appears to be an important contributor to longevity, Clarke
points out that the enzyme is most likely just one of many of the lotus
seeds' life-preservers.
   ``These seeds survived because everything went right,'' said Clarke.
   The tough outer skin that provides an air- and water-tight chamber for
the embryos was one important element in their survival, wrote Shen-Miller.
The scientists also found high levels of ascorbic acid and glutathione, two
agents that are effective in maintaining functioning proteins.
   Clarke anticipates that scientists are going to identify many more
repair enzymes.
   ``What we may find is that our repair kits are a lot more effective than
we thought,'' said Clarke, whose lab is looking at protective strategies in
several different kinds of plants. Clarke hopes that further study of the
lotus, which has been used for thousands of years in Chinese pharmacopoeia,
may reveal other secrets of its longevity, including some of the other
enzymes that repair damaged proteins.

RESEARCHERS FIND GROWTH HORMONE A DRY HOLE IN SEARCH FOR FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH

By:
By Mike Pezzella

   A decade ago genetic engineering made human growth hormone available in
large quantities and opened a floodgate of claims that the Fountain of
Youth was about to flow into the world.
   While recombinant human growth hormone, rhGH, has helped some children
with growth problems -- at a price of $10,000 to $30,000 a year -- it
hasn't banished wrinkles or the decrease in muscle protein mass, strength
and bone mineral density that shows up in the decades after 60.
   ``If you take growth hormone, maybe it makes you look younger, but
you're gaining fluid. You're filling in the wrinkles, you fill them up with
fluid,'' said Dr. Kevin E. Yarasheski, of the Metabolism Division and
Section of Applied Physiology at Washington University School of Medicine,
St. Louis, Mo.
   Yarasheski and his colleagues at Washington, Jeffrey J. Zachwieja, Jill
A. Campbell and Dennis M. Bier, studied the effect of growth hormone in
older men.
   The 23 men ranging in age from 64 to 75 followed a 16-week program of
resistance exercise that went from moderate to high intensity in
combination with administration of growth hormone or a placebo. The purpose
was to see if growth hormone (GH) treatment would result in a greater
increase in muscle strength, whole body and skeletal muscle protein
synthesis rate, or a greater reduction in fat mass and myofibrilar protein
breakdown rate in older men than an identical training program without GH.
   Instead of the fountain of youth, Yarasheski and his team found a pool
of fluid. During the study GH treatment was cut off to several of the
participants who developed symptoms of carpal tunnel compression and fluid
retention in hands and feet. Eight of the 13 GH recipients were able to
complete the 16-week course of the study.
   ``We found that GH produces no gain in strength or muscle mass without
exercise,'' said Yarasheski.
   The result in the study of older men duplicated results Yarasheski got
in a similar 1992 study of young men. Then, Yarasheski monitored 18 men
ranging in age from 21 to 34. They were followed on a 12-week course of
heavy resistance exercise training using Nautilus equipment.
   ``No one has ever measured fluid retention in past studies that show
weight or mass gain in growth hormone use. People might link greater body
mass and lack of wrinkles with youth. So when they retain fluid and put on
extra weight they associate that with the feeling of well-being they had
when they were younger,'' said Yarasheski.
   ``What they are doing probably is filling in the wrinkles with fluid,
they are not getting rid of the effects of aging,'' said Yarasheski.
   He did admit that the ``filling in'' of wrinkles can produce at least a
short-term change in appearance that might make someone sensitive to aging
feel better. But when it came to discussing muscle building, Yarasheski was
definite: ``Lean tissue? No, it is fluid retention.''
   ``We used the Genentech hormone, it's just about the same as the Lilly
hormone,'' said Yarasheski.
   Yarasheski is currently completing a third growth hormone study
involving women as well as men. This time the subjects are not being made
to exercise because the researcher said he is beginning to think that GH
``doesn't add anything'' to the subjects.
   ``Exercise is so powerful, that it creates an effect that either
overshadows the effect of growth hormone or it creates the entire
beneficial effect itself,'' said Yarasheski.
   The current study involves more than 30 individuals including eight or
nine women. He said the Washington University team has found that women
respond to growth hormone ``pretty much the same as men,'' in previous
studies.
   There has been no gain in strength or muscle mass without exercise.
   Yarasheski said that he is puzzled by why growth hormone treatment does
not produce a marked effect.
   He said that it may be that scientists have not yet learned how to set
the proper dosage for the hormone. He also speculated that exercise may
produce such a powerful effect on the body that it cancels out everything
else when it is in use. He also said that scientists have theorized that
as yet unknown individual characteristics may decide who will respond to
the hormone or that the hormone is a short-term drug against which the body
develops an immunity. That would explain why young subjects respond to GH
therapy and why adults and older people apparently do not.
   Yarasheski is currently writing the paper on his latest GH study and
expects to have the results about the use of the drug on women and men who
did not exercise ready to publish by the end of 1996.
   In the meantime the hormone treatment is being marketed by mail-order
from the Bahamas via slick magazine ads from Palm Springs as a way to
extend life, increase bone and lean muscle mass and improve cardiac
function.
   If nothing else, Yarasheski said, the fluid retention can make people
feel better about themselves because they may look more like they did when
they were young. What the scientist called a kind of mirror therapy.
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Genentech, maker of the hormone used by
Yarasheski, said the company was doing no work on use of their product in
the aging.
   ``We work very closely with Genentech, but we are not giving them the
answers they want,'' said Yarasheski. ``But those are the answers we are
getting.''

MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH TO TAKE NEW DIRECTION IN '96

By:
RR

   Last year, two clinical trials of biotech drugs to prevent age-related
macular degeneration ended with negative results. But others may begin
with different drugs within the next 18 months, according to the study
chairman of an international macular degeneration study group.
   Age-related macular degeneration, which progressively leads to
blindness, affects approximately 600,000 Americans each year. The
condition is characterized by a loss of sight due to functional
degeneration of light-sensitive, retinal nerve cells at the back of the eye
that distinguish fine detail at the center of a person's field of vision. 
The less common ``wet'' type of the disease, involving abnormal
blood-vessel growth, quickly leads to blindness, compared to the more
common ``dry'' form, which has a much slower onset but sometimes converts
to the ``wet'' disease.
   In April, Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., announced
the cancellation of its macular degeneration program when interim data from
a Phase II trial found no significant effect from its transforming growth
factor (TGF) beta-2 product, BetaKine (see BTNW, May 17, '93, p. 10). In
fact, the pullout resulted in a subsequent restructuring of the company --
and the departure of Celtrix's original President and Chief Executive
Officer (CEO), Dale Stringfellow, who now works at Berlex Laboratories on
unrelated projects.
   Celtrix's new President/CEO, Andreas Sommer, said work with BetaKine
will probably continue on a substantially different ophthalmologic disease:
macular holes.
   ``There is a fairly good rationale'' for using the tissue-repair
capability of the drug there, Sommer said. ``It appears that TGF-beta has
some repair activity on this hole. In macular degeneration there is no
such thing.'' He said macular degeneration is a ``very complex process
that is unrelated to tissue repair.''
   In November, the Pharmacological Therapy for Macular Degeneration Study
Group (PTMDSG), comprising 53 centers worldwide, ended a placebo-controlled
trial, involving 53 centers worldwide, of Hoffmann-La Roche's interferon
alpha-2a (Roferon-A) in 500 elderly patients with the ``wet'' form of
macular degeneration.
   PTMDSG study chairman David Guyer, who runs the retinal program at the
Manhattan Eye, Nose and Throat Hospital in New York City and is a clinical
associate professor at Cornell, said ``it's going to be a negative study''
when the results are put together and reported in the literature.
   Interferon was ``shown in the test tube to stop abnormal blood vessels
from growing,'' he said, ``and it works for vascular tumors in humans to
cause regression of blood vessels, so there was strong, scientific
rationale'' for the trial. However, he said, ``it may have just been that
not enough drug penetrated'' the retina to make a significant difference. 
``It's very hard to know why it didn't work.''
   However, Guyer said, ``there are future studies with other companies
that haven't been announced.'' Within the next 18 months, he said, ``I'd
expect one and maybe two major studies on synthetic drugs, potentially, to
be started. We should know in the next two months or so if they will be
funded or not.''
   Guyer said ``there are two good candidates,'' and perhaps ``three or
four others, depending on further testing,'' to go into new clinical trials
for age-related macular degeneration. One -- a new biotech drug that he
would not name -- is an ``extremely good candidate,'' he said. But the
company that developed and owns it must first ``agree on an expensive
program to go forth on it,'' he said. The company must ``first agree that
they're going to increase production, do all the safety studies, etc., etc.
So it's a huge cost to them. My feeling is, I think they're going to go
with this one.''
   ``We should hopefully know within the next four to eight weeks'' whether
or not it will proceed, Guyer said.

ON THE TRAIL OF APO E GENE IN THE BRAIN, LOOKING FOR ALZHEIMER ORIGINS

By:
By Marjorie Shaffer

   Like detectives gathering evidence at the scene of a crime, researchers
are tracking the footprints of the polymorphic apo E gene in the brain,
hoping to find the mechanisms that lead to the destruction of neurons, the
tangles and the plaques peppering the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
   The search is yielding tantalizing clues to the origins of the most
common cause of dementia in the elderly, and may one day provide a way to
actually prevent or slow a disease that is said to be the fourth-leading
cause of death in the United States. Some four million Americans have
Alzheimer's, and the disease kills 100,000 people annually. It typically
strikes after the age of 65.
   The research is also providing a possible window into other kinds of
dementia associated with AIDS and the loss of memory associated with
aging. Although much of this research is still in its infancy, the efforts
being made to understand Alzheimer's will undoubtedly help unlock the
mysteries of other diseases that tear the tissues of reality and memory.
   And, perhaps most importantly, the research reveals that Alzheimer's and
other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging, are not caused by
one factor like a bacteria or a virus, but are a result of multiple factors
that produce multiple forms of a syndrome.
   ``Aging isn't the explanation for the loss of memory. Instead, memory
loss is a biological mechanism, perhaps a disease process, that we need to
understand,'' said Zaven Khachaturian, the longtime director of Alzheimer's
disease research at the National Institute on Aging, who is now an
independent consultant in Bethesda, Md.
   ``We don't know of a way to prevent any of the dementias and I don't
find it useful to categorize the dementias into different forms,'' said
Khachaturian. ``It is a generic problem that in all cases involves a loss
of neurons in a particular part of the brain. The solution is to find a way
to slow down the process in Alzheimer's, and once we find that we could
apply it to other diseases. We need to attack the fundamental process to
insure that neurons remain functioning for a lifetime,'' he said.
   In healthy individuals, overall, there are some changes that occur when
the brain ages, although the evidence is still murky, according to Barry
Gordon, director of the department of cognitive neurology at Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine. The hippocampus, for example, an important
area linked to learning and memory, may become less effective, and there
may be a loss of neurons in the cortex, said Gordon.
   ``But this is a very controversial topic. The old saw about losing
10,000 brain cells a day in the cortex is simply wrong. It is very tough to
count brain regions, and we don't lose nearly as many neurons in the cortex
as people once thought.
   ``The most universal phenomenon of age is slowing,'' said Gordon. ``When
we age we don't necessarily lose our memory, we slow down, our thought
processes take longer.''
   In contrast, the dementia associated with Alzheimer's is far more
profound. It affects not just memory, but language, concentration and many
other aspects of ``cognition.''
   Researchers are taking a variety of approaches to attacking the
Alzheimer's disease process, but most are in some way linked to the apo E
polymorphism. In one of the latest research advances, a team led by Judes
Poirier at McGill University found that Alzheimer's patients who didn't
carry the apo E4 allele, the so-called ``bad'' form of the protein,
responded dramatically to Cognex, a medication that increases the amount of
the nerve messenger acetylcholine in the brain. Neurons producing the
brain chemical degenerate in Alzheimer's patients and the chemical is
crucial to learning and memory.
   Another retrospective study by Martin Farlow at the University of
Indiana found the same correlation between the apo E genotype and the
response to Cognex.
   ``Dr. Poirier's observation is exciting but extremely preliminary,''
said Norman Relkin, director of the memory disorders program at Cornell
University Medical Center. ``It needs to be replicated by other groups and
has to be tested in a prospective fashion,'' he said.
   The exact role of apo E itself is still not understood, but the protein
is made mainly in the liver and it shuttles cholesterol among the body's
cells. It is also produced in the brain, and there it has been linked to
regeneration and repair of neurons, among other possible roles. Recently,
for example, Allen Roses' group at Duke University found the protein in the
post-mortem brain tissues of normal, non-demented individuals as well as in
the tissues of Alzheimer's patients. Apo E has also been found in the
amyloid plaques of the disease, and the protein has been implicated in the
formation of tangles in the brain that are composed of a mutated form of a
common protein called tau.
   Two years ago the Duke University group reported a link between apo E
and Alzheimer's disease and since then many studies have verified the
original finding. The three forms of apo E, 2, 3, and 4, are now linked to
different probabilities of getting the disease: in the worst case two doses
of apo E4 are associated with the highest risk. Yet the picture is
complicated. Because there are three alleles of the same gene, there are
six possible combinations of apo E, and form number 2 may even protect
against the disease. Furthermore, some 10% of individuals with two doses of
apo E4 will not get the disease.
   Some experts estimate that roughly 40% to 60% of Alzheimer's disease
patients are apo E4 carriers; and about 80% of the general population may
carry at least one dose of E3. But tests for apo E are only recommended
as an additional piece of information for individuals who are already
experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer's, according to Neil Buckholtz, acting
associate director for neuroscience and neuropsychology at the National
Institute of Aging. ``This whole issue of apo E isn't clear yet at all,''
said Buckholtz. ``Large-scale epidemiologic studies need to be done, and
testing isn't recommended for people who don't have symptoms,'' he said.
``Apo E4 interacts with tau protein and AB protein in plaques and a
tremendous amount of research is now being done to either block apo E4 or
mimic apo E2.''
   Other groups are devising ways to prevent the deposition of the small
protein called AB peptide that is the main component of the amyloid plaques
of Alzheimer's. And still other groups are testing new compounds that
increase the production of acetylcholine or corticotropin releasing factor
in the brain, or regulate calcium in neurons.
   Possibly a definitive treatment for Alzheimer's may require several
approaches, mirroring the disease itself, according to Gordon of Johns
Hopkins. ``It is likely that what we call aging is a whole series of
problems. If you own a car, as it ages a lot of things go wrong,'' he
said.

REACHING 100: IS IT TORTOISE MEAT, MARTINIS OR GENES?

By:
By Mara Bovsun

   What's the secret of long life?
   Ask any centenarian and you'll hear a lot about sturdy ancestors,
healthy habits and an upbeat attitude. One 114-year-old African woman
reportedly attributes her age to a diet of pumpkin seeds, locusts and
tortoise meat. Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, the world's oldest human being
at over 120, advises people to ``Always keep your smile.'' Broadway legend
George Abbott who died last year at 107, said his secret was: ``Have fun,
and go home when you're tired.''
   Then there's 99-year-old comic George Burns whose longevity prescription
includes 10 to 20 cigars and three to four martinis a day, along with a
passion for his work.
   ``And I don't eat spinach,'' he told Larry King in an interview last
July.
   While gerontologists try to find some pattern in the daily habits of the
oldest old -- people who were born in the last century -- biochemists armed
with the new tools of molecular biology are looking for chemical and
genetic bases of long, long lives.
   What they've found so far appears to be the molecular equivalent of
tortoise meat and martinis.
   ``What we don't know is really overwhelming,'' said molecular biologist
David B. Finkelstein, director of the pathobiology program at the National
Institute on Aging (NIA), which devotes roughly $450 million annually to
the study of growing old, from neurological degeneration to genetics. Of
that total, up to $60 million goes to the program on the biology of aging,
focusing on the cellular and genetic mechanisms that lead to signs of
physical old age -- compromised immune systems, wrinkles, blindness, muscle
loss, bone thinning and dementia.
   Although modern theories of aging go back at least 30 years, when
Leonard Hayflick posed his idea that the lives of cells are measured by a
molecular clock, Finkelstein said there's a need for much more research --
and new researchers -- before any of the current concepts can be proven.
   ``At this point we know, the one thing we know for sure, no doubt, is if
you calorically restrict an animal, it will live longer and be healthier,''
said Finkelstein. In flies and rodents, cutting food intake by 30 percent
extended life. Studies in primates are just getting underway, led by
researchers at the University of Wisconsin and at the Gerontology Research
Center in Baltimore. Finkelstein said that the hope of researchers is to
find out what kinds of physical reactions are triggered by caloric
restriction, so that scientists might be able to replicate them.
   The goal of these scientific inquiries, say scientists, is not simply to
extend life span, but to delay for as long as possible the onset of disease
and disability. In 1992, diseases afflicting Americans over the age 65
accounted for nearly 38 percent of the national health care bill of $800
billion, according to a report by the American Federation for Aging
Research (AFAR) and the Alliance for Aging Research.
   ``If the option is to have everyone live to 120, and the last ten years
of their life to be in a wheelchair, with Alzheimer's and immobilized, who
wants it?'' said Dr. Finkelstein.
   In this century, improved nutrition, sanitation and medical care raised
the average life expectancy from 49 years to 76 years. By the year 2,000,
that life expectancy will be about 85 years and more and more people seem
to be hitting the century mark. In 1970, the U.S. census counted only about
3,300 people who had made it to 100. By 1990, there were more than 35,000
centenarians
   But there is a vast difference in their health and how they live. Some
are so vital that they continue to work and even participate in sports,
such as one 100-year-old swimmer who competes in the backstroke in the
Senior Olympics. Others are simply holding on to life, confined to
wheelchairs and nursing homes.
   One important question that must be answered is ``what is normal aging
and what is pathological?'' said Finkelstein. Studies -- such as the
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) at the Gerontology Research
Center in Baltimore -- are trying to establish benchmarks for what can be
considered normal in healthy old people. BLSA has about 1,100 active
participants, said Finkelstein, who come in every year or two for a battery
of tests.
   The NIA is planning to start a study of the ``oldest of the old,''
establishing a cell bank of those unusual people who reach 100. 
Finkelstein said that it will most likely get started in the next few
years, after the agency has determined how to handle the ethical issues
involved with collecting samples and obtaining informed consent. In France,
scientists at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine have established
a cell bank of their oldest citizens and are already looking for genes that
are common to them.
   Finkelstein said that the NIA is funding several lines of research in
the genetics of aging. A lot of backing is going into investigations into
genes that produce super oxide dismutase (SOD), a mechanism that protects
cells against oxidative damage.
   Another hot area is advanced glycosylation, a process of binding
proteins and glucose molecules, he said. ``This has been a very eclectic
area until people discovered receptors that can identify these advanced
glycosylation products,'' said Finkelstein. Glycosylation may be related to
heart disease, and researchers have compounds to reverse this process in
clinical trials. Other NIA-funded research has found several genes
connected with longevity in C. elegans, a microscopic worm, and yeast.
   The theory of the telomere clock has aroused considerable excitement in
recent years, both for its relationship to aging and its impact on cancer.
Telomeres are DNA repeats -- TTAGGG -- at the tail end of chromosomes. Each
time cells divide, the strands become shorter, until the cells reach a
stage when they enter senescence and are no longer dividing. Research
indicates that such cells accumulate, producing substances that result in
the breakdown of healthy tissues.
   Geron Corp., a biotechnology company in Menlo Park, Calif., has been
conducting research for several years into the role of telomeres in aging
as well as the role of an enzyme, called telomerase, in the process of
immortalizing cells, which turns them cancerous.
   In a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, Geron researchers reported that telomere length can be used as a
marker for human vascular aging, implying that the accumulation of
senescent endothelial cells may contribute to clogging of the arteries and
blood clotting.
   According to Geron's Calvin B. Harley, the research is the ``first
evidence utilizing the techniques of telomere biology to suggest that the
aging of vascular cells contributes to atherosclerosis and possibly other
cardiovascular diseases.'' Measuring telomere length might be a useful
method of predicting the onset of atherosclerosis.
   The impact of these senescent cells on the body is key area of
investigation, said Finkelstein.
   ``We know cells become senescent in vitro. We only have recent evidence
that they become senescent in vivo as well.''
   Rather than simply lying dormant, these non-replicating cells exude
substances that damage surrounding cells and cause age-related problems.
   Judith Campisi, a senior scientist at Berkeley National Laboratory, is
one member of a scientific team that developed a simple, rapid test for
senescent cells, and the accumulation of these cells, in living organisms.
The assay measures levels of the enzyme beta-galactosidase (BG), which is
produced by senescent cells. Until now, the only way to study cell
senescence was to culture cells until they stopped replicating.
   This fast, inexpensive assay allows researchers to find senescent cells 
by determining whether the enzymatic marker is present.
   Specific cell types have their own markers indicating senescence, said
Campisi. In skin cells, for example, an enzymatic marker is the
over-production of collagenase, an enzyme that breaks down collagen,
causing the skin to collapse. Wrinkled skin is one result of this
mechanism, she said.
   Scientists are exploring strategies to reverse the properties of
senescent cells responsible for age-related destruction, without igniting
the cell's replicative powers. If that were to happen, the result could be
uncontrolled cell growth -- cancer.
   ``The idea of balance has to be taken quite seriously,'' she said.
   Geron is working in this area, and has licensed the BG test for use in
its program to find drugs to modulate the phenotype of senescent cells.
   Premature aging conditions -- such as progeria -- are also offering a
glimpse into the biology of longevity. These rare syndromes may be caused
by a defect in a single gene, making them easier to study than normal
aging, which is most likely controlled by a complex of genes.
   Genetics of aging expert George M. Martin has established a registry of
people suffering from Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease that
causes 20-year-olds to develop age-related ailments such as premature
balding, osteoporosis, heart disease and diabetes. The gene for this
syndrome has been tracked to chromosome 8, and scientists believe they are
closing in on it. Martin, professor of pathology, adjunct professor of
genetics and director, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of
Washington, Seattle, is also investigating the genetic basis for
susceptibility and resistance to Alzheimer-type dementia as well as looking
at the somatic mutations that break down cells.
   Overall, researchers in aging seem to be traveling down two paths --
those exploring aging as an accumulation of cellular insults -- such as
oxidative damage -- and those seeking inborn mechanisms that pre-set
cellular life-span, said T. Franklin Williams, scientific director of AFAR,
which has devoted about $13 million over the past 14 years to scientists in
the field and has earmarked another $20 million to support scientists over
the next five years.
   Most likely, he said, a person's life span will be determined by a
combination of genetic programming and cell damage.
   ``We all have a mix of factors that will eventually do us in,'' said
Williams. ``It is a very individual matter as to what the ultimate life
span will be.''
   For now the outer limit for the life of one human being appears to be
around 110, with few, like Jeanne Calment, stretching it, to the
bewilderment of scientists, for up to a decade more.

ARTHRITIS RESEARCH: DRUG COMPANIES FOCUS MOSTLY ON RHEUMATOID

By:
By Reginald Rhein

   The two major forms of arthritis -- rheumatoid and osteoarthritis --
both are inflammatory diseases of the joints. But they are very different
diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, can strike at
any age; it most commonly affects the joints of the hand, wrist, elbows and
shoulders. Osteoarthritis (OA), considered a disease of aging, attacks
only the cartilage, and most often causes disability in the knees, hips,
and spine.
   Many companies are trying to develop drugs against RA, but only a few
are specifically tackling OA, even though the potential market is more than
six times as large (16 million Americans have OA vs. 2.5 million with RA). 
Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been
the first line of therapy for both conditions since the beginning of the
century, and most clinical trials still involve NSAIDs. The Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lists 20 companies with drugs
in clinical trials against RA and seven for OA, with five of the drugs in
trials for OA also in RA trials.
   Part of the lack of interest by biotechnology companies in OA was that,
until very recently, OA was considered the result of ``wear and tear'' of
aging joints, while RA -- caused by the body's immune system attacking the
synovium, or joint lining -- was considered potentially more amenable to
intervention with biotech drugs. Thus, clinical trials with monoclonal
antibodies or other drugs have attempted to block RA's autoimmune cascade,
which starts with the release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by macrophages, and
continues when the IL-1 and other stimulatory factors ``dock'' to the
receptor molecules on other immune cells -- or on cartilage or bone cells
-- and trigger the release of enzymes that ultimately destroy the synovium
membrane. No similar therapeutic targets were thought to exist for OA.
   ``Osteoarthritis is a problem of articular cartilage, which is the
gliding surface of the joint,'' said Steven Trippel, professor of
orthopedic surgery at Harvard University and Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``The difficulty of that disease -- at least viewed from one
perspective -- is that the homeostasis, which is the balance between
degradation and repair, is lost.
   ``In normal tissue, in almost every tissue in the body, there is some
turnover of the tissue occurring,'' Trippel said. ``That's true in
articular cartilage as well. And the matrix, the material that is the
rubbery, very slippery gliding surface that allows the joint to function
properly in a normal joint, is slowly turning over. That means that you
could view osteoarthritis as the failure of the balance between repair and
degradation of this matrix.''
   Trippel suggested that biotechnology could be used to inhibit the loss
of the matrix. ``One way of doing that would be to use gene therapy,'' he
said. ``Another way would be to use medication or already-fabricated gene
product that could be put into the joint or delivered to the body in some
other way. But the principle would still be the same; that is, to try to
inhibit the loss of matrix which characterizes the disease.''
   The second approach, Trippel said, is to ``increase the repair side of
the homeostasis equation.'' For this, growth factors could be sought that
act on articular cartilage to enhance repair -- and perhaps slow down or
even reverse the process of osteoarthritis. ``That would be really
exciting,'' he said.
   ``There is work going on in this area, trying to understand the effect
of growth factors on articular cartilage,'' Trippel said. ``But to my
knowledge there is no good experiment out there that shows, definitely in
an animal model, for example, that if you give a single growth factor that
you can correct the disease.''
   Several OA studies in animals are currently underway, however, including
a gene-transfer study in rabbits, which is being undertaken by Christopher
Evans, associate professor of orthopedic surgery and molecular genetics and
biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
   ``The OA work is part of a larger program where we're trying to use gene
transfer techniques to address a number of joint diseases, including both
rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, as well as to enhance the repair of joints
following injury,'' Evans said. His group has focused on the synovium
articular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments, he said. ``In the context of
OA, I guess, the key one is the articular cartilage,'' Evans said. ``We're
in the process of transferring various genes, both marker genes and
potentially helpful genes, into the articular cartilage of rabbits.''
   Evans said he has ``toyed with the idea'' of transferring
metalloprotease inhibitors to rabbit joints, since metalloprotease is
specifically associated with OA, but ``we've not given that a priority.'' 
Most of the group's early work was in RA, where anti-inflammatory genes
were put into synovium. ``Just in the past couple of years we've expanded
into OA,'' he said.
   For Trippel, the ``best'' and ``most encouraging'' animal study he has
seen is one by Richard Rogachefsky and his colleagues at the University of
Miami School of Medicine and the University of Texas Health Science Center
at San Antonio. ``That group showed that if you gave a particular growth
factor called insulin-like growth factor 1, IGF-1, with an additional
molecule that influences the effect of IGF-1, you could actually help
prevent osteoarthritis in a canine model,'' said Trippel. The study,
published in the Journal of the Osteoarthritis Research Society --
Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (Vol. 1, 105-114, 1993) -- found ``in a model
of mild OA, therapeutic intervention with IGF-1 and PPS [sodium pentosan
polysulfate] appeared to successfully maintain cartilage structure and
biochemistry.''
   For Brian Butcher, group vice president for research at the Arthritis
Foundation in Atlanta, Ga., ``probably the most exciting thing that's
happened in the past few years'' in OA has been the discovery by Darwin
Prockop, who directs the Jefferson Institute of Molecular Medicine at the
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, of a gene associated with
osteoarthritis. About three years ago, Prockop isolated a point mutation
in a type II collagen gene in members of a family prone to developing
early-onset OA. All those with the disease had the mutant gene, while all
those without the gene did not have OA. Prockop said he has now scanned
about 40 other families and found the gene in about 3 percent of OA
patients. He estimated that about 10 genes are involved in making the
proteins responsible for strong cartilage.
   Prockop said he is currently participating in a gene therapy trial of a
related disease, osteogenic imperfecta (OI), at St. Jude's Hospital for
Children in Memphis. He wants to successfully complete this trial before
attempting to correct the genetic defect in OA patients, since OI is a far
more serious affliction than OA. In the OI trial, bone-marrow cells will be
removed from the patients, normal genes will be inserted ex vivo, and the
cells will be replaced in the patients' cartilage, Prockop said.

OSTEOPOROSIS COLLABORATION FOR CHUGAI, LILLY

   Eli Lilly Japan K.K. -- wholly owned Japanese subsidiary of Eli Lilly
and Co. (U.S.) -- and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. (Japan) have reached
agreement on the joint development and marketing of raloxifene
anti-osteoporosis agent for which Eli Lilly is conducting clinical testing
in the West and Japan.
   The deal was announced at a press conference in of the presidents of
both companies held December 13 in Kobe. According to the announcement,
raloxifene is a new-type anti-osteoporosis agent claimed not to have the
side effects conventional equivalents have. It is now in phase-II clinical
testing in Japan and manufacturing approval will be sought in three to four
years.
   Raloxifene, dubbed a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM), acts
against osteoporosis during and after climacterium by stimulating bone
metabolism and fatty metabolism in the same way that the female hormone
estrogen does, but is free from the side effects of causing cancer of the
breast and uterus, which estrogen is suspected of inducing, the
announcement said. It is said that in Japan there are roughly 2 million
patients afflicted with osteoporosis as well as 5 million persons likely to
be afflicted, offering a market of about $1.1 billion in fiscal 1994,
   President O. Nagayama of Chugai said the two firms will soon form a
team to promote clinical development of the new drug in Japan. They will
also consider linking up with each other for therapies for other bone
diseases. Commenting on the collaboration with Chugai.
   President B.D. Carmine of Eli Lilly Japan said that faster development
of the new drug will be possible as the company will obtain information
from Chugai regarding Japanese market trends.
   Nagayama said Chugai has invested specifically in the bone-related field
and he was pleased that Eli Lilly understood this policy of Chugai's and
had decided to cooperate to push the development and marketing of the drug
in Japan.

LIVER CANCER REDUCED THROUGH IFN TREATMENT

   The onset of liver cancer appears to be reduced by more than one third
through interferon (IFN) treatment of hepatitis, said Masao Omata,
professor of Internal Medicine II, Faculty of Medicine, University of
Tokyo.
   He stressed the necessity of treatment aimed at eradication of
hepatocellular carcinoma from the hepatitis treatment stage. Omata said
that at present hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 83% of patients with
hepatitis C and 11% of those with hepatitis B.
   Based on comparative data between patients with hepatitis treated or not
treated with IFN, hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 2,200 patients per
100,000 of the population in the untreated group. But in the treated group,
this figure is reduced to 600 patients. This indicates that IFN treatment
of hepatitis inhibits the onset of the cancer.
   The 5-year survival rate for 500 patients treated for hepatocellular
carcinoma over the past 3 and a half years was 35%.

REOPRO CLINICAL RESULTS ARE TRIAL STOPPERS

   Centocor, Inc. has halted two clinical trials of ReoPro, its
anti-platelet indicated for the reduction of acute cardiac ischemic
complications in patients undergoing angioplasty, because of the strong
positive results of its testing, officials said last month.
   In addition to getting more good news on the drug's effects on patients
undergoing angioplasty procedures in a clinical in mid-December,
researchers found only days later that it showed dramatic benefits in cases
of unstable angina.
   Centocor's stock price, as a direct result of the news, jumped some 75%
in the third week of December and was trading around 30 as BTNW went to
press last week.
   Pharmaceutical industry analysts said the strong clinical trial results
for unstable angina patients could more than double the potential market
for ReoPro by making it a treatment for everyone seeking help for chest
pains, in addition to its use for those receiving angioplasty.

polynucleotide sequence comprising a series of primer hybridization,
extending, and denaturing steps to provide an intermediate double-stranded
DNA molecule containing a promoter sequence (through the use of a
promoter-sequence-containing primer) incorporated upstream from the target
sequence. The double-stranded DNA intermediate is then used to grow
multiple RNA copies of the target sequence. The resulting RNA copies can be
used as target sequences to produce further copies. Multiple cycles of this

specificity. The invention also provides a reagent which does not suffer
any activity drop during supply and preservation thereof and is highly
stable. Thermostable enzymes are used as the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase,
DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ribonuclease
H, all of which are necessary for the replicative RNA-base amplification
system. It is desirable to use combinedly a thermostable DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase and a thermostable enzyme originating in Thermus thermophilus
which comprises all of the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, DNA-dependent DNA
polymerase and ribonuclease H. The use of the thermostable enzymes
according to the above method serves to prevent the enzymes from being
deactivated and enables the amplification without the necessity for
sequentially adding the enzymes.
