<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Why Life Insurance in Your Tax Qualified Plan?</STRONG></FONT><P>


<STRONG>Build Your Savings and Protect Your Family</STRONG><BR>
The most typical retirement plans offer several investment options, including one that,
subject to certain
restrictions, allows employees to purchase life insurance with a  portion of their regular plan
contributions.  Through such a plan, you are able to protect your family should you die, and
build cash
value in your life insurance policy as dividends or interest accumulate over time.  What are
the
advantages of life insurance funded through your retirement plan?  <P>
<STRONG>Affordability</STRONG> - Contributions to your retirement plan are generally
made on a
pre-tax basis. 
So, the life insurance you purchase through a qualified retirement plan costs less than if
purchased
with dollars that have already been taxed.  Buying life insurance through a tax qualified plan
may also
free up dollars that you may now be using to purchase insurance outside of the
plan.<P>

A small portion of the policy premiums paid through the tax
qualified plan are reported as taxable income each year.  When the policy cash values are
subsequently paid out as a taxable distribution, these previously taxed amounts may be
used to reduce this taxable income.

<P>
<STRONG>Convenience</STRONG> - Premiums are automatically paid along with your
regular plan
contributions, so there's no need to worry about writing checks or missing a payment.  And,
if your plan
permits, existing funds may be applied as payment for the life insurance.<P>
<STRONG>Tax Advantages</STRONG> - Once again, the dollars used to pay for the
insurance are
pre-tax.  Also
note that the insurance death benefit (in excess of the policy cash value) is not subject to
income taxes. 
And, if your spouse is your beneficiary, the proceeds are estate tax free.  <P>
<STRONG>Cash Value Accumulation</STRONG> - The policy's cash value accumulates
until
retirement and may
be used to provide additional retirement income or may be taken as a lump sum if the plan
permits. 
<P>
<STRONG>Disability Waiver</STRONG> - Some policies include a disability waiver of
premium option. 
This
guarantees that if you become disabled, and are unable to work, New York Life will
automatically pay
your policy premium until your disability ends.<P>

Please see your policy contract for the specifics
on the Disability Waiver of Premium rider.

<P>
<STRONG>Protection Now and at Retirement</STRONG> - Your overall retirement plan
gives you
peace of mind
that your retirement years will be financially stable.  The insurance portion of your retirement
plan
protects you and your family now and in the future.
<P>


<STRONG>Life Insurance Makes Perfect Cents</STRONG><BR>
The chart below illustrates the power of including life insurance in your employer-sponsored
retirement
plan.  Jim and Fred both contribute $3,600 to their plans.  But, Fred uses part of his
contribution to
purchase a $100,000 life insurance policy.  If both Jim and Fred die on day one of the first
year of their
plan participation, Jim's beneficiary receives $3,600 - his plan contribution.  Fred's
beneficiary
receives $2,303 ($3,600 less the policy premium) plus the face amount of the life insurance
policy for a
total of $102,303.  <P>


<P>
Now what if Jim and Fred die after 15 years?  Jim's beneficiary would receive $76,197,
representing his
contribution to the plan plus interest (hypothetical assumed interest rate:  6%).  Fred's
beneficiary would
receive $172,159.  That's $53,605 in plan accumulations plus $118,554 from the
insurance
policy.  In
the example without life insurance, the entire amount paid to the beneficiary is subject to
income tax. 
However, in the example that includes life insurance, the cash value ($22,592) is taxable
(less the
applicable amount of reported term costs).  The remainder of the proceeds ($95,962) is free
from
income tax.  It's clear that life insurance makes a tremendous difference.
