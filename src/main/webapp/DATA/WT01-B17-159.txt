<b>Showboating Alternative Medicine</b>
<p>

Why is Cloris Leachman wearing only fruits and vegetables and flaunting herself on the cover of our magazine? The answer is she's celebrating a healthy body and what has kept her going strong over a 50-year acting career: a natural approach to eating, healing, and living. Cloris has always been a pioneer. Long before it was popular, she was using alternative medicine to keep herself healthy. Now, at the age of 70, Cloris is reaping the benefits.<p>

Currently starring as the captain's spirited wife, Parthy, in the touring show of the Broadway musical favorite, Showboat, Cloris astonishes the younger cast members who can hardly keep up with her energy. The musical is based on a 1926 novel by Edna Ferber about a late 19th-century family traveling on a riverboat down "old man river." After performances in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Minneapolis, Showboat opens in Los Angeles in mid-November this year. <p>

The role is Cloris' most recent in a lifetime of memorable, high-energy acting. Some fans may remember her as Ruth Martin, the sympathetic mother in the 1950s television series, Lassie. In the 1970s, she was known to many as dotty Phyllis Lindstrom on the Mary Tyler Moore Show; afterwards, Cloris went on to greater recognition in her own spin-off series, Phyllis. <p>

Winner of 6 Emmys, a Golden Globe, an English Academy award, and an Oscar, Cloris has starred in 6 television series and appeared in over 40 feature films, 35 films for television, and 24 theatrical productions from the comedies of Shakespeare to the musicals of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein. Cloris has played everything from a comical dominatrix nurse in Mel Brooks' High Anxiety to a lonely housewife in Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show. <p>

Mary Tyler Moore, Cloris' co-star for 5 years, reports that when Cloris came across a stage direction she thought was wanting in some way, she would cross it out and write in "opportunity." In other words, find your own way. Cloris has long used the same approach for health and healing. When she didn't like the prescription of conventional medicine, she came up with her own, enlisting the help of alternative medicine. However, she dislikes the term "alternative" because, as she puts it, "We're the health people, not them. They're the ones on the wrong side of the track. " <p>

<b>"Just Let the Body Heal Itself"</b><p>

It was at the age of 35 that Cloris took her health into her own hands. She had suffered from boils since her teen years; severe hay fever caused her to take pills all day; and arthritis in her fingers was so painful she couldn't bear to shake hands. When she was diagnosed with asthma on top of everything else, she decided she wasn't going to accept it and set out in search of help. In the early 1960s, the notion of healthy and natural living was barely a rumor in American culture and holistic healers were hard to find. Cloris consulted physicians, therapists, psychiatrists, "everybody—and of course nothing helped." 
What happened next would be described today as finding the doctor within. In a time when few people had heard of such a thing, Cloris went on a water and fresh juice fast, alternating orange, grapefruit, and watermelon on different days. "I didn't know why I was doing it," she reports. "I just knew I couldn't put another thing into my body until whatever was in me came out." Later she learned that food allergies, particularly dairy, were at the root of her health problems.
Her instinct to "just let the body heal itself" allowed her to detoxify. On the first day, her nose was running like a faucet, the area under her tongue swelled up, her ears were draining, and her skin broke into a rash. As she grew up in Iowa, meat, eggs, and dairy products were staples of Cloris' diet. Now, her instincts again told her that she needed to change her diet. During the juice fast, the idea came to her: "I guess I won't be eating meat anymore." <p>

By the fourth day of the fast, all of her symptoms were gone. "That's when I understood that your body cleans out the minute you let it. I was so cleaned out, so pure, so new. I was bursting with life and vitality. It was a huge life-changing experience." Cloris had also been anemic, but she turned that around within 2 weeks by drinking freshly-squeezed carrot juice.<p>

Since then, Cloris has continued to take responsibility for her own health and that of her family. When her son was 7 and came down with tonsillitis, Cloris went into action. "Adam, if you'll cooperate with me, we'll take care of this quickly," she told him. "I gave him freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice all day long. By the first night, Adam's fever was down, and in a couple more days he was fine—with no drugs." <p>

Over the years, Cloris has explored nearly every alternative modality in the field. She's used and benefited from the more familiar practices of acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, chiropractic, and muscle response testing (applied kinesiology). But she has also ventured into progressive health therapies such as chelation, energy medicine through the Electro-Acuscope, and live blood analysis through darkfield microscopy. Chelation improves circulation and pulls heavy metals from the body; the Electro-Acuscope uses a low electrical current to stimulate tissue repair; and darkfield microscopy analyzes the living blood for information about overall health, nutritional deficiencies, and the presence of disease before it manifests in physical symptoms. <p>

<b>Chinese Medicine Saves a Family Member's Life</b><p>

Cloris and her family use alternative medicine regularly. Cloris' daughter-in-law, Pamela Pietri, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine in San Diego, California, used it to save her father's life. He was in the hospital with congestive heart failure complicated by pneumonia. The specialists attending him—one each for his kidneys, heart, and lungs—said his kidneys were failing and he wouldn't last another day. Pamela wanted to give him acupuncture, but the doctors forbid it. The chief resident declared: "No licensed acupuncturist is going to get by me in this hospital." The only option they gave Pamela was to sit and watch her father die.<p>

Pamela rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night and found her father shivering in bed, covered only with a single blanket. Hooked up to an intravenous feed for 10 days and fed only ice cream by the nurses, he was suffering from malnutrition. Pamela also discovered that the lung specialist had given her father a drug that, by the books, could have killed most people with a serious heart condition. 
When no one was looking, Pamela treated her father with the appropriate herbs, such as ginseng to restore his digestive function. She also massaged certain acupressure points to get his kidneys and bladder functioning again. He began to steadily improve and, 3 days later, was able to come home from the hospital.<p>

"Conventional doctors divide your body up," says Cloris. "They don't seem to know that it's all connected." As for the doctors, they took all the credit, she reports. "They told us, 'Well, yes, all the antibiotics finally worked.'"<p>

With the knowledge of 35 years of pursuing healthy alternatives, Cloris is a resource for those around her. Showboat cast members come to her with questions: What do I do for a sore throat? How can I keep from getting cancer? What about my child's tonsils? One of her sourcebooks is Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide.  "If anybody has anything wrong, I look it up," says Cloris. "I'm always looking up things for people in Showboat."<p>

Although she is a fountain of information, Cloris considers health a personal journey and emphasizes that she is not advocating anything. "That makes it all sound so boring and separates me from other people," she says. "When I talk about health, it's not about advocating; it comes out of enthusiasm." In her view, a healthy life is enjoyable and words of denial—such as should, allowed, regimen, diet, practice, control, and discipline—have no place. <p>

Cloris is creative in fostering the healthy rather than forbidding the unhealthy. One day, nearly faint with hunger, she walked into a swank restaurant in Westport, Connecticut. The air was full of cigarette smoke to which Cloris is allergic. She would either have to go without lunch or figure something out. "I'll give anybody a back rub who will stop smoking," she called out. Thirty people put out their cigarettes and queued for a massage. She gave every one of them a back rub and never did get around to eating.<p>

A year later Cloris was waiting for lunch at another posh restaurant, this time in Manhattan. A woman at a nearby table lit a cigarette, but before she inhaled even once, Cloris made her an offer she couldn't refuse. "If you don't smoke, I'll give you a back rub." Turning to a woman at the next table, Cloris recounted the Westport back-rub marathon. The woman said, "I own that restaurant."<p>

<b>Wheat Grass Juice Keeps the Doctor Away</b><p>

For the most part, Cloris eats healthy, vegetarian fare—"food that is closest to the ground or tree as possible"—but she is not rigid about it. She does, however, "enjoy" a glass of wheat grass juice every morning ("I really hate the taste, but it does the trick"). Once a week, she gets a tray of sprouted wheat grains—it looks like a miniature lawn—and liquefies the grass in a special juicer. For those unfamiliar with its virtues, wheat grass juice is often prescribed by acupuncturists and naturopaths as a blood restorative and energy builder. <p>

A half an hour or so before the wheat grass juice, Cloris gets the morning started with a liquid fiber concoction of psyllium seeds, aloe vera, apple juice, and hot water. She follows the wheat grass juice with a high-energy blend called Nature's Blessing Herbal Superfood (containing 55 natural ingredients), to which she adds spirulina, vitamin C powder, freshly-ground raw sunflower seeds, and blueberries or peaches. Then she may have fresh fruit as well. <p>

"That's generally my morning routine," says Cloris, "It keeps me going. I do fruit in the morning, vegetables at night but don't mix them because they require different digestive enzymes."<p>

Throughout the day, Cloris does what she calls "body checks." She tunes in for a moment to see how her body is feeling and what it needs. Do I need to get up and stretch? Would I like some water? Do I need something to eat? Would I like to uncross my legs? "If you do this, you won't need a cigarette, a pill, or a drink at the end of the day," says Cloris.<p>

In addition to choosing healthy foods and being aware of what is happening in her body, a major part of Cloris' health success has been her decision to not be sick. On occasion, she'll exert this power of intention on other people's behalf, healing migraines with a back and neck rub to get the blood flowing. "I can often stop a migraine in 1 to 5 minutes," she says.<p>

Cloris' former husband, producer George Englund, performed a similar service for her when she broke a leg and came down with the flu after the death of her mother. "I got so low I thought I could just slip away easily," recalls Cloris. "My husband came home in the middle of the day with an armload of flowers. He got me out of bed, fever and all, and said, 'We're going out for dinner.' That was the beginning of my way back up." <p>

<b>The Medical System Is All about Money and Power</b><p>

Cloris may view health as a personal journey, but she can wax a little wroth at the abuses and political power structures of the U.S. medical system. More than a talker, Cloris backs up her beliefs with action. In 1994, when Congress was deliberating on giving the FDA control over vitamins and herbal supplements, Cloris was involved in the campaign aimed at defeating the bill, which would have been disastrous for alternative medicine. <p>

"I have a huge rage at this," she declares. "It's all about money and power. Physicians have been 'indoctorinated' by the American Medical Association and the big pharmaceutical companies. I've been to doctors' offices where they'll reach in a drawer and give you samples of anything you want. Half the time they don't even know what they're for."<p>

"If you embrace health, you don't need all those drugs and you don't have to be subjected to the usual list of 'old-age' health problems," says Cloris. If she has any health advice to dispense, it is this: don't eat red meat, try to avoid operations, and go to your local health food store and start educating yourself. Above all, "Don't have anything to do with anything that doesn't invite your soul."
To all appearances, this natural healing pioneer will be dancing circles around her fellow cast members and swinging from trees for many years to come. <p>
