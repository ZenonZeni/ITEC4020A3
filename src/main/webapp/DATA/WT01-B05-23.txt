<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: June 3 & 13, 1995<br> 
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: The Race Results</H3> 


Rank is position within the CATEGORY, based on Miles.
Overall is overall standing, across all CATEGORIES, based on Miles.
Number is the vehicle number.
Miles is called Pole Miles on the sheet this is taken from, and (I believe)
Tour Miles on earlier sheets.  It is the adjusted overall score, summing up
starting banner-to-finishing banner distance, plus extra laps, plus extra
credit items, minus penalties.
Award is the cash component of the NESEA prize.  It also includes display
space at and pre-paid registrations to the Sustainable Transportation/Solar
and Electric Vehicle conference this fall in Providence RI.<p>

Rob Wills pointed out that one would expect the ZAP Powered Rotator to win
the 2 wheel category, especially given they were not measuring the energy that
Myhee, the cyclist, was consuming as food.  But, ZAP only got 242.7 m/g
because their charger was far less efficient than the one used by ERANGE.
Rob also pointed out that the heavier hybrids did not do as well as one might
expect.
                        Tempest                  11.2
                        Project e-                9.5<P>

(I expect that Tempest's extra complexity cost them a lot, and the fact that
Project e- did not remove any of their lead-acid batteries when they added the
propane tank, engine and generator, and also charged from the grid may have
given them to worst of both worlds.)<P>

East Penn Manufacturing Co, Lyons Station PA, presented awards to entries that
used their Deka line of batteries.<P>

        4th     Helios the Heron         $250
        3rd     Fulmine                  $500
        2nd     Hopper EV               $1000
        1st     Sunpacer                $2000<P>

<B>Best, Most Autonomous, Practical Car, NESEA award:</B><P>

                        Sol Survivor III</pre><P>

(This car had large solar panels, and to supplement their battery charge
during the race.  It raced in the 2-passenger COMMUTER category against
cars that had to plug in.)  Nancy Hazard, director of the ATdS, said she would
like to create a new category for "practical, solar-electric, 2-seater,
autonomous car" to compete with Sol Survivor III.
<UL>
<LI>Sol Survivor III was recognized as having the most outrageous paint job.
(Hot pink and electric blue.)
<LI>Sofix Design was acknowledged as the car with the most batteries and the most electrical connections to trouble-shoot.  (180 nickel-zinc batteries.)
<LI>The Old Timer Award to the only car that has been in every ATdS:  Suntech
The Most Inches Of Ink (press coverage):  Electric Hare from Falmouth, ME.
<LI>The Tough Luck Award:  Wild Cherry. This scooter came from Austin TX, and had problems that ended with a burned out motor that they were unable to replace.
<LI>The Best T-Shirt and Strangest Arrest Award:  Mach .05.
A Maine citizen tried to make a citizen's arrest of Mach .05 for being
"illegal in the state of Maine" for driving too slowly.
<LI>The Bullwinkle Award for the Recognition of the Largest Non-Human Life Form Encountered During the American Tour de Sol:  Fulmine. Angelo Esposito, from Staten Island NY, saw a full-sized moose during the race.
(Welcome to Northern Exposure, Southeast)
<LI>Rob Wills commented that it is sometimes too easy to see Solectria as a
corporation and separate from the student racing community.  But he reminded
the audience that it was born in a hole-in-the-wall lab at MIT, and he hoped
that, especially the younger people such as the Helios team, would remember
that fact.  Someday some of them would form their own car companies, or work for a car company, "and help make beautiful cars."

Personal comments:<br><P>

        The Sunrise, a static model just 6 months ago, showed itself to be a
very real contender and I think points the way to at least a portion of the
future.  I suspect I will someday tell folks about when I first saw the 
Sunrise-a very real contender and a vehicle that I think points the way to at least a portion of the
future.<P>

        2 high school projects, Project e-, a hybrid, and Solar Bolt,
a lead-acid battery car, are in overall positions 4 and 5, ahead of some of
the PRODUCTION cars.  The Tempest, a college hybrid, also placed up amidst
the PRODUCTION entries.<P>

        Personal projects, such as Genesis I and Millenium Falcon did very well
overall.<P>

        And Helios the Heron may have come in (almost) dead-last, but
the kids were wonderful and I would not be surprised to see some of them go on
to do really marvelous things in the future.<P>

So that's it.  I hope you folks have found this as interesting as I did.
The American Tour de Sol is a place where you can see Electric Vehicles in
a wide variety of forms, on the hoof, dealing with the real world pretty
much as we find it.<P>

        Next year's race is scheduled to go from New York City to Washington
DC; contact NESEA for details.<P>

I extend my thanks all those who generously gave of their time and thoughts for
these interviews, NESEA for their support in this project, and Bill Lord for
cross-posting all this stuff to the World Wide Web.
