<p> The people of the County of Santa Cruz do ordain as follows: </p>

<h2>SECTION 1. TITLE: </h2>

<p> The title of this ordinance shall be: The Santa Cruz County
Medical Marijuana Ordinance. </p>

<h2>SECTION 2. PURPOSE: </h2>

<p> The purposes of this ordinance are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>To express the compassion of the people of Santa Cruz
        County for the medically challenged in our community
        whose sufferings would be alleviated by the use of
        medical marijuana. <br>
    </li>
    <li>To express the strong support of the people of Santa Cruz
        County for the restoration of Cannabis / Marijuana
        medical preparations to the list of available medicines
        which can be prescribed by licensed physicians. <br>
    </li>
    <li>To direct the elected officials of Santa Cruz County to
        take whatever actions may be within their power to
        support the availability of Cannabis / Marijuana for
        medical use. </li>
</ol>

<h2>SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS: </h2>

<p> For the purposes of this ordinance, Cannabis / Marijuana
medical preparations shall mean: all products made from cannabis
or marijuana, in any form intended or used for human consumption,
for the treatment of any disease; the relief of pain; or as an
adjunct to any medical procedure for the treatment of Cancer,
Glaucoma, or AIDS; or for any other medical or healing purpose
defined within the bounds of the doctor/patient relationship. </p>

<h2>SECTION 4. FINDINGS: </h2>

<p> The people of the County of Santa Cruz make the following
findings: </p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Safe And Effective Medicine. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">Scientific and medical studies by the
        National Academy of Science have shown Cannabis /
        Marijuana to be a safe and effective medicine with very
        low toxicity compared to most prescription drugs. It has
        been shown to be effective in the treatment of glaucoma;
        epilepsy; muscle spasticity; arthritis; the nausea,
        vomiting and appetite loss associated with
        chemotherapies; anxiety and depression; and the symptoms
        of withdrawal from alcohol and narcotics. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">Doctors And Patients Need The Cannabis /
        Marijuana Option. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">Studies show that one-third of all
        cancer patients discontinue potentially life-saving
        chemotherapy due to the severe and debilitating side
        effects. The same is true for many AIDS patients
        receiving AZT or other similar therapies. Most physicians
        surveyed said that they would prescribe Cannabis /
        Marijuana if legally available. Half of all cancer
        specialists surveyed said that they have already
        encouraged at least one of their patients to break the
        law and use Cannabis / Marijuana to ease the violent
        nausea and vomiting associated with their current
        treatments. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">United Nations Approves Prescription
        Marijuana. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">In May of 1991, the United Nations
        Narcotic Control Board voted overwhelmingly to reclassify
        Cannabis / Marijuana, placing it back on Schedule 2, and
        making it available by prescription. The United States
        Representative to this board voted in favor of
        rescheduling. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">Federal Court Orders Prescription
        Marijuana. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">Despite a Federal Court Order
        recognizing the &quot;clearly established medical
        value&quot; of Cannabis / Marijuana, and mandating that
        it be reclassified to Schedule 2 and available by
        prescription, the federal government continues to deny
        access to this safe and effective medicine. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">Politics Before Patients. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">By its own admission, the federal
        government continues to deny access to Cannabis /
        Marijuana for political rather than medical reasons.
        Using patients as pawns in the ever-escalating War on
        Drugs, current policies place message before medicine,
        convenience before compassion, and politics before
        patients.<br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4"></font></b> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">SECTION 5. IMPLEMENTATION. </font></b> </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li><font size="4">Within 90 (ninety) days of the
        certification of the November 3, 1992 General Election,
        the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors shall transmit
        the text of this ordinance to the President of the United
        States, the Governor of the State of California, and the
        Federal and State Legislative Rep- representatives of
        Santa Cruz County and urge them to take whatever actions
        that may be in their power to: <br>
        </font> <ol>
            <li><font size="4">Restore Cannabis / Marijuana
                medical preparations to the list of available

                physicians. <br>
                </font> </li>
            <li><font size="4">Provide for by law and institute
                such mechanisms as may be necessary to insure a

        of this ordinance in setting their priorities and to

<h2>Impartial Analysis By County Counsel Santa Cruz County
Measure A <br>
Marijuana For Medical Use Initiative <br>
</h2>

<h3>If approved by a majority of those voting on this measure, it
will become a County ordinance. The measure appears on the ballot
as a result of initiative petitions which gathered more than the
number of signatures required by state law for placement on the
ballot. <br>
If enacted, the measure will not change existing laws on the
availability of marijuana for medical purposes, or on the
illegality of marijuana possession. Rather, the measure would
constitute a policy statement favoring the increased availability
of marijuana for medical purposes. <br>
If enacted, the measure would require the Santa Cruz County Board
of Supervisors to take certain actions to communicate the policy
to State and Federal elected officials. The Board of Supervisors
would also be required to request the Sheriff and District
Attorney of Santa Cruz County to adhere to the spirit of the
ordinance in setting their priorities, and to minimize the
negative impacts of legal restrictions on marijuana for medical
use to the extent they have discretion to do so. Because no
change in the criminal law on this subject results from its
enactment, however, the second directive to the Sheriff and
District Attorney is of uncertain effect. <br>
The Board of Supervisors would also be required to direct the
County Health Services Agency to monitor research developments
and make information avail- able concerning medical use of
marijuana. Such activities by the Health Services Agency would be
a County cost in an undetermined amount. <br>
A &quot;yes&quot; vote authorizes enactment of the measure into
the Santa Cruz County Code and approves making the Findings set
out in the measure. A &quot;no&quot; vote rejects enactment of
the measure as a part of the Santa Cruz County Code. <br>

<h2>ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A <br>
</h2>

<h3>&quot;My commitment as a physician is to ease suffering and
to do no harm. Both are often possible with cannabis medicines.
The government's policy of denying patients this treatment is
indefensible. It's a matter of compassion and common sense. Vote
yes on Measure A.&quot;<br>
-Arnold Leff, MD- <br>
The emotional and financial impacts of catastrophic illness can
be devastating. For the thousands of seriously ill and disabled
Americans who have a medical necessity for cannabis/marijuana,
the devastation is compounded by a government that ignores the
best medical evidence and condemns them to a criminal black
market in their daily struggle for wellness. <br>
Measure A calls on the federal government to allow licensed
physicians to prescribe marijuana for patients with life and
sense threatening illnesses. <br>
The Controlled Substances Act allows for cannabis to be restored
to the list of available medicines if &quot;a significant
minority of physicians have accepted it as safe under medical
supervision.&quot; <br>
In 1988, after the most extensive review of the record ever
undertaken, US Administrative Law Judge Francis Young stated that
&quot;marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man. By any rational
analysis cannabis can be used safely under a supervised routine
of medical care.&quot; <br>
Dr. Leff and Judge Young are not alone. Seventy percent of cancer
specialists, 35 state legislatures (including California), the
United Nations Narcotics Control Board, the California Medical
Association, and 80% of San Francisco voters agree - cannabis
should be available to the seriously ill and disabled to ease
their pain and suffering. <br>
Measure A will ease suffering and do no harm. Simply stated,
Measure A is good medicine. Vote Yes for Compassion. Vote Yes for
Common Sense. Vote Yes on Measure A. <br>
