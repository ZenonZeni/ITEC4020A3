WEATHER CUTS FORTIES CRUDE OUTPUT TO 550-600,000B/D

(London)
Production of UK Forties Blend crude plummeted to 550-600,000 b/d December
29 as freezing weather conditions caused problems at onshore processing
facilities in Scotland, a source with an equity producer said.
   The source said output was likely to remain at that level for the next
couple of days. Operator BP admitted that production from the fields which
make up the Forties system had now fallen below 800,000 b/d because of the
problems at onshore processing facilities at Kinneil.
   "It's down, it's quite low. We're working on it right now," a BP
spokesman said. "It was 800,000 b/d a while ago (today) and has gone below
800,000 b/d," he said.
   The spokesman was unable to predict when Forties output would return to
normal levels of 1-1.2-mil b/d. "We don't know with the weather being as it
is," he said.
   The equity producer source said Forties production was around 1-mil b/d
in early December and fell to 800,000 b/d "a few days ago" before falling
further December 29.
   Trading sources close to operator BP said a total of 2-mil bbl or the
equivalent of four Forties cargoes had so far been cancelled from the
January loading schedule. "A string of old problems" is expected to push
the current loading schedule back for at least one to two days, one source
said.
   Recent Forties spot trades achieved directionally stronger price
differentials to dated Brent. Mid-January transactions of the grade were
reported late December 28 at around dated Brent plus 20-23 cts or around
$19.01-19.04/bbl.

LIBYA RAISES JANUARY CRUDE PRICES BY 5-20 CTS/BBL

By:
Gerald Bueshel, London.

(London)
   Libya has raised its official selling price for crude liftings in
January by 5-20 cts/bbl, equity sources said Friday.
   The price for Es Sider, the main Libyan export grade, was set at dated
Brent plus 15 cts/bbl, compared to dated Brent minus 5 cts/bbl in
December.
   January OSPs for other grades were announced as follows: Sirtica at
dated Brent plus 18 cts/bbl (up 18 cts from December); Brega and Zueitina
at dated Brent plus 30 cts (up 5 cts); Sarir at dated Brent minus 55 cts
(up 5 cts); Amna at dated Brent minus 60 cts (up 5 cts); Bu Attifel at
dated Brent minus 40 cts (up 5 cts); and Bouri at Iranian Heavy FOB Sidi
Kerir minus 25 cts/bbl (up 5 cts).

MORE TIME ALLOWED FOR BP REFINERY SALE TO TOSCO

(New York)
   BP has pushed back into January the possible shutdown of the Marcus
Hook, Pennsylvania refinery, allowing more time for the union there to
reach a new contract with Tosco, which is buying BP's US Northeast refining
and marketing assets.
   BP had said it would begin to suspend operations at the 190,000 b/d
Marcus Hook plant at the start of January if it was unable to close the
deal with Tosco by the end of 1995. And BP had wanted Tosco to have a new
contract in place with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union at the
refinery before closing its deal with Tosco.
   BP now has delayed the potential shutdown until the middle of January, a
company spokesman said December 29. However, a union official said BP has
indicated in talks with OCAW that it would push back the suspension until
the end of the month. The BP spokeswoman had no comment on the union
official's statement.
   BP's current contract with the OCAW expires January 31.
   BP has extended the shutdown deadline to allow more time for the
company, as well as Tosco, to negotiate with the OCAW, the BP spokeswoman
said. BP still must settle severance issues with the union, while Tosco
must negotiate a new contract.
   The spokeswoman said severe winter weather in the Philadelphia area has
delayed its negotiations with the union. She also said BP is encouraged by
the meetings that began last week between Tosco and the OCAW. A bargaining
session between the two was held December 29. Tosco had indicated a desire
to cut refinery staff by 25% and reduce refinery runs by 20%.
   The BP spokeswoman said the company still wants to close the Tosco sale
as soon as possible. Should the company suspend operations at Marcus Hook
in January, it's likely that the sale to Tosco would close in February, she
said.

ACTIVE VLCC TANKER MARKETS

(London)
   South Korean charterers were busy in the VLCC market, with a rash of
fixtures reported Arab Gulf-South Korea, mainly around Worldscale 57-59 for
250-260,000mt lots.
   Despite the Christmas holiday, European charterers were relatively
active, with Mediterranean refiners in particular keen to fix stems out of
the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir through the first half of the month.
Brokers suggested that owners were for now willing to settle for around
Worldscale 90 on Suezmax ships, but that charterers feared an increase in
rates once the rest of the market returned to work after the New Year
holiday.
   West African business was similarly fairly brisk, with rates creeping
slightly higher, even after factoring in the increase in flat rates for
1996. Late in the week, several fixtures were seen for West
Africa-UKContinent and the Med, while a steady stream of vessels continued
to head West Africa-US Gulf Coast and US Atlantic Coast at rates around
Worldscale 89-90 for 130,000mt.

JAPAN TO HIKE CRUDE OIL RESERVE TO 305-MIL BBL IN FISCAL YEAR 1996

(Tokyo)
   Japan will raise its national strategic crude stockpile by 1.2- bil
liter (7.5-mil bbl) to 48.71-bil liter (304.6-mil bbl) in the next fiscal
year starting April, a source at Agency of Natural Resources and Energy
said Wednesday.
   Ministry of Finance halved the agency's original request for 2.5-bil
liter (15.6-mil bbl) in order to allocate financial resources for
construction of a national strategic LPG stockpile, industry sources said.
   The country's first government-operated LPG reserve complex, with a
capacity of 250,000mt, will be built in Nanao in central Japan's Ishikawa
prefecture next year.
   The national strategic crude stockpile is expected to reach the
government's self-imposed goal of 50-bil liters (312.7-mil bbl) in the
fiscal year 1997-1998, the agency source added.

ASIA: 1995 GOES OUT QUIETLY

   Gasoline cargo prices in Singapore were steady in very quiet trade ahead
of the New Year holiday. The 97 RON unleaded market was supported at $21.50
while 95 RON was flat at $20.95. In the 92 RON market, prices were flat at
$19.75-19.85. Swaps were also unchanged for January and February at
$20.70-21.20.
   The open-spec naphtha market was softer due to the downturn on crude
prices and news that the CDU at the SRC refinery would re-starting on
Sunday. Trade was thin as the market slowed for the holiday break. Second
half February was bid at $175.00 while first half March quoted at
$174.00-175.00. The front half to back half February spread was in
backwardation at $1.75. Singapore paper was weaker with January talked at
$17.50-17.60, February at $17.40-17.50.
   The kerosene market dropped slightly with some selling interest now
apparent in Singapore. A major offered 100,000 bbl, FOB Singapore, for
loading January 23-28 at $32.25. A trader bought the parcel at even with
the market mean, pricing on current day quotes. Another major and a trader
bid for 200,000-250,000 bbl parcels for loading January 14-24 at $32.50.
Reports surfaced that a major was shipping kerosene to Asia from Western
Europe and some talked of shipments from the Caribbean. A major bid for DPK
on a C+F basis into Japan at $34.40-35.20 for delivery January 25-29.
However, there was only interest if the product was shipped directly from a
refinery and not from storage.
   The gasoil paper market tumbled in early Singapore trade with January
done at $26.30, markedly lower that the previous day's close at $25.90. The
drop was attributed to weaker IPE and NYMEX settlements on Thursday and the
closing of positions ahead of the New Year. January paper dropped to as
low as $24.95 before it recovered to around $25.15, a reflection of IPE
strength at the opening. Physical bids were also lower in Singapore as
buyers stepped down almost in line with the weaker paper. A trader bid for
180,000 bbl for loading January 13-17 at $25.75, then at $25.85. A seller
offered 150,000 bbl at $26.00 for loading January 20-24 but no deal was
done. Earlier in the day, a 100,000 bbl parcel traded at 50 cts over the
market mean.
   Despite bearish sentiment in the swaps market, cargo residual fuel oil
prices were stable due to the rebound in crude values. A trader offered
20,000mt of 180 CST at $116.50, then at $117.50, for January 13-17.
   A major bid for that date range at $116.25, then at $117.25. The same
company was also willing to pay $117.00 for January 18-22. A bid for
January 24-28 was seen at $115.75. Later, a 20,000mt trade went on the
books for January 18-22 at $117.00. The 180/380 CST spread was pegged at
$6.50/mt due to tight cutter stock avails. January swaps were done at
$115.00, $114.75, $114.00, $113.00 and $113.50 and February at $108.50 and
$107.40.
   Indonesia is expected to allocate an additional 400,000 bbl of LSWR for
January to its affiliates. Indonesia had allocated 4.15-mil bbl. A
Indonesian affiliate fixed 200,000 bbl of mixed/cracked for second half
January lifting at the Pertamina formula, plus around $1.20, FOB
Indonesia.

EUROPE: QUIET CLOSE

   A couple of first half January premium unleaded barges changed hands at
slightly lower prices, $167.00 and $167.50 for storage material, FOB
Amsterdam/Rotterdam, and $166 for very prompt loading. A regular unleaded
barge sale was reported at $157 for 1,000mt, FOB Rotterdam. Cargo activity,
however, was dead, and the only other business reported was some January
swap action at $169.50-170.00, FOB Rotterdam.
   A flurry of naphtha cargoes was placed ahead of the New Year break as
most dealers headed off early for the weekend. An Egyptian cargo for early
January loading was reported sold into Brazil and another sale was heard
into Canada. A January 10-20 arrival for the Mediterranean was confirmed at
$165.50, CIF Spain, for 70 min paraffins. Swaps values were more difficult
to establish. January and February swap levels were notional at $166-168,
CIF NWE.
   A firm tone was maintained though activity was quiet on the jet fuel
market. Sources expected the firm numbers currently obtainable to attract
avails into the market next week. Buying interest into the UK was still
apparent, but much of traders' attention still focused on moving product
into eastern arbitrage opportunities.
   A Russian gasoil cargo was reported sold into Cyprus at $9 over the high
CIF market quotes. Trade was said very quiet over the day with barges
asking a slightly firmer $1 over the gasoil futures screen. GOM was
reported sold FOB at even with the high CIF market quotes. There was also
talk in the market of an Algerian offered in the Mediterranean at $1.25
over formula with bids at 50 cts over. The North may be moving more into
line with the firm numbers in the Mediterranean, traders said. Delays
reported in the Black Sea may be resolved before the New Year, said
sources, and vessels awaiting loading berths were due to dock at the
weekend.
   High sulfur cracked fuel oil in the Mediterranean was again stronger
with a deal heard into Romania at $114, CIF Constanza. FOB bbl were also
well bid, according to brokers. Low sulfur material was harder to gauge. In
NWE, netback values to the US suggested a much firmer market, but trade was
reported into Italy at $123.25, CIF. Refiner, as well as utility, demand
was reported into Italy. High sulfur barge activity was very thin with
prompt trade heard at $105.50, FOB ARA. Low sulfur barges continued to
benefit from the very cold weather in Europe. An E-4 cargo was said to have
been done at $118, basis Rotterdam.

MTBE: QUIET AND STABLE

   Prices were stable in very quiet trade. Material for very early January
were perceived as tight. A refiner reportedly offered 50,000 bbl for
January 10-15 at 92.75 cts, FOB US Gulf. A producer indicated selling
interest for second half January at 93 cts, FOB US Gulf.
   In the Northeast, buying interest was again reported at close to 100 cts
in New York Harbor.

GAS LIQUIDS: PROPANE STILL CLIMBING

   December non-TET propane was done at 38.50 cts at Mt Belvieu in the
morning. But trade thinned with many players leaving early for the New Year
holiday.
   A trader bought normal butane at 38.50 cts for December. January normal
butane sold at 39.50 cts.
   Activity at Conway was extremely quiet. December Warren bbl of natural
gasoline sold at 41.75 cts and 42.00 cts.

ATLANTIC COAST: READY FOR HOLIDAYS

   Unleaded gasoline markets were thinly traded. Sources said that many
traders were "out of the saddle" getting ready to "pop the corks" and
celebrate the New Year.
   Prompt RFG regular unleaded 87 barge offers held at 150 points under the
January screen while bids languished at 200 points under. Softer front half
January RFG Boston unleaded cargo talk was heard at 125-160 points under
the January print.
   Oxygenated RFG regular unleaded 87 barge talk weakened to even to 50
points over the January screen. Softer RFG premium unleaded 93 values were
seen at 3.50-3.75 cts over the January print. Oxygenated RFG premium
unleaded 93 talked at 6.25-6.50 cts over January futures.
   Talk for conventional regular unleaded 87 barges slipped to 5.75-6.25
cts under the January print. Conventional premium unleaded 93 barge values
were seen at 1.75-2.00 cts under the January screen.
   Differentials to the futures screen for No.2 heating oil slipped on the
back of sharply lower NYMEX prices. Prompt No.2 oil barge offers were seen
at 25 points under the January screen, bids were 50 points under. Front
half January Boston No.2 cargo values were pegged at 20-40 points over the
January screen.
   Low sulfur No.2 oil talked at parity with regular No.2 oil. Slightly
softer 54 grade jet fuel talk was heard at 1.20-1.40 cts over the No.2
print. Low sulfur jet/kero, 55 grade, values held at 4.50-4.75 cts over the
No.2 screen.
   Residual fuel oil traders ended 1995 on a quiet note. Most weren't
especially eager to buy or sell and potential selling interest was mostly
limited to a few looking to move foreign low sulfur cargoes.
   Little discussion was heard for 0.3%S H/P and L/P as traders waited for
a New York utility to award its H/P tender for January 10-20 on January 4.
Sellers of 0.3%S L/P barges could still be found at $23.00-23.25.
   Nothing new was seen on the physical 1.0%S market. The "best bid" seen
was at $21.50. Values for January 1.0%S paper were little changed with
sales reported at $20.20, $20.25 and possibly at $20.35.
   Late Thursday, a trader sold its South American 1.7%S cargo at a
market-related high plus 50 cts, delivered to a New England utility. Values
for high sulfur material held near $18.00. New York 380 CST bunker sales
were last heard at $130.

US GULF COAST: A MODEST YEAR-END UPTURN

   Unleaded gasoline prices firmed on the pipeline as a major stepped in to
pick up a few bbl. At one point the market was pushed to 710 points below
the February gasoline futures print. By the end of the day, most called the
first cycle 730 points off.
   Premium unleaded looked a bit stronger at 3.0 cts over regular unleaded
and 93 octane material was another 1.0 cts over that.
   No.2 heating oil was still tight on the water. A 90,000mt ship was taken
to export for the Far East and most put the waterborne market about a 50-75
points over the pipeline. On the pipeline, high sulfur No.2 oil traded as
low as 420 points under the February futures print, slightly less than
Thursday's levels.
   Low sulfur diesel was 15-25 points lower than high sulfur. Jet fuel on
the prompt cycle was 225 points below the February print, while low sulfur
jet fuel sat at 150 points over. Both of those differentials were unchanged
from Thursday.
   Residual fuel oil values were up on the bunker market with $105 reported
for 380 CST at Houston. Most attributed the strength to "distress buying"
for the holiday.
   There was little bulk market activity, but the consensus was that while
more product was available, good export demand remained. Talk on 1.0%S was
higher as well due to the possibility of Florida buying above its contract
requirements.
   Naphtha was quiet around 1.0 cts under unleaded prices.

CHICAGO: PRICE DIFFERENTIALS UNCHANGED

   Differentials to the futures screen were about unchanged with No.2 oil
at 5.25 cts under the print and low sulfur diesel was 3.5 cts below.
   Unleaded gasoline was stable at 4.5 cts under the February futures
print. Premium unleaded was quoted at a 3.5 cts regrade. RBOB was reported
done at a 1.5 cts premium to conventional unleaded.

GROUP THREE: DEMAND CONTINUES

   Differentials to the futures screen for gasoline were unchanged at about
4.50 cts under the February print. Premium unleaded held on to its
3.25-3.50 spread over regular unleaded.
   No.2 heating oil was quiet at 6.0 cts below the February futures print
and low sulfur No.2 oil was 3.0 cts under.
   Al prices were quoted in relation to the February futures for January
delivery.

FUTURES: THIN AND VOLATILE

   The session on NYMEX was dominated by expiration-related activity on the
products, traders said, and resulted in a sharp sell-off in January heating
oil and a milder decline in January unleaded.
   February crude rallied to a new contract high near the close. Some
traders left early, or failed to appear to trade, before the long holiday
weekend and that left trading thin and volatile. Additionally, the IPE
closed at 1300 GMT and that tended to erase some direction from the
market.
   January heating oil, which from early December until Thursday had led
the NYMEX energy complex higher, dropped for the second consecutive
session. Traders tied the decline to expiration-related long liquidation,
profit taking and hedge unwinding. "It's the last day of the last month for
that contract and hedgers and speculators who were long during the recent
price run-up got out," a trader said. The contract also came under pressure
over the past two days due to expectations of moderating temperatures.
   January heating oil began its recent rise at the beginning of December
around 52.00 cts and peaked at the contract high of 62.45 cts on Thursday.
However, profit-taking prior to expiration caused it to drop more than 4
cts in two days. January heating oil closed down 169 points at 58.63 cts.
   January unleaded, which also expired, was under pressure much of the
session on expiration-related activity. Thought the contract recovered from
its lows, the market was too illiquid to really discern much about
direction. January unleaded closed off 42 points at 58.86 cts.
   February crude was range-bound after gaining early on an unexpectedly
low US crude stock figure as reported by API. While crude received some
support from its stock draw, the draws in heating oil and unleaded failed
to support those contracts. "The market tends to ignore the figures
following the initial reaction," a trader said.
   However, in the final minutes of trading the February crude contract
found renewed strength as the market stabilized and it broke above
resistance at the previous contract high of $19.55 to set a new high at
$19.57.

US WEST COAST: PRICES SLIP INTO '96

   The end of 1995 approached quietly in Los Angeles with little talk heard
for most products. Los Angeles unleaded languished at the previous day's
level of 57.00-58.00 cts with few buyers seen. Talk was mostly notional
with some narrower ranges heard.
   Traders said it appeared the Portland unleaded market was starting to
slide a little faster. The range dipped to 54.25-55.25 cts as the market
continued to "figure things out" following the reopening of the pipeline
from Seattle.
   Bay unleaded was said to be losing ground to Los Angeles and talked at
least 1.50 cts lower than Los Angeles. Oxy was reported done at 2.50 cts
over Bay unleaded. Reformulated talk was no higher than 2.00 cts over Los
Angeles conventional unleaded.
   Jet fuel prices in Los Angeles appeared closer to the 66.25 cts level at
which the last reported deal was done. Apparently little was getting done,
but there continued to be enough outside pressure in the form of refinery
problems and Asian prices to keep jet supported.
   A CARB seller in Los Angeles was reportedly looking for 67.00 cts early
while the Bay was pegged around 62.50 cts. Low sulfur No. 2 oil held steady
through the day at 60.00-61.25 cts with 60.00 cts reported done in Los
Angeles for the back half of the month. Portland L/S No.2 oil talked lower
at 57.75-58.75 cts.
   Demand into the fuel oil market screeched to a halt on the last trading
day of the year. Traders scrambled to supply what was left of the demand in
the bunker market.
   In Los Angeles, sources reported that bunker-C sold at $111.50,
resulting in a slight increase in the price of 380 CST and 180 CST.

US CRUDE: TALK OF SUPPLY PROBLEMS

   The steady march to stronger prices in Gulf Coast grades continued on
Friday. The tight avails of crude in the US Gulf has been pushing prices
higher as refiners seek out alternate, cheaper crudes.
   According to one trader, the Brent replacement cost on Thursday was
February WTI plus 42 cts and that contributed to the gains seen in LLS.
That sweet grade climbed several cents above Thursday's levels which were
stronger than Wednesday's levels. February LLS was heard traded at 68, 69
and 70 cts over Cushing WTI, with 70 cts over Cushing WTI said to have been
done 10 to 12 times. That topped Thursday's high of 65 cts.
   February Midland WTI was done at 8-10 cts under Cushing WTI, actually
priced into the Gulf and not into Cushing. The February WTS talk level
firmed. One trader suggested, that with the climb in LLS prices, refiners
might turn to WTS because of the wide differential, as much as $1.00-1.65.
"They would run as much as possible until they 'max out' and their
desulfurization units halt," he said.
   Production problems which cut four January Forties cargoes, cold weather
effects on refineries overseas and production problems in certain fields
created a supply problem in crude worldwide, traders noted. The bottom
line, another said, is "crude is tight, crude is strong."
   There were numerous and persistent reports of activity in South American
crude, but, due to an absence of traders prior to the long weekend, the
reports remained unconfirmed. In addition, a trader said that information
appeared to be flowing less freely than it had in the past.
   A second half February Cano Limon said on offer at WTI minus $1.20 and,
while buyer and seller were confirmed, the selling price could not be
verified. There was talk that an end-January or February Vasconia had
traded, but details weren't available. Several traders doubted reports that
up to four cargoes of Oriente had traded around the ANS minus 40 cts level.
The doubt was due to uncertainty about whether Petroecuador will change its
pricing formula in February.
   No West Coast ANS sales were reported by the main spot seller.

INTERNATIONAL CRUDE: UNEVENTFUL

   The 15-day Brent market was uneventful with two February Brent cargoes
done at $18.53 and a partial done at $18.51. February Brent/Dubai talked at
$1.20-1.25 while February/March Dubai talked at plus 24-30 cts and
March/April Dubai talked at plus 21-25 cts. January 2-5 Brent CFDs were
pegged at February plus 35-40 cts. January 8-12 Brent CFDs were valued
around February plus 15 cts.
   Prompt physical Brent values moved lower versus February when a January
4-6 cargo changed hands early at February plus 30 cts. But two late-day
trades tightened the market. A January 15-17 was done at 5 cts under
January, equivalent to February plus 67 cts. It was later re-sold at
February plus 60 cts. Talk was tighter during the day so the late deal
coincided somewhat with the market. However, next week's CFDs were rumored
done at plus 37 cts. Based on the three trades, the market was valued at
February plus 52 cts.
   In other dated Brent talk, most were waiting for fresh second decade
January offers while seven sets of Brent dates were kept from the chains.
Six of the dates were kept by a UK major said to hold up to 13 physical
Brent cargoes. Little action took place in other North Sea markets with
Oseberg price differentials to dated widening. An end-January cargo of the
grade was heard done at dated plus 37 cts.
   West African markets were fairly quiet with many still absent due to the
holiday season. The general tone for BQ and Forcados price differentials to
dated was said "reasonably strong." Recent trades were seen breaking the
dated plus 50 ct mark. Offers for light Nigerian grades, loading towards
end-January, were said at the mid 50s over dated Friday.
   Mediterranean Urals trade was thin though prices firmed on back of tight
avails with one deal done at dated plus 15 cts, C+F Augusta, for 80,000mt.
Although the port of Novorossiisk re-opened late Thursday, 19 vessels were 
reportedly waiting to load. Sources said Mediterranean refiners were
seeking alternative crude supplies and were replacing their sour crude
requirements with sweet North Sea barrels.
