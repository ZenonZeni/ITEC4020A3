<P>General Driving Tips:

<LI>Observe posted speed limits.  The average car uses 17 percent less gasoline at 55 mph than at 65 mph.  If highway speed limits were observed across the country, approximately 4 million gallons of gasoline would be saved each day.
<LI>Avoid stop-and-go traffic.  Check the traffic well ahead of you to avoid wasteful accelerations and decelerations.  Take your foot off the accelerator as soon as you see a red light or slowed traffic ahead.
<LI>Accelerate smoothly and moderately.  Reach your desired speed, and then keep just enough pressure on the accelerator to maintain steady speed.  On the highway, cruise control can help you do this.
