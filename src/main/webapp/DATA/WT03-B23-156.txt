				If you decide to make bonds a part of your investment portfolio,
				you need to decide which bonds you want to buy and how you want
				to structure them in your portfolio. In a world of falling interest
				rates, it is easy to become a yield junkie and seek out the highest
				possible return by buying long-term bonds. However, if interest
				rates were to rise in the future, a single bet on long-term bonds
				would leave you with an under-performing portfolio. If, for some
				reason, you had to sell your bonds early, you may have to offer
				them at a discount because the newer ones being issued have a
				higher yield and pay more interest.<BR>

				<I><B>Bond Laddering</B></I><BR><BR>
				One of the simplest methods of protecting yourself against interest
				rate risk is to structure a <STRONG>bond ladder</STRONG> with each rung
				consisting of a different maturity bond. At its simplest, a laddered
				portfolio would consist of bonds with maturities of one year,
				two years, three years, right on out through 10 years. Although
				bond laddering won't produce higher yields than you could
				receive by only buying 20-year bonds, it does provide an element
				of safety through diversification that you don't have if your
				portfolio is invested entirely in long-term bonds. As each &quot;rung&quot;
				matures, you receive both new money to invest and some protection
				from rising rates. You also have some protection from falling
				rates because you have locked in higher yields on the rungs with
				longer-term bonds. The nice thing about laddering is that it's
				simple and requires minimal maintenance.

		<P>
				<I><B>Other Strategies</B></I><BR><BR>
				There are other strategies such as &quot;bar belling,&quot; &quot;liability
				matching&quot; and &quot;buying the yield curve.&quot; However,
				before you begin implementing any of these methods you need to
				examine the risks and rewards of each one and should take into
				account such parameters as cash needs (how much income do you
				need?), risk tolerances, time horizon (when do you need the income?),
				and economic projections.
	
		<P>
				For those who choose not to structure their own bond portfolio,
				other avenues for investing in fixed-income securities are available.
				Investors can seek professional management help by using either
				<A HREF="mubond.htm">Bond Funds</A> or <A HREF="port.htm">Personalized Portfolio 							Management</A>.
				The choice depends on how much assistance you want and how much
				money you have to invest.<BR>

		<P>
				Investors can choose from a variety of fixed-income funds that
				range from security-specific investments such as U.S. government
				bond funds and tax-exempt funds or a fund that invests within
				a certain maturity range, for example five to 10 years. Basically,
				there is a fund to suit every taste. Investors committing larger
				amounts of money, usually $100,000 or more, can invest through
				professional money managers who will structure a portfolio to
				accommodate their personal needs as well as provide a host of
				additional services.
