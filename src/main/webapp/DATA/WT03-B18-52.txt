<p>Proteus is not a vehicle, but a configurable architecture for
control systems, composed of a hybrid between a highly structured
hierarchical control system and a purely distributed layered
control organization based on subsumption. The system is
hierarchically partitioned, and layered at each level of the
hierarchy, with the addition of cooperative functions. Proteus is
an extension of the &#145;event and action&#146; scheduler, as it
is event-based and the concept of subsumption is applied. The
system is made up of several basic components (called atoms),
each one having its own function, input and output. All these
general-purpose components can be stored in a library and reused,
so that constructing a particular mission simply consists in
choosing the required components from the library and defining interconnections.
Events are data flows linking some components and activating
their actions. In order to achieve more reliable results, the
technique of cooperation is used, sometimes allowing atoms to
share the same actuator rather than merely acting in a
subsumptive way. To solve problems related to interaction between
components with different speeds, a hierarchical structure is
implemented with a supervisory system of some kind. This can be,
for example, a Navigation Module which generates points for the
Heading Control module, which in turn generates commands for Actuator
Control. Missions are composed of sequences of operations called
tasks: to represent and configure a mission, the operator uses a
particular language to give instructions through a &#145;script
editor&#146;. A script is a collection of sequential steps, each
of which may contain more than one task to perform. </p>

<p>A typical control cycle for the system can be defined by the
concept of situation differentiation: on the basis of the idea that
&#147;to perceive is to distinguish&#148; , actions are decided
in relation to what is perceived as happening in the environment:
the sensors play the key role of differentiating situations to
allow the appropriate actions to be performed. The state of
sensors, actuators and the environment is represented by three
state vectors, whereas connections between them represent
functions linking the different states. Sensor space provides all
vehicle control information and is able to differentiate between
situations. Actuator space controls vehicle actuators and thus
influences environmental status. Environment space represents the
real world as influenced by actuators and perceived by sensors:
it determines whether the goal of a given task has been reached.
This control structure has been tested on ISER&#146;s ARCS AUV,
and used on the Theseus (in the picture) vehicle. </p>
