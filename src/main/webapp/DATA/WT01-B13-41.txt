<P>

As an economist, I am alarmed by the results of the recent Kemper-Roper
Retirement Monitor, a survey conducted to report on American attitudes
and expectations regarding retirement. Specifically, the finding that a
regular savings account was the most popular individual investment
(after the company-sponsored 401(k)) for retirement - across all age
groups - is very sad. 
<P>

When you consider the language that Americans use when talking about
retirement, this should not be surprising. When we talk about planning,
for example, we talk about "saving" for retirement. We don't often hear
about investing for retirement. It's a "nest egg" that we try to build,
not an income-generating machine. 
<P>

Why is this sad? I wonder how many people who are "saving" for
retirement today are considering the risk they're taking that their
savings account will tragically fail to provide for the length and
quality of the retirement they can expect - not to mention expensive
health care. While the principal and interest of a savings account is
generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
risk is that the retiree will outlive his or her income from it. 
<P>

These survey results demonstrate that Americans clearly want safety for
their retirement funds. We are not about to overlook the potential for
default, which was a lesson learned well from the 1930s Depression era.
Yet there is another lesson that history can teach us - and it is that
inflation has the potential to erode the real value of our retirement
funds. In the 1970s, returns on savings accounts failed to keep up with
inflation. In the 1980s, savings accounts failed to keep up with
economic growth. It is precisely because rates paid on savings accounts
are not pegged to economic growth or inflation that they fail to keep up
with either. 
<P>

By contrast, other investments have historically provided returns above
the rate of inflation. 
<P>

For appropriate investment guidelines today, we need to look forward not
backward. In the past, Social Security benefits made up the shortfall
between desired income needs and the returns provided by regular savings
accounts. That won't continue, as reduced real benefit levels and higher
taxes are the future for Social Security. 
<P>

Perceptions of risk and required return drive retirement planning. The
popularity of savings accounts as a retirement vehicle suggests that
Americans have a high aversion to risk for their retirement funds but a
very low estimated need for a return. In a world of 3 percent or more
inflation and federal budget cutbacks on Social Security and Medicare,
Americans should recognize that reliance on regular savings accounts is
not a strategy without a risk of its own.
