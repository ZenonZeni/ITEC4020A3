  <STRONG><H3>   Making Your Own Organic Fertilizers</H3></STRONG>
     Growing  pest  free vegetables and fruits is in part dependent  on
not  using chemical fertilizers and, instead, to rely upon the  various
natural resources available to us.  It is not within the scope of  this
book to debate the difference(s) between organics and in-organics;  nor
is  it  my  intent  here  to  show why  you  should  not  use  chemical
fertilizers  or  if  a  plant can tell the difference  between  organic
nitrogen  sources and chemical sources1. I am not here to convince  you
that you should go organic and not chemical2.

 These things you must have decided on your own.  I am here to pass
along  to  you my knowledge of Organics. In this chapter, I will  cover
some  basic ways that you can make your own organic fertilizers. Please
note that there are more and more organic fertilizers available on  the
market today, not all are 100% organic. Read the labels very carefully.
The  physical structure of what we feed the Earth can be modified.  For
example,  a  rock  can be crushed into powder, or garlic  made  into  a
liquid. All these things are still subject to the laws of nature.  They
are Bio degradable and non-toxic.

              <STRONG><H3>The Invisible Gardener says:
            " High Nitrogen fertilizers contribute to  many
                      insect & disease attacks."</H3></STRONG>

     High  nitrogen based fertilizers are like sugar to the human body.
The  rush is great going in, but not the going down! Each time you  use
high  nitrogen, it causes greater stress then before. Beyond  that  you
will  find other causes that attract pests and diseases. High  Nitrogen
is like steroids for plants!


                    <STRONG><H3> The Invisible Gardener says:
    "You can avoid many problems associated with high nitrogen use
simply by understanding the organic system of providing nitrogen as the
                            plant needs it"</H3></STRONG>
