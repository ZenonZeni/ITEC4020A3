<B><I>Summary</I></B>
<P>
New evidence that the rate of Q4 growth approached or exceeded 4% has spooked bond market participants into another “growth scare” backup in long-term interest rates, while the equity markets posted new highs on fund inflows. We believe a 7% yield is possible in the next several weeks, and presents a wonderful buying opportunity as the fears of strong growth/wage acceleration/inflation are overblown. We still see no changes in monetary policy in 1997.

<UL>
<LI><B>Short Term (1 week)</B> --- The US bond market seems to have found some near-term support following the stronger-than-expected December employment report and sanguine inflation reports. Upcoming data, however, argue for more downside risk. Ironically, the near-term support is occurring as we get confirmation that the rate of growth in Q4’96 was much stronger than expected, which  we attribute to renewed inflows into the US Treasury market from foreign accounts. A re-test of the downside of the 110-112 range on the bond contract is still possible as new reports of strength in Q4’96 find their way into the market. istmas sales have been determined. 
<P>
<LI><B>Medium Term (1-3 mos.)</B> --- The rate of inflow into equity mutual funds so far in January confirms that investors were not scared away by the December volatility. Recent comments by Fed officials suggest they are not prepared to tighten policy in the near term based solely on asset inflation. Evidence of stronger albeit a noninflationary rate of Q4 growth is spooking bond market participants, but the consequent backup in interest rates should be viewed as a near-term buying opportunity, since we do not believe Q1’97 growth will be nearly as strong. We have revised up our Q4’96 GDP forecast to 4% based on the latest trade data. Bullish factors -- such as a continuation of the dollar rally, central bank buying of US Treasuries and continued progress on budget deficit reduction to be announced at the mid-January State of the Union -- all bode well for a rally in US bonds this quarter. 
<P>
<LI><B>Long Term (6-12 mos.)</B> ---  US economic fundamentals still argue for a 6%-7% trading range on the long bond in 1997. As mentioned in our commentary dated December 13th: “1997 Economic Outlook: Productivity Growth Leads Expansion into 7th Year,” we see growth moving back to the 3%+ area by the middle to end of 1997. We currently see no substantive imbalances in the economy to justify calling for a recession or overheating.
