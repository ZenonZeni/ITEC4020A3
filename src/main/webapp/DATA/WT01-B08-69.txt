        <p>The Falkland / Malvinas Islands government will be
        investing six million pounds in the expansion of the
        capital Port Stanley. <br>
        A Scottish company was appointed for the project which
        includes the building of eighty new homes and the
        development to the east of Stanley of a network of roads,
        drainage and sewer systems plus the installation of water
        and electricity supply. <br>
        The engineering project is the second most important in
        the history of the islands. <br>
        Since the end of the 1982 conflict and the fishing boom,
        Stanley has suffered a severe shortage of housing which
        is believed has inhibited the growth of the population.
        With the prospects of oil the demand for new homes and
        building plots has increased. <br>
        Port Stanley at present has approximately 300 houses. <br>
        A recent population and housing census taken early this
        year and whose results will be released in the coming
        weeks, should help to have a more exact picture of the
        situation </p>

        <p>Three prominent members of the Falklands / Malvinas
        Islands community will be participating in the coming
        Argentine-British Conference (ABC) to be held next
        October in the northern Argentine city of Salta. The
        three businessmen who anticipated to the Falklands /
        Malvinas press that they would be participating are Lewis
        Clifton, a Director of Byron Holdings Ltd. and of Desire
        Petroleum; Terry Betts of JBG Falklands Ltd. a fishing
        company and Robin Lee one of the strongest farmers of the
        islands and co-owner of White Rock Ltd. an important
        local public works contractor. <br>
        Although the three of them at one time held office as
        elected members of the Falklands' Legislative Council, no
        present Councillors accepted the invitation from ABC, a
        non government organization which was created to discuss
        political relations and cultural links between Argentina
        and Great Britain. <br>
        The three businessmen from the islands will be going as
        part of the British delegation which includes several
        outstanding and influential personalities from London
        circles with very close links and interests in Argentina. <br>
        The meeting is officially scheduled for October 25-27 and
        ABC's host this time will be the Argentine Foreign
        Relations Council, a non government organisation which
        sponsors international visits and conferences. This will
        be the sixth meeting of ABC, the last was held last year
        in Oxford, England. <br>

        LINK WITH CHILE </font></h3>
        <p>DAP the Chilean carrier which has been flying to the
        Falklands / Malvinas from Punta Arenas since 1991 has
        been promised additional financial help from the islands'
        government until March 1997. <br>
        The sum which has a limit of £ 75.000, was decided by
        the Executive Council to ensure DAP's Boeing 727
        connection with Punta Arenas and then onto Santiago to
        catch regular British Airways flights to London. <br>
        The Chilean company covers most of the southern tip of
        South America including Ushuaia in Argentina, with small
        aircraft such as the Twin Otter (ten seats) which use to
        fly weekly to Port Stanley. <br>
        Since January this year DAP began flying twice a week to
        Mount Pleasant Airport with a Boeing 727 which has a 125
        seat capacity, but has had greater than expected
        difficulties in booking the aircraft in spite of the
        tempting and attractive fares of the British Airways
        connection in Santiago. <br>
        To begin the Boeing 727 shuttle, DAP received an initial
        financial assistance from the Falklands' government of
        almost 180.000 US dollars. <br>
        The Falkland / Malvinas Islands Development Corporation
        and the Chilean company estimate that the summer tourist
        turnover, when cruise ships sailing to Antartica change
        passengers and crews, will prove the project a success. <br>
        At present DAP has cut the link to a weekly flight and
        many times is covered by a Twin Otter. The Falklands also
        has a two times a week connection with Britain, with an
        only stop in Ascension Island, in the RAF'S Tristars
        military transport which have a limited capacity for
        civilians. </p>

        HUNT OPTIMISTIC </font></h3>
        <p>Desire Petroleum, an oil company based in Britain and
        with an important participation of Falklands'
        shareholders has very good chances of obtaining a licence
        to explore in some of the best off-shore trenches round
        the islands, according to Rex Hunt who was governor of
        the Falklands during the 1982 conflict. <br>
        Rex Hunt who is vicepresident of Desire Petroleum made
        these comments after it was announced that two important
        oil companies, from Texas and Norway, would not be
        joining Desire in the exploration consortium as had been
        anticipated. <br>
        Both companies were expected to become the second most
        important partners in Desire, of which Lasmo
        International from Scotland holds 50% of the shares. <br>
        Falklands shareholders have contributed to Desire with
        over half a million pounds. The Norwegians walked out
        because they disagreed with Lasmo's plans to drill two
        wells during the first (five years) stage of the
        exploration licence. </p>

        <p>The environmental group Greenpeace is following
        closely the off shore oil exploration process round the
        Falklands and has anticipated it could actively oppose
        the industry. <br>
        &quot;<em>We are keeping a close look at the development
        of the oil industry particularly in frontier areas such
        as the Falklands which are marginal and involve new
        sophisticated technologies</em>&quot;, remarked Paul
        Horseman. <br>
        Horseman heads the British chapter of Greenpeace and was
        responsible for the successful campaign against the
        sinking by Shell of the Brent Star oil rig in the north
        Atlantic. <br>
        &quot;<em>The Falklands ecosystem has a very rich wild
        life and the South Atlantic is exposed to some of the
        strongest winds in the world which makes the risks of oil
        spills very dangerou</em>s&quot;, added Horseman. <br>
        Horseman refused to say if Greenpeace was planning any
        protests in the Falklands area, but &quot;<em>our
        merd0ers are ready to jump aboard any moment</em>&quot;. <br>
        In October the government of the Falklands / Malvinas is
        expected to announce the consortiums which will be
        licensed to explore for oil and the trenches where
        operations will begin. </p>

        <td colspan="2"> <h3><strong>COUNCILLOR'S DEATH FORCES
        BY-ELECTION </strong></h3>
        <p>The death of one of the leading politicians and
        Councillors of the Falklands / Malvinas, John Cheek,
        (57), has caused grief and sadness in the islands and
        will force a by-election in the coming weeks, just one
        year before the eight members of the Council face a
        general election. <br>
        John Cheek a successfull islander who was one of the
        first to grasp the opportunities of the fishing industry
        in the Falklands&nbsp;/ Malvinas following the 1982
        conflict, was first elected to office in 1981 and had
        become the most influential of all Councillors. <br>
        Pragmatic in his understanding of relations with
        Argentina, (he favoured discussions on fisheries and
        oil), Councillor Cheek nevertheless was decisive in
        ensuring the publication of a Councillors' document on
        the future of the Falklands&nbsp;/ Malvinas based on the
        concept of a &quot;secure independence&quot;. <br>
        In 1982 when the Argentine invasion of the islands Cheek,
        was in Britain and spent the ten weeks of the war
        broadcasting daily to the Falklands&nbsp;/ Malvinas and
        acting with the then Governor Rex Hunt as a Falklands /
        Malvinas government in exile. <br>
        With &quot;Fortuna&quot;, the islands' first wholly owned
        fishing company, John Cheek was also able to show his
        talent as a businessman which turned him into a wealthy
        man and leading member of the community. <br>
        The Governor of islands Richard Ralph described Cheek as
        &quot;<em>an exceptional Councillor, a Falklands patriot
        and a worthy son of the islands</em>&quot;. <br>
        Cheek was elected three times as a Councillor and
        resigned after chairing a government committee in late
        August, just a few hours before his death caused by a
        long battle against leukemia. </p>
