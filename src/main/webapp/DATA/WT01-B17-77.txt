<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>How the Fruit of an Evergreen Tree 
<BR>Can Help You Lose Weight</CENTER></H3>

There are two evergreen trees  called Garcinia cambogia and Garcinia indica,
common to India, that contain a compound that may be a key to a new approach to
weight control.  
<P>Normally, the he he  dried rind of the fruit of G. cambogia makes a pungent
condiment for Indian curries, but in the last 30 years researchers have
discovered it also contains a natural chemical ingredient called hydroxycitric
acid. This substance, when prepared synthetically (commercially called Citrin&reg;) 
can make major changes in how much you
weigh and whether you gain any more unplanned  weight.

<P>When taken as a dietary supplement, Citrin can accelerate fat-burning, prevent
your body from making new fat tissue, block fatty acid ken as a dietary
supplement, Citrin can accelerate fat-burning, prevent your body from making
new fat tissue, block fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, supress appetite, and 
promote cardiovascular health, according to a number of studies. In a 1987 study of 
obese men, taking 800 mg daily for 1 week produced an average weight loss 
of 3.5 pounds a man.

<P>A 1994 study of 75 volunteers  supported
Citrin's reputation as a weight-loss leader. In this study there were 60 women
and 15 men, ages 21-65 and weighing 135 to 253 pounds. They took a Citrin
supplement that included 250 mg of hydroxycitrate and 100 mcg of chromium. 
Although all were reasonably healthy, 74% had higher than normal blood lipid
levels and 53% were on prescription drugs for either  elevated lipids or being
overweight.  

<P>After 8 weeks on the program, 42 people, or about 55%, lost an average of 10.8
pounnds each;
11 showed important drops in their cholesterol and triglyceride levels; and 8
had significant reductions in their blood glucose levels.

<P>For the approximately 50% of American women and 25% of men who are on some kind
of diet every day, perhaps
this obscure ingredient from the rind of an
Indian evergreen tree may hold an answer to losing weight naturally. 

<P>Citrin is available in a supplement called Slim &amp; Healthy, an appetite control formula in
capsule form from America's Finest, Inc., 3481 Old Conejo Road #101, Newbury Park, CA 91320; tel: 800-350-3305.

<A NAME="MAITAKE"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The "Dancing Mushroom" 
<BR>May Be The New Healing King</CENTER></H3>

Prized for centuries by Japanese herbalists for its ability to strengthen health, 
Maitake mushroom (which means "dancing mushroom") is now being investigated in Japan
and America for its healing abilities in a number of diseases.

<P>AIDS. A maitake extract can prevent the destruction of certain immune cells (T-helper
lymphocytes) by HIV by as much as 97% and it also appears to reduce the growth of 
Kaposi's sarcoma.

<P>DIABETES. Studies with mice show that maitake can keep blood glucose levels from rising and 
keep blood serum insulin and triglyceride levels lower by almost 50%.
<A NAME="WEIGHT"> </A>
<P>WEIGHT LOSS. A Japanese researcher gave 30 patients a powdered maitake
suplement at the rate of 20 tablets daily of 500 mg
each for 2 months; no other factors in their diets were changed. All 30 patients lost from
1.4-5.5 lbs or about 2.3-2.7 lbs on the average per person.
<A NAME="FIBROIDS"> </A>
<P>UTERINE FIBROIDS. An American M.D. gave my maitake to 6 patients with uterine fibroids 
at the
rate of 2 tablet, 3 times daily (3 g). After 6-12 months on this program, none of the women
required surgery and all of them had substantial reduction in fibroid size.

<P>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. In over 30 cases, maitake mushrooms gradually decreased hig blood 
pressure to normal levels.
<UL><LI>A woman, age 61, had taken hypotensive drugs for 20 years but could never get her 
systolic blood pressure lower than 150; it was usually 190. After
taking maitake at 5 g daily for 30 days, it went down to 130. 
<LI>A man, age 73, saw his blood pressure drop from 170 to 128 after taking 4 g daily for
only 3 weeks. 
<LI>A diabetic man, age 45, reduced his blood glucose from 139 to 80 and his blood pressure from 165
to 132 after only 3 weeks, taking 4 g daily. 
<LI>A heavy drinker, aeavy drinker, a and his blood pressure from 165 to 132
after only 3 weeks, taking 4 g daily. A heavy drinker, age 48, dropped his blood pressure
from  180 to 130 in only 2 weeks at the rate of 3 g daily of maitake.

<A NAME="Wound"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Fast Wound Healing With Amino Acids</CENTER></H3>
Next time you have a serious wound or altogether unavoidable surgery, 
consider the merits of L-arginine,
an amino acid, to speed up your wound healing. 

<P>Normally, you consume about 5 g a day of L-arginine in the average Western diet.
In addition, your kidney makes more, synthesizing it from its precursor,
L-citrulline. But when your body sustains an injury or surgical cal wound, you
need a lot more L-arginine to keep all systems running smoothly. Otherwise, you
start losing nitrogen and body weight.

<P>Numerous studies show the benefits of taking supplemental L-arginine before and
after surgery.  Surgical patients  who took 15 grams daily of L-arginine for 3 days lost much less nitrogen (important to wound
healing) than patients under conventional nutrition.  Patients undergoing
surgery for gastrointestinal tumors who took 25 g a day for 7 days had a much
improved nitrogen balance a week after surgery than those who had no supplementation.

<P>Probably the most impressive study came out in Surgery in 1990. Here, 36
patients were divided into 3 groups: one group had a placebo; a second took 17
g of L-arginine daily; and the third took 24.8 g-all for 14 days. All the
subjects were surgically wounded, then the scientists sat back to watch the
healing process. Both L-arginine groups showed enhanced wound healing and a
significant increase in the amount of collagen made at the wound site, a key
index for wound healing.
<A NAME="ARGI"> </A>
<P>Besides accelerating wound healing, L-arginine seems to enhance the size and
function of the thymus gland, which is a vital player in the human immune
system. The amino acid also appears to stimulate the release of growth hormone
from the pituitary gland in the brain.  This fact alone may account for the
positive effect of L-arginine on both wound healing and immune system
enhancement. 

<P>Medical researchers speculate that one of the main reasons for the decline of
both immune function and muscular strength with age is because of a dramatic
drop in growth hormone secretion. This implies that L-arginine supplementation
may have an anti-aging effect on the body.

<P>L-arginine supplements are available through The Vitamin Shoppe, 4700 Westside
Avenue, North Bergen, NJ, 07047; tel: 800-223-1216. Call for their 150 page

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Cancer Remedy-From the Throats of Cows to You</CENTER></H3>

Long before there was shark cartilage, there was cartilage from the trachea of
cows. One hundred cases suggest that bovine
tracheal cartilage may gain its rightful place in the roster of effective
anti-cancer remedies.

<P>Back in 1954, John F. Prudden, M.D., discovered that bovine cartilage had a
remarkable ability to help wounds heal faster. In fact, bovine tracheal cartilage
today is one of the few substances proven to accelerate wound healing, which is
why most surgical textbooks mention it. But Dr. Prudden became deeply intrigued
with the wider therapeutic potential of this obscure substance. When he watched
it dramatically shrink a breast tumor and reduce the malignant ulceration of the
chest wall of a desperate patient, he was hooked for life. 

<P>Since the 1950s, Dr. Prudden has sponsored more than $7 million worth of
clinical studies and documentented 100 cases in which bovine tracheal cartilage
made a big difference in treating cancer.  Not surprisingly,  William Lane,
Ph.D, the proponent of shark cartilage, acknowledges that Dr. Prudden is "the
father of cartilage therapy." A quick look at Dr. Prudden's case book helps make
the point.

<P>In a now classic study released in 1985, Dr. Prudden reported on the results of
a trial with 31 cancer patients all of whom had failed to respond to
conventional therapies or had a cancer that was not treatable at all. After 
starting a regimen of cartilage-typically 9 grams daily, taken
orally in 3 g installments 3 times daily-90% of the patients had a partial or
complete response. 

<P>Dr. Prudden also reports success in causing a large rectal tumor to disappear,
leaving the patient cancer-free for 18 years
after treatment. Bovine cartilage produced a complete healing of breast cancer
after all other therapies failed; this patient remained free of cancer for 10
years until her death from other causes. A man with prostatic cancer that
had spread to the bones had a complete remission. 

<P>As impressive as these early 
results sound, bovine tracheal cartilage is not a cancer cure
but a successful palliation. It's not, strictly speaking, a cure because patients who
respond to it must continue taking it at the rate of 9 g daily for the rest of their lives to avoid a possible remission. It also
takes up to 4 months for the initial positive effects to show up in the system, Dr. Prudden
advises. In more than 25 years, he
has never observed any toxic side effect from using bovine cartilage, even with doses 3 times as high as the therapeutic
dose.

<P>While shark cartilage is grabbing the lion's share of media attention these
days, there are certain facts about bovine cartilage that may recommend it as a
worthy contender in
the cartilage-against-cancer field. 

<P>For example, while it takes about 70 g of shark cartilage to get healing
results, you need only 9 grams of bovine cartilage.  In terms of how much you need to
take (therapeutic dose), bovine cartilage is 4 times less expensive than shark
cartilage. Shark cartilage is 22% calcium, which puts 14 times the normal RDA
for calcium into your system which might be too much. By comparision, bovine cartilage at  therapeutic dosage
has only 10% of the calcium RDA and it contains a chelating substance that helps
remove excess calcium from your system.

Foundation for Cartilage and Immunology Research, 104 Post Office Road,
Waccabuc, NY, 10597; tel: 914-763-6195. For information on  Vita-Cart, a

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>A 2000 Year Old Medicine from Deer Antlers</CENTER></H3>

The cartilage of antlers fm the velvet deer is poised to be one of the most 
versatile multipurpose
natural remedies to arrive in the West. The Chinese have known about it for at
least 2 millennia according to an ancient medical scroll that recommends it for
52 health problems. Russsians have
used velvet deer antler for decades, especially as an endurance-building
supplement called Pantocrine for athletes. And for those living in Asia, Korea,
and New Zealand, velvet deer antler is a medicinal food in high demand.

<P>The medicinal claims for velvet deer antler are comprehensive and ambitious, 
and preliminary
research tends to support most of them. 
Among the numerous claims, velvet deer antler can: 
<UL><LI>increase the quality and quantity of blood production in treating kidney
disorders and anemia;
<LI>treat infertility in women and impotence in men;
<LI>modulate the immune system, bringing it back to an even keel when it it's
depressed or overactive;
<LI>improve blood circulation, reverse atherosclerosis, and possibly reduce the
incidence of fatal heart attacks;
<LI>increase muscular strength and nerve function;
<LI>and generally boost energy.
</UL>

In 1992, a New Zealand magazine published a story about a woman who cured her 
arthritis after taking velvet deer antler for 2 years. The story also chronicled a 
woman with multiple
sclerosis who  reduced her aches and pains by taking the substance for 2 years.

<P>What's in the antlers that can produce effects like these? Cartilage, for one,
which contains a substance which speeds up wound healing. 
The antlers also contain an anti-inflammatory
substance (chondroitin sulfate) that in concentrated form has been shown to
reduce  the incidence of fatal heart attacks reportedly by 400%, according to
one 6 year study. A natural growth is found in high  levels in velvet deer
antlers; this substance helps to keep the body lean and the muscles well-developed.

<P>Velvet deer antler is available as a powdered capsule (250 mg each) from the
Prolongevity brand. The recommended dosage is 1-4 capsules per day for 4 weeks followed 
by 1 week off; 
users are advised that it may take 6-12 weeks to notice effects.
