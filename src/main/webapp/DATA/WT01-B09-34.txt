Hawaii has had a close relationship with the U.S.
Armed Forces long before it became the 50th state. And today,
that association is more prevalent than ever, making the Aloha
State a natural to serve as the hub for one of the seven consortia
on the ARPA team. </FONT>
<P>
All military services are represented within a 375-square
mile area adjacent to Honolulu and stand ready as the power projection
base for the Pacific Theater. To that end, the Hawaii Electric
Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP) is developing technology
for military vehicle application and demonstrating capabilities
on commercial and military vehicles. </FONT>
<P>
Managed by the High Technology Development Corporation,
an agency of the State's Department of Business, Economic Development
and Tourism, the HEVDP Consortium has 40 participating companies/agencies
representing 11 states throughout the country.<BR>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The HEVDP mission</FONT></h3>
<P>
The HEVDP mission includes:</FONT>
<P><ul>
<li> Maximizing the number of commercial and military
electric vehicles on state roads; <BR>
<li> Developing an electric vehicle infrastructure
with conversion, assembly and servicing facilities as well as
charging stations;<BR>
<li> Operating an Electric and Hybrid Vehicle National
Data Center to collect, analyze, store, report and share electric
and hybrid vehicle data for all seven consortia through the Internet
and World Wide Web;<BR>
<li> Advancing the development of technology to
meet military and commercial electric vehicle needs. </FONT>
<P></ul>
These activities are energizing the transportation
technologies industry in Hawaii, which creates high quality jobs
and improves economic competitiveness.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3>
<P>
The first phase of this project, which is drawing
to a close, resulted in a $10.7M cost-sharing program among federal
and state governments and private companies. The second phase
is just beginning and the magnitude of the program has increased
to a <B>$17.7M cost sharing effort</B>. These initial two phases
will result <B>in over 60 vehicles operating on Hawaii roads,</B>
to include small composite utility vehicles, sedans, pickup trucks,
buses and a trolley. Operators include the Navy at Pearl Harbor
Naval Station and the Air Force at Hickam Air Force Base, as well
as the Hawaiian Electric Company and the Honolulu Public Transit
Authority. Additionally, plans call for <B>converting the two
diesel engines driving a Navy Shuttle Boat to electric motors.</B>
To further develop an electric motor used for a prototype tank,
variants are being installed in the <B>shuttle boat</B> and<B>
a 40-foot bus, the first electric transit bus of this size. </B>Other
accomplishments include establishing an electric vehicle conversion
facility and opening a composite, lightweight electric vehicle
production facility. These activities, along with state legislature-proposed
incentives for electric vehicle sales and use, demonstrate the
commitment of the State of Hawaii to take a lead in the electric
transportation industry. <BR>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3>
<P>
Future plans call for extensive battery testing and certification
to extend the operating range of existing and projected electric
vehicles, and developing more powerful electric motors to meet
the specifications for light- and medium-weight tactical vehicles.
The National Data Center will continue to expand its capabilities
to include simulation, analysis/visualization and a virtual electric
vehicle laboratory. With strong interests in protecting the clean
environment which we enjoy, the State of Hawaii actively supports
this expanding industry and its positive impact on our citizens
and the Armed Forces.
