BRIEFS


IIA rips internal audit outsourcing

ORLANDO, FLA.  - Terming the move by CPA firms into internal auditing "a
threat to the objectivity and independence of the audit process," the
Institute of Internal Auditors is calling on federal regulators to impose new
mandates on outsourced internal audits.

Companies should be forced to disclose the practice in their annual reports,
said IIA president William G.  Bishop in a letter to Securities and Exchange
Commission chief accountant Michael Sutton.

"If a public accounting firm performs all the internal auditing activities on
an outsourced basis, it becomes, at the very least, an indirect advocate of
management's assertion" over its internal control structure, said Bishop.

"An organization's external auditor cannot assume significant responsibilities
for performing internal auditing and, at the same time, retain its
independence in both fact and appearance," the IIA said in a new position
paper.


Coopers fees up 7% to $1.9 billion

NEW YORK - Coopers & Lybrand said its United States revenue for the year ended
in September gained 7 percent from 1994, to $1.905 billion.  Overall
consulting revenue gained 15 percent, led by a 45 percent growth in fees from
information and communications industry clients.  Business assurance services
gained 5 percent and the tax practice expanded 12 percent.  Worldwide, the
firm reported a 13 percent sales advance, to $6.2 billion.

U.S.  fee growth was led by a 30 percent gain in the firm's pharmaceuticals
and chemicals sector, 29 percent in media and entertainment, 20 percent each
in insurance and health care, and 15 percent in high tech.  The firm's human
resources advisory line grew 16 percent, to become one of the top five such
consulting practices in the nation, Coopers said.


Moss Adams acquires Kimball Dixon

SEATTLE - Regional firm Moss Adams has acquired local Medford, Wash., firm
Kimball, Dixon & Co., bolstering its West Coast presence.

The $59 million Moss Adams now has 17 offices from Canada to Mexico, with a
concentration in Oregon, said managing partner Bob Bunting.  "We're filling in
that I-5 corridor, growing geographically," he said.  "We've done very well
positioning ourselves as a dominant firm in small markets."

The six partners and 16 employees of the $2 million Kimball Dixon join Moss
Adams, said managing partner Ron Dixon, who initiated the merger talks two
years ago.


CLR buys PW tax software

CARROLLTON, TEXAS - Computer Language Research took another step to make
itself the dominant player in corporate taxation with the purchase of Price
Waterhouse's tax software line.

CLR acquired Price's TMS software for about $15 million.  The price includes
$11 million for the software and the remainder for accrued support liability.
CLR is also planning to hire from 125 to 135 Price employees.  By comparison,
CLR had 947 employees when it issued its annual report earlier this year.

Price Waterhouse has 1,200 TMS users, according to Price spokesperson Jan
Butler.  But that number includes licenses, which several individuals could
have access to at a particular site.  Butler declined to discuss TMS revenue.

Price also agreed that CLR's GoSystem 2 will be its exclusive in-house
preparation line.  CLR has a similar arrangement with KPMG Peat Marwick.  As
part of the extended transition, Price will dedicate the services of three
partners involved in TMS for the next four or five years.


Corrections

"Homes boggle flat tax planners," (Dec.  11-31, 1995) incorrectly said
taxpayers annually deduct mortgage interest worth $58 million, charitable
contributions of $17 million, state and local taxes of $26 million, and real
estate taxes of $14 million.  In fact, the figures should have been rendered
in billions, not millions.

"Automatic Software puts Big Business on market," Tech Briefs, (Nov.  20-Dec.
10, 1995) reported incorrectly the company's location and phone number.
Automatic Software is based in Los Altos, Calif., (415) 919-2000.

Thomson adds SCS/Compute to Menzies' growing stable


by Robert W.  Scott


ST.  LOUIS - Looking for resources to compete more effectively in a
consolidating market, SCS/Compute will be acquired by giant Thomson Corp.  in
a deal valued at just over $30 million.

The acquisition is the latest in a number of notable deals announced in recent
weeks that signal increasing consolidation.  Others include the purchase of
CCH Inc.  by Dutch publishing giant Wolters Kluwer and Computer Language
Research's purchase of the TMS corporate tax business from Price Waterhouse.

SCS/Compute's own financial position in an increasingly competitive market was
clearly a factor in its decision.  "We've been strapped for resources," said
Robert Nolan, SCS/Compute's founder, chairman, president and chief executive
officer.

Nolan, who plans to remain president and chief executive, said all software
companies were facing strains from high- fixed costs.  "I think that is going
to be exacerbated by Windows development," said Nolan.

Thomson is assigning SCS/Compute to the Research Institute of America Group,
which includes Warren Gorham & Lamont and Practitioners Publishing Co., and is
headed by president Euan Menzies.  Thomson also owns Accounting Today through
a separate subsidiary.

RIA is getting an opportunity to develop a broad line of tax and accounting
products.  SCS/Compute has two tax software packages, LMS/Tax and Tax Machine;
a write-up package, Datawrite; and a growing number of client software titles.

Nolan agreed to sell his 1.1 million shares to Thomson U.S.  Holdings, a
division of Thomson Corp.  of Toronto.  Thomson has launched a tender offer
for another 1.5 million shares outstanding - all at a price of $6.75 a share,
up from recent trading at $2.375.

The deal will cost Thomson more than just the stock price of $17.5 million.
It must also redeem preferred stock and long-term debt owed to SCS/Compute's
major lender.

While growth in the tax preparation market has clearly reached a plateau,
Menzies said he sees opportunity.  "We are confident we can take market share
away from other companies," he said.

But RIA is not getting a market leader in SCS/Compute.

Industry sources rank SCS/Compute at about seventh place in terms of overall
market share.

But Nolan cited Thomson's deep pockets as an important aspect of the deal.
Harvey Stein, executive vice president of Pencil Pushers Software of
Burlington, Mass., agreed, saying "it gives them a base to acquire other
companies."

During the last year, SCS/Compute had made three acquisitions, to mixed
reviews.  SCS/Compute picked up, for example, In-the-Black software, a low-end
package it was forced to rewrite.  In the last quarter, SCS/Compute acquired
SaltWare, a sales tax line, for

$130,000 and stock now worth $54,000.  SCS/Compute also agreed in the last
quarter to buy RAM Software, a tax preparation line with 400 users, for about
$500,000.

FORECAST &REVIEW:  By the numbers:  The top 10 news events of 1995


Death and taxes.  The two constants made plenty of appearances in 1995's
accounting news.

Death claimed an independent Kenneth Leventhal and a logical way to account
for stock options.  Taxes - and what needs to be changed about them - were
discussed everywhere from executives' roundtables to kitchen tables.
Sometimes death and taxes came together, as in the cancellation of last year's
taxpayer compliance measurement program.

But all wasn't gloomy.  Experiments, such as KPMG Peat Marwick's Baymark, and
expansion, such as American Express Tax and Business Services' (dreaded, to
some) growth, breathed fresh air into this year's news.

Through it all, the American Institute of CPAs is undergoing a transformation
that should help members cope with all the issues raised by Accounting Today's
Top 10 stories of 1995.

1.  "Melancon rattles top ranks of AICPA":  When Barry Melancon replaced
long-time AICPA president Philip B.  Chenok July 1, he pledged to reduce
bloat, break down bureaucratic fiefdoms and modernize the institute's
operations.  But he surprised even his closest supporters in October when he
began a massive restructuring with a shake-up of top management ranks.  He
trimmed the number of executive staff positions and directors.  Additional
layoffs of from 5 to 10 percent were expected late last year.  The changes
were made, Melancon said, to focus on an area he targeted as important since
his nomination - delivering products and services members want.  The new and
improved AICPA also launched an advertising campaign aimed at making chief
executives and other decision makers in large companies think of CPAs as
business advisers.  An Accounting Today survey found that not only do CPAs
support advertising that would enhance their image, they would be willing to
spend more than the $3 million the AICPA budgeted for the program.  2.
"Overhaul or not, big changes loom":  If you can't guess what this headline
referred to, you were on a year's vacation.  Yes, alternative income tax
systems - especially the flat tax - were debated ad nauseam in 1995.  In
addition to a flat tax bill proposed by Rep.  Dick Armey, R-Texas, an
Unlimited Savings Allowance plan was proposed by Sens.  Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
Pete V.  Domenici, R-N.M.  Others in Congress called for a national sales tax.
Whatever the philosophy, the message is clear:  The tax system must be
reformed.  And the experts say we're as close as we've ever been to a change
in the current income tax system.  Look for the issue to figure in this year's
presidential campaign.  3.  "Texas board sues American Express":  The Texas
State Board of Public Accountancy joined Florida in its crusade to stop
American Express Tax and Business Services Inc., formerly known as IDS
Financial Services Inc.  The board wants a Texas state court to forbid
American Express from signing its name to any financial statement that implies
that it is an accountant.  The statements also may not contain any wording
indicating it has expert knowledge in accounting unless it complies with the
Public Accountancy Act.  Under the act, the only business entity that can do a
compilation is a CPA firm.  American Express claims that the case is "all
about competition."  4.  "Tort reform leaps hurdle in Congress":  The
accounting profession - and the AICPA - were poised to win the battle for
litigation reform.  The bill would have reduced the financial liability of
accountants for fraud by their corporate clients and limited investors'
ability to collect damages from accountants and others with deep pockets.
Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed the bill late last month.  5.  "Few
mourn as IRS kills TCMP audits":  A collective sigh of relief could be heard
from tax practitioners across the country in late October, when the Internal
Revenue Service announced it was going to indefinitely delay last year's round
of taxpayer compliance measurement program audits.  The IRS had planned to
select 153,000 tax returns and subject their owners to rigorous checkups, but
backed out after Congress refused to fund its entire $8.2 billion proposed
budget.  The IRS conducts the TCMP audits to gauge both the level of voluntary
compliance and the best methods for selecting tax returns for future audits.
The AICPA had been troubled by the IRS' plan to subject all individual TCMP
victims to a "financial status" test or "economic reality" check.  During a
financial status audit, taxpayers are quizzed to find unreported income.  The
so-called "economic reality" checks also caused headaches as practitioners saw
clients answering IRS inquiries about cash on hand at home, in a safe deposit
box or "hidden somewhere."  6.  "'Filing season from hell':  House panel rakes
IRS chief over coals":  The tax world was abuzz and aghast last tax season as
measures used by the IRS to detect fraud were holding up refunds and trying
taxpayer's patience from coast to coast.  Taxpayers claiming the earned income
tax credit didn't receive their cash credit until the IRS double-checked
taxpayers' and dependents' Social Security numbers.  Former H&R Block
president Harry Buckley called last year "without a doubt the most difficult
tax season" when it came to customer dissatisfaction.  Buckley blamed the
complaints on the "IRS' inability to effectively communicate the procedural
changes."  Taxpayers who paid extra to have their returns electronically filed
were especially aggravated at having to wait for their refunds.  7.  "Politics
kills FASB stock options plan":  After more than a decade of study and more
than two years of increasingly acrimonious opposition, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board dropped its plan to force companies to charge
executive stock options against earnings.  The FASB backed down only after it
became clear that pursuing its plan could prompt the Republican-controlled
Congress to seize accounting rule-making from accountants and place it under
government authority.  Constituencies in industry, especially high-tech
interests, claimed the change would have devastated "the fastest growing
segment of the economy.  In the end, the FASB voted to seek only footnote
disclosure."  8.  "Leventhal deal firms up Ernst's real estate muscle":  In a
deal that joined two real estate giants, Ernst & Young acquired Kenneth
Leventhal & Co.  Los Angeles-based Leventhal's operations, once the 11th
largest U.S.  accounting firm, are run as a business unit within Ernst &
Young.  Leventhal's departure left only three second-tier firms:  Grant
Thornton, McGladrey & Pullen and BDO Seidman.  9.  "With $1.9B sale, CCH gains
Dutch uncle":  CCH Inc., the nation's largest tax publisher, was acquired for
$1.9 billion by Netherlands-based Wolters Kluwer NV, a European giant, in a
transaction announced late last year.  The deal ended the 103-year reign of
the Thorne family over a business that now generates $600 million in revenue.
10.  "Peat makes grab for Wall St.  fees with franchise deal":  KPMG Peat
Marwick blazed a financial services trail when it launched an investment
banking unit, called KPMG Baymark, with a group of veteran Wall Street
investment bankers.  The unit is providing private placement debt and equity
financing to Peat's middle-market corporate finance clients.  While Peat
dreamed of the millions of dollars in fees Baymark could generate, some CPAs
questioned whether the firm could maintain its independence with clients who
have signed on to Baymark.

Ethics dilemma has two sides

This is in response to your story ("FBI douses report it wants CPAs to squeal
on clients," Aug.  21-Sept.  10) which refers to a USA Today article,
"Accountants should turn in crooked clients."

From these articles it is assumed that all three entities involved in this
dispute believe that CPAs have few ethical standards.  Your article also
suggests that CPAs are not turning in clients unless the behavior is "so
egregious" that in order for the CPA to avoid being tainted by it, he or she
contact the authorities.

According to the American Institute of CPAs Standards Rule 102 ammended May
20, 1991, "a member ...  shall not knowingly misrepresent facts or subordinate
his or her judgment on others."  Yet, they are following standards by not
informing the Federal Bureau of Investigation about clients because a member
cannot "disclose any confidential client information without the consent of
the client."  CPAs also fear the consequences of whistleblowing, such as
losing the confidence of their clients or, worse, getting fired by the firm.

One of the questions not answered in your article is, what reward is the FBI
willing to offer to CPAs if they do turn in their clients?  If CPAs are
greatly involved in a crime, they would also be prosecuted.  If prosecuted,
these CPAs would be terminated as members of the AICPA.  Arguments from both
sides should be presented in the same article.

Every time CPAs take on new clients, they should use their integrity to decide
whether to get involved with "dirty clients."  CPAs are obliged to protect
their clients, yet they cannot knowingly misrepresent facts.  If they
understand and remain objective, they should be able to control the problem.

Perhaps this issue could be resolved within the AICPA rather than by
outsiders, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.  However, as
ethical and professional behavior will always be, this issue will remain
debatable.

Your report on Linda Pappajohn's recent speech at the AICPA Practice
Management Conference ("Clarity, ranges keys to compensation policies," Nov.
6-19, 1995) included some solid advice on salary issues and compensation
policies.  However, I want to share my surprise at the sample salary ranges in
the article, specifically for marketing directors, which range from a low of
$21,317 to a high of $28,778.

A quick call to Linda informed me that the salary ranges in the chart were
provided to her by the Minn-Dak chapter of the Association for Accounting
Administration.  During our conversation, Linda thought that the low ranges
may reflect the salaries of secretaries with little background in marketing
who have been promoted.

I don't know of a seasoned marketing director who will work within those
salary ranges.  In fact, according to a Gallop & Robinson poll, the average
annual salary for marketing directors in all industries is $80,478.  A loose
rule of thumb among marketing directors in various industries:  You should be
paid 1 percent of a company's gross.

Marketing directors in accounting firms often take on two other roles:
director of public relations - average annual salary $55,500, according to the
Public Relations Society of America - and director of advertising - average
annual salary $61,611, according to Gallop.  Even studies within our own
accounting industry, specifically the Pencor Report, publish that 17 percent
of full-time marketing professionals earn between $50,000 and $75,000
annually.

If there is any validity to the Minn-Dak ranges, it's no wonder that Lee
Berton of The Wall Street Journal reported recently that midsized firms are
having problems competing with the Big Six.  (Incidentally, Boulay, Heutmaker,
Zibell & Co.  is noted in Berton's article as a firm that is prospering by
fighting the Big Six on our own turf with advertising, promotional videos and
client satisfaction programs.)

Regardless of statistics, the truth is accounting firms need marketing
directors who will work as partners with firm management, challenging them to
increase business, market share, opportunities and awareness with marketing
programs and strategic plans.  And believe me, no marketing director of that
caliber will consider working for the salary ranges listed in the Minn-Dak
chart.

If accounting firms are settling for marketing directors with little, if any
experience, and basically leading them by the nose, they will get what they
pay for - small results within their comfort zone.  My advice to accounting
firms, especially since they usually hire one marketing professional and not a
whole department, is to hire the best you can afford.  In this age of fierce
competition, it's breakthrough marketing led by seasoned marketing pros that
will set apart the winners from the losers.

Boards must address unfair competition

The letter to the editor by Bernard Kiely, of New Jersey, ("State boards need
more power," Oct.  9-22) misses the major issue- the unfair competition that
purchasers such as American Express Business Services inherently have.

They are only buying accounting write-up and tax practices to ultimately sell
financial products to their clients.  That is why they can charge far less
than a CPA, who is prohibited by most state boards from doing the same thing.

The Federal Trade Commission was thinking along the same lines when it ruled a
few years ago that CPAs could sell financial products, with full disclosure,
to clients for whom they don't provide audit or review services.

Most state boards are like ostriches with their heads in the sand, living in
the regulated past, and will only be forced to go along with the FTC when
litigated to do so.

This is an issue that affects all CPAs, large and small.

Kevin A.  Lawrence, CPA Los Angeles



Mesonic thanks you for mentioning our Windows 95 Financial Accounting Software
in Tech Briefs ("Mesonic offers Windows 95 accounting," Sept.  11-24).  This
was the first mention in your publication of an accounting software vendor
shipping a Windows 95 accounting software package.

You can imagine our suprise when the next issue of Accounting Today reported
that another vendor claimed to have the first approved Windows 95 accounting
software ("SourceMate claims win with first Windows 95 accounting," Oct.
9-22).  Mesonic would like to challenge this claim.  Mesonic's Windows 95
version has been available since the beta days of Windows 95.

A stringent testing procedure must be successfully completed and verified
prior to a product being awarded the use of the "Designed for Windows 95"
logo.  This testing establishes whether or not a program is eligible to be
submitted to Microsoft for the Windows 95 logo.  Mesonic's software package
WINLine 95 passed this test Sept.  13, 1995.  Furthermore, this same article
states that, "SourceMate is field testing its Visual AccountMate with several
accounts ...  The product is scheduled to have several modules shipping in
November."

WINLine 95 is currently shipping 20 modules, several of which are available
without any wait.  Because WINLine 95 was derived from our NT version, which
has been on the market since 1993, your readers can be assured of a reliable
program and not a first-level release.

WINLine 95 accounting software by Mesonic is truly the "first Windows 95
accounting system" to both pass testing and to be available on the market.

AmEx KOs Fla.  board in CPA title bout

by Sandy Hock


TALLAHASSEE, FLA.  -- In a decision that's expected to sweep the country, a
federal judge ruled that an American Express Tax and Business Services Inc.
manager could call himself a CPA even though he works for a non-CPA-owned
company.

In doing so, Chief Judge Maurice M.  Paul of the U.S.  District Court for the
Northern District of Florida struck down Florida statutes that prohibit a CPA
employed by a nonlicensed accounting firm and performing only non-attest
business services from telling clients that he or she is a CPA.

"This decision will affect most states," said Sarah McKenzie, national
director of firm development and government affairs for Minneapolis-based
American Express Tax and Business Services.  "That's why we brought it to
federal court.  It was a constitutional issue."

In the wake of the decision, American Express was reportedly readying a
massive new expansion program.  The company finished fiscal 1995 in June with
$40 million in fees from about 341 professionals in 55 offices.  High-ranking
AmEx strategists were said to be formulating a plan to reach $200 million in
revenue by the end of the decade.

Chief Judge Paul ruled that the Florida regulation infringed on CPA Stephen
Miller's freedom of speech.

Miller, senior managing director of American Express' Tampa office and lead
plaintiff in the case, expressed relief that his 18-month court battle was
over.

"It's been a real tough year," Miller said after the judgment was handed down
last month.  "Everyone asks if I'm a CPA and I have to give them a lot of
explanation about the legalities of what I can tell them.  It puts a lot of
caution in their minds."

The Florida Board of Accountancy will vote on whether to appeal the decision
to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta at its meeting
this week, said John J.  Rimes III, a Florida assistant attorney general.

"Obviously, the state isn't happy," Rimes said about the Miller case.  "We're
disappointed in the outcome."

Even with the Florida ruling, CPAs working for non-CPA firms should be careful
about how they refer to themselves, Rimes warned.  The U.S.  Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit in California ruled in September that the California
State Board of Accountancy could discipline a CPA affiliated with H.D.  Vest
investment securities for advertising his CPA credentials while also accepting
commissions.  Similar litigation also is pending in Texas and Louisiana, while
a preliminary investigation is underway in Arizona, Rimes said.

"It means there's some confusion out there," Rimes noted.  "There's no
question about that."

If the board doesn't appeal the decision, it could impose a disclaimer for
CPAs who work for firms that aren't regulated by the state, Rimes said.

If the Miller decision holds, it marks the third time in three years that the
Florida board lost a major case.  In June 1994, the U.S.  Supreme Court struck
down a Florida regulation forbidding attorney-CPAs from advertising their CPA
and certified financial planner credentials.  In 1993, the highest court
abolished the board's rule that forbade CPAs from such solicitation activities
as cold calling.

While conceding that fighting such issues as solicitation was an outdated
position, Florida Institute of CPAs executive director Lloyd "Buddy" Turman
insisted that CPAs are dead set in favor of the fight against American Express
on the Miller matter.

And the FICPA maintains that the issue involved is not simply allowing a CPA
to call himself one.  It goes deeper- to the very structure of firms - and the
profession.

"What you end up with is a noncorporate entity being able to provide services
without facing any consequences, except being sued," Turman said.  "Firms will
have a tendency to shuffle licensees in and out of a practice.  If a CPA gets
sued and his license gets revoked for substandard work, you just fire them.
There's no discipline that can be taken against the corporation."

This case, Turman said, "allows you to say you're a CPA, but you don't have to
act like a CPA."

Imagine, he said, a CPA in business who puts together real estate deals with
real estate professionals.  The CPA could take advantage of the "public's
trust for CPAs" by saying he is one, but not perform any of the work
associated with them.

For Miller, however, his case is about his freedom of speech.

"I should have been able to tell the truth," he asserted.  "It was always
awkward.  I'd have to say technically, I've earned my certificate, but the
firm I work for is not a CPA firm.  Unless you ask me, I can't tell you."
Miller, a former Big Six staffer and sole practitioner, began his long,
strange trip against the Florida board three years ago after the board
informed him it didn't like the language his American Express office had used
in a compilation report.  The state then came back jointly against American
Express, which at the time was still called IDS Tax and Business Services.

The action against Miller led American Express to file a suit against the
Florida board in state court in March 1994, charging that the board
discriminated against American Express by holding that its CPA employees could
not prepare third-party statements.  American Express claimed that since
Florida law allows anyone to prepare such statements, it was being unfairly
singled out.  American Express dropped its suit in September 1994 when the
board agreed to allow its CPAs to prepare third-party statements.

American Express renewed its legal efforts in November 1994 when, with Miller
as the lead plaintiff, it decided to test the constitutionality of Florida's
holding-out rule.

American Express had concluded that the June 1994 U.S.  Supreme Court decision
that allowed Orlando attorney-CPA Silvia Ibanez to publicly call herself a CPA
in turn gave American Express employees the right to hold themselves out.
Florida, on the other hand, maintained that the Ibanez case did not clarify
the holding out issue.  That attitude pushed American Express to refile the
suit.

Miller admits that American Express, even though it has only 18 CPAs and a
total of 40 employees in Florida, scares many CPAs in the Sunshine State - and
the rest of the country.

"It's what we represent," Miller explained.  "We're a big corporation with
money behind us.  We have the marketing and operations know-how that local
accounting firms don't.  They think that it gives us an unfair advantage."

In fact, since his legal tussles began, Miller has fielded many telephone
calls from CPAs interested in the American Express system and in hooking up
with the company.  A CPA Miller thought was "interested in joining the fold"
invited Miller and a staff member to visit his office.

"He was antagonistic from the start," Miller recalled.  "I said, 'Why did you
invite us over.' He said, 'You guys are the devil incarnate.  I wanted to know
something about the other side.'"

CONSULTING INSIGHTS:  Microsoft dominance leads tech trends for '96


Crystal balls are cloudy.  But one part of the technology horizon for 1996
remains clear:  it's a Microsoft (desktop) world.

There are technology trends that accountants should consider, such as the
evolution of color laser printing and imaging.  There are market trends,
particularly the continuing consolidation of vendors, that will have more
practitioners buying more software from fewer suppliers.  But in operating
systems and general desktop applications, there's little choice but Microsoft.

Particularly among smaller firms, 1996 is the year to choose whether to move
to Windows 3.1 or to Windows 95.  There's no reason to stick with DOS unless
you are using a computer you should replace, because both Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95 will run DOS applications (Windows 95 runs them very well).

If you are happy with Windows 3.1, stick with it.  There's no compelling
reason for buying 95, although its long file names and improved memory
management are nice, just not critical.

For larger firms, corporate America, consultants and resellers, the choice is
between moving to Windows 95 and Windows NT.  The latter offers stability,
robustness and security- pretty compelling reasons for making a business
decision.  Once Windows NT gets the Windows 95 interface later this year, it's
likely to be the product of choice for heavy- duty users and some consumers.

On the general application side, only in the accounting market is 1-2-3 still
king of the spreadsheet world, and that's not going to last.  Everybody else
uses Excel.  Anybody who attended shows such as PC Expo has got to wonder
about Lotus' (now IBM's) commitment to 1-2-3.  Both the product and name were
invisible in a sea of Notes signs.

And with Novell trying to sell WordPerfect, how many users want to bet on that
product's future in word processing?  The other choice:  WordPro, part of
Smart Suite.  Will that be Microsoft Word or Microsoft Word that your firm
buys?

The major question left in operating systems is whether Microsoft's NT Server
truly will displace Novell's NetWare.  It looks like 1996 will still be a year
of NetWare dominance, with strong gains by NT and the grudging co-existence of
the two products.

The one possible chink in the Microsoft armor:  on-line services.  The
Microsoft Network hasn't taken off yet and for professionals, CompuServe is
still a better service because there are more accountants to talk to on it.

On the Internet, Microsoft would like to repeat its dominance, but here it may
be cut off at the pass by Sun Microsystems and Netscape, both of which support
the Java programming language, an emerging standard.

Market consolidation

There will be more tax and accounting vendors failing or being purchased, with
tax preparation vendors particularly vulnerable.  The need to develop both DOS
and Windows products will simply prove too much for some smaller players.  Add
on likely tax law changes and some companies will simply count their cash and
go home.

Consolidation is not just about changing the number of players.  It's changing
how practitioners buy software.  Instead of buying from many small vendors, it
will be possible to buy a complete tax and accounting line from one source.

Look for the big to get bigger.  Intuit has been flexing its muscles with
development of programs and services such as the Intuit Financial Professional
Program for its Pro Series users.  That's the kind of power that one-product
companies will find hard to match over the long haul.

Movement towards suites will continue.  There is not a true accounting suite
on the market yet.  Micro Vision's Accounting Professional Suite is more of a
bundle of products with different pricing options.  However, true suites, with
build-in interfaces between products, are on the way.

Look for Computer Language Research, CCH Inc., Research Institute of America,
and perhaps Arthur Andersen with its new VantageSource unit, as well as a
number of smaller players, to join this race over the next two years.

The "I" word

Everybody is taking about the Internet.  Surprisingly, it isn't all hype.
But, it remains tough to sell and market most products on the Internet, unless
you are selling a specialty item.

However, the Internet appears to have a bright future in support, distribution
of upgrades and bug fixes, as well as good, old-fashioned electronic mail.

One of the companies pointing to the potential here is SBT Accounting Systems.
It accepts orders via its WebTrader, but since it sells on terms, it doesn't
have to worry about credit card security.

More important, SBT pioneered what founder Robert Davies calls "the poor man's
EDI" (Electronic Data Interchange) and hopes to use the Internet to seriously
cut product returns.

That combination of cost cutting and customer service represents the potential
for 1996.  And many tax preparation vendors are also recognizing the back
office/support potential.  Internet support is going to augment, if not
replace, some conventional bulletin board-based support systems.

Technologies to consider:

* Imaging.  Accountants are only now waking up to the cost of storing
documents.  Imaging is beginning to make an impact at smaller firms which are
the early adopters of technology.  * Video conferencing.  This has been a hot
topic in the broader computer market.  Pricing just hasn't come down enough.
In 1996, it's not quite there yet for smaller businesses and firms.  *
Hand-held computers.  If you didn't need them in 1995, you won't need them in
1996.  * Color laser printing.  The price is not yet low enough to make color
indispensable.  But it's getting close.  It won't be long before we all wonder
what anybody is doing with just a plain black ink printer.  * Wide area
networking.  Any firm with more than one office should at least look at
alternatives to plain old telephone service.

FASB rules on nonprofits' investments


NORWALK, CONN.  - The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued a new
rule on how not-for-profit organizations should account for certain
investments.

Statement 124, "Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations," is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec.  15, 1995.
The statement is the fourth to result from the FASB's project to resolve areas
of inconsistency in accounting and reporting by not-for-profits.

Statement 124 requires not-for-profit organizations to report at fair value
investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values and all
debt securities, with gains and losses reflected in a statement of activities.
The statement also establishes standards for reporting losses on investments
held under a donor's stipulation to invest a gift in perpetuity or for a
specified term.

"Although a significant number of not-for-profit organizations currently
report all investments at fair value, inconsistencies exist because existing
guidance permitted alternatives," said FASB project manager Susan Weiss.  "The
board believes that fair value more accurately measures the resources a
not-for-profit organization has available to provide its mission-related
services."

Pentagon battles $20 billion in bad accounting


WASHINGTON - Financial record keeping at the Department of Defense is in such
disarray that the Pentagon can't account for more than $20 billion in military
expenditures.

But that's the good news, Defense financial officers told Congress.  As
recently as June 1993 the military had nearly $50 billion in "problem
disbursements" - payments which could not be matched with any obligations -
and dramatic progress has been made since then, they said.

As evidence, Pentagon officials noted that the department expects to overpay
defense contractors by "only" $270 million in FY 1995.  Two years ago,
military overpayments to contractors were approaching $800 million annually,
Defense Comptroller John J.  Hamre said in a letter to Congress.

For their part, however, members of the House government reform subcommittee
expressed little appreciation for the recent improvements in the department's
accounting systems.  Subcommittee Chairman Steve Horn, R-Calif., who summoned
a parade of military accountants to explain the Pentagon's chronically mangled
books, told Defense financial officers that in the private sector their
substandard accounting practices wouldn't pass muster even for "Mom and Pop"
businesses.

Democrat Carolyn Maloney of New York offered an even harsher appraisal,
calling the department's bookkeeping practices "a disgrace to American
fighting men and women."

Military financial officers acknowledge the extent of these problems, but say
they date back to before their watch.

"When I arrived, I learned that the department had serious problems in
matching obligations and disbursements," Hamre said, but these difficulties
"go back 50 years to the founding of the department."

Defense Inspector General Eleanor J.  Hill traced the Pentagon's bookkeeping
troubles back even further, noting that during the Revolutionary War, Army
quartermasters balked at financial record keeping on grounds that the military
could not be run like the "plain business of a common storekeeper."

Now "here we are 216 years later in the computer age and we still cannot
supply Congress with an acceptable accounting of expenditures," she said.

Further complicating the situation are the "flawed business practices that
have built up over the past 40 years" within the department's patchwork of
internal accounting systems.

When the department was created at the end of World War II there were more
than 250 major accounting systems in operation throughout the military.  Even
today, those systems remain "largely incompatible" with one another, and only
three of them comply with the Comptroller General's accounting principles and
standards, General Accounting Office assistant comptroller general Gene Dodaro
testified.

To make matters worse, the Pentagon adopted a policy authorizing any one of
the department's 300 financial offices to write checks on behalf of anyone
else in the department - a procedure that created a "cross-disbursing"
nightmare throughout the military.

As a result, checks were written without first verifying whether there was "a
clear path back to the accounting record in one of those 250 accounting
systems," Hamre explained.  "The result was a business practice [and a
culture] of 'pay now, account for it later,'" he said.

Despite these problems, department's comptroller disputed allegations that
"the department's finance and accounting systems are so flawed that you can't
trust the budget we have submitted to you."

Department officials also flatly deny suggestions that the military's
financial reporting mess is the result of any widespread fraud or misconduct.

Although GAO's Dodaro told Congress that CFO Act audits have revealed
continuing "breakdowns in the department's ability to protect its assets from
fraud, waste and abuse," Hamre disputed allegations of sinister intent.

"The bulk of our problems are the product of innocent mistakes inside a very
complex system where typographical errors produce thousands of mismatched
records that require subsequent research," he said in his letter to Congress.

5 New Standards Highlight FASB's 1995 Accomplishments


by Glenn Cheney


NORWALK, CONN.  - In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board rode out
the turbulent wake of its stock compensation project and went on to pound out
five new standards and move several other projects into the public forum.

"All things considered, we made good progress this year," declares Dennis R.
Beresford, chairman of the board.

He has good reason for feeling satisfied.  In the first half of the year, the
board issued three new statements that would go into effect for fiscal years
beginning after Dec.  15, 1995.  Statement 120 established rules on the
accounting and reporting by mutual life insurance enterprises.  Statement 121
established the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets.  Statement
122 deals with mortgage servicing rights.

By the end of the year, two more standards would be issued, and a number of
proposed standards would be released for comment.

Despite the progress, it was the stock compensation furor that attracted the
most attention.  Until the standard was issued in October as Statement No.
123, many companies, public accounting firms, certain commissioners of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and even the U.S.  Senate complained that
the proposed standard was unfair.  The original proposal would have required
companies to recognize stock option compensation as an expense.  The eventual
compromise required only a disclosure of the effects of such compensation.

According to Beresford, however, the fundamental issue was not the recognition
of stock compensation but the recognition of the sanctity of setting standards
in the private sector, a process that should not be influenced by politics or
economic effects.

"The question now is whether we are going to be commended for listening to
what a large majority said," he says, "or whether we will be condemned for
bowing to pressure and encouraging future efforts to get around the
private-sector standard-setting process."

Once stock compensation was out of the way, the board approved its last final
statement of the year.  It was a third standard in a series on not-for-profit
organizations.  Statement No.  124 requires reporting at fair value certain
investments in equity securities and all debt securities.  The new standard
went into effect for fiscal years beginning after Dec.  15, 1995.

Big October harvest

In October the board reaped much of what it had sown over previous months.  A
few days before issuing the stock compensation standard, the board issued an
exposure draft on consolidated financial statements.  If adopted as proposed,
the standard will prescribe when entities should be consolidated and how
consolidated financial statements should be prepared.

A few days later, the board released a special report on hedge accounting and
derivatives.  While it resolves none of the thorny issues that have hindered
progress on this project, it pulls together and analyzes many of the
principles and problems involved.  The board hopes to issue an exposure draft
on this important topic by the middle of 1996.

Then, within a week, the board issued an exposure draft of a proposed
statement on transfers of financial assets.  It resolves long-standing
questions about whether transactions should be accounted for as secured
borrowings or as sales.

Comments on the consolidation and transfers of assets proposals are due in
mid-January.

On a roll, the board issued an Implementation Guide on Statement 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," in
November and planned a draft on the decommissioning of long-lived assets by
the end of the year.  Originally the project had been dedicated to nuclear
power plants specifically, but in 1995 the scope was expanded to include
similar costs, such as those involved at mining or oil drilling sites.

International outlook

In 1995 the board continued to expand its efforts to shed international light
on FASB projects.

"Every project that we work on now has some significant interchange with our
counterparts in other countries," says Beresford.  "This is no longer
something that happens every few years.  It happens constantly."

The board ended the year with two exposure drafts of international scope that
are ready to go but on hold to keep them in step with offshore
standard-setters.  One, a proposed binational statement on disaggregated
disclosures, will not be issued until the board's Canadian counterpart is
ready to issue a parallel document.  The second, a proposed statement on
earnings per share, is ready but waiting for the International Accounting
Standards Committee to release a proposal on the same issue.

In the third quarter of the year the board tackled a key new project on
comprehensive income.  Deliberations have just begun, but the board is already
considering working with standard-setters in other countries to work toward a
standard with international compatibility.

An important document still out for comment deals with the effectiveness of
disclosures.  The board has been torn by conflicting complaints of burdensome
disclosure requirements and a perceived need for more information among the
users of financial information.

The board is also issuing an Invitation to Comment which addresses issues
raised in reports produced by the Association for Investment and Management
Research and the Jenkins Committee of the American Institute of CPAs.
Comments will do much to determine which projects end up on the board's agenda
in future years.

"We think there are some awfully interesting ideas in both of these reports,"
says Beresford.  "But there are so many ideas that we need to do some serious
prioritization."

At year's end, Beresford concluded that 1995 had been productive and had set
the stage for rapid output early in 1996.  Public response to the various
exposure drafts work will do much to guide the board through the new year.

FASB faces 2 departures, rushes to finish projects


NORWALK, CONN.  - After a busy season late in 1995, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board is planning to wrap up as many projects as possible by June
and then size up its future direction according to what needs to be done right
away and what ought to be done over the next several years.

June is a key month because two of FASB's seven board members will be
completing their terms at that time.  Who their replacements will be and where
they stand on various issues is at this point quite unknown.  The board,
therefore, is hurrying to complete most of its current projects while
forestalling work on anything new.

One of the two departing board members, Robert N.  Northcutt, has served as a
voice of experience in corporate accounting.  The other, Robert J.  Swieringa,
comes from an academic background.  The trustees of the Financial Accounting
Foundation are striving to find replacements from those same backgrounds.

"We're trying very hard to finish several of our most important projects
before the two Bobs leave so we don't lose all of the effort they've put in,"
says FASB chairman Dennis R.  Beresford.  "In particular, we'd like to issue
final standards on consolidation policy and procedures, and on transfers of
assets and servicing arrangements.  We also hope to issue an exposure draft on
hedging and derivatives."

A bit further into the future is the leave-taking of chairman Beresford, whose
term expires in mid-1997.  If Beresford has any pet projects he'd like to
escort through the long due-process of setting standards, he'll have to begin
early in 1996.

The board has recently been dedicating itself to strategic planning, something
that was difficult to do during the last decade of responding to the immediate
needs of accountancy.

"We're pretty far along in our strategic plan," Beresford says.  "Over time,
we expect to be more proactive in deciding where financial reporting should be
heading, as opposed to what has primarily been a reactive process.  We'd like
to focus more on tomorrow's problems and less on yesterday's and today's."

One aspect of the board's strategic thought is that the demand for and the
importance of financial reports seems to be declining.

"It has been suggested that instead of looking at nitty-gritty accounting
issues we should be looking at where the financial information package is
going and what part we should play in that," Beresford muses.  "I hope that
over the next year we will be able to develop our game plan for the next five
or 10 years."

Public guidance will come into play in the second half of the year as comments
come in on an Invitation to Comment.  The invitation is a report on action
that has been recommended by the Association of Investment Management and
Research and the Jenkins Committee of the American Institute of CPAs.  The
invitation asks commentators to prioritize possible projects that the FASB
might add to its agenda.

Six months of palpable progress

Between New Year's Day and the Fourth of July, the board hopes to make
palpable progress on a number of important projects.

The comment period for an exposure draft on consolidations policy and
procedures ends Jan.  15.  Public hearings are scheduled for Feb.  20 and Feb.
21, with a final statement possible in the second quarter.

The exposure draft of a statement on transfers of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities seeks comments by Jan.  22.  Public hearings
are scheduled for Feb.  26 and Feb.  27.  If all goes well, a final statement
may be issued by the middle of the year.

The board is hoping that an exposure draft on the closure and removal of
long-lived assets - formerly the project on nuclear decommissioning - also
might be finalized in June.  But, like all other projects, that depends on the
nature of comments received.

By June, the board also hopes to hammer out a long-awaited exposure draft on
hedging and derivatives.

The board plans to release two exposure drafts in January in conjunction with
other standard setters.

A proposed statement on disaggregated disclosures will be released in
conjunction with the Accounting Standards Board of Canada, and a proposed
statement on Earnings Per Share will be released at the same time as a
parallel document coming from the International Accounting Standards
Committee.

The FASB's project on comprehensive income was added late in 1995 and the
board has barely begun to grapple with the issues involved.  Nevertheless, an
exposure draft could be issued fairly early this year because the issues are
relatively limited.

The direction of the board in the second half of the year, then, should prove
interesting.  Two new board members will assume seats at the big table in
Norwalk, Conn., and some strategic thinking may have begun to congeal by then.
July 1, then, just might be springtime at the FASB.

PRACTICE MANAGEMENT FORUM:  For better recruits, target professors, survey
says


Across dozens of campuses nationwide, the battle for tomorrow's business
leaders has intensified.  Recruiting top talent has become more aggressive
than ever and the Big Six have recognized the need to bolster their marketing
efforts.

A consistent presence and favorable reputation with students is fundamental,
but, in this competitive market for superstars, not enough.  To gain an even
greater edge on campus, firms need to strategically target not only the
students, but their professors.

Although the Big Six routinely spend millions of dollars on faculty relations
programs each year, they are receiving a limited return on their investment.
With the exception of Arthur Andersen, which has consistently fostered strong
faculty relations, and Coopers & Lybrand with its recent faculty initiatives,
professors are not impressed.

A new study that measures the effectiveness of these programs reveals that
only a few firms are making a considerable impact.  These firms are spending
their dollars wisely and, in doing so, are positioning themselves to be the
firms of the future.

Until recently, the only method the Big Six had of measuring their reputation
among faculty was through surveys that polled accounting faculty at a large
number of schools.  This method ignores the changes in campus recruiting and
the concentration of resources.

Instead of casting a wide net across hundreds of campuses, many firms are
focusing their recruiting efforts on selected top schools.  In 1986, for
example, one Big Six firm reported hiring just 16 percent of its incoming
class from these top schools.

By 1990, it had hired 26 percent, and now it hires more than 45 percent of new
recruits from its focus schools.  Due to the Big Six's recent, more
specialized recruiting focus at key schools, the sweeping overview of data
collected in past surveys has become extraneous.

In addition, the manner in which the data is collected has caused some firms
to question the survey's accuracy.  To reflect the focused concentration of
campus recruiting and faculty relations, our firm conducted one-on-one
telephone surveys with 150 professors at 59 of the country's top accounting
schools.  The sample included schools such as the University of Chicago, the
University of Illinois, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and
the University of Texas.

To measure the faculty's perceptions of the Big Six, interviewers asked
straightforward questions such as, "which firm has the best relationship with
students and faculty on campus, which firm offers the best advancement
opportunities, and which firm is most successful in growing its practice?"
The study was first conducted in 1993 and repeated in 1995 with 70 percent of
the respondents participating in both.

Distinct tiers have developed

Although the faculty considered all the Big Six firms to be highly reputable
and, at times, difficult to differentiate, they regard Arthur Andersen as the
top firm overall.  Coopers & Lybrand solidified its second place ranking in
1995 by more than doubling its overall score compared to 1993.  Deloitte &
Touche also improved its overall score to place third, while Price Waterhouse,
Ernst & Young and KPMG Peat Marwick all lost votes in 1995.

Arthur Andersen's and Coopers & Lybrand's high rankings were no great surprise
given the tremendous energy and resources both firms devote to campus
recruiting and faculty relations.  Faculty members noted that Coopers &
Lybrand, especially, has increased their efforts to court professors.  Coopers
& Lybrand was ranked as the firm with the best relationship with faculty.  As
a whole, the faculty commented that they appreciated Coopers & Lybrand's
recent efforts to keep them apprised of new technical information.

Arthur Andersen was consistently regarded as the firm with the best
relationship with students.  Faculty perceived that the strength of the firm's
relationship with their students was in direct correlation to the high
offer/accept rate among their candidates.  KPMG Peat Marwick's ranking dropped
significantly compared to 1993, a reflection of their recent reduced campus
hirings.

In the categories of "growing its practice" and "technical reputation,"
faculty ranked Arthur Andersen as the top firm.  Some faculty connected the
growth of Andersen Consulting to Arthur Andersen diversifying its practice.
Faculty ranked Ernst & Young second in growing its practice, commenting
favorably on its May 1995 merger with Kenneth Leventhal & Co.  In terms of
technical reputation, Price Waterhouse slipped in overall votes compared to
1993, but still held its second place ranking.

Ranking brands of milk

For the firms that do not have an overwhelming presence or reputation, the
news is somewhat encouraging.  Because the faculty viewed all the Big Six as
reputable operations, they had some difficulty in rating the firms in areas
such as "best demonstrates technical expertise on accounting topics" or
"offers best advancement opportunities."

One professor commented that distinguishing between the firms in these areas
was comparable to "selecting their favorite brand of milk."

In other areas such as "best use of technology," professors felt that they did
not have sufficient information on which to base an opinion.  From the faculty
point of view in these areas, the field is still level and wide open.  For
firms willing to make investments in educating the faculty in these areas,
their reputation on campus may see a considerable jump.

The courtship of faculty is critical to building a firm's reputation and
talent pool for several reasons.  Fostering strong one-on-one relationships
with faculty provides an alternative pathway for firms to communicate with top
students.

Including the faculty in an overall recruiting program provides firms with
additional campus visibility as well as a means to educate faculty about
aspects of their firms.  When approached by students, professors will then be
able to offer valued and well-informed opinions about the career opportunities
available within any particular firm.

Professors with strategic ties to a firm tend to incorporate its data and
research more readily into not only their own personal research, but also
their curriculum.  Classroom exposure brings the firm to life and provides
students - a firm's future managers or potential clients - with in-depth
examples of a firm's capabilities and specializations.

In addition to financially supporting the accounting department, faculty
suggested other key components to building strong faculty relationships.
These include consistently recruiting and retaining their students, providing
technical information to assist in faculty projects, inviting professors to
participate in faculty-only symposiums, sharing leading-edge information and
fostering individual relationships over informal lunches.  Faculty commented
that a closer, working relationship allows for a more thorough flow of company
and recruiting information.

To reap a strategic advantage on campus, Big Six firms need to take an
aggressive approach in their faculty relationships.  Well-planned investments
will, in the long run, be money well spent.  With greater visibility and
reputation on campus, firms will be able to attract their future business
leaders and impress potential future clients.

management consulting firm that specializes in assessment and strategy design
of campus recruiting programs.

HOT TIPS


SO GET SOME NEW MAGAZINES FOR THE WAITING ROOM:  For every complaint a medical
practice receives, 26 others go unreported, Dunbar, Cook & Shepard is telling
clients.

And according to the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, six of those 26
complaints are serious, the Indianapolis firm says.  As if that isn't bad
enough, each of those 26 unhappy patients will complain to about 10 other
potential patients.

TO OUTSOURCE OR NOT TO OUTSOURCE:  While outsourcing may be an easy road to
lower expenses and improved administrative methods, in the long run quality of
work, confidentiality and staff morale may suffer, Duitch, Franklin & Co.  is
warning its law firm clients.

Carefully weigh the benefits against possible drawbacks before deciding
whether to outsource, the Los Angeles firm advises.  Some issues to take into
consideration include:

* Credibility.  Any forthcoming vendor or freelancer will be happy to supply
your firm with references from other clients.  Check them, and talk to other
professionals.  But above all else, trust your instincts, and if you are
uncomfortable with a candidate keep the work in house until you find a
relationship you are comfortable with.  * Contract and pricing.  Make sure
your firm can get out of a contract, especially if the vendor's work is
unsatisfactory.  Review pricing structure - if it seems too good to be true,
it probably is.  * Staff morale.  Taking work away from a staff member simply
because he or she seems overworked may prompt fear rather than relief.  First
talk to the staff to see if any other alternatives may be more appropriate
than outsourcing.  At some firms, legal secretaries and administrative
assistants have banded together to form an "assistant pool" to help out
overworked coworkers in a pinch.  * Confidentiality.  Review your client
roster and caseload, and check off those clients who might object to their
work being outsourced and those matters that are too sensitive for outside
eyes.  * Damage control.  No one source is perfect - consider how well the
firm can rebound should an outside vendor suffer a major equipment or business
failure.  Determine the cost of salvaging an incomplete project.

DON'T TRUST THAT CRAZY UNCLE LOU:  While forming trusts can steer you out of
some sticky financial situations, naming a trustee can be tricky business,
Gikow Bierman & Talesnick is warning clients.  The Roseland, N.J., firm offers
a list of items to consider when choosing a trustee.

* Name more than one trustee, including a professional adviser.  While a
family member or close friend provides sensitivity to the beneficiaries'
needs, the professional adviser can provide financial accountability.  * Don't
word a trust agreement so that an individual trustee doesn't have to retain a
bond.  While waiving a bond may save the trust money, a bond is the only
protection against embezzlement or misuse of funds.  * Name a "trust
protector" - often a family friend - who can discharge a trustee under some
circumstances or veto some of the trustee's decisions.  * Allow for a change
of trustee in case beneficiaries move out of state.  For example, if the
beneficiaries move to a state that does not have income tax, they may still
have to pay state income taxes if the trustee lives in a state with income
tax.  * Write performance guidelines into your trust, allowing beneficiaries
to change trustees if they fail to meet a reasonable performance standard.

CompuServe campaign colors Block 2Q results


KANSAS CITY, MO.  - Marketing and expansion costs contributed to H&R Block
Inc.'s higher than expected loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, on
record revenues of $223.9 million for the second quarter ending Oct.  31,
1995.

That compares to a loss of $1.3 million, or 1 cent a share, on revenues of
$172.9 million for the second quarter ending Oct.  31, 1994.

The company had announced in August 1995 that it had launched a full-throttle
expansion of CompuServe, its computer services subsidiary.

"CompuServe's recent decision to lead the market in offering low-cost Internet
software and access and its agreement to become the exclusive on-line service
outlet for Time magazine are good examples of our aggressive focus," said
Richard H.  Brown, H&R Block Inc.'s president and chief executive officer.
"Our goal is to have nearly 5 million subscribers worldwide by summer."

CompuServe's revenues for the second quarter increased 37.9 percent to a
record $188.4 million, compared to the prior year's second-quarter figures of
$136.6 million.  The division's pretax earnings were $22 million, compared to
$34.3 million for the quarter ending Oct.  31, 1994.

In the second quarter, H&R Block Tax Services reported a pretax loss of $34.4
million, compared to $35.1 million for the quarter ending Oct.  31, 1994.
Revenues declined 0.5 percent to $27.6 million because of decreased enrollment
in the division's tuition tax school.  Brown noted that due to the seasonality
of the tax business, second quarter results are not indicative of the expected
results for the entire fiscal year.

TAXING ISSUES


IRS DISCUSSES LIFE IN A POST-TCMP WORLD:  Lou Carlow, Internal Revenue Service
Assistant Commissioner (Examination) updated a Dec.  5 meeting of the American
Institute of CPA's Tax Division on the IRS' plans for establishing audit
selection criteria in light of the agency's decision to cancel its taxpayer
compliance measurement program audits.  Carlow indicated that the IRS
currently has an internal task force"attempting to come up with a new system."
Meanwhile, Carlow said, the IRS will continue to rely on three sources for
identifying returns for potential audit:(1) existing DIF(discriminate
function) scores- derived from the last TCMP cycle in 1988; (2) information
from district and national office research projects; and (3) its emerging
market segment specialization program activities.


IRS FLIRTS WITH TAXABILITY OF FREQUENT FLYER MILES:  The IRS recently forayed
into the sensitive issue of whether the use of airline frequent flyer miles
consitutes the receipt of taxable income.  In a recent technical advice
memorandum, the IRS concluded that an employer's air travel expense
reimbursement plan didn't qualify as an "accountable plan" because it
affirmatively permitted employees to keep their miles.  Without "accountable
plan" status, expense reimbursements are included in an employee's income,
subject to withholding, and claimed by itemizers on Schedule A as a
miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2 percent floor.  It is worth noting
that the plan in question specifically stated that employees were permitted to
keep the miles they accrued on business travel.  The TAM generated
considerable public and media attention, and subsequent to its release, IRS
commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson is reported to have told a group of
practitioners that the national office currently has no projects in the
"frequent flyer" area.  (TAM 9547001)

401(K) FRAUD TARGETED:  Labor Secretary Robert Reich announced a campaign by
the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration to crack down on fraud in
401(k) plans.  The anti-fraud effort includes both 300 pending investigations
and a consumer education program targeted against employer misuse of 401(k)
funds.  Some of the "10 warning signs" contained in the consumer education
campaign:late 401(k) statements, former employees having trouble getting
benefits paid and contributions held by an employer for more than 90 days.

FINAL PT PREGS ISSUED:  The IRS has released final regulations under Code
Section 7704 applicable to publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) that define
"established securities market" and a "secondary market or its substantial
equivalent."  The regulations also modify and extend existing safe harbors
from PTP treatment.  The final regulations largely follow earlier proposed
ones.  The preamble to the final regulations also indicates that the IRS is
considering guidance on definitions relating to the PTP exception for certain
partnerships with passive income, and has asked for public input on what the
proposed guidance should look like.  (T.D.  8629)

IRS DELAYS '96 WITHHOLDING FORMS:  The IRS has announced that it is delaying
the issuance of the 1996 Form W-4 due to the possibility of tax law changes in
the pending budget bill that may have an impact on an employee's withholding.
The IRS is asking taxpayers to continue using, and employers to continue
accepting, 1995 forms.  The IRS said that it plans to issue new forms as soon
as possible once legislation is finalized.  (Ann.  95-104)

J.D.  Edwards looks to find resellers for Genesis line


DENVER - J.D.  Edwards, which specializes in AS/400 software, has joined the
ranks of companies seeking resellers for its financial line.

Earlier this year the company released Genesis for companies with annual
revenue of $10 million to $100 million.

"It's relatively price competitive with PC-LAN [accounting software]," said
Rick Byrne, director of Genesis operations.

Genesis marks a departure for J.D.  Edwards, which had previously concentrated
on selling enterprise-wide systems on the AS/400.  But it is in line with the
movement of other higher-priced accounting packages into what is referred to
as the middle market.  That market is roughly defined as companies with
revenue of from $10 million to $500 million.

Genesis includes financial, distribution and manufacturing software that can
be sold as a suite.  The manufacturing suite includes distribution and
financials.  Distribution software includes financials.  Byrne said a 20-user
distribution system would cost more than $50,000.

Although many accounting consultants make sales in that price range, many are
not experienced in AS/400 software.  However, there are a few firms which will
be able to play in that arena.

"To play, you've got to have familiarity with that system and have grown up
with the System/34 and 36 world," said Jim Metzler, partner and consultant at
Gaines, Metzler and Kriner, of Buffalo, N.Y.  System/34 and 36 are the older
IBM minicomputers which IBM largely replaced with its AS/400.

Metzler said only a handful of firms do AS/400 consulting, including his.
Metzler's firm also sells the hardware.  He said that the AS/400 is "easier
from a complexity perspective than many networks," but that historical price
points scare away firms.  He views the AS/400 as more cost-effective than
PC-LAN networks, especially for "clients who need multi-tasking and minimal
care and feeding."

Metzler's firm resells and installs software from Daily & Wolcott, a
competitor of J.D.  Edwards.

Genesis supports Windows clients and is Windows 95 compliant, Byrne said.  The
software will operate in both PC and terminal environments.

More recently, J.D.  Edwards introduced the OneWorld line, a follow-up to its
World software.  OneWorld is a client/server package, which expands support of
hardware to work stations running Microsoft NT Server.

More expensive than Genesis, OneWorld is likely to be streamlined in the next
year to 18 months for a version that will also be available to resellers.

With more low-end releases, vendors eye reseller programs


Santa Claus left a bundle of new low-end accounting software packages under
the tree and visions of new programs for accountants danced in vendors' heads
through the New Year.

In time to welcome 1996, Intuit, Peachtree, BestWare, New England Business
Service, Computer Associates and DacEasy all introduced new versions of their
small business accounting packages.

And those vendors who don't actively recruit CPA firms as resellers or
recommenders were eyeing how to structure programs in order to involve firms.

"We're working on a formal recommender program," said Drew Paxton, Intuit's
International Project Manager, Business Products Group.

Similarly, David Dalton, director of marketing for 4Home Productions, said his
company will investigate a CPA program for its Simply Money.

It's very clear what's at stake.  As NEBS introduced its One-Write Plus
Version 5.0 for Windows, it said that 50 percent of One-Write users say an
accountant recommended the purchase.  One-Write has been particularly strong
in this group in supporting a consulting program.

BestWare of Rockaway, N.J., already had an active channel program for its
M.Y.O.B.  Accounting software, but recently appointed its first Consultant
Program manager.  DacEasy has about 300 certified consultants, many of whom
resell.

Rob Hartlage, a CPA who operates Asystants, a Sellersburg, Ind.-based
consulting firm, said many accountants don't understand the opportunities
low-end consulting offers.

"They [accountants] wonder why someone would pay $99 for a package and then
spend $500 to $1,000 to help use it," said Hartlage.  "They will."

Hartlage consults for DacEasy software and does some limited work with Quicken
and One-Write Plus.  He said despite all the effort to make accounting
software easier to use, clients need someone to help them get started.

Paxton's comments came as Intuit introduced new versions of its line with
QuickBooks 4.0 and QuickBooks Pro 4.0.  There's one change, though- Intuit has
dropped its claim that QuickBooks is bookkeeping software and now aggressively
touts it as accounting software.

Although Intuit claims more accountants recommend QuickBooks than any other
software, the company has not formally enrolled firms in the process.

That's likely to change.  Intuit has already established its Intuit Financial
Partner Program, which seeks to give referrals to CPAs.  The first year was a
bit slim:  10,000 firms signed up, but Intuit only got 7,000 referrals.  The
company hopes to triple referrals this year.

4Home Productions, the small-business, consumer software arm of Computer
Associates, is also looking at establishing a consulting or recommender
program or both, according to David Dalton, director of marketing.

Low-end accounting software is getting more robust, particularly more
customizable, and supposedly easier to use.  But forays into vertical markets
by these vendors may offer accountants more chances to develop consulting
opportunities.

Most of these products allow the user to modify fields in reports or entry
screens or both and to pick from sample charts of accountants from differing
types of businesses, which can be used as templates.  Particularly popular is
the ability to reorder or hide fields.

Drag and drop editing of fields is increasingly popular.  Simply Accounting
for Windows 4.0 from 4Home productions use drag and drop on the home screen.
M.Y.O.B.  6.0 from BestWare supports drag and drop modification of report
fields while DacEasy Accounting & Payroll 95 offers the capability for forms.

This is one of the few areas where the competitors are ahead of QuickBooks,
which requires the use of a dialogue box to rename fields.

Easier setup is also a common goal.  With the Windows version of One-Write
Plus, users set up companies through an interview process.  Intuit of Menlo
Park, Calif.  also has adopted the interview form with QuickBooks and
QuickBooks Pro, while Peachtree Software of Norcross, Ga., carried the
interview setup into the world of multimedia with video and audio clips.
BestWare has used the interview approach since version 4.0 of M.Y.O.B.

In DacEasy Accounting & Payroll 95, DacEasy of Dallas, takes a page from
Windows in offering the Easy Setup Wizard.

QuickBooks Pro is trying to claim unique customization abilities to allow
users to tailor documentation and features for more than 20 different
industries.

Users, said Paxton, "are looking for something that can be made specific to
their businesses."  While other packages provide charts of accounts that can
be used as templates, QuickBooks offers custom documentation for niches, such
as construction.

To a certain extent, 4Home is simply trying to keep pace.  Dalton admitted his
company fell behind its development cycle.  But he added, "I think we'll come
back strong."

Simply Accounting adds the ability to store both prior and current year's
fiscal data and print comparative financial reports.

Besides its customization features and set-up interview, Nebs expanded on-line
help and provided expert definitions of financial and accounting concepts.

DacEasy lays claim to being the first of the group to design its system for
Windows 95.  It offers 100 business templates and offers report customization
through a Report Wizard.  Like QuickBooks, the latest DacEasy software also
includes time and billing and contact management features.

M.Y.O.B.'s report customization is similar in offering more than 100 templates
and enabling drill-down analysis.  It provides time and billing information
less directly, offering the Timeslips Accounting link to pull time and billing
data from Timeslips.  M.Y.O.B.  has also added the ability to import data from
Quicken.

ACTION IDEA:  How to have a successful seminar


Even if you've managed to attract half the business community to your seminar,
your efforts are far from finished.  Not only do you want the attendees to
enjoy the session, but enjoy it enough to attend another one.  Here are some
tips:

* The place - The room should have no distracting elements, and should
accommodate your guests when seated as well as gathered on breaks.  Arrange
seating so attendees participate.  Lighting must be adequate.  Offer
refreshments.  * The program - Distribute handouts so the audience can follow
along.  Humor goes a long way toward holding interest; so does audience
interaction.  Schedule regular breaks, about every 45 minutes.  * The follow
up - Distribute and collect evaluation forms, and respond personally to any
extremely positive or negative evaluations.  Make sure all attendees in your
marketing database receive firm correspondence.

Budget worries kill workload relief bill


WASHINGTON - The chance that workload compression relief will come to small
CPA firms soon is slim.

A provision that would have allowed partnerships and S corporations to choose
their own fiscal year didn't survive the final conference budget bill Congress
handed to President Clinton.

"It was a major disappointment," said Gerald W.  Padwe, vice president of tax
for the American Institute of CPAs.

The AICPA had been the major backer of the provision, which would have allowed
the pass-through entities to make quarterly estimated tax payments on behalf
of their owners.  The owners would be relieved of quarterly payments if their
companies paid for them.

While the proposal was included in the House of Representatives version of the
budget, its price tag probably forced it to be dropped during conference bill
discussion.  According to Padwe, the AICPA was told the provision would have
cost $335 million through five years.  Another estimate quoted by Lindy Paull,
majority staff director of the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill would
cost $355 million over seven years.

Either way, it's not a phenomenal total when you consider the size of the
budget.  But it was worth enough to be used as part of the budget bargaining
bonanza.  Padwe speculated that the provision was axed when Rep.  Bill Archer,
R-Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had to find ways to pay
for making the proposed capital gains tax cut retroactive to Jan.  1, 1995.

Rep.  E.  Clay Shaw, R-Fla., the original sponsor of the provision, has told
AICPA leaders he'll try to get the proposal reinstated if they can devise a
way to make the workload compression plan revenue neutral.  Padwe, however,
takes a fatalist's view on Shaw's chances.

"We would love to see it come back," Padwe said, "but as a practical matter,
they say when something has fallen out of a bill it's hard to get it back in."

Although the AICPA's outside economist projected that the workload compression
proposal wouldn't drain tax dollars from the system, the Joint Tax Committee's
prognosticators came up with the $355 million mark.  The reason?  According to
the terms of the current provision, the quarterly estimated tax payments would
be made at the 34 percent level.  If a taxpayer owns all the shares of an S
corporation and is in the 31 percent bracket, why would he want to make the
payments?  On the other hand, if the same taxpayer were in the 39.6 percent
bracket, he would be more than happy to pay the 34 percent.

"He'd say, 'I'm getting the use of that money until next April,'" Padwe said.

That's what ends up costing the government those millions.  (The AICPA is now
proposing to increase the tax to 35 percent.)

Padwe still hasn't given up hope.  This year the 104th Congress is still in
control, so the AICPA doesn't need to find another champion for the bill.
Unfortunately a presidential election year isn't the best time to find a tax
bill, which is the typical vehicle to attach this provision to.

"It's not a bill you'd expect to stand alone," Padwe said.  "It's going to be
hard to find 500 congressmen to say, 'This is the most exciting thing I've
ever seen.  Quick, let's pass it.'"

Congress passes tort reform bill with veto override


WASHINGTON -- Much to the relief of the American Institute of CPAs, Congress
voted to overturn President Clinton's veto of securities litigation reform.

The president had vetoed the legislation, which shields independent
accountants from abusive liability damage awards.  The veto shocked bill
supporters, including the AICPA.

The bill sailed through Congress last month as the House and Senate raced to
adjourn the 1995 legislative session.  Final passage of the bill - a top
lobbying priority for the Big Six accounting firms during each of the past two
Congresses - was "testament to the widely held belief that the tide of
frivolous securities litigation in this country must be stopped," AICPA
officials said.

A key provision of the bill for the accounting profession places new
restrictions on the ability of plaintiffs to use the "joint and several"
standard of liability for extracting huge damage awards from CPAs when other
defendants in the case are unable to pay their portion of the damages.

Instead, the legislation establishes a system of "proportionate liability"
under which accountants and other peripheral defendants will be expected to
pay only their fair share of a judgment.

That proportionate liability shield isn't completely bullet-proof, however.
Small investors will continue to be allowed to sue based on the "joint and
several" liability standard, and accountants who knowingly participate in a
securities fraud will remain subject to full "joint and several" liability.

Additionally, even in the proportionate liability cases, CPAs would be
required to pay up to 150 percent of their proportionate share of damages when
another defendant is insolvent.

At the same time, the legislation also contains a number of provisions to
ensure that accountants and other business advisers are held accountable in
cases where they knowingly permit their clients to engage in securities fraud.

The final version passed by Congress amends portions of the U.S.  Supreme
Court's controversial 1994 Central Bank decision to restore Securities and
Exchange Commission authority to bring "aiding and abetting" cases against
CPAs for knowingly violating federal securities law.

A separate provision of the bill codifies a key recommendation by
investigators of the savings and loan crisis that would require outside
auditors to disclose suspected client fraud to the appropriate enforcement
agency.

For his part, AICPA President Barry Melancon called the final bill "a fair
balance between the rights of truly defrauded investors and those start-up
companies and outside professionals who have become victims of a small group
of entrepreneurial lawyers abusing the legal system."

Passage of the legislation drew a sharply different reaction from critics of
litigation reform.

Consumer Federation of America Chairman Howard Metzenbaum attacked
congressional supporters of the bill for "carrying the ball for some very
special interests who only have a selfish financial interest to protect.

"The securities industry, accountants and corporate insiders are far less in
need of protection than is the small investor in the marketplace," he said.

In contrast, congressional advocates of the litigation reform measure
contended that the legislation would have increased investor control of class
action securities suits "so that settlements benefit the plaintiffs and not
just the plaintiffs' attorneys."

According to representatives of Sen.  Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the bill's
chief sponsor, under the current system "investors generally receive only 7 to
14 cents per dollar of loss, and only after the plaintiffs attorneys take
their fee off the top."

To address this problem, the bill eliminates the "lodestar" approach to
calculating fees, under which "attorneys get to skim right off the top of a
settlement award," they said.  Instead, lawyers will be allowed to pocket only
"a reasonable percentage of the award they obtain for their clients."

In addition, the legislation includes provisions to:

* create a uniform pleading standard by adopting guidelines established by the
U.S.  Second Circuit Court of Appeals; * restrict the use of "professional
plaintiffs" in class action securities lawsuits; * require more complete
disclosure of settlement arrangements to enable plaintiffs in class action
suits to make informed decisions about attorney's fees; and * encourage more
meaningful corporate financial projections by establishing a new SEC-supported
"safe harbor" for forward looking financial statements.

TAX PRACTICE:  Former Navy CPO sails into friendly tax prep waters


RICHMOND, VA.  - Rob Stepp went from looking for submarines to searching for
tax deductions.

The former Navy chief petty officer bought one Jackson Hewitt Tax Services
franchise and purchased the rights to open four more offices in the Richmond
area five years ago.  He's also planning to open a kiosk at his local Wal-Mart
this tax season and to add two more storefronts by next tax season.

After a decade in the Navy as a sonar technician, Stepp found that his
enthusiasm for accounting hadn't waned.

"All my life, I've loved numbers," Stepp said.  "Math was my favorite subject
in school.  I never used a calculator."

Stepp was still in the Navy, stationed in Virginia Beach, Va., when he was
inducted into the Jackson Hewitt system.  Because he received computer
training in the military, a friend in town asked if Stepp could help iron out
a few technology bugs at her tax practice.  His assignment was supposed to
last a few days, but ended up growing into a part-time job.

Stepp caught tax preparation fever, which led him and his wife, Helen, to
acquire the existing Richmond office and open four new locations in nearby
neighborhoods.

"We wanted these surrounding territories because they had no competition for
years," Stepp said.  "There were only H&R Block, CPAs and accountants.  The
average taxpayer doesn't need a CPA or accountant to do his taxes."

But the Navy didn't equip Stepp with the practical skills needed to run a
business.

"You get into the military and you've got a sure paycheck," Stepp noted.  "You
won't get laid off.  The biggest thing you have to do is show up."

The hardest part was hiring a staff, Stepp recalled.  Finding qualified
candidates and going through the interview process was a chore.  And
determining a salary scale was a nightmare.

"If they had experience working at H&R Block, it wasn't fair to pay them
beginners' wages," Stepp said.  "In the military you don't have that.  You're
paid according to your rank."

The first months were tough.  At the time, some of Stepp's more than 60
employees had a lot of experience, some had "just basic training" and some had
tax knowledge, but no computer training.

"It was quite a year," Stepp said of his May 1991 to early 1992 adventure.
"I'm glad it's over."

In retrospect, Stepp said he should have taken more time to expand his
business, which now employs 90 workers in tax season and eight after May 15.
Stepp's offices handled 5,800 clients during the 1995 tax season.

His advice to first-time business owners:  Find someone experienced who can
work as an assistant.  He also suggests that novice business owners advertise
in their local newspaper.

Stepp credits his practice's success - he won Jackson Hewitt's annual customer
service award - to the cheerful atmosphere in his offices.

"We hire happy, upbeat receptionists," he said.  "If you get a bad reception,
you can forget about seeing that client."

In the interest of customer satisfaction, Stepp and his staff spent last
summer calling all their clients to ask if they had any problems with the
practice's service during the 1995 tax season.  Nationwide, taxpayers suffered
through refund delays because of fraud checks involving the earned income tax
credit and Social Security numbers.

Those who said they had a problem were asked for suggestions on how the
service could be improved.  The clients also received a certificate for the
free preparation of one tax return.

"People were angry at all tax preparers," Stepp said about the 1995 tax
season.  "Once they found out that we didn't know that the Internal Revenue
Service kept these procedures under wraps, they were OK.  Their biggest
complaint is, 'I want a bigger refund.'" Even the Navy couldn't help customers
with that one.

Dealing with customers also was new territory for Stepp to explore when he
left the Navy.  And while he succeeded in civilian life, Stepp concedes that
it's not always easy for those leaving the military to find a fulfilling
second career.

"The real work is difficult to handle," Stepp said.  "In the Navy, someone was
always there to tell you what to do."


Editorial:Flunking the test

The CPA exam needs reform

The night before accounting school grads take the CPA exam, they should pray
for one of two things:  acute accounting knowledge or the luck to take the
test with a pack of boneheads.

Either way, they'll do fine.  That's because the American Institute of CPAs,
which administers the Uniform CPA Examination, uses a quota system to rate CPA
candidates.  First, those scoring 75 percent correctly on the test are
automatically in the CPA club.  But, if those scoring 75 and above are not
equal to 30 percent of the test takers, grades often in the 60s are simply
rounded up to 75 to meet the 30 percent quota.

It sounds like a strange way to introduce a new crop of young adults into a
profession that prides itself on precision and integrity.  The exact mechanics
of it all even escapes the comprehension of two out of three state regulators
surveyed by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy.

But the results of the May 1995 exam have sent the issue to the front and
center for many state regulators.  In last spring's exam, grades were adjusted
to make 62 the pass point on two sections of the test, but no adjustments were
made for candidates who scored less than 75 on two others.  By one estimate,
6,000 of the 61,650 candidates who might have passed the test were flunked so
the AICPA could make its 30 percent target.

The South Dakota board complained that it is only a matter of time before a
legal challenge is made to this procedure.  The board is right.  It would be
tough to explain to a candidate that he or she flunked just because he or she
is smarter than only 69 percent of those taking the test.

It's time that NASBA and the AICPA put an end to the quota system.  Both
groups should work together to create a new system involving, first, a test
that reliably measures proficiency year after year, and second, a definitive
passing score that requires no curving to meet an arbitrary, monopoly-imposed
quota.

Every candidate must be assured of a fair test.


LETTERS FROM EXAM CANDIDATES:

Exam results 'tough to swallow'

Thank you for the shocking revelation about the CPA exam ("Fight over CPA exam
tests the testers," Nov.  20-Dec.  10, 1995).  I was greatly disturbed and
deeply saddened after reading your report, because I could have been one of
the 6,000 candidates who otherwise would have passed the test with grade
adjustment.  I scored 67 on the May 1995 Financial Accounting Section - my
last paper to pass, on which, according to your report, 66 was the passing
point after grade adjustment.

Despite the fact that I hit 68 a few times in other papers, I never questioned
the grading system.  I forced myself to admit that somebody did better than I,
therefore, I did not deserve to pass and had to study harder.

The May 1995 result was very tough to swallow, even more so after I read your
article last night.  I feel most sorry for my wife and two children, for all
the sacrifices, understanding and encouragement they put in for me.

David P.  Sin Scarborough, Ontario


I was a November 1995 candidate for the Uniform CPA Examination.

This was my ninth time taking the exam due to the fact that I have been out of
college for more than 10 years.  However, through studying for and by retaking
the exam, my scores have shown a certain degree of improvement toward the 75
percent passing score.

My reason for contacting you is that I have become very concerned about the
grading process which is used to determine the actual percentage that is
deemed passing or failing on the exam and how that percentage is determined.

Most CPA review course admininstrators tell their students that a 67 through
69 score is graded upward to a passing 75 percent, yet, on the May 1995 exam,
I received a score of 69 on the Business Law section.

In a recent special report in Accounting Today, (Fight over CPA exam tests the
testers," Nov.  20-Dec.  10, 1995) the following points were brought to my
attention as a CPA exam candidate:

* It is stated that "if less than 30 percent of the candidates score 75
percent, the failing grades are curved upward to assure that at least 30
percent pass."  * A 65 might be a passing grade in one year but not in the
next.  * On the 1993 exam, candidates answering only 65 percent of the
questions correctly on the Accounting Theory exam were given grades which were
curved upward to a passing 75 percent.  * On the 1992 exam, a 52 score was
curved upward to a passing 75 percent.  * On the May 1995 exam the grades were
adjusted to a make the passing grades 62 on the Accounting and Reporting
sections and 66 on the Business Law and Auditing Sections.  Thirty-five
percent were allowed to pass on this exam.

With reference to this article, on the May 1992 exam, I scored over 52 on
three sections of the exam.

I would like to know what criteria is used to determine which candidates are
to be included in the 30 or 35 percent passing rate and how the subjects in
which they are allowed to pass are determined.

I have become very concerned about the grading procedures due to the fact that
my grades have only increased by a very small margin in six of the nine times
in which I have taken the exam.  In at least three instances, my grades were
almost exactly the same.  I was a little concerned at this point.

After receiving my scores for the May 1995 exam, and also after reading the
article, I became very disturbed that only a percentage of candidates are
allowed to pass the exam, even if a 69 through 74 score is obtained.  I am
sure this is also very disturbing to other candidates who have scored in this
range.

What is even more alarming is that no one knows how, in any given year, the
pass point is determined.  Personally, it makes me feel as though I am
shooting in the dark, yet never hitting anything.

As important as this exam is to accountants and to entry into the profession,
I feel that as a CPA candidate and, certainly, one who has studied in order to
master this area of learning, there needs to be a better understanding of the
grading system which is used to determine our career paths.

Study finds employers liable for $95B error on non-exempt employees


WASHINGTON - A new study suggests that the potential annual private sector
overtime liability for misclassification of exempt status under the Fair Labor
Standards Act is $1.8 billion per week, or $95 billion annually.

The Employment Policy Foundation's study is based on Census Bureau wage and
hour data and assumes that all white collar employees now classified as exempt
were in fact non-exempt.

Kenneth L.  Deavers, the author of the study and the conservative group's
chief economist, notes that such an outcome might be considered to be extreme,
"but was seriously considered by the Minimum Wage Study Commission in its 1981
report."

In a more immediate and consequential sense, the study shows that potential
employer liability for overtime pay could be substantial, the group said.

Because employers found to have misclassified non-exempt employees as exempt
are liable for two years back pay under the FLSA, the liability for back pay
could be $1.9 billion for each 1 percent of the white collar workforce found
to be non-exempt.  And, if the violations were found to be willful, the back
pay liability extends to three years and the award is doubled.

Deavers describes the existing Department of Labor definitions and tests for
determining exempt status as "so arcane and subjective they lend themselves to
employer misunderstanding and possible administrative manipulation."

Deavers goes on to say that "if firms incorrectly categorize employees as
exempt, or in some other way disqualify employees from exemption, they are
liable for back pay for overtime and, in some cases, punitive damages.  It is
these potential costs that motivate firms to push for clear-cut rules
determining exempt status under the FLSA."

"The definitions used to determine who is an exempt employee have not changed
for nearly 50 years, despite the revolutionary changes in the workplace,"
according to Edward Potter, the group's president.  "Under the present system
of subjective definitions, an employer never knows whether it has properly
classified employees until after an administrative review lawsuit.  Clearly,
the FLSA exemption should reflect the characteristics of modern-day work:
increasingly knowledge based, requiring independent judgment on the part of
the workers."

AICPA, AT&T cite businesses


DETROIT - The American Institute of CPAs and AT&T Capital have awarded $50,000
in grants to three local entrepreneurs to help finance their businesses.

The Partners for Growth grants were given to a new basketball facility for
inner-city teenagers, the owner of a bookstore and coffee house dedicated to
increasing cultural awareness within the African-American community, and to
the president of a minority-owned environmental chemistry consulting firm.

Partners for Growth, which began in 1994 as a pilot program in Houston and
Philadelphia, provides financial assistance to new businesses that demonstrate
a positive social impact.

Expect the unexpected:  Trends to watch


Hang on.  1996 is going to be bumpy ride.  Start with a late-to-press tax code
and finish with a presidential election.  In between, add management-by-chaos
at the American Institute of CPAs and wild card court decisions on CPA
regulation.  And 1996 is sure to be wild and unpredictable.

But that hasn't deterred Accounting Today's fearless prognosticators.  Here
then are the top trends to watch in 1996:

Inroads by non-CPAs:  Four of the top 10 fastest-growing tax and accounting
firms are hardly your traditional, CPA-owned businesses.  They include
franchises like Jackson Hewitt or conglomerates like American Express.  Even
CPA insiders say the days of CPA-owned monopolies are numbered.

But beyond direct threats, look for new competition from unexpected sources:
Baby Bells are offering start-up business services.  Consumers and small
business are buying new business and accounting software at a blistering pace.
Bankers are end-running accountants with consumer-like matrices for business
loans and on-line record keeping services.

CPE gets a makeover:  Some leaders of the profession are openly questioning
the value and purpose of mandated continuing professional education.  But more
important, computer-based training using multimedia programs, on-line chat
sessions and just-in-time delivery could radically reshape how CPAs choose,
use and pay for CPE.  Some of the products that will point the way are
scheduled for 1996.

Tax system overhaul:  If the flat tax started to loom seriously for the first
time in 1995, then the 1996 presidential election year seems sure to keep it
alive.  No matter who's elected, the next president will have run on a
platform of tax reform.

CPA advertising:  With the American Institute of CPA's $10 million ad
campaign, even tradition-bound, rank-and-file local CPA firms are testing the
media waters for the first time.

AICPA/state society coordination:  Under attack to consolidate services and
cut duplicative costs, AICPA chief executive Barry Melancon is leading a drive
for the profession's trade groups to end hostile rivalries.  Look for advances
in CPE and health insurance.

Value billing:  With clients becoming increasingly cost conscious and
technology reshaping the underlying economics of traditional hourly billing,
tax and accounting practitioners are increasingly turning to alternative
pricing policies, for instance:  Tax prep priced by the form, consulting
engagements priced by the percentage of savings, standard accounting services
priced as part of a bundle of products.  Hot books on the subject:  Last
year's "Innovative Billing and Collection Methods That Work" by Charles and
Joseph Larson, published by Irwin Professional Publishing; this year's
"Breaking the Paradigm" by August Aquila, from the AICPA.

New work place solutions:  In this new era of diminished expectations, a new
generation of professional is striking a fresh balance between career and
personal fulfillment.  Large firms like Ernst & Young are 'hoteling' staffers
- providing home office workspace only when needed.  Midsized firm Clifton
Gunderson is offering partner-level flextime.  Local firms are going virtual -
like CPA Janet Caswell in Bloomfield, Mich., who sent her staffers to work at
home with laptops, e-mail systems and an 800 phone number.

Trade show power shift:  The AICPA and state societies have long held a lock
on the pace-setting conferences in the CPA business.  But declining attendance
revenue and increasing vendor competition are adding a new element of
commercialization to the conference schedule.  As the accounting profession
gets increasingly technology-driven, watch for technology vendors to take more
active and visible roles.  For instance:  This year the AICPA will launch the
Practitioner's Symposium, consolidating three old conferences and making
vendors an integral part.  The National Society of Public Accountants is
considering a technology show.  Microsoft is investigating a number of ways of
establishing its own conference presence.  And Tom Davis, a CPA consultant and
Accounting Today software reviewer, is planning a software show for Amelia
Island, Ga.  The SoftEx show, long aimed at big companies, will be adding a
small-business focus this year.

Consulting takes the driver's seat:  After a year of tremendous double-digit
percentage gains in management advisory services, consulting has clearly
emerged as the driving force at the Big Six.  Ernst & Young could be garnering
half its fees from consulting by 1999.

Financial planning:  With tax work becoming more of a commodity and
marginalized, an increasing number of tax professionals are turning to
personal financial planning.  Membership in the AICPA's financial planning
division has surged with the recognition of the rival certified financial
planner designation.  The number of registered advisers is booming.  And with
a flat tax, planning could be all that's left.

Outsourcing:  Re-engineering and rightsizing are driving staff and
administrative functions into the waiting arms of accountants and business
advisors.  Over the next three years, outsourced assignments could jump from
26 percent of the world's 300 largest corporations to 42 percent, according to
Arthur Andersen, one of the most aggressive information technology providers.
Even the level of controversial internal audit outsourcing could more than
double.

CPA firm diversification:  KPMG Peat Marwick's creation of Baymark, a captive
investment bank, was just the tip of the iceberg as firms grapple for new
sources of income.  Ernst & Young is aiming to become a major player in
hospital administration.

Related trend - Expansion goes vertical:  Firms are acquiring skills and
practices in strategically important niches.  Among smaller firms, for
example, Yergen & Meyer in Portland, Ore., has acquired TGS, a local boutique
firm with Pacific Rim connections.

IRS hunkers down:  With much of the momentum for a flat tax fueled by simple
hatred at the IRS, the agency can be expected to pull in its horns.  Without
the taxpayer compliance measurement project, for example, watch for the IRS to
pick new audit targets using computerized statistical techniques.

Related trend - Go ELF yourself:  By going on-line as much as possible, the
IRS could soon be circumventing established electronic filing services.

Non-financial performance measures:  With the traditional audit in decline,
expect a slew of ideas for providing new assurance services.  KPMG Peat
Marwick is rolling out its Business Measurement Process to augment the audit.
The AICPA has a committee developing more.

Related trend 1 - CPAs create new system of product development:  But even
more important, the profession could be forging a totally new system of
creating CPA-only services.  Instead of writing cookbooks detailing every step
of the new process, standard-setters might only mandate results, leaving the
methodologies to innovators in the CPA marketplace.

Related trend 2 - Plain-paper financial statements:  Whether the AICPA
approves so-called assembly statements or not, clearly many CPAs believe
small-business clients are clamoring for simplified reports.  Watch for CPAs
to find products to compete with low-end or non-CPA competitors.

Windows sets the standard:  Although the accounting market may lag behind the
rest of the world, it is inevitable that Microsoft's Windows will become the
standard software platform.  The expenses of rewriting DOS software could
drive many smaller software vendors out of the business.

Related trend - Intuit, armed with TurboTax, becomes a standard of its own in
electronic commerce.

THE BEST OF FOOTNOTES 1995


BARRY WHO?  - "Barry Melancon, please," said the caller to the American
Institute of CPA's New York office.

"Who?"  asked the receptionist.  "I'm sorry, I don't have that name in the
directory."

"But he's the new president of the AICPA," the caller said.

"Oh, you mean Me-lahn-KON?  He won't really be here until, like, July."

"Ok, thank you.  I guess I'll try him in Louisiana."


TV NEWS SHREDS CPAS BECAUSE CPAS DIDN'T - A bevy of Chicago accountants were
caught red-faced on the 11 o'clock news for failing to shred many confidential
client documents before trashing them.

A local television station news crew from WMAQ unearthed all sorts of
interesting records by going through the dumpsters of major CPA firms and
financial institutions.

Unused checkbooks, bank statements and tax returns were just a few of the
items dug up.


WE WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT WITH A 10-FOOT POLL - San Diego CPAs felt the bite of
American Express Tax & Business Services after sending a survey to members of
the local chapter of the California Society of CPAs.

The survey asked if CPAs thought American Express reps were "snakes in the
grass who have no business being a part of our meetings."  AmEx didn't take
too kindly to being compared to reptiles.  "To be referred to as snakes seems
mean-spirited at best and defamatory at worst," wrote AmEx counsel Sarah
McKenzie to San Diego chapter president Doug Obenshain.  Obenshain apologized,
but that wasn't good enough for McKenzie, who requested he either retract the
comments or publish his letter of apology in the next chapter newsletter.


I JUST WANNA SHOP - All it took was a Hindu monk and a good accountant to
straighten out the Yin and Yang of singer Gino Vanelli's life.

Vanelli became an overnight sensation in 1978 when his hit record "I Just
Wanna Stop" sold a million copies, making him a multimillionaire.

But apparently a million dollars doesn't go as far as it used to, and Vanelli
quickly racked up quite a debt, supporting friends and relatives and buying
new homes.

Vanelli began a spiritual journey, seeking direction from a world of
philosophies.  He spoke with Benedictine monks in Big Sur, Calif., Inca
priests in Peru and Zen priests in Japan, finally meeting a Hindu monk near
Malibu, Calif.

The monk closed his eyes, opened them and gazed far into the sky.  After a
moment of silence he said the words that would bring about Vanelli's financial
salvation:  "What you really need is a good accountant."


LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF LAWSUITS - Paramount Pictures Corp.  has resolved its
financial differences with "Forrest Gump" author Winston Groom.

The studio had claimed it hasn't cleared any "net profits" for the blockbuster
movie, and gave Groom only $250,000 for his work.  The movie reportedly
grossed $341 million in the United States.

The settlement came soon after Groom retained attorney Pierce O'Donnel, the
same lawyer who represented writer Art Buchwald in a similar dispute against
Paramount regarding the Eddie Murphy movie "Coming to America."

In addition, Paramount agreed to buy the sequel.  This time Groom got an
undisclosed seven-figure sum.


FROM THE HOME OFFICE - Concerned about his viewers' finances, CBS "Late Show"
host David Letterman offered a few signs that you've hired a bad accountant.
Among them were:

* You hear him on the phone saying, "Have I ever let you down, Leona?"  * His
"short form" looks suspiciously like a cocktail napkin.  * He used to be some
kind of financial big shot in Orange County.

Rogue AAA 'Club' demands change


SARASOTA, FLA.  - A small but influential group within the American Accounting
Association has officially challenged the governance of the organization,
claiming unfair representation and poor management.

Informally calling themselves "The Reform Club," the disgruntled college and
university faculty have gained enough support to propose three
near-revolutionary bylaw changes and bring them to a vote before the
membership of less than 10,000.

Although even the reformers doubt they'll win, the battle is rocking an
otherwise staid association of college and university faculty.  It is also
posing a first challenge to new executive director Craig Polhemus.  He took
over from Paul Gerhardt, who retired after two decades of service last summer.

The proposals would open up the executive committee to a broader nominating
process, encourage the proliferation of sections within the organization, and
allow members to receive one of the section journals as part of membership
dues.

Critics of The Reform Club reject the charge that the organization is
undemocratic or that its highest echelons are closed to small-school faculty.
They criticize the club's proposals as vague, with the potential to fragment
the association.

Describing the AAA's executive committee as dominated by 10 or 12 doctoral
degree-granting schools, Paul Williams, a professor at North Carolina State
University, said the panel has ignored member needs.

"Most members are at schools like N.C.  State, and the AAA is not responsive
to the types of problems we encounter," Williams says.  "Our primary job is to
teach and only in the last couple of years have we had a teaching section.


'The Reform Club' agenda

1.  Open ruling executive committee to nominations.  2.  Foster new and
smaller special-interest sections.  3.  Impose market discipline on journal
publishing.

Get real, AICPA tells flat taxers


by Sandy Hock


CORONADO, CALIF.  - As an American Institute of CPAs committee prepares to
release a 225-page report on alternative income tax systems, the committee's
chair challenged those touting reform to get real.

"You're dealing with theoretical rhetoric and missing the realities that we
accountants tend to revel in," said Byrle M.  Abbin, chair of the AICPA's
consumption tax task force.

Economists from all sides "are so far apart that I don't trust either end of
the spectrum," Abbin, a retired partner from Arthur Andersen & Co., told the
420 conferees at the AICPA Fall Tax Division meeting here last month.

Abbin's committee report, scheduled to be released this week, is not intended
to be a policy statement on each reform proposal.  Abbin said, however, that
the AICPA doubts that substituting a flat tax, the most talked about tax
reform proposition, would "appreciably simplify" the system for many
taxpayers.

Since 70 percent of individual filers use the standard deductions, Abbin wrote
in the back-up material provided for the conference, the loss of itemized
deductions does not change their situation.

Further, whether standard or itemized deductions are used, any individual with
taxable income of less than $100,000 can get his or her tax liability from
Form 1040 instructions.

"For them, the effect is the same as having one flat rate, at least with
regard to the complexity of calculating the tax," Abbin wrote.

And the flat tax was just one of the areas touched on when Abbin moderated an
alternative tax panel discussion that featured a member of former Republican
Congressman Jack Kemp's Tax Reform Commission and a Democrat offering the
party's response to the commission's work.

Speaking for the Kemp commission, Loretta H.  Adams, a San Diego business
owner, said the current level of tax complexity "is more than just a hassle
and drag on the economy."  In fact, Adams said U.S.  companies spent $127
billion and individuals spent another $65 billion complying with tax laws.
Losing that $192 billion to tax compliance and preparation is the equivalent
of "taking General Motors' output and dumping it in the ocean."

After attending public hearings in eight cities and hearing from 125
witnesses, the Kemp panel came away with one message:  The current tax system
should be replaced.  The commission drew up six principles tax reform should
promote:  simplicity, stability, neutrality, visibility, economic growth and
fairness; taxes shouldn't be hidden.

While Adams said the Kemp committee will release its report early this year,
John Buckley, the minority chief tax counsel for the House Ways and Means
Committee, is already speculating that the commission will back a flat tax.

"It may be the flat tax as proposed by [Rep.  Dick] Armey would be what is
recommended," Buckley said.  "If it is, I think I can say the Democrats will
oppose it."

In short, Armey, a Texas Republican, calls for a flat tax rate of from 17 to
20 percent.  It's known as the proposal that will allow taxpayers to file
their returns on a postcard.

Buckley argued that calling the Armey plan a flat tax is "misleading."  For
individuals, the flat income tax would be levied on wages and retirement
distributions.  Dividends, on the other hand, would be exempt.

"There would be a substantial shift of tax burden down the income scale,"
Buckley maintained.

A flat tax would repeal the earned income tax credit, which would contribute
to increasing taxes on the lowest 20 percent of working Americans, he added.

Self-employed individuals would not be entitled to a standard deduction so
they would be paying the 17 to 20 percent rate "from dollar one," Buckley
said.  And since the Armey plan would allow employers to deduct wages, but not
employees' fringe benefits, it would give companies an incentive to drop
health insurance in favor of salary increases.

In addressing the other tax proposals bandied about, such as the national
retail sales tax plan endorsed by Sen.  Richard G.  Lugar, R-Ind., Buckley was
equally lukewarm.

"Retail taxes are a small part of the economy," he said.  And only three
states have tried to tax services, which is a large segment of the economy, he
added.

Abbin gave a thumbnail sketch of each of the major tax proposals.  He
explained that the plan furthest along in the thought process is the unlimited
savings allowance proposed by Sens.  Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.  That bipartisan plan favors savings and taxes consumption.  Armey's
proposal is a five-page bill that extracts certain segments of the Internal
Revenue Code, Abbin said.

"It leaves a lot of questions," he added.

And all that is concrete about the plans of Rep.  Bill Archer, R-Texas, to
dismantle the Internal Revenue Service and overhaul the tax system are
interviews with the press.

But he did offer some opinions about the proposals.  Here are a few snippets:

National retail sales tax:  "They'd have to control cascading [taxes on top of
taxes].  ...  [The plan's backers] want a killing off of the IRS.  I call them
the tax militia.  They think Republicans who favor the flat tax or
Nunn/Domenici are ultra-liberal."

Flat tax:  "The key element is for international trade.  Everything made in
the United States is taxed, even if it is exported.  If there's no taxation on
operations outside the United States the whole nature of international tax
planning goes out the window."

USA plan:  "Exports will have border relief, but exports will be taxed."

Value-added tax:  "A credit invoice system will never happen here.
Politicians don't like that obvious nature."  In other words, taxpayers would
see how much their government costs them.

Geo.  S.  Olive acquires local health care consulting firm


INDIANAPOLIS - In a move that doubles its fees in the health care niche and
establishes a consulting arm, regional firm Geo.  S.  Olive & Co.  has
acquired local boutique Kimmerling, Myers & Co.

Now the largest health care practice in the state, GSO is poised for even
further expansion in the niche, managing partner John Harris said.

"Our effort is to become part of the health care industry, not just to serve
it," Harris said, adding that the firm will become more involved with trade
associations and seminars, and will even develop some products - such as
benchmarking statistics - useful to the industry.  "Our goal is to become the
largest health care consulting firm in the Midwest."

GSO's $2 million health care practice had consisted mainly of compliance work,
while the $2 million Kimmerling, Myers is virtually all consulting.  GSO,
which ended fiscal year May 1995 at $43 million, expects to jump to $50
million by May 1996, Harris said.

"They were servicing clients we didn't have access to," Harris said.  "We
didn't have the consulting experience."

"GSO had physician clients, while Kimmerling, Myers served facility clients,"
said Jeff Kimmerling, managing partner of Kimmerling, Myers.  "It made sense
to put our work together.  We expect to double the health care practice in two
years."

GSO's health care practice will operate out of Kimmerling, Myer's Indianapolis
office under the name Olive Health Care Consulting.  The division will be
headed by Kimmerling, who joins GSO as a partner along with James Myers,
Michael Merkel and Michael Craig.  KM's 20 staff members also joins GSO.

With 10 offices throughout Indiana and Illinois, GSO now has 70 partners and
more than 600 staff.  The few people comprising GSO's existing health care
practice will move into the Olive Health Care Consulting office, Harris said.
Ten new hires have been made to supplement that office, Harris added.


PRACTICE MANAGEMENT:  AICPA woos college students with interactive CD-ROM

NEW YORK - It may not stir quite as much interest as a keg party, but the
American Institute of CPAs has created a funky-yet-informative CD-ROM aimed at
encouraging college students to become CPAs.

The second phase of the AICPA's two-level campaign to encourage new recruits
to the profession, "Room Zoom:  The CPA SourceDisc," offers students a variety
of windows into a CPA's world.  The interactive CD contains about 20 minutes
of video, audio and still photos, plus a large body of text and plenty of
graphics.

"We needed the proper medium," said John Daidone, AICPA manager of recruiting
programs.  "CD-ROM offers the best approach to illustrate the CPA profession
as being technically proficient."

The AICPA has produced 5,000 CDs which will be sent to the state societies,
the recruiting contacts at larger firms and several colleges and universities
across the nation, Daidone said.  The state societies are encouraged to
distribute the CDs directly to local colleges as well.  Additional copies of
the CD will cost $5 each, with discounts if more than 10 are ordered.  The
AICPA spent $300,000 on the production and distribution of the CDs and the
accompanying posters.

The CD opens with a young resident of a home office welcoming her "guest."
The user is told to make herself at home while the host runs out for a minute.
As the user moves the mouse across the screen, different cartoon-like bubbles
appear, displaying one of the gateways that provide more information.  For
instance, when moving the mouse to the bookshelf, the user is offered the
option of investigating library resources.  Choose the safe and learn about
salaries; a calendar leads to "a day in the life."  Other gateways include
"career opportunities," "ladder of success," "human resources," "tools of the
trade" and "organizations."

The career opportunities gateway features CPAs in various segments of the
profession offering insights on their career successes.  Human resources sheds
light on key issues such as balancing personal and professional life and
career opportunities for women and minorities.  The library features
information on the Uniform CPA Examination and a directory of more than 800
institutions across the United States that offer accounting programs.

The AICPA stepped up its recruiting efforts after a 1990 poll found students
unimpressed with the role of accountants.  "That's why we made this effort,"
Daidone said.  "In general we found that a lot of negative stereotypes about
accountants came out in the survey.  They thought accountants were boring
number crunchers who worked alone."

The first phase of the recruitment effort was aimed at high school and early
college students.  A video produced in 1993 introduced viewers to the
accounting profession.

"The first phase of the program, 'Accounting:  One degree with 360 degrees of
possibilities,' was designed to attract students to the study of accounting,"
Daidone said.  "In this second phase we're taking it up one more level and
trying to attract students to become CPAs."

IRS tells how workers can declare 'independence'


by Ken Rankin


WASHINGTON - Responding to criticism that some Internal Revenue Service
regions are conducting a witch hunt against businesses that classify workers
as independent contractors, top tax service officials are preparing new
instructions to discourage such heavy handed enforcement tactics.

According to IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson, new training
materials under development for IRS examiners will "emphasize the principle
that using independent contractors can be a legitimate business practice that
will not be challenged by the service."

A new headquarters policy embodied in the training materials will require
faster resolution of worker classification disputes and uniform standards for
defining independent contractors throughout the country.

Testifying before Congress late last year, Richardson said she hoped to have
the new worker classification materials finalized in time to permit retraining
of all IRS examiners by the end of this month.

The new training aids are the latest in a series of moves by the IRS to defuse
mounting criticism from accountants and small businesses that the agency's
crackdown on the use of independent contractors is improper and abusive.

Adding to the concerns are the stiff penalties for businesses charged with
violating the current standards.

Employers accused of incorrectly classifying W-2 workers as independent
contractors can be required to pay 100 percent of both the employer's and the
employee's share of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, plus all of
the federal income taxes that would have been withheld had the contractor been
classified as a salaried employee.

If the IRS declares the classification error to be intentional - a finding the
agency is not required to prove - the business can be hit with an additional
100 percent penalty, plus interest for previous years.

Delegates to this summer's White House Conference on Small Business identified
reform of IRS independent contractor ground rules as their No.  1 priority,
and during subsequent House hearings on the problem, CPAs from across the
country called for legislation to set simpler rules governing worker
classification.

Shaken by the backlash against the agency's current enforcement strategy, IRS
officials placed much of the blame on overzealous field examiners.

To ensure uniform treatment of all businesses under investigation for
independent contractor violations, the IRS adopted new procedures requiring
regional and local personnel to secure approval from the national office in
Washington before undertaking any large worker classification projects.

The program will be based on the following series of principles which
Richardson said would govern future IRS policy in worker classification cases:

* Worker classification issues should be resolved as quickly and as early in
the administrative process as possible.  * Worker classification issues should
be resolved uniformly throughout the country.  * Resolution of worker
classification issues should take into account a taxpayer's past compliance
with section 530, as well as the common law standard (governing worker
classification).  * The IRS compliance programs should encourage correct
classification and correct reporting of payments to workers.  *
Reclassification of workers who have legitimately been treated as independent
contractors must be avoided.

Audit & Accounting:  Change Of Auditors


US 1 SHIFTS FROM DELOITTE TO COOPERS:  Deloitte & Touche was dismissed as
independent accountant for US 1 Industries after helping the client correct a
series of internal control problems ranging from unrecorded transactions to
inadequate computerized accounting systems.

Over a year ago, Deloitte informed officials at the Gary, Ind.  company that
US 1's management was "unable to close the accounting records and produce
reliable financial statements within the time frames required for public
companies."

"Significant transactions had occurred that had not been recorded on the books
and records of the company, including sales of property, repossession of
equipment, and contingencies related to broken lease commitments and other
contractual agreements," the client told the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

In addition, "supporting documentation for a significant number of sales, cost
of sales, cash receipts and other general ledger journal entries could not be
located."

Although accountants at Deloitte concluded that the company had adequately
addressed each of these issues, US 1 elected to replace that firm with Coopers
& Lybrand.

CANADIAN ACCOUNTANTS SOUR ON WINCANTON FOLLOWING QUESTIONABLE DEALS:  Canadian
accountants at KPMG Peat Marwick Thorne resigned as auditor for Reno,
Nev.-based Wincanton Corp.  after informing the client that they were
"unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by
management."

KPMG's concerns were stirred by a series of recent transactions, including the
sale of stock in the company's Tradesman Industries subsidiary to Work
Recovery Inc.  for shares of that corporation valued at some $2.5 million.

The accountants also raised questions about a $9.6 million consulting fee paid
to Work Recovery in connection with the sale of cargo bed and tailgate systems
technology to that company.

In disassociating themselves from the client's financial statements, the
Vancouver-based accountants said they couldn't obtain sufficient appropriate
audit evidence on the propriety of these transactions.

PRACTICE MANAGEMENT FORUM:  Looking ahead to the year 2001:  A sales odyssey

WANTED SALES MANAGER FOR BIG 4 FIRM

Local office of Big Four firm seeks experienced sales manager for midsized
office.  Must have CPA and at least three years sales management experience at
a large CPA firm.  Responsibilities will include oversight and development of
experienced staff of three client-relators as well as penetration of
non-client accounts.  Send resume to Box 1234.

This ad was spotted in the Feb.  9, 2001, edition of The Wall Street Journal.

Surprised?  You shouldn't be.  Impossible?  Don't bet on it.  Unlikely
prediction?  Hardly.  Some local offices of Big Six and regional firms are
already employing salespeople.

Our profession has never been more competitive, and the new millennium will
have a great deal of change in store for accountants.

Here are some more predictions:

* Non-CPA firms will continue to encroach upon our "turf."

Did you know that four of the 10 fastest growing accounting firms in the
United States are not CPA firms?  Most people don't - including your partners.

American Express just won its federal suit against the state of Florida,
permitting non-CPA firms to employ CPAs.

As other states look to this case, reviews and audits may fall to non-CPAs.
After all, why shouldn't non-CPAs perform these same services?  If they pass
the peer review process, wouldn't this open up a monopoly to more competition,
and wouldn't the consumer ultimately benefit from lower costs?  Accounting
could be next in the line of industries the government has already
deregulated, like telephone companies and airlines.

I hope it happens.  Just as we are driving much better cars today than 20
years ago because of the competition from the Japanese, clients will receive a
much higher level of service when CPAs compete in a marketplace against real
business people, not just other accountants.

* Big companies will increase efforts to attract the best clients of their
smaller rivals.

Competition will increase not only from below - non-CPAs - but also from
above.  Many big firms have stagnant revenues and will increase their emphasis
on obtaining regional and local firms' "A" clients.  This trend has developed
steadily in some markets for the last five years, and will continue to grow.

* Competition will increase as CPAs leave stagnant firms to take more control
over their careers.

Sharp managers and young partners realize they are often held back by partners
who won't let go of the management reins and allow the firm to prosper and
change.

These rainmakers are already leaving firms in droves, taking some of their
clients.  This trend will continue as these hotshots realize many of them are
buying into firms that have been drained of assets by greedy partners facing
retirement, with no desire to invest in technology, training or client
relationships.

These changes will affect our profession in numerous ways by the turn of the
century.  For instance:

* A formalized sales management function will control the development of
business.

Firms will hire salespeople.  CPAs will be highly valued, and recruited
specifically for sales.  Some will drop out of the technical side as they see
the road to partnership open only to those who bring in business.  Many firms
will see hiring salespeople as a panacea for stalled growth, since their
partners don't want to be involved in the selling process.

* The technical aspect of our profession will be relegated to the "back room."

As our profession becomes more competitive, business development, rather than
the quality of technical work, will be recognized as the life blood of the
professional firm.

Firms will focus on garnering new business.  Firms that don't shift emphasis
will merge or perish.

* Dramatic decreases in fee structures will hit the profession across all
service lines.

As the increased emphasis on marketing prompts clients to become more aware of
alternatives, fee competition will escalate.  Fees will be cut in all areas of
service, not just in audit and accounting.

* Only people with existing books of business will be promoted to full
partnership.

Technicians will no longer be able to share in the fruits of full partnership
as firms finally realize that it is far easier to acquire technical ability
than entrepreneurial talent.  Just as industrial companies raid competitors
for successful salespeople, CPA firms will vie for rainmakers.

* The profession's image of trust and respectability will be tarnished as
clients equate CPAs with other sales-types that they deal with.

CPA salespeople will fall into the same grab bag for dollars as other
salespeople.  Clients will view them with the same disdain as printing and
insurance salespeople.

* CPA firms will use consulting as the main inroad to new clients.

Even small accounting firms will offer free consulting work just to get their
foot in the door.

* The most successful firms will not employ salespeople, but will have
developed a solid core of practicing entrepreneurs.

Some firms will have decided early on to succeed in a much more competitive
environment without resorting to a separate force of salespeople.  Realizing
that marketing and selling is just as important as technical skill, these
firms will have invested in growing the business development skills of their
most likely producers.  Their reputation as trusted business advisors will
remain intact.

So where do marketing people fit in?

Marketing directors still play a powerful role, whether establishing a
formalized sales function or creating an internal culture of entrepreneurship.

In either case, somebody still has to manage the marketing aspects, enhance
the sales process and help bring in the actual opportunities to sell.  Merely
hiring salespeople will not work without a comprehensive, integrated marketing
plan so that all are pursuing the optimal targeted clients and markets.

In some cases, the marketing director will also assume the role of sales
manager, as many firms will be too small or too cheap to hire someone separate
to manage that function.

In firms that decide to shun the salesperson route by becoming
entrepreneurial, marketing directors will have to take on the role of internal
sales manager.

What can you do now?

CPAs who turn their backs on this undeniable trend towards increased
competition will watch their firms disintegrate.

There are, however, certain preemptive tactics your firm can employ to avoid
the oncoming onslaught:

* Establish a beachhead in the marketplace that is difficult to penetrate.

Chrysler is a great example of what can happen in a changing marketplace.  For
years, Chrysler and their Detroit rivals ignored the increased competition
from the Japanese.  Fat and sassy, they believed people would continue to buy
cars the way they always had.  Caught off-guard by a dramatically changed
marketplace that demanded small, well-made, fuel-efficient cars, they lost a
significant piece of market share that they've never made up.  Chrysler almost
went out of business.

In order to survive, Chrysler had to get smart.  In the early '80s, they
introduced a new vehicle - the minivan - and created a new marketplace.  As
their competitors jumped on the bandwagon, they pressed forward, leading the
way in design and features.  By the time their competitors had established a
position in the market, Chrysler was so entrenched that they still sell more
minivans than ever.

* Make sure your firm has a strategic marketing plan.

Amazingly, even many of those firms with marketing directors have no strategic
marketing plan that delineates where and how they are going to go to market
for the next three to five years.  If you don't know where your business is
going to come from, how can you get it?

* Get your people trained to sell and market.

Personal marketing and selling skills do not come naturally to the vast
majority of CPAs, but many firms expect CPAs to somehow learn these skills by
accident.  Identifying clients and prospects' needs and wants and persuading
people to do business with you are far greater skills than being an auditor or
a tax person.

* Concentrate on client service.

It's time the accounting profession learned to service the clients in the way
they want to be served.  Since this subject still isn't taught in accounting
school, it's up to you to drive the message home internally.  If you don't get
your people up to par in delivering exemplary service, remember that someone
else will.

Establish monthly client service meetings, where the only subject discussed is
how to better serve your clients, helping them be more successful.

* Help your people establish and pursue niches.

Our profession is the last to realize the importance of marketing
specifically, not generically.  It is obvious to the real business person
(i.e., your clients) that there is more value in dealing with someone who is
an expert in their field.

* Help your people set goals for practice development.

Everybody must have their own goal for new business, otherwise how can they
tell if they've been successful?

* Change the compensation and review process.

What's in it for your non-partners?  Practice development must be rewarded
financially and psychologically, or it won't happen.

Only the most successful CPAs embrace change - the great majority have their
noses to their computers, happy to leave things as they are.  It's up to you
to educate your partners on all that is happening in the marketplace.  And
you'll need to keep telling them until they finally get the message.  Stir
things up now and take control of your firm's destiny.  If you don't, your
competition will do it for you.

SOFTWARE REVIEW:  Budgetary moves add steam to fund accounting


The current balanced budget debate in Washington signals that many services
currently provided by the federal government may soon pass to the states and
the private sector.

This trend will translate into new opportunities for accounting firms, because
the not-for-profit sector will expand rapidly, as states look to
not-for-profits to administer displaced programs.  And new nonprofit
organizations will develop to handle programs no longer conducted by the
government.

Not-for-profits will look to CPAs for the management accounting services
required to implement new control systems and to measure operating results.
To take advantage of these opportunities, accounting firms must become
familiar with the software tools that are available for this complex area.

Fund accounting is not an easy area in which to work.  Issues and concepts in
not-for-profit accounting differ from those found in the profit sector.
Accountability with specific program and grant provisions is critical and
requires extensive departmentalization of information.  Multiple accounting
periods must be considered, as information will be reported not only by fiscal
year, but by program or grant period.

Necessary reports include traditional reports needed by management, as well as
those required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, grant providers
and other regulatory bodies.

This article evaluates five not-for-profit software systems from Executive
Data Systems, Blackbaud, American FundWare, Micro Information Products and
Kenrick Technologies.  The last year has seen fund accounting software vendors
accelerate their move into Windows.  All the vendors in this review have a
Windows program on the market or will offer one during this year.

The move to Windows has been slow and for good reason.  Many nonprofit
organizations have older equipment and tight budgets which preclude rapid
upgrades to new technology.

But moving to Windows should provide clients with smoother links to other
applications, if for no other reason than vendors most often rewrite their
packages in Microsoft or other standard languages.

For example, MIPS Fund Accounting for Windows utilizes C++, Microsoft's Visual
Basic programming languages and the Microsoft Access database engine.  This
move to Microsoft standards has been seen in general accounting packages and
is accelerating in all desktop applications.

Critical issues to be considered when selecting fund accounting software
include account structure handling, report presentation capabilities,
ease-of-use and non-accounting features such as fund-raising support and
mailing list capabilities.

Flexibility in account number format is important to meet the needs of many
different clients.  Account numbering schemes generally determine the
departmentalization of information.  The more flexible the format, the less
need for changing a client's existing account numbering system.  Also, more
flexibility means easier filtering of data for reporting purposes.

Also important is that all fund accounting packages should meet the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statements of
Financial Standards 116 and 117.  All the packages reviewed here are compliant
with these standards.

There is more to an accounting system than just accounting information.  In
the profit sector, modules such as accounts receivable, accounts payable and
payroll provide capabilities that may be more critical than the general
ledger.  For a not-for-profit business, you must add modules for fund-raising
and grant information requirement compliance.

Fund accounting concepts and accounting systems are not just complex to the
accountant/consultant.  The staff of a not-for-profit organization may also
find them difficult.

Therefore, ease-of-use should be a primary criterion in the selection process
and should encompass the system's look and feel, data entry conventions,
documentation, on-screen help capabilities and vendor support.

Special system features that will make the accountant's/ consultant's job
easier and more profitable should also be considered.  Reporting features that
prepare financial statements and workpapers in formats that can be used as
part of the compilation, review, or audit process can greatly reduce the time
spent on these engagements.

Also, if the fund accounting vendor offers special programs for the
accountant/consultant for support or reduced pricing, these engagements will
be more profitable.

It is in reselling or consulting that CPAs will make the real money on such
software.

Except for Blackbaud, which uses only direct sales, all the vendors reviewed
here offer reseller programs.  Generally, these programs offer product
discounts and special incentives on promotions and technical support.  Kenrick
offers both reseller and consulting programs, the latter for non-selling
firms, although other vendors also support consultants.

Fund AccountingSoftware Series, Executive Data Systems

Fund Accounting Software Series from Executive Data Systems is a DOS-based
system with a Windows interface for module and process selection.

This approach allows the FASS to be used in organizations with both DOS and
Windows workstations.  The latest 5.5 release of FASS introduces two Windows
components, FASS Access and the Export module, which facilitate data transfer.

FASS Access offers the export of information to Access.  In Access, you can
then perform advanced data queries and prepare on-screen and printed reports.
Access data is easily used with other Windows applications such as
spreadsheets, word processors and report writers.

The Export module also exports information in 20 file formats such as Lotus,
Quattro Pro and Paradox.  This module also includes an Excel compatible
spreadsheet and graphics package.  It features extensive preformatted
financial statement reporting capabilities.  FASS financial statements can be
consolidated by "wild-card" selection or by using user-defined fund groups.

The Multi Fiscal Year Project Reporting module allows the preparation of
financial statements for any range of dates, including multiple fiscal years.
The Custom Report Generator can access FASS accounting and donor information
based on user defined criteria to prepare management reports and graphs, and
to export to other applications.

The FASS Donor Records module maintains an extensive database of the
organization's members, donors, alumni and volunteers for reporting and
mailing purposes.  This module integrates with General Ledger and will track
pledges, dues payments, donations and matching gift data.  More than 30
user-definable data fields can customize the information captured for each
donor.

Transaction detail can be maintained as long as desired.  The system supports
multiple, overlapping fiscal years for grant and project reporting.  Grant and
project reporting is independent of the organization's fiscal year.

Data entry is accelerated through the use of "code tables" for automatic
transaction descriptions, and the user can define transaction entry modes to
save keystrokes.

Executive Data Systems features toll-free support and offers a service to set
up the client's chart of accounts and financial statements.  The cost of this
service varies with the amount of data involved.

Blackbaud Accountingfor Non Profits, Blackbaud

Blackbaud's current offerings include the DOS-based application, Blackbaud Not
For Profit Accounting, Windows versions of its Raiser's Edge fund-raising
system and its Paragon planned giving software.

The company plans to release Windows versions of business applications
beginning in April.  Current purchasers with software maintenance agreements
will receive a Windows upgrade at no charge.

Blackbaud features a table-driven chart of accounts that breaks down each
account by fund, account number, account type, department/cost center,
category and object of expenditure.  A visual chart-of-account organizer that
allows you to see and rearrange the chart of accounts makes setting up and
editing accounts a simple task.

Accounts for new funds can easily be created by copying sample charts of
accounts for similar funds.  General ledger information can be maintained for
two years.  The current year need not be closed to work on subsequent year's
information.  The year-end close can be delayed for up to twelve months while
awaiting final audit adjustments.

The Raiser's Edge supports the organization's gifting development program.
Paragon provides the planned giving professional a tool for easily calculating
and graphing the outcome of planned gifts.  Both products are available in
Windows versions.  The Raiser's Edge also comes in a DOS version.

Windows capabilities are often only marginally advantageous in data entry.
However, The Raiser's Edge and Paragon demonstrate the advantages of the
graphical interface over a text-based application in the area of data review
and editing.  Reviewing and updating information is very easy and intuitive.
Entry of new information is enhanced with pull-down menus and keystroke
shortcuts.

The system has extensive on- screen reporting capabilities featuring very
readable reports.  The system features very flexible report-writing tools.
Reports can be segmented to provide information about projects and grants and
can be either date- or period-driven to support varying reporting periods.
Workpapers can be prepared from system information by saving report
information in a spreadsheet format.

FundWare on Windows, American Fundware

American Fundware offers an extensive suite of applications to meet the
accounting needs of not-for-profit organizations.  Fundware offers 17 modules
on multiple platforms and three Windows specific modules.

Fundware runs on a variety of operating systems including DOS, Windows, Unix
and AIX.  The system can consolidate not-for-profit transactions as well as
any for-profit enterprises the entity may operate.

American Fundware has just released FundWare on Windows, which has the ability
to run multiple sessions simultaneously through the FundWare on Windows
Session Manager.

A File Viewer makes it easier to access the Windows Print Manager utility,
improving printer selection and making it possible to preview reports prior to
printing.

Monarch for FundWare is a version of the Datawatch Monarch Windows data access
and analysis tool specifically designed to run with FundWare.  With Monarch
for FundWare, you can use spooled report file information to view, query,
analyze and export information.

Essentially, Monarch is a report generator in reverse.  Report information is
converted into Monarch data, which can then be "mined" to meet specific
reporting needs using spreadsheets and report generators.

The FundWare Corridor improves FundWare's data connectivity with other
applications by providing open access to the FundWare database.  Information
is presented in Microsoft's Open Database Connectivity standard.  ODBC
compliance allows the data to be accessed by other ODBC-compliant applications
such as Excel, 1-2-3, Access and Crystal Reports.

FundWare allows you to design your own account structure of up to 18 digits,
or you can use a predefined chart of accounts.  Two aliases can be assigned to
each account to easily look up accounts that have different descriptions in
different funds, accounts, grants or projects.  General ledger information can
be retained for an unlimited amount of time.  The system provides up to four
adjustment accounting periods for segregating year-end and audit adjustments
from the normal posting periods.

The Allocation Management System automates transaction allocation and can be
used to extract information for reallocations.  American Fundware does not
have a fund-raising module, but it links to donor packages from PledgeMaker,
Donor Perfect and others.

It also features an allocation management module for handling
multi-fund/department allocation of transactions.  This feature is used to
automatically allocate recurring transactions among multiple accounts, funds
or projects.

The Budget Forecasting module extracts historical information into a separate
database for creating and revising the entity's budget.  This module will
track up to 60 budget revisions and allows the updating of historical
information without changing budget data.

A separate Budget Control module monitors budget compliance and warns when an
account approaches or exceeds its budget.  Report capabilities include macros
to group reports for batch printing.  Masks are employed to filter report
information by fund, grant and project.

The Extended Report Writer prepares reports from any journal and any period
maintained in the system.  This module also maintains an extended database of
information such as population, grant dates and number of clients served.  The
information can be used in combination with other financial data to produce
reports.

MIP NonProfit Seriesfor Windows, Micro Information Products Inc.

MIP's NonProfit Series for Windows, introduced in November, is designed using
non-proprietary tools:  C++, Microsoft's Visual Basic programming language and
the Access database engine.  MIP also released MIP Fund Accounting for DOS,
Version 9.0 at the same time.

The Windows release began with the General Ledger module and will be followed
by Accounts Payable, Budgeting and Payroll modules in the first six months of
this year.  Other modules will continue to be released this year, including
Fund Raising.

MIP offers many ease-of-use features such as Wizards for information setup,
customizable tool bars, and Windows-compliant screens, menus and help.  MIP
also features extensive security capabilities that define security for each
user, module and organization.  Security also can be defined for any menu
level.

The system supports complete GASB and FASB reporting and reports can cover any
time period.  The software features many standard reports that are the
building blocks for customized reports.  Reports are customized by the rows
and columns of information that the user wants included in the report.

The system's design allows the use of data with other applications such as
database tools, spreadsheets and word processors.  For example, it supports
direct query, with proper security, from within Microsoft Excel or Word.

MIP allows an unlimited number of user-definable general ledger account
segments which can be up to 255 characters in length each.  Field size and
data formatting within fields can be user-defined.  An Account Setup Wizard
makes it easy to set up new information and to model new accounts from
existing information.

MIP Fund Accounting does not have its own fund-raising module, but supports
links to Donor Perfect, Donor$ and Softrek fund-raising packages.  Transaction
information can be exported to other applications in ASCII, Delimited ASCII,
 .WKS and DBF formats.

The system features strong context-sensitive help tools.  The complete user
manual can be viewed on screen.  With maintenance, all upgrades are free.

The company guarantees a new release of each product every 18 months.  MIP
guarantees a two-hour response time for customer support calls.

Kenrick Fund Accounting for Windows, Kenrick Technologies

Kenrick Technologies was scheduled to ship Version 2 of its Fund Accounting
for Windows this month.  A true Windows application, the new product expands
upon the company's DOS version 4.1's use of C language source code, thus
benefitting from the original source code's maturity.

Release 2.0 features several new ease-of-use features.  Journal Genies are
used to integrate journal information from a variety of data sources into the
general journal.  Using Genies, information in spreadsheet-prepared workpapers
can be the source of journal transactions.

Another new feature, Two-Way Spreadsheet Journal Entries, allows the software
to furnish information for spreadsheet workpapers.  Kenrick uses Dynamic Data
Exchange linking to exchange information with other Windows applications.

The chart of account structure is divided into components for account code,
department and fund.  There are as many as 17 segments and virtually unlimited
sub-accounts within the account number structure.  The number of digits of the
components of the account number structure can be varied to meet the needs of
each nonprofit entity.  The minimum length is five characters; the maximum,
20.

When new funds or departments are added to the system, the accounts for the
new addition can be mirrored from the existing chart.  Transaction information
can be maintained indefinitely.  Kenrick's approach to grant accounting makes
grant (or project) identifiers a component of the general ledger account
structure.

Grants and projects can also be handled separately from the chart of accounts
by entering grant and project code information at the transaction level.  This
simplifies the setup of short-term projects and grants and allows more
comprehensive reporting on grants and projects.

Reports can be prepared for any accounting period, regardless of the entity's
fiscal accounting period.  The KenQuery feature offers fast searches of system
database information for sorting and printing data.  Custom reporting
capabilities are provided via a dBase style report writer.

One unique feature is Kenrick's 990 tax return support.  The system will
transfer revenue and expense information directly into the Arthur Andersen
A-Plus Tax 990/990PF program.

Kenrick offers very flexible budgeting features.  The Projects and Grants
module allows for unlimited project/grant lives and multiple budgets for any
part of the organization.  This information can be grouped for any date range
at any time.  The system maintains budget data for the last budget period, the
current period and the next period approved budget.

The system offers extensive on-screen help capabilities.  All information
found in the paper manuals is in on-screen help.  The company also offers data
conversion, training and related network support.

Summary

CPAs and consultants are in for a bonanza with not-for-profit organizations.
As more services move from the federal government to the states and private
organizations, the need for tax, financial reporting and consulting services
will rapidly expand.  The addition of Windows versions by many fund accounting
software vendors will also increase the opportunities for CPAs.

DOS users will be interested in moving to the more powerful Windows
applications.  This will offer the opportunity to provide new and profitable
services.

Also, the new Windows applications offer expanded connectivity features.
Consultants will be able to provide on-going services for developing reports
and information systems that link fund accounting software information to
other applications.
