<STRONG>Here Today...Gone Tomorrow?</STRONG>



<P>
If you are 43 years old today and expect to begin receiving Social Security benefits at
age 66,
your
"normal retirement age" under present law, you may be in for a surprise.  In the year
2016 the
Social
Security program will begin running cash deficits.  
<P>
At first, the problem will be manageable: benefit payments and administrative costs will
exceed
income
by only $13 billion.  Within five years, however, the shortfall will be $200 billion
annually. Ten
years later,
it will be nearly $1 trillion. By the early 2020's, if not earlier, Social Security
benefits will almost
certainly
have to be reduced, if the program is to have any hope of meeting its obligations.
<P>
Social Security's Board of Trustees, whose financial projections are the basis for this
analysis,
says
not to worry, the system won't go broke until 2036.  They estimate that the trust funds
will rise to a
healthy nest egg of $5.6 trillion in 2024, two and a half times the projected annual
payout at that
time. 
According to the trustees, benefits will then be assured for another 12 years, as the
assets in the
trust
fund are sold off. There is a major problem, however, with the trustees' projection of a
40-year
margin
of safety: there may be no money in those trust funds when it is time to draw them down.
The
money
may have already been spent on other government programs.
<P>
When Social Security's income exceeds its expenses, the surplus is retained by the
Treasury and
used
to meet the government's non-Social Security expenses. For example, the recent gradual
rise in
Social
Security payroll taxes, from 10.8 percent of wages and salaries in 1983 to 12.4 percent
today, has
led to
annual surpluses that went to finance B-2 bombers, farm subsidies, savings and loan
bailouts,
and
other general federal expenditures. In return for using these funds, the Treasury issues
special
bonds
to the trust funds.
<P>
When Social Security's expenses exceed its income, theoretically these bonds can be
redeemed
to
meet current obligations.  Beginning in 2016, the Treasury will need to begin redeeming
these
bonds.
They will have to find the cash somewhere else.  Unfortunately, the choices are limited,
and none
are
politically attractive.
<P>
The Treasury has three options:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> <STRONG>Sell bonds to the public.</STRONG> Whether the public has sufficient
appetite to buy additional bonds 
at an average rate of $500 billion per year, even in the inflated dollars of 2025-2035, 
remains to be seen.
	<LI> <STRONG>Raise taxes.</STRONG>  Policymakers can raise taxes to provide the
Treasury with the necessary 
money. More directly, they could raise Social Security taxes, reducing the need for bond 
redemptions.
	<LI> <STRONG>Print money.</STRONG> This would increase the inflation rate. Because
Social Security benefit 
increases are tied to changes in the Consumer Price Index, inflation would result in
even 
higher benefit costs and the need to redeem bonds more rapidly, not to mention other
deleterious
economic effects.
</UL>

<P>
Rather than trying, probably unsuccessfully, to redeem the trillions of dollars in bonds
accumulated
over several decades, policymakers would likely enact a package of revenue increases and
benefit
reductions that would bring Social Security's income and outgo into balance in 2016, or
shortly
after.
The following big ticket items are likely to be included in such a package:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> <STRONG>Increased Social Security taxes.</STRONG> Tax increases are easy to
explain, and most 
workers pay the additional amounts through withholding from wages and salaries.
	<LI> <STRONG>Increased taxation of benefits.</STRONG> Since 1984, beneficiaries with
moderately high 
incomes ($25,000 for individuals, $32,000 for married couples filing joint returns)
have 
paid federal income taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security benefits. The 50% figure 
can be raised easily. In fact, this has already been proposed so often that it is likely
to occur 
long before 2016.
	<LI> <STRONG>Reductions in COLAs.</STRONG> Social Security's cost-of-living
adjustments were delayed 6
months by legislation in 1983. They could be delayed again, reduced, or frozen 
temporarily.
	<LI> <STRONG>Increase the Normal Retirement Age (NRA).</STRONG> The 1983 legislation
raised the NRA 
gradually, from 65 for workers born before 1938, to 67 for those born after 1959. These 
changes are present law, not just proposals. Congress has already demonstrated that it
can 
raise the NRA, and there is no reason to believe that they will stop at age 67.
</UL>

<P>
It certainly appears that the Social Security program will not be as rich for tomorrow's
retirees as it
is for
today's. People who hoped to be enjoying their retirement after 2016 should start saving
more
now if
they want to maintain a comfortable standard of living after retiring. The necessary
amounts
cannot be
saved during the last few working years; they must be accumulated over a much longer
period of
time.
Even if the trustees are correct, Social Security will have serious problems beginning
in 2036 and
will
need to change. Today's workers need to know that now, while they still have time to
modify their
retirement planning.
