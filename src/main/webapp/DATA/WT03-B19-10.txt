WebFeats specializes in bringing the small business or entrepreneur to the world's 
notice by creating a disctinctive and personalized Web presence.<P>

Through the World Wide Web, your company can access a customer base of millions. It 
gives you the opportunity to offer information, knowledge, and even entertainment
as you describe your product or service.<P>

The same kind of distribution outside of the Internet would cost far more than you
would care to invest in your advertising budget.<P>

I will work with you to create exactly the site you want at a cost that is within
your means.<P>

I have well over a year of experience creating Web sites. In addition to the sites
linked to this site, I have created sites at the University of Oregon, where I sat
on the Web Committee that designed their original site. I have also created hundreds
of pages for Hewlett Packard's internal Web materials.<P>

I have a deep background in the computer industry, having worked at Apple Computer
and Silicon Graphics. I am also a writer, as well as a Web developer.
