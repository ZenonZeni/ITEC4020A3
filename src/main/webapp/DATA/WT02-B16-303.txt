<p><strong>Bergey Windpower BWC Excel</strong>
<br>The Bergey BWC Excel is a 10-kW, three-bladed, direct
drive, upwind wind turbine with passive blade-pitch control.
To achieve overspeed protection, the rotor yaws out of the
wind. The rotor diameter is 7 meters (21 feet). The BWC
Excel wind turbine is designed to supply most of the
electricity for an average all-electric home in areas with an
average wind speed of 12 mph. In remote locations, it can
charge batteries for stand-alone applications or pump water
electrically without the need for batteries. More than 1400
BWC wind turbines have been installed in a total of more
than 60 countries.
