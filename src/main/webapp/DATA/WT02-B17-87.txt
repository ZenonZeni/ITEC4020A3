<B>Technical and Economic Analyses of Renewable Hydrogen Production;

<P>

The level of technoeconomic analysis appropriate for a 

project is dictated by the maturity of the technology and the amount of 
data that has been 

gathered, as well as the purpose of the evaluation.  A new initiative 
may require only a literature 

search in order to determine if process costs can be estimated from 
related systems or if 

laboratory data is needed first.  Alternatively, a cost boundary 
analysis is appropriate for a 

project which has been conceptualized but has not generated a 
significant amount of data.  This 

type of analysis determines the minimum yields, maximum manufacturing 
costs, and necessary 

market conditions for the technology to be economically competitive. 
Finally, a highly detailed 

analysis can be performed on processes which have been more or less 
fully conceptualized, and 

laboratory work has provided yield and operating data.  This type of 
analysis includes a process 

flowsheet, material and energy balances, equipment cost estimation, and 
the determination of the 

cost of the final product over the expected life of an industrial-scale 
plant.

<P>

The purpose of performing technoeconomic, or systems, analyses is 
several-fold.  First, 

in a research environment, the near and eventual economic 
competitiveness of a project can be 

assessed.  Second, results of any of the above mentioned levels of 
analysis are useful in guiding 

experimental planning.  For example, if the cost of a process is found 
to be highly sensitive to 

equipment costs but relatively insensitive to energy costs, the research 
would be directed 

towards reducing the cost of fabricating the plant or unit.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>:

<P>


Initial economic analysis results were obtained for the cost boundary

analysis of hydrogen production via biological water-gas shift

catalysis.  The base case analysis looked at a trickle filter

reactor followed by a PSA system to purify the hydrogen.  The

assumed productivity was 1.5 mmol H<sub>2</sub>/min g cells.  At a 
production

capacity of 46 tonnes per day, the hydrogen selling price was

$17/GJ.  A sensitivity analysis revealed that a tenfold increase

in productivity can significantly reduce this price.  Additionally,

researchers believe that a high-pressure system would allow for

productivities as high as 150 mmol H<sub>2</sub>/min g cells.  This case


was not included in the sensitivity analysis since the capital

cost would change significantly for a high-pressure system.  Future

analyses will examine such a system and one using the hollow fiber

reactor.

<P>

The technoeconomic analysis of photoelectrochemical-based direct

conversion systems indicated quite clearly that the cost of the

photoelectrochemical cell dominates the cost of the system. A cost 

boundary analysis giving the contribution of the photoelectrochemical 

cell cost to the hydrogen selling price was done.  The more 

expensive tandem cells will most likely never produce hydrogen 

at economic prices.  Because they have the correct band gaps

for water splitting, however, it is appropriate to study them at 

the current basic research level.  Lessons learned on these cells 

must eventually be applied to the lower cost thin films.  These 

cells have the potential to produce hydrogen at competitive 

costs even at fairly lower efficiencies.

<P>

The determination of the overall installed cost of a fiber-optic

hydrogen detector system in a passenger vehicle was completed.

 The system design is based on the initial prototype being constructed

at NREL.  The following production scenarios were examined:  6

sensors/vehicle and 20 sensors/vehicle for a production rate of

5,000 vehicles/year and for 3 million vehicles/year.  The amount

of sensors required per vehicle will depend on the size of the

vehicle and the layout of the hydrogen fuel system.  Two 
microprocessors,

with different cycling speeds, were also examined; the low-cost

microprocessor should be adequate for monitoring hydrogen detection.

 We determined the overall detector system cost for each scenario

and the component costs.

<P>

The light source is the largest cost driver in all scenarios studied;

the cost of the sensor is the next highest for the two 
low-production-rate

cases (the 6 and 20 sensors/vehicle cases at a production rate

of 5000 vehicles/year).  Costs could be reduced through the use

of a different light source like tungsten bulbs, which produce

light within the same wavelength range as halogen bulbs.  This

issue of determining the most economical light source within the

required light wavelength will be addressed with future experimentation

after the prototype is completed.  For the case of 6 sensors/vehicle

at 5000 vehicles/year, the light source is 49.2% of the total

cost, and the sensor is 17.3% of the total cost.  The largest

driver of the sensor cost is polishing and coating the fibers,

which is very labor-intensive, contributing 90-98% to the total

sensor cost.  However, each sensor will cost only $0.11-$2.34,

depending on the production rate.

<P>

The biggest issue to be addressed in regard to mass production

of coating the fiber ends will be in polishing the fibers.  For

the analysis, it was assumed that one polisher could polish 10

fibers at a time at a rate of 10 fibers per 30 minutes.  Currently

available polishers typically polish one fiber at a time to a

maximum of 12 at a time, a manually intensive process.  The fibers

would have to be placed into the connection(s) on the polisher

by a worker.  Also, the current polishing devices that polish

up to 12 fibers at a time need to be adapted to polishing bare

fibers rather than fibers in connectors.  This issue, along with

quality control, must be addressed in order for mass production

to be feasible.

<P>

A literature search was completed to determine the baseline costs

for carbon nanotubes to be competitive for on-board vehicle application.


 We compiled various container costs for currently tested and

potential hydrogen storage systems for on-board hydrogen storage

systems.  The total fuel system needs to be taken into account

as well as the amount of usable hydrogen from the storage system

when determining which system will be the most economical, since

all of the hydrogen contained in the storage system will not be

available for use.  For instance, liquid hydrogen systems will

lose some hydrogen to boil-off; compressed hydrogen systems, including

glass microspheres, can only utilize the gas that is at or above

the pressure of the fuel cell system; and cryoadsorption, nanotube

storage, and hydride systems will adsorb more hydrogen than can

be released though dehydrogenation.

<P>

The first cut at an economic analysis for an algal hydrogen producing

system was completed.  We studied the two-pond system, using 
CO<sub>2</sub>

capture and recycle.  A 10% yield (HHV H<sub>2</sub> out / sunlight in) 
was

assumed, and spent algae was sold as a lipids by-product.  For

a 24-tonne-per-day H<sub>2</sub> production capacity, the calculated 
selling

price of hydrogen was $15.50/GJ.  This cost is at the plant gate,

without compression or storage.  The parameter having the largest

influence on cost is yield.  If a 20% yield can be achieved (as

with E. Greenbaum's organism) and all other parameters remain

constant, the necessary hydrogen selling price can be reduced

to about $10/GJ.
