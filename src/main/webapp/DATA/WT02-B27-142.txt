<h2>Limitations of the Best Interests and Substituted Judgement standards</h2>
<h3>Chris Docker<BR><BR>A brief argument to suggest that the law’s current mechanisms for making decisions about incompetent persons are inadequate.
</h3>

</CENTER>
<HR>


<h4>Introduction</h4>

The law has attempted, and continues to attempt to provide, a stopgap for certain socio-medical shortcomings. For a competent adult patient, the law, medicine and ethics are in agreement about only proceeding with treatment which is acceptable to that patient . Whether we argue from a utilitarian viewpoint to maximise the greatest good for the greatest number, or whether we present a Kantian or duties-based argument, the result is largely uncontroversial. In the case of the incompetent patient, however, I hope to suggest that existing mechanisms are inadequate, even if they are the best that can be offered from a legal context.

<BR><BR>The American system relies heavily on the substituted judgement standard.(1,6,15,19) The system, which is some 15 years old, seeks to identify a surrogate to make the decision that the patient would have made - <cite>putting oneself in the patient’s shoes</cite> as it were. It relies and falls on the premiss that the surrogate knows something of the patient’s preferences as expressed when the patient’s decision-making capacity was intact. The fallacy of such an assumption is demonstrated by a large number of studies(10,14,16,22) and, although it still has heavy support in law, there is little controversy about the inability of surrogates to make substituted judgements. For instance, in studies of paired patients and nominated proxies, even though 90 per cent of patients predicted that family menbers would accurately predict their wishes, those family members were unable accurately to do so. Doctors fared no better, although doctors who had been well acquainted with their patients over a long period of time - something that rarely happens now - fared very slightly better.

<BR><BR>If family members, courts and doctors are unable to guess or ascertain what a patient would have wanted, there is no rationale for the substituted judgement standard.
Notwithstanding this, the English Law Commission is seeking legislation for Continuing Powers of Attorney that would encourage such proxy decision making.(17)

<BR><BR>But before turning to what I believe might be acceptable, if partial, alternatives, I will briefly examine the main standard of decision-making for incompetents in use on the UK - that of <citeBest Interests</cite>.

<BR><BR>The best interests standard asks the surrogate to decide the course of action that promotes the patient’s interests according to what most reasonable persons would choose.(15) The English Law Commission is sensibly attempting to widen this formally, to include any evidence of the patient’s expressed preferences.(17)

<BR><BR>Unfortunately, few people express such preferences in advance,(5) or express them clearly enough, or express preferences that are applicable to the circumstances that arise. Hence we have the choice of making weighty decisions on the flimsiest of evidence, or of making decisions based on what we might falsely assume any reasonable person would want. Of those cases where express preferences have been made known in advance, such preferences are frequently ignored.(5) Studies demonstrate that not only do patients preferences vary very considerably for given treatments but that medical bias(3) influences which treatments are given or withdrawn.

<BR><BR>Attempting to reinforce such flimsy mechanisms with legal protocols will not better equip them to perform the function for which they are intended and will, in the end, only further cloud the issues. Just as a case can be over-medicalised, by treatment of the disease and symptoms, in isolation from the patient as an individual with individual preferences and circumstances, so can legalism, by applying rules that may be inappropriate in an individual circumstance, hinder rather than help the execution of justice and good medical practice; formal rules based on inadequate assumptions should instill us to find better answers rather than mere acceptance of those rules.(12)

<BR><BR>The two Standards fall principally on the practical difficulty in obtaining sufficient evidence of patient preferences, whether actual or that of the supposed <cite>reasonable patient</cite>. If such information could be obtained, either standard could perhaps be made to work, but as that would rely on the advance cooperation of all patients it is not likely to happen. Given that some patients will, however, cooperate, there is no need to discard such standards, only to improve their workability whilst simultaneously developing mechanisms to take the pressure off these over-used devices.(21) I would like to present some short proposals for such mechanisms.
<BR><BR><BR>
<h4>Proposals</h4>

1.Institutional guidelines on specific situations

<BR><BR>2.Transparency of resource allocation

<BR><BR>3.Empathy and compassion as tools of the nurse advocate

<BR><BR>4.Development of a family-based ethic

<BR><BR>5.Preferences derived from communities of patients


<BR><BR><BR>
<h4>Institutional guidelines on specific situations</h4>
Modern technology has brought with it a range of associated problems such as PVS and the applicability of CPR or antibiotics in dementia. Developing medical ethics has sought to emphasise patient autonomy as the main or sole criterion for decision-making, extending this principle by tortuous devices into the area of decision making for the incompetent adult.(2) This has perhaps contributed to lack of development of contiguous mechanisms that might be ethically viable. The debate on PVS, while far from concluded, has brought diagnosis to the level where, in some cases, it is known with certainty that the brain is destroyed and no medical treatment can restore it or any quality of life. Continuing treatment not only may be construed as an affront to dignity, whether the dignity afforded to a person or a corpse, but will, if we are talking about NHS resources, inevitably result in reduction of medical treatments available to other patients. At the moment, such decisions to stop treatment in PVS can only be taken by a court - again, involving an even further drain on the sorely pressed public purse. The process of decisionmaking through consultation in Scotland has given way to formal court hearings, which in turn attempt to invoke a best interest standard. I submit it could be better developed by means of institutional guidelines developed by the professional associations. Guidelines could be developed for other conditions as well as PVS where the patient’s preference is no longer the most relevant factor.(8)



<BR><BR><BR>
<h4>Transparency of resource allocation</h4>
I won’t attempt in this essay to consider what I believe to be an inadequate system of resource allocation in this country, but will mention for consideration what I see to be a great danger to equitable decisionmaking - the lack of transparency in health care resource allocation. We need to stop the lie of infinite resources for any need that is deemed great enough - there is no way that such resources can be found. But we have a duty to make the decisionmaking process more open. Patients need to know what they can reasonably expect and also what they can not reasonably expect the public purse to provide. They need to know the limitations and inadequacies of hospitals and the decisionmaking and resource allocation processes, and come to terms with them. When we have done this as a society, we may also be able to pave the way for change in this area. Even if the best interests of a patient can be ascertained, there may be insufficient funding available to serve them. Instead of pouring so much effort into desperately trying to discover what the patient would want and then presenting the harsh disappointment of reality, it might be more equitable to present the availability of choices and then encourage development of patient autonomy within the scenario of those practically available options.

<BR><BR><BR>
<h4>Empathy and compassion as the tools of the nurse advocate</h4>
Over-reliance on science and social science is at the root of much of the failure of the best interests and substituted judgement standards. Studies have suggested that compassion is a necessary fuel for insight and effective information gathering concerning the patient and factors that might affect decisions regarding that patient. Compassion heightens our awareness of a situation(4) though without, of itself, helping us to form better moral judgements.(18) Nurses are ideally placed to utilize compassion a)because of their increased contact with patients and significant others, b)because more nurses are women and studies have suggested an increased capacity for compassion in women, and c)the nurse’s institutionalised role as patient advocate(7) - and I note that it might be necessary to accord more formal recognition of this role.

<BR><BR>The nurse advocate might potentially be able to give a broader based picture than could otherwise be obtained. Within a best interests framework even, the nurse might better be able to provide the necessary information, but the advantage of developing this platform over reliance on the law of best interests, is that it allows greater flexibility to consider the context of information, short of court hearings, and were legislation to become overly prescriptive, better flexibility than even the courts.

<BR><BR><BR>
<h4>Development of a family-based ethic</h4>
The best that medical practice currently aspires to in its ethical decisionmaking is respect for the autonomy of the patient within a doctor-patient relationship. While it is a necessary basis(21) from which to start, it is severely limited, and its lack of practical development contributes in no small part to the unfairness which best interest and substituted judgement standards are forced at times to perpetrate. Family members and significant others, whether healthy or ill, have their own autonomy which needs to be respected.(13) Community morality may also have a valid part to play. Family and community may have to bear the brunt of medical decisions about an individual when that patient is discharged from hospital or kept in. Such considerations suggest that decisionmaking should be broader based than focussing exclusively on the patient’s supposed autonomy. Legal requirements of best interests and substituted judgement make no allowance for this and may also fail to serve the patient well. The nurse advocate is again ideally placed to develop such an ethic, as long as we do not over-medicalise that profession as we have done with the doctor’s. While the patient is the chief player in the drama, recognition that medical decisions should not be taken in isolation from non-medical factors and persons other than the patient is also fundamental.(11,13,20)

<BR><BR><br>
<h4>Preferences derived from communities of patients</h4>
Finally, in identifying patient preferences, undue weight may be given to the unexpressed or expressed wishes of the patient. It is well established that patients often make poor decisions on the basis of inadequate understanding; it is also well-established that their treatment preferences frequently change with increased understanding. Most patients express no advance preferencesfor treatment in incompetency(5) and identifying applicable preferences may place quite unreasonable weight on dubious information. The practicality of getting all patients to provide adequate and well-informed treatment preferences in advance of incompetency may be impossible, beyond our resources as a nation, or an undue invasion of competent persons’ willingness to consider and provide such information. A well-considered default position is therefore necessary. What we do know is that specific groups of patients tend to make similar decisions.(5) Such population groups might, for instance, turn out to include long term nursing home residents in a certain age band. As concordance within a group might not be 100 per cent we have to acknowledge the imperfect nature of such a default, but it is less imperfect than most of the current attempts to devolve decisions to surrogates. The initial research to identify preferences of specific communities of patients would be financially and ethically justified by its long term contribution to a solution. By comparison, the present attempts to strain the limits of substituted judgement and best interests are like wet earth in the holes of a dyke.

<UL>The SUBSTITUTED JUDGEMENT standard asks the surrogate to make the decision that the patient would have made in the particular situation. This standard is limited by the fact that the surrogate must know something about the patient’s prefernces, as expressed when the patient’s decision-making capacity was intact. On the other hand, the BEST INTERESTS standard is invoked when the patient’s preferences were unknown. This standard, by definition, cannot apply to the patient’s preferences. Instead it seeks the surrogate to choose the course of action that promotes the patient’s interests according to a more impersonal standard (e.g. that which most reasonable persons would choose).</UL>

<UL>p.162 The possibility of patients inadvertantly misdirecting their doctors by an inadequate appreciation of the circumstances or of the evolution of new treatments led the Association to recommend strongly that advance directives should not be legally binding on doctors, but legal cases in 1992 and 1993 indicated that an anticipatory decision which is clearly established and applicable to the circumstances would be as legally binding as any current decision made by a competent patient. (Cases referred to are Re T [1992]4 All ER 649; and Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993]1 All ER 859.)

<BR><BR>p.164 The precise role, powers and title of a proxy decision-maker are not defined by either custom or law (even in Scotland where tutors dative may exercise this role). Pending clarification in law, the BMA believes that in cases where such a person has been nominated by the patient, the criterion to be followed in decision-making would be that of <cite>substituted judgement,</cite> with the agent as a sympathetic interpreter of the patient’s own values, rather than attempting to judge the patient’s best interests.</UL>

<BR><BR>3.Christakis N, Asch D. Biases in How Physicians Choose to Withdraw Life Support. Lancet 1993; 42:642-646.

<UL>p.642 Physicians do have preferences about the form of life support withdrawn. From most likely to least likely the order is: blood products, haemodialysis, intravenous vasopressors, total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, tube feedings, and intravenous fluids.

<BR><BR>p.642 Four biases in decision making were also identified. Physicians prefer to withdraw forms of therapy supporting organs that failed for natural rather iatrogenic reasons, to withdraw recently instituted rather than longstanding interventions, to withdraw forms of therapy resulting in immediate death rather than delayed death, and to withdraw forms of therapy when confronted with diagnostic uncertainty.

<BR><BR>p.642 Because these biases may have clinical, social, and ethical consequences counter to patient goals, and because they may affect the underlying decision whether to withdraw life support at all, they may represent impediments to rational and compassionate decision making on critical care.

<BR><BR>p.645 Our research shows that physicians’ preferences about the type of life support to withdraw are influenced by iatrogenic complications, duration of therapy with each form of life support, expected timing of death, and diagnostic uncertainty.

<BR><BR>p.645 The decision biases that we have identified here may, in some circumstances, prolong the period of dying, increase the suffering of patients and their families, and waste resources.

<BR><BR>p.645 Should, therefore, advance directives be drafted to specify how life support could be withdrawn? We think not: rather than seek such specificity physicians should focus on the underlying goals.

<BR><BR>p.645 The primary goal in life support withdrawal ordinarily is to allow the patient to die as humanely as possible, and the decision should be made in the most ethically sensitive, logically rigorous, and clinically appropriate way possible. The biases we have identified may subvert this objective.</UL>

Second, knowing the patient’s wishes well, the proxy will make <CITE>the decision that the incompetent patient would make if he or she were competent.</cite> The proxy decision maker is justified in exercising the incompetent patient’s right to refuse care to the extent that he or she can <cite>don the mental mantle</cite> or <cite>stand in the shoes</cite> of the patient and make the same decisions under the circumstances that the patient would. In legal doctrine, this is called substituted judgement.</UL>

<UL>p.524 We found a significant number of cases in which healthcare providers at a long-term care facility came into conflict with surrogates because the treatment desired by the surrogate was viewed as excessively burdonsome when evaluated by an experienced team of nurses, physicians, and social workers. Neither a court-appointed guardian nor an institutional ethics committee were likely to be able to resolve these conflicts because of lack of clarity about what constitutes the best interest of impaired nursing home patients.

<BR><BR>p.527 The solution to the dilemma is to develop institutional policies within longterm care facilities that would restrict the scope of treatment decisions made by proxies. Policies would be derived from the experience of a broad spectrum of nursing home staff... caring for patients with severe dementia. They would delineate what constituted an acceptable level of care designed to promote the comfort and well- being of demented patients. Within the context of care plan outlines that insured the goal of patient comfort, proxies would participate in the implementation of specific therapies based on thier view of the importance of the goal of life prolongation.

<UL>p.22 For millenia, medical ethics has focussed on the doctor-patient relationship. Thus the SUPPORT trial to improve clinical decisionmaking for seriously ill patients can be viewed as a report about the failure of this dyadic relationship. ...physicians who are so unconcerned about patient preferences that they don’t even bother to look at them when they’re placed in the chart, and patients who do not take advantage of opportunities to discuss their treatment preferences with their physicians.

<BR><BR>p.23 We must also recognize that families are not simply or even primarily <cite>patient support systems.</cite> They must not be thought of or treated that way by doctors, hospitals, health care planners, or bioethicists. To do so is immoral, as Kant made plain. It involves treating the rest of the patient’s family as mere means to the preferences of the patient. 

<BR><BR>p.24 Treatment decisions that respect and enhance the autonomy of the patient may at the same time disregard and shatter the autonomy of the patient’s caregivers and the rest of her family.</UL>

<UL>p.21 ...the reservations we have about interested family members and their proxy decisions are partly of our own making. The accepted theory of proxy decisions is deeply flawed and must be recast. Our medical practice is, I believe, often better than the conventional theories of proxy decision making. Nonetheless, some of our deepest worries about proxy decision making grow out of the morally inappropriate instructions we give them.

<BR><BR>p.26 ...we must provide guidance and support for those caught in the moral crucible of proxy decisions. Not only would this approach be more ethically sound, but it would, I believe, decrease the number of inappropriate proxy decisions.</UL>

<UL>p.5 The prevalent ethic of patient autonomy ignores family interests in medical treatment decisions. Acknowledging these interests as legitimate forces basic changes in ethical theory and the moral practice of medicine.

<BR><BR>p.10 Our present ethical theory can only condemn as unethical any attempt to weigh in the interests of other family members. If we would acknowledge the moral relevance of the interests of the family we could perhaps develop an ethical theory that would guide and support physicians, patients, and families in the throes of agonisiong moral decisions.</UL>

<UL>p.173 With In re Quinlan (1976), it was argued that the constitutionally protected right to die could be exercised by a family on behalf of an incompetent patient as long as the family could establish that its decision was consistent with the decision the incompetent principal would make if able to do so. This knowledge might include understandings about the principal’s religious beliefs, general attitudes regarding medical care, and other substantial (albeit indirect) evidence of that person’s frame of mind with regard to right-to-die issues. ... This reasoning would become known as the <cite>substituted judgement</cite> standard, which holds that a third party’s best guess about the wishes of the incompetent patient could be substituted for that which was impossible to obtain: the expressed wishes of the patient.

<BR><BR>p.173 The term substituted judgement actually originates with the Massachusetts case In re Spring (1980). In this case, the court decided that a seventy-eight-year-old incompetent individual with end-stage kidney disease could forgo hemodialysis, based on what was known about the individual’s general preferences in such matters. No written or specific oral instructions would be required as long as the principal’s predisposition toward the withdrawal of life support could be reasonably demonstrated by a third party.

<BR><BR>p.173-4 The <cite>Best Interests</cite> Standard. In another important Massachusettes case, Superintendant of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz (1977), the court seemed to expand the coverage of the constitutionally protected right-to-die beyond those who were currently incompetent to those who had never been legally competent. Joseph Saikewicz, the principal in this case, had been mentally retarded since birth. But the Massachusettes court hearing the case presumed that those who knew him could reasonably determine what his wishes might be, even though he himself had never been legally competent to make such decisions on his own behalf. Extending the Quinlan rationale to Saikewicz was something of a stretch for the substituted-judgement standard, however, leading the Saikewicz court to introduce the notion that other factors might be considered, including age (Saikewicz was sixty-seven), the pain associated with continued therapy, the chances for therapeutic success, the suffering associated with the continuation of life, and the inability to cooperate with therapy when in a degraded mental state. This move to consideration of other factors broadened the realm of possibilities for those seeking to establish the right to die, and in the process, it laid the groundwork for what would become a second kind of test: the <cite>best-interests</cite> standard, a term that was actually not coined until the New Jersey court heard the case of Claire Conroy five years later.</UL>
