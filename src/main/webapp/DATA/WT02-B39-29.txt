NEW CALIFORNIA ACTION SEEKS RESCISSION OF PRU PARTNERSHIP RESIDUALS

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   A group of California investors has sued Prudential Securities, claiming
that the firm's continuing residual payments to brokers and former Direct
Investment Group executives has perpetuated its allegedly deceptive limited
partnership sales practices.
   The group, which brought its case in California Superior Court in
Sacramento County, is also demanding rescission of both the residual
payments and its members' limited partnership investments because the firm
failed to disclose financial incentives for brokers to sell the funds.
   Among former high-ranking Prudential Securities executives receiving
residual payments is James Darr, the former head of the firm's Direct
Investment Group, who has frequently been mentioned during investigations
of the firm's partnership problems. According to published reports, Darr
has received more than $2 million in partnership residuals.
   ``We're saying that the fraud was not over and done with at the time of
the sales,'' said Allan Haley, one of three lawyers representing the group.
``Every day Prudential pays residuals is a continuation.''
Prudential has responded to the claim and a hearing on that response is
scheduled for Jan. 30.
   The plaintiffs have petitioned the court to enjoin and restrain
Prudential from ``making or receiving'' further residual payments without
first making full disclosure of each contractual obligation currently in
effect and offering to rescind each contract for the sale of a Prudential
direct investment made in California.
   The suit also is seeking to rescind each limited partnership sale made
after Sept. 1, 1982, and force Prudential ``to account for and to disgorge
the profits made through its unlawful and unfair business acts and
practices in California.'' The investors made their partnership purchases
between 1983 and 1987.
   The foundation of the suit is in a California statute stating any
financial interests a broker has in a security must be disclosed prior to
the transaction. Unless the broker notifies the client of the existence of
the financial interest, a client has a right to cancel the transaction.
   ``Not disclosed in any offering document or sales communication directed
to any plaintiff or other purchaser was the fact that the registered
representative of PSI making such sale had been given by PSI an
indeterminate, open-ended participation in the cash flow, earnings,
refinancing and distribution rights held by the PSI affiliate involved in
that PSI partnership,'' according to the plaintiffs' filing.
   The suit also includes a 1982 memo from former Prudential CEO George
Ball that states: ``Starting September 1st, 50% of Bache's net earnings
from Tax Investment Group programs, from which Bache Properties, Bache
Energy, or Bache Leasing subsequently earns asset residuals interests
and/or cash flow, will be paid to Account Executives who sell $25,000 of
any such offering.''
   Prudential's response said the plaintiffs' claims are made beyond the
statute of limitations, coming eight years after their initial investments,
that the California laws under which the claim is filed is pre-empted by
Federal statutes, and that the state's Business and Professional code is
not applicable to securities transactions based on a similar 1988 ruling in
Hawaii.
   San Francisco law firm Steefel, Levitt & Weiss is representing
Prudential in the case.

MEGA-PRODUCER LANYI LANDS AT OPCO'S MIDTOWN BRANCH

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   Andrew Lanyi, author, radio show host, and $4 million-producer, last
week agreed to bring his team to Oppenheimer & Co.'s Midtown Manhattan
office from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., branch manager Jordan Berlin
confirmed.
   At Ladenburg, Lanyi operated his team as a self-contained unit, Andrew
Lanyi Research Inc., but he will join Oppenheimer as a senior vp. He will
continue to publish his own research and follow what he terms ``tomorrow's
blue chips,'' undervalued, under-followed stocks.
   Lanyi's 10-person team is comprised of three brokers, one full-time
analyst, and other support staff. Berlin described Lanyi as the ``most
organized, hardest-working broker I've ever known.''
   In addition to his brokerage work, Lanyi, a Holocaust survivor who
arrived in the United States penniless, has a radio show on New York's WEVD
and has written a book, ``Confessions of a Stockbroker.''
   One national headhunter said Lanyi, who was at Lehman Brothers before
Ladenburg, was among the most sought-after brokers on the recruiting
scene.

NYSE MEMBERS FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE SEATS AS PRICES SOAR

By:
Heike Wipperfurth

   While the NYSE is ringing out 1995 on many record notes, floor brokers
and specialists are beginning to feel the heat as prices of membership
leases on the Big Board are reaching a new high, making it more difficult
for some to afford the cost as demand remains strong, sources said.
   While some NYSE participants seem eager to pay higher prices for
membership privileges on the world's largest equities market, others are
unwilling or unable to pay up, and drop out, sources said.
   Attorney James Rothenberg said that he had unfilled demand from a
specialist and a floor broker wanting to purchase a lease on a seat at an
annual cost of $150,000 each, up from recent lease prices of between
$130,000 and $140,000. Prices are typically negotiated between the lessee
and the lessor as a private agreement and the NYSE does not get involved,
an NYSE spokeswoman said.
   Demand for seat leasing is skyrocketing because of the recent rise in
trading volume and the positive direction of the market, Rothenberg said.
   Sources said that about 740, or more than half of the 1,366 seats on the
Big Board, have been leased. The rise in demand for the limited amount of
seats creates major problems for some members, sources said.
   ``It's definitely a problem. It's hard to get a lease,'' a source said.
A lot of specialists, he noted, are trying to lock in costs by paying
premium prices for two-year leases. They are afraid that next year's prices
may be even higher, he said. As a result, some two-dollar brokers are not
able to make it and they drop out, he noted.
   The high prices for seat leases reflect record prices for seat sales,
sources noted. One source predicted that a seat soon could go for as much
as $1.15 million up from the last seat sale at $1,05 million in December.
   At the end of 1995, the Big Board's market capitalization reached $6
trillion. There were 2,675 NYSE-listed companies with 155.2 billion shares
available on the exchange, according to statistics from the Federation of
International Stock Exchanges.

LAWYERS FIGHTING OVER ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN NASDAQ ANTITRUST SUIT

By:
Heike Wipperfurth

   Lawyers on both sides of the antitrust suit involving 33 of the biggest
Nasdaq market makers filed court motions in December accusing the other
side of not providing enough documents, sources said.
   The bickering between the opposing sides will be carried into the court
room for a hearing on January 17 before Judge Robert Sweet in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, an attorney said.
   Defendants' lawyers filed a motion in late December requesting more
documents relating to how `class' was defined by the plaintiff lawyers, he
said. Plaintiffs' lawyers, on the other hand, are fighting for additional
access to documents and tape recordings and are asking for permission to
confer with the Justice Department, he noted.
   Both sides think that they do not have everything they are entitled to,
he said. This is ``the typical bickering over how much paper each side is
going to produce at the beginning of a big case,'' he added.
   In addition, the source said that Judge Sweet has to make a decision on
a motion filed by the Los Angeles Times in December, requesting, among
other things, that the court break its confidentiality order and provide
access to the tapes and other material handed over to the plaintiff lawyers
by the defendants.
   The antitrust suit accusing major Nasdaq market makers of collusion,
price fixing and overpricing was filed after an academic study brought to
public attention of indirect evidence of implicit collusion among market
makers.

PRU'S FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MANAGER MOVES TO NASHVILLE

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   Mike Baker, Prudential Securities' former San Francisco branch manager,
last week moved to Nashville to take over the firm's branch in the city,
sources said.
   Baker was dismissed from his San Francisco manager's post in late 1994
for what appeared to be compliance-related problems (SW, 7 Nov. '94, 4). At
that time, Baker had been expected to take the helm of the consolidated
office made up of Prudential's two metro San Francisco offices. That branch
is the firm's largest nationwide.
   Since leaving the managerial position, Baker has continued working for
Prudential as an internal auditor.
   Ironically, Nashville manager Rick Hertz was recently dismissed for
compliance-related problems in that same office.

DEBATE REMAINS ON RULES TO ENSURE BEST EXECUTION FOR MULTIPLE TRADED
OPTIONS

   A letter submitted recently to the SEC by the Committee On Options
Proposals concerning the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's so-called ``Trade or
Send'' rule for multiple traded options, indicates that a split remains
within the industry on how to ensure the best execution of trades entered.
   The letter, while noting that the COOP ``has [previously] endorsed
[Phlx's] filing in principal,'' also indicated that it ``has received
little or no support from the other exchanges.''
Under Phlx's proposed rule, which was submitted as the exchange's proposal
to ensure that customers receive the best offered price on an option at all
times, when a market maker or specialist at another exchange makes a better
bid than his counterpart at another exchange where the order was first
submitted, the order would automatically be sent to the exchange making a
better market.
   Part of the Phlx rule also requires that public customer orders be
designated as ``Principal Acting as Agent,'' or PA orders, to differentiate
them from trades submitted by institutional customers. However, sources
said, that rule provision has led to some market makers and specialists
refusing to honor posted prices for anything other than small customer
orders.
   Previously, a majority of the industry had instead supported, and still
support, a so-called ``Trade or Fade'' rule, which allows market makers and
specialists to match a better bid, or to contact his counterpart at the
other exchange to negotiate the price. Then, if the market maker or
specialist making the better bid decides not to deal with his counterpart
he can withdraw (fade) the bid.
   While the Trade or Fade rule has been used up until now, the COOP noted
in its letter to the SEC that several exchanges have indicated that ``their
market-makers/specialists match the Best Bid/Offer (BBO) [only] 93% of the
time they receive options orders that are eligible for automated
execution.''
Although the COOP called the results ``a commendable feat,'' it also
indicated that ``the member firm community is very concerned about the
portion of the remaining 7% who do not obtain the BBO.''
   The Trade or Fade rule, the COOP added, is by it nature limited in
addressing the problem, and it added that in any case ``it has been
reported that some trading crowds are not honoring Trade or Fade
procedures.''
Phlx's rule would seem to solve the problem, but the COOP noted in its
letter that the nation's other four options exchange don't support it.
   In the past, the other exchanges have argued that to properly implement
a Trade or Send rule a fully automated linkage system would need to be
developed, something that was originally part of an overall plan for the
multiple trading environment but that was abandoned as too costly before
multiple listing was imposed on the entire market for new listings.
   As a compromise, Phlx's rule was supported in principal with the
provision that the exchange make various adjustments, but sources indicated
that many COOP members now regret the endorsement.
   For its part, the SEC has not been pressuring the exchanges extensively
to accept a standardized rule, probably because the BBO has occurred in the
vast majority of cases. With competition for new listings heating up,
though, the agency could begin to push the industry more strongly.
   Previously the regulator delayed a vote on any rule regarding the issue
until December of last year, allowing a November deadline to pass. The
current government shutdown followed, so the agency has yet to act and it's
unclear when it will be able to do so.
   In the meantime, the COOP has scheduled a meeting for this Saturday for
industry representatives to discuss the issue, along with some other
issues. Among the topics to be discussed will be whether to reconsider the
development of a linkage system to determine if it would be ``economically
feasible.''
   Separately, The Options Industry Council, an educational and
informational group comprised of the nation's options exchanges and The
Options Clearing Corp., last week reported that equity options volume
reached an all-time high in 1995, with 174.4 million contracts changing
hands, surpassing the previous record, set in 1987, by 6%.

NASD SEEKS NEW BROKER/DEALER COMPENSATION LIMITS ON MUTUAL FUND AND
VARIABLE CONTRACT SECURITIES

   The NASD is seeking SEC approval to amend its Rules of Fair Practice to
limit the use of ``cash and non-cash compensation received by
broker/dealers who sell mutual funds and variable contract securities.''
   The NASD said the amendments would ``tighten and broaden existing rules
on the sale of these investment products,'' and added that they were
proposed ``in response to the increased use of non-cash compensation and
certain types of incentive-based cash compensation for the sale of
investment company and variable contract securities.''
   Such practices, the NASD said, ``may heighten the potential for a
member's loss of supervisory control over sales practices and increase the
possibility of the perception of impropriety,'' resulting in a loss of
investor confidence.
   Broadly, the new rule amendments would do the following:
   -- Prohibit, except under certain circumstances, broker/dealers from
receiving any cash or non-cash compensation from anyone other than the NASD
member with which the individual is associated.
   -- Require that NASD members maintain records of compensation received
from an investment company, an adviser to an investment company, a fund
administrator, an underwriter and any affiliated person.
   -- Prohibit receipt by a broker of cash compensation in connection with
the sale of investment company securities, unless the arrangement is
described in the current prospectus.
   -- Retain the prohibition, only with respect to the Investment Company
Rule, against a broker receiving compensation in the form of securities.
   -- Prohibit, with some exceptions, NASD members and associated persons
from accepting, directly or indirectly, any non-cash compensation in
connection with the sale of investment company and variable contract
securities.
   -- Prohibit, again with certain exceptions, an associated person from
accepting cash sales incentives for the sale of investment company or
variable contract securities.
   Separately, the NASD has also submitted new rules to the SEC designed to
eliminate potential confusion by investors purchasing mutual funds and
similar products on the premises of banks, savings and loans, credit unions
and other financial institutions other than broker/dealers.
   The new rule would require NASD member firms, among other things, to
conduct business in a location distinct from the area where retail deposits
are taken whenever possible; provide customers with a written document
outlining differences in insurance coverage and risks for securities and
institution deposits; and prohibit member firms from making payments,
including referral fees, to individuals employed by the financial
institution who are not registered with the member firm.

S.W.I.F.T. LAUNCHES NEW TRADE INITIATION AND CONFIRMATION MESSAGES TO
IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND TIMELINESS

   S.W.I.F.T. announced that it has made available new securities messages
for trade initiation and confirmation on its global network that it said
would ``significantly improve the efficiency and timeliness of confirming
trades as the industry globally moves towards shorter settlement cycles.''
Using the messages will allow S.W.I.F.T. customers to issue settlement
instructions through the same window as trade confirmations, resulting, the
firm said, in ``greater straight-through processing and single-window links
to trade counterparties.''
   The new messages will allow customers to more easily process their
trades automatically end-to-end, the firm said, adding that in the United
Kingdom regulators and tax authorities have approved accepting the
confirmation messages as electronic contract notes, meaning they can be
used to confirm trades without the need for a paper copy.
   The first users of the new messages, the firm said, will include The
Hong Kong Securities Industry Group, which will also ``be piloting the new
messages in conjunction with connection to the New York Depository Trust
Co.
   S.W.I.F.T. added that the new messages can be used in conjunction with
existing securities order and confirmation messages, which are slated to be
removed from the network in November of this year.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

The Department of the Treasury said it would continue to work with Congress
to determine whether additional ``transitional relief'' should be granted
on a recent proposal to deny or defer interest deductions of certain
financial instruments that have become popular on the Street. Under current
transitional relief already granted by Treasury most such instruments
registered with the SEC on or before Dec. 7 will not be subject to the
proposals.

FIMAT HIRES S&P FUTURES BROKER GROUP FROM LIT TO EXPAND PRESENCE

By:
Michael Ocrant

   Fimat, the futures sales and clearing division of Societe Generale
Group, hired a group of about 10 broker professionals to execute business
on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, mostly in S&P 500
contracts traded at the exchange, from LIT, a division of First Options of
Chicago.
   The group, headed by Luke Adrian, will also conduct some trading in the
Eurodollar pit at the Merc, sources said.
   Previously the group operated as an independent futures commission
merchant prior to becoming a division of LIT, sources said, adding that it
will remain a division of Fimat.
   Sources said the firm views the new hires as a way to add to its current
business profile and to meet the expected demand from clients for broker
execution services, particularly in the equity index area.
   Sources said the firm also hopes that the addition of the group will
raise Fimat's profile at the exchange and in general.
   Because of the steep rise in equity markets last year, sources said,
there is an expectation at Fimat that there will be significant activity
this year as investors seek to hedge their positions or to speculate on
market moves.
   While Fimat had several employees handling the business on the floor of
the CME, sources said, the expected business in the coming year required
that the firm be ``reasonably well prepared'' to manage any surge by
bringing on board dedicated and experienced brokers capable of meeting all
customer needs.

LIFFE OUTLINES 1996 STRATEGIC PLANS SET FORTH LAST YEAR

   The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has
outlined a number of strategic developments to help ensure that it retains
the position as the leading futures and options exchange outside of Chicago
and to further its worldwide market penetration throughout the coming
year.
   Cited first by the exchange was the linkage agreement between Liffe and
the Chicago Board of Trade, which was formally signed just last month after
months of prior negotiations.
   Liffe noted that the linkage will provide market users with increased
access to major government debt futures and options products on both sides
of the Atlantic during U.S. and European business hours. Initially, the
linkage will include Liffe's German government bond (bund) contract and the
CBT's U.S. Treasury bond contract, which are scheduled to begin trading in
the second quarter of this year.
   Next, the exchange said, in April of this year it will commence another
linkage with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange that, under
an agreement signed last year, will begin the trading of a fungible
three-month Euroyen futures contract.
   Also slated for this year is a merger between Liffe and the London
Commodity Exchange, which the exchange said will be the first step in
``providing a platform for the development of a liquid European time zone
agricultural and soft commodity complex in London.''
   In an effort to maintain a leading technological edge, Liffe noted that
this month it would launch its APT trading system for options, a move it
said would create the first fully functional screen-based options trading
system in the world.
   Other technological initiatives, the exchange said, include the
development of its so-called LOTS system, designed to provide the
industry's first comprehensive electronic business processing system, and
the development of an unnamed automated system for its equity options
complex.
   Finally, the exchange noted that an agreement has been reached with
London Stock Exchange for Liffe to lease the LSE's former trading floor,
office and storage space, which will allow it to meet its medium-term
needs.
   Like other exchanges around the world last year, Liffe suffered a drop
in volume compared with the prior record year, but still had its second
busiest year ever. The exchange indicated that the various initiatives it
has in store for 1996 will help it continue to grow.
