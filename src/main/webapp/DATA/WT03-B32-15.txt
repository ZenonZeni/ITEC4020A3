CD-ROM MOVIEBOOK FROM SOUND SOURCE
INTERACTIVE RUNS UNDER WINDOWS

Babe, that cute little irrepressible pig and summer-movie
sensation, is fresh from his adventures on the big screen and
ready to take children on an exciting romp through the world
of interactive edutainment. Babe is making his MovieBook debut
in an irresistible CD-ROM-based storybook from Sound Source
Interactive that enables kids from three and up to learn while
having fun. Universal City Studios, the motion-picture studio
that brought Babe to the movie screen, joined with Sound
Source Interactive to bring the hit-movie sensation to the
computer screen.

Sound Source Interactive's series of MovieBooks package
turns today's most popular family films into creative and
interactive learning experiences. "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A
Long Way" is the latest title from the creative group that
brought "Black Beauty," "The Secret Garden," "The Little
Rascals" and "Lassie" to CD-ROMs and computers everywhere.

On retail shelves in time for Thanksgiving, Babe is an
interactive CD-ROM that features a 52-page storybook complete
with text, actual movie clips, photos, animation, sound
effects, games and puzzles. Mirroring the movie's plot, the
CD takes children on a multimedia journey into the magical
landscape of the little pig that could.

"With a simple click of the mouse, children can experience an
interactive adventure, from a pigs-eye view, while learning to
read and conducting activities that bring the fundamentals of
early education to life through imaginative and intuitive
interfaces," said Vincent Bitetti, CEO of Sound Source.

Bitetti explained that the goal of Sound Source Interactive's
MovieBooks is to educate while entertaining. "With Babe and
our other titles, our goal is to spark literacy, familiarize
kids with the computer, and create an educational focus within
a movie-going experience," he said. "Our MovieBooks promise to
hold a child's interest while offering quality educational
material."

Storybook Takes Children on Babe's Magical Journey

As children enter the world of Babe, they are led to Hoggett
farm and its magnificent barn by the famous trio of singing
mice from the movie. Entering the barn begins the adventure!
Children are presented with a myriad of options at this point.

Proceeding straight ahead takes them to a curio cabinet
filled with active objects and memorabilia, including the main
storybook. Children can also turn left, right or proceed
outside to a barnyard where a number of activities designed
to enhance critical and creative thinking skills await.

The main storybook is presented by clicking on the book in
the center of the curio cabinet. Filled with 52 pages of text
accompanied by animations, movie clips, games and puzzles, the
storybook interactively tells the tale of Babe's magical
journey. Children can read the story themselves or chose the
narrative option which automatically takes pre-readers through
the story, triggering animations and movie clips on cue.

In the interactive mode, the last page of each chapter
presents children with a multiple-choice reading comprehension
quiz. A perfect score on the quiz rewards the child with a
puzzle piece. Fitting each chapter's puzzle piece together
reveals a completed puzzle picture which can be printed.

Variety of Activities Makes Learning Fun

In addition to the storybook, children can immerse themselves
in a variety of entertaining learning activities. These
activities have been specifically designed by Sound Source to
teach logic and reasoning skills while providing children
with loads of fun.

In Silly Skins, children are able to place "silly animal
skins" on each barnyard resident, painting ducks with stripes,
pigs with polka dots and horses with checks.

Among the wacky skin choices is the correct choice, teaching
children deductive reasoning by allowing them to reach a
logical conclusion of matching the correct skin with the
appropriate animal. Children also learn to understand the
relationship between objects along with creative thinking and
problem-solving skills.

Children can also create a barnyard scene, clicking and
dragging animals, trucks, buildings and fences into a
landscaped picture. Here the child learns creative thinking as
well as hand-eye coordination. A hidden puzzle is another fun
learning activity, certain to challenge and amuse any child.
By solving detailed dilemmas and searching for a host of
hidden objects in less than a minute, children again use
deductive reasoning, enabling them to reach a conclusion by
interpreting a series of clues.

Additional activities include a maze where children can help
Babe rescue sheep, a missing-pieces puzzle and a Kooky Coop
where children enter a chicken house and locate objects found
in each chicken's nest. Children can also make greeting cards
to print out and color.

Pricing and Availability

Available immediately, "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A Long Way"
has a suggested street price of $29.95. Babe and other Sound
Source Interactive MovieBooks are available at most major
retail outlets, including Comp USA, Egghead, K-Mart, Price-
Costco, Software Etcetera and other fine stores.

Sound Source Interactive MovieBooks play on any 386 33MHz, or
faster, IBM PC/compatible computer running Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95. The computer should be equipped with at least 8MB
RAM, a 256-color monitor, sound card and double-speed CD-ROM
drive.
