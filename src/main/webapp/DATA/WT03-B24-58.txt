Students entering the MS-SWSE program must have course work or equivalent
knowledge in the following areas: a modern, block-  structured programming
language such as Ada, C, or Pascal; data structures and algorithms; machine
organization, e.g., as given in computer system architecture or assembly language
courses; and topics in discrete mathematics including sets, relations, functions,
trees, graphs, and inductive proofs.  The level of knowledge required in these
areas is equivalent to that taught in undergraduate courses in the indicated
topics, and may also be achieved by taking the following George Mason University
courses, which are referred to as the SWSE foundation courses:

<DD> <A HREF = "foundreq.html">INFS 501</A> Discrete and Logical Structures for Information Systems
<DD> <A HREF = "foundreq.html">INFS 515</A> Computer Organization
<DD> <A HREF = "foundreq.html">INFS 590</A> Program Design and Data Structures
</DL>
<P>  
In addition, it is desirable, though not required, that entering students have
at least one year of work experience in building and/or modifying software
systems.
