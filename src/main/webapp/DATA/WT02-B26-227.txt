<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
By 1975, sufficient R&D had been accomplished in the United States and abroad to establish the technical feasibility of using maglev technology for mass transportation applications.  (In fact, the first U.S. patent for a maglev system suitable for transportation applications was granted earlier, in 1968.)  However, while the Germans and Japanese continued vigorous R&D on this technology, U.S. funding was discontinued after 1975.  By 1989-90, both Germany and Japan had achieved advanced stages in their maglev development programs, and both had prototype test vehicles running on test guideways.  But since no commercial maglev system was as yet deployed, there remained an opportunity for the United States to re-emerge as an international competitor.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Following publication of landmark maglev studies performed by U.S. Senator Moynihan's Technology Advisory Committee and Argonne National Laboratory in 1989, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and DOE, together with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, jointly formed the National Maglev Initiative (NMI) in FY 1990.  The program was initiated in part due to the growing concern that the demand for fast, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation was rapidly outpacing the existing system's capacity.

<P>
This federally funded project investigated the state of the art in maglev system design, developed U.S. maglev system design concepts, evaluated them relative to existing transportation systems, determined the economic feasibility of developing and implementing such systems in the United States, and examined what role the federal government should play in their development and implementation.
<P>
By the time the NMI was started in FY 1990, formation of a strong maglev technical team was already well under way at Argonne.  The team consisted of transportation experts, physicists, and electrical and mechanical engineers, one of whom had served as a project leader for the first federally funded maglev program in the early 1970s.  Funding from the Laboratory, the state of Illinois, and the DOE helped to build that team and its level of expertise in maglev technology.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
During subsequent years, Argonne made many contributions to the NMI program.  Argonne's maglev team produced more than 70 reports and papers and a number of invention disclosures from 1988-95. Five patents have been awarded, and a sixth application was recently submitted.
<P>
The Laboratory participated in various program planning, management, and coordinating committees and helped government agencies evaluate contractor proposals and monitor technical progress on awarded contracts.  In addition, through government-sponsored in-house R&D, the Argonne team, building on the earlier maglev work done in the United States and abroad, developed laboratory experimental techniques and used them to help develop new computer codes and validate both old and new codes.  Argonne's acquired expertise and analytical tools were then applied to verifying and evaluating contractors' results.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Federal support for the NMI was drastically reduced in FY 1994 and virtually eliminated in FY 1995.  Despite these actions, Argonne staff continue to work in the maglev field, although at a reduced level.  During FY 1994, both the Army Corps of Engineers and the FRA provided support to Argonne to continue in-house R&D and offer technical support where needed.  In FY 1995, the FRA provided funds to Argonne to help conduct its congressionally mandated Commercial Feasibility Study (CFS), expected to be submitted to Congress this summer.
